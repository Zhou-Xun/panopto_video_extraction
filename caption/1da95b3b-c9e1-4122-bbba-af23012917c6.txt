1
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:16,660
All of that just to get started here. How are you guys doing? Mr. Whirlwind to work through capitals in two in Athens.

2
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:27,150
Paris. There's been a lot of our grants at these meetings, so that's really cool to see and we'll deal with as you walk through.

3
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:32,880
Okay. How did last week go with the. What are you talk about?

4
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,110
I asked her. He didn't tell me. What did you talk about?

5
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:42,380
Mm mm mm mm mm.

6
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:47,740
Yeah. Okay. He didn't use my slides, I don't think. So what did he talk about in particular?

7
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:54,100
Just in case. Look at restoration plans.

8
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:57,910
Yeah, I. Yeah, I like any particular ones.

9
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:05,050
Stand out in your memory. Mostly different based or.

10
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:10,640
Someone. I know one of them was, like, about a highway.

11
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:16,020
I can't. I'm quite important to her.

12
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:23,590
I think goes back a few years because I don't remember very well any pollution cases about.

13
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:31,870
It was terrific. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, he's he's an interesting guy.

14
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:36,300
He's got a number of innovative cases going on.

15
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:39,870
Works a lot in the EPA area in particular. Did he talk about her?

16
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:45,520
Did he criticize me before eating? Yeah.

17
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:49,889
I mean, it is not very effective for environmental justice. Okay.

18
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:59,250
I mean, you saw that the you know, if you look at the pipeline, you I mean, they did a really lousy analysis,

19
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:05,850
I think, you know, and by the way, that was in the first one, which is now graded.

20
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:12,960
Okay. So you can see how you did on a couple of you did do a couple of the courses.

21
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:19,500
So come and see me, okay? Because I want to give you more time if you need to do them.

22
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:24,960
Okay. Because I mean, the purpose of the quiz is just to reinforce materials.

23
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:34,530
Okay. So if you needed another chance, if you weren't happy with your score, if you didn't solve that equation, for example, you know, let me know.

24
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:39,030
I'll give you another chance. Okay. Or is that clear? Hmm.

25
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:50,280
Okay. I wanted today to move on to the first sort of thematic media oriented one on water quality.

26
00:02:50,640 --> 00:03:02,250
But before I do that, there is a couple of loose ends. Uh, one of them has to do with the quizzes and see if I can find the right window here.

27
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:09,950
Okay. So on Quiz one, just to give you a context, the average was 89.

28
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:13,460
The grades went from 65 to 100.

29
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,240
That's pretty good. I'd like to see the average above 90.

30
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:26,090
Okay. And there were really no standout problems with the quiz on this one.

31
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:38,360
The only thing I do want to say is one big weakness of Nipper and I can't find it.

32
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:43,190
Here is it has no evaluative components.

33
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:49,580
You do the document. You sign off. You do the public outreach.

34
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,030
You get a comment. Period comes back.

35
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,260
You change from the draft to the final. You sign off, you're done.

36
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:04,910
Okay. Doesn't matter if it's good or bad. You do what was specified in the requirements.

37
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:10,580
So it's administratively complete and no one can say anything else.

38
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,210
You're done.

39
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:19,940
So there's no real evaluation of the process, whether it was fair, where they got input from stakeholders that are legitimate people affected,

40
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:24,830
or whether it had greenhouse gas reductions handled appropriately or whatever.

41
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:28,610
So that's a real weakness. It's a public information law.

42
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:39,720
Okay. Is that bad? I mean, if you're a big company, Ethereum or Ford or somebody like that,

43
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:46,350
and you put out a plan and you really didn't even think about greenhouse gas or assume to emissions or water quality,

44
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:52,140
you're going to get a lot of bad press. Everybody's going to know about it so that project can go forward.

45
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:59,220
So the real benefit is sunshine and it stops bad projects from moving forward.

46
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:04,500
Okay. Sometimes that's the real benefit of NEPA process.

47
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:13,700
Thoughts on and. But agree you don't have to. I mean, it's some sunshine.

48
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:19,980
It's designed to incorporate, you know, environmental values in decision making, but it doesn't have to.

49
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:26,940
Okay. So perception plays an important role. So that's one big criticism.

50
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:30,570
I have no evaluation. Okay. Quiz three.

51
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:35,549
I'm not happy. Okay. This is the one that dealt with modeling.

52
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:42,480
The average was 81%. This is the one I did for you guys on the video.

53
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:53,550
So I realize there's some compromises with that. It also demonstrates to me that face to face is superior to video or remote.

54
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:57,000
Okay. Because I engage you, you look at me, I get feedback.

55
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:01,890
This score is typically lower, but 81 is a little on the low side.

56
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:12,930
Okay. The problem is that you don't grasp how these box models work.

57
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:17,820
Okay. Or at least some of you don't. And I have to get back into that.

58
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:22,260
And so this is these aren't bad scores.

59
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:25,500
Okay. But I want them to be higher. That's the main thing.

60
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:36,330
So I'm going to spend a couple of minutes going back to just demonstrate or talk about the this construct here.

61
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:44,430
Okay. What we call this fully third non-conservative chemical reactor.

62
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:55,990
Okay. So the main thing is the concept.

63
00:06:56,140 --> 00:07:05,440
That's what I'm after. Okay. I mean, if you go through and get the math and differential equation and solve that, I'm thrilled, but not necessary.

64
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:10,180
Okay. I want the intuitive, the intuition about what's going on in here.

65
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:21,790
Okay. So we have this box, and the idea of mass balance is we define the boundary of our system so that we track what goes through the boundary.

66
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:27,790
Okay. So in the quiz, I think I talked about it in door.

67
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:35,860
I'm sorry. In the lecture and in the quiz, an indoor air quality model we're sitting in space to, which is a giant box.

68
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:44,200
We're in this classroom, which is a smaller box. Okay, let's consider the air that comes in through the diffusers and exits somewhere.

69
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:48,520
Okay. Through the slot somewhere else. That's what's coming in.

70
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,300
Concentration theme the flow rate. Q In penetrating the boundary of the box.

71
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:59,410
Okay. What comes out through the concentration?

72
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:09,580
Q Out. Q In is equal to. Q Well, okay, I'm not pressurizing the space in here to any significant effect.

73
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:14,780
There's no leaks in the boundary. So every leader of A or I put in a leader has to come out.

74
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:18,770
Okay. You're with me on that. All right.

75
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:23,679
Now, I think in this one, yeah.

76
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,210
I gave this strange example of aerosols.

77
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:35,110
I don't care. You can consider this to be formaldehyde, benzene, particulate matter.

78
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:39,610
I don't care anything that you want. You can consider this to be your bathtub.

79
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,720
Okay. And you're flowing water into it, and it is draining out.

80
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:47,950
And the height of the bathtub is the same. Or it's Lake Michigan.

81
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:52,600
Same thing. I don't care. It's such a generic model. Okay.

82
00:08:55,250 --> 00:09:01,100
Give me your favorite analogy. Please let me show you.

83
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:06,110
All right. We have some disaster in Lake Michigan.

84
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:12,440
The Edmund Fitzgerald, you remember that wasn't in Lake Michigan.

85
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:18,320
Exactly. Split in half. Okay. And it released a whole bunch of something bad.

86
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:25,190
Nasty. Okay. In that case, we have a discharge inside the box.

87
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:29,970
This little propeller means it's fully mixed. Okay.

88
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:34,790
Which is harder to think about for Lake Michigan, because it's a huge lake.

89
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:43,040
Well, let's say it's fully mixed. That means the concentration of that nest over here is the same over here, same everywhere.

90
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:53,180
Okay. Lake Michigan is really interesting, Lake, because the inflow is only about 1% of the lake's volume.

91
00:09:55,010 --> 00:10:03,350
Okay. So that means if we were filling up Lake Michigan, let's say it was completely empty, would take a hundred years to fill up.

92
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:09,010
Okay. It's really, really slow. All right.

93
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:23,330
So let's assume for the sake of simplicity that this really nasty event that happened is fully mixed up in the concentration,

94
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:28,100
is whatever it is, distributed throughout the league and it's conservative.

95
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:33,480
What does that mean? No, no, no. No reaction, no decay.

96
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:40,129
It's there forever. Okay. It's something like an ionic compound, a PCB mercury.

97
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:43,550
It reacts very, very slowly. We can assume zero.

98
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:53,900
In 100 years, we get enough water to essentially refill the lake.

99
00:10:55,550 --> 00:11:01,370
Okay. The concentration, let's say initially, just to give you a number, is 100 inside here.

100
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:11,220
What's the concentration after a hundred years? Tell me why you say it's here.

101
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:17,520
Because if they're saying there's no real change happening, then there's a change.

102
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:29,970
Okay. Other thoughts? You put in one year's worth of water.

103
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:34,260
One year's worth of water comes out. Oh, okay.

104
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,280
You put it in, and it's tenuously mixed.

105
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:47,310
Mm hmm. So I. The only way your answer is correct is if it's not, well, mixed.

106
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:51,030
It's called what we call plug flow. Yeah.

107
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:54,899
Okay. Plug flow is the case where the water comes in.

108
00:11:54,900 --> 00:12:01,590
The new water is behind my hand, and it slowly pushes out like a piston and it squeezes it out.

109
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:05,940
So there's no mixing in front of my hand with behind my hand.

110
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:10,800
That's a completely different flow regime. Okay.

111
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:14,640
In that case, you're right. But that's not the reality.

112
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:18,240
Okay. And that's not the assumption, namely of this model.

113
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:23,410
The assumption of this model is that it's fully mixed. Okay.

114
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:27,190
That was the problem. The where the quiz was.

115
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:32,350
That makes sense to everybody. This idea of mixing is really critical.

116
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:39,310
There are some special cases where it's plug flow, but that's really unusual.

117
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:46,350
Okay. Complete mixing is also a fiction.

118
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:54,990
It's not that common, but it's a safer assumption in many cases, and in particular for dealing with the air in the room here.

119
00:12:55,470 --> 00:13:01,290
Yeah. If I cough, you're going to get my aerosols. It's going to be mixed throughout the space.

120
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:05,130
That's why I'm worried about protecting you. I have a little throat thing.

121
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:08,930
Now, it's not cool, though. Okay.

122
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:13,310
Questions on this. Yeah.

123
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:24,610
So what is the concentration? Okay, so I have to solve it as I did in this example with the bio aerosols.

124
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,030
And it's always going to have an exponential type of decay like that.

125
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:37,030
Okay. And so, you know, I went through this in the lectures, in the video.

126
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,920
Could you watch it again and see if you have questions? And then I'm happy to talk about it.

127
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:53,710
But basically, you have to figure out in the model, which is an analytical expression, we have a calculus solution right here.

128
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:58,960
It's a bit of a mess, but it's not that bad. You have to figure out this retention time.

129
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:04,910
If you don't have reaction and you don't have K and it's just one over the detention time,

130
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:09,640
how long it takes on average for a particle to come out or of that system.

131
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:16,060
And then you plug it in and if you don't have any initial concentration, this goes away.

132
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:28,540
And so you have really potentials of either starting off with a high concentration like I did in my example, and it decays exponentially.

133
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:32,920
Or in the case of a fireplace, you turn it on.

134
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:36,730
It's producing a certain amount of carbon monoxide. It's the opposite.

135
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:47,780
It builds up. Okay. And then they turned off the flame and again it decays exponentially.

136
00:14:49,700 --> 00:15:00,260
One of the quiz questions was similar to this idea about like having salt go into a lake versus like gas.

137
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:06,010
And so I asked some questions about like which compounds are conservative contaminants.

138
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:10,780
How would you know that? Just based on like the question. Yeah.

139
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:14,990
Good. Good question. Is it this question here? Yes.

140
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:20,809
Yep. Okay. So we're talking about a lake near a gas station.

141
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:25,070
Road salt and road salt is going to dissolve.

142
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:30,170
It's not going to evaporate any large extent. It's not going to react to any large extent.

143
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:38,270
So we could consider that to be conservative. So that in my head, it sounds like it's reasonable to consider Seattle as a conservative contaminant.

144
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:43,280
My point is reactive. This is incorrect.

145
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:49,700
This is ionic chloride. Yes. So it's just dissolved as in the water.

146
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:54,770
It could react a little bit, but it's not going to react like chlorine.

147
00:15:55,520 --> 00:16:01,520
Yeah. Okay, I suppose. Well, no, I mean, it will react.

148
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:06,050
But again, I mean, these are all practical definitions.

149
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:10,610
Okay. And in the timeframe with. So it's just going to be salty water.

150
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:14,930
Okay. Okay. And contrast the other part of the question.

151
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:22,170
Talking about gasoline. Okay. Gasoline is a mixture of alkanes and aromatics and things like that.

152
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:29,750
They evaporate. They react pretty fast. Uh, it would not be appropriate to consider that to be conservative.

153
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:34,780
Okay. We good?

154
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,630
Yeah. So that was another question.

155
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:54,530
Steady state is another issue. I'm less concerned about steady state, but basically if something is changing over time, it's not steady state.

156
00:16:55,460 --> 00:17:00,890
Okay. Interestingly, with the picture I just showed you of this.

157
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:15,070
It's a steady state. No, definitely not, because the amount of carbon, the amount of carbon monoxide in the space is definitely changing over time.

158
00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:22,960
Right now, we have here a case where, you know, you turn on the flame builds up.

159
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:31,090
At some point, this is going to level off. If they don't turn it off and the concentration will not change, then it would be at steady state.

160
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:40,270
Okay. And that's an important concept because basically the CEO is produced by incomplete combustion.

161
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:47,680
Right. What removes the seal? Broken windows and keep building up and up and up.

162
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:56,510
It's a box model. Just like this room, you have air flowing through.

163
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:59,960
So it's the ventilation that removes it. Okay.

164
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:03,350
So at the point where this level's off and it will level off,

165
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:11,330
you have certain SEO being produced in the same amount being removed by ventilation or that's steady state.

166
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:17,840
Okay. Because we're in balance at this point. Well, clearly, we're getting rid of CO2.

167
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:21,580
You no, we're being generated. It's being exhausted at this point.

168
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:25,070
It's being generated faster than it's being removed. Yeah.

169
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:30,680
So what about the example that you had or like with with the and the lake where

170
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:35,690
it has to initially fill up in room that would therefore change the state

171
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:40,580
because there is an initial volume or mass in the box model somewhat that considered

172
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:44,990
the not steady state since it has to fill because that would be changing.

173
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:48,530
Yeah. Yeah. Even a small period of time. Yeah. Most likely.

174
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:51,920
Right. So, I mean, a very simple example is you're filling up your bathtub.

175
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:56,690
Okay. And the water's rising. And let's see. You're tracking the amount of water.

176
00:18:56,690 --> 00:19:02,989
It's not at steady state. Okay? But then it hits the drain and excess goes out the drain.

177
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:06,290
And the height of the water in the bathtub is now constant.

178
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:09,830
Water's flowing in. The same amount is flowing out. Steady state.

179
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:17,720
Why do we care about steady state? It just makes my life easy.

180
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:22,430
That's all. Just makes things easy to understand and calculate. Yes.

181
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:28,309
So go back to that same first question, that concern benzine.

182
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:42,070
The system is a steady state. And so I thought the answer to that is no, because it says that the gasoline leaks into the lake mostly in the spring.

183
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,170
So I was thinking that was a seasonal change. Is that.

184
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:49,490
Well, yeah. So this is a little bit splitting hairs.

185
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:55,490
But even though most of the gasoline would be expected to evaporate, some of it will still be there.

186
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:58,730
Very small amount and the concentration will be change.

187
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:09,050
So it is not it's not a steady state because that contaminant is got, you know, processes going on the change level.

188
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:15,050
Okay. Think I warned you this was a hard chapter.

189
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:26,450
Okay. So I'm not worried. You've got to understand how fundamental this is, this building block to the way.

190
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,340
Oh, I don't know. Chemical engineers and modelers. Think about the world.

191
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:35,570
This could be your stomach.

192
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:41,150
A cell in your body. A constituent of a cell.

193
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:46,370
Okay. So, I mean, this can be applied at many, many different levels.

194
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:49,489
So it's quite scalable. Typically, though,

195
00:20:49,490 --> 00:21:00,170
the way we do it is the output of this goes into another reactor model and we concatenate them together to represent bigger systems,

196
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:04,700
whether it's a river like I'll talk about today or an atmosphere or whatever.

197
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:11,080
Okay. Okay. I do have a word for you for all.

198
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:15,440
Not in your heads later. But I'm serious.

199
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:30,260
Okay. Please look at this again. I mean, I recognize that this is, you know, a bit of applied math to see how it works.

200
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:41,720
And in particular, in this model, you know, you have the structures of concentration of height and key is equal to all the stuff that builds up.

201
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:48,110
That's the curve that goes up or in initial concentration with a straight exponential decay.

202
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:52,940
That's the part that goes down. And you can have both of those things happening in your model.

203
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:58,580
And that's what happened with this, I know, in our Arizona model.

204
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:04,910
Again, I don't want to get lost in the woods here. I just want you to make sure you understand.

205
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:09,980
Full mixing means it's not plug flow. Okay.

206
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:19,160
You know, another example? I wash the dishes and I have something dirty in here, and I pour out half the water, put in more water.

207
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:22,970
Did I get rid of all of the dirt in my glass? No.

208
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:28,370
Do it a second time. Now, I've poured in the full amount of water poured out half again.

209
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,270
But it's still got dirt in there. Okay. It's just an exponential process.

210
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:37,820
How? I could give you some other examples, but I think you've got it.

211
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:42,920
Okay. We good? Okay.

212
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:59,340
Then I talked about model verification, validation, evaluation, calibration.

213
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:06,360
Okay. These are terms that, you know, are important, misused frequently.

214
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:08,219
If you're going to speak to modelers,

215
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:18,810
you want to make sure that there's language and then a few things with statistical evaluation and sensitivity analysis.

216
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:22,680
And we'll do a little bit of sensitivity analysis in homeworks.

217
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:28,020
Okay. The idea for sensitivity is to see what matters in the model.

218
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:36,720
Typically, a complex model will have hundreds of input variables, cost you money to figure out what each one of those are.

219
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:40,740
Put your money where? Where it matters. Okay.

220
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:50,159
Figure out what's sensitive. And the way I throw it at you in here is just to define the sensitivity.

221
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:54,440
Is the change in the output divided by a change in the input? Okay.

222
00:23:54,450 --> 00:24:00,150
Or we can normalize it to a nominal value and then we don't have to worry about the units as much.

223
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:12,190
That's it. What is the deal? I think I was going a little too fast.

224
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:19,750
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

225
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:32,350
The thing is, the change, the differential. Okay. And so, I mean, the example that I gave here is you change something by 10%.

226
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:41,590
Okay. And if the output changes by, let's say, 20%, which is certainly possible, that might be a sensitive parameter for you.

227
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:51,700
On the other hand, changing some other parameter XA by if would be is two or 200 by 10% maybe made no change in Y.

228
00:24:52,360 --> 00:25:00,040
It's insensitive to that. And when you say no, I mean this could be like the average value.

229
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:09,190
Okay. So I would calculate a 10% increase from the nominal value.

230
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:15,250
So I could then use the nominal value in both cases and it just gets rid of the units.

231
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:25,880
Okay. Other questions on all this math. Okay.

232
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:43,300
So there's an entirely different unit now. Here we're going to talk about surface water quality.

233
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:50,709
The objectives are to provide an overview of this in just a couple of hours.

234
00:25:50,710 --> 00:26:01,450
Really? It's a lot of stuff. I'll focus more on the ambient side of things rather than drinking water side of things or processed water.

235
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:08,590
We'll talk about some standards, talk about various types of models that are used to protect surface water.

236
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:15,430
Basically, river models of dissolved oxygen models and leak models.

237
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:21,160
Again, these will be mass balance processes. So there's a physical basis to it.

238
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:29,230
It's not just a statistical correlation, but in fact it uses the process like the fully stored chemical reactor model.

239
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:38,380
There are additional processes that we need to add. The advection diffusion and dispersion.

240
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:43,660
And we'll talk about that. We'll talk briefly about one of the EPA models.

241
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:50,500
And then at the end, move on to some bioaccumulation by concentration pharmacokinetic models.

242
00:26:52,420 --> 00:27:00,220
So that's a lot of stuff to cover. The goal here again is to talk about indicators from day one.

243
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:04,540
I mentioned indicators. I want to pound this down. Get this in there.

244
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:13,420
I want you to have an understanding of some of the models that are used, including their theory, the development and practical application.

245
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:23,080
We're going to use some simple math balance models and demonstrate things like sensitivity and maybe optimization.

246
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:27,400
And then I want you to get a sense of some of the limitations.

247
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Okay. There's not so much specific for the readings.

248
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,160
There are lots of recommended things.

249
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:52,900
I've provided some introductory materials on ecosystems, on non-point pollution sources, on drinking water challenges.

250
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:59,470
This is good background if you haven't had much readings before and surface water.

251
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:04,030
A lot of our issues are point sources. Okay.

252
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:11,020
These are industries, factories, whatever. A very large number are also non-point sources.

253
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:15,760
Okay. And this can be agricultural runoff to off courses,

254
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:29,290
things like this atmospheric deposition for an area that encompasses even a greater diversity of topics.

255
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:40,540
I have the Kalamazoo River Natural Resource Damage Assessment, which is a year that was prepared by Noah,

256
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:46,770
Michigan and others with the authorship by this consulting firm, APT.

257
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:52,900
Okay. They're pretty good firm. They have offices all over the place.

258
00:28:54,290 --> 00:29:01,390
You know, a lot of the consulting firms have really consolidated. So they're huge and they work globally, basically.

259
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:07,210
I'd like you to take a look at this. Yes, I think it introduces some very nice concepts.

260
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:12,640
Okay. It's easy to read. There's some optional readings here.

261
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,970
They're a little dated now,

262
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:23,890
but if you're into phosphorus and critical loads and nutrients and algal blooms and things like this, these are still good.

263
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:29,560
The AJC is a really unique organization.

264
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:33,100
Does anybody know about it? International Joint Commission.

265
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:40,120
Exactly. It was set up under a treaty between Canada and the US to do all kinds of things.

266
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:45,220
Okay. It's is it 100 years old clothes getting up there?

267
00:29:46,900 --> 00:30:00,950
Okay. I don't remember exactly. And then some standards from EPA and Michigan and W.H.O.

268
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:11,590
And some more things. And some Web resources.

269
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:14,690
There's so much stuff. Okay. Pictures first.

270
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:19,960
Talk about indicators. Some countries are blessed with lots of water.

271
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:26,830
Okay. This happens to be upper Finland. Other countries are really water short.

272
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:32,050
Okay. So the first thing with water is we have a quantity issue.

273
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:34,240
Okay. And that's really important.

274
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:42,640
Often when we have poor quantities, like here in, I believe, Bangladesh, we also have this can be Bangladesh and say my own behind it.

275
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:47,470
We often have water quality issues as well in the US.

276
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:53,680
Katrina now what, 15 years ago was kind of a wakeup call.

277
00:30:55,060 --> 00:31:01,480
You know, tremendous amount of flooding. In New Orleans, you can see the portion that's just flooded here.

278
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:15,300
I have wonderful examples of mold, restoration and damage because so many homes were submerged, flood cuts to protect the buildings had to be so high.

279
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:24,790
I mean, it was just an enormous amount of damage. Last week when we had Ian in Florida, a lot of similar stories there.

280
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:33,550
Here's an interesting situation with an impoundment in Europe must be treating some sort

281
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:42,490
of metal waste and it leaked it breached the confinement area and it's just a total mess.

282
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:45,640
This is in in the Budapest area in Hungary.

283
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:49,690
Okay. A very different type of water quality problem.

284
00:31:52,190 --> 00:32:03,220
There is little cap. Remember the Deepwater Horizon, the hypnotic videos of the plume coming out of the sediment which couldn't be stopped?

285
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:08,230
I put this in here because it's probably one of the largest water quality issues

286
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:14,350
in terms of the settlement that was reached from this Deepwater Horizon facility.

287
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,320
And it was stopped. It was capped, what, like a month or two later.

288
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:30,490
Took a long time to cap that off. And some 185 million gallons of crude oil is estimated to have spilled into the Gulf.

289
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:44,830
And that's not a video, I don't think. But that was that the plumes resulting from that know how they sort of dispersed if they get mixed.

290
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:51,410
Very complex pattern of wind and waves and currents will dominate.

291
00:32:51,460 --> 00:33:01,450
But in this case, they put booms to try to isolate some of the islands.

292
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:11,510
Coming back home and I think this slides out of order is an algal bloom.

293
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:19,470
You can see it was green pool on the west side of Lake Erie, you know.

294
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:24,320
So here's the BP settlement, $21 billion, pretty massive.

295
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:33,080
It also killed 11 workers in the millennium drought.

296
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:44,110
Have you guys heard of this? So if you were living in Colorado, in Colorado, in California, it's going to get really, really tough there.

297
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:50,899
We have so much. Drainage from the main reservoirs.

298
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:57,540
And at the Colorado River, Lake Mead is 27% full.

299
00:33:57,890 --> 00:34:06,680
It fell 45 feet in the last two years. Lake Powell, 22% forward, fell 70 feet.

300
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:10,940
I mean, this is pretty astounding. All right. We have a few years left.

301
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:16,130
This millennium drought started in 2000. It's in the 23rd year.

302
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:19,840
40 million people depend on water from this river.

303
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,540
Do they know why it's dropping so much?

304
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:28,010
Yeah. There's no rain. There's no snowfall. The demand is just the same.

305
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:33,820
We like to eat our vegetables and nuts and fruits and everything. Drink that wine from California.

306
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:37,130
Right. So all irrigated. Every bit of it.

307
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:42,050
Plus the little plots of land, the trees, the grass.

308
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:50,150
Okay, so this is a case where the supply doesn't come close to meeting the demand.

309
00:34:50,630 --> 00:35:02,500
Huge, huge issues. I had a friends in graduate school way back that worked on water allocation and water rights.

310
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:07,780
Okay. There's some old, old treaties. And who consumes most of the water?

311
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:19,150
It's agriculture in this area. Okay. I mean, it's it's so essential for for us to go back to algal blooms.

312
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:28,930
This is a picture of this green slime, this harmful algal bloom near water intake near Toledo.

313
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:35,850
In fact, a few years ago, they had to shut off the water supply to Toledo because this stuff was coming in.

314
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:42,729
Okay. And it's a water intake.

315
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:48,360
It's also called a crib. In Lake Erie.

316
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:52,410
Down at the bottom here is the warmest lake.

317
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:56,640
It's gets the lot of fertilizer input.

318
00:35:57,330 --> 00:36:12,420
It has had these phosphorus issues that are often a critical or limiting nutrient, allowing sort of unchecked growth in these harmful algal blooms.

319
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:22,499
In this case, the flushing time for the lake is only two and a half years compared to the 99 years that I talked about for Lake Michigan.

320
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:27,390
So it flushes out a lot faster. It's much smaller lake, though, to.

321
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:42,390
These harmful algal blooms have been a somewhat recent phenomenon that are starting to be linked to all sorts of diseases.

322
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,380
Okay. And they're really potentially quite toxic.

323
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:54,390
We've been very interested in studying system, micro system and some of the other toxics associated with it.

324
00:36:55,200 --> 00:37:05,250
This stuff is typically quite low levels where it can cause these adverse health effects and it includes,

325
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:11,340
you know, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, diarrhea, liver inflammation, pneumonia.

326
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:23,340
Some of the evidence is also showing the associations with neurological problems because some of the toxins are neuro active in any event.

327
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:28,740
You know, when this harmful algal bloom approaches, the water intake,

328
00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:37,300
typically treatment systems don't do a very good job at removing these things, this micro system down to that one microgram per liter level.

329
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:44,760
So they typically try not to let that water come into the lake, into the water treatment facility.

330
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:55,710
So a lot of texture. You can look at it. It's mostly blue green algae, but it can contain these toxins.

331
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,910
This has been happening for a long time. For a long time.

332
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:07,830
But it's increased due to more and more discharges of nitrogen and phosphorus and warmer temperatures.

333
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:25,680
Okay, so the two go hand in hand. There are some standards for Microsystems, which I report below.

334
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:37,830
Again, they're all in the pretty low microgram per liter range, and this problem seems to be increasing.

335
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:45,300
So I've copied some materials from the Sea Grant program here that explains in a little bit more detail.

336
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:53,219
They also implicate leaking septic systems, but it's probably mostly agricultural runoff,

337
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:59,100
non-point runoff and to some extent point sources like wastewater treatment plants.

338
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:10,240
The other aspect, which they point out are invasive species like zebra mussels,

339
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:18,460
which filter out other algae which would otherwise keep this harmful algal bloom in check.

340
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:24,250
So we instead of having that diversity of species, we don't anymore.

341
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:32,290
And that allows these harmful algal blooms to proliferate.

342
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:50,550
This is a picture of the phosphorus loading into Lake Erie from 1967 through 2011 and some of the different sources in this case,

343
00:39:50,870 --> 00:40:03,840
the this is tributaries that are monitored that are mostly agricultural runoff, and there's not very much atmospheric deposition.

344
00:40:04,410 --> 00:40:08,820
The orange is one monitored area. There is still a bit that's not known.

345
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:15,690
But the loading, you know, is relatively flat after initial decreases in the eighties.

346
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:26,540
What's amazing to me and many others, I think, is that during warm weather seasons,

347
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:33,560
in particularly hot periods, we can have entire rivers with a harmful algal bloom.

348
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:38,780
And this happened back, what, about six years ago, I think.

349
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:50,210
And most of the Ohio River was considered to be toxic due to the harmful algal bloom.

350
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:57,470
So this is a real disaster. And because these rivers are used for drinking water.

351
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:10,680
And this was 2015. This is kind of an impact also of climate change because more of this will happen on particularly hot days or hot seasons.

352
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:13,680
You know, the picture of the.

353
00:41:18,090 --> 00:41:28,250
Uh, again, if any of you are good with websites, you could make pictures like this and show tracking maps and things like this.

354
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:32,600
This is 2019 algal blooms. So it's a it's a widespread problem.

355
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:38,690
We're particularly interested in some of the inland leaks that may also have harmful algal blooms.

356
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:42,380
So it doesn't have to be just big rivers or the Great Lakes.

357
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:48,170
And some of the toxins are identified on the left side.

358
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:59,350
This happens all over the world. This is the case in Italy a few years back.

359
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:12,510
I won't go through that in Michigan. From our local rag, Ann Arbor News now, eight years ago, they highlighted ten water quality problems.

360
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:16,080
It's interesting to look at them. First one, of course, is Flint.

361
00:42:16,090 --> 00:42:23,080
Everybody knows about Flint. Upper north pipe suffer polar vortex.

362
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:30,290
Okay, so these old cast iron pipes break and freeze, and then you have all kinds of problems.

363
00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:35,290
What do you have to do when a pipe breaks? You can't drink that water, right?

364
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:43,480
Because water will rush into it from the ground. Water, potentially even sewage has to be pressurized, has to be purged.

365
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:49,839
You're on a boil water advisory for quite a long time too.

366
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:54,580
Is the Toledo water algae from a harmful algal bloom three.

367
00:42:54,790 --> 00:43:00,670
I don't know much about it since Bay City gets a needle in a haystack from pipe failure.

368
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:06,910
Five was the old infrastructure in Detroit.

369
00:43:06,910 --> 00:43:17,940
This has been in the news because they had a ten foot main break and they lost water to a large number of their surface area.

370
00:43:17,950 --> 00:43:24,780
They serve over 4 million people. Six is what the ice is about.

371
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:31,200
The Kalamazoo River, a beautiful river, but it's had its ups and downs.

372
00:43:31,470 --> 00:43:38,959
What's the problem with the Kalamazoo River? Yes.

373
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:42,140
We had one of the oil spills occur.

374
00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:46,140
What else? Yeah.

375
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:51,090
I might be wrong about the contaminant from the paper mill, but he said PCBs.

376
00:43:51,110 --> 00:43:55,290
That's right. And that's what most of this is about. Okay.

377
00:43:55,310 --> 00:44:00,260
So that's really an interesting combination of stresses on the Kalamazoo River.

378
00:44:01,810 --> 00:44:07,220
Uh, this is from 2015. This is still in the press.

379
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:11,450
Mackinaw Street's pipeline line. Five crosses here.

380
00:44:11,450 --> 00:44:15,290
So, Saint Marie, if that were to break, it would be a disaster.

381
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:23,600
Grand River floodplain. I don't know much about this Acme Maya run off site.

382
00:44:25,070 --> 00:44:29,690
I don't know much about that. Farmville over farming chemicals don't know much about that.

383
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:42,469
I think I would add Wixom Chromium and p fast spill effect in the Ann Arbor River and we'll talk about that if we have time.

384
00:44:42,470 --> 00:44:46,550
At the end of the day anyway, that's their top ten list.

385
00:44:51,070 --> 00:44:54,430
In the Flynn case. It was really interesting. Where does the lead come from?

386
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:03,370
The pipes? Yeah. Which pipes? So it's mostly the service line.

387
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:07,120
So this picture is showing you the water main.

388
00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:14,150
Okay. That's it's typically in the street. Water mains can be, you know, six inches can be larger.

389
00:45:15,310 --> 00:45:21,280
They have connections to them. A curb stop. It's called a service line that goes into the house.

390
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:25,600
Water shut off a meter in this particular case. The configuration can vary.

391
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:32,470
Flint had roughly 13,000 service lines that were made out of lead.

392
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:37,030
Okay. And those lead service lines will last forever.

393
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:42,130
There's nothing wrong with that, except that they're lit. They don't corrode.

394
00:45:46,490 --> 00:45:53,570
Why was there a problem all of a sudden in 2014 and flipped the switch to the Flint River?

395
00:45:53,870 --> 00:46:04,670
Yeah. So under emergency city manager jurisdiction, which is allows the governor to appoint an individual to basically run the place,

396
00:46:05,090 --> 00:46:12,380
they decided not to add $100 worth of anti-corrosion chemicals each day when they switched over.

397
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:19,430
And that led to very rapid acceleration of corrosion in the pipes, including lead service.

398
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:24,830
And that discolored and led to contamination in in the homes.

399
00:46:29,470 --> 00:46:33,910
These, I think, are slides from Mark Edwards at UVA.

400
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:40,440
University of Virginia. It was interesting. We were talking about how to respond to this and he actually did it.

401
00:46:41,050 --> 00:46:47,290
So this sort of community based sampling and sent them back to him.

402
00:46:48,130 --> 00:46:55,959
And then Hanna-Attisha, the pediatrician who comes by you again once in a while, got very mobilized.

403
00:46:55,960 --> 00:47:00,700
And basically, this is her key paper, okay, from the Flint crisis.

404
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:07,390
What's actually very interesting in this is the number of children whose blood lead levels increased.

405
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:11,980
It was very, very small and the increase was also very, very small.

406
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:17,200
Okay. But the water looked terrible, couldn't be, you know, tasted bad.

407
00:47:17,830 --> 00:47:21,670
There's tremendous amount of psychological stress associated with this event.

408
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:29,110
And, of course, this occurred in a very disadvantaged neighborhood as well.

409
00:47:29,950 --> 00:47:38,889
So she talked about acute childhood experiences or AC e and that's probably the major

410
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:47,440
impact because these kids were a bit traumatized to be going through this whole debacle.

411
00:47:48,430 --> 00:47:52,870
I'm not belittling the lead, but lead levels tend to increase that much.

412
00:47:56,200 --> 00:48:02,670
Anyway, she has some maps showing you where they did increase based on water sampling.

413
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:14,560
I can talk about this forever. We have led sampling programs that I think are flawed and I will talk about this more, but that's the current rule.

414
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:25,090
Michigan did revise Lead Copper Act a little bit to address some of this, but it's still, in my opinion, a very flawed rule.

415
00:48:26,590 --> 00:48:35,520
You wonder why. Well, for one thing, it uses a 90th percentile.

416
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:43,950
So if you sample 100 homes, you take the 90th highest or go down from ten from the top.

417
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:53,880
It doesn't matter what those ten are. Okay. If the 10th one down from the top is below 15 micrograms per liter, you're home three.

418
00:48:55,530 --> 00:49:03,210
Okay. Utilities tend to sample the same homes so they never really get a good representation of what's going on.

419
00:49:07,270 --> 00:49:12,310
Very few cities actually sample 100. You can sample 30 homes and that might be enough.

420
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:25,180
It doesn't represent what people drink because it's a sample collected after at least six or 8 hours of quiescent water use.

421
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:33,310
And the EPA rule is you take the first leader and typically the service line water.

422
00:49:33,850 --> 00:49:41,630
If you go back to this picture here, the first leader will get the water that's in the pipe right here.

423
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:45,370
The lead surface line is down here so you can change the rules.

424
00:49:45,370 --> 00:49:52,150
So you have to sample a fifth liter so that pulls water in through the out of the service line to the tap.

425
00:49:52,270 --> 00:49:58,820
So that's an improvement. We worked hard to get them to do that, but nationally that's not required.

426
00:50:02,550 --> 00:50:15,320
Anyway. Those are some reasons. Other problems in Flint were bacterial Legionnaires disease, for example.

427
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:21,440
It's a bacteria that causes death in about 10% of the people that get it.

428
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:30,730
So it's quite bad. The attack rate is low, but the fatality is is quite high in other waterborne diseases like Sugarloaf.

429
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:40,210
All right. That's anyway, just a snapshot of some ideas that we might think of as indicators.

430
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:50,020
These typically don't find their way into pieces because they're dealing much more with project level aspects,

431
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:56,290
smaller scale, typically dealing with impacts on streams and rivers and ponds and estuaries.

432
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:09,520
But we'll talk about the water quality standards and some of the classical classic stressors like oxygen depleting substances and chemicals.

433
00:51:10,210 --> 00:51:13,930
And let's take a turn for break.

434
00:51:17,770 --> 00:51:23,950
Yeah, let's take a break. Okay. For 5 minutes. And on your way, a little something for you.

435
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:32,230
So I brought you the finest French chocolates, so seriously.

436
00:51:34,870 --> 00:51:53,740
Yeah. So leave me some the. You just know they're not letting me out of my sleep.

437
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:16,030
I think there might be a couple, but they're all supposed to be intense.

438
00:52:21,590 --> 00:52:32,830
Thank you. Thank. Yes, definitely.

439
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:39,990
What's. What's. Thank you. Yeah.

440
00:52:41,290 --> 00:52:51,730
Yeah. Don't ask me. In Greek, I can't remember. So limited sampling technique to go to see any changes?

441
00:52:51,970 --> 00:52:55,930
Yeah, definitely. The level of noncompliance went up.

442
00:52:56,920 --> 00:53:04,180
Okay. I mean, if you sample the first liter, essentially what you're getting is corrosion that occurs in the faucet itself,

443
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:07,839
which could be because it's a brass faucet.

444
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:11,710
Brass is a mixture of lead and copper and zinc and stuff.

445
00:53:12,070 --> 00:53:27,930
Or in the solder right there. But it's not a service line. It's good.

446
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:45,170
All right. I'm still jet, you know.

447
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:57,980
We figure it out on the way back. If we go like Athens in 7 hours, Paris in 6 hours.

448
00:53:58,790 --> 00:54:02,510
Lisbon is 5 hours. I need a place to go for 4 hours.

449
00:54:03,770 --> 00:54:09,290
And I'm not sure where that is. Is cause of the Azores is one hour difference?

450
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:14,930
I've been I've been there a couple of times in the last couple of weeks.

451
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:18,440
Outstanding. There you go. Yeah. Yeah.

452
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:24,440
There's a version of Nine Islands, about a hundred, 200,000 people on English.

453
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:34,309
Thank you. I'm not taking a second. I just want you to take a second look at this one.

454
00:54:34,310 --> 00:54:42,470
The darker the crystal and the red. But then what's the real broadcast one in South America?

455
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:57,409
That would be well. So in 2 hours would have I mean Newfoundland and stuff.

456
00:54:57,410 --> 00:55:02,360
It's just one hour. It doesn't go all the way to the Lake Saint John's area.

457
00:55:02,570 --> 00:55:06,560
Yeah, but I know. I don't know if it's 2 hours. It might be.

458
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:32,110
We have been in contact with some people from Eagle last year doing the persons testing in Mosquito Lake and the White League.

459
00:55:32,230 --> 00:55:35,970
Mm hmm. Yeah. Your last football season lasted late in November.

460
00:55:37,090 --> 00:55:44,860
Yeah, you know, and they had levels all the way down to two that were in the 300.

461
00:55:47,110 --> 00:55:50,380
Yeah. Yeah, I neglected to say. I mean, the season just sort of started.

462
00:55:50,750 --> 00:55:54,820
Yeah. We're having a cooler fall.

463
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:59,260
So this year we don't expect this to be a problem.

464
00:55:59,590 --> 00:56:03,190
But last year, about last year, we had.

465
00:56:05,610 --> 00:56:12,960
I'm going to lose track of time in reference to your last year, three or four years ago was really bad.

466
00:56:13,410 --> 00:56:29,430
But I don't think it's been quite as bad. There are relatively few hard measurements of this.

467
00:56:29,430 --> 00:56:37,650
We we're trying to use satellite data but we didn't have the ability the ground truth it and.

468
00:56:41,570 --> 00:56:45,940
There's a brief, but studies very interesting. So, I don't know.

469
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:55,190
I'm still looking for a way to do it. I know that we operated our lab trying to use spectral flyovers in combination with some

470
00:56:55,190 --> 00:56:59,000
focusing on chlorophyl readings from our view to try to ground truth a little bit.

471
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:07,850
And I know you've participated in some drives out of Lake Erie, some ground truth since pressure fibers.

472
00:57:08,370 --> 00:57:15,620
Well, so I don't know if any of the satellite data is going to do all this.

473
00:57:15,620 --> 00:57:24,319
I think it does matter about satellite. These were just I actually have no idea what they did, the flyovers with the the drone.

474
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:34,760
But I've seen the drone so I have no idea about this was I mean, this was going on you know, aircraft that we use last year actually for other things.

475
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:43,280
But they don't give you enough time to do it regularly in they can't afford to do nothing, so just do it in this.

476
00:57:43,770 --> 00:57:47,870
So I told them I wanted to get going on their flights and they laughed.

477
00:57:48,620 --> 00:57:53,460
But you know, why not? You don't have safety procedures to work.

478
00:57:55,050 --> 00:58:00,880
And. But they spent about ten days in the Detroit area.

479
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:09,049
And yeah, you know, you're totally dependent on weather as well as for a lot of this stuff requires clear skies.

480
00:58:09,050 --> 00:58:14,190
So if you have clouds, it doesn't work. So certainly it's better if you can do it.

481
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:24,170
The resolution to capture small lakes and the people out there before making a machine makes a lot more sense.

482
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:33,600
Yeah. So we will actually want to get individual level estimates of exposure and so we know where people live.

483
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:41,550
In theory, we should accept some error because, you know, we don't know exactly where they get the water from.

484
00:58:41,850 --> 00:58:46,170
But if it's an error saying they're doing that, that could thing.

485
00:58:51,620 --> 00:59:28,820
To you're. Hmm.

486
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:44,400
Okay. Well, let's get going again here. So one of the reasons that I gave you as an optional reading was the old EPA 28 report.

487
00:59:44,410 --> 00:59:48,070
This was the indicators report that was still a hard copy. So I like that.

488
00:59:49,060 --> 00:59:56,830
But the newer ones to kind of maintain the same sort of categories for water quality concerns, you know,

489
00:59:56,830 --> 01:00:03,909
obviously we're concerned about fresh water and fresh water comes in the form of rivers and streams and lakes and ponds and so forth.

490
01:00:03,910 --> 01:00:07,210
Obviously, Michigan, we're blessed with the Great Lakes and all the other.

491
01:00:08,140 --> 01:00:11,530
There's also water below the surface. We call that groundwater.

492
01:00:11,530 --> 01:00:21,070
If you can pull out of the groundwater such that it's economically cheap enough to use Michigan in the area has a lot of groundwater as well.

493
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:29,440
We have wetlands that are either permanently or temporarily inundated or saturated by water,

494
01:00:30,670 --> 01:00:35,830
rarely used for drinking water, but obviously important for ecological purposes.

495
01:00:37,390 --> 01:00:42,370
There's coastal wetlands, there's drinking water like we talked about with flint and bottled water.

496
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:48,520
Another water quality concern isn't so much for consumption, but instead is for recreation.

497
01:00:48,940 --> 01:00:54,040
And so we're concerned about direct contact with water for swimming, fishing and boating.

498
01:00:54,640 --> 01:01:02,920
And then, of course, we like to eat the stuff that grows in water and lives in water.

499
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:10,300
So we're concerned about consumable fish and shellfish and, you know, contaminants can buy accumulate as we'll talk about.

500
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:19,540
So maintaining suitability of these habitats to grow fish and shellfish for human and wildlife consumption is important.

501
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:29,080
So this is one system of classifying water quality concerns in those different types of compartments.

502
01:01:29,290 --> 01:01:35,290
We care about water quality parameters. These parameters include temperature.

503
01:01:35,890 --> 01:01:40,030
P.H. Conductivity, turbidity.

504
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:44,470
Conductivity is a measure of how easily electricity will pass through.

505
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:50,770
It's an indirect indicator of contaminants. Turbidity has to do with how cloudy the water is.

506
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:57,700
It's both a indicator of esthetics as well as sediment levels and so forth.

507
01:01:58,060 --> 01:02:01,840
Total dissolved solids, tds. Total Suspended Solids.

508
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:05,350
Biological Oxygen Demand. Chemical oxygen demand.

509
01:02:05,350 --> 01:02:08,979
Total oxygen content, dissolved oxygen.

510
01:02:08,980 --> 01:02:16,990
All of these we'll talk about a little bit more, but they are all related to using the oxygen that's present in the water.

511
01:02:17,410 --> 01:02:23,290
And if you have a lot of chemicals or biological oxygen demanding substances,

512
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:28,330
you will reduce the amount of oxygen and that will lead to fish kills and so forth.

513
01:02:28,990 --> 01:02:35,979
Nutrients, minerals, salts, metals, toxics, coliforms, radioactivity, carcinogens, different species, biological, diverse.

514
01:02:35,980 --> 01:02:41,470
I mean, there's so many things you can measure with it, but these are all parameters that relate to water quality.

515
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:52,450
Many folks are often concerned with geophysical characteristics that are also serving as water quality indicators.

516
01:02:52,450 --> 01:02:56,440
There are listed here hydrologic indicators.

517
01:02:56,890 --> 01:03:00,310
The amount of surface and groundwater meteorology can be important.

518
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:07,450
There's if you're dealing with water treatment, water systems, there are indicators for that.

519
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:14,890
If you're dealing with wastewater, more indicators I've already mentioned water quality, quantity as well as quality.

520
01:03:15,340 --> 01:03:25,250
And then recently water affordability has become another indicator, although I have yet to see any, I guess that incorporates the interest.

521
01:03:27,430 --> 01:03:31,900
So this is way too much for us to look at. We're going to look at the pollution related indicators.

522
01:03:32,530 --> 01:03:38,590
Okay. But I do want you to be aware that there are all of these other classes of water quality indicators.

523
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:49,070
Again, EPA suggests lots of different indicators.

524
01:03:50,300 --> 01:03:53,840
This list here is important.

525
01:03:55,010 --> 01:04:01,010
Most of the year we'll look at some of these like high and low stream flows.

526
01:04:01,310 --> 01:04:07,400
The range of flows as well as the middle, middle or medium flow can be really important.

527
01:04:07,940 --> 01:04:16,940
I think that's discussed in the Kalamazoo is very nicely acidity and so forth.

528
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:23,750
So again, another list of indicators. Many of these focusing on nitrogen and phosphorus.

529
01:04:24,230 --> 01:04:27,980
Why these are limiting nutrients for algal blooms.

530
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:36,410
Okay. And algal blooms lead to a lot of problems, harmful algal blooms in toxic conditions, fish kills and so forth.

531
01:04:38,300 --> 01:04:50,240
So EPA, in their various reports, go through rivers and streams and lakes and look at these indicators.

532
01:04:51,020 --> 01:05:00,020
This is giving you a bar graph from seventies, eighties, nineties to look at the changes.

533
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:04,100
You can see some smaller changes, some dramatic changes.

534
01:05:04,460 --> 01:05:13,610
For example, 38.6% of the sites that they looked at, 867 and increased time flows.

535
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:22,640
What's the problem with that? Yeah.

536
01:05:23,410 --> 01:05:31,790
Lady Rosen. Yeah. So what you have basically is channel ization, and so you've lost the sort of riparian habitat.

537
01:05:31,790 --> 01:05:36,980
It scours all the stuff away. It's not good for fish or even esthetics.

538
01:05:38,270 --> 01:05:56,050
So that's one dramatic change in the nineties. In terms of looking at systems that have low, moderate or high levels of nitrogen or phosphorus.

539
01:05:56,710 --> 01:06:07,680
You know, we have roughly half of the surface water quality systems with relatively high levels of nitrogen and phosphorus.

540
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:16,200
So that's bad. Lots of nitrogen around is nitrate or is total nitrogen.

541
01:06:16,620 --> 01:06:25,320
And again, depending on where you cut this, it's probably more than half for these watersheds in these 38 basins.

542
01:06:27,260 --> 01:06:33,930
I'm looking at pesticide levels and the number of benchmarks that are exceeded.

543
01:06:33,930 --> 01:06:37,350
Each pesticide has an aquatic life benchmark.

544
01:06:37,740 --> 01:06:45,990
In other words, if it exceeds that, there may be an impact on typically insects or some other species.

545
01:06:46,350 --> 01:06:51,270
And again, adding these are roughly half there are human benchmarks.

546
01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:56,040
You're worried about 9%, which exceed at least one benchmark.

547
01:07:02,570 --> 01:07:07,309
EPA in their water quality handbooks define indicators.

548
01:07:07,310 --> 01:07:10,180
So this is probably the third definition I've given you.

549
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:19,040
There's a numerical value in this case from measurements of pressure, state or ambient condition of human health or ecological condition,

550
01:07:19,790 --> 01:07:24,710
whose trends over time represent or draw attention to underlying trends in the condition of the environment.

551
01:07:25,370 --> 01:07:36,260
All right. So it's kind of a verbose definition, but again, it identifies with the specifics and how it's used over time.

552
01:07:37,340 --> 01:07:41,560
I like this, though, because it has all of these other attributes.

553
01:07:41,570 --> 01:07:46,430
Okay. Which is useful when you think about which indicator you should select.

554
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:56,180
Basically, you know, in addition to answering the question, it should be objective, transparent, reproducible, which there should be sound collection,

555
01:07:56,840 --> 01:08:03,470
data collection methodologies, it should be available, should be comparable across time and space and representative.

556
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:06,410
So these are general goals for indicators.

557
01:08:12,380 --> 01:08:21,770
Periodically, approximately every ten years, EPA provides a report to Congress about the nation's water quality.

558
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:29,090
This particular report, they assessed about 23% of the rivers and streams.

559
01:08:29,150 --> 01:08:38,180
This is an old report, but they didn't update this in the last few years that I've seen.

560
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:51,640
And I want to go through some of this to give you a sense of where the problems are of the nation's total stream and river mileage.

561
01:08:51,650 --> 01:08:55,130
3 million miles. 23% was assessed.

562
01:08:55,550 --> 01:08:59,660
Of that, about 35% was impaired.

563
01:09:02,940 --> 01:09:06,270
What causes impairments in rivers and streams.

564
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:18,120
A number of different factors. This is important. We have aquatic life support.

565
01:09:18,570 --> 01:09:24,180
In other words, are levels appropriate for fish and birds and so forth?

566
01:09:25,320 --> 01:09:33,270
Generally, conditions are okay for good, fair or not attainable.

567
01:09:34,980 --> 01:09:45,090
Everything to the right here represents a problem. So about 30% of the mild problems with aquatic life support fish consumption.

568
01:09:46,590 --> 01:09:49,710
A smaller percentage. Primary swimming contact.

569
01:09:50,190 --> 01:09:53,610
A larger percentage. Secondary contact.

570
01:09:53,610 --> 01:09:57,360
About the same. Drinking water supply and agriculture.

571
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:04,990
Again. What causes those problems listed here?

572
01:10:05,410 --> 01:10:09,969
Filtration pathogens and nutrients. Oxygen depleting substances.

573
01:10:09,970 --> 01:10:14,230
And then some chemicals and habitat alteration and thermal modifications.

574
01:10:15,370 --> 01:10:23,740
Okay. So what this is saying is siltation, pathogens, nutrients, oxygen depleting substances.

575
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:27,550
This is what's impairing the rivers.

576
01:10:27,970 --> 01:10:36,760
Okay. And it impairs them in terms of aquatic life support fish and drinking water in context.

577
01:10:38,270 --> 01:10:46,030
Yeah. As to what siltation is, siltation is particles that are suspended in the water that makes it look murky.

578
01:10:46,540 --> 01:10:50,730
And then oxygen doesn't light, sunlight does not reach down below.

579
01:10:50,740 --> 01:10:54,640
So you don't have photosynthesis. And then it's kind of like muddy water.

580
01:10:55,090 --> 01:10:58,870
Any plants that are on there and they they don't look okay.

581
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:05,740
The other thing that's really important here is these are the designated uses of water.

582
01:11:06,220 --> 01:11:11,620
Okay. And there are indicators that correlate to each of those designated uses.

583
01:11:13,540 --> 01:11:18,580
So in your environmental assessment, you're going to need to be concerned about these different designated uses.

584
01:11:28,340 --> 01:11:34,370
Okay. Moving along. Turning away from rivers and streams to lakes and reservoirs and ponds.

585
01:11:35,270 --> 01:11:40,940
We have about 42 million acres of lakes, reservoirs and ponds.

586
01:11:41,780 --> 01:11:47,600
About a third of them were assessed. About 45% of those assessed were impaired.

587
01:11:48,920 --> 01:12:00,800
Yeah. Is the proportion of lakes, reservoirs and ponds higher to be assessed than the rivers because of accessibility to measure them?

588
01:12:02,750 --> 01:12:06,049
Good question. I can't answer.

589
01:12:06,050 --> 01:12:09,890
I'm not sure. I think that that's part of it.

590
01:12:10,910 --> 01:12:18,440
You know, some of the streams are probably hard to get to and that might be another part of it, but I'm not sure exactly what.

591
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:37,550
Designated uses are the same, but the impairment here is higher in terms of fair and poor and similar categories.

592
01:12:38,490 --> 01:12:44,870
It's more or less proportional. And what's causing the impact here?

593
01:12:45,590 --> 01:12:53,210
It's a little bit different. It's not so much. The situation is not number one, but nutrients in metals are number one and two,

594
01:12:53,690 --> 01:13:00,830
followed by filtration and then oxygen depleting substances, solids and plants and algal growth.

595
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:12,640
Now Great Lakes is different. Okay. And this is quite remarkable.

596
01:13:13,150 --> 01:13:24,040
In the Great Lakes, of course, we have the same sorts of designated uses, but we have aquatic life support with comparable percentages of fare.

597
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:34,570
But the big difference is in terms of fish consumption, because we have large numbers that are fair or poor compared to rivers and streams and lakes.

598
01:13:34,990 --> 01:13:39,940
And then all of these uses, almost 100%, is considered to be good.

599
01:13:41,480 --> 01:13:47,140
And what's impairing fish consumption in the Great Lakes?

600
01:13:51,730 --> 01:13:56,300
What's the problem? And I'm sorry, is that part of it?

601
01:13:56,320 --> 01:14:00,610
The things we're talking about are not so much.

602
01:14:01,150 --> 01:14:04,330
The fish kills. Not so much. It's toxics.

603
01:14:05,260 --> 01:14:10,090
Okay. Toxic chemicals, PCBs and mercury, primarily.

604
01:14:10,990 --> 01:14:19,660
Okay. And we have some other chemicals, but the nutrients, it's much less of a problem overall in the Great Lakes.

605
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:29,670
Okay. The Great Lakes is completely different. In the source is also completely different.

606
01:14:30,540 --> 01:14:37,590
It's in large part atmospheric deposition, and it's about comparable to, you know,

607
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:48,140
discharges from pipes and cans and then also contaminates sediments, which is also a problem in other situations, but not like in the Great Lakes.

608
01:14:48,390 --> 01:14:53,460
Okay. The Great Lakes is really quite different from all the other water bodies.

609
01:14:56,160 --> 01:15:03,530
What this means with these impaired uses is that states implement fish and wildlife consumption advisories.

610
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:08,010
Uh, this is showing you how many advisories there have been.

611
01:15:08,580 --> 01:15:13,049
Again, this is old data, but the trend sort of continues.

612
01:15:13,050 --> 01:15:18,780
And we have a lot of advisories due to fish consumption in these northern lakes.

613
01:15:23,810 --> 01:15:28,790
Okay. So yeah, I know how impressionable a couple five year old.

614
01:15:29,870 --> 01:15:34,850
Q Do you at an example of what the discontinued discharges from pipes is?

615
01:15:36,770 --> 01:15:39,770
Yeah, this is actually a problem.

616
01:15:39,770 --> 01:15:46,940
You have factories that are shut down, but there's still underground storage tanks and pipes and they continue to ooze out.

617
01:15:48,740 --> 01:15:55,130
Okay. So how come that isn't like if they're shut down, how they've been properly doing so?

618
01:15:55,160 --> 01:15:58,740
Wouldn't that be incomplete of their disassembling?

619
01:15:58,850 --> 01:16:02,270
You got it. It's what's called an orphan situation.

620
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:08,120
We don't even know who owns it at this point. Well, the the former company.

621
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:12,680
Well, yeah, but that may be back in 50 years ago.

622
01:16:14,450 --> 01:16:20,870
Right. But the jurisdiction still remains to be their property that they've neglected.

623
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:28,370
I agree. Only liable. So when the EPA forced them to fix this, that entity may be long gone.

624
01:16:29,750 --> 01:16:34,370
So if they around, yes, it would be their responsibility.

625
01:16:34,370 --> 01:16:42,440
But if they're, you know, gone with this and who we cleaned it up, what agency of the government would clean it up?

626
01:16:42,710 --> 01:16:48,290
Yeah, that's a great question. States should have some sort of reserve fund to do that.

627
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:53,090
This is a problem which is also affecting groundwater.

628
01:16:54,440 --> 01:17:04,340
And over the years, we've had millions of wells drilled because everybody was interested in oil and gas extraction.

629
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:10,850
Many of them were dry. And in the old days, you just move on, go to another site.

630
01:17:11,720 --> 01:17:15,050
Okay. And those wells are known as orphan wells also.

631
01:17:15,890 --> 01:17:24,200
And that's really bad because they allow contamination to move up and down the subsurface, which, you know, it's normally horizontally layered.

632
01:17:24,950 --> 01:17:30,980
And again, states usually have some sort of program to find these things and plug them with concrete.

633
01:17:32,870 --> 01:17:37,580
I think in Michigan, they're still probably finding about 100 a year, maybe a bit less.

634
01:17:39,130 --> 01:17:44,710
Okay. Good question for these all discharges.

635
01:17:45,370 --> 01:17:54,340
I mean, it's you know, it's an old industrial area. You'd be amazed when you dig what you found this estimate of.

636
01:17:58,510 --> 01:18:09,330
There was harassment. My boss.

637
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:21,010
Discontinue discharges. Yeah, that seems really large to me. I agree.

638
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:26,010
So. Okay.

639
01:18:27,050 --> 01:18:30,830
So that's been cleaned up. But there are paper mills that closed down.

640
01:18:31,310 --> 01:18:37,820
But now it has pieces. But I think the companies that are actually paying for this is like three or four companies.

641
01:18:39,850 --> 01:18:44,980
So maybe I don't know much about in the case of Kalamazoo River.

642
01:18:45,010 --> 01:18:53,740
It's pretty well documented because it is a Superfund site and they did a massive remedial investigation, feasibility study to look at this.

643
01:18:54,310 --> 01:19:06,700
And in my to my understanding, it is the discharges from former lagoons and waste disposal ponds, not so much pipe discharges.

644
01:19:07,300 --> 01:19:12,010
Okay. So again, here we're looking at the Great Lakes.

645
01:19:12,460 --> 01:19:18,430
There were probably in the old days, hundreds of pipes leading into or thousands of pipes leading into the Great Lakes.

646
01:19:20,470 --> 01:19:30,220
Good question. Yeah, this is probably I'm just curious, is this Michigan and Lake Huron and maybe not even Lake Huron,

647
01:19:30,220 --> 01:19:37,510
but I feel like Lake Michigan might be more like assaulted in terms of these pipes versus compared to like Lake Superior.

648
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:45,550
And maybe this is been I just think of Lake Michigan as being like a ton of those around.

649
01:19:46,120 --> 01:19:52,030
Yeah. I mean, definitely, you know, if you drive to Chicago, you can see a very intense development all around the southern part of the lake.

650
01:19:52,870 --> 01:20:00,429
Lake Superior. Yeah, it's probably true. It has much, much larger mining facilities and things like this that do discharge metals.

651
01:20:00,430 --> 01:20:03,550
And that's an issue for for that region.

652
01:20:04,120 --> 01:20:07,510
Yeah. Okay.

653
01:20:07,810 --> 01:20:11,230
So, you know, these kinds of problems have been recognized for a long time.

654
01:20:12,150 --> 01:20:17,170
Here's a chronology of some of the federal water quality legislation dating back to 1898.

655
01:20:17,890 --> 01:20:30,550
Um, you know, we had a number of different laws that were designed with good intentions but maybe didn't really match the, the needs.

656
01:20:30,580 --> 01:20:39,250
And in the sixties, we had situations like the Coyote Hoga River catching on fire and burning because

657
01:20:39,250 --> 01:20:45,880
of discharges of organics and fuels and stuff that would just float on the water.

658
01:20:47,470 --> 01:20:54,280
These kinds of, you know, highly publicized events did spur new legislation.

659
01:20:55,570 --> 01:21:03,490
1972 was really the modern era, I guess commenced with water pollution control.

660
01:21:04,430 --> 01:21:11,050
And it is the legislation that provided those designated uses that I talked about.

661
01:21:11,060 --> 01:21:15,940
Fishable and swimmable goals were part of the legislation.

662
01:21:16,270 --> 01:21:24,570
It included the use of standards, a listing of impaired waters, and its concept of total maximum daily loads and clearing.

663
01:21:24,730 --> 01:21:34,300
And this term deal system was what really boosted the control of nitrogen and phosphorus and other ways,

664
01:21:34,690 --> 01:21:40,150
because the idea was to keep the river or the stream swimmable fishable.

665
01:21:40,240 --> 01:21:51,399
So forth. And okay, we wanted there to be enough oxygen in in there to maintain high quality additional legislation.

666
01:21:51,400 --> 01:22:03,310
Of course, um, you know, important is the Drinking Water Act and the Pollution Control Act and these have been amended here as well.

667
01:22:03,910 --> 01:22:07,690
And we're probably still pretty far behind the times.

668
01:22:08,140 --> 01:22:21,220
But, you know, EPA and the states have increased their attention to things like guidelines and so forth for standards for chemicals, rather.

669
01:22:21,430 --> 01:22:32,919
And, um, I think we're behind the times because there are issues about protecting the resources that we have which aren't fully meeting the goal.

670
01:22:32,920 --> 01:22:39,760
And we'll talk more about that with watershed protection and things like this is a very challenging environment to work in.

671
01:22:40,690 --> 01:22:49,300
Nevertheless, we do have these key laws, and so we'll talk about some of the standards from them today and next week.

672
01:22:52,540 --> 01:22:56,979
Okay. So this is the first introduction to an environmental standard in the course, right?

673
01:22:56,980 --> 01:23:02,980
And that's important of the standard in the U.S. is a legal regulation and for contaminants,

674
01:23:02,980 --> 01:23:08,380
it limits the concentration of a contaminant to a specific level.

675
01:23:09,910 --> 01:23:19,900
We have various types of standards. We have effluent standards, things that are being discharged from facilities into navigable waters.

676
01:23:20,740 --> 01:23:29,590
Navigable is controversial. The Supreme Court this year greatly limited EPA's authority in here.

677
01:23:29,590 --> 01:23:36,610
But in event I'm not going to get into those details, but these effluent standards must consider toxicity,

678
01:23:36,610 --> 01:23:41,410
environmental persistence, impact on organisms and other aspects.

679
01:23:41,890 --> 01:23:49,660
And as an example, we have a national system called National Pollution Discharge Elimination System or fifties,

680
01:23:50,230 --> 01:23:55,600
and you need a permit to discharge into a navigable water.

681
01:23:56,050 --> 01:24:06,250
And that permit has to meet a number of conditions related to toxicity and so forth, and often to the concept of total maximum daily loads.

682
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:19,990
Okay. The idea of MDL is that you're not the only person discharging onto this waterway and collectively all of you should not push the.

683
01:24:20,050 --> 01:24:25,600
System into a condition where we have algal blooms, where the oxygen level goes too low.

684
01:24:26,740 --> 01:24:31,720
Okay. So it's kind of a system or regional approach to ensure water quality.

685
01:24:35,700 --> 01:24:45,959
F1 standards. Also, in addition to having discharge limits on sources, they may require monitoring, inspection, reporting as well.

686
01:24:45,960 --> 01:24:49,890
So it's not just a paper system, it's enforceable. Okay.

687
01:24:55,190 --> 01:24:58,760
Second type of standard is an ambient standard.

688
01:24:59,120 --> 01:25:06,830
It's a maximum concentration, sometimes a minimum in the case of oxygen that's measured in the water body.

689
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:18,830
Okay. And so this is set typically is close to the MCO, the maximum contaminant levels that are part of the drinking water standards.

690
01:25:19,490 --> 01:25:22,700
So we want you to be able to drink the water in history.

691
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:28,040
Okay. That's the goal. So we have MCO.

692
01:25:30,140 --> 01:25:35,150
We have MCO. Geez, I'll talk about those later. Those are maximum containment level goals.

693
01:25:36,050 --> 01:25:45,950
Okay. We have in other cases, we don't specify an MCO, but we specify a treatment technique.

694
01:25:46,520 --> 01:25:57,680
And for example, for giardia, a parasite or for viruses, we might say you have to remove 99.99% of the okay from your drinking water.

695
01:25:58,010 --> 01:26:02,390
We don't actually say the maximum number of giardia spores that you find.

696
01:26:03,110 --> 01:26:09,020
We're Krypto spores. And then we also have state designated uses.

697
01:26:09,410 --> 01:26:14,330
Again, those designated uses that I talked about can have different indicators.

698
01:26:16,900 --> 01:26:26,650
The Clean Water Act itself, excuse me, regulates so-called conventional balloons, things like body coliforms,

699
01:26:27,160 --> 01:26:34,870
toxic chemicals, and then unconventional or non-conventional chemicals, things that have not been previously classified.

700
01:26:35,590 --> 01:26:48,380
Starting to get complicated. Okay. I do want to say again that these standards are legal requirements.

701
01:26:49,190 --> 01:26:52,280
Okay. So they're not voluntary. They're not optional.

702
01:26:53,210 --> 01:27:01,490
They're a legal requirement. And this differs from systems in other parts of the world.

703
01:27:03,260 --> 01:27:10,220
Yeah. So the Clean Water Act is a type of ambient standard.

704
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:18,890
The Clean Water Act has a provision for these standards, which, for the most part are implemented by the states.

705
01:27:18,950 --> 01:27:25,790
And we'll talk about that. Okay. Okay. And most of the states adopt more or less similar levels.

706
01:27:26,490 --> 01:27:41,390
Okay. So the water quality criteria in terms of seals and sealed use depend on the designated use.

707
01:27:43,040 --> 01:27:50,270
And many times in particular for carcinogens, where we want the contaminant level to be is zero.

708
01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:55,910
The idea is that there's no safe level. Okay.

709
01:27:57,740 --> 01:28:08,480
But because this is infeasible to achieve, typically we may use a risk based approach and set a level which is low but not zero.

710
01:28:09,770 --> 01:28:12,830
Otherwise we'd have nobody complying. States would go crazy.

711
01:28:13,400 --> 01:28:28,260
It's a practical approach. If you can set it to zero, then use of MCO and this does take into account cost.

712
01:28:29,320 --> 01:28:39,840
Okay. So it's kind of a balance between the adverse outcome and the ability to actually treat the water for drinking water.

713
01:28:41,580 --> 01:28:54,200
Meals are enforceable. And you can if you're the water provider, for example, you need to keep your levels below meals.

714
01:28:59,370 --> 01:29:02,430
There are many other criteria.

715
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:09,100
Want to introduce some of these. These are largely risk based.

716
01:29:11,650 --> 01:29:20,320
There is the idea of a reference dose, and this is an amount of chemical that you can take typically on a daily level

717
01:29:20,740 --> 01:29:27,220
that will not cause a significant risk of adverse effects during a lifetime.

718
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:33,890
So for carcinogens, okay.

719
01:29:34,490 --> 01:29:44,330
That don't have it MCL. Typically the reference dose corresponds to an amount that is predicted to

720
01:29:44,330 --> 01:29:51,800
cause one in 100,000 or one in a million chance of a tumor over your lifetime.

721
01:29:53,560 --> 01:30:08,940
Okay. So that's where this risk base comes into effect, because the idea is with drinking two liters of water a day, you live 70 years.

722
01:30:09,330 --> 01:30:15,270
These standardized exposure assumptions. The risk is de minimis, small.

723
01:30:17,390 --> 01:30:35,000
Okay. Now there are secondary guidelines which aren't enforceable for cosmetic effects can be taste and odor and color and then quite controversial.

724
01:30:35,720 --> 01:30:43,610
There are also things that happen like flooding or a breach of a pipe or something like that,

725
01:30:44,060 --> 01:30:47,780
which may temporarily lead to higher concentration levels.

726
01:30:48,320 --> 01:30:54,350
And so we have these health advisory levels and these are, again, chemical specific.

727
01:30:55,130 --> 01:31:02,870
There are 110 and lifetime each. And I will show you a few of these.

728
01:31:05,750 --> 01:31:09,650
So, for example, just at the top, we have Bromo, chloro methane.

729
01:31:09,680 --> 01:31:14,170
Does anybody know about this chemical? No.

730
01:31:15,510 --> 01:31:18,840
All right. It's got a final health advisory.

731
01:31:19,290 --> 01:31:23,970
Otherwise, it doesn't have an MCO. And is Bromo Dichloromethane?

732
01:31:24,660 --> 01:31:29,250
Almost the same. It's got an MCO of 0.0 weight.

733
01:31:29,910 --> 01:31:33,600
It's also got a one below next to it.

734
01:31:34,470 --> 01:31:37,510
This is one of the chlorine disinfection byproducts.

735
01:31:38,220 --> 01:31:41,970
So we disinfect water by adding chlorine. Okay.

736
01:31:41,970 --> 01:31:50,490
That inactivates viruses and bacteria. But if you have few mixed substances, some organic matter in the water, which almost always do,

737
01:31:51,090 --> 01:31:58,559
it will react and form these treehugger methods chloroform, bromo, dichloromethane, bromo methane.

738
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:03,960
And from these four different chemicals.

739
01:32:04,770 --> 01:32:09,450
And collectively, the concentration of those has to be less than point oh.

740
01:32:09,450 --> 01:32:17,880
We know grams per liter. That level relates back to a risk which we think is acceptable.

741
01:32:18,780 --> 01:32:31,120
Okay. It's a bladder cancer control. On the other hand, the MCO G for Bromo Dichloromethane is zero.

742
01:32:31,900 --> 01:32:35,140
We'd like it to be zero. All right.

743
01:32:35,320 --> 01:32:38,710
But you won't be penalized. And it's legal to have it up to 2.0.

744
01:32:41,080 --> 01:32:45,760
This is an interesting chemical because this is in part the reason why systems have moved away

745
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:51,950
from chlorine to chlorine means an oscillation because they produce less of these trouble methane.

746
01:32:52,600 --> 01:32:57,220
But you can see this trade off. Okay. Questions about that?

747
01:32:58,840 --> 01:33:03,340
Yeah. Is there another standard that's related to the action level?

748
01:33:04,660 --> 01:33:11,440
Yeah, that is for Lynn, if that's what I'm thinking about.

749
01:33:11,650 --> 01:33:15,750
Yeah. Yeah, that's where I heard it. Okay. Yeah. So we have action level.

750
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:25,000
If the lead level goes above 15, then you have a lead exceedance under the lead and copper rule.

751
01:33:25,300 --> 01:33:28,600
But that is not an MCO or an MHCLG.

752
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:32,500
It's just part of the lead and copper rule, which is another standard.

753
01:33:32,650 --> 01:33:41,410
We're really it's a rule which is separate from this. So their terms are very complicated if you look at something simpler.

754
01:33:42,090 --> 01:33:49,280
Oh, I don't know. There's nothing simple on this one.

755
01:33:49,290 --> 01:33:55,490
We picked a hard one. Okay.

756
01:33:55,500 --> 01:33:58,830
Then on the right side of this table, we have the health advisory levels.

757
01:33:59,310 --> 01:34:04,890
And again, these are levels that are not to be exceeded for more than a day or ten days.

758
01:34:05,340 --> 01:34:09,540
And so even the Bromo Dichloromethane point.

759
01:34:09,540 --> 01:34:15,880
Oh, wait, for a short period of time, we let it go up to one, maybe even a little bit.

760
01:34:15,900 --> 01:34:19,350
Well, that's about the limit. So about 12 times higher.

761
01:34:27,300 --> 01:34:38,760
This list can have draft and final standards and health advisory levels denoted by a or this and so

762
01:34:38,760 --> 01:34:46,170
this really then also for many of these chemicals needs to couple into EPA's cancer classification.

763
01:34:46,740 --> 01:34:59,490
This has evolved over the years, but basically it's weight of evidence judgment about whether a chemical in fact is likely to cause cancer to humans,

764
01:35:00,030 --> 01:35:05,489
whether it is known to be carcinogenic or not carcinogenic.

765
01:35:05,490 --> 01:35:12,750
And so there are different classifications. Yeah, I think the question is.

766
01:35:13,770 --> 01:35:18,270
Yeah. Accumulated or per day occurrence.

767
01:35:18,280 --> 01:35:21,100
You should have. No, this is per day. Okay.

768
01:35:21,190 --> 01:35:31,960
So the assumption in all of these is that you can drink two liters of water at these levels with not much chance of adverse outcomes.

769
01:35:45,160 --> 01:35:54,250
And the last column on this table, it gives you the cancer description,

770
01:35:54,700 --> 01:36:02,290
the URL and so forth, which relates back to the ones in the EPA cancer guidelines.

771
01:36:06,610 --> 01:36:10,600
Okay. Turning away from chemicals to microbial contaminants.

772
01:36:11,080 --> 01:36:14,530
The approach is different. We don't regulate these quantitatively.

773
01:36:14,770 --> 01:36:16,870
Instead, we use a treatment technology.

774
01:36:17,320 --> 01:36:29,620
And so, for example, for cryptosporidium, the idea is that we have to remove through some sort of filter 99% of the process,

775
01:36:29,620 --> 01:36:38,530
the the sort of inactive form of cryptosporidium that can survive going through a treatment plant but still causing great distress.

776
01:36:38,840 --> 01:36:51,250
Okay. If you ingested MCO GS, for example, or zero for Legionella, but again you will use a treatment technology to try to reduce it.

777
01:36:53,140 --> 01:36:56,360
Is this a good system? Again, it's practical.

778
01:36:56,380 --> 01:37:09,610
It considers course. And so it is we're pretty well we have relatively few examples of outbreaks, but we certainly do have some.

779
01:37:10,540 --> 01:37:20,020
Okay. I mean, regionally, there was a I believe, a crypto outbreak in Hamilton Cross in Canada.

780
01:37:21,220 --> 01:37:32,170
There have been some in Michigan in recent years as well. Same for viruses at the bottom, 99.99% killed or inactivated.

781
01:37:34,540 --> 01:37:38,020
Questions on treatment technology. Yeah.

782
01:37:38,680 --> 01:37:42,220
These are all good. What we don't see is saltwater protection.

783
01:37:43,270 --> 01:37:46,410
Okay, so this is an issue that I have. Okay.

784
01:37:46,420 --> 01:37:53,980
Moving to aquatic life. There are standards as well.

785
01:37:54,040 --> 01:37:59,649
There are acute maximum standards. These are short term. And then we have chronic standards.

786
01:37:59,650 --> 01:38:05,860
These are long term. And you can see, again, the acute can be higher than the chronic.

787
01:38:06,460 --> 01:38:09,280
The assumption is that this is relatively short term.

788
01:38:09,820 --> 01:38:19,810
And I've listed here some metals and pesticides and some other chemicals that have both acute and chronic values.

789
01:38:22,390 --> 01:38:29,650
Okay. There are other standards, and the one that's prominent and missing from here is dealing with oxygen.

790
01:38:29,920 --> 01:38:36,810
And we'll talk about that next week. Okay.

791
01:38:37,200 --> 01:38:41,220
The other piece was this notion of total maximum daily loads.

792
01:38:41,880 --> 01:38:51,120
And this is where there's a sort of systems approach to understanding that a number of different facilities may affect the same watershed.

793
01:38:51,480 --> 01:38:57,930
And the idea with the model is to stay within what we call the assumptive capacity.

794
01:38:58,380 --> 01:39:09,480
In other words, the ability of that watershed to handle the waste or chemicals and not cause adverse health effects or ecological effects.

795
01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:15,840
And we use water quality models in terms of the waste load allocation and the policy development.

796
01:39:16,770 --> 01:39:21,140
The three steps are listed here. What's the symbols of capacity?

797
01:39:21,150 --> 01:39:24,060
In other words, how many tonnes per day can be handled?

798
01:39:24,790 --> 01:39:35,910
Determine the maximum discharges, bless you among the different sources and then apportion the sources, including point and on point sources.

799
01:39:39,870 --> 01:39:40,169
To me,

800
01:39:40,170 --> 01:39:50,340
this is a very interesting application of models because you sort of are saying you can pollute up to a level which doesn't cause adverse impacts.

801
01:39:51,420 --> 01:40:00,450
Okay. And again, it's for cost benefit or economic factors come into the decision.

802
01:40:02,030 --> 01:40:06,030
And so it's not attempting to bring things down to zero at all.

803
01:40:06,930 --> 01:40:12,630
It's attempting to live within these constraints. So it makes sense?

804
01:40:13,290 --> 01:40:20,550
Yeah, it does. I was just wondering if there's several facilities or several discharges.

805
01:40:21,330 --> 01:40:26,100
How do they divide up like that? Yeah, that's that's a fantastic question.

806
01:40:26,100 --> 01:40:31,440
And I'll give you some examples later. And it's not always clear.

807
01:40:32,190 --> 01:40:41,550
Okay. And you may be having one community competing against another community or industry competing against another industry.

808
01:40:42,150 --> 01:40:46,950
So models are the common denominator here.

809
01:40:47,460 --> 01:40:51,750
Okay. And then there's a degree of negotiation that takes place as well.

810
01:40:52,170 --> 01:40:55,980
But it's certainly not a perfect system. And that's a great question.

811
01:40:56,010 --> 01:41:00,720
We'll get into that. And in fact, I'll demonstrate a spreadsheet model for you.

812
01:41:01,200 --> 01:41:04,410
I don't think I'm giving it to you as a homework. I'll just demonstrate.

813
01:41:07,800 --> 01:41:16,530
Okay. This is kind of an optional piece here, but these models have been used for almost 100 years,

814
01:41:17,160 --> 01:41:29,280
and the evolution of these models has been moving into multimedia, multi chemicals and all kinds of interactions and things like that.

815
01:41:29,550 --> 01:41:34,650
And at this point, we use what we call integrated assessment models.

816
01:41:34,660 --> 01:41:38,690
So we're typically looking at multiple stressors on a water body.

817
01:41:38,700 --> 01:41:47,760
So we're looking at interactions between chemicals, bacteria that may be growing, eutrophication, oxygen and so forth.

818
01:41:52,830 --> 01:42:04,940
These models can be applied to different situations and the typical applications are listed here with mixing zone.

819
01:42:04,950 --> 01:42:09,300
This is very close to a discharge along a river.

820
01:42:09,780 --> 01:42:18,000
Obviously a one dimensional system or multi-dimensional system, accounting for dilution, degradation, so forth.

821
01:42:18,480 --> 01:42:21,870
In lakes, estuaries, oceans, there are runoff models.

822
01:42:22,380 --> 01:42:29,790
There are separate models for temperature and erosion and sedimentation, groundwater we'll look at next month.

823
01:42:30,810 --> 01:42:36,030
And, you know, water distribution systems and wastewater in this class.

824
01:42:36,030 --> 01:42:47,880
We'll look at just a couple of these models just in a more or less conceptual manner and some of the EPA models.

825
01:42:51,620 --> 01:42:55,220
Okay. In the video that you watched,

826
01:42:55,700 --> 01:43:04,580
I talked a little bit about model formulation and selection and the questions that I like to think about are listed here.

827
01:43:05,090 --> 01:43:09,580
What do you need to assume in your model? What do you need to incorporate?

828
01:43:10,870 --> 01:43:16,200
You know, is your model dealing with dilution dispersion reaction?

829
01:43:16,220 --> 01:43:20,360
We need to figure this out. Is it steady state or dynamic?

830
01:43:21,950 --> 01:43:25,370
What are the governing equations? What are the mixing assumptions?

831
01:43:25,970 --> 01:43:30,080
What's the dimensionality of the model? This is all kind of theoretical.

832
01:43:30,500 --> 01:43:37,430
Typically, when you get to a specific application, you're dealing with, you know, the stream or river or a coastal system.

833
01:43:37,760 --> 01:43:45,260
This may dictate the dimensionality of your model. The types of discharges that you have is important.

834
01:43:45,260 --> 01:43:48,840
When there's a point line area or volume. We'll talk a little bit about those.

835
01:43:49,700 --> 01:43:57,770
And then the data that you have to calibrate to test the model with a sensitivity analysis and evaluate the results.

836
01:43:58,250 --> 01:43:59,120
This is all important.

837
01:43:59,750 --> 01:44:07,940
The point really of this slide is you just can't dump all your input parameters into some model without thinking about these things.

838
01:44:08,360 --> 01:44:13,550
You need to have a match between the application, you know, and and the model that you're using.

839
01:44:21,990 --> 01:44:25,200
This is actually a good point to stop. Okay.

840
01:44:25,230 --> 01:44:27,690
We've gone through a lot of different applications.

841
01:44:28,180 --> 01:44:37,980
Then what I will do next week is to build these up in a sequence that gets more complicated, more realistic.

842
01:44:38,640 --> 01:44:43,290
Okay. I think it makes sense to do that all in one unit.

843
01:44:44,850 --> 01:44:49,650
A couple of other things. Just in terms of business, since I have a minute or two.

844
01:44:50,970 --> 01:44:55,260
October 24th, I think is when a homework is due.

845
01:44:55,890 --> 01:44:59,490
Okay. And I want to make sure that you have at least three weeks to work on it.

846
01:44:59,940 --> 01:45:03,540
So I will be working on providing a homework to you.

847
01:45:03,870 --> 01:45:09,930
And I think we agreed to do teams. So I am going to try to divide you up.

848
01:45:10,320 --> 01:45:15,090
I may need a little more information to match you guys.

849
01:45:15,480 --> 01:45:20,550
So if you do get a survey, I have to figure it out. If I do or not need more information.

850
01:45:20,850 --> 01:45:25,890
If I do, I need more information. I will give you a little survey, so please do that promptly.

851
01:45:26,640 --> 01:45:30,690
Okay. Because I can match you guys up into teams until I get to that.

852
01:45:31,600 --> 01:45:37,590
Okay. So the idea, the goal to get out this homework this week and then it would be do the 24th,

853
01:45:38,040 --> 01:45:41,730
the week before, we'll have an opportunity to discuss any questions.

854
01:45:42,060 --> 01:45:45,690
It will focus on the Kalamazoo River year.

855
01:45:45,930 --> 01:45:49,600
So you can start taking a look at that. Good.

856
01:45:51,730 --> 01:45:55,630
Okay. All right. Well, have a good week.

857
01:45:57,490 --> 01:45:57,970
Thank you.
