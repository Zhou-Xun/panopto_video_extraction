1
00:00:27,740 --> 00:02:01,880
Last year. I team Cola.

2
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:09,070
What are you doing, OK? You can hear me, I can hear you.

3
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:17,000
OK. Yes, I am in the hotel in peace.

4
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,160
All right, fantastic. Hey, I'm working out some technical difficulties.

5
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:40,730
Yeah, go ahead. Go here. Come on. Give me like 30 seconds.

6
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:48,830
Uh, let's see, the sound is there. Yeah, I guess it's all right, right?

7
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:56,630
Beyoncé, you're not and you're the only one. Yeah, exactly.

8
00:02:56,630 --> 00:03:04,030
But that's that's my high tech solution. That I will not repeat.

9
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:07,880
Uh, it's actually these speakers that are failing us.

10
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:14,190
And if they were, we would be all set. We can't talk you into that and have that be the speaker.

11
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:31,480
Kind of stress things off so I can make. I'll come around.

12
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:36,670
Nikola, you can see me or hear me. Yes. Yes, I guess you all right.

13
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:44,650
Hi. And here we are. I guess you all welcome to our classroom.

14
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:53,260
Thank you. I have to. I had the pleasure last week, actually to give the class a little bit of an introduction of you.

15
00:03:53,260 --> 00:04:02,680
So if you all remember, Professor Peron is in addition to be an adjunct faculty member here at the School of Public Health.

16
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:15,280
For the last 25 years, Nikola has been a research director and also actually a head of the institute for many of the years,

17
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:23,980
and I spent a large amount of time studying Mercury and then in the more recent years has been

18
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:31,390
doing work very actively to inform the policy around Mercury and the Mini-Mart Convention.

19
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:34,930
And so with that, Nikola, thank you so much for joining us.

20
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:40,060
The floor is yours, actually. Let me make you a co-host so you can share your screen.

21
00:04:40,060 --> 00:05:07,850
Yes. Let me try. He should be OK.

22
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:19,260
Or quit over. So can you see it?

23
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:23,880
Yes. Yup. Looks great. Thank you. That's really good.

24
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:29,250
So thank you to everyone.

25
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:39,450
It's a pleasure for me today to go to talk about the Minamata Convention and do something more about the Mini-Mart.

26
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:54,660
And the goal of the this lecture is really to give you an overview of all the Minamata Convention start rolling the ball about 20 years ago now.

27
00:05:54,660 --> 00:06:05,110
And so it's as you know, last week they just finished the COP 4.2, the second segment in person in Bali, in Indonesia.

28
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:13,860
Unfortunately, I was not there, but this has been quite successful the confidence of the party.

29
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:24,660
So what I'm going to to do today is this is about line of the lecture today, so I will introduce you about the mercury cycle.

30
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:29,910
But I'm I'm sure that you have been reading a lot about this already.

31
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:35,040
And then will introduce the key articles of the Minamata Convention.

32
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:40,590
I apologize sense now that sometimes when you talk about policy, it's quite boring.

33
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:45,510
So I will try to do my best to make things a little bit more fancy.

34
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:50,080
But then we'll talk about the negotiation process,

35
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:58,350
how we got to the point of the signature of the of this convention in 2013 and then

36
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:03,210
the role of science in the policy process and why we do research and what the

37
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:09,180
research is about and how this research outcome should be linked and how this

38
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:16,450
has been supporting the development of this treaty and the the implementation.

39
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:25,740
It is still ongoing process now and then specifically what type of tools the research has been developing to

40
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:33,600
support the evaluation of the effectiveness of this convention through the National Implementation Plan for

41
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:41,280
every country signing the convention has been undertaken a number of measures to match the convention target

42
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:49,470
and then what is the role of research programs so contributing programs to the Minamata Convention or not?

43
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:53,400
So let's start with the easiest part for the mercury cycle.

44
00:07:53,400 --> 00:08:03,750
Just to make sure that we we speak about this using the same language as general mercury is is the only method that at ambient

45
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:12,520
temperature is liquid and it has a lot of properties and is a natural element that is released to global environment,

46
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:19,860
to a number of processes that involve natural processes or anthropogenic processes.

47
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:29,160
As we know, natural processes can be emission from volcano emission from the ocean or topsoil.

48
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,950
But also then on top of this,

49
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:40,950
you have the the role of anthropogenic activity manmade emission from industrial activity that can be for energy consumption,

50
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:46,620
energy production and manufacturing processing as we see later.

51
00:08:46,620 --> 00:09:00,360
As soon as this mercury is released to the atmosphere primarily as elemental mercury, but also as attached to particles or in the Ofsted's form.

52
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:04,740
But more than 90 percent, this usually is elemental market.

53
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:14,580
Then as soon as this goes to the atmosphere, depending on the atmospheric composition and also the latitude of the emission,

54
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:18,570
these can can go through a number of chemical transformations.

55
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:28,410
Both physical and chemical transformation can be scavenged through precipitation processes like precipitation or snow,

56
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:34,110
and then can be deposited to terrestrial ecosystem.

57
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:42,390
That's going to be topsoil or ocean as soon as this goes into the ocean.

58
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:50,700
This can be, for example, mutilated ultimately through bacteria mediation so it can become a methylmercury.

59
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:55,740
And these methylmercury can can be, you know, goes to the food chain.

60
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:59,010
You know, as you can see here in the in the in the slide,

61
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:11,190
here it goes from first traffic level to up to the up to the food chain to back to human health through ingestion of a contaminated fish.

62
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:20,430
But not all these fish. This in process goes. For several days worth of food like, you know, rice or vegetables,

63
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:30,050
if you produce vegetables in the contaminated area and then a part of this mercury that grows in the ocean can be deposited.

64
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:37,070
Could it be fixed the in the sediment? So is a really it will cycle that.

65
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:45,060
Also, the top the emission from the ocean in the ocean can be a sink, but also a source of an ice cream.

66
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:55,080
It can be an important source because through photo reduction, mercury can be reduced to the one that is in the top.

67
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:58,460
Water makes early. It can be released to the atmosphere.

68
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:04,670
So that's why we have to cycle so you can have a deposition and then layer mission back to the US.

69
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:09,590
So it's it's like a catch 22. It's always up and down.

70
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:16,430
So the role of science is really to understand that these processes and what can

71
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:23,390
we do in order to reduce the impact of mercury accumulation in the food web?

72
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:30,710
And so ultimately impact on human health, but also wildlife as well.

73
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:32,480
So having said that,

74
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:43,910
what has been the progress made in the last 20 years in the first global macro assessment report was drafted was prepared in 2002.

75
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:56,900
So about 20 years ago, this was the first ever written report giving a global picture of of the mercury compared to the pre-industrial.

76
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:04,520
And as far as we know, we had the Industrial Revolution industrial development in the last couple hundred years,

77
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:13,490
but also the use of Medicaid goes way back then 200 years ago, so close to even five thousand years ago.

78
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:21,920
And then we have been estimating all the pieces of the mercury cycle, emissions from industrial sector,

79
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:34,460
emissions from natural sources and recycling to between natural compartment and exchange changing with the metrological and climate conditions.

80
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:38,660
Climate can affect a lot of the mercury cycle, as we know.

81
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:47,970
And then during the years, I will show you in the next coming slides, we have been doing several of these global mercury assessments,

82
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:55,940
so we've been following the sea finding these estimates based on the state of our knowledge,

83
00:12:55,940 --> 00:13:03,920
of our work knowledge from different single processes, including emission from different sectors.

84
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:10,250
And so when we compare to 2002 and the 2018 report,

85
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:15,320
we have seen that the role of a science because in 2002 we thought that the

86
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:22,670
estimated global mercury level was like three times the pre-industrial level.

87
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:33,350
But the later we have seen that use about six times higher compared to the pre-industrial level due to natural processes.

88
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:36,470
So this means that we know much better.

89
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:46,430
We have been learning on our single processes can affect the cycle of this mercury between different compartments.

90
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:52,100
But let's continue this. So this just give you an idea who does what?

91
00:13:52,100 --> 00:14:04,280
So as you can see, this is the 2018 estimate is the latest assessment that was reported in the GMI 2018 that is available online, of course.

92
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:10,760
And as you can see, about four percent of parents report.

93
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:16,460
Then it releases over. Mercury comes from artisanal and small scale gold mining.

94
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:24,710
As you know, Mercury is used to produce amalgam for the gold extraction gold production in a stream tracks.

95
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:36,050
But I will talk more about this later. Then it is. The second most important source of mercury is the stationary combustion full of coal using coal.

96
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:42,800
So fossil fuel combustion for for energy production, industrial production, manufacturing.

97
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:51,290
Then we have a non-ferrous metal production for either another 15 percent and then goes on to cement production 10 percent.

98
00:14:51,290 --> 00:15:02,420
And then we have waste from, you know, we have a lot of mercury waste as it is about six percent and so on through,

99
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:06,620
you know, waste incineration, we're going to waste a lot of production.

100
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:13,590
Now the Colorado, for example, has been phasing out the use of mercury, few in-situ.

101
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:15,520
Now, when we see the difference,

102
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:23,520
so we have a lot of mercury phased out from coal actually sector and the mercury is not the way it is, it is a commodity.

103
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:27,690
So this mercury must be stored somewhere.

104
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:38,760
And this is also another issue for policymakers where we can store the pot that much is being fished out from manufacturing process.

105
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:52,320
So right now, the global emission from anthropogenic sources is about 200 tons per year, which is a pretty important number.

106
00:15:52,320 --> 00:16:00,060
Although the natural contribution can be twice a year, but our our scope,

107
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:11,730
our goal through the minimum at the convention is to reduce the anthropogenic contribution in order to reduce the risk for population.

108
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:19,590
So what has been this is quite interesting. You have two slides on the policy process just to give you an idea.

109
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:25,260
As I said in 2002, we prepared the first global macro assessment piece.

110
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:37,110
This was was quite an incredible experience for me because I was part of the team that reviewed this report.

111
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:43,970
In 2002, we spent 10 days in Geneva discussing every single page of this report.

112
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:53,700
A lot of discussion, a lot of interest. Many stakeholders, a lot of all countries involved wasn't very interesting for a scientist like me.

113
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:57,120
I was 20 years younger at the time,

114
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:08,730
so it was quite interesting to see that the first experience really serious experience I did in terms of interaction between science and policy.

115
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:14,760
So I learned a lot why we do research and for the benefit of the society.

116
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:22,860
So after that, we serve a number of strategy at the European scale and global scale to make sure that all the

117
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:29,400
scientific community was involved in the policy process in order to provide the state of science,

118
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:35,130
state of the art knowledge on different aspects involving a motorcycle.

119
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:42,630
So after that, we have been producing quite a few technical report highlighting a different aspect,

120
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:52,860
and ABC GMA is being produced again in 2008 and then again in 2013 and then in 2017 18.

121
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:59,040
It has been the basis of the Cop three and then a cop for just two.

122
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:06,600
And then during this time, a lot of other experts group were supporting the policy process of several agency.

123
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:17,190
Intergovernmental Negotiation Committee have been working, for example, here in the in the five years 2009 to 2013.

124
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:22,650
We and through the 2017 we had seven agency.

125
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:32,880
We think, as you can see from the slides preparing the diplomatic conference was held in Kumamoto in 2013,

126
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,440
so the treaty was signed by over a hundred countries.

127
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:44,370
Then the the convention entered into force in August of 2017.

128
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:52,050
So five years ago, we did aim to have the first effectiveness evaluation of the convention after six years later.

129
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:58,950
So in 2015, we are asked to provide the the first effectiveness evaluation assessment.

130
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:05,640
And during these last five years, we had four different conferences of party,

131
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:13,020
as you will see starting in 2017 until the one that was just ended last week, as they said.

132
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:17,190
And this is part of the implementation process of the treaty.

133
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:28,480
So it's quite complex. A lot of interested parties involved not only national representative but also policy stakeholders and a number of NGO,

134
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:33,540
a lot of other international organizations involved.

135
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:37,440
So just to give you two weeks for you. The key dates.

136
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:46,710
So I have a decent life. Of course you can have it. And the key dates out of the one that the of the Conference of Parties, I said,

137
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:55,410
and to the two segments, you know, the Kobe unfortunately didn't allow us to the cop in November 2021.

138
00:19:55,410 --> 00:20:06,570
So we had the first segment was done online a few months ago and then this second segment has been done in Bali last week.

139
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:14,630
Today, the convention is being ratified by under 287 countries.

140
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:19,260
There are 41 focal points as of today.

141
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:27,570
And so it's quite successful global trade because there are global treaties.

142
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:36,060
For example, in Stockholm and so forth that started 50 years ago, the Stockholm Convention on Pubs, which is important.

143
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:46,500
So it's a long process, takes time, but especially when you deal with environmental issues and the countries should take action.

144
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:50,640
Also, investing money to achieve the goal because, you know,

145
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:58,620
is not to you cannot achieve the goals without investment and industrial sector and many other sectors.

146
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:02,040
So just to what is the basic the minimum?

147
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:15,330
The convention is addressed different pieces of the measurement cycle that involves the supply trade, as we will see later, the product processes GM,

148
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:27,200
as you mentioned before, and then also the production and the definition of the best available technology at best environmental practices guidance.

149
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:36,330
So on a mission just to reduce emissions, then we have also the production of emission inventory to estimate the releases of these

150
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:44,220
contaminants from different sources that can be manmade or natural driven processes.

151
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:48,030
Then the storage, as I said, one of the issues has been in storage.

152
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:52,830
This was the focus of the COP two three years ago.

153
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:59,520
And then, of course, we have some a guideline on the waste cycle.

154
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,810
So how to treat the waste contaminated with the mercury?

155
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:11,640
So this is the basis is the Basel Convention that is specifically focused on waste management,

156
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:22,920
the waste cycle and then another important during the COP three, we focused on reducing the guidance on the management of contaminated sites.

157
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:28,740
So that is one of the issues not quality for air if they are all contaminated sites,

158
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:33,760
but also industrial sites contaminated with the mercury and mercury dust.

159
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:42,450
The mobola, you know, is not is fixed to the topsoil and water and sediment.

160
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:54,240
And so it takes a lot of time the response time of ecosystem to to be restored by mercury contamination.

161
00:22:54,240 --> 00:23:03,180
It takes time, money investment, a lot of the involvement of technology for cleaning up the system and so on.

162
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:16,920
So this is just a snapshot of of different guidance that are supporting the implementation of the convention because during the last 20 years,

163
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:21,480
we have been producing associate the number of technical people,

164
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:30,140
old kids for emission inventory at the national scale and technical information on the best available technology.

165
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:37,150
So there is a lot of literature available for all interested.

166
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:47,700
If you are interested to have more details on specific points that you can, you can refer to.

167
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:55,830
And for example, Article eight of the convention is related the emission emission.

168
00:23:55,830 --> 00:24:05,880
Of course, you have to deal with the best available technique to lower emissions from industrial sector and also best environmental practices,

169
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:10,590
especially in the ACM artisanal and small scale gold mining.

170
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:23,010
The effort to during the last 10 15 years has been to teach the miners good practice to lower the risk for themselves and for the environment.

171
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:30,120
So when we talk about the control of emission or total, mostly from industrial plans for power plants,

172
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:35,310
industrial boiler smelting and roasting processes for non-ferrous metal

173
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:41,910
production from waste incineration facility cement clinker production facility.

174
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:50,010
So you can have all this guidance on the emission inventory and about the best available online.

175
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:58,470
So Buck is very useful to see also what industries the industrial sector has been doing in the last 20 years,

176
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:04,830
not only for marketing but also for other contaminants or transport used, for example, ppm and the most.

177
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:14,880
Over the yes, sir, contaminants as co-benefits, you have also reduction of mercury emission from industrial boilers,

178
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:23,250
industrial power plant and coal power plants and so on. So it's kind of a Win-Win strategy.

179
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:28,530
And then there is Article seven on artisanal small scale.

180
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:39,150
As I said, this is the first anthropogenic sources representing 30 to 40 percent of the total emission on an annual basis,

181
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:42,840
about eight hundred fifty times per year, more or less.

182
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:51,360
And this is continuously update because you can understand that we estimate emissions from the source of this time,

183
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:59,040
each up because each artisanal but processed so there is no way to trace back

184
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:05,310
the implementation of different strategy may change from a person to a person,

185
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:09,480
from a miner to another miner from his side to play another step.

186
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:13,740
So these estimates shouldn't be considered very carefully.

187
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:23,010
So it's not that these are not the numbers that I would put one one one dollar showed,

188
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:28,440
but it's it's the best of our knowledge, the best estimates that today we are able to do.

189
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:36,000
But as I will show you later, there are different initiatives project new technology,

190
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,820
including Earth observation that are used prudently to refine visas to me.

191
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:50,290
So to lower the uncertainty in the decision making process because of course, policymaker decision makers,

192
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:58,710
they are not scientists as they take a decision on the basis of a technical report recommendation

193
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:06,300
from the expert group that usually are scientific experts or technical experts of a certain sector.

194
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:12,960
So based on data outcome on this suggests policy makers decision makers take a decision.

195
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:22,510
So they take a decision, for example, in terms of investment in certain industrial sector compared to others and saw.

196
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:27,460
So why, you know, why Mercury is used in this?

197
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:32,890
It's easy, easy answer, because Mercury is easy to find.

198
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:44,320
You know, you can buy Mercury quite easily is a cheap compared to the profit that you can get from the use of mercury in gold production.

199
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:51,620
Is anybody can can use it. You don't need your massive degree to use mercury to do gold production.

200
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:59,320
You know, usually these people are people at the low level of the source of our society.

201
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:13,420
They do that for living, and usually they have the supplier of a mercury to the miner of the gold buyers

202
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:19,690
and to those that do the business with the gold produced by gold miners.

203
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:33,970
And very often we have seen that miners are not aware of the risk for this harm in using American and mercury is available.

204
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:37,330
Still, a lot of mining of fresh mercury is done.

205
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:40,780
Work what I will you chumps?

206
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:57,170
For example, this is an example over open SJM mine, where people take to the soil and then they work, didn't the commission?

207
00:28:57,170 --> 00:29:05,140
But this is the impact of the issue the destruction of habitat, deforestation and awesome protected area.

208
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:12,730
So it's it's it's illegal practice, but it's tolerated by countries, especially in countries where the income is very low.

209
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:16,900
So it's kind of a mediation. You know, people need to leave.

210
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:23,160
They need to buy food and they need a job. So in these places, you cannot.

211
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:30,850
You have to mediate. So you have to teach them the best practice, even using mercury that is forbidden by law,

212
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:37,750
but using mercury in a more rational way in order to reduce the risk for their health.

213
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:46,120
So each kind? Is there a Win-Win strategy? You know, you cannot have a perfection, but you have to get some outcome out of it.

214
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:52,150
So improvement. So the key word is to improve the situation, reduce the risk.

215
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:58,110
As you can see here from the slides, the way they work, the roasting process is, you know, they breed.

216
00:29:58,110 --> 00:30:06,970
This man is breeding, everything is released, all the mercury that is released from the amalgam during the roasting process.

217
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:14,830
You know, these women and men and a little child over there at the two meters distance, they all breed mercury.

218
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:18,910
So sooner or later, when they will be 35 40, they will.

219
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:30,210
They will start having the central nervous system disorder and all kind of health issues that he like is like Alzheimer.

220
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:35,940
All these huge effect on memory, on movement and so forth.

221
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:40,090
So but that's terrible. So that is what we need.

222
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:46,990
We need to reduce the risk associated to these practices that are wrong.

223
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:55,240
So right now, what is the production of rubella primarily from mining sector?

224
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:58,270
That was an estimate in 2020.

225
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:09,290
As you can see, China is number one and then followed by Mexico, Indonesia, Kyrgyzstan and Peru and other Latin American countries.

226
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:20,260
So right now, we produce about 2000 tons per year over gold of primarily mercury production globally.

227
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:26,200
And what are the fact that you use mostly the mercury that is produced?

228
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:36,730
So the two primary sector produce more than 50 percent of the global production of Mercury is GM and the PCM production.

229
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:46,060
This, as you can see, these are big numbers. And now the scope of the convention is to ensure that this number go down.

230
00:31:46,060 --> 00:32:00,520
We can reduce this now. The total amount of mercury used is about more than about five thousand tons per year.

231
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:08,590
And so this is a map showing the total mercury used by country for this jim sector.

232
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:11,140
And what is the estimated informal imports?

233
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:21,160
Because informal because, as I said, most countries this is in legal practice, including the mining, but they tolerate.

234
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:31,860
So you can see. The Indonesia, China, but also Latin America, including Bolivia, Peru and Ecuador.

235
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:40,920
Most of the Latin America, and they import a lot of most, if not produced locally.

236
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:47,740
So this is the issue right now. And so what are the negative effects?

237
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:56,140
Just to summarize, what are the most important, the negative effects on our exposure to the food sources or in additional fuels,

238
00:32:56,140 --> 00:33:01,480
as we have been showing for the roasting of amalgam worst practices,

239
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:06,100
warlord amalgamation process, open amalgam, burning, bottling,

240
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:16,150
amalgam and residentially is because they usually they do this where they leave all day when they use mixture of China and the mercury.

241
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:25,510
So that is so what are the vulnerable population group certainly are children and pregnant women.

242
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:34,630
But it's it's a feast for everyone. I'm probably not sure, but I mean, for everyone.

243
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:46,870
So manufacturing processes, as I said, the most important one, the quarterly production about needs will be phased out completely by 2025.

244
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:52,600
And also the phasing out of the use of Mercury in the production of this year.

245
00:33:52,600 --> 00:34:00,790
This was supposed to get accomplished in 2018, but still, you know,

246
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:08,020
not really there and that the same for Beachum monomer, production and other product.

247
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:13,330
That is a long list here, but then contaminated sites.

248
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:20,110
This is a big issue. There was a very interesting report that you can see your guidance on the

249
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:24,850
management of contaminated sites because this is related to industrial sites,

250
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:34,690
is jim sites and so on. So you've got three was approved this guidance document and this is now being implemented.

251
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:43,810
Consider it at the country level, international implementation plan doesn't help us better.

252
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:52,180
There are a number of aspects that we we need to chop, or we deal with that aspect due to the exposure.

253
00:34:52,180 --> 00:35:05,680
So countries are asked to promote the development and implementation of a strategy and program to identify and protect populations at risk.

254
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:15,610
Then also to promote the development and implementation of a science based educational and preventive programs on occupational exposure.

255
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:27,130
So we have to teach the people how to prevent and how to lower the exposure to mercury to inhalation and food contaminated food.

256
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:33,010
So you have to teach that because as I said, we don't deal with the people with the master degree.

257
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:39,070
We deal people that in the best-case scenario, they've done one or two years in elementary school.

258
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:45,880
No more than that. They don't they most of them are not even able to read correctly.

259
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:50,350
So to promote appropriate health care services for prevention,

260
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:57,730
treatment and care for population affected by exposure to Medicaid and then also country Alaska

261
00:35:57,730 --> 00:36:06,640
establishes trends as appropriate institutional and health professional capacity for the prevention,

262
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:13,080
the diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of health risks.

263
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:21,330
Then another important article of the convention started 22 on the effectiveness issue.

264
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:31,980
During the last few years, we've have been working to define key methodology on how to assess the effectiveness

265
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:37,090
of the measures undertaken by companies to achieve this target of the convention.

266
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:42,660
So the target of the convention is to reduce emissions to the global environment,

267
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:48,480
to reduce the exposure for population and the risk associated could be exposure.

268
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:57,690
So how we do this, there is the Article 19 or research development and the monitor that includes interim

269
00:36:57,690 --> 00:37:03,910
modeling assessment of the impact of mercury and mercury compound on the environment,

270
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:09,330
the human health and also the need to produce harmonized methodologies.

271
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:18,870
So we cannot we need to harmonize methodology both for sampling, modeling and evaluation, because otherwise we will compare bush and apples.

272
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:23,550
And as we know these different metrics, you can not compare.

273
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:32,100
So let's go a little bit more into the details. So for Article 19, our research development, of course,

274
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:40,290
there is a lot of work going on here that parties are promoting a number of actions aimed to

275
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:48,450
refine national inventories on U.S. consumption and anthropogenic emission queer releases,

276
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:54,210
water body and land of all kinds of mercury medical compounds,

277
00:37:54,210 --> 00:38:03,840
and also are developing modeling capacity in order to use monetary data to assess the risk

278
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:11,190
for population and also the amount of mercury for the risk of falling for four human beings,

279
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:22,690
but also for a number of biotic mediums such as fish, marine mammals, sea turtles and birds, for example.

280
00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:34,270
And then there are a number of assessment of the impact of this mercredi for different social economic,

281
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:42,400
you know, there are different impact besides besides the fact that the economic impact,

282
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:52,570
social impact control impact for different population groups and atomized methodology, of course you need in order to compare.

283
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:58,060
But let's Daniel, of course. As I already mentioned,

284
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:07,120
the two gather information on state of the art information provided by science about the impact of emission

285
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:15,100
at regional and global scale because mercury emission mercury being a global kawaii global pollutant,

286
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:20,290
because as soon as it is released to the atmosphere, it can travel long distances.

287
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:24,850
So if I release mercury in Italy, for example,

288
00:39:24,850 --> 00:39:34,240
my emission can have an impact on Switzerland or Norway or in North Africa because depending on the local materials,

289
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:42,520
you can transport this emission long distances because before being deposited to terrestrial aquatic receptor.

290
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:47,590
So it's also an issues of international policy.

291
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:52,300
So what is the impact of the activity in one country on other countries?

292
00:39:52,300 --> 00:40:01,570
So that is that's why we need an international treaty, because the problem, the issues here is a global issue.

293
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:09,940
And then, of course, the other problem the Article 19 is to put together information on the commerce and trade and

294
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:17,530
also information on the best available technology and best environmental practices and the sole.

295
00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:25,160
The end of this story is that we need to build the global monitoring network through research programs.

296
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:35,410
National Action Plan to make sure that we are able to map the levels of mercury worldwide in different areas of the world.

297
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:37,360
And if we are not still there,

298
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:50,890
as I would show you then for the effectiveness evaluation we are supposed to do the first this first exercise in 2030, in 2023.

299
00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:56,560
So six years later, the entry into force of the convention.

300
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:01,270
And of course, in the meantime, we have been defining the methodology.

301
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:11,950
What are the the key parameters, the monitoring data that we need to consider in evaluation of the effectiveness of the measures?

302
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:17,500
So I'm not going into the details because this is quite boring because so it's not.

303
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:27,490
You can read this later. We do. We did enough time, but we have been producing the guidance on monitoring, uh,

304
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:41,290
harmonized methods in order to make sure that all the mercury levels measured in the biological samples are compatible worthwhile.

305
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:46,030
So what we have air monitoring, we're showing you, you know,

306
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:56,460
you have a number of things that you have missed during the measurement procedure, quality assurance that you can see how you do that.

307
00:41:56,460 --> 00:42:00,010
You can see how you collect the data. The data should be open.

308
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:08,890
So you get to make sure that you have a policy on data sharing to build the meter data information for every sampling site and so on and so on.

309
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:12,610
And so right now,

310
00:42:12,610 --> 00:42:21,040
the indications that we consider for the effectiveness evaluation are total gaseous mercury

311
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:29,950
in ambient air provided by existing monitoring activity worldwide network mercury levels,

312
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:41,020
precipitation again provided by existing monitoring network and then human are, we estimate the impact on human health.

313
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:45,100
So this is down to the for air samples.

314
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:53,530
Primary metrics and then blood samples as alternative metrics and then to epidemiological studies that

315
00:42:53,530 --> 00:43:00,220
passes these countries or regions can promote at the national scale or international so different.

316
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:08,440
The core two studies that have been done already worked, while about more are coming.

317
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:21,940
Then we have the biotic media, so mercury level in diet media at Continental as part of a continental network or oceanographic framework.

318
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:31,540
So we have several oceanographic campaign and the networks that have been ongoing in the last 20 years this year are going over show later.

319
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:40,060
And then we have the the water as such. So mercury levels and sea water covering, for example, a vertical distribution because,

320
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:44,500
you know, you have a lot of movement of mercury that leads to the coastal zone.

321
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:51,940
This from industrial activity, for example, wastewater discharges the rivers and the to the sea.

322
00:43:51,940 --> 00:44:00,220
So this can travel ocean to see depending on the thermocline of distribution and the oceanic transport flow.

323
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:12,430
So it's quite complex. So you need to develop these modeling tools quite sophisticated for both atmospheric and oceanic component compartment.

324
00:44:12,430 --> 00:44:16,900
So now comes the role. So what signs?

325
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:21,520
What are the key question that the policymaker addressed to scientists?

326
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:25,540
So this is is really a big issue.

327
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:33,070
So we have been having several conferences trying to provide an answer to policy relevant question.

328
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:38,950
For example, what are the processes that are affecting continental and global flow of mercury?

329
00:44:38,950 --> 00:44:43,150
And how well do we understand that this this process?

330
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:47,590
So because we need to provide uncertainty is another question, for example,

331
00:44:47,590 --> 00:44:53,530
could be what is the contribution of these intercontinental global flows to concentration

332
00:44:53,530 --> 00:45:01,840
deposition to enter emission from terrestrial and oceanic receptor compare to local source.

333
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:07,900
So why long range transport is very important compared to the local impact,

334
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:16,240
because we have also a local impact about the local impact depends very much on the type of source releasing a.

335
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:21,460
Our future changes in mission in one region will affect Mercredi position,

336
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:27,520
and its impact in the region is what I just mentioned about international policy.

337
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:36,760
So the impact of a mission in one region can create problems in the region, in other countries.

338
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:45,680
I'll need the source to reset the relationship change over the next 20, 50 years due to climate change, for example, or to change in emission.

339
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:56,660
So what is the response time of eco system? So if I reduce, for example, emission from coal coal combustion today by 50 percent, well,

340
00:45:56,660 --> 00:46:05,900
I would see the benefit in terms of maturity reduction in eco system in marine biota sample in the future.

341
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:14,480
How long will it take to lower these levels? So when I would see the benefits, as you know, a politician, they take of decision today.

342
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:21,890
They want to see the impact of tomorrow morning because they don't know if they will be elected again in the next round.

343
00:46:21,890 --> 00:46:26,300
So that is always a question, a challenge.

344
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:34,700
So allow me to the source receptor relationship change from the climate as we know, climate affect a lot these processes.

345
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:39,410
So we are working on this through different modeling approach.

346
00:46:39,410 --> 00:46:46,730
Some different strategies how to evaluate biological end point in assessing the impact.

347
00:46:46,730 --> 00:46:50,390
That is very important because at the end,

348
00:46:50,390 --> 00:47:02,650
we we refer to as metrics to the amount of mercury in different biological samples that can be muddied by you thought that astrobiology like birth.

349
00:47:02,650 --> 00:47:14,830
What efforts are needed to develop and an integrated system that can link observational data, a mission estimate to modeling approach?

350
00:47:14,830 --> 00:47:25,090
And I will show you a little bit later to explain trends over time over the next 10 years, 20 years or the past 10 years, 20 years.

351
00:47:25,090 --> 00:47:42,490
So what I will do now, so just to let me talk here, I would sense now I will start talking about the science policy law.

352
00:47:42,490 --> 00:47:47,140
So we are here at this point. But before proceeding,

353
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:55,270
I'd like to hear if there are any key questions that you need me to answer in order to make clear what I have been saying up to now.

354
00:47:55,270 --> 00:48:04,660
So please just a cross-check just to make sure that we are on the same page and are following without difficulties.

355
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:13,270
What I'm talking about. Anyone have any questions?

356
00:48:13,270 --> 00:48:23,240
I have a quick one. So science policy questions, are they usually targeted at the 141 parties that are involved in the Minimo convention?

357
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:26,950
Correct? So like, who is usually the people that are answering these questions?

358
00:48:26,950 --> 00:48:34,540
Is it a trusted folks who like, How do you how do you select these committees that are the ones who are answering these questions?

359
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:37,900
I don't know if it is that correct. I assume that you might be one of them.

360
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:41,960
But yeah, that's a is a very good question.

361
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:49,060
We are going to provide the answer to this question. Well, in the policy process, different convention recording.

362
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:55,520
I mean, of course, bolstering the long range transport political solution conventional, for example,

363
00:48:55,520 --> 00:49:05,350
have been established some expert group or task forces of a scientist who each horse or energy or part of a political scientist,

364
00:49:05,350 --> 00:49:12,520
but those that know more the problems that you know it's a local at a local scale.

365
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:15,160
So they prepared the so-called the technical report.

366
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:28,570
When I said to Jimmy, the global assessment that you will find on the uniport side, you said, be prepared by scientists, my expert of each sector.

367
00:49:28,570 --> 00:49:33,190
Of course, there is a lot of participation from a number of people,

368
00:49:33,190 --> 00:49:44,980
but the scope is to provide the answer based on the state of our knowledge so that the knowledge as of today,

369
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:51,430
because the decision must be taken on scientific evidence, that is a very that is the key.

370
00:49:51,430 --> 00:50:02,500
Any decision must be taken on the basis of a scientific evidence, not on the on the imagination, because sometimes what is obvious, it's not.

371
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:07,120
It's not that it's not correct. So you need the involvement of science.

372
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:16,960
That's why the participation of scientists the policy process is very important.

373
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:23,770
Is is is a very important commitment for scientists that they should spend some of their

374
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:32,950
time to have a dialog to provide to transfer the knowledge to those that are not silent,

375
00:50:32,950 --> 00:50:40,270
which is very complicated. Let me tell you this because we speak a different language when I speak about the decisions we

376
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:49,330
did with the lawyer expert in international treaty that is that they have a different language.

377
00:50:49,330 --> 00:50:54,760
So you need to mediate the language to find a compromise in order to understand

378
00:50:54,760 --> 00:51:01,660
each other and make sure that you know the message get to the final destination.

379
00:51:01,660 --> 00:51:08,620
So the final destination is to make sure that your message is well understood by

380
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:16,630
those that are writing the rules and the requirement of each law of the treaty.

381
00:51:16,630 --> 00:51:29,380
But every treaty is is ratified by national parliaments in the Democrats, of course, in Democratic countries.

382
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:46,970
And so that's very important. And so that sees the role, you know, expert would provide the answer to this policy delivered which.

383
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:53,460
And then any other question like I have a question about more just about the mercury cycle in of itself.

384
00:51:53,460 --> 00:52:01,770
And I'm kind of curious hypothetically, if we stopped all mercury emissions today when we see a natural decrease in

385
00:52:01,770 --> 00:52:07,260
the amount of mercury in the cycle or I know methylmercury its organic form,

386
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:12,720
and that would probably cycle around plants and animals and algae for a long time.

387
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:17,700
And I'm kind of curious of obviously we need to produce less mercury,

388
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:23,250
but do we have to look into capture technologies or if we just kind of let the natural cycle play out?

389
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:30,070
We'll get to it and stay locked in soil or kind of curious about that.

390
00:52:30,070 --> 00:52:39,420
Yeah, that's is under the million dollar question. You know, if you shut down all the emission from anthropogenic sources today, of course,

391
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:45,990
you have a sort of cycling because you have the legacy of historically the past of the mercury,

392
00:52:45,990 --> 00:52:51,900
at least from anthropogenic sources in the last 200 years or even more.

393
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:58,020
And so you have these legacy cycling between different ecosystems.

394
00:52:58,020 --> 00:53:09,180
And so you will you will not have any you will have always zero emission from natural sources because other natural processes driven.

395
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:13,920
So these processes are driven by climate by a number of factors.

396
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:21,090
So, so use. But still you the anthropogenic signal, the contribution.

397
00:53:21,090 --> 00:53:30,690
Still, you will lower in a certain time frame the amount of mercury that you use segregate

398
00:53:30,690 --> 00:53:35,970
you sorbet accumulated in different wet tropics because in the food web,

399
00:53:35,970 --> 00:53:43,080
that is the natural driven component plastic surgeon, it can prevent a component.

400
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:47,460
So now the scope is reduced, anthropogenic even a component.

401
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:56,970
But then, if you are also successful in climate policy, we can lower also the contribution of natural processes.

402
00:53:56,970 --> 00:54:00,540
Because if you have an increase of the temperature of the ocean of the top water,

403
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:08,010
naturally you will simply have an increase in the emission of mercury from the ocean to the outcomes.

404
00:54:08,010 --> 00:54:14,040
So all the mercury will be, you know, a photo reduced and the top automatically.

405
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:22,110
But if we are able to make progress in the climate change,

406
00:54:22,110 --> 00:54:32,970
all that all those processes that drive the climate change due to emission of carbon dioxide and other long lived pollutant,

407
00:54:32,970 --> 00:54:41,560
we we will make progress also in controlling and lowering the impact of the mercury cycle on the ecosystem in the human heart.

408
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:49,470
So but I will provide you with the link. I will show you that we have been developing an integrated,

409
00:54:49,470 --> 00:54:58,860
interoperable system that you can use online to play with the emission reduction scenario and see

410
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:05,040
what is the impact on the marine biota in terms of reduction of mercury marine biota over time.

411
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:14,970
So just this is the second part of my seminar today, so I will tell you more about this in a few minutes.

412
00:55:14,970 --> 00:55:22,500
Thank you. And the other question.

413
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:28,600
Otherwise, I will put my PowerPoint on again. Sounds good, and I will continue.

414
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:40,530
OK, that's good. So let's. So we have a scene the the.

415
00:55:40,530 --> 00:55:45,180
OK, so we haven't seen this missile defense policy question.

416
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:51,060
So how we deal with this? We have the Science Policy Group, the science and the BBC had a framework.

417
00:55:51,060 --> 00:56:00,960
I'm not sure if you're familiar with this, but it's easy because you have an inventory of a major driver that didn't have a number of pressure on the

418
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:09,300
bottom and so on the ecosystem that can you change the state of the vehicle system due to external variability?

419
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:15,930
You have a number of variability that can change the state of the ecosystem and then you have an impact.

420
00:56:15,930 --> 00:56:20,280
So you are able to to assess the impact.

421
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:27,960
And then, of course, you through different the policy actions that can be of different types.

422
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:37,950
You can you can mediate the right. And so to lower the impact, so you have a gain and losses in terms of impact and response.

423
00:56:37,950 --> 00:56:45,240
So it's like a catch 22 is like a game. So what you can do is that this is a multi-step process.

424
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:52,980
You discover the health issues. So what are the major driver of travel causing this outage?

425
00:56:52,980 --> 00:57:02,190
So you evaluated this driver, then you evaluate the exposure part and what are the patterns that can mitigate this impact,

426
00:57:02,190 --> 00:57:14,340
then the evaluation of socio economic consequences. So what is the impact of this, of this, of these drivers?

427
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:22,610
So you have the you do the risk assessment at different scale, local or regional global?

428
00:57:22,610 --> 00:57:29,660
And then you start doing the policy development, so you do do it to different geographical scale,

429
00:57:29,660 --> 00:57:36,760
country scale, continental, global and then you evaluated the benefits or the benefits and costs.

430
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:45,590
So and then you review the process, you evaluate the effectiveness of your measure to ensure all satisfactory.

431
00:57:45,590 --> 00:57:53,960
You started getting the loop so you start to get in the loop and then use it like an optimization or exercise process.

432
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:59,270
But this just as example, then what we have done.

433
00:57:59,270 --> 00:58:09,210
So just let's focus on this. There are different type of policy action, different type of social economic scenario that can be business as usual.

434
00:58:09,210 --> 00:58:16,520
That is the current state to put practice the business as of today or we have a policy targets and scenario.

435
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:29,030
So based on I mean, I'm at the convention. There are different targets, so I design different the strategy to match the target of the policy actions.

436
00:58:29,030 --> 00:58:33,560
And then there is ideally the degree. So if we shut down all the emission.

437
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:41,840
So what will happen? So this will be the difficulty. So the most cost-effective is somehow but will take time.

438
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:53,020
But. Or we have been in the last 20 years, we've been having different programs in Europe and North America worldwide.

439
00:58:53,020 --> 00:58:59,920
But today I will talk about two important programs just to show you what is the role of science.

440
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:10,990
So is the group on Earth observation that your flagship on Global Positioning System for that is the the portal address the forum?

441
00:59:10,990 --> 00:59:23,080
Dr. If you go there, you can find a lot of information and the integrated tool to play with in a different dimension strategy reduction.

442
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:26,260
And then I will talk. I will introduce this new program.

443
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:33,760
I read that this environmental is a research infrastructure for Environmental Exposure Assessment in Europe piece.

444
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:42,880
We are starting this program, right? During these days or during the last couple of months and then also GMO strain,

445
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:53,680
it is a program for khichdi students that we have in Europe, but with the involvement of several institutions U.S. Canada.

446
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:57,580
So are we forming the new generation of scientists,

447
00:59:57,580 --> 01:00:06,670
so young scientists on on dealing and studying different aspects of the mercury cycle, including the policy issue?

448
01:00:06,670 --> 01:00:10,990
Then there are other programs developing technology, but we don't have time.

449
01:00:10,990 --> 01:00:26,980
But up next time, we'll talk about smart sensor technology, robotic technology to investigate the mercury contamination in the city of Seoul.

450
01:00:26,980 --> 01:00:39,010
But for a I'll talk about a little bit about this group on Earth observation that is an intergovernmental program on Earth observation.

451
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:45,430
There are more than entered the participating member countries, with more than 800 participating organizations,

452
01:00:45,430 --> 01:00:53,080
primarily on the space agency and the research institution worldwide as part of this program.

453
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:59,290
Personally, I am Italian representative in this program since 2015.

454
01:00:59,290 --> 01:01:06,010
So what is the scope of this program? Is to use massive use of Earth observation data.

455
01:01:06,010 --> 01:01:13,300
That means the data gathered from satellites sensor from balloon from easy to

456
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:25,230
from offshore sites to the shape strategy for facing environmental issues.

457
01:01:25,230 --> 01:01:33,360
In particular, in 2016, we created this flagship program that is one of the four flagship program of GEO

458
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:39,300
aiming to support the achievement of goals of the minimum at the convention.

459
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:46,560
This has been a big effort to seize a lot of a participating organization.

460
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:58,770
The scope is to develop a knowledge map and the global observing system that able to provide a comparable data to allow the Minamata Convention to

461
01:01:58,770 --> 01:02:09,840
assess the effectiveness of the measures and also in other scope of this flagship is to support the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals.

462
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:15,600
Several of these goals are part of this strategy.

463
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:24,930
And so we support both M. At the end of 2012, the Green Agenda on Sustainable Development Goal projected,

464
01:02:24,930 --> 01:02:32,040
first of all, excellence integration of CQ and satellite observation to better understand the transport,

465
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:42,450
the prosecution about the pattern of mercury at the continental and global scale and identify or possibly exclude hotspots,

466
01:02:42,450 --> 01:02:55,380
then provide a global compatible monitoring data for Mercury in the other key parameters needed for data analytics and modeling purposes.

467
01:02:55,380 --> 01:03:01,200
It took the goal to double check it used to support the development of a new cost effective

468
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:10,210
equipment sensor to lower investment and the management costs of monitoring network and program.

469
01:03:10,210 --> 01:03:15,080
And that's a geographical coverage of the U.S. global market, as we will see,

470
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:20,930
there are several parts of the globe that are not covered by any monitoring network or monitoring sites,

471
01:03:20,930 --> 01:03:27,560
so we don't have information on the mercury contamination issues.

472
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:35,720
And then to foster the validation that each of the regional and global scale models use for policy scenario analysis,

473
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:42,180
including the evaluation of associated costs.

474
01:03:42,180 --> 01:03:51,090
And the last, but not least, to facilitate actions toward the full interoperability of the data models and the knowledge,

475
01:03:51,090 --> 01:03:55,390
because now one of the issues is we do a lot of observation,

476
01:03:55,390 --> 01:04:01,470
a lot of money spent for monitoring program from satellite and, you know, in-situ network.

477
01:04:01,470 --> 01:04:10,170
But what you do with this data, what is the advantage for policy makers, for the society coming from observation?

478
01:04:10,170 --> 01:04:13,230
Our goods, we are using this data,

479
01:04:13,230 --> 01:04:23,520
this information to make sure that any decision can be taken on the basis of a scientific evidence and at the best of our knowledge.

480
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:29,520
So that is that is the big challenge that as a scientist, we are facing now.

481
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:35,280
So this flagship sees many partners.

482
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:37,350
This slide is not really up to date,

483
01:04:37,350 --> 01:04:50,070
but you can find on the website of the flagship of the most up to date information and also the link to these tools that the data that we have,

484
01:04:50,070 --> 01:04:54,240
the that is the governance. So we have a the focal point at the regional scale.

485
01:04:54,240 --> 01:05:03,690
So we have a focal point of one over one in Asia and Oceania and one in Europe.

486
01:05:03,690 --> 01:05:10,320
And we have established the steering committee and then a number of experts for dealing with different issues like harmonization

487
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:20,730
of a standard operating procedure and the U.S. modeling how to shape a policy scenario and its socio economic evaluation.

488
01:05:20,730 --> 01:05:30,660
So there are different goals. These are the steering committee members and this is the current governance.

489
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:39,720
So I am I'm acting as the chair, but I have three very good co-chairs one from South Africa, Lee will marketing.

490
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:45,210
And then we have some discretion from Canada and those who share one from China.

491
01:05:45,210 --> 01:05:48,780
Then we have a several focal point again in Africa.

492
01:05:48,780 --> 01:05:57,580
We have an e-mail, Martin and then already in demand at the CNRS University of Grenoble Alpes in France.

493
01:05:57,580 --> 01:06:02,700
They will go and then we have David Schmelzer, CPA Committee Chair and then Asia.

494
01:06:02,700 --> 01:06:07,800
We are still defining who can be the leader of this focal point.

495
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:13,950
We are in the process of nominating the scientific advisory board of this flagship.

496
01:06:13,950 --> 01:06:25,500
This is the web portal, as I said. So we can have if you go, you can have a good forum for them to cut the log and burn knowledge tab.

497
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:30,100
And then we have this support system.

498
01:06:30,100 --> 01:06:36,600
So I think if you play with the on this portal, you can get some several interesting information for you.

499
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:40,950
But the scope is to build on this knowledge gap, the knowledge hub. It's like, you know,

500
01:06:40,950 --> 01:06:49,120
big box that you integrate the data modeling tools and including also artificial intelligence told

501
01:06:49,120 --> 01:06:55,080
me if you do with a lot of monitoring data and at one point I strengths and the relationships.

502
01:06:55,080 --> 01:07:02,130
So you call designing policies and how you want to analyze that based on the policy, deliver on the question that we have seen already.

503
01:07:02,130 --> 01:07:07,170
And then you use that observation dataset coming from different sensors.

504
01:07:07,170 --> 01:07:10,950
Then of course, you do a policy scenario assessment.

505
01:07:10,950 --> 01:07:20,130
So as I said, the Earth observation data for Mercury study are provided by different platforms and we have seen this already.

506
01:07:20,130 --> 01:07:33,510
So of oceanographic vessels and so forth, offshore and so on, what are the type of satellite data that we use or you could ask for for us?

507
01:07:33,510 --> 01:07:37,560
So you can see here a list of parameters.

508
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:43,920
So because mercury is quite complex to model in the atmosphere in the Indian Ocean and it

509
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:50,130
interacts with a number of elements and the molecules and other contaminants like cogen,

510
01:07:50,130 --> 01:07:57,270
but nitrogen and Birol, for example, is very important all biology compounds and so on.

511
01:07:57,270 --> 01:08:03,780
So there are different the sensor from satellites that can give you the mapping of these parameters.

512
01:08:03,780 --> 01:08:08,310
So this for the for the optimal.

513
01:08:08,310 --> 01:08:14,070
So what we have done, we have been selecting because you cannot work with the neutral number of parameters.

514
01:08:14,070 --> 01:08:21,990
We have selected these chemical parameters coming from different sensors.

515
01:08:21,990 --> 01:08:28,140
And so you see, I can move this down here.

516
01:08:28,140 --> 01:08:33,270
So this has been mentioned by satellite, but also from aircraft.

517
01:08:33,270 --> 01:08:41,690
So we are in constant. He has to have been promoting a lot of aircraft, a lot of the flights intercontinental.

518
01:08:41,690 --> 01:08:48,080
Large gathering data on the top part of the troposphere or lower stratosphere.

519
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:53,630
And so we have been comparing measurements done and we did a draft with those done with the

520
01:08:53,630 --> 01:09:04,920
satellite and also some called balsall calibration and validation with the easy measurement then.

521
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:10,530
Satellite sensors are used to assess the impact of fire.

522
01:09:10,530 --> 01:09:15,150
So that's very important, as I said, these are small scale gold mining.

523
01:09:15,150 --> 01:09:29,820
So we can use a different satellite to show the land cover and the of change around the mines and also area that with the extensive cloud coverage.

524
01:09:29,820 --> 01:09:33,720
And so we can integrate within see through observation.

525
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:40,280
But we have different satellite sensors here in Europe, this sentimental one and two and in the US each.

526
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:42,450
Landsat, for example,

527
01:09:42,450 --> 01:09:52,380
there are other constellations like or the view constellation that provided a lot of information on the land use change over time.

528
01:09:52,380 --> 01:09:58,500
Then for the sea parameters for all of the heat,

529
01:09:58,500 --> 01:10:05,700
this is the chlorophyl concentration in the top water micro layer of all dissolved organic matter in the top water,

530
01:10:05,700 --> 01:10:10,590
micro layer of suspended sediment concentration or surface temperature.

531
01:10:10,590 --> 01:10:19,320
Surface temperature is very important in the parameters because it controls the emission of material from from the ocean sort of things.

532
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:23,880
So changing temperature at the interface can change a lot the emission,

533
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:31,800
the readmission of mercury back to the atmosphere, but also the deposition process the way back.

534
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:42,390
So these information are gathered from different satellites, different sensor that you see listed on the right side of each table.

535
01:10:42,390 --> 01:10:50,250
And then we can and use many oceanographic Cruz's campaign.

536
01:10:50,250 --> 01:10:58,410
There's also several students from a school public health have been participating in this crucial at the Mediterranean Sea.

537
01:10:58,410 --> 01:11:06,510
But also we have done many crises over the major ocean, including on Paktika and the Arctic Ocean.

538
01:11:06,510 --> 01:11:11,670
So we have a very good data set to be published during the last 10 years.

539
01:11:11,670 --> 01:11:17,220
So there is a huge literature on this. Now what is the current situation?

540
01:11:17,220 --> 01:11:21,690
This is the current map that was prepared for Cop three.

541
01:11:21,690 --> 01:11:33,960
So we talked about that back in 2018. It was the global coverage of these to in in monitoring this active, more active monitoring,

542
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:42,360
we have been adding the passive all the sites in which we use passive a sampler.

543
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:48,750
You can see here, especially in South America, Africa, we are having several policy center.

544
01:11:48,750 --> 01:11:53,610
So the current situation with Persevere Sampler is the following one.

545
01:11:53,610 --> 01:12:02,130
This is a very good cooperation and we the environment Canada with different countries, with different partners to work wide.

546
01:12:02,130 --> 01:12:06,120
So there is a lot of effort to establish a network,

547
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:19,870
all of that now about over 80 sites operating across the more than 50 countries worldwide with possible samplers, which is very cheap.

548
01:12:19,870 --> 01:12:28,650
You basically you don't need to involve, you know, the kitchen and students, but the local operator eats enough,

549
01:12:28,650 --> 01:12:39,120
especially if you are in parts of Africa and the mining and the gold belt in Africa, for example, in Congo, Ivory Coast and Sudan.

550
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:45,180
That is not are not easy places. So we usually don't send the students there, but we have a look.

551
01:12:45,180 --> 01:12:54,870
We have a collaboration with the local scientists, local people in the local university just to promote the smart learning program.

552
01:12:54,870 --> 01:13:03,450
And so is the situation is improving. But still, there is a long way to go in order to fill the gaps worldwide.

553
01:13:03,450 --> 01:13:11,430
But this is the way, so to go. So what we have done and we have been developing, it's several possible sampler.

554
01:13:11,430 --> 01:13:15,260
This is the one developed by Environment Canada, University of Toronto.

555
01:13:15,260 --> 01:13:21,360
And then I've here in Sweden, and then we have one developed in my institute in Italy.

556
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:27,360
So we have been doing it into comparison just to ensure that they give you comparable data.

557
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:36,180
So we have been promoting into campus and exercise. So you can find this in this paper that was published just a year ago.

558
01:13:36,180 --> 01:13:44,850
And so you can get all the details at the three possible sampler worked pretty well, actually.

559
01:13:44,850 --> 01:13:51,480
So it's a very useful because, as I said, these a very cheap technology and easy to use.

560
01:13:51,480 --> 01:13:55,650
So let's go back to the knowledge base.

561
01:13:55,650 --> 01:14:01,530
This is like a big box that you put the data and you get some policies.

562
01:14:01,530 --> 01:14:04,750
Scenario assessment. And so how we do this?

563
01:14:04,750 --> 01:14:13,000
Well, we have observational data, so you have all kind of observational data and do you have a mission event?

564
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:20,290
You have a number of other information that you need to run a numerical model.

565
01:14:20,290 --> 01:14:24,150
So then you run, you get all these data.

566
01:14:24,150 --> 01:14:32,260
You run a fake model and then marine and buzzer chemical model and then the trophic transfer model.

567
01:14:32,260 --> 01:14:39,760
At the end, you get to the answer that you want. So how much mercury we see in the biological and.

568
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:46,420
And now this can change over time. So for the atmospheric component, we are using different type of model,

569
01:14:46,420 --> 01:14:52,150
but primarily a marriage that is the first model using the least and the juice can.

570
01:14:52,150 --> 01:14:58,300
Then we were supposed to get also this model from Moscow Meteorological Synthesizing

571
01:14:58,300 --> 01:15:05,900
Center East that is used for the UN Convention on Long Range Transport of Air Pollutants,

572
01:15:05,900 --> 01:15:11,470
but this is not yet active and also the one from Canada and Britain and Canada.

573
01:15:11,470 --> 01:15:13,090
But at the end, with this model,

574
01:15:13,090 --> 01:15:25,480
you have a number of modeling outputs that you used to elaborate the response of the ozone input to the ocean oceanic models that you use.

575
01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:31,300
So if you go on the on the geo flagship report on the priority,

576
01:15:31,300 --> 01:15:40,240
all you will find that the screen shot like this so you can play with the reducing emission in different regions of the world.

577
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:48,280
And then you get, for example, a 50 percent reduction of emission in Europe and North America and East Asia.

578
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:52,720
You can even choose the speciation and the emission.

579
01:15:52,720 --> 01:16:03,550
So what? What could be the speciation from from a specific source so you can deal already with, for example, coal combustion?

580
01:16:03,550 --> 01:16:15,580
And then you get this type of evaluation. So what are the changing the changes in the position in different ocean setting?

581
01:16:15,580 --> 01:16:27,310
And so this is what you get in terms of mercury deposition and this is what you get in terms of the orbit of the ocean and over the land.

582
01:16:27,310 --> 01:16:33,190
So this is the two. But for now, if you go on this web portal,

583
01:16:33,190 --> 01:16:38,630
you will get also statistical elaboration of the significant statistical

584
01:16:38,630 --> 01:16:47,740
significance is the change observed in different setting for different ecosystem.

585
01:16:47,740 --> 01:16:58,360
And then you can do the tagging of admission. So what is the impact of domestic orbits of Earth?

586
01:16:58,360 --> 01:17:06,400
And so you can map a lot of this of this scenario, but also sorry what I do, not every year.

587
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:09,610
But for now, we have been adding the traffic models.

588
01:17:09,610 --> 01:17:25,300
So you get other output from this online system that can give you the trend of variation over mercury by accumulated in body fluids.

589
01:17:25,300 --> 01:17:31,720
So I don't have any on or mind like this. But if you go on the website on the portal, you can play with this.

590
01:17:31,720 --> 01:17:43,390
You can have if you have any questions that are the contact people there that work on this knowledge hub that are available for questions or

591
01:17:43,390 --> 01:17:55,360
just send an email to me and I will be redirected to your request or clarification or integration to the appropriate people in my institute.

592
01:17:55,360 --> 01:18:00,510
So let's. Now we talk about deeper.

593
01:18:00,510 --> 01:18:06,720
A lot of it. One of the issues that we discuss in every meeting that we have a lot of observation.

594
01:18:06,720 --> 01:18:13,890
So what do we do with this data? So we have a data expert, health observation expert.

595
01:18:13,890 --> 01:18:19,140
Then we have environmental experts, those that deal with the environmental issues.

596
01:18:19,140 --> 01:18:24,510
They know where the water, the driver, the impact factor.

597
01:18:24,510 --> 01:18:28,770
And then we have those experts that deal with the global change.

598
01:18:28,770 --> 01:18:36,420
So what is the impact on global society and so educators, as we call it?

599
01:18:36,420 --> 01:18:41,580
And then we have the policy make that three percent of the children.

600
01:18:41,580 --> 01:18:48,030
So those that will take this action in order to lower the impact of a certain environmental issue and the problem.

601
01:18:48,030 --> 01:18:52,210
So this is the learning curve. Right now we are here.

602
01:18:52,210 --> 01:18:56,280
We are good in providing observational data,

603
01:18:56,280 --> 01:19:08,250
but I'm sure tomorrow we will be able to define essential variables in order to support environmental experts to do their own assessment.

604
01:19:08,250 --> 01:19:13,500
That will take time, you know, to provide a qualified answer to policymakers.

605
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:18,180
So the number of questions addressed by policymakers to scientists.

606
01:19:18,180 --> 01:19:21,600
Of course, we are able to provide answer.

607
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:30,780
But the scale of the integration of a full integration of science with the policy making process is still underway.

608
01:19:30,780 --> 01:19:40,740
So underway and in progress, so it will take some time in order to provide the key indicators to do the environmental assessment and to make sure

609
01:19:40,740 --> 01:19:50,910
that policy make a big decision and have a strategy elaborated in order to allow people to have a good investment.

610
01:19:50,910 --> 01:20:07,650
So nation countries to invest public money that are able this investment to solve the issues that it can so improve the quality of life.

611
01:20:07,650 --> 01:20:17,970
So I was mentioning the new program aiming to link environmental observation and the human exposure and risk assessment.

612
01:20:17,970 --> 01:20:20,100
So who three years ago,

613
01:20:20,100 --> 01:20:31,590
we have been starting a dialog with the European Commission to build the so-called research infrastructure that is a distributed all over Europe.

614
01:20:31,590 --> 01:20:41,910
It is part of the researches, the very important decisions or structured programing in Europe that people promoted the

615
01:20:41,910 --> 01:20:48,270
development of a European scale research infrastructure that all scientists and students can use.

616
01:20:48,270 --> 01:20:57,870
You know, choosing from Italy or from France can go to UK or Denmark, Sweden to use labs and all the research and research.

617
01:20:57,870 --> 01:21:00,060
So I am part of this coordination team.

618
01:21:00,060 --> 01:21:12,960
The coordinator is our colleague Yannick, on about a piece at the Masaryk University in Brno in Czech Republic and also Roberto Farooqi in France.

619
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:18,780
And so we have all these are the countries involved.

620
01:21:18,780 --> 01:21:29,100
Currently, we have also us and the report very soon as part of this network.

621
01:21:29,100 --> 01:21:37,350
And so this is the strategy. So on the left side that you see listed the monitoring networks, so no more.

622
01:21:37,350 --> 01:21:42,060
They are not for environmental monitoring network here.

623
01:21:42,060 --> 01:21:53,970
Then we have also human exposure networks for biobank, the court of expert studies and a lot of big data and human and bio monitoring.

624
01:21:53,970 --> 01:22:02,130
So the scope is to promote exposure for many epigenetic and the metabolomic proteomic

625
01:22:02,130 --> 01:22:11,580
research in order to evaluate the non-rich genetic factor causing risk for human health.

626
01:22:11,580 --> 01:22:18,570
So what are the factors that are not related to genetic but are related to

627
01:22:18,570 --> 01:22:26,070
environmental contamination that people are impacted by in order to evaluate the risk?

628
01:22:26,070 --> 01:22:37,890
So on top of this, there is a lot of by a complete change at the bottom by statistic, the use of artificial intelligence for data interpretation.

629
01:22:37,890 --> 01:22:53,520
Then, of course, on the activities of data management in overlap, the guideline for simple treatment and final analysis and so forth.

630
01:22:53,520 --> 01:23:05,550
So of course, part of this study started monetization or monetization is the key word of a methodology UC system and then a lot of capacity building.

631
01:23:05,550 --> 01:23:12,400
So did this. This infrastructure will keep us busy for the next 10 years.

632
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:21,570
So five years I will be retired, but I will continue to contribute eventually, so other people will keep going on this.

633
01:23:21,570 --> 01:23:31,980
And so it's a long term program. That's right. So we have 10 years implementation, a strategic plan for this, and we could train the same network,

634
01:23:31,980 --> 01:23:43,800
different distribution on environmental issues, human health risk assessment research in Europe and also outside the Europe.

635
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:50,100
Then also for my sister and the pitch instrument, we have a lot of training.

636
01:23:50,100 --> 01:24:00,310
This is a medic duty free program in a Europe that is supporting 15 students.

637
01:24:00,310 --> 01:24:10,560
You need to start doing their research, push the program project on different aspects of global budget chemical motorcycle.

638
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:14,220
So we are preparing a new generation of scientists in Europe.

639
01:24:14,220 --> 01:24:23,610
So we are we have students coming from all over the world who are not a European only, but from coming from different world.

640
01:24:23,610 --> 01:24:33,450
It was an open call. We have been selecting the best students that applied for this program, so we are at the second year of the program.

641
01:24:33,450 --> 01:24:47,100
So they are working and doing research both on modeling, monitoring and also policy interaction of the policy as well.

642
01:24:47,100 --> 01:24:58,860
And so we have different countries involved here, and we have several participating organizations that you see on your right on this slide.

643
01:24:58,860 --> 01:25:06,930
So that is another contribution of the science is providing to the policy.

644
01:25:06,930 --> 01:25:12,180
So I think of the scientists playing a very important role in all this.

645
01:25:12,180 --> 01:25:19,440
And so that was my last slide and thank you for your attention.

646
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:25,170
And if you have any question, please do not hesitate to address any questions.

647
01:25:25,170 --> 01:25:37,360
Thank you. You both have questions.

648
01:25:37,360 --> 01:25:48,740
Mm-Hmm. You know, we're here. Yeah, I guess I have a question and so on.

649
01:25:48,740 --> 01:25:54,320
I feel like it's hard not to draw parallels to climate change when looking at Mercury and the convention process.

650
01:25:54,320 --> 01:26:00,890
And I know at least in discussions of climate change, this bill is kind of like convention fatigue or it takes a lot of resources to get that

651
01:26:00,890 --> 01:26:05,150
together and you don't see a whole lot of progress and I agree that they're important.

652
01:26:05,150 --> 01:26:10,670
But do you know if there's any other avenues to tackle Mercury outside of the convention process?

653
01:26:10,670 --> 01:26:16,370
Or is that probably our best way of handling the situation?

654
01:26:16,370 --> 01:26:26,720
Know the only way to make sure that the minimum at the convention is well implemented and these are signed on by all countries.

655
01:26:26,720 --> 01:26:31,520
And because it's quite complex, you need to wherever you have to,

656
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:42,530
you have to make sure that the mission and scale you are able to implement and take a decision on the way we produce the goods, for example.

657
01:26:42,530 --> 01:26:51,560
So you have to phase out the use of mercury in the manufacturing processes, as well as the usual method of assemble seal.

658
01:26:51,560 --> 01:26:57,740
Mercury is used a lot in electronics in the pharmaceutical industry and also in

659
01:26:57,740 --> 01:27:03,800
several manufacturing processes that they have not found yet replacement of.

660
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:10,880
Because Mercury is a very good chemical and physical property, that's why he's widely used.

661
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:14,870
So the only way to deal with this, you need to rely on policy.

662
01:27:14,870 --> 01:27:22,880
You have to have we have we have to push to make sure that the treaty and the Convention on Climate Change, for example,

663
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:32,660
that there's a huge impact on mercury cycle you to make progress because I know that for assembly in Europe and now we have the war.

664
01:27:32,660 --> 01:27:40,580
So people are focused on different things. And we started to just last year, a very ambitious program.

665
01:27:40,580 --> 01:27:52,450
The so-called ecological transition phase out the use of fossil fuels for from energy production and big investment in solar energy,

666
01:27:52,450 --> 01:28:01,250
wind and solar farms and so forth. Now, unfortunately, we are dealing with these regional issues that is of global impact.

667
01:28:01,250 --> 01:28:03,500
Hopefully, this will end soon.

668
01:28:03,500 --> 01:28:11,810
That is our hope and that we can restart the to talk about the ecological transition and the major environmental policy worldwide.

669
01:28:11,810 --> 01:28:20,780
And the people can really make progress and the countries are going to make progress in the phasing into in the contract.

670
01:28:20,780 --> 01:28:29,480
Combating these climate change issues because it is a big issue has a huge impact on different sectors like agriculture,

671
01:28:29,480 --> 01:28:39,080
energy and environmental quality. And so that that that the only way there is no other alternative way.

672
01:28:39,080 --> 01:28:47,960
So we have to stay on the track of international trade. Make sure that these treaties are not forgotten by politicians, by countries.

673
01:28:47,960 --> 01:28:53,510
When they do the budget every year, they decide what and spending the money for the country,

674
01:28:53,510 --> 01:28:57,620
so they have to make sure that decisions are taken oriented.

675
01:28:57,620 --> 01:29:01,730
These decisions are oriented to protect our global environment.

676
01:29:01,730 --> 01:29:07,430
And you need a number of action and investment because you need to budget.

677
01:29:07,430 --> 01:29:18,380
You need the money to do otherwise. So you have to make a choice if you want to spend the money to to feed your dyami or to make war.

678
01:29:18,380 --> 01:29:25,700
So you want to spend the money to make sure that people have a better environment, a clean environment and a better life.

679
01:29:25,700 --> 01:29:37,860
So that is a political decision. Yeah,

680
01:29:37,860 --> 01:29:43,980
I have a bit more of a question around like the way that you talk to the public about Mercury and the importance of

681
01:29:43,980 --> 01:29:51,240
also garnering public concern in regards to continuing to make sure that there's protections around mercury emissions.

682
01:29:51,240 --> 01:29:52,770
I mean, I'm thinking about lead,

683
01:29:52,770 --> 01:29:59,940
particularly in how in the United States there's been like this renaissance because of Lent and people carrying more and more about lead.

684
01:29:59,940 --> 01:30:01,650
And I don't know if, like,

685
01:30:01,650 --> 01:30:09,960
what do you find is like the most effective ways to adequately communicate to the public about mercury or to garner public concern in that regard?

686
01:30:09,960 --> 01:30:15,780
Because I think like there's that atmospheric level, but I'm sure also like talking to people and being like,

687
01:30:15,780 --> 01:30:19,620
you know, if you eat a lot of fish, you could have like severe birth defects or something like that.

688
01:30:19,620 --> 01:30:26,730
Like, I wonder like how or if public concern is ever something that comes into play in your work?

689
01:30:26,730 --> 01:30:33,360
Well, education, education, you know, to spend the time to educate people,

690
01:30:33,360 --> 01:30:40,470
to let people understand the nature of the environmental issues, what could be the impact on human health?

691
01:30:40,470 --> 01:30:45,090
What are the exposure patterns, what everyone can do?

692
01:30:45,090 --> 01:30:51,900
Because personally, we can do a lot on a personal basis to prevent many problems.

693
01:30:51,900 --> 01:30:58,800
And so to lower the exposure, for example, very often people say, OK,

694
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:04,290
I know that the fish is contaminated by mercury, so it is better that I eat meat.

695
01:31:04,290 --> 01:31:06,240
That's wrong because we need to eat fish.

696
01:31:06,240 --> 01:31:16,440
Fish is very important for our diet, but eventually, instead of of eating a big stick of tuna fish or Shrek or shark or whatever you like you,

697
01:31:16,440 --> 01:31:24,960
you eat smaller fish where the concentration of mercury is much lower because mercury is by accumulate.

698
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:32,130
So I know that the tuna steak or or whatever you like the big stick, it's good.

699
01:31:32,130 --> 01:31:41,430
It's so tasty. But perhaps you have to mediate and you can make a good choice, so inform the people what is the best way.

700
01:31:41,430 --> 01:31:50,550
What type of fish you can eat and what is the benefit for the heart health and why we should, you know,

701
01:31:50,550 --> 01:32:04,980
even for example, in many places like in Indonesia, the for for region reason, they do not eat rice imported.

702
01:32:04,980 --> 01:32:09,240
They need to create the rice produced locally.

703
01:32:09,240 --> 01:32:15,270
But very often these sites are contaminated sites, so they eat rice produced in contaminated sites.

704
01:32:15,270 --> 01:32:24,330
So to educate people that you know well in order to lower the risk due to ingestion of contaminated

705
01:32:24,330 --> 01:32:31,590
rice is very important because they represent a good fraction of mercury ingested on annual beaches.

706
01:32:31,590 --> 01:32:35,310
Because in those places, they eat rice like wheat bread.

707
01:32:35,310 --> 01:32:41,490
In Italy, for example, you know that people in Italy cannot live without bread.

708
01:32:41,490 --> 01:32:47,640
So the same goes for for these people that use rice as basic of their diet.

709
01:32:47,640 --> 01:32:55,620
So but if they eat rice, that is very contaminated, of course, that is that is issue of gation.

710
01:32:55,620 --> 01:33:01,860
It's very important driver in convincing the people that they can do a lot on their home.

711
01:33:01,860 --> 01:33:08,370
Then of course, there is also the contribution of the national policy global actions.

712
01:33:08,370 --> 01:33:18,270
But a new creation is the basic informing the people with the state or with the state of all knowledge, with the knowledge that is very important.

713
01:33:18,270 --> 01:33:24,180
That's why in the policy implementation process, organization like an NGO,

714
01:33:24,180 --> 01:33:29,340
a military usually play a very important role because they have very local impact.

715
01:33:29,340 --> 01:33:36,210
They do a local action to transfer to the people the good information,

716
01:33:36,210 --> 01:33:50,460
good education in order to allow them to protect their own health so they can avoid what these loading back more revenge.

717
01:33:50,460 --> 01:34:08,010
I'm not sure if I answered your question. No, it does. Thank you. And the other question that folks have.

718
01:34:08,010 --> 01:34:18,000
Nicole, I have a question. Go ahead. So you mentioned just in the last several weeks, you know, the complications of the war breaking out.

719
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:25,050
And then, you know, prior to this, we've had a couple of years of dealing with a global pandemic.

720
01:34:25,050 --> 01:34:38,400
And next year and 2023 is the first kind of required formal assessment of the progress of that convention.

721
01:34:38,400 --> 01:34:48,260
What what do you see as some of the, you know, the findings or the results from that initial assessment of the progress?

722
01:34:48,260 --> 01:34:55,880
Well, you know, it's unfortunate that I was not at the top four in Bali last week was not able to go.

723
01:34:55,880 --> 01:35:07,400
So I don't have the latest information, although I have been in contact with the other colleagues through different telecon during the last week.

724
01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:19,340
But I think that the the last assessment that we have done is is a pretty advanced

725
01:35:19,340 --> 01:35:23,990
and many countries are going to implement an initial assessment worldwide.

726
01:35:23,990 --> 01:35:27,020
So especially in developing countries.

727
01:35:27,020 --> 01:35:35,210
So there is a good cooperation between experts and the national representative in order to have a better picture.

728
01:35:35,210 --> 01:35:41,000
What is the situation in countries and especially in developing countries?

729
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:54,020
So overall, I think the the Minamata Convention is a successful example of cooperation between science and policy making,

730
01:35:54,020 --> 01:36:06,260
although of course nothing is perfect. And also, during the last two years, we did it several actions being quite complicated to carry out.

731
01:36:06,260 --> 01:36:13,430
So because we have done several meetings online, it's not the same as in-person meeting you need,

732
01:36:13,430 --> 01:36:18,020
especially when you manage a program like capacity building a transfer of knowledge.

733
01:36:18,020 --> 01:36:24,260
You need a personal contact with the people because that is very important.

734
01:36:24,260 --> 01:36:35,900
We explain with the simple words, the complex concept, but I think.

735
01:36:35,900 --> 01:36:45,740
We'll see. We have a telecon planned in the next couple of weeks to assess also what has

736
01:36:45,740 --> 01:36:52,730
been eventually the effect of COVID on the implementation of the strategy,

737
01:36:52,730 --> 01:36:58,130
for example, in the last couple of years during the COVID period.

738
01:36:58,130 --> 01:37:05,300
We we prepare the guidelines on monitoring. We made progress on expanding the monitoring network.

739
01:37:05,300 --> 01:37:19,370
With the past year simpler, we did less progress in interaction with the weed society we did with the NGO with or also students were

740
01:37:19,370 --> 01:37:27,200
not able to move around to have a change over students and scientists that this was completely blocked.

741
01:37:27,200 --> 01:37:31,610
So certainly we need to recover some lost time.

742
01:37:31,610 --> 01:37:36,520
But overall, this situation isn't all that bad.

743
01:37:36,520 --> 01:37:48,710
So I think we will make progress and which I think as far as I heard, but I haven't had any document.

744
01:37:48,710 --> 01:37:57,590
The increased also the investment for the UNEP chemicals in charge to follow the market and to make sure that

745
01:37:57,590 --> 01:38:06,110
these were implemented through the Global Environmental Facility Trust Fund supporting developing countries.

746
01:38:06,110 --> 01:38:11,880
And so we'll see. We'll follow.

747
01:38:11,880 --> 01:38:17,720
So sounds good. I've got one more follow up question.

748
01:38:17,720 --> 01:38:21,590
So you mentioned earlier the like the Stockholm Convention.

749
01:38:21,590 --> 01:38:32,180
In the past, we've talked about the Montreal Protocol, the Kyoto Protocol, and now we're talking about the M.I.T convention.

750
01:38:32,180 --> 01:38:39,140
And you know, some of these international policies are somewhat more successful than others.

751
01:38:39,140 --> 01:38:48,890
Know in your view, what is it about the Minnesota convention that that's allowed it to be successful compared to perhaps,

752
01:38:48,890 --> 01:38:54,140
you know, some of the other protocols around other challenges?

753
01:38:54,140 --> 01:39:02,060
Well, the first reason that when you talk about the Stockholm Convention, you talk about sports, as you know, bobsledder G100.

754
01:39:02,060 --> 01:39:07,010
And so it's not easy. Mercury is just one.

755
01:39:07,010 --> 01:39:13,370
So that is the big defender. We know much better mercury than many pops.

756
01:39:13,370 --> 01:39:23,300
Indeed, the Stockholm Convention was updated already a couple of times with the emerging box and the steel.

757
01:39:23,300 --> 01:39:26,660
We don't have a standardized methodology for several blocks.

758
01:39:26,660 --> 01:39:37,130
And so the Stockholm is very complicated, very complex because of the organic pollutants that are complex.

759
01:39:37,130 --> 01:39:43,460
And also the Stockholm Convention is affected by climate change just like every convention.

760
01:39:43,460 --> 01:39:51,320
So the the the primary policy team to secure and is the one that is on climate change.

761
01:39:51,320 --> 01:40:07,430
So we had the COP26 in Edinburgh last year, that was not a very successful or, you know, was not to was not bad, but could be better.

762
01:40:07,430 --> 01:40:17,670
At least, you know, countries decided to control the VRC emission from agricultural sector.

763
01:40:17,670 --> 01:40:28,020
But still, it is quite complicated, so I think the Minamata Convention compared to other convention.

764
01:40:28,020 --> 01:40:41,180
It's much easier, let's put it this way. So I think this and also there is a lot of participation vision of scientists.

765
01:40:41,180 --> 01:40:48,580
Yeah, that's that's definitely a strength. Any other comments or questions, folks coming to mind?

766
01:40:48,580 --> 01:41:03,970
It doesn't have to be a question. It can actually be a comment or an observation even.

767
01:41:03,970 --> 01:41:07,420
I think we're okay, Nicole. OK.

768
01:41:07,420 --> 01:41:19,090
So I hope next time it'll be in person there for the first time, so hopefully, you know, the situation will be better in the next months, hopefully.

769
01:41:19,090 --> 01:41:27,790
Yes, I agree. Then we get finished class as a group and go to have a share, a beer and some appetizers together.

770
01:41:27,790 --> 01:41:33,130
Yeah, that's very good. Yeah, we can go in all the places that I used to go.

771
01:41:33,130 --> 01:41:43,810
So that is always a pleasure to be in and out. And this group public health and we miss having you here.

772
01:41:43,810 --> 01:41:47,980
Yeah, I miss I miss the U of M as well.

773
01:41:47,980 --> 01:41:57,760
And then Adebayo's nice city. But so let's hope that the first of all, that we don't have any more COVID issues in this in the fall.

774
01:41:57,760 --> 01:42:05,080
And although, you know, in Italy rising up again, although he's just been fine,

775
01:42:05,080 --> 01:42:10,510
so we don't know these, these different species of virus behaves strictly.

776
01:42:10,510 --> 01:42:16,300
And so it's it's a it's a it's a big question mark.

777
01:42:16,300 --> 01:42:20,740
But thank you so much for inviting me.

778
01:42:20,740 --> 01:42:27,560
And it's been a pleasure for me, and I look forward to be there in person soon.

779
01:42:27,560 --> 01:42:48,650
Sounds good to go. Thank you. Thank you so much. Bye.

780
01:42:48,650 --> 01:42:59,000
Claire, you're welcome to hang on as we debrief here.

781
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:06,410
All right. So now you're like the pressure's off. Any other questions, comments, observations and so forth?

782
01:43:06,410 --> 01:43:12,770
You have read it. You have these slides. I don't. But I'll ask for them and post them.

783
01:43:12,770 --> 01:43:18,890
I know some of those things, like as you can clearly see right now, the smallest Typekit ever.

784
01:43:18,890 --> 01:43:26,270
Yes, I'll get them and then post them the way I usually do with the link by the date of the class period.

785
01:43:26,270 --> 01:43:31,280
Good question. Yeah, Bianca, is this like a politically contentious issue?

786
01:43:31,280 --> 01:43:38,420
Like, are there groups that actively oppose this type of legislation for Mercury specifically?

787
01:43:38,420 --> 01:43:53,870
Yeah. Well, so so when Nikola was talking about Mercury is widely available and it's inexpensive even if you try to regulate it and control it.

788
01:43:53,870 --> 01:43:59,270
There's this humongous, basically black market of mercury.

789
01:43:59,270 --> 01:44:09,230
Um, and you know, he talked about some of the ASTM mining in an African while the continent.

790
01:44:09,230 --> 01:44:17,900
But in various regions of Africa, for example, there is very purposeful health, uh,

791
01:44:17,900 --> 01:44:25,460
international health projects where where resources go towards, uh, you know, good dental hygiene.

792
01:44:25,460 --> 01:44:32,270
Right? And so mercury amalgams are like an inexpensive way to like, have good dental health.

793
01:44:32,270 --> 01:44:39,860
So it goes to those African nations, and much of it doesn't actually arrive at the dental clinics, right?

794
01:44:39,860 --> 01:44:46,220
It gets kind of siphoned off to the side by people that take a few bucks, you know, to make sure it goes somewhere else.

795
01:44:46,220 --> 01:44:53,180
And now it's it's being put into those crucibles and, you know, used to extract gold.

796
01:44:53,180 --> 01:45:04,340
Um, so and as you know, as long as there is a demand for gold as a precious metal internationally, it will.

797
01:45:04,340 --> 01:45:09,770
So it's not that like, you know that there's this huge lobby, you know, like in some of the other issues that we've talked about,

798
01:45:09,770 --> 01:45:18,980
there's not this huge lobby pressuring politicians, necessarily, but at a much more, you know, kind of organic level.

799
01:45:18,980 --> 01:45:23,260
Uh, there is inefficiencies for sure.

800
01:45:23,260 --> 01:45:27,280
And that does that. Does that answer your answers? OK.

801
01:45:27,280 --> 01:45:32,890
OK. Yeah, that's right. He's like, he's a very interesting fellow because he, like, wears a lot of hats.

802
01:45:32,890 --> 01:45:36,110
Absolutely. Yeah. I often think about like, you know,

803
01:45:36,110 --> 01:45:41,210
folks like epidemiologist or they're involved in health policy management or they're interested in

804
01:45:41,210 --> 01:45:48,170
health behavior and communications where he seems to kind of just like all of them all the time.

805
01:45:48,170 --> 01:45:52,250
And I'm like, and I must be so exhausting. Yes.

806
01:45:52,250 --> 01:45:56,270
And also kind of mind boggling. But he has a great resume, for sure.

807
01:45:56,270 --> 01:46:03,170
I wonder what a team of people would look like because I'm like, Yeah, it sounds like, you know,

808
01:46:03,170 --> 01:46:12,230
like you have to be an expert and direct and communicate this to politicians who have are laymen in regards like Mercury anything?

809
01:46:12,230 --> 01:46:19,100
Yeah. And so like, why isn't there an intermediary there that is like it's their job to make sure that this is accessible?

810
01:46:19,100 --> 01:46:26,000
Yeah, sure. Yeah. Well, and you know, this is the exact reason why a lot of you are taking the classes and in the programs that

811
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:33,350
you're in is to perhaps go out and be able to help fill those gaps and make the process,

812
01:46:33,350 --> 01:46:39,320
you know, a bit more effective. But yeah, it's a great observation.

813
01:46:39,320 --> 01:46:47,000
You know, so a little bit of background on Dr. Brown, his his Ph.D. he's trained as a nuclear physicist.

814
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:54,140
OK, you know. And you know, so suddenly he started studying like the environment, right?

815
01:46:54,140 --> 01:46:58,730
He talked about all of those field studies in the labs in developing technology and stuff.

816
01:46:58,730 --> 01:47:03,440
He's got like, zero, you know, training in that stuff, right? And also from the policy side.

817
01:47:03,440 --> 01:47:10,790
And I'm glad he phrased it the way he did, right? He said going back 20 some years ago, you know, I was invited to this and I was providing,

818
01:47:10,790 --> 01:47:16,040
you know, an input into this kind of, you know, starting to form policy around this issue.

819
01:47:16,040 --> 01:47:20,150
And it was very educational, right to kind of start to learn the OK,

820
01:47:20,150 --> 01:47:25,490
what is what's the perspective of the policymaker and in trying to to appreciate that.

821
01:47:25,490 --> 01:47:30,470
And you know, it's one thing to be a scientist and saying, Yeah, we know Mercury is bad.

822
01:47:30,470 --> 01:47:36,710
I'm going to go do a bunch of cool science to help, you know, address how we might be able to improve it.

823
01:47:36,710 --> 01:47:43,850
But, you know, for most policymakers to pick up like a peer reviewed journal article and read it and be

824
01:47:43,850 --> 01:47:48,860
able to get even some like base level take-home message is there is a huge challenge,

825
01:47:48,860 --> 01:47:57,520
right? So being able to and this is something that Nikola has really developed at his research institute in Italy and across Europe.

826
01:47:57,520 --> 01:48:04,000
Internationally, really, he talked about all those different monitoring networks that he's been coordinating

827
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:11,140
is to to really be attempting to be listening to those policy makers,

828
01:48:11,140 --> 01:48:17,200
right? And looking at all of the questions coming from the policy side and saying, OK,

829
01:48:17,200 --> 01:48:26,680
these are the questions, how can we design our our monitoring system, you know, spatially temporally,

830
01:48:26,680 --> 01:48:31,420
what's required for it to be statistically significant so that we have the best

831
01:48:31,420 --> 01:48:36,010
chance of that data being able to actually inform those specific questions,

832
01:48:36,010 --> 01:48:40,520
right? Not just what I think are cool questions to ask, right?

833
01:48:40,520 --> 01:48:53,710
As a scientist and it's I agree. It's uh, it takes, uh, a multi-talented person to be able to wear those hats kind of all at the same time.

834
01:48:53,710 --> 01:48:57,160
Yeah. Excellent observation, sir. Your question?

835
01:48:57,160 --> 01:49:00,670
Yeah. Small comment, kind of going off with some of what Katrina saying.

836
01:49:00,670 --> 01:49:04,780
I just found the like health communications part of this, like very, very interesting.

837
01:49:04,780 --> 01:49:08,640
Especially know the acronym is the small scale gold.

838
01:49:08,640 --> 01:49:16,300
Yes. And how we briefly touched on like education and how that's like a really big barrier and like communicating a lot of these concepts.

839
01:49:16,300 --> 01:49:24,220
And I know in this class we've talked about like informing the public, it's like one of the number one, the kind of solutions towards these issues.

840
01:49:24,220 --> 01:49:32,060
But when you know, folks can't understand or it's beneficial right now, that's really, really tough.

841
01:49:32,060 --> 01:49:35,830
So I was just really interested in, you know, how you go about doing that,

842
01:49:35,830 --> 01:49:41,530
especially when he showed that map of like where this like Aspen is like occurring and you've

843
01:49:41,530 --> 01:49:47,560
got all of these different sorts of cultures and populations like you have some sort of like,

844
01:49:47,560 --> 01:49:51,790
how do you make the vaccine right? That's easily translatable into all of these?

845
01:49:51,790 --> 01:49:55,880
Yeah. Yeah, he's I just thought that was really fascinating. Yeah, yeah.

846
01:49:55,880 --> 01:50:01,000
It's a challenge. Compounding that, too, like, I mean, a lot of lives depend on the country.

847
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:05,050
Those operations like this cottage mining industries are illegal in of itself.

848
01:50:05,050 --> 01:50:13,010
So this is extracting this. They're not even following the local laws to some extent, but you have this year's mercury.

849
01:50:13,010 --> 01:50:16,600
Like, how do you prepare messages? It's interesting.

850
01:50:16,600 --> 01:50:22,100
How do you how do you host a workshop and invite all of the legal practitioners to come and learn about it, right?

851
01:50:22,100 --> 01:50:27,220
Yeah, it is not very conducive despite the the structure, right?

852
01:50:27,220 --> 01:50:33,040
I don't know if I just heard, but the misselling also provided some instructions about safer practices de novo mercury.

853
01:50:33,040 --> 01:50:38,900
So like, you know, you're doing things you're not supposed to do, but we want to write like Elise or like a mask or something.

854
01:50:38,900 --> 01:50:43,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. And there's so many layers, right?

855
01:50:43,660 --> 01:50:50,860
I mean, going back to your kind of observation, Sara, you know, globally, right?

856
01:50:50,860 --> 01:50:56,200
He talked about our choice of, you know, whatever the shark or something or the tuna steak versus,

857
01:50:56,200 --> 01:50:59,800
you know, some other fish, they would have less mercury in it. That's one thing, right?

858
01:50:59,800 --> 01:51:04,870
Like if you like in high income countries where you can spend, you can basically choose.

859
01:51:04,870 --> 01:51:11,590
All right. We need to be educated and that's, you know, one kind of educational objective.

860
01:51:11,590 --> 01:51:20,590
But it it it really comes down to at the most basic level, like from a from a health perspective, and that's through ingestion.

861
01:51:20,590 --> 01:51:23,890
These are kind of two different exposure rounds, right?

862
01:51:23,890 --> 01:51:33,220
Most of what globally, most of the health risk is from ingesting mercury in food when he's talking about the miners, right?

863
01:51:33,220 --> 01:51:41,350
These artisanal small scale gold miners, they are literally dumping like liquid mercury into a bowl with all of this sediment stuff

864
01:51:41,350 --> 01:51:50,140
and it amalgamate with the gold and then you take a blowtorch and just burn off the mercury.

865
01:51:50,140 --> 01:51:52,870
So it's like, you know, it's very dense, right?

866
01:51:52,870 --> 01:52:03,700
A lot of mercury that purposefully is volatile icing right in your face and, you know, to anybody who's in close proximity.

867
01:52:03,700 --> 01:52:09,370
So in that case, it's inhalation of massive amounts of mercury.

868
01:52:09,370 --> 01:52:22,720
So, right, so and everything in between, right, in terms of those, you know, kind of health education objectives.

869
01:52:22,720 --> 01:52:31,700
Any other comments, questions or observations?

870
01:52:31,700 --> 01:52:37,010
All right, well, hey, thanks so much for your attention and thanks for coming for good questions with the Dr. Brown.

871
01:52:37,010 --> 01:52:44,930
I really appreciate it. Have a good rest of your week. Health report important matters that have is a pretty good phrase.

872
01:52:44,930 --> 01:52:53,360
Hello. No, I better. I was like, How do you make people care what it's like not to?

873
01:52:53,360 --> 01:52:59,761
And so I was like, I feel like you got to have this challenge. And I also I'm going to others about exports and.
