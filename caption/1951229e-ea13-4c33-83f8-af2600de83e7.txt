1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:08,709
All right, guys, let's go ahead and get started. So today we're going to be talking about sort of an overview of cancer prevention.

2
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:11,750
So this is sort of a road map to where we're going next to this class.

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:19,030
So we've kind of talked about, you know, some of the basics of cancer statistics where we get them from trying to access those.

4
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,870
We've learned a bit about epidemiologic study design and also the biology of cancer.

5
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:27,190
Right. And now we're going to move into sort of the prevention of it.

6
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:33,129
And we're going to walk through thinking about this with a cancer that I'm very familiar with, prostate cancer.

7
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:34,120
I've done a lot of work on that.

8
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:41,810
And really, this is kind of the process that I want you guys to be thinking about doing in your groups with your individual cancers.

9
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:49,870
All right. So we're going to sort of do this one as an example, but this is really what what the what the point kind of of the project is.

10
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:53,469
So we've all seen this, right? The prevention triangle.

11
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:59,050
We've got primary prevention where you really try and prevent prevent initial development of the disease.

12
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:01,270
Right. Secondary prevention,

13
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:08,560
which is early detection of existing disease to reduce the severity of the disease and complications and make treatment hopefully more effective.

14
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:13,540
Right. And then we have tertiary prevention, which is reducing the impact of the disease.

15
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:19,510
That could be treatment. It could be trying to improve quality of life in survivors, that kind of thing.

16
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:26,190
All right. Specifically with respect to cancer.

17
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:31,280
Primary prevention usually means elimination or reduction of the agents causing cancer.

18
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:37,860
So in order to effectively conduct primary prevention, you need to know what's causing the cancer, right?

19
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,629
Secondary prevention is screening discovery of cancer at an early stage,

20
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:49,750
and then tertiary prevention is treatment, survivorship, rehabilitation and palliative care.

21
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:58,120
Right. So in our upcoming lectures, we're going to do some I'm going to talk about some aspects of primary prevention.

22
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:03,190
We're going to talk about some of the major risk factors smoking, diet and obesity and infection.

23
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:09,010
I'm going to give a lecture on secondary prevention and screening.

24
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:15,910
We're also going to have sort of falling within secondary prevention and maybe, maybe tertiary prevention.

25
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,260
We're going to be talking with we're going to have our genetic counselor come speak with us.

26
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:23,830
And that could sort of fall into both of those, I suppose, right?

27
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:29,350
Because if you know more about your genetic background, you can alter your screening regimen.

28
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:38,380
Right, to to be more effective. You could maybe potentially you might try some primary prevention like some chemoprevention kind of agents,

29
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:43,989
or you might treat the cancer differently depending upon how, you know, knowing this genetic risk.

30
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:50,889
Right. So that sort of falls in all of them. And then we're going to have our surgeon, Steve Chen, come talk with us.

31
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:55,270
Dr. Chen is going to talk with us about some of his work in having that cancer and

32
00:02:55,270 --> 00:03:02,950
sort of how difficult it is to do kind of that bench to bedside pipeline for drugs.

33
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:06,309
Right. I think a lot of you are really interested in cancer treatment.

34
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,780
A lot of you were treated very about school.

35
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:14,380
He has some cool pictures of the surgeries that he's done, which are, quite frankly, amazing, but also upsetting.

36
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:21,760
And also, he has you know, he does a lot of work in this area of like trying to bring a treatment to patients,

37
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,040
but it's actually much harder than you think.

38
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:30,730
And I think it's I think it's a good kind of reality check about how that process actually works and how terrible it is.

39
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:36,580
And, of course, we've been talking about disparities and social determinants, which are sort of embedded in a lot of this.

40
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:43,780
Right. We'll talk about that as we go through it. So I hope you guys will talk in the interactive.

41
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:47,320
I know it's early, but we're going to work through it together, hopefully.

42
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:58,390
Okay. So in order to conduct primary prevention, like I said, you really need to identify the modifiable risk factors for that disease.

43
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,420
And that's kind of where I do a lot of my work. I'm interested in modifiable risk factors for cancer.

44
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:09,700
So that's sort of where I sit. It's where a lot of epidemiologists sit.

45
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:16,500
Then you also want to, but you have to also identify the populations that are at high risk, right?

46
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:22,210
So you might intervene differently in different populations based on whether they're at high risk or if they have a high prevalence,

47
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:26,560
a particular risk factor. Right. That is where disparities research come in.

48
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:34,030
I do some of that. It's not my primary focus, but that is kind of where disparities, researchers really, really come into that equation.

49
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:38,860
And then once you kind of identify that, then you have to actually create interventions.

50
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:43,000
And that is an entire area unto itself.

51
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,440
Right? Clinicians will create interventions like drug interventions.

52
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,530
Right. And each kind of folks help behavior health,

53
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:55,780
education kind of folks will be doing a lot of more behavioral interventions, more kind of qualitative work.

54
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:02,649
And it's really important to tailor it about interventions to different especially high risk populations.

55
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:07,360
Right. This might be different racial groups of people from different cultural backgrounds.

56
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:13,090
And so this is where, again, our colleagues, epidemiologists do this, too,

57
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:17,890
but this is sort of where you learn that particular skill is doing that community based intervention,

58
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:22,300
working with communities, having these community partnerships.

59
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,560
Right. That's a big piece of what they do. Okay.

60
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:35,080
So just sort of the spectrum of where people like in the School of Public Health or in the public health world kind of set.

61
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:46,030
I would also add here, when you create interventions, there's a whole piece about whether it is cost effective,

62
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:50,470
whether it can actually be paid for by insurance companies, that kind of thing.

63
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:56,290
That, of course, is where our health policy and management folks join us in the process.

64
00:05:56,290 --> 00:06:03,530
Right. Whether whether this can actually be made into a policy of some kind that can really work for populations.

65
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:08,690
Right. So there's sort of all levels of this throughout. That's okay.

66
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:10,790
So let's do prostate cancer as an example.

67
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:16,099
So if we want to start thinking about primary prevention, there's a few different questions we need to ask ourselves.

68
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:21,140
So the first one is what are the risk and protective factors and are they modifiable?

69
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:31,440
So I'm going to start with three that are very well established and you can give me some more age.

70
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:38,760
Race and being male. So having a prostate in your body.

71
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:44,240
Or any of these modifiable? Nope.

72
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:50,509
And this is kind of the trouble with prostate cancer, is that these are the still the strongest risk factors and the most well-established.

73
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:53,570
Right. Most of the other ones are fairly modest.

74
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:57,470
And so it actually becomes difficult to do primary prevention for prostate cancer.

75
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,490
Yeah, but isn't the raise aspect more because of.

76
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:07,590
That is a good question. We're going to get to that. What is why race?

77
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:13,440
What does this mean? Because it can mean a lot of things, right? It can mean like social context.

78
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:20,550
Right. And that can be all the structural racism stuff. It can be access to care.

79
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:25,860
It can be so many different things. Right. So why is race associated with prostate cancer?

80
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:30,230
So it could be that could be genetics. Right.

81
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:42,920
What else could it be? Cultures that like different, like different cultural.

82
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:48,530
So what that kind of means is like different, different exposure to risk factors, right?

83
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:59,120
And protective factors. When I say risk factors, I'm only saying it in one direction.

84
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,180
But we're also all obviously interested in protective factors.

85
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:10,940
All right. So if these are the three biggies, what are some of those modifiable ones that we think might be associated with prostate cancer?

86
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:20,890
Yes. Good one. I always take the low hanging fruit.

87
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:29,850
I will tell you something that's a little confusing about prostate cancer is that if you look at all prostate cancer together,

88
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,299
a lot of these things don't really pop up as risk factors.

89
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:38,670
But that's because we're often including these cancers that are detected by PSA that actually are

90
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:43,470
kind of indolent and would not have progressed if we hadn't caught them with the screening test.

91
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:54,020
If you do a little bit of if you try to accurately, more accurately classify your outcome, we almost have information bias in our outcome.

92
00:08:54,030 --> 00:09:01,499
Right? We're always including things in our outcome definition that we use all prostate cancer that are clearly prostate cancer in the same way,

93
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:05,580
that are really clinically meaningful disease that would actually progress and cause problems.

94
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:09,839
When you try and you classify things with like more,

95
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:15,270
if you try to put the more aggressive cases separately, then you start to see these risk factors come up.

96
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:19,410
So we're going to talk about, you know, when we say that these are risk factors.

97
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:23,339
Don't become confused. If you ever read prostate cancer and like we didn't find anything,

98
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:28,260
then the first thing you should look at is whether they tried to look at aggressive or more clinically relevant disease separately.

99
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:32,610
And if they didn't, you can be like, well, that's why smoking.

100
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:36,590
What else? Tighten diet.

101
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:44,650
I'm going to put diet and body size and physical activity.

102
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:52,360
All kind of together because it's really difficult. We're going to talk about this in the in the Obesity Diet Lecture.

103
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:57,050
It's really hard to kind of disentangle these things from each other.

104
00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:04,240
Right. Certainly someone can be larger and have a very high quality diet.

105
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:06,910
Right. They can be larger and be physically active.

106
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:16,839
But on a population level, larger body size, poorer quality diet and less physical activity tend to track together.

107
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,989
And so it is actually really hard, particularly for a cancer study,

108
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:26,040
where you need large numbers of people in each of these groups to really see any relationship with cancer incidence.

109
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:35,080
It's really hard to like. Okay, what if we look at people with a BMI over 30 who work out every day and actually eat a lot of vegetables versus those?

110
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:42,549
Do you see that? I'm saying so it's really hard to like pick apart what is it that's actually about these

111
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:48,100
things that are kind of lumped in together that is actually causing a problem for cancer.

112
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:55,550
What else? Think of anything else.

113
00:10:57,050 --> 00:11:03,410
What was the other big one that we're going to have a lecture on? Yeah.

114
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,410
Yep. Diabetes is associated with prostate cancer.

115
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:11,530
It's a little bit confusing, but again, for the more clinically relevant diabetes seems to be a risk factor.

116
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:20,669
Infections. This is a little bit less well-established,

117
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:25,860
but there are there is some evidence that sexually transmitted infections can infect prostate and cause

118
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:30,750
inflammation and that there is some evidence that that may be associated with later risk of prostate cancer.

119
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:43,230
Maybe. Yeah. This is less well understood, but that's a good question.

120
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,630
Yes. Yeah. Yep. Alcohol.

121
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:56,180
Particularly for prostate cancer, binge drinking. For some cancers, it's like kind of a dose response.

122
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:59,239
Like the more you drink, the higher the risk. For prostate cancer.

123
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:05,030
It's kind of like not really. But if you drink, if you binge drink, then it seems to increase the risk.

124
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:14,540
It's hard to it's actually hard to study that because a lot of questionnaires ask about drinking, like how many drinks per week do you have?

125
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,340
And somebody might say, I have eight, right?

126
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,580
Which could be one glass of wine a day. Or it could be you go out on the weekend and binge drink on a Saturday night.

127
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:29,150
Right. And so on. Questionnaires where they can actually tell the difference between that.

128
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:38,200
It seems like the binge drinking behavior is more associated. Very much so.

129
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:43,060
Yep. Physical activity. It's in there. Yes. But you're right.

130
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:50,830
That's kind of the opposite of. And they're not necessarily they are independent for prostate cancer.

131
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:57,580
Right. They can't be independent. So if you are a person who sits all day at work and goes to the gym.

132
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:04,180
Hi, I hope it's me. Hi. Right, that is me. I don't have prostate, so I don't have to worry about this one particularly.

133
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:09,490
But this does translate to other cancers. It can be.

134
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:12,650
That can be a problem. Right. That does not negate the sitting. Right.

135
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:19,810
So like sedentary ness and activity are not necessarily just two sides of the same coin.

136
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:23,410
They can actually be independently associated.

137
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:26,469
And so there are people who there was a guy who studied physical activity when I worked at

138
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:31,240
NCI and he like believed this so hard that he had a desk and he would just walk all day.

139
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:37,750
I can't do that. I, I can't mouse and walk.

140
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:41,500
It's just impossible for me. I bought, like a little cycling thing for under my desk.

141
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:46,569
I still have a hard time using it if I'm trying to actually do any work, but it works for me.

142
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:50,800
Like in meetings I can at least a mouse like control the zoom while I'm pedaling my little thing.

143
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:55,330
So I try to do that. But yeah, he was like hardcore man.

144
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:58,390
He got the job and like a week or two before he started,

145
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:03,999
like these guys came in with this giant box and they were all like, Oh, what's happening in that office?

146
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:10,090
And set up a desk and he walks every day. What else?

147
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:15,220
Something. I study micronutrients.

148
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:22,100
There's a lot of hubbub about maybe vitamin E selenium.

149
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:29,440
They've done some trials on this. It's a little bit murky, still vitamin D, a little bit murky.

150
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:38,260
People are interested in it, though. I will also say, like statins is another thing that I study with prostate cancer.

151
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:45,940
So statins are cholesterol lowering drugs. They actually seem to be there is actually a growing consensus that stop medications and especially

152
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:50,110
longer duration use of that medication seems to be protective for horse prostate cancer.

153
00:14:52,250 --> 00:15:04,300
So that's pretty cool. Other common medications have been thought about too, like aspirin and says metformin.

154
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:11,490
Which goes along with diabetes, that's the diabetes medication.

155
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:16,989
So that becomes tricky, right? Because if you think that the disease itself might be associated with prostate cancer,

156
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:24,819
then you have this confusion about does the medication to treat the disease independently do anything to the cancer,

157
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,649
or is it somehow just treating the disease?

158
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:41,170
That's it's a chicken egg mess, but fun to kind of try to sort out, if that should be, I think anything else anybody wants to think of.

159
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:48,899
Okay. So we have this long list of things that are modifiable.

160
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:56,040
But I've told you that most of these are only sort of modestly associated or kind of just a little bit of an association.

161
00:15:57,150 --> 00:16:03,389
There's no huge smoking gun. Like, can we think of some some cancers where there's like one or two really big risk factors and it's

162
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:08,910
very clear that we could intervene on those and really cut down on a big portion of this cancer.

163
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Smoking lung cancer. Absolutely right.

164
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:19,230
Smoking gun. It's the smoking. Smoking exclusion. Sorry.

165
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:23,559
Crack myself up at 930 in the morning. Yes, absolutely.

166
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:27,400
If you get rid of that one risk factor, you would get rid of a huge chunk of that cancer.

167
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:35,500
Yeah, absolutely. HPV and cervical cancer, if you can get everybody to get the vaccine and no one is getting HPV anymore.

168
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:38,800
You got no more cervical cancer, right? So that's much clearer.

169
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:45,310
Primary prevention for prostate cancer is a little bit muddier. Most of these things would be good to do anyway.

170
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:49,420
Right. So, you know, don't smoke.

171
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:53,650
Try to maintain a healthy diet and some physical activity.

172
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:57,910
So hopefully you don't get diabetes. Treat your diabetes if you have it.

173
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,889
Like, all of these things are good for a lot of reasons,

174
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:06,310
but it's hard to make a case for like intervening on any one of them, particularly two, to stop prostate cancer.

175
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:12,670
How about populations that are most at risk or have the greatest exposure to these risk factors?

176
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:22,850
Is there a very important first of all, is there an important disparity for this cancer that you know of?

177
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:30,170
Black men are 2 to 3 times more likely to get prostate cancer and to die of prostate cancer.

178
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:38,930
So there is a very important racial disparity for this cancer. So that begs the question, are any of these risk factors much more common in black men?

179
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:45,080
So maybe there is a smoking gun in that population. Maybe in that population, there's something we could really intervene on.

180
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:49,610
Right. This is not about black men.

181
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:53,300
But cigaret use is actually higher in Arab Americans.

182
00:17:53,600 --> 00:18:00,650
Right. And so this is something maybe this is a population where intervening on smoking particularly might be of use.

183
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:04,520
Right. Smoking is also higher in black Americans.

184
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:16,010
So maybe there needs to be some particular culturally appropriate, community based interventions to get people to stop smoking.

185
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:26,060
People have also talked about and it's not mentioned in the study, but people in the Arab American population in particular, there is hookah smoking.

186
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:29,960
Right. And that is something that is probably also not great for you.

187
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:33,590
It hasn't been studied a lot, at least in the U.S.

188
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:40,460
Right. But I can guarantee you that any kind of inhaling of combusted material is probably not fantastic for your lungs.

189
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:48,739
So, you know, but that is, again, like a cultural thing that would need people who are in that community,

190
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:53,809
who are familiar with the culture to target appropriate interventions.

191
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:58,610
Right. You can't just have a bunch of like white people working university admission being like,

192
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:02,660
you shouldn't smoke to get like that is not going to work, right? Absolutely not.

193
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:07,969
So that's where community partnerships, people who design these like community based interventions,

194
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:15,830
these culturally appropriate interventions really come in. Partnering with community partners, you know, that kind of thing.

195
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:25,409
So this is something that I actually did. So we looked at longer term, it says lipid lowering drug use,

196
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:33,390
but it is predominantly statin use and risk of incident and fatal prostate cancer and black and white matter in this study, the Eric study.

197
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:37,770
So most of the work that had been done before where I told you there's this sort

198
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:41,790
of growing consensus that statins appear to protect against prostate cancer,

199
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:45,989
particularly bad prostate cancer had looked not specifically at fatal disease,

200
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:49,860
which is kind of the most it's most clinically relevant outcome, really.

201
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,860
Right. That's the hardest outcome you can look at.

202
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:57,600
But it's hard to do for prostate cancer because fortunately, not that many not that many men die of prostate cancer.

203
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:02,940
Right. It's actually kind of a rare outcome. So it becomes difficult to study even though we really want to study it.

204
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:08,040
And what really hasn't been done is looking at this separately in black, black and white men,

205
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:13,290
we don't have a particular reason to think that statins would operate differently in black and white men.

206
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:19,710
But it's important to look right. It's important to have the data and to be able to say, yeah, it actually protects in both of these groups.

207
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:24,569
Because I will tell you that there is population level data to suggest that

208
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:28,140
black men are less likely to take a step if they are indicated for black white.

209
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:35,639
Now, I'm not saying that this explains the whole disparity in prostate cancer, but it could knock off a piece of it.

210
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:40,620
Right. If you could bring up the level of stop use if statins really are protecting against bad disease.

211
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:43,680
We know the black men use them less than they should.

212
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:50,640
If we can bring that level up to the same level as white men, you might start to make that right, might knock off a little piece of the disparity.

213
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:56,040
So we actually found that it was the same protective in both black and white men.

214
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:04,150
So that was pretty great. We also I thought this was a pretty cool paper that we did.

215
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:08,830
So this was an MPH students. This is the work that she did.

216
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:15,970
Cali did for her, for her illy project, for her mph and so we looked in and Haynes at.

217
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:20,799
So I told you that one of the things okay so there's this disparity, right?

218
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:27,790
You've got a disparity of black and white men. We have these all of these risk factors that are sort of have this modest association.

219
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:35,139
What if like if you added them up, on average, black men have kind of a worse profile for kind of all of these things.

220
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:38,440
What if that could explain the difference we see?

221
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:42,850
Right. It's not any one of the things, but kind of taken all together,

222
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:48,010
maybe kind of the average profile is worse in black men and that could maybe explain the difference.

223
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:52,510
It turns out that is not the answer we actually found.

224
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:57,010
And I will go here. I'll go to this. We go real quick to I'll show you some.

225
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:12,270
Actual data because I think it's cool. So we actually created a risk score.

226
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:17,430
So for these are all of the different things that we looked at by race and then Heinz.

227
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:27,960
So we looked at all kinds of different risk factors, both those that are really established and those that were less established.

228
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:31,620
Right. So we looked at various dietary things. We looked at lots of laboratory measurements,

229
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:36,029
kind of anything that a couple of papers that maybe looked at and found that it might be associated with.

230
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:45,999
We looked at that by race. But then for the things that have been associated for which there is a relative risk estimate from a meta analysis.

231
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:53,790
So what, more than a few papers have been published on it and they've got some sort of like average over these studies,

232
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:58,049
kind of relative risk estimate for these risk factors.

233
00:22:58,050 --> 00:23:07,709
We created a score so we kind of said, okay, let's say smoking risk is like 1.5 for the highest level of smoking.

234
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:12,420
So we're going to create a score where we take the levels of smoking and multiply the highest one by 1.5.

235
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:17,670
And then we so we had a weighted each of these factors by the is the strength of the association of

236
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:23,400
Prostate Cancer and then kind of added them up for each person and looked at the average by race.

237
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:28,550
So what we actually found, if we look, we can actually look back at the.

238
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:33,820
No. Yeah. So if you look at the risk score.

239
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,900
It's actually not that that's not the right table.

240
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:45,860
That's why I notice if you look at these risk scores, what we found is that this is non-Hispanic whites,

241
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:50,210
not Hispanic blacks, Mexican-Americans born in the US and Mexican-Americans not born in the U.S.

242
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:53,930
The thing to note here is that Hispanic men actually have a lower risk of prostate cancer.

243
00:23:54,530 --> 00:24:00,259
So what we found is that compared to white men, Mexican to Mexican American men,

244
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:05,270
both those born in and out of the U.S. were more or less likely to have a high risk score.

245
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:11,440
So they had sort of lower risk profiles, which makes sense because they have a lower risk of prostate cancer.

246
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:21,790
So the kind of a lower average risk score profile in Mexican American men might explain why they have a lower risk generally of prostate cancer.

247
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:25,990
But look at this. We found the same thing for black men.

248
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:30,490
They actually have a lower average risk profile based on these risk factors.

249
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,160
They have lower risk factor profiles than white men.

250
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:42,680
So if it's not their modifiable risk factors that is causing their higher risk, what else could it be?

251
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:46,790
Keep in mind, we're looking at kind of like lifestyle risk factors here.

252
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:53,260
Right. So it doesn't seem to be this.

253
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:57,820
Right. It's not this these cultural differences.

254
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:03,850
So it kind of could be genetics or it could be like social contacts and stuff that we didn't take into.

255
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:15,020
Which is harder to intervene on. Right? So if we go back to our thing, we are talking about potential routes for primary prevention.

256
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:23,370
We've got these risk factors. It turns out black people are not actually they don't actually have the greatest exposure to these risk factors.

257
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:31,469
But despite that, they seem to have the highest risk. So you can't really intervene on these modifiable risk factors and expect to have

258
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:36,120
a strong impact on the disparity between white and black men and prostate cancer.

259
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,300
Right. That might not be the right answer.

260
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:45,600
So if you guys were looking at your like what is kind of this avenue of new research that's really going to have an impact?

261
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:49,990
That might not be it. Yes. Stress or anxiety.

262
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:55,910
I would, yes. That is absolutely something we didn't look at.

263
00:25:55,920 --> 00:26:01,840
I would think that that is in part due to like social context kind of stuff in this case.

264
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:09,509
Right. And a lot of studies have looked at like stress hormones and experience of stigma or discrimination and

265
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:15,810
found that people who report experiencing that have higher kind of general biological stress responses.

266
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:24,720
So absolutely, that is a thing. It's just that well, I think it's a noble goal and we should all be working to address systemic racism.

267
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:33,750
It's not really something you can. Tell a person to do two affects their risk of prostate cancer.

268
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:36,980
Right? Like it's important to know those things.

269
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:40,440
It's important to demonstrate that they impact health. It's important to work on them.

270
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:49,950
But it's not like a like a distinct recommendation that you can make to a person about what to do about their risk for this disease.

271
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:56,860
Right. Okay.

272
00:26:57,310 --> 00:27:00,250
So primary prevention might not be the answer for prostate cancer.

273
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:03,760
In your cancer that you're working on, you might find something totally different, right?

274
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:08,020
There are certainly cancers where primary prevention is very obviously the answer.

275
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:15,640
So let's move on now to what about secondary prevention?

276
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:24,730
If we think that either of these things is the real driver behind this racial disparity,

277
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:32,890
it might be appropriate to tell black men to get screened more often or more or earlier or more aggressively in some way than white men.

278
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:40,930
Right. That might be the answer. Or the the the immediate answer and an immediate solution to the problem.

279
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:44,440
Right. You guys agree with that?

280
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:52,140
All right. So here's our question. Is there a screening test for this cancer?

281
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:59,840
Yes. What is it? Yes, a PSA. Could it be better?

282
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:05,240
Yes, absolutely right. Because this is over diagnosing a lot of men.

283
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:09,950
It's not really a screening test for clinically relevant prostate cancer.

284
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:13,850
So we know we're not always finding the most relevant cases.

285
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:17,830
It's on the fence. We're going to talk a lot about this when we get to the screening lecture.

286
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:21,410
And I have a prostate cancer lecture that I'm going to give, too, with a little more detail.

287
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:24,230
But, yeah, it's problematic. Right.

288
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:31,670
And so a lot of research is actually around trying to find kind of that holy grail of like a test that really picks out,

289
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:35,660
oh, this is a bad prostate cancer that needs intervention.

290
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:41,750
Right. In asymptomatic men. So yeah. And that is something people are working on.

291
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:45,200
And that could be an area of research if he were doing prostate cancer that you might say,

292
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,200
hey, this is a big area of research that people are really interested in. Right.

293
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:52,850
And it would have a really big public health impact if it were successful.

294
00:28:55,070 --> 00:29:01,730
So who should get screened? So this is often a science plus kind of a policy and cost kind of thing.

295
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:08,990
And this is where you might say that black men should get screened earlier or more frequently than white men,

296
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:14,750
or perhaps that there should be different PSA thresholds for intervention in black men, maybe.

297
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:22,190
So there's lots of ways that you could tailor a screening test generally to a more high risk group.

298
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:28,820
Right. And what populations have the lowest screening rates and do we know why?

299
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:37,080
And then how could you? And you need to know this. If you want to intervene to increase the utilization of screening rate,

300
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:41,880
you need to know which which groups are not using it and then why they're not using it.

301
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:48,750
And that could be a combination of like just figuring out which groups have the lowest screening rates, could be an epidemiologic study,

302
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:53,220
but then you might again have sort of a behavioral group do like a focus group,

303
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:57,540
like a qualitative research study with these people and ask, why are you not getting screened right?

304
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:05,070
So this is a study that came out in 2017 from the Southern Community Cohort Study, which I think I've mentioned before,

305
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:09,240
is a big cancer cohort that was started in the early 2000 and is now kind of maturing.

306
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:14,010
And they, by design, included a large number of African-American participants.

307
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:20,790
And so their conclusion from the study is that greater PSA testing, there was greater PSA testing in white versus black men.

308
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:28,200
And this was much it was really mainly a consequence of socioeconomic status.

309
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:34,319
So it was kind of this this intersection between race and access.

310
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:42,420
It wasn't really the aspect of race that was sort of driving this racial disparity was the difference.

311
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:51,440
Right? So that really tells you what that gives you some idea.

312
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:55,440
What are some ideas for intervention then if it's if it's socioeconomic status or if it's money,

313
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:58,920
if not having money or not being able to get to the doctor is the problem.

314
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:04,260
What might you do? Yeah.

315
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:07,680
Subsidized. Yeah. You could subsidize screening.

316
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:16,000
You could have, like, free screening clinics. You'd like drive up a bus with a botanist in it to these communities.

317
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:19,840
You can like mobile screening days or something at a community center.

318
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:26,140
Something like that. I mean, this this opens up.

319
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:35,930
The fact that it seems to be driven is there that gives you some answers about what what the intervention might be.

320
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:45,679
Right. And this is an example about the this is this is the kind of paper or the kind of research

321
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:51,470
that might be done to try to determine whether screening is actually cost effective.

322
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:59,000
So and it's kind of, again, a little bit of a mess with with PSA screening, right.

323
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:02,180
Because you are over treating a lot of men with it.

324
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:08,510
So part of the issue with the PSA screening is that you're you're diagnosing over treating, which is not good for people.

325
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:14,960
It's also not cost effective. Right. So this is part of the decision making.

326
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:23,960
All right. What about tertiary prevention for prostate cancer? Is there an effective treatment?

327
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:32,810
You say? Yes. What is it? You know. Surgery.

328
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:35,970
Yeah. Prostatectomy. Particularly if it's early. Right.

329
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:41,759
So the treatment always kind of changes depending upon when and when you're diagnosed, right?

330
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:45,360
So like early, we've got prostatectomy.

331
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:52,630
And then a little bit later. Anybody now?

332
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:09,120
We've got brachytherapy. Which is like localized radiation therapy where they take radioactive seeds and actually kind of implant

333
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:13,980
them under the skin of the paradigm so that it's radiating the prostate kind of low level continuously.

334
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:18,810
And that's done usually a little bit later if surgery isn't an option for whatever reason.

335
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:25,500
And then we have a bunch of drugs for like metastatic or like castrate resistant.

336
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:37,570
So the first line of drugs is usually a drug that knocks down testosterone because testosterone is necessary for the cancer to grow.

337
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:42,130
So in later, later stages, they'll be like, okay, we're going to give you this drug.

338
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:46,150
But then the tumor will eventually find a way around that sort of thing, its own.

339
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:52,090
Testosterone. And that's called castrate resistant prostate cancer.

340
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:56,970
And so that is more end stage and then there's more drugs, right?

341
00:33:56,980 --> 00:34:02,530
So there's actually been some pretty significant improvements in like drugs and toward the end

342
00:34:02,530 --> 00:34:06,590
of prostate cancer to kind of keep talking on the next one to get a couple more years out of it.

343
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:12,650
Right. But, you know, could there be better therapies here, particularly for early disease?

344
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:16,299
Let's think about that. Why? What's wrong with prostatectomy?

345
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:27,620
Do we know? Big time.

346
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:32,590
Yes. Most men have some degree of urinary incontinence after prostatectomy.

347
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:35,650
That often gets better over time.

348
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:39,910
But most men also have some degree of sexual dysfunction that does not improve.

349
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:44,680
I do it also with any surgery, like something that can take off work.

350
00:34:46,430 --> 00:34:51,730
We just decided not to get it because of. Yes.

351
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:56,510
Yes. So people have actually worked on theirs.

352
00:34:57,310 --> 00:35:02,740
I don't think it has panned out, but people are very clever in trying to treat these things.

353
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:08,860
They came up with radiofrequency ablation where you kind of use these like high radiofrequency waves that can be very, very targeted.

354
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:15,250
And in fact, I think they were working on this album sometime ago because I remember going to a prostate cancer meeting and they

355
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:20,829
showed like a picture of like a microscopic picture of a prostate where they would think it was like a dog prostate.

356
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:23,920
Right. It wasn't a person, but they had done like they had worked on.

357
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:27,519
Whatever reason, dogs are actually the animal model that they use for prostate cancer.

358
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:31,929
So don't come at me. I didn't I didn't come up with that. But they had actually,

359
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:42,430
like drawn like a little black m in the prostate tissue with their tool to like demonstrate that it was very precise and that they could.

360
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:52,710
So that would be really cool if it actually worked to prevent recurrence, if you had a good outcome from it.

361
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:57,160
Right. Because you could actually target the exact spots of cancer in the prostate and you wouldn't

362
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:59,530
have to take the whole thing out and then you wouldn't have all these side effects.

363
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:06,840
I don't think it has panned out to be actually that effective, but these are the kinds of things that people are trying to think of.

364
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:11,829
Right. So absolutely. This is an area where we could have a lot of improvement.

365
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:16,360
Right. We could have we could have a much better kind of treatment for this early disease that

366
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:20,360
doesn't have all the side effects that a prostatectomy does and that might be more accessible.

367
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:24,290
Absolutely. Are there barriers to receiving effective treatment?

368
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:27,610
You just named one has to be.

369
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:30,940
I mean, it's expensive surgery and cancer treatment is always expensive.

370
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:35,710
So, yes, lower US populations are definitely less likely to receive treatment.

371
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:42,580
Right. And the drugs I talked about at the end, I think I brought this up briefly in some other context.

372
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:45,490
But like I think it was one of the news articles you guys were talking about.

373
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:54,670
But like inpatient chemotherapy is billed as a procedure, I believe, and then drugs are billed as prescription drugs.

374
00:36:55,390 --> 00:37:01,240
So the co-pays for prescription drugs, even if it's the same exact drug or even if the oral medication is better,

375
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:06,700
it's extremely difficult for patients to get it sometimes because there's a huge out-of-pocket costs.

376
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:14,620
There's usually like a big cap, like a cap on prescription. How much health plans, even good ones, will cover four prescriptions in a year, right?

377
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:22,569
Whereas the inpatient stuff, they just pay for it. So sometimes I have heard doctors say that they have patients that they

378
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:25,480
prescribe the inpatient stuff for because they know they cannot afford the drug,

379
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:30,790
even if like given any other circumstance, they would probably have prescribed the drug.

380
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:36,459
And then they could stay home. They wouldn't have to like come into the infusion clinic.

381
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:40,270
Right? So that would actually be way more convenient. It might actually be a better drug for them.

382
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:44,410
But it's it's just paid for differently. Is it's stupid.

383
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:49,720
It's stupid. It's stupid. Um, you know,

384
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:55,840
are there recommendations for lifestyle changes in Survivor so that we have to kind of go back to this list or something

385
00:37:55,840 --> 00:38:03,129
like it and think about are there modifiable things that people can do to actually improve their survival after diagnosis?

386
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:09,400
That's something that I also study, right? I'm in this modifiable risk factor world, particularly with statins.

387
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:14,050
I mean, how cool would it be if a guy gets diagnosed with prostate cancer? You're like, actually, go ahead and take this step.

388
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:19,240
It's FDA approved, really safe. Very few people have serious side effects with it.

389
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:27,249
It'll also help your cardiovascular disease risk. Go ahead and take it. And if you gave it to people at diagnosis as an adjuvant, you know,

390
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:31,570
in addition to everything else that they're actually doing for their cancer, would that improve their outcomes?

391
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:35,050
That be super cool, wouldn't it? People are looking at that.

392
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:40,680
Or like should we be recommending that people take vitamins?

393
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:46,740
Should we be recommending that people lose weight or improve their diet or eat or vegetables or do physical activity?

394
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:52,080
Certainly tell them not to smoke. But, you know, sometimes limited success.

395
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:56,700
But yeah. I mean, should you avoid alcohol after you've had prostate cancer?

396
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:02,429
Right. There's all of these things that you could maybe that might prevent disease in the first place,

397
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:08,550
but also might improve quality of life or improve outcomes if they started adopting them after after.

398
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:14,530
And I will tell you that people are very motivated. Right. Like people who wouldn't have made these lifestyle changes before.

399
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:18,210
Once they get a cancer diagnosis are much more motivated and many of them will do it.

400
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:26,790
And then are their quality of life issues for survivors. I mean, with prostate cancer.

401
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:32,310
Absolutely right. There's all kinds of sexual side effects and that is a huge problem.

402
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:38,640
Urinary incontinence is also not great. You can also have with brachytherapy, you can have urinary but also fecal incontinence.

403
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:46,020
And so, I mean, all of this is not fantastic.

404
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:53,699
Right. And so all of that can be mediated and with other you know, there can be, you know,

405
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:58,079
with head and neck cancer, for example, the quality of life issues are humongous, right?

406
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:01,500
Because we think of head and neck as being like people like brain.

407
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:05,010
But it's really more like your face and your mouth, right?

408
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:09,090
You're talking about oral cancer, anything from the vermillion surface of the lip all the way down through the throat.

409
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:14,310
So that's what you present to the world is how you interact, you talk, you eat.

410
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:24,209
I mean, eating is so social. Right. And being unable to eat, being unable to chew and swallow, being unable to speak are huge quality of life issues.

411
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:27,870
Right. So there's a big area there as well.

412
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:36,629
All right. So with prostate cancer, Daniela Wittmann is a professor here in the Department of Urology.

413
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:39,930
She studies sexual rehabilitation in men.

414
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:44,970
And after prostate cancer, she's designed a bunch of interventions working with, like, couples.

415
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:51,839
So she started working with heterosexual couples and then moved on to men who

416
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:56,639
are in relationships with men or who are single and working with the couple

417
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:06,870
together to kind of manage expectations and to talk about what would actually need to be done to achieve sexual rehabilitation after the surgery.

418
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:11,340
It has been really important, right, and really helpful, like people's perception.

419
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:16,320
I think if people go into it thinking that everything is going to be exactly the same afterwards,

420
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:22,260
it's much harder than if they're told ahead of time it's not going to be exactly the same.

421
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:28,800
Here's how it will be different. But these are the things that you can do as a couple to improve it, if that's something that's important to you.

422
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:35,880
Right. And kind of having them go through this together and having the partner also be educated about it is really, really helpful.

423
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:41,130
So her work, I think, is really, really important and pretty cool.

424
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:50,570
Anxiety, fatigue, depression, I mean, kind of any cancer.

425
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:52,310
These are a problem, right?

426
00:41:54,110 --> 00:42:01,999
Any cancer you have, you think you're better, but you go in for these scans and I'm sure that must be a huge source of anxiety,

427
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:07,490
not only for the patient, but for the family. Right, as they go to check on the progress and how things are going.

428
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:14,950
You know, and a lot of this is exacerbated by some of that financial toxicity that we talked about.

429
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:22,370
Right. You might be anxious about your cancer coming back, but like maybe you can't work anymore.

430
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:27,620
Maybe you are really worried about money now.

431
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:34,010
Right. All of those things are huge. And fatigue is a real thing.

432
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:37,630
And also a chemo brain, like people used to say it as if it were kind of a joke.

433
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:41,060
And they've actually done studies. Chemo brain is a real thing. Who's heard of chemo brain?

434
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:50,120
I mean, it's kind of like this, this mental fog, almost like, you know, just just forgetfulness,

435
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:55,370
not really being able to focus quite the same way, just feeling like you're not mentally 100% right.

436
00:42:55,370 --> 00:42:58,700
And they've actually shown that that's a real thing that happens to chemotherapy patients.

437
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:05,450
Okay. So this kind of thing is exactly what you're going to do in your groups, right?

438
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:14,120
I hope this has been helpful in showing you kind of the questions that you ask and how you walk through it and how you then use that information.

439
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:16,040
And for different cancers, it will be different.

440
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:21,770
What the right point of intervention is or what the most fruitful point of intervention is likely to be.

441
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:27,620
And that is probably where you're going to find the most interesting current research that's going on, right?

442
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:32,240
If you can kind of walk through these steps for your cancer and be like, Oh,

443
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:39,200
I think this is kind of where where, you know, the low hanging fruit really is for this cancer.

444
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:43,700
So I bet people are really working on that. That's where you're going to find some cool stuff that people are doing.

445
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:52,479
Does that make sense? All right. So we have a little bit of time if you guys want if you've sparked some ideas and you'd like to

446
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:56,799
get into your groups now and maybe think through some of this or maybe like make a little plan,

447
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:03,640
that'll be part of your outline. I think that would be really a good use of the next half hour or so.

448
00:44:04,090 --> 00:44:04,630
That sounds good.

449
00:44:06,490 --> 00:44:12,550
Okay, quick break and then we'll get into our groups and you guys can all come around and help you think through some of this stuff if you'd like.
