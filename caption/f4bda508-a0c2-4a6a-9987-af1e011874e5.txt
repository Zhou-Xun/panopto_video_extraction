1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,660
It was like something incredulously, like, literally, you know.

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:10,770
Okay. All right. So like I said, today, we're going to start with glucose metabolism.

3
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:14,190
So the next six or seven lectures are all going to be related to glucose metabolism.

4
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:22,990
So just a reminder, if you didn't notice the email, for those of you in nutrition 60 days, it's not physically here on you.

5
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:32,760
I want you to stay here and watch it here. I think we're going to be putting it up there.

6
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:35,910
No, it won't be even set up. So if you want to watch on your laptop in here, that's fine.

7
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:39,360
It's not going to be okay.

8
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,950
So those are learning objectives. So so there's a really general overview here.

9
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:47,620
This is really, really, really hard on both protein bars and carbohydrates.

10
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:53,459
They're all going to get broken down to their constituent products for metabolism, lots of monosaccharides with strong fatty acids,

11
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,180
and then they're all going to feed into some part of either glycolysis or the case cycle.

12
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:04,829
So we're going to walk through all of this in a lot more detail. So I'm going to show this diagram several times over the course of the semester.

13
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:10,020
So it's going to look pretty complicated now, but we're going to go through this sort of piece by piece.

14
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:14,960
Of course, today we're going to focus on glycolysis, which is this piece here, and they're going to have to cycle.

15
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:20,820
So we're here on Monday, right? So I find this diagram is sort of nice because it has everything important in it.

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:28,060
It also sort of helps orient. So if you're not sure where things are, this is a good way to sort of be like where are we relative to us to look for?

17
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:34,320
And also of course, knowing whether or not we can oxidize glucose effectively oxidize, stored,

18
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,299
transferred glucose effectively in our blood is really the underlying pathology for type two diabetes

19
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:46,710
again is characterized by either a fasting blood glucose or elevated GDP or chronic glycation of skin.

20
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:54,209
So really today what we're focusing on mostly is the postprandial disposal of nutrients, what happens to glucose after we consume it?

21
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:59,540
And then how is this group here where there's normal disposal different from from that group?

22
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:06,150
So things get a little simpler relative to digestion once sugars are inside our bodies.

23
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:10,650
So for example, there's only the only monosaccharides that can get into our blood are glucose.

24
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,540
So unless something has gone pretty raw, there's no lactose to worry about,

25
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:19,739
there's no fiber to worry about, there's no third story about, there's no sucrose to worry about.

26
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,270
You only have these three monosaccharides.

27
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:27,360
So our body, once you're inside the blood, our body just has to deal with those three substances so it doesn't have to be nearly two of us.

28
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:31,410
There's really four things that can happen, right? So we already talked about glucose absorption in the gut.

29
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:37,860
We're going to talk about glucose production and glucose storage in the glycogen company of Genesis lectures.

30
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:40,710
So what we're going to focus on today are point three and point four.

31
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:47,240
So glucose could just be two spokes and by the supposed, I mean it can be used or stored fructose and galactose can only be used.

32
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:54,090
They cannot be stored. Right? And so all three of these are going to be that there is no fructose or galactose production.

33
00:02:54,090 --> 00:03:01,440
And no, because of this story, if you look at where the glucose goes in a control person.

34
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,969
So no diabetic person, the vast, vast, vast majority of postprandial.

35
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:11,840
So I mean, after a meal or in response to insulin, glucose disposal occurs in the muscle like the banks.

36
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:17,100
That's my theory. So you can see how little goes into the adipose tissue and how little goes into the brain.

37
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:22,360
And then the various spinal cord equals equally, the vast majority goes into muscle, right?

38
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:27,990
So when we're talking about glucose disposal effectively, we're talking about the muscles ability to dispose of themselves.

39
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:31,860
Right. We're going to talk a little bit about the liver today, but most of this is happening in muscle.

40
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,489
The other thing I want you to get from the slide is that if you compare for somebody who has

41
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:40,140
type two diabetes to control the brain blood glucose flux and its blank blood glucose flux,

42
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:44,640
and to some extent the adipose blood glucose flux are remarkably mostly unaffected.

43
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:48,620
The main thing that is affected is muscle glucose response, right?

44
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:53,340
So that is the key pathological thing for somebody who has impaired postprandial glucose

45
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:57,569
disposal is it's a muscle phenotype but doesn't mean it's always a problem with the muscle.

46
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:02,910
It could be the pancreas is really getting with the muscle or whatever, but it's primarily based on a lack of glucose disposal.

47
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:08,250
Even if the glucose doesn't get disposed in the muscle, it's going to stay in our blood.

48
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,790
And that's that's bad. And you'll see this for all macronutrients to talk about.

49
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:16,260
In general, we have a lot more glucose stored inside our cells than in our blood.

50
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,309
But it's the glucose is in the blood. It is tap water. So we have a lot more.

51
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:25,830
For example, if you took all the glucose molecules in somebody like you stores, that would be like 15 times more than the amount in their blood.

52
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:30,720
But the level of the blood. Right. That is the underlying problem for for both types of diabetes.

53
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:36,930
Okay. So getting it out of the blood into the cell is the first and most critical thing that we have to think about.

54
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:42,000
So the main way this happens is through the transporter called Group four.

55
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,940
And so I'm going to go through this a little bit briefly because it was in the notes.

56
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:49,620
This is confusing and it says a lot today if you need more detail combining.

57
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:57,260
And the main thing that happens is the glucose transporter is involved, adipose and muscle are generally not on the surface of the sun.

58
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:02,139
Right. They're generally stored inside the cell. That means these cells, muscle and fat effect,

59
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:08,410
normally cannot take up because there is no other transporters that are at high enough levels, so they are simply refractory.

60
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:13,120
So if there's no insulin and there's no exercise, those cells will ignore the glucose in the blood.

61
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:17,740
This won't even let them enter. Completely blocked off. Allow for glucose uptake.

62
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:21,429
What happens is these transporters move to the plasma membrane, right?

63
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:25,150
So there's a regulated process by which these transporters move to the membrane.

64
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:29,620
Once they're at the membrane now, glucose can flow down its concentration gradient into the.

65
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:32,830
So the exact same thing happens with exercise.

66
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:37,870
It's just the mechanisms are different. In the case of insulin, there's an insulin dependent series of steps that happen.

67
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:42,250
And then in the case of exercise, there's an ampk dependent series of steps that happen.

68
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:44,320
These are largely independent of each other.

69
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:49,450
That's why in the case of impaired glucose tolerance, you can still have an exercise induced glucose response.

70
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,400
So that's what I'm trying to reconfigure here.

71
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:58,720
Mark Figure You can ignore the difference between the dots and circles, but if you compare the two dark circles here,

72
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:04,990
these are people who are given the same amount of glucose but then had some post-meal exercise versus did not have to be exercise.

73
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:10,480
So you can see the presence of Post-Meal exercise here rapidly diminished the amount of blood glucose level.

74
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:17,590
That's because the energy demand in the muscle was driving through ampk the translocation of fluid for into the membranes.

75
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:20,920
Well, Lucy may seem a little bit of a weird, counterintuitive way,

76
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:28,240
but the goal here is you want a very rapid way for muscle cells to respond to insulin or exercise to allow for glucose uptake.

77
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:34,359
So by having these transporters ready and near the membrane, all you need to do is get them to the membrane so that can happen quite quickly as

78
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,540
opposed to sort of making transporters through whole cloth or something like that.

79
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:44,830
Would this be an example of why you recommend like going for a walk after like a really heavy meal?

80
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:49,090
I mean, a walk is different than a run, but just like getting up in the. Yeah.

81
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:55,090
For diabetes especially, just moving around can help with digestion just in terms of like moving food around in the first place.

82
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:58,660
But for people with diabetes especially, that's why they recommend that. And to be clear, it doesn't.

83
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:03,519
This type of exercise you're talking about here, this is on an ergonomic cycle because they were trying to be controlled here.

84
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,970
But it doesn't have to be super high intensity exercise. Right.

85
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:11,620
It can be a brisk walk for 15 or 20 minutes is usually sufficient to produce postprandial glucose excursions.

86
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:19,320
Okay. So to decide whether or not any individual cell is going to let glucose into it,

87
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:23,700
it's going to make a series of decisions like sort of by three, but there's actually four.

88
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:27,030
This one question is, are we going to let the sugar into the cell?

89
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:30,719
Right. So that's like glue for us, right? It glued four is on the membrane.

90
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:36,180
It's going to let the sugar into the cell. So that's a decision. The muscle cell would me should I have to form the membrane or not?

91
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:41,010
Once it's in the cell, they might make a decision about should we trap the sugar in the cell?

92
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:45,510
And by trapping what I mean is by protein or by false for letting the sugar.

93
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:49,430
What's a sugar? It's phosphorylated in general. It is now trapped inside the cell.

94
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,460
It can't get back out into the blood. And so let's second decision.

95
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:59,160
Am I going to go to the next step? Then once it's phosphorylated, you can decide, are you going to do sort of more for the metabolism in this case,

96
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:04,410
converting it into the pyruvate or lactate through the costs?

97
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:09,260
And then the fourth decision is, should I take that glucose and turn out the question, which will I get something now?

98
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:10,139
It's actually going to turn out.

99
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:18,030
These are different for all the sugars and for liver and fat compared to muscle sorry, muscle and fat compared to liver, pancreas and break.

100
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:24,150
In the case of muscle and fat, you're controlling entrance, right?

101
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:29,520
So you're gaining at the level of entry into the cell, but you generally are not controlling whether it's phosphorylated.

102
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:34,260
You basically, once you let it into the cell, you're always going to phosphorylated like a liver,

103
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:41,610
pancreas and brain cell is almost always going to allow entry, but it's only going to phosphorylated if the concentration gets to a certain point.

104
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:46,050
And I'll talk about what I mean by that in a minute. The Catabolism will get to you later.

105
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:49,350
Okay. Catabolism is also different between non galactose and fruit.

106
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:54,750
Those are almost always never regulated at the level of entry or at the level of phosphorylation.

107
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:59,400
They get to assault, they get into the cell, they get phosphorylated. There's affectively no control of that.

108
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,260
The cell sees the virtuosity, lot goes phosphorylated. Let's add it.

109
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:09,240
Let's get into the cell phosphorylated and then continues on. And so that's a big distinction between glucose and galactose.

110
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:15,890
Once we process it, we're going to undergo the pathway glycolysis where the end product is going to be is going to be part of it.

111
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:23,760
Okay. So I'm going to start with the phosphorylation stuff. So here are the four kinases that can tolerate glucose produced with lactose.

112
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,559
You'll notice there's two different ones for glucose and one for lactose.

113
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:34,470
Paxos You can see here the Kim Hills constant here is much higher for glucose.

114
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:37,830
So for those of you who aren't familiar with cams or biochemistry,

115
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:45,239
what that means is this only works at 50% maximal activity when the concentration rises to ten.

116
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:51,180
MILLER Okay. So that means you have to have a very high concentration of glucose for glucose needs to be effective.

117
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:58,140
On the other hand, these three here Hexo plays the fruit because in black those kinases they work in a much lower affinity.

118
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:01,740
So what that means is they're going to work almost all the time, right?

119
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:06,090
So basically at very low levels of these sugars, they're always going to phosphorylated, right?

120
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,890
So they're not going to only do it at certain times are almost always going to do it because these concentrations are,

121
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:14,970
you know, 100 or 200 fold lower than the key M for glucagon.

122
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:20,340
And so that's one really, really big difference. The phosphorylation, like I said, is important.

123
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:26,100
It charges the monosaccharides to allow for the metabolism. If it can't be phosphorylated, nothing else can happen to it.

124
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:29,100
It's just going to stay there trapped inside the cell.

125
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:32,790
That's because the phosphorylated version cannot pass back through the channel,

126
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:36,900
even if the concentration gradient is high inside the cell from outside the cell,

127
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:41,190
because you're getting rid of the glucose and you're turning it into phosphor glucose.

128
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:47,700
Now you're building up a concentration gradient where the glucose levels in the cellar low and the possible glucose levels are high.

129
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:52,980
That can then draw in more glucose because all of these transporters rely on concentration gradients.

130
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:59,850
And then critically of all of these three sugars, the only one that can be phosphorylated is glucose.

131
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:04,710
There is no fruit goes past today's and there is no galactose prostitutes.

132
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:10,560
So that means once it gets into the cell and gets phosphorylated, it's going to stay in the cell basically forever.

133
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,910
It cannot get out of the cell. It's gone. It is obligated to undergo further metabolism.

134
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:22,110
It cannot be broken down for. And that's different from liver cells which have this enzyme glucose phosphatase,

135
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:26,940
which means liver can release glucose, other cells generally cannot fact.

136
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:30,389
And we'll talk as we get through glycogen and gluconeogenesis.

137
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:39,960
Why? That's pretty important. Okay. So Google kinase is the one enzyme of these four that can actually be responsive to glucose concentrations.

138
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:45,780
Right. It's off when glucose concentrations are low and it's really, really active when glucose concentrations are high.

139
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:49,500
So if you're fasting, glucose kinase activity is going to be quite low.

140
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:53,360
If you eat a meal, glucose kinase activity is going to be quite high. Right.

141
00:11:53,370 --> 00:12:01,290
So that's a decision the cell is making via the biochemistry of glucose because it's K.M. is closer to where the Google changes are in the body.

142
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:08,670
Okay. If you're fasting and working out and the way your muscles are getting glucose at that point would be a textbook.

143
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:12,470
Yeah. So helpful kinase is only in muscle. Never in.

144
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,630
Google Chinese is in liver, never in muscle.

145
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:23,450
And the way I try to remember that is you're between those two decisions, those first two decisions and try and pulse for relation also for glucose,

146
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:29,990
a regulating one or the other muscle cells regulate entry liver cells, regulate phosphorylation and anchors.

147
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:39,320
Okay. So you talk about how they're almost always active, those three types of kinase, those when wouldn't they be active?

148
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:45,770
So potentially, if the concentrations of fructose are galactose got to be incredibly low, they wouldn't be active.

149
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:50,000
That's probably not relevant here. By the time it gets that low, we wouldn't remember that number.

150
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:53,750
Do the only other times of the inactive is when there are inheritable mutations.

151
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:58,250
So there's no known inactivation that I've ever heard of, of, say, galactose intolerance.

152
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,170
We have downregulate like unkindness. All right.

153
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:06,370
So generally they're always on unless there is some inherited disorder, which we'll talk about at the end there.

154
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:09,770
Rare, I think they're they're somewhat okay.

155
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:14,840
So for the liver, for the pancreas and the brain glucose kinase is really important.

156
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:19,520
Right. That is the first decision those cells are making based on the kinetics of glucose.

157
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:25,520
So it turns out that there's a disease and this came up three or four glasses to go.

158
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:28,339
Somebody asked about genetics of diabetes. Right.

159
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:33,590
And there is a type of diabetes that is not quite type one diabetes and not type point type two diabetes.

160
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:36,710
It's called Mody, which has mature onset diabetes.

161
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:43,190
Now, this is kind of a weird misnomer. We used to call type two diabetes, mature diabetes and Type one diabetes, juvenile diabetes.

162
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:47,150
That turns out not to be that accurate because lots of children are getting type two diabetes.

163
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:49,670
But anyways, because of some historical modern culture,

164
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:54,799
what this means is people were getting diabetes very early, but it looked like type two diabetes.

165
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,100
Right. So it wasn't it did not. Look, I don't want to give too much weight.

166
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:01,999
It didn't look like type one diabetes. This is a monogenic heritable disease.

167
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,989
Right. So this is sort of like an important receptor deficiency or leptin deficiency, right?

168
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:11,260
It's strongly heritable. If you have an alcohol that causes moody, you're very likely to have mood.

169
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:15,480
Right. And this is medium ish, prevalent, one in 10,000 people.

170
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:20,870
So pretty rare. But if you see if you're working in a diabetes clinic and you're seeing a lot of patients over your career,

171
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:23,720
you're probably going to come across one or two people who have who have.

172
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:31,160
The most common reason for Mody is an inactivating mutation in glucose, right?

173
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:38,180
So by inactivating mutation, I mean Google of does not work that well and the mutations vary on exactly how that's going to be.

174
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:43,340
And so that's sort of the background what Modi is. Modi is mostly due to an impairment of glucose.

175
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:50,090
All right. So here are some clinical parameters here. They're looking at a variety of different mutations that cause Modi.

176
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:54,770
They're all Google kind of mutations. I think there's 14 here across 42 families.

177
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:58,469
They're comparing the people of Modi to their unaffected relatives.

178
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:03,770
So lots of control group. So relatives who do not have these mutations do not have Modi, but are roughly comparable controls.

179
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:06,650
Presumably they're eating a about the same things that the rest of the background genetics

180
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:12,140
and what you're showing here is a bunch of clinical parameters about these patients.

181
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,870
Okay, so I'm going to switch that, switch to the next screen and then I'll switch back to the next transitions.

182
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:18,910
So what I want you guys to do is going to be sort of a group things.

183
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:23,959
You're going to go into groups so that the group first is I want you to go through this clinical table and I want you

184
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:29,900
to first figure out what are the key glucose homeostasis differences between patients with Modi and the controls.

185
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:33,740
And then I want you to figure out, what do you think is actually happening here, too?

186
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:39,140
The glucose in the liver, how is pancreas functioning? How is the liver functioning in Modi subjects versus don't?

187
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:44,780
And then I want you to think about which do you think plays a bigger role in this case, the liver or the pancreas?

188
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:49,730
Right. So these are the questions that I want you to answer. So and hopefully everybody has access to this slide.

189
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:55,610
I'm going to leave this line up because it's probably easier for you to select on that.

190
00:15:55,610 --> 00:16:03,290
So spend about 10 minutes on this. It's.

191
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:11,770
Wow. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

192
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:31,570
They're very different organizations here to help us do it.

193
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:38,979
So why don't. Haley, why don't you call me?

194
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:50,110
All right, so I guess it's very interesting.

195
00:16:50,230 --> 00:17:09,850
Yes, because I think it's about time consuming, but this is going to be like 55 on the PlayStation.

196
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:20,590
Yeah. I was wondering, you know, this is like know I don't know.

197
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:36,170
Okay. So I know I you know.

198
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:39,630
Yeah. Okay.

199
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:44,350
Jackie. I'm sorry.

200
00:17:46,420 --> 00:18:09,340
Okay. So this is not everyone's like, maybe this is simply too much.

201
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:39,030
Every time I look at my latest TV ratings, sure, that's something that's been more clear why you might be able to solve those problems.

202
00:18:41,170 --> 00:19:02,680
So I think it's very easy to say that she was trying to do it because this is exactly what I know this and this is exactly what I was doing.

203
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,100
I wouldn't say that because it's not good for you.

204
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:13,060
Right. So, yeah, this was also my unit.

205
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:26,630
I mean, I had never done anything that you could do it that way.

206
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:39,250
Yeah, sure. I just get confused, because if you say any thing that would really have that feeling.

207
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:45,690
Yeah. Like significant feedback coming in.

208
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:56,770
So the significant ones that it's about and it's pretty easy said to guess what's the unique

209
00:19:56,770 --> 00:20:03,720
things that you can give or something you wanted to do that you think your girlfriend,

210
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:08,410
you know, that's all right.

211
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:23,230
Yeah, I think there's a few areas of the third place, you know, they're upset and start documenting the feelings that are needed for those things.

212
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:26,820
Like accountability. Yeah.

213
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:31,910
Like 909.10.

214
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:52,070
You know, there are two different ratio sheets if you want to call it.

215
00:20:54,050 --> 00:21:03,220
I mean it actually. So it's not really.

216
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:20,330
So the first place our muses on the street are focused and psychologically it begins to look for reasons behind the things that make sense.

217
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:25,240
It's like New York City.

218
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:29,630
Whereas saying the question is like, what's going on now? Iris, you say this.

219
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:50,459
My question is. You're making me feel sad because this is the first time, as you said,

220
00:21:50,460 --> 00:22:09,210
that it is not for the Big Brother because he's like, Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

221
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:31,560
So the point where you are right now is not something that's going on right now.

222
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:41,050
It's like, Oh, I don't know. Okay, so what do you think?

223
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:47,760
I don't know. Yeah, I think it doesn't.

224
00:22:48,890 --> 00:23:11,460
I understand all I know. It has an athletic center and goes back to the second stuff that was like, yeah, I not now.

225
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:19,800
So I was like, what is that? You know, it's just not exactly clear out.

226
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:23,710
Yeah. Because all it is is a concentrate for obvious reasons.

227
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:34,140
You see, what I'm doing is to make sure that I know how to say it.

228
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:40,260
Just like I was like.

229
00:23:40,270 --> 00:24:05,219
I guess it's like it's not about how you have an interest in the obviously I think it's in our question.

230
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:11,370
My point is so that she's like losing everything.

231
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:26,830
So you're right, but in the muscles and for those in your life is doing the right thing.

232
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:37,270
So I think the kids is right that some people spend a lot of, um, focusing on the fact that people think,

233
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:41,850
well, we already knew that we were talking about right now they already have diabetes or also.

234
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:57,510
Right. That's one question is why is it because like they're not responding to the so okay.

235
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:10,409
So you could look like we're either diabetic because they don't make enough money or anything like that.

236
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:34,910
Latter case, usually you figure out what your goals and then if it's like that's because of purple and I'm not sure how we might have no idea.

237
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:47,220
It's hard to. And that's why I say, okay, so I'm going to move on because we have a lot of stuff to cover today.

238
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:56,370
When you submit this because I'm hearing a lot of like I feel like extremely detailed but like down the rabbit hole type conversations.

239
00:25:56,610 --> 00:26:02,969
So if you're stuck, that's fine. If submitted, even if you're wrong, that's an opportunity for you actually give you feedback in terms of like,

240
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:06,600
oh, here's the thing you've missed, right? So don't feel like when you submit this, you have to have the right answer.

241
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:11,940
And please not like Google or an answer. It's the whole purpose. But yeah, okay.

242
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:16,319
So there's actually sort of two different types of variances.

243
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,410
This is why I like very many genetics lecture for this semester.

244
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:25,490
There's two types of variants in Google, kind of there's actually a activating buried in the portfolio you're talking about.

245
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:31,740
Moody is in an even activating variant, so less good Chinese activity, but there actually turns out there's an activating variant.

246
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:35,290
What they're going to have is hyper. We're insulating.

247
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:40,510
So they're going to make way, way too much insulin because what happens is their Chinese is way too active.

248
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,470
And that might give you a hint in terms of what was going on in the previous slide.

249
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:50,440
So Google Cart is, like I said, those variants, the variant that causes Modi is about one in 10,000 people.

250
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:56,229
This active reading variant that causes Hyperinsulinemia is about one in 150,000 people.

251
00:26:56,230 --> 00:27:05,800
So both are pretty rare. But if you now we have these very large databases of genetics that tell us things about population level things,

252
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:09,460
so not rare variants, but these are now what are called common variants. These are very sad.

253
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:14,410
In all likelihood, a few people in this class actually have. So there's a link here.

254
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:18,729
If you want to ever look up a gene and see if it has some relationship with diabetes,

255
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:24,730
it's type two diabetes or huge met before and I plug in Google kinase and you can see there's a bunch of variants here.

256
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:29,110
So these are all DNA mutations and they're all associated with some combination of either

257
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:34,740
fasting glucose or to our postprandial glucose or to our glucose after adjusting for BMI.

258
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:41,140
So a lot of these variants are associated with glucose levels. Now, these are much, much, much more common in the population.

259
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,730
These common variants are not determinative that they're going to have diabetes.

260
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:49,840
They just increase your odds of having hyper hyperglycemia.

261
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:54,790
Whereas a mody variant means if you have that variant, you're very likely to have diabetes.

262
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:58,719
In this case, if you look at the beta coefficients, you can see the beta coefficients here.

263
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:04,720
I realize the print is pretty small, are about 0.1, right? So it's increasing your odds by like about 10%, give or take.

264
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:09,400
Right. And you can use the population to convert them to log odds 3 to 5.

265
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:10,230
Right.

266
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:16,930
So these cause an increase in the likelihood of diabetes, but it's not determinant of diabetes, but these are much more common in the population.

267
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:25,270
So for example, that first of all, here are 730497 is present in 17% of the population.

268
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:29,709
So I don't know, cannabis, give or take, probably have that particular variant.

269
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:36,220
And not having that variant gives you about a 10% more likely chance of having higher blood glucose because of that parents.

270
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:40,270
Right. And this is accomplished by studies that are called genome wide association studies.

271
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:42,370
If I click in on that first variant,

272
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:49,959
you can see that variance is associated with all of these diseases which are all like diabetes ish diseases, right?

273
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:54,790
So high blood glucose, high fasting glucose, be able to see prevalence of diabetes, things like that.

274
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:59,570
So for any gene that comes up in this class, if you're interested, does it affect your diabetes odds?

275
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:04,660
You can always just plug that that into this link and it'll give you all this information.

276
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:09,370
And then if you actually care more, it can even tell you a little bit more about the molecular function in this.

277
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:13,569
It turns out this particular variant affects glucocorticoid receptor binding, which,

278
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:18,309
as we'll talk about in the gluconeogenesis plots is actually going to be pretty important for transmission, right?

279
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:23,680
So you can even get all the way down to what is the molecular mechanisms by which that variant actually affects diseases.

280
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:26,080
And doing all this information you can, in theory,

281
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:31,120
could come up with a more precise intervention for somebody with diabetes for this particular reason.

282
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:31,420
Right.

283
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:41,379
Because this person does not have diabetes because of, say, glucose absorption preference is the prevalence of these similar across all demographics.

284
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:44,080
Yeah, so many levels. That's a really good point, Lindsay.

285
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:52,180
So many of these meals you'll find are like super prevalent in one group, like maybe African-Americans or in people of Asian ancestry.

286
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:56,020
This is little actually. It's about between 15 and 20% in every single group.

287
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:00,100
And when you click on this will, it'll take you to this link here.

288
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:04,570
And then you can click and it'll tell you exactly as from population demographics for the really annual right.

289
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:08,350
So if you're curious, it's it's more likely to happen in, say, an annual population.

290
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:13,000
You can you can follow this one just for reasons I'm not 100% sure of is roughly.

291
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:20,070
That's not that. Normally there is some group that's higher that's 5 seconds of genetics for nutrition.

292
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:24,250
Six or I'm saying this now I'm going to come back to this like 100 times over the semester.

293
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:29,430
Okay. So Google counties and Mexicans, we spend a lot of time talking about Google, kind of.

294
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:36,220
So the key to differences between Google counties and Mexican is are Hexo counties is always effectively added to maximal activity.

295
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:41,290
So basically at any point past my era, it's doing its level best to pass early.

296
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:47,529
Everything it sees right because it has a very low K at Google is at that same concentration is

297
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:53,260
effectively entirely inactive right because at low concentrations it does not phosphorylated glucose.

298
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:57,850
However once Google kind of gets going it can be incredibly active.

299
00:30:57,910 --> 00:31:01,780
Right is super, super, super active. It has a much higher V max.

300
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:05,280
That's the rate by which you can convert a glucose into a glucose six phosphate.

301
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:09,190
Right. So it is much more productive once it gets going, but it's a little slow to get moving.

302
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:12,470
Right. So maybe it's like more of an afternoon person than a morning person.

303
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:16,690
Right. But Hexo time is is on all the time. Prime Pennsylvania's is on all the time.

304
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:23,380
Fructose kinase and glycoproteins were on this. They would look just like x. Okay so they're always on but have limited processing body.

305
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:28,600
Okay. So that's one control point here is that the level of protein phosphorylation,

306
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:34,240
if a cell like a liver cell has more white glucose around it in inside new, it will.

307
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:38,579
Generally not forcefully to glucose. It will therefore not do anything further with that glucose.

308
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:41,850
In fact, it will send it back out to the blood for somebody else to do it.

309
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,810
And glucose, the practice are fructose are not regulated.

310
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:54,740
Okay, so that's the first part. So that's entry. And first of all, the next part of regulation is at this level of PFOA one,

311
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:59,189
and I don't love the PFA one is the first complicated health story ends on.

312
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:05,639
We come across you because it is by far the most complicated allosteric enzyme that we are going to talk about at all in this class or nutrition.

313
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:09,120
631 If you take that class right, we're going spend a little bit of time on this.

314
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:16,320
But this is really, really complicated. And the reason it's really complicated is it is really the gatekeeping thing of now that it's phosphorylated,

315
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:20,910
what am I going to do with that glucose, right? Am I going to turn it into energy?

316
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:24,840
Am I going to turn it into glycogen? Am I going to turn it into an antioxidant?

317
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:30,800
All of these are on the table. And this is made by a decision which is right here at the onset.

318
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:35,639
Okay. So the way I sort of think about this is this is what's happened with glucose.

319
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:42,230
We've talked about entry, we've talked about phosphorylation, now glucose six phosphate, phosphorylated glucose, sort of three different places.

320
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,940
It can go petals, phosphates on glycogen glycolysis.

321
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:50,940
It's got to make a decision that glucose is going to make a decision that glucose has no brain, it only has six carbohydrate.

322
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,620
But it's still a very good decision about where to go.

323
00:32:52,950 --> 00:33:01,499
That decision is made by the relative activities of these three enzymes glycogen synthase, PVC one and glucose six phosphate dehydrogenase.

324
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:04,200
So we'll talk about all three of them for a few students. Okay. One right.

325
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:10,649
Now, the reason this happens is because if you have a particular product where you have an enzyme that is activated,

326
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:15,420
so let's say G six PD is highly active, that's going to make the nutrient go down that pathway.

327
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:17,999
Now, I visualize this. If you think of like a river, right,

328
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,549
a river is going along and it puts in force into three branches and then you dam off one of those branches, right?

329
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:26,280
That's going to make more of the river go down the other two pathways.

330
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:32,520
On the other hand, if you take one of those branches and you make that branch much wider, now, most of the water is going to go down that rock, right?

331
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:38,100
So that's how these decisions are made. If the enzyme is active, it's going to allow for more things to go down that branch.

332
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:44,910
If that enzyme is emitted, it's going to divert stuff to the other branches, other two or three or however many branches come off that branch.

333
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:50,010
And so if I just told you glycogen synthase is turned off, what you would say is,

334
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:53,010
well, that means I'm going to get more glycolysis and more Pinto's phosphate.

335
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:59,990
If I told you that K one is turned on, you're going to get more glycolysis, you're going to get less glycogen and less petrol station, right?

336
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:04,620
So that's how these decisions are made, sort of at a conceptual level, at a molecular level,

337
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:09,270
they're made by controlling the activity of key rate limiting enzymes.

338
00:34:09,930 --> 00:34:11,549
There's a lot of enzymes in glycolysis.

339
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:17,760
I've already seen people have drawn out glycolysis and and started thinking about how do I know all these structures do not memorize glycolysis.

340
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,390
I do not memorize glycolysis. I don't like three enzymes in glycolysis.

341
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:24,960
Those three enzymes are the rate limiting enzymes. Those are the ones that matter.

342
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:30,360
Those are the ones that control the flow of the little doc on the side of the river that you just breathe by does not matter,

343
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:34,230
you know, matter of it's not there. You're trying to dock your boat or something, but normally it does not matter.

344
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:41,040
So if you want to understand what's happening with these pathways, you have to figure out what are the rate limiting steps and what controls those.

345
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:44,370
That will then tell you everything that's going to go on with this pathway.

346
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:52,680
Right. So for glycolysis, there are two well, three, if you count hexagon, it's PVC, which we're talking about right now and pyruvate is peaking.

347
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:59,030
I do not name these names suck. I agree. These names, there's a peak one or two and they do different things here.

348
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:02,670
A peak there's an H, k, there's a G. Okay, this all sucks.

349
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:07,020
I'm sorry. I think they're out of their name. Like, what? Do you like, muppet names or something?

350
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:12,990
But again, this is what they're called, so just be really careful when you're reading these names and I will try to be

351
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:19,440
really careful to actually speak properly so that if I mean peak and I say peak,

352
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:23,170
both are completely different, but very similar sounding. Right.

353
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:28,040
And this is incredibly annoying and again, most prevalent in this glycolysis lecture.

354
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:31,830
Once we get to lipids and proteins, the names are not less complicated,

355
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:35,250
but they at least are a little more informative in terms of what they're doing. Okay.

356
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:39,150
JFK Just like. GK And you're going to sense a theme here.

357
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:46,920
I usually think about how to understand a particular enzyme by finding a case where that enzyme does not do its job properly.

358
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:51,900
And so in the case of Google kinase, it Google kinase does not do its job properly.

359
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:59,280
You get look and if it does its job to well you get hyperinsulinemia right and both of those are not great for PFA.

360
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:04,770
If you have a loss of function of PFOA, one of the rare diseases that is called torus disease,

361
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:10,320
it is a loss of function of the PFOA isoform that exists in muscle, right?

362
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:13,520
Those might affect liver cattle.

363
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:20,850
That's a completely different. And so the genetic mutation, heritable mutation in muscle and here are some symptoms that happen.

364
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:24,540
If you happen to suffer from chronic disease, you might have muscle weakness,

365
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:28,440
you might have increased glycogen in the muscle and you might have muscle breakdown.

366
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:33,600
Right. These are the pathological considerations. In fact, it was first identified as a glycogen storage.

367
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:37,450
Now I understand we're not talking about like in much because that's like, too much.

368
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:42,400
Does anybody want to hazard a guess? But why? There's too much glycogen in these muscles.

369
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:52,850
Because we didn't know that the muscles can't perform glycolysis, so they all get shunted over to the other pathways.

370
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:57,460
Exactly. So this mutation is like the dam in the river that is going to be sending that to.

371
00:36:57,620 --> 00:37:02,450
So you're right. We notice they have more glycogen. They probably also have more pendulous phosphate pathway.

372
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:06,140
That's just like let's they see on a microscope. Okay, great.

373
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:10,580
Why do we think we have muscle weakness and myopathy, which is muscle damage or muscle breakdown?

374
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:16,330
There's nothing it's not breaking it down and producing glucose to beat the muscle.

375
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:21,969
Right. So basically, it cannot convert glucose into energy because you get to the through glycolysis,

376
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:26,380
you need to go through K1 and to get to the TCA cycle, you have to go through like hoses.

377
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:31,180
So basically what that means is that these muscles cannot use glucose at all.

378
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:37,210
They can still use that, but they cannot use glucose at all. I may use protein, but not muscle.

379
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:41,290
And as your muscle is damaged, it needs ATP to repair itself.

380
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:44,190
It's also going to be impaired for that. So that's why you get progressive muscles.

381
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:47,350
And also the accumulation of glycogen can cause some problems, too.

382
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:52,660
Okay. So we can try to do something here. So I realize this principle does not work here.

383
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:56,860
What I want you to do is imagine these diets. Here's a bunch of different conceptual diets.

384
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:00,280
Somebody retries disease comes to you and they're saying, How should I modify my diet?

385
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:07,420
What would you recommend? And to do this, you have to open up the pool every year, and then you can rank them by moving the things up and down.

386
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:17,260
Okay. So I'm going to switch to the other screen, which, if I'm lucky, will be showing results.

387
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:21,630
And the results. Okay. Finally. Okay.

388
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:26,030
Alison corrected in a minute. So what I want you to do is kind of rank these diets in terms of what things are that.

389
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:30,740
Try not to look at the screen because you'll see what your your colleagues are are entering.

390
00:38:58,130 --> 00:39:20,820
Did you want? The the.

391
00:40:15,570 --> 00:40:20,670
Okay, great. So it looks like people have settled on high protein, high low carb, followed by low fat.

392
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:26,150
So that is that is the answer. Obviously, these things are not underlying.

393
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:31,820
You can have high protein, high carb or fat, or you can do the math between you.

394
00:40:31,850 --> 00:40:38,210
So some of you want to elaborate on either why they think high protein is important or why they think high carb is bad.

395
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:45,740
Well, it's been known that protein can help in the muscles like recovery.

396
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:54,870
So I would imagine that in a high protein diet like it would aid in rebuilding some of that muscle that is being damaged.

397
00:40:55,050 --> 00:41:02,580
Yeah, absolutely. So that's right. And then we move on to this yet because it's in the third class, protein metabolism actually is independent,

398
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:06,510
largely glycolysis and it's definitely downstream of the protein metabolism.

399
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:12,180
Not only is it going to help with repairing the muscle and building the muscle, but it's also going to be an ability to store stimulus.

400
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:21,600
And the question of why a high fat diet would be important because you rely on glycolysis to break down that.

401
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:25,680
No. So actually I'm afraid to scroll back because this is working.

402
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:34,020
Well, I tell you, go to that diagram that I had and we'll talk about this long class that actually feeds in at the time we re after glycolysis.

403
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:39,990
So yeah, you do not need glycolysis to break down that you need a cycle which is downstream of what's happening here.

404
00:41:40,890 --> 00:41:47,210
Yeah, that's a good question. The increased fat also helps with insulin resistance, too.

405
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:52,280
Right. Yeah. And so that will help with that. And also, you have to remember, these muscles need energy from somewhere.

406
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:56,950
Right. So you can't just be on a low carb, low fat, low protein diet. That would just be like a contract.

407
00:41:57,230 --> 00:42:01,870
Right. And so you have to get the energy of the muscle overall and actually churns out people on Trulicity.

408
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:05,810
So generally treated with exactly what you said, a very high protein, low carb diet.

409
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:12,810
Certainly that those people, when they exercise, for example, when they first start exercising, they're very slow.

410
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:16,490
They feel exhausted right away. But about 20 minutes in, they're fully fine.

411
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:20,960
Right. And so this is a phenomenon called second wind syndrome, which is a weird way of putting it.

412
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:25,430
But that's because at the initial stages of exercise, everybody's usually relying on glucose.

413
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:30,860
These people can't. But as you get through middle later stages of exercise, you can rely more on fat.

414
00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:34,490
And so these people are already fat to fat burning machines.

415
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:37,850
And so they are actually quite good at burning that in terms of using that for fuel.

416
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:41,870
So using ketones know they're using battery with Susan Candiotti.

417
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:48,020
Would you not want like patients with this to like do high intensity exercise?

418
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:51,800
Then you have to be careful, you know, be careful with exercises that are high intensity, short duration.

419
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:55,490
Right. And but they're also important that they try to investigate also right away. Yes. Right.

420
00:42:55,520 --> 00:43:01,700
Because your muscles are really good. But that could be if you repeatedly did that, like, say, a high intensity interval training or weightlifting,

421
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:05,780
they would report a it like sex more than sex for a regular person.

422
00:43:05,990 --> 00:43:08,380
But also you would notice more the damage that's.

423
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:17,109
Yeah, but that doesn't make you metabolize fat, doesn't produce more ATP than it would in glycolysis.

424
00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:20,889
It's actually a better source of energy. Yeah, I mean, you could vary.

425
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:23,770
I mean, I think the point that Hannah made at the beginning of a you need the protein

426
00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:26,919
to help with muscle damage that probably overrides the need for fat for fuel.

427
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:35,350
But you're right about a factor of fat is 9% more energy. And we'll talk lots about fat when you get to the trial, the whole of six lectures.

428
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:41,740
Okay. So as I said, so what is important is when you have if you don't have to get through disease,

429
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:47,410
but in spite of having it or not having it, in most people, the vast majority treat diseases like one in like 600,000 people.

430
00:43:47,410 --> 00:43:51,190
So it's pretty rare for most people, though, there's more of a moderate, a phenotype.

431
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:56,740
Well, we are turning on and turning it off in response to our bodies and cellular.

432
00:43:57,460 --> 00:44:01,570
And there's a lot of signals here. So we'll start with the most obvious, which is energy.

433
00:44:01,810 --> 00:44:08,700
So energy in this context is going to be ATP. When you have lots of energy, you do not need to break down glucose to make ATP, right?

434
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:13,060
So that's just a negative feedback because you've got plenty of energy. You can stop that process.

435
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:20,440
That's what ATP is doing on the negative standpoint with ATP is high, AMP is always low, with AB is high,

436
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:26,740
ATP is always like the regulators are controlled by by an enzyme that that keeps them intact.

437
00:44:27,130 --> 00:44:31,900
So if you high ATP by necessity of low amp but if you apply amp that is not

438
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:36,700
going to activate that high amp and you need energy because you need energy,

439
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:41,120
you're going to want to proceed down the glycolysis path, right? Because you want to use that glucose for you.

440
00:44:41,290 --> 00:44:44,140
So those ones are like the two straightforward ones. I'm starting with those two.

441
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:49,150
The next few, six BP and citrate are a little bit more non-intuitive.

442
00:44:49,330 --> 00:44:54,300
All right. So I'm going to kind of go through those after the slides and.

443
00:44:54,610 --> 00:44:57,610
Oh, yeah, the three, because I'm on the and on my laptop.

444
00:45:01,030 --> 00:45:07,330
All right. There's other ones like this which very sorry.

445
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:14,590
Like, yeah. So this is where we are here. So what I want you guys to do is I went through this example of energy and ATP.

446
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:20,919
What is energy doing? Why does that matter? What is ATP? There's a bunch of other regulators of getting activity.

447
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:24,909
And so we've got an adrenaline citrate. Two six BP What?

448
00:45:24,910 --> 00:45:31,360
I want you to pick one and I want you to try to tell me a coherent story about why that actually is regulating, right?

449
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:36,040
So the story I think I told about having a low energy one to glycolysis, having high energy, you don't want to glycolysis.

450
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:41,230
That's the kind of like conceptual framing I want you to be able to use to understand the regulation of these enzymes.

451
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:44,469
So what I want you to do is draw them, diagram how it's regulated,

452
00:45:44,470 --> 00:45:49,450
and then I want you to pick one now and explain why would that regulator be changed,

453
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:54,130
increase or decrease, and how would that affect activity and glycolysis?

454
00:45:54,730 --> 00:46:02,790
So let's do it. We have guys want you to work on. You can talk with the people around you, but we'll work on this for 5 minutes.

455
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:08,840
This might be the kind of thing that if you want feedback on this event, you.

456
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:24,010
I mean. Yeah, you know, you guys.

457
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:30,280
You do that. Yeah.

458
00:46:31,570 --> 00:46:45,560
Let's talk about.

459
00:46:58,290 --> 00:47:08,540
Mean, he's.

460
00:47:24,130 --> 00:47:27,340
She's not here.

461
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:44,200
Minutes to you.

462
00:47:57,560 --> 00:48:13,820
You know, the fact that he's taken it goes I think one thing he's done I think in many people's.

463
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:52,150
And so I think in that sense, you know, and then, you know,

464
00:48:52,600 --> 00:49:07,420
I just have to say what you just as a people, as a human being, you mean dealing with a lot of things?

465
00:49:10,570 --> 00:49:22,060
Like, I'm already experimenting and I really feel like.

466
00:49:34,430 --> 00:50:01,310
So it seems to me that, yes, I suffer in our lives so much, just like my sister.

467
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:19,970
I think we're making friends with a wide range of houses here at home.

468
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:35,750
I just want to understand what's going to happen to my family business if you look at this point.

469
00:50:36,730 --> 00:50:41,480
So that's not the answer to what you do. And that's a really great concern for.

470
00:50:41,490 --> 00:50:46,260
All right. But then it's like exactly how is this going to want to go with this place?

471
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:54,710
Because he's not only make right.

472
00:50:54,990 --> 00:51:00,730
You need to like this.

473
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:04,980
Well, I guess it's like sort of the reverse.

474
00:51:07,050 --> 00:51:19,890
Yeah. First off. And once again, once those ones associate you and not just me, and when I tell you that it's working,

475
00:51:20,050 --> 00:51:30,530
think that's why it should be in this list is more just to be details on how to write.

476
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:34,679
The only thing I remember, there's more.

477
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:45,300
Some. I feel like I. I was sorry for your loss.

478
00:51:45,870 --> 00:51:50,759
So I think I'm telling you something.

479
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:57,090
In spite of several of these health concerns, mostly I want to get involved.

480
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:22,780
Like, I need to see this is bad, and I'm not going to get into rate increases to these parties and civil rights issues to rights.

481
00:52:24,870 --> 00:52:33,660
So it's a little more likely to find out later.

482
00:52:37,290 --> 00:53:04,110
So based on what I was doing, this is really one of the things that happened and was such an important thing to get right.

483
00:53:11,790 --> 00:53:18,680
Like I said, I guess I'll tell you.

484
00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:22,860
Okay. So like I said, this is the most complicated enzyme we're going to deal with.

485
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:26,520
So this seems unreasonably complicated. I agree.

486
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:29,820
I would have it this way. It seems to me unwritten. Too complicated.

487
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:35,070
Like I said, if you were confused, we're not sure. Please submit something like that.

488
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:39,420
Right. So again, I do not care for this activity. If you are wrong that you're like, how do you know where to start?

489
00:53:39,690 --> 00:53:40,390
That's fine. Right.

490
00:53:40,410 --> 00:53:47,280
But try to go through this process for each of these regulations, because what I really want you to be able to do is explain in detail,

491
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:53,520
glucagon is doing this thing to this particular enzyme, which is affecting glycolysis in this specific way.

492
00:53:53,790 --> 00:53:57,659
Right. So that's the level of detail that I want you to be able to get for PBC one,

493
00:53:57,660 --> 00:54:02,820
which again is the most complicated that we're going to talk about all year, but also for all the other enzymes we're going to talk.

494
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:08,550
And like I said, if you're stuck, it's fine. There's still like a month later, we have a month to kind of get you unstuck.

495
00:54:09,930 --> 00:54:15,720
Right? Yeah.

496
00:54:15,810 --> 00:54:20,520
Think about how much feedback I have, how many questions I get from you.

497
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:26,510
Okay, so let's I'll go through a couple of examples here that might illuminate. It's sort of what I'm talking about sort of from a biochemical up.

498
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:31,490
So I talked already about this idea and he activates the activity of yeah, okay,

499
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:36,120
this is the activity of a if you have K one in the absence or presence of AMP.

500
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:41,480
So this is actually biochemically what it's doing. It's allowing for it to work at sort of lower temperatures.

501
00:54:41,690 --> 00:54:46,550
It's shifting this vertical. It's slightly also increasing the maximum activity.

502
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:51,050
And this is the same thing with AP and EPA.

503
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:55,460
Now, fruit goes to six because phosphate is the most confusing one of all.

504
00:54:55,610 --> 00:55:03,100
This is what makes this whole system 1 to 6, this phosphate, which sounds a lot like one six because phosphate but is not is an activator.

505
00:55:03,110 --> 00:55:07,160
All it is is an activator is not a metabolite that we use for energy.

506
00:55:07,430 --> 00:55:10,130
It is a signal to activate this power.

507
00:55:10,190 --> 00:55:17,269
So you can sort of think of this as like a traffic light for this here, here page whose job is to increase to 60 to 60?

508
00:55:17,270 --> 00:55:21,740
PS Job is to increase PVC once and this is what the kinetics of that would look like.

509
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:25,850
So you can see in the absence of two six BP across a huge range of concentration,

510
00:55:26,570 --> 00:55:31,160
one is effectively totally inactive, but it's an extremely potent activator.

511
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:36,760
Right. So you can see at all of these concentrations, if you have 26 BP, the enzyme is turned.

512
00:55:37,110 --> 00:55:43,310
Okay. And so understanding whether or not you have to six, BP tells you whether or not one is going to be active.

513
00:55:45,750 --> 00:55:51,800
Right. So it controls two six BP. That turns out it's the activity of PBC two.

514
00:55:52,250 --> 00:55:58,930
Right. Can't be too simple. One day when you can to mix two six, BP one makes 160.

515
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:07,759
So all of these signals are integrated at the level of this one enzyme whose entire job is to make this one signals activate activated one other.

516
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:11,809
And that this is sort of the detail that I want you to be able to kind of explain

517
00:56:11,810 --> 00:56:16,430
is insulin would be able to activate glycolysis because insulin activates this,

518
00:56:17,030 --> 00:56:21,440
which increases this, which activates that, which then increases glycolysis.

519
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:24,840
Right. But and I realize I didn't make it this way.

520
00:56:24,890 --> 00:56:30,730
This is just how it is. What I'm getting at or what I want to impress upon you is they're all like 1,000,000% to your question.

521
00:56:30,740 --> 00:56:35,420
But this let's be like, this is a super important enzyme and it will be a question about how it's regulated on the letter.

522
00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:37,640
I've never written the first example that was like that.

523
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:43,520
If you're confused, the best way to start into the cool game and ask a question and she started with the right question is like,

524
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:49,040
I am confident that insulin should be promoting glycolysis, so I have to get that right.

525
00:56:49,190 --> 00:56:52,970
I have to get to that is the right that is the physiological thing that should be happening.

526
00:56:53,270 --> 00:56:57,530
Keep that in your mind. So if you ever get confused, you know the starting point and the end point.

527
00:56:57,860 --> 00:57:00,980
Now there's like ten steps between the starting point yet point that I just went through.

528
00:57:01,220 --> 00:57:04,549
That's like a good level of detail, but you can get any of those wrong.

529
00:57:04,550 --> 00:57:08,810
You could forget what P of K two does, or you can forget whether insulin activates or inactivated.

530
00:57:08,990 --> 00:57:15,590
You can forget f26 is an activator inhibitor. But if you know the start and you know the end, you'll be able to probably self-check yourself.

531
00:57:15,590 --> 00:57:19,760
Like, does this all make sense? Positive, positive, positive, negative, positive or negative.

532
00:57:20,570 --> 00:57:23,570
So I really do recommend don't use my diagrams for this.

533
00:57:23,570 --> 00:57:28,219
I really do recommend you try to draw all this out in what mental model you have yourself, right?

534
00:57:28,220 --> 00:57:30,709
I have a bunch of different ways I can draw this process,

535
00:57:30,710 --> 00:57:35,690
but try to draw this out and then try to explain, all right, what would happen if I had glucagon?

536
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:41,800
Why would I have a lot of time? Why would that matter? Why would glucagon want to inactivate this whole process in the first night?

537
00:57:42,170 --> 00:57:48,799
Like I said, it'll get way easier for me because most of the rest of things we talk about, I'd like one or two activators not like such, right?

538
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:53,330
This is just happens to be highly regulated because it's a really, really important step.

539
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:57,560
Okay. So this is just a summary of sort of why all this regulation occurs.

540
00:57:58,070 --> 00:58:02,030
These slides, which I realize you don't have in your handouts, are on the canvas picture.

541
00:58:02,450 --> 00:58:11,780
There's some tissue specificity to this that is also really important because the regulation of PBC only occurs in liver, not in muscle.

542
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:15,190
Now the reason for that is muscle is greedy, right?

543
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:23,180
It's muscle gets glucose, it is going to undergo like hormones, just like as soon as it got glucose, it is going to have Taxol kind of transport it.

544
00:58:23,330 --> 00:58:27,740
Right. There's no use for glucose in muscle if it is not going to go to the point.

545
00:58:28,130 --> 00:58:30,730
That's why it got there in the first place as it was in every sense.

546
00:58:30,950 --> 00:58:36,469
Right liver is going to make a few more complex decisions about what's going on in the rest of the body, what's going on in the liver.

547
00:58:36,470 --> 00:58:43,010
Do I want to alter Glycemia in some way? And this is accomplished because the particular phosphorylation site on the liver

548
00:58:43,010 --> 00:58:47,900
enzyme is not present on the muscle or the fat site that steering is not on.

549
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:52,700
Okay. So I'm going to skip through some of these questions.

550
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:55,820
That's going to happen. Okay. So that's PFOA.

551
00:58:56,030 --> 00:58:59,299
And like I said, I went through that quickly. I apologize.

552
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:05,510
There is a video on this that might help if it doesn't let me know and have you find more resources in the last step.

553
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:09,070
So the third regulatory step we're talking about here is pyruvate kinases.

554
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:12,980
So this is a very, very, very, very last step. So PFA is up here.

555
00:59:13,190 --> 00:59:19,729
Are they kind of stupidly named because it makes pyruvate and it's got its own set of signals.

556
00:59:19,730 --> 00:59:23,510
It's regulated by insulin and adrenaline, it's regulated by the PFA and.

557
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:29,120
But one distinguishing signal for a peak peak is that it's inhibited vitality.

558
00:59:29,540 --> 00:59:34,660
And the reason that matters is ality, which is an amino acid is an indicator of amino acid excess.

559
00:59:34,670 --> 00:59:39,470
Right. It's just one amino acid, but generally alanine is high. That means all the other amino acids are high.

560
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:44,630
That means that if you have high levels of alanine, you can stop all of glycolysis by inhibiting the step.

561
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:48,650
And so alanine can feedback and stop glycolysis from occurring.

562
00:59:49,010 --> 00:59:57,100
And in addition to sort of being responsive to that ATP and to know this is a really important general concept,

563
00:59:57,110 --> 01:00:02,750
it's going to come up once in each of the three units, and that is this idea of macronutrient competition.

564
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:08,480
Right. You may think that our bodies prefer glucose or prefer fat or prefer protein at a cellular level.

565
01:00:08,540 --> 01:00:13,370
Our bodies prefer the thing that we have the most of. Right. So the cell is given a lot of amino acids.

566
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:17,990
It will use those amino acids and it will stop using glucose and stop using fat.

567
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:21,860
And then we're going to go through for each of these, there'll be an example that we can process.

568
01:00:22,010 --> 01:00:25,100
If you have lots of fat, you're not going to you look lost and you're not going to have protein.

569
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:30,080
Right. All of these communicate with each other. If you have a lot of glucose, you're going to suppress protein catabolism.

570
01:00:30,170 --> 01:00:32,569
Right. So all of these interact with each other. Right.

571
01:00:32,570 --> 01:00:38,870
So at a cellular level, you're going to catabolism the thing that you have the most of and you're going to restore or spare.

572
01:00:38,990 --> 01:00:42,049
The thing that is limiting. Right, is just a general rule across.

573
01:00:42,050 --> 01:00:42,630
All right.

574
01:00:42,690 --> 01:00:50,520
And that's why people live on extremely high protein or extremely high fat or extremely high carbohydrate diet because their body is adapting.

575
01:00:50,570 --> 01:00:55,970
If you want a high carbohydrate diet to really not burn any protein and all of a sudden you work for that.

576
01:00:56,030 --> 01:00:59,940
Right? And this will come up, like I said, multiple times, this unit. Okay.

577
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:04,730
So sort of like at the very end of this, you're going to end up, as I said, beginning with two periods.

578
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:08,540
There's a lot of fade to the power of it's heart rate. It can become a subtle way.

579
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:13,759
They can become ketone bodies, they can become lactate. We're going to cover all of this next class, right?

580
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:17,540
Because the fate of pyruvate going into the TCA cycle is what happens.

581
01:01:18,260 --> 01:01:26,120
Or the whether or not goes into the final is the next important is right after glycolysis what you get this year.

582
01:01:26,660 --> 01:01:31,000
And then I'm just going to finish for this part here on this idea of ATP, right?

583
01:01:31,010 --> 01:01:34,880
So if you just undergo glycolysis and level pyruvate, you're going to generate seven ATP.

584
01:01:35,420 --> 01:01:38,360
That's how much ATP and you generate.

585
01:01:38,780 --> 01:01:46,669
If you start at that point, you can't store pyruvate as a general rule, you kick that pyruvate out of the cell as lactic right to remove lactic acid.

586
01:01:46,670 --> 01:01:52,130
Also sort of things like that. To get glucose to lactate, you use a whole five ATP for that one step.

587
01:01:52,430 --> 01:02:00,590
So that means your net quantity of energy you get from one uniform all the way down to two is because of the seven five went to turning into lactate.

588
01:02:00,620 --> 01:02:03,730
Right. And that's very, very, very, very inefficient, right.

589
01:02:03,740 --> 01:02:07,490
Because you are in the whole glucose molecule and you're really going to reduce and

590
01:02:07,490 --> 01:02:11,389
this is compared to a growing glycolysis where you convert it all going to CO2.

591
01:02:11,390 --> 01:02:14,590
And as we talk about next size, you're going to generate 3 to 8, right?

592
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:21,330
If you don't believe me, go try for a run while holding your breath and you'll get much more energy if you get pregnant.

593
01:02:21,810 --> 01:02:27,590
Okay. So we're going to finish up today with the two other monosaccharides that have been kind of avoiding, which are fructose and black.

594
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:32,360
When we get to that, has it been. We did.

595
01:02:34,810 --> 01:02:47,690
We can do different things.

596
01:02:56,440 --> 01:03:01,610
I know everyone is looking to me. So my name is Hannibal.

597
01:03:01,610 --> 01:03:05,000
And then I receive this student of science and deportment.

598
01:03:05,300 --> 01:03:11,870
And today I will be presenting about Titan. So let's first start with the fascinating history of Honey's.

599
01:03:11,870 --> 01:03:21,580
Some honey is a sweet, brown, yellowish sticky sirup, and it is the everything is the sweetener known to mankind.

600
01:03:21,590 --> 01:03:30,410
It was actually discovered like 10,000 years ago. And the only way at that time to get honey was to find a way of life, as you can see in the picture.

601
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:35,810
And this remains for thousands of years. So they have to get a wide life to be able to extract the one.

602
01:03:36,290 --> 01:03:41,540
But the first organized beekeeping is actually in the ancient Egyptian times,

603
01:03:41,540 --> 01:03:49,310
like 3500 B.C. And they were the first to make fake beehives in order to be able to increase the production of Honey.

604
01:03:50,690 --> 01:03:55,549
So and this is the evidence that shows that the Egyptians master beekeeping a very large scale.

605
01:03:55,550 --> 01:04:03,980
And as you can see from the past during the old age hobby, like have the bees and hopefully reconnecting with money at that time.

606
01:04:05,540 --> 01:04:13,730
So as this the ancient Egyptian times interestingly honey was not going to use as a sweetener and it was also used as administrative medicine.

607
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:22,190
It was used to heal wounds and to regenerate some tissues, and were also used as a natural antibiotic for several infections.

608
01:04:22,190 --> 01:04:25,160
Also some gastrointestinal disorders. We're going to see later in the slides.

609
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:31,249
And I was really interested to see this and the best way to put it in the slides,

610
01:04:31,250 --> 01:04:36,380
it was used as a natural preservative for modifications to preserve bumblebees.

611
01:04:38,150 --> 01:04:44,120
So how was honey produced? So this would feed on flowers and it was collecting nectar and pollen.

612
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:50,270
And then they had these nectar and pollen. We get mixed in the stomach of the bees with certain enzymes and proteins,

613
01:04:50,630 --> 01:04:55,400
and then the bees will notice honey from their stomach into the honeycomb, as you can see.

614
01:04:55,730 --> 01:05:01,219
And these were in fact the rings around the honeycombs in order to thicken the honey and reduce moisture.

615
01:05:01,220 --> 01:05:07,430
Because I don't know if you know, but honey has a very low moisture activity or you know what I mean?

616
01:05:07,430 --> 01:05:14,210
That's why it can be stored for long periods of time, because also it's acidic if it was formed properly without getting explained.

617
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:18,440
So and when the honeycomb was for the company, it would be wax for protection.

618
01:05:19,310 --> 01:05:23,840
So how do you consume honey? Honey can be consumed as honey or liquid.

619
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:26,480
Honey commonly is the lowest form of honey,

620
01:05:27,140 --> 01:05:33,799
where the small bees and beeswax ingredients are both by the bees and to store the collected honey nectar and pollen.

621
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:36,320
But it is more expensive compared to the liquid honey.

622
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:42,770
Liquid honey is extracted and filtered and basically what we see in the supermarkets on the shelves and there are different

623
01:05:42,770 --> 01:05:49,300
varieties and this these varieties are depend on the geographical areas where the bees collected the plants and anecdotes.

624
01:05:50,540 --> 01:05:57,019
So if you go into the food that essential and at the USDA website and you like honey you would get like more

625
01:05:57,020 --> 01:06:03,020
than 20,000 credit for the one year I chose to look into this because the food because it's more flexible.

626
01:06:03,590 --> 01:06:10,940
So these are the macronutrients in one tablespoon of honey and just do it is the one thing is size because this is what you usually eat.

627
01:06:11,210 --> 01:06:14,060
We add this one samples to our oatmeal or to our cup of tea.

628
01:06:14,660 --> 01:06:22,980
As you can see, that one tablespoon of honey contains it's high in calories, 64 calories, and most of the time it is gone from sugars.

629
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:27,830
And we had very low and find a very low amount of fiber and protein and fat.

630
01:06:28,190 --> 01:06:33,379
So mainly we have 17.3 grams of sugar and maybe they come from both mono and bicycle.

631
01:06:33,380 --> 01:06:37,790
Right. But the larger percentage of sugar comes from glucose.

632
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:43,220
And this is the highest percentage so many sugars are coming from.

633
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:46,969
So many calories are coming from sugars with this mostly micronutrients.

634
01:06:46,970 --> 01:06:55,100
Honey contains several minerals, including, for example, calcium, iron, magnesium, phosphorus downstream and so, for example, in copper.

635
01:06:55,100 --> 01:06:59,020
But it does have a good amount of minerals with this like to divide them.

636
01:06:59,030 --> 01:07:02,410
It's also it contains some B WEIDMAN'S protein and vitamin C.

637
01:07:04,550 --> 01:07:11,240
So the bicycle rides at 20% that are present in honey are usually hydraulic hydrolyzed into one of the

638
01:07:11,570 --> 01:07:16,490
to be able to absorb them using in proteases and as a glucose in the ISS and these sugars in honey,

639
01:07:16,490 --> 01:07:22,219
they can be used to check the quality of honey because one these sugars like they

640
01:07:22,220 --> 01:07:26,330
are when honey is stored for a long period of time in unfavorable conditions,

641
01:07:26,660 --> 01:07:33,770
this sugar will do some chemical changes and it will lead to undesirable molecules as a result of my young the action that we took before.

642
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:38,690
And they are used to test the quality life of honey, indicating a possible exposure to high temperature,

643
01:07:38,870 --> 01:07:43,970
permanent storage time when they use the chemical changes that happen in honey.

644
01:07:44,510 --> 01:07:49,430
This is the best quality. It's not the most interesting part is the health claims of honey.

645
01:07:49,910 --> 01:07:53,600
So according to this review that was published in 2018,

646
01:07:54,060 --> 01:07:59,719
this showed that the activities of honey might reasonably have a high oxidant

647
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:06,680
activity and the cases of zinc instantly active with it and has anti-microbial.

648
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:14,690
And they might because of the antiparasitic activity also has and eye cancer activity because there are several mechanisms that

649
01:08:14,690 --> 01:08:22,219
give us cancer cells and stop the multiplication of cancer cells and also this antidiabetic because also it has a thickness,

650
01:08:22,220 --> 01:08:28,490
this inflammation that might on the long term improve insulin visibility and because of the whole basis for their methods.

651
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:33,510
And that's why it's important to work for a protect the cardiovascular system, nervous systems,

652
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:39,380
other system, gastrointestinal system, all because of the excellent anti-inflammatory effect on you has.

653
01:08:40,660 --> 01:08:47,980
So let's look at the same review that was published in 1980 individuals and how many bacterial strains actually born.

654
01:08:48,100 --> 01:08:56,680
So, for example, H. Pylori that we told you for leads to peptic ulcer honey can act upon dyspepsia preventing severe intestinal problems.

655
01:08:57,010 --> 01:09:03,940
Also, for example, it acts on distribution. Polio that is due to detect infections that is to do with the nose is one of the favorites.

656
01:09:04,090 --> 01:09:12,270
So on it has several has benefits and all of these beneficial effects are actually due to the high contents, often on the essence and localize.

657
01:09:12,430 --> 01:09:18,340
As you can see, we have several, several types of existent supplements and sites on you.

658
01:09:18,790 --> 01:09:25,390
However, some methods like this because of the factors that actually affect the availability of this,

659
01:09:25,530 --> 01:09:30,490
you know, maybe like one person eats honey, but he wants to get all the health benefits of honey.

660
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:35,229
This is mainly due to say that it affects first the environmental factors. First, the food processing.

661
01:09:35,230 --> 01:09:43,260
Also, the types of honey are like a natural and they contain these phenolic compounds, the type of matrix then in action with other compounds.

662
01:09:43,260 --> 01:09:45,249
So for example, honey interact with other compounds.

663
01:09:45,250 --> 01:09:52,990
It might because it's efficiency, the chemical structure of compounds and of course our composition of microflora as we talk also before that,

664
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:58,419
it depends on our microflora to have like to, to like react with it.

665
01:09:58,420 --> 01:10:03,700
And how about the health benefits from one? So also honey can act as prebiotic.

666
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:10,930
Why? Because it's lemonades needs the fermented cigarets and some other microbial one doesn't give honey the prebiotic property.

667
01:10:11,170 --> 01:10:12,880
So to promote the government bacteria.

668
01:10:12,910 --> 01:10:18,190
This is according to a study that was published in 2017 studying the effects of honey and improve the gut microbial balance.

669
01:10:18,550 --> 01:10:24,550
So it shows that honey promote the the bacteria this pathogens by acting synergistically with other probiotics.

670
01:10:24,790 --> 01:10:28,780
And it is not the same fatty acids and we know how much these are of the chimpanzee

671
01:10:28,790 --> 01:10:32,349
as its have health benefits and that's what is also resistance to pathogens.

672
01:10:32,350 --> 01:10:35,650
So it really benefits the gut microbiome.

673
01:10:36,850 --> 01:10:43,870
So this is a very interesting randomized controlled trial that was actually done in India in 2016, and they wanted to include it in the presentation.

674
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:47,919
So they wanted to test the effect of honey on oral mucositis only,

675
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:53,620
for this is one of the most common side effects for those that have had a neck cancer and they are doing going to do that.

676
01:10:54,040 --> 01:10:58,890
So they included a good small sample size, but like more research is needed in this field.

677
01:10:58,900 --> 01:11:03,500
Of course, what this is like I think the start of this. So 38 patients were included.

678
01:11:03,790 --> 01:11:10,180
The experimental group were given maximum height of milder oral mucosa and the control group were given a plain order.

679
01:11:10,270 --> 01:11:17,680
So after six weeks, 64% of the control group developed the oral mucositis, which is the last stage, and that was severe.

680
01:11:17,770 --> 01:11:23,860
However, only one participants in the experimental group divided into only two scientists, and the results were significant.

681
01:11:24,790 --> 01:11:28,570
Another city that tested the effect of 172,000.

682
01:11:28,870 --> 01:11:34,120
Also, they wanted to test the effect of the honey, how it treats diabetic foot ulcer.

683
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:38,160
And this study was done in Pakistan, India and Pakistan.

684
01:11:38,610 --> 01:11:45,340
And this has a larger and larger group of people experimenting with advancing migrations.

685
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:51,280
They will do that with honey and the control group were treated the salad dressing and they followed these

686
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:57,790
patients will 120 days and after that around 76% of the ulcers and things minimize movement mobility.

687
01:11:57,790 --> 01:12:05,380
And although only 57.4% and the control group work for him, as you can see from the P-value, the results were also significant.

688
01:12:05,830 --> 01:12:14,530
Also, the median wound healing science was one of for those shoulder for those in the experiment and group results were significant.

689
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:19,290
Last but not least, I wanted to tell you when I saw all that is plenty.

690
01:12:19,300 --> 01:12:24,100
I wanted to check if there are actually studies about COVID 19 because it has antiviral properties.

691
01:12:24,370 --> 01:12:29,950
So this systematic review was published using 6022 and included 15 studies.

692
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:32,620
We have been sitting with studies and they are simulation studies,

693
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:40,270
so they are computer based studies of how the certain proteins respond to and how certain compounds affect proteins.

694
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:43,870
I think we will see more studies, see the studies as they are used.

695
01:12:44,140 --> 01:12:50,230
It was shown that compounds and properties properties is also another key marks that that the honey

696
01:12:50,230 --> 01:12:55,059
produces has many health benefits as well get into asthma several package proteins of COVID 19.

697
01:12:55,060 --> 01:13:01,930
And because of the severity of uveitis that they see, the studies show that no symptoms in mind and women in severe cases of COVID 19.

698
01:13:02,290 --> 01:13:09,420
And the three our studies show that properties Anthony together could improve symptoms decades later students one of

699
01:13:09,430 --> 01:13:13,750
these as adjuvant therapy but of course more so does that mean that because some of them are also animal studies,

700
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:18,550
so more studies is needed in the future to make sure it's effective.

701
01:13:19,750 --> 01:13:24,969
So I want to and I would like to end my presentation by saying that my family and I are beekeepers.

702
01:13:24,970 --> 01:13:29,380
That's why I was I was inspired by them to do my presentation about honey today.

703
01:13:29,620 --> 01:13:36,230
And we do have our own brand of medicine and honey. So these are my references and, and.

704
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:51,220
So if you had a diabetic patient can be asked to study better than sugar, what would you do?

705
01:13:51,430 --> 01:13:55,310
Yes, I would say yes.

706
01:13:55,380 --> 01:14:02,580
But. And like control amounts. Why? Because, first of all, if I want to example, to drink a cup of tea and I like it to be sweets,

707
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:07,770
it's with take one and I'd say one sugar, one teaspoon of sugar.

708
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:14,370
Two, let's make it as sweet as I want. But it might take like one over 40 spoon of honey, so make it as sweet as I want.

709
01:14:14,370 --> 01:14:18,090
So because honey is more, like, more sweet than sugar.

710
01:14:18,330 --> 01:14:21,660
Because it contains more fructose than that sugar. And that's why it's more sweet.

711
01:14:21,990 --> 01:14:27,180
Second, it has a lower glycemic index compared to the sugar.

712
01:14:27,930 --> 01:14:34,049
So and because it's mostly high fructose, we know that fructose has low absorption efficiency compared to glucose.

713
01:14:34,050 --> 01:14:39,150
It won't raise the blood glucose. Anybody in the body like it's passed me.

714
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:44,190
That's why I believe remember the exact opposite inflammatory antioxidant activity of many months of course,

715
01:14:44,190 --> 01:14:48,080
in controlled amounts because it's when they want an exposure that's.

716
01:14:51,370 --> 01:15:04,980
Anyone questions. Were you saying that the phenolic acids are the one of the possible explanations for the anti-microbial properties?

717
01:15:04,990 --> 01:15:10,800
Because if I recall correctly, there's a lot of things I think I recall correctly and I don't.

718
01:15:10,810 --> 01:15:15,970
But it's that honey is antimicrobial, partially because it's very hypertonic.

719
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:22,570
And I was thinking that if you were to add it to, let's say it, for example, it wouldn't be as effective.

720
01:15:23,620 --> 01:15:33,080
It's basically is it the anti-microbial properties associated with the phenolic acids independent of that.

721
01:15:33,250 --> 01:15:37,020
Yeah. But instead of it being hypertonic actually it's not.

722
01:15:37,030 --> 01:15:40,870
Yeah, as I said, it has low moisture content and acidic.

723
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:46,480
It does as a naked has no age. That's why it's a second that lasts longer if it was stored properly.

724
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:51,340
But you ask anybody who's reasonable that we have to make sure we have to.

725
01:15:52,930 --> 01:16:00,520
You have to know how to eat, honey, because sometimes the temperature, as I said, the environment might affect the activity of different compounds.

726
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:07,300
So also, we should not, like eat handsomely on this, but if you to you should not put water and add honey to it.

727
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:12,060
And this will affect the availability of combining the.

728
01:16:12,760 --> 01:16:17,920
So you won't be benefiting from it. Yeah. So the best way is to eat it all, honey.

729
01:16:18,130 --> 01:16:22,690
And unfortunately, on the shelves in the supermarket, like many of them, have added sugars.

730
01:16:22,900 --> 01:16:29,150
You have to think that this is it. Oh, honey, they usually do that in order to decrease the cost and to increase their profits.

731
01:16:29,170 --> 01:16:32,649
But you have to eat like it all, honey, in order to get all the bands.

732
01:16:32,650 --> 01:16:40,730
You know, it's. I was just curious if you can.

733
01:16:41,300 --> 01:16:48,560
There's like a big taste difference between, like, the honey and the U.S. and then I mean that like, for example, your family makes in Lebanon.

734
01:16:50,030 --> 01:16:56,059
Actually, I didn't taste the honey in the U.S.A. I know I can attest to it.

735
01:16:56,060 --> 01:16:59,420
It does taste a lot different in Lebanon when it's fresh than it does here.

736
01:17:00,440 --> 01:17:04,309
Yeah, I was like, actually, I tasted one during when I was in Lebanon.

737
01:17:04,310 --> 01:17:08,750
Like, it's very different. Like, you can feel like just added sugar, like honey.

738
01:17:08,750 --> 01:17:13,040
It naturally is very sweet. But when you add sugar to it and you get it from the supermarket first,

739
01:17:13,050 --> 01:17:17,840
it's less expensive because they are adding sugar, less expensive, less cost for them.

740
01:17:18,230 --> 01:17:22,550
But it's very different. Yeah. And you can feel like you're eating something.

741
01:17:23,170 --> 01:17:28,729
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. All right, that's great. I'm going to wait the 2 minutes for you to get through my slides.

742
01:17:28,730 --> 01:17:40,730
So, you know. If you have any other questions for any, just feel free to put them on piano or track down.

743
01:17:41,540 --> 01:17:45,790
Well, both of the second best added sweetener in the world behind the curtain.

744
01:17:48,490 --> 01:17:52,899
Okay, so I'm going to zoom to this box and what I'm going to do for these next six slides,

745
01:17:52,900 --> 01:17:57,680
because I only have 2 minutes left, is all of the differences of glycolysis and fructose.

746
01:17:57,700 --> 01:18:01,239
I'll make a short little five minute video as well. So. All right.

747
01:18:01,240 --> 01:18:08,950
So don't panic about all my cooking. Okay. So one thing I do want to talk about as it relates to me and also just in general,

748
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:13,630
is this difference between food and we talk different about the absorption capacity.

749
01:18:14,020 --> 01:18:19,690
But there's a lot of debate about if high fructose corn sirup specifically a problem.

750
01:18:19,690 --> 01:18:28,630
Right. And honey, as you mentioned, actually compositionally, is not that different from HFCS 55 to just point out the particles.

751
01:18:29,860 --> 01:18:32,410
Now, there are some differences. Of course, it can't be stored as carbohydrates,

752
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:36,879
but key thing with fructose and this will make more sense if you didn't get it from the readings

753
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:42,820
when I post the video is that fructose tends to be not regulated in terms of its catabolism.

754
01:18:43,090 --> 01:18:50,409
Right. Some of the regulatory steps that glucose undergoes, such as K one, for example, are completely bypassed by some fructose.

755
01:18:50,410 --> 01:18:55,450
Basically, it gets in our body is translocated into our cells, primarily the liver.

756
01:18:55,450 --> 01:19:00,190
That's the first place it goes, gets phosphorylated and it gets immediately turned into really, really bad.

757
01:19:00,940 --> 01:19:08,070
So because of that, people propose that fructose compared to glucose is much more of a genetic and might be related to nonalcoholic fatty liver,

758
01:19:08,330 --> 01:19:12,250
which I want to bring up now because we're going to talk about it in a couple of lectures too.

759
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:19,030
So nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is that incredibly prevalent, but very hard to diagnose disease in Western society.

760
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:23,049
Some estimates say that about 20% of people, not 20% of obese people,

761
01:19:23,050 --> 01:19:30,520
but 20% of all people are probably suffering from some type of non fatty liver disease, like 80 million people.

762
01:19:30,520 --> 01:19:37,120
I think this is in North America and it's a progression from having extra fat and then maybe having fat plus some inflammation.

763
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:41,139
And then that can progress over time to scar tissue which replaced liver cells.

764
01:19:41,140 --> 01:19:45,160
At that point, it is irreversible and then in some cases of cellular carcinoma.

765
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:49,680
And you can kind of see the progression here of how many people progressed from from one section.

766
01:19:49,720 --> 01:19:55,810
But a lot of people have evidence of how tiny liver which can cause impaired liver function in a whole variety of context.

767
01:19:56,050 --> 01:19:58,640
We'll talk a lot about the inflammation part about this in the control penthouse.

768
01:20:00,280 --> 01:20:04,090
So people have done a lot of studies to say, well, is HFCS actually causing the disease?

769
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:10,450
And so there's reasonable evidence from observational studies looking at sugar sweetened beverage uptake and

770
01:20:10,660 --> 01:20:16,809
sweetened beverage as a proxy for high fructose corn sirup and the incidence of non fatty liver disease.

771
01:20:16,810 --> 01:20:21,070
You see there's about a 40% increased risk across across these observational studies.

772
01:20:21,070 --> 01:20:25,480
So that seems pretty compelling that at least from an observational standpoint, there is some association.

773
01:20:25,720 --> 01:20:30,640
However, the six cities are somewhat less clear. So two things about the RCD is usually the reasonably short.

774
01:20:30,740 --> 01:20:36,760
Usually these are two or three months they've been designed in two different ways. What is comparing fructose to an ISO caloric diet?

775
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:43,209
So replacing fructose with something else that have calories. In that case, there's an almost significant effect of fructose.

776
01:20:43,210 --> 01:20:48,310
Right? So in this case, it might be fructose or protein or fructose or fact or however,

777
01:20:48,310 --> 01:20:53,709
if you do an ISO floor substitution where you just substitute those for glucose, there actually is almost no effect.

778
01:20:53,710 --> 01:20:54,910
Right. There's no significant effect.

779
01:20:54,910 --> 01:21:01,340
And this entire effect is really drove despite this one particular study here that had an effect on this reading, it was actually put.

780
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:09,300
Right. So it's not clear right now in terms of novel, is fructose worse than glucose, even though the biochemistry suggests that it might be.

781
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:12,010
But like I said in the human studies haven't quite gotten that.

782
01:21:12,460 --> 01:21:17,530
One thing that is very clear about high fructose corn sirup is that because it is so high nutrient density,

783
01:21:17,650 --> 01:21:22,810
it very likely increases the rates of obesity, which in and of itself are associated with non health problems.

784
01:21:23,140 --> 01:21:29,500
So if I wanted to sort of explain the confounder here that is explaining what the observational studies are getting, but the RC teams are missing it.

785
01:21:29,500 --> 01:21:36,130
Probably overall obesity is different. But again, this is a relatively new field and people are responding to one study.

786
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:45,100
Okay. And then I'll skip that. Okay. So I realize there was a lot this is the most complicated lecture of the entire year, so please don't panic.

787
01:21:45,190 --> 01:21:50,650
I think it's past the drawback that drop out deadline so it's too late but like I said

788
01:21:50,770 --> 01:21:54,940
because we want to here try to just be aware of what was confusing and what was difficult.

789
01:21:54,940 --> 01:21:59,350
And we expect, you know, multiple emails about office hours is up next year.
