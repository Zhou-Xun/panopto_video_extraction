00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:19,640
An operating budget is a forecast of the revenues, expenses and profit expected for a period of time, such as a month, a quarter or a year.

2
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:27,300
Operating budgets are prepared at multiple levels within an organization.

3
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:36,600
They are prepared for individual departments, service lines and payers and then aggregated to the entire organization.

4
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:44,350
The starting point for preparing the operating budget is the volume forecast or statistics budget.

5
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:50,760
The statistics budget includes forecasted measures of workload or activity,

6
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:57,960
such as the number of inpatient days or clinic visits for each department, program or unit.

7
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,960
Forecasting volume can be challenging.

8
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:11,250
The future volume of a specific service depends on many factors, including population growth, population aging, disease trends,

9
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:21,690
changes in medical practice, internal changes such as the retirement of key medical staff and the activities of competitors.

10
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:27,920
Information from the statistics budget is used in preparing the revenue budget.

11
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:34,490
The revenue budget combines volume and reimbursement data to forecast revenues.

12
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:43,910
Revenue forecasts are prepared at many levels, starting with individual services and procedures,

13
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:53,900
which are then summed up to obtain an aggregate revenue estimate for a department program or unit similar to the revenue budget.

14
00:01:54,170 --> 00:02:01,250
The expense budget is a compilation of expense forecasts by department, program or unit.

15
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:08,020
The expense budget focuses on forecasting the costs that will be incurred in providing services.

16
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:14,440
To forecast expenses. Managers distinguish between two types of costs.

17
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:23,230
Costs that vary with the volume of services provided and cost that do not vary with the volume of services provided.

18
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:28,580
Graphically, the two types of costs can be shown as follows.

19
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:33,260
Costs that increase with the number of services provided are shown here.

20
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:43,160
These costs are called variable costs. An example of a variable cost is the cost of clinical supplies needed to provide patient care

21
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:49,370
costs that remain the same regardless of how many services are being provided are shown here.

22
00:02:50,030 --> 00:03:00,530
These costs are called fixed costs. An example of a fixed cost is the cost of the building equipment and staff needed to provide patient care.

23
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:06,530
Adding together variable costs and fixed costs gives us total costs.

24
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:16,120
The operating budget combines the revenue and expense budgets and uses this information to forecast profits.

25
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:22,270
The difference between revenues and expenses is the profit off a department program or unit.

26
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:27,940
When expenses exceed revenues, the department program or unit incurred a loss.
