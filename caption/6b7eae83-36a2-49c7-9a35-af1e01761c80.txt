1
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:11,509
In an outbreak situation,

2
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:19,670
public health professionals will carefully observe healthy people who've likely been exposed to some pathogen for the development of new disease.

3
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:27,740
However, at the start of an epidemic, or in a poorly controlled epidemic where the infection is occurring may not always be known.

4
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:33,740
For this reason, it is also common to ask those who become sick where they've been.

5
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:39,980
For example, do they travel to certain regions with no illness or eat at a certain restaurant?

6
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:48,080
If locations continue to be mentioned among those who are sick at a rate that's much more frequent than those who are not,

7
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:53,300
then we begin to have a suspicion that the disease might be spreading from that place.

8
00:00:54,330 --> 00:01:00,180
This type of questioning is called a case control design and is what we'll be talking through in this video.

9
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:06,390
Specifically, I'm going to briefly remind everyone of the case control sampling strategy.

10
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,330
Well, then talk about why this design is so effective.

11
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,860
And think about some of the nuances of this design.

12
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,629
Specifically, we're going to be looking at the different measures of association that can be

13
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:24,030
estimated depending on when investigators choose to select their control populations.

14
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:30,210
Then we'll wrap up by talking about the strengths and limitations of the case control design.

15
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:34,560
As you may recall from previous classwork,

16
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:41,520
the basic concept of the case control study is to compare the exposure profiles of people with and without disease.

17
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:47,280
Just as I would expect to find that people with more harmful exposures have more disease,

18
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:53,730
it is also true that more disease people should have more harmful exposures than healthy individuals.

19
00:01:54,660 --> 00:02:03,720
In this way, it used to be very common for people to imagine case control studies as the equivalent of conducting a cohort study in reverse.

20
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:11,280
You start with people with the outcome and those who don't have it and then ask what their exposures were before they became sick.

21
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:22,310
One of the absolutely coolest things about a case control study is that it can be conceptualized as a very efficient version of a cohort study.

22
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:29,600
Recall that the graphic on the left is meant to represent the full person time that could be collected during a cohort

23
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:37,220
design where some people will be exposed and unexposed and some of those will develop the outcome and others were not.

24
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:44,300
In the Case Control study, we collect exposure data on all of the people who develop our outcome.

25
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:52,670
In other words, the cases. But we only collect exposure information on a subset of the population that does not become ill.

26
00:02:53,060 --> 00:03:02,660
These people are known as our controls. So long as I sample my control population independent of exposure status,

27
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:12,020
then I can produce an odds ratio for the case control study that is identical to what I would expect to see in the full population.

28
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:17,270
You can see that here in this table where I have the full exposure distribution in

29
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:23,300
the cases and an exposure distribution only in a subset of the full population,

30
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:24,920
meaning the controls.

31
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:35,570
However, because the controls reflect the same sampling fraction of the full population among those who are exposed and unexposed,

32
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:39,860
I have the same F in each of my final two cells.

33
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:47,150
Therefore it cancels out and my odds ratio is exactly the same as what I would see in the full population.

34
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:52,010
So why am I only sampling a fraction of the population?

35
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:57,920
Well, I like to think of it because epidemiologists are clever and with the case control design,

36
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:02,330
we figured out a way to efficiently get the right answer without meaning.

37
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:05,960
To spend as much time and money. Good on us, right?

38
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,810
Actually, the design gets even better.

39
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:18,110
Let's imagine a scenario where I have an exposure that can be measured in blood, but it requires a very expensive laboratory test to do so.

40
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:22,340
If I had a cohort study where I had blood on everyone,

41
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:28,670
the problem might be that my test is just way too expensive for me to sample the full population.

42
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:37,350
What I can do instead is I can analyze the blood of all cases that developed during my follow up time.

43
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:45,720
This will give me information about my A and C cells in the table because these are new cases of disease.

44
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:50,239
It's going to give me estimate of incident disease. Now.

45
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,350
So far, I've saved no money. Right. I've sampled all of my cases.

46
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:58,790
But what about the data on exposure from the total population?

47
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:07,540
Well, in this situation, I can actually analyze the blood from a random sample of the population at baseline,

48
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:15,400
which will give me an estimate of the exposure distribution in the full based population that gave rise to the cases.

49
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:22,749
But this time I don't need to spend the money to sample everyone so long as my sample is selected.

50
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,790
Without respect to their exposure,

51
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:33,910
I will be able to accurately estimate the same risk ratio as I would see in the full population, but at far less cost.

52
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:40,419
This can be seen here by the sampling fractions of F canceling out in my equation

53
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:45,790
for the risk ratio when F is equal among the exposed and the unexposed.

54
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:52,150
Now note that this type of sampling strategy is called the case cohort design.

55
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,700
And in this situation,

56
00:05:54,940 --> 00:06:05,200
cases can also be included in my control group to estimate the exposure distribution in the total population before they become sick.

57
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:12,690
In the case control design, we are also able to estimate the rate ratio without error.

58
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:19,799
If we employ something that's called the risk set or incidence density sampling under this approach,

59
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,940
I again collect exposure information for all incident cases.

60
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:31,380
But now what I do is I select controls who are still at risk at the time that each case occurred.

61
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:40,710
In this way, what I'm doing is I'm looking at the exposure distribution that's reflective of the full person time in the population,

62
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:48,570
since people who are in the study for a longer period are much more likely to be sampled than those who leave the study early.

63
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:55,170
Again, the key assumption is that my control selection is independent of exposure.

64
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:57,150
Now, in this design,

65
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:06,420
it's possible that a person who eventually becomes a case can serve as a control for a different case that occurred at an earlier time.

66
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:12,210
For example, you can see that here with the third case serving as a control for the second case.

67
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:19,800
I also want to note that it's not required for me to conduct this design nested in an existing cohort.

68
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:26,490
Rather, it's quite common for investigators to recruit cases from some registry, for example,

69
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:33,210
and then select controls from the general population at the time that the cases occurred.

70
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:39,800
In this way, they're trying to get the estimation of the exposure in the population that gave rise to the cases.

71
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:49,400
So just briefly summarize for all of the different sampling designs I showed you with the case control study,

72
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:53,150
we can estimate the odds ratio without error.

73
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:57,440
This can be used for incident disease or prevalent disease.

74
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:06,410
In this situation where I identify new cases of disease, I can also estimate the risk ratio without error.

75
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:13,890
If I use the case cohort design, similarly, I can estimate the incidence rate ratio without error.

76
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:21,649
If I use risk set or incidence density sampling and the bonus of all of this is that I've estimated

77
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:27,560
all these measures with fewer resources than what would be required in a typical cohort approach.

78
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,309
Now, of course,

79
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:38,590
none of this is possible without the critical assumption that I've sampled my comparison or control groups without risk factor exposure.

80
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:47,879
If it helps you, I recommend this following mantra that I memorized during my graduate school training program and say in my head,

81
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:58,440
Every time I think of a case control design, your controls should reflect the exposure distribution in the population that gave rise to the cases.

82
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:09,160
Since this is a very abstract notion, let's talk through a real world example of where I could violate this assumption and get things wrong.

83
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:17,500
Take, for example, a scenario where I wanted to look at whether or not smoking increased the risk of hospitalization from the flu.

84
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:25,750
If I go to the hospital and recruit all of the people who've been admitted for the flu and ask them about their exposure experience,

85
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:30,940
I now have an accurate representation of the exposure, distribution and cases.

86
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:36,340
But now I need some controls to compare them to a logical place.

87
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:43,000
Might be to get other people that have gone to the same exact hospital for totally different, say, noninfectious reasons.

88
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:47,050
I might think that a heart attack would be a good control group.

89
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:53,250
The problem here, however, is that smoking is also a risk factor for heart attack,

90
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:59,010
such that the distribution of exposure in my control group of heart attack patients is

91
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:03,570
likely to be very different than the general population that gave rise to the cases.

92
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:13,470
In this way, I will no longer have an accurate estimate of either the risks or the rates of admission for flu as a result of smoking.

93
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:19,989
Now, if you were attentive, you may have realized that there's one final strategy to discuss,

94
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:23,380
which is when the controls are selected at the end of a study.

95
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:30,370
In this situation, it's highly unlikely that the exposure distribution among survivors at the end of the

96
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:36,760
study period will reflect the original distribution of exposure in the full population.

97
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:45,460
Since we're now removing everyone who got the outcome, the only time that this really works is if the disease is very rare.

98
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:53,800
Conceptually, this makes sense because if a disease is rare, then the distribution at the beginning is likely the same as at the end.

99
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,209
In addition,

100
00:10:55,210 --> 00:11:05,470
you can see this mathematically in the risk ratio equal to the odds ratio when A plus B is effectively just B and C plus D is effectively just D.

101
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:15,680
So in conclusion, the case control study selects individuals based on their outcome status and compares their exposure distributions.

102
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:21,680
The strengths of this design are that it's very good for rare or long latency outcomes

103
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:26,480
because we don't have to wait for these new outcomes like we do in a cohort study.

104
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:37,940
It's also very efficient both in terms of time and cost, and finally, it can potentially investigate more than one exposure in the same study.

105
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:45,049
Limitations of the case control design are that control selection can be very challenging,

106
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:51,620
and if you don't do it well, you can introduce bias incidence, density sampling or risk set.

107
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:58,100
Sampling is really only good for one particular outcome because you're matching on time of event.

108
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:04,560
Exposure data is also collected after the disease has happened.

109
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:11,160
So it's highly likely in the case control design that you may have less accurate exposure information.

110
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:17,370
And finally, the case control design is not very good for rare exposures.
