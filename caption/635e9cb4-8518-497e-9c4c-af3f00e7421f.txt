1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,860
Just so you know.

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,760
Hi, everyone. Happy Halloween. Thanks for being here.

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,680
I have just one quick announcement.

4
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:25,980
Today I have faculty meeting until 430, so office hours will be from 430 to 5 today.

5
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:32,020
If that presents a problem, please just follow up me.

6
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:37,710
Find another time. But that's okay with everyone.

7
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:42,210
Oh, good. Um. Okay.

8
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:49,250
Is there any. Feels like it's been a long time, but I know it's only then there's a guest lecturer in between, so.

9
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,790
Feels like it's been a while since I talked to you. Is there any.

10
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:58,560
Any issues regarding, like, course, mechanics or what the assignments are?

11
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,410
Anything like that that anyone wants to talk about or needs clarification on?

12
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:10,010
It's pretty good to go. Okay.

13
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:13,440
So jump into the material for today.

14
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:24,420
Dr. Perera gave like a really interesting and wonderful talk on developmental toxicology, and we got into some really good discussions last time,

15
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:29,190
and I think so I just wanted to go back and fill in some of the stuff that we

16
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:33,290
weren't able to get to in the allotted time related to developmental toxicology.

17
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,879
So I'm just going to do the first part of this lecture,

18
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:42,750
wrapping up some points I wanted to make and make sure that we go over regarding developmental toxicology and then I'll

19
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:48,120
give us like a five minute break or something so we can transition and we'll transition over to pesticide toxicology.

20
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:52,049
So and I'm not sure if we'll get to all of that today.

21
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:57,270
So that might bleed over. So we might get some bleed over over the next couple of lectures until we sort of even things out.

22
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:01,830
But we'll just kind of see how it goes. Yeah. Is it possible to publish those slides?

23
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:05,640
Sorry, the slides around campus. Is it possible? Oh, yeah.

24
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:12,209
I'm sorry. Sometimes I don't want to publish the slides before class because there's like a question in there that I want to be able to,

25
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:15,330
like, talk through and not give you the answer to right away.

26
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:20,340
So that was the case for this on it. Uh, most of the time I'll probably try to publish them,

27
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:26,100
but sometimes I just would rather just like talk through the slides and then publish them after if that's a problem.

28
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:31,169
Like, you know, different people learn different ways sometimes I would really like to have slides before a lecture.

29
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:33,090
Sometimes I didn't. It didn't matter so much.

30
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:44,730
So if the broad consensus is like make sure to get them up before class, I can do that and kind of work my way around it like but so yeah.

31
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:48,690
Is that, is that the general consensus that everyone likes to have the slides before class.

32
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,020
Okay. Okay. Noted. Okay. Sorry about that.

33
00:02:52,500 --> 00:03:02,700
Something that one of my avid professors does is they post a student version and then like the final version so that students

34
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:08,580
can just open the student version so that if they're like discussions or something that we don't want to answer is on there.

35
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,120
Okay. So I don't know if that's yeah, I can do that.

36
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:17,609
Yeah, I can do that for sure. Yeah. Sorry about that. I didn't, I didn't know whether there was a strong opinion one way or the other.

37
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:20,820
So I guess I should ask that before, but I can definitely do that.

38
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:29,179
And for those that doesn't, I guess, you know, like the the cost benefit ratio is like for those that don't care,

39
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:33,610
I just want, you know, look at the slides beforehand. So. Okay, good feedback.

40
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:45,329
In addition, I just wanted to like the metaphor, but this is, I guess, not really related,

41
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:49,720
but in terms of like what you're supposed to be taking from each lecture.

42
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:54,550
I think you probably have a good sense of that at this point.

43
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:56,820
Basically, you've gone through the exam before,

44
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:05,610
but if you have any questions about whether you're going to need to know a particular slide or a particular mechanism beforehand,

45
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:08,240
I can always, you know,

46
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:14,490
clarify that if there's something that you think is like I try to mention, if I'm throwing up a slide that seems really complicated,

47
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:18,389
I'll try to mention that like, you don't need to memorize this, but I'm not.

48
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:25,940
I might forget to do that. So I would say, you know, if you have a question about whether, you know, obviously the exam is the structure,

49
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:29,340
the exams aren't such that you're going to necessarily need to memorize anything.

50
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:37,770
But if you need clarification on that, I can provide that as well. So yeah, I just wanted to sort of talk through that.

51
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:44,770
Okay. So I'll dive into the material now. Okay.

52
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:52,239
So last time Dr. Perera talked about, I think she posted this slide about the scope of the problem and how, you know,

53
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:58,540
maybe we don't think about how successful pregnancies actually kind of happen at a surprisingly low frequency.

54
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,970
And so like pregnancies that you know,

55
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:10,930
and what I mean by that successful is like no sort of adverse developmental issues or like loss of the blastocyst post implantation,

56
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:16,959
these types of things, miscarriage, etc. There's so many things that we talked about that can go wrong potentially in the pregnancy.

57
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:24,610
And so here are some statistics here. Like 30, you know, 31% of pregnancies lost post implantation.

58
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:35,290
So that means the blastocysts implanted into the into the uterus, but didn't develop into a fully viable newborn.

59
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:40,570
Right. And then we have, you know, birth defects, a certain percentage.

60
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:45,399
We have minor birth defects, 14%.

61
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:51,310
We have low birth weight, you know, 7%. And that impacts on abnormal neurologic function.

62
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:54,519
So this is just giving you giving you an example,

63
00:05:54,520 --> 00:06:00,610
some examples of how multiple things can go wrong during this period of gestation when so many different

64
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:06,910
organs are developing into what will eventually be the fetus and then the newborn going forward.

65
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:20,090
Right. So we've seen cases of chemical, biological, dietary and genetic factors linked to these adverse developmental outcomes.

66
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:29,780
But we still there's a lot we don't know. So this is kind of highlighted by the fact here the cause of 50 to 70% of birth defects are still unknown.

67
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:39,469
So as toxicologist, that's really interesting for us because that kind of naturally leads us to wonder whether there's an environmental component that

68
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:47,630
we are not accounting for impacts on developmental pathways by environmental environmental toxicants that may be influencing this.

69
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:58,979
So I'm not sure if Dr. Perera posted this slide or not, but I think it's important to just make sure we touch base on it again.

70
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:06,330
If not, so, when we think of development, we think of like development requires this integration of,

71
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:11,399
you know, it's a super complicated process, as you probably are aware.

72
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:15,690
So this requires integration of cells and signals in time and space.

73
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:20,640
So over the nine months of development, you're developing different organs, different limbs.

74
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:25,200
Another neurological development is going on, reproductive development is going on.

75
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:31,440
So we have this like coordinated, like dynamic set of signaling processes that happens throughout gestation.

76
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:37,169
And these need to be sort of like integrated not only across time but in space.

77
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:39,629
So like certain events need to happen, like digitization,

78
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:45,000
like the formation of the fingers on the hand, like sort of happens in a sort of coordinated way.

79
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,840
You get, you know, some of the cells, sort of like apoptosis go away.

80
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:58,319
You get the formation of the hand, you know, so so that happens in sort of a spatial way and a time in a time the sense as well.

81
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:08,720
Does that make sense? So any chemical that disrupts this system could produce developmental toxicity, right?

82
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:15,580
And we talked I think we did talk about this line I recall correctly, but so this could include disruption of the numbers of cells.

83
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:20,910
Do you have are the neurons progenitor cells proliferating enough?

84
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:29,280
Are the germ cells in the developing testes proliferating enough that we have enough germ cells to have a form,

85
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:36,960
enough sperm to have like these kind of sperm count for successful reproductive event later in life.

86
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:46,270
You could just you know, we've talked quite a bit about disruption of like hormonal signaling, which drives a lot of this development.

87
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:49,980
Right. We talked a lot about that in the reproductive lecture.

88
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:51,969
Receptors.

89
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:59,379
So again, like receptors, you know, chemicals can act on receptors, block receptors, activate receptors, apparently, and other factors, too.

90
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:04,480
You could be talking about things like cytokines or molecules that drive inflammation

91
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,650
could impact development if they're sort of activated at the wrong time.

92
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:18,059
So migration. So again, this is like the spatial idea. So in order to like develop, you know, different or differentiated to different Oregon,

93
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:23,580
certain cells need to be like migrating to certain parts of the developing embryo or the developing fetus.

94
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:27,480
So you can impact the ability of these cells to like kind of know where they're trying

95
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:33,570
to go to differentiate into like a liver or into a kidney or wherever they need to go.

96
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:40,290
Right. Okay.

97
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:44,520
So there's a couple of graphs I want to show that kind of illustrate the dynamics of this.

98
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:51,570
Okay. So, you know, this is a nice graph that shows what we call the early like the embryonic period.

99
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:57,930
And we're marching through time and then we'll get to the fetal period where we're continuing our growth.

100
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:02,860
Right. So there's some pictures here. We see a lot of cell proliferation going on.

101
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:09,540
And so these are days. Right? Cell proliferation, cell differentiation, migration, etc.

102
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,610
This would be equivalent to like the fertilization event where the sperm egg,

103
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:26,190
the implantation acute occurs a few days later so that the zygote travels down the fallopian tube into the and then implants into the uterus.

104
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:31,860
Right. And so, yes, you have implantation and then organogenesis.

105
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:41,010
So you can see, like the development of the origins is like taking off kind of quickly after implantation and kind of

106
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:47,250
overlapping with when these things occur is when they're sensitive to disruption by a toxic and exposure.

107
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:55,770
So like while the liver is forming or developing or why the brain is forming, it's going to be uniquely susceptible to toxicant damage.

108
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:01,380
And so that's why we're we're this access is labeled as degree of sensitivity.

109
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:04,380
So, yeah, organic genesis.

110
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:12,840
And then the genesis is basically like differentiation of cells into like specialized organs and tissues like those functional cells in the liver,

111
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:18,140
hepatocytes, what have you. So this takes you through, up into birth, right?

112
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:24,780
So. This gives you a sense of how there are different stages.

113
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:33,299
So I think sort of one way to think about this is that like a embryo, it's not a 30 day embryo, for example.

114
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:40,920
It's not the same as a 90 day fetus. They're like go undergoing sort of different degrees of development or different types of development.

115
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:49,380
So that makes this like a really complicated sort of biology to understand in terms of developmental toxicity.

116
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:59,210
Any questions making sense so far? We also talk about Windows Susceptibility.

117
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:03,300
Yeah, that's just kind of another way of rephrasing what I just said.

118
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:08,340
So these developmental stages at time of exposure are going to influence the outcome,

119
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:12,270
like what types of developmental outcomes are being impacted by a particular chemical?

120
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:23,610
Right. So again, as I talked about organic genesis, the development of the organs, the forming of the organs happens at the embryonic stage.

121
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:32,670
Yeah. And so during this period, you know, you're going to have this maximum sensitivity to a chemical causing malformation in a particular organ.

122
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:39,690
And then the fetal period when all the organs are pretty much developed, you know, there's still development that occurs.

123
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:43,560
But, you know, you have like all of the organs are basically what they're going to be.

124
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:53,189
This is a period where you can have functional deficits if you're exposed to a developmental toxicant and you're undergoing damage, like, you know,

125
00:12:53,190 --> 00:13:01,620
for example, like, say, your sperm cell, you may have a low sperm count if you're exposed to a male reproductive toxicant at that stage.

126
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:09,780
And we can also see some relationship to like cancers forming later in life related to exposures of the stage.

127
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:21,040
So when we think about developmental toxicology, a lot of times we're using animal models.

128
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:28,779
And so it's important to understand that there obviously are differences in the

129
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:33,579
timing of organic genesis and fetal embryonic and field development across species.

130
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:40,059
Right. And so this table is going to show you comparisons of when, say, the blastocyst forms in a rat,

131
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:47,840
rabbit, monkey or human, and we have these like so these are days of development in gestation, right?

132
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:52,330
So you can compare across here. And again, this isn't something you need to memorize or anything like that.

133
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:55,270
But I just wanted to show like that.

134
00:13:55,270 --> 00:14:03,670
For example, in the Rat Organogenesis takes place in this window from 6 to 17 gestational days, and then in the human it's 21 to 56.

135
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:14,470
So if you're like testing a chemical for developmental toxicology and you're kind of like comparing if you looked at days six through 17 and.

136
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:25,270
Or sorry if you looked at day 21 in a rat, for example, and are expecting that to be equivalent in a human, that's not really a comparable timeframe.

137
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,110
Does that make sense?

138
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:32,770
So there's a lot of comparative biology going on that we need to understand if we're going to understand these developmental endpoints.

139
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:46,740
So this is just a more kind of specific graph that shows the development of various organs in the body and when they take place.

140
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:54,370
So this is in weeks. So you have your embryonic period here and your fetal period here, neural development taking over,

141
00:14:54,400 --> 00:15:05,620
taking place over this long stretch of time, heart development occurring kind of in this window and then on to like ear and eye teeth, etc.

142
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:19,300
Right. And this is nicely laid out where if you were to be exposed to a sort of hypothetical developmental toxicant at this time period,

143
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,040
you know, this five weeks,

144
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:29,830
we would expect to see potentially expect to see major abnormalities in these following organs here, as indicated by this like dark red color.

145
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:33,690
And then if we of exposure were to occur later,

146
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:42,600
we would expect to see functional and maybe minor abnormalities in the organs where we see this like sort of more light, red, light, reddish.

147
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:45,710
However, it's showing up there like orangish color here,

148
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:52,709
so we can have sort of major structural abnormalities that can occur or we can have impacts on the function of the organ.

149
00:15:52,710 --> 00:16:04,020
Select Maybe the heart is beating as efficiently if an exposure occurs here or like minor abnormalities where whereas if in the early days,

150
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:09,480
if an exposure occurs, might have a really major abnormality in the formation of the heart.

151
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:20,270
This is just kind of cool. This is the Carnegie stages of human embryo, just based on time.

152
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:24,850
This is it really is just kind of a striking picture.

153
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:33,229
I just want to include in the set of slides. But yeah, there's been a lot of work that's been gone into both, not just developmental toxicologists,

154
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:39,230
of course, but like developmental biologists in staging these periods of human and animal development.

155
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:44,810
And, you know, it's just a pretty fascinating area of research if this is the type of thing you're interested in.

156
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:52,910
Um, you know, it's just, there's like, no edit to like, things you can explore with this type of these biological processes.

157
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:04,620
And again, this is sort of another, you know, another graph kind of making the same point.

158
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:08,110
So what they're graphing here is the percent of malformations we would expect

159
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:13,180
to see if we were to give a pulse or like a single dose of a travel agent.

160
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:18,100
So, remember, traditions are chemicals that cause birth defects, basically.

161
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:22,180
Right. So a teratogenic a particular day.

162
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:28,360
So you give like a really high dose to the pregnant rat at day ten, for example,

163
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:36,130
and based on the dynamics of the formation of the origins in the sort of litters that come from that,

164
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:42,100
the litter that comes from that pregnant rat, you'd expect to see a certain percentage of malformations in Oregon.

165
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:53,410
So this is kind of showing the the distribution of of the percentage of malformations you might expect to see based on what time,

166
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:56,620
what day of gestation the exposure occurred. Right.

167
00:17:56,620 --> 00:18:01,420
So we give let's say it's the little mite which is the developmental toxicant that we'll talk about.

168
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:10,749
We give like a high dose of to promote it day ten. We might expect to see based on the again, the trajectory of the development of these organs,

169
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:22,159
like 35% of the litter having brain defects, 33% having eye defects in on down based on 6% urogenital defects.

170
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:28,819
So you could see that here and all the way down to you would not to expect to see palate defects.

171
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:36,760
So that's like the top of the formation of the top of the mouth. You wouldn't expect to see that because the palate is not formed yet at that stage.

172
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:43,540
So you're not gonna expect to see defects in that if the exposure occurred on day ten in the rat.

173
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:47,650
So does that make sense? Yeah.

174
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:58,980
Okay. And so the major effects of prenatal exposure to toxicants that we can observe, you know, they're pretty varied.

175
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:08,310
So like embryo lethality, you know, you can just have loss of the embryo, major malformations, restrictions on growth, cognitive deficits.

176
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:16,890
We can see things like hyperactivity, reproductive defect defects, which we talked about in the reproductive lecture and even cancers.

177
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:25,379
So. I've been talking a lot about like sort of pregnant rats in these pregnant rat

178
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:29,950
models because obviously during pregnancy is when this development takes place.

179
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:38,650
So there's this really. Important link between maternal health and fetal health and developmental health, right?

180
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:46,060
So any kind of stressor during development could occur through a couple of different sort of pathways.

181
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:56,770
So exposure to, say, mercury in the diet of the mom could potentially, you know, if the you know,

182
00:19:56,770 --> 00:20:03,520
if you if you understand the kinetics of, say, like methylmercury could potentially directly impact the developing fetus.

183
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,760
Right. The mercury itself could be impacting the fetus.

184
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:14,230
I mean, causing toxic effects and damage within that within the fetus as it's developing.

185
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:22,629
But you could also have damage to the pregnant mother, which could influence the development of the fetus.

186
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:22,870
Right.

187
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:31,870
So if you impact the ability of, for instance, the ability of the mother to deliver blood to the placenta, to nourish the fetus as it's growing,

188
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:38,380
that could impact the development of the fetus, even though the chemical itself might be not directly causing the damage.

189
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:44,860
Does that make sense? So there's a little bit it becomes kind of blurry in terms of where what a toxic particularly is targeting.

190
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:48,940
Is it doing something to the health of the mother that's impacting the fetus during pregnancy?

191
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:56,260
Or is the toxicant itself directly getting into the amniotic fluid, for example, like crossing the placenta,

192
00:20:56,260 --> 00:21:02,110
getting into the amniotic fluid or into the umbilical cord and being delivered directly to the fetus and causing damage that may.

193
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:09,560
So and these types of stressors we can talk about might be something like a toxic hit.

194
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:17,090
But as we sort of talked about in the last lecture, things like psychosocial stress on the mom can have impacts as well.

195
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:25,339
We've seen lots of studies showing that psychosocial stress can have impacts on fetal growth or on fetal development and then things in the diet.

196
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:30,860
Right. So nutritional status could also adversely impact development.

197
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:37,600
These labels here. I don't know how familiar you might be with like developmental types of studies,

198
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:48,700
but we just label the different generations with the zero for the pregnant individual, and then the developing fetus would be the f one generation.

199
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:52,390
So it could talk about effects on the F zero generation or the F one generation.

200
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:57,370
And then in the case of, say, a developing female fetus,

201
00:21:57,370 --> 00:22:03,309
there's actually another generation of two generation which are the oocytes which are developing in utero.

202
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:13,810
So you a chemical exposure potentially could impact like three generations in one pregnant individual for F zero up to the two generation.

203
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:20,940
Oh. So it all makes sense.

204
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:33,680
Well, can you go back to slide? So we're talking about specific stratagems and like the date of exposure.

205
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:37,270
I'm guessing that varies based on the chemical.

206
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:48,750
Like do you take into consideration when the C-Max happens and the half life like do certain chemicals have wider ranges of.

207
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:55,070
You know, days of gestation exposure where it can impact development in certain ways.

208
00:22:55,460 --> 00:23:01,040
Yeah, I think you're getting at a really good point is a lot of this is going to be this is sort of this

209
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:06,110
hypothetical situation that I'm talking about here where it's like we're assuming the chemicals like,

210
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:12,530
you know, essentially like delivered to the fetus and causing some kind of abnormality in the growth and development of a limb.

211
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:18,379
And that the but it'll it'll it could depend on a number of things that kinetics is a

212
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:23,570
good good example like does it of a pregnant individual to be exposed to a chemical.

213
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:27,320
But then it might not build up in the placenta for a number of weeks.

214
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:30,979
So that's going to you know, you're going to want to know sort of, I guess, in some sense,

215
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:35,719
the local kinetics of what's happening in the fetal placental compartment to understand,

216
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:40,550
you know, what's going on there, you may need some time for it to build up to actually cause this effect.

217
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:46,520
Another thing is the the particular mechanism by which it's causing the effect.

218
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:55,519
So if a chemical just strictly acts on say it, let's say it's an androgen receptor antagonist, right?

219
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,850
So it basically blocks the signaling of testosterone.

220
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:05,300
If we're talking about an organ that's like really testosterone plays a very small role in the development of that organ,

221
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:12,020
then that mechanism of action might not really be as relevant to, you know, some of these organs we're talking about.

222
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:17,630
So there's a lot that you kind of need to sort of dive into to really understand the full picture.

223
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:19,190
So I think that's a great point.

224
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:30,430
Just kind of expanding on that are chemicals that have like really long half lives in the body more likely to affect fetal development?

225
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:38,540
You know, like do they also have long half lives typically with the fetus so that if something is, say,

226
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:47,120
in the body for months, does it continue to have an effect on development or is it more like, you know, a certain time period?

227
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:50,990
I think certainly the I think the former of what you said,

228
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:54,440
if it's going to sticking around for a long time, it's going to be around, you know, if it's like, say,

229
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,360
uptake into the placenta,

230
00:24:56,510 --> 00:25:05,569
sort of like just is continually like released into the fetal compartment until like the embryonic fluid or like delivered via the umbilical cord.

231
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:08,270
Like you're going to have a continued effects over that time.

232
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:16,580
Um, so yeah, you might have sort of like maybe you get an initial pulse of a chemical exposure here and the chemical sticks around.

233
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:19,520
It has a half life for, I don't know, let's say a year or something.

234
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:25,459
Like in the case of like half life within the placenta, everything's going to be condensed a little bit to the nine months.

235
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:28,460
But let's say half life is like a couple a week or whatever.

236
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:31,790
Then, you know, you might be seeing effects way out here, right?

237
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:34,790
So like, yeah, that's that's a really good point.

238
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:39,560
So that's why kind of in this sort of hypothetical case, we're saying like a pulse of dread.

239
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:46,340
So like a signal sort of dose kind of assuming it gets like metabolized and excreted within a 24 hour time period.

240
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:54,020
So but certainly you're going to have to account for all that, which is, again, not an easy thing to do.

241
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:57,800
Yeah. Great question.

242
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:06,850
And again, you know, as I said before, the factors that can influence maternal health.

243
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,420
I include, you know, these things like genetics, disease, nutrition,

244
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:17,860
stress and toxic effects on the placenta and then toxic effects on the mothers that are she

245
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:23,590
is as a mom being exposed to some kind of chemical that's causing like systemic inflammation.

246
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:30,729
And you're seeing like this overactivation of like immune cells that might be attacking like, you know,

247
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:36,640
are affecting the function of like placental cells and that could have this indirect impact on the development of the fetus.

248
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:46,150
So this is kind of just walking through what I just talked about.

249
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:56,410
So, you know, this is kind of how we sort of go back to like integrating or trying to think about how nothing happens sort of in a vacuum.

250
00:26:56,530 --> 00:27:05,829
You know, in public health, like in our toxicology studies, we can isolate animals and, you know, kind of control the environment.

251
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:08,470
But when we're really thinking about like public health effects,

252
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:17,529
the toxicant exposure is going to be sort of interacting with various maternal susceptibility factors that may be affecting her underlying health.

253
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:22,149
So this could be like the age of the individual, her genetic background, stress,

254
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:25,990
nutritional status, etc., other exposures, other chemicals that they're exposed to.

255
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:30,069
And so there's a couple of things to think about stemming from.

256
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:36,790
So we have this toxicant exposure and then interacting with like the underlying health status of the individual.

257
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:44,350
If the toxicant is delivered to the placenta, the placenta, the toxicant can have direct impacts on the placenta.

258
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:50,229
And there's a number of different things that we study in our lab related to, you know, what can arise from this.

259
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:53,680
And things like reduced size of the placenta, reduced blood flow,

260
00:27:54,010 --> 00:28:03,639
reduced transport of certain really important factors that the fetus needs to develop altered metabolism within the placenta.

261
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,340
Right. And so all of that could contribute to abnormal development.

262
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:16,000
And then again, this toxicant individual interaction could also impact the maternal effects.

263
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:23,740
So we have a number of, you know, maternal effects here, things like disrupting the endocrine balance or decreased uterine blood flow.

264
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:30,670
All of that could have indirect developmental toxicity on the development of the of the organism.

265
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:37,200
Right. So that so that's just again, this is not something I want you to memorize, per se.

266
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:44,120
I would just like you to be able to kind of understand if there's anything in here that seems sort of like it's not making sense,

267
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:48,270
like come talk to me. But I think it's all pretty straightforward for the most part.

268
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:56,370
Yeah. Okay.

269
00:28:56,370 --> 00:29:03,959
So we'll talk about a couple examples of strategies. I mean, these are all like really sad cases that, you know, there's others we could go into.

270
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:10,530
But so this is some examples of some of the classical strategies, right?

271
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:20,430
So we have sort of like things related to like dietary or like behavioral things like maternal trauma and metabolic event imbalances like,

272
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:28,559
you know, alcoholism or diabetes, infections with pathogens, which we don't really get into much in this course.

273
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:36,690
But that's always something to think about. You know, things like Zika virus, for example, and then we have drugs and chemicals or toxicology.

274
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:42,290
So that's kind of where we work, where we're focused radiation and, you know,

275
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:47,700
just lots of different things can impact and are considered to be true antigens.

276
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:54,100
So causing excess. We'll focus on the ones that are in the rectangles here.

277
00:29:54,120 --> 00:30:01,110
So alcohol exposure diet the best are all it's already talked about a little bit and then thalidomide.

278
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:09,399
So we talked about diagnostic best role in the reproductive lecture,

279
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:15,310
but just to kind of walk through this again because it's relevant here, I'll call it the.

280
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:23,050
So as was administered to 2 to 3 million pregnant women in the United States from roughly like the forties to the seventies,

281
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:31,940
and it was used to prevent miscarriages and individuals that were had had a problem with like recurrent miscarriages.

282
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:44,200
Right. And it turned out, sadly, that later on, what we call sometimes these daughters or the children that were in utero,

283
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:53,020
like developing fetuses at the time, had a host of reproductive related health outcomes when they grew up.

284
00:30:53,470 --> 00:31:02,680
And so you could see this example, some examples here. So this is the rates of infertility in these daughters compared to the unexposed women.

285
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:13,540
So higher rates of infertility, less of the disease, exposed women were able to do you know, had a full term delivery.

286
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:20,050
So higher rates of preterm birth. In other words, in the US exposed women at higher risk, more than double the rate of miscarriage.

287
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:28,030
In addition, we had increases in adeno sarcoma of the vagina, which is a pretty rare cancer.

288
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:32,890
And so sadly, that was also found a lot in these the daughters.

289
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:42,230
So again, you know, this window of susceptibility to exposure to the there were some health effects that were seen in the mothers that took it,

290
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:47,540
but it was much more pronounced in the daughters. And so they were uniquely susceptible to this chemical.

291
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:56,970
And probably does anyone remember like what the US acts like in the body?

292
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,990
Like it's sort of like a mechanism to extract estrogen, right?

293
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:10,709
It's like more potent than the natural, you know, the endogenous estrogen.

294
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:15,210
Right. So it's like I believe I can't remember if it's 20 or 40 times more potent.

295
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:19,000
So if you think about development, you know,

296
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:22,739
the development of these like reproductive organs in utero that are driven

297
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:27,000
by estrogens and you're exposed to a chemical that's like a potent estrogen,

298
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:35,440
it sort of makes sense that you're going to see a lot of these developmental processes basically knocked off track, so to speak.

299
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:40,170
That also led to the feminization of malfeasance, too, to.

300
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:43,889
There were some effects in males, I believe.

301
00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:48,990
Yeah, I think it's I can't remember the specific male repro outcomes.

302
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:53,430
I want to say things like crypt organism and hyperspace is, but I'm not 100% on that.

303
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:58,320
I'd have to go back and double check. I think there might have been like some infertility or low sperm count issues.

304
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:09,180
Um, it's apparently, you know, my understanding is it's sort of less pronounced or like less, you know, the case of the females.

305
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:14,219
But yeah, there is definitely so there's these daughters and then a son and I think maybe

306
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:18,480
we just haven't done enough studies to fully understand what happened there.

307
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:22,320
But yeah. Great point. Yeah.

308
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:28,290
So. Okay, any questions you can sense?

309
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:35,250
Cool. Okay. So I think probably a lot of us are familiar with the concept of fetal alcohol syndrome,

310
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:39,630
where we have pregnant women to not consume alcohol while they're pregnant.

311
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:47,730
It's a fairly prevalent syndrome, like, you know, one to estimated from like 1 to 300 to 1 to 900 live births.

312
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:58,710
So the syndrome includes like certain facial anomalies that we sort of identified can include heart malformations and other sort of adverse outcomes.

313
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:06,570
So this ethanol exposure during pregnancy disrupts certain cell signaling mechanisms.

314
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,690
And I want to talk about that next. So we don't know.

315
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:22,809
We still kind of don't know a lot about how why ethanol has this affects like developmental toxins like this is probably the

316
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:28,480
area where we like there's like so much more work to be done compared to like a lot of the other topics we're going to cover.

317
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:35,590
But what we do know is like a plausible sort of mechanism for ethanol causing this fetal alcohol

318
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:41,440
syndrome is ethanol is metabolized in the body by an enzyme called alcohol dehydrogenase.

319
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:48,280
So we talked about that. Right. And so that is what you know, this is like the metabolic pathways of ethanol.

320
00:34:49,030 --> 00:35:00,730
You eventually metabolize it to acetic acid. If there's a form of vitamin A called retinol that is also metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase,

321
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:08,410
that is eventually it goes along a similar metabolic pathway to yield retinoic acid,

322
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:19,960
which is this vitamin A metabolite which is really critical to driving cell signaling during certain developmental events in utero.

323
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:30,700
And so the idea is that ethanol is competitively basically, you know, competing with this alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme, competing with the retinol.

324
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:37,120
And so you get less of the formation of this retinoic acid in the presence of like higher levels of ethanol, right?

325
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:41,680
So these retinoic acid bind to these transcription factors.

326
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:50,290
You talk about transcription factors, these proteins that bind to DNA and basically turn on transcription of lots of different genes.

327
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:58,390
And, you know, it works with some other like partners, you know, other molecules.

328
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:01,900
But essentially it's, you know,

329
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:09,130
stimulating like the transcription of genes involved in the growth regulation and the control and control in development.

330
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:17,490
And so you're having basically there's a competition between ethanol and retinol, and the ethanol is winning out.

331
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:23,500
And you're not you're not getting as much stimulation of this like retinoic acid signaling pathway, if you will.

332
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:29,350
So that's a big one that is thought to play a role in this fetal alcohol syndrome mechanism.

333
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:36,560
As with a lot of chemicals, ethanol can also contribute to the formation of reactive oxygen species,

334
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:42,090
which is that's a pretty common thing to happen in terms of like just metabolizing certain toxicants.

335
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:46,500
There's a certain degree of like oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species that are generated.

336
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:55,979
So that may play a role as well by like stimulating or like damaging cell membranes or triggering apoptosis mechanisms in that sense.

337
00:36:55,980 --> 00:37:01,310
So there's still some things we don't know, but this is one of the main mechanisms that we're thinking about there.

338
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:07,430
Makes sense. Cool. Cool. Any comments, comments or questions I got?

339
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:13,430
Remember to ask for comments as well. Any thoughts? Well.

340
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:22,140
There's a really sad case of developmental toxicity toxicology from Minamata Bay in Japan.

341
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:29,580
So this is a case of methylmercury. So post-World War Two, there's a lot of industrialization in Japan.

342
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:33,479
And one of the areas was around this, like Minamata Bay,

343
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:38,970
which had a lot of industry that was disposing of mercury, just kind of basically dumping it into the bay.

344
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:48,569
What happened was the the form of mercury that was dumped into the bay was methylated by bacteria.

345
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:54,000
So bacteria will metabolize toxicants the same way, not the exact same way, but in a similar way that we do.

346
00:37:54,570 --> 00:38:03,180
They basically methylated the mercury, so that's a carbon with like three hydrogens attached to it added to that mercury.

347
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:07,860
What happens when that happens is the method of the methylmercury becomes more lipophilic

348
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:13,420
and so it can be uptake in into the body much more efficiently than the other form.

349
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:17,300
Right. And what happens is this. It's more.

350
00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:22,860
Well. So that would be the organic form, mercury. The initial form that was dumped is called the inorganic form.

351
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:30,479
So it's methylated to this organic form of mercury, became lipophilic and then undergoes what we call bio magnification.

352
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:36,230
So it's like increasing through the food chain. And what was initially seen.

353
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:45,530
I think there were initial reports of cats that were like eating fish out of the bay and they ended up like of like really severe toxicity,

354
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:48,770
like mercury related toxicity. And then it happened in humans as well.

355
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:55,490
So pregnant women who ate the contaminated fish ended up giving birth to babies with like neurodevelopmental impacts,

356
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:59,969
skeletal defects and just a host of health problems.

357
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:09,580
So that's like this super, super sad case that, you know, we can see these like striking pictures here of this case, of this amount of bay.

358
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:16,640
So this really hits home how important knowing like the mechanisms or, you know,

359
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:24,050
dealing with these issues like in a public health sense can be you know, it's just really devastating to see these types of images.

360
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:34,770
So we also have the case of thalidomide, which was this I always get thalidomide and mixed up.

361
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:41,720
And in terms of what they are used for, so, so little mine was the one that was used to ease morning sickness in pregnant women.

362
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:52,200
This ended up causing malformations listed here, like in malformations, congenital heart disease, intestinal impact, kidney impacts.

363
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:57,450
The most striking thing was the impacts on the development of the limbs in the long bones.

364
00:39:57,540 --> 00:40:05,190
So you could see an example here of, you know, just the long bones and not develop into fully functional arms.

365
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:11,850
A really important sort of thing to understand is that there was no toxicity apparent in the adults.

366
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:16,050
Right. So the impacts were only seen in the next generation.

367
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:25,000
So a lot of this toxicity from thalidomide is.

368
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:34,170
Related to oxidative stress that was observed at certain like really high levels of oxidative stress that were observed at certain parts times,

369
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:44,089
the timing in development. Right. And so this goes back to the glutathione conjugation pathway that we talked about, if you recall.

370
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:53,900
So this glutathione known conjugation pathway is kind of one of the main metabolic detoxification pathways in the liver.

371
00:40:54,740 --> 00:41:04,400
And we need a certain form of glutathione on that to have this reaction and for this detoxification pathway to work correctly.

372
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:11,540
So we need a high ratio of this reduced versus the oxidized version of good around like in our and in our liver.

373
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:14,989
And so this is what is needed for good sound conjugation.

374
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:25,070
And it plays so many different roles in sort of like maintaining, you know, metabolic capacity, like antioxidant detoxification, metabolism, etc.

375
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:29,930
So that's just an important point I need to talk about for a jump to this next slide.

376
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:39,890
So oxidative stress is associated with the sensitivity to thalidomide and then transgenic effects, right?

377
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:49,940
And so if we were to look into rats, it actually was actually found that rats are insensitive to this thalidomide impacts on limb development.

378
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:54,440
And it turned out that thalidomide didn't have an effect on the race.

379
00:41:54,560 --> 00:42:01,070
This like GSA, this reduced oxidized version of the final ratio in rat embryonic limbs.

380
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:06,170
And so just basically, you know, just didn't cause the same effect.

381
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:11,480
However, if we were to look at rabbits, those they are actually sensitive.

382
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:22,250
So we see that in rats thalidomide decreases the nuclear reduced to oxidized ratio of glue to on in rabbit embryonic gliomas.

383
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:32,510
So this is sort of highlights why for chemicals we need to be understanding across and for a for like developmental toxicity endpoints

384
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:39,250
we need to understand effects in more than one animal species because we might not pick it up and say we only looked at rats.

385
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:40,610
We wouldn't pick it up with a little body.

386
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:47,389
We need to look at two species that could have more confidence that if we're not seeing an effect on either of those species,

387
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:51,050
that that chemical, there might not be a lot of evidence for that to be a developmental toxicant.

388
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:58,610
This is a great illustration of why we want to look across multiple species, because it's not the same between rats and humans all the time.

389
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:06,260
That sort of. Makes sense, right? Such.

390
00:43:08,350 --> 00:43:08,890
Okay.

391
00:43:10,430 --> 00:43:18,680
So that leads us into we talked about the developmental origins of health and disease last time a little bit, I believe Dr. Perera talked about that.

392
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:24,790
But I just wanted to touch back on it again, just to make sure that we went over all the points there.

393
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:29,900
So this developmental origin of origins of health and disease concept or doh had,

394
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:39,320
you'll hear it called sometimes just the idea that exposures in utero can lead to adverse health outcomes later in life.

395
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:44,630
So basically, you know, you can see here you're marching through time and you know,

396
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:50,900
prior to like one year of birth, we would have an exposure in utero and we would not know.

397
00:43:51,770 --> 00:43:59,479
So exposure to a particular teratogenic in utero and then we might not pick up on some of these adverse health outcomes

398
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:07,070
related to what happened at these developmental during this developmental toxicity period until later in life.

399
00:44:07,070 --> 00:44:11,780
Right. So you might have an impact on something like the development of the lungs or the development of the

400
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:17,000
brain that we're not able to fully understand until that individual has grown up to a certain age.

401
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:19,150
And you can kind of see some examples here.

402
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:26,110
So if exposure is going to sort of increase someone's risk for Alzheimer's later in life for Parkinson's, you know,

403
00:44:26,270 --> 00:44:31,640
we might not be diagnosing that until much later or we're definitely not can be diagnosing it too much later.

404
00:44:32,090 --> 00:44:43,010
And there's evidence for exposures or developmental impacts early in life, sort of increasing the risk for all of these health outcomes.

405
00:44:43,010 --> 00:44:48,740
So it's this huge area of environmental health, like developmental biology, where we're really,

406
00:44:49,070 --> 00:44:59,990
really sort of only beginning to understand how environmental exposures or other types of adverse events in utero affect health later in life.

407
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:03,999
And so it's in some sense, you know,

408
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:13,380
reversing what we have done in the past where we see an outcome and then try to sort of deal with the outcome after it manifests.

409
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:17,410
What we're trying to do now is think about how we can prevent these outcomes from

410
00:45:17,410 --> 00:45:22,000
manifesting at all like later in life or reducing the risk for these events later.

411
00:45:22,870 --> 00:45:29,830
Have. Have any of you all like. Of had before by just rehashing something you've already heard or what's your like familiar

412
00:45:29,950 --> 00:45:36,850
level of familiar familiarity with the DOE had hypothesis that the DOE had world.

413
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:42,950
Anyone heard of it at all before today? Hands one of people.

414
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:50,330
Okay, well, cool. It wasn't just like repeating something you've heard a million times before, so that's good.

415
00:45:50,930 --> 00:45:52,690
But it's. Ah, it's really, I don't know.

416
00:45:52,700 --> 00:46:02,570
I find it super fascinating, this idea of understanding how we can help hopefully prevent disease by addressing things very early in life.

417
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:11,500
So. SH Yeah.

418
00:46:11,510 --> 00:46:17,690
So this goes back to, you know, feels like we're like and so it's like think about these slides of like thinking

419
00:46:17,690 --> 00:46:21,079
about like we're putting like a lot of burden on the pregnant individual here,

420
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:30,170
but it's just kind of how it works. So these effects on like maternal exposures have various impacts on the offspring, right?

421
00:46:30,170 --> 00:46:32,510
So we can talk through things like obesity,

422
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:39,979
can alter has altered things that you might not even think so maternal obesity could impact the in the case of a female fetus like

423
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:50,990
the oocyte development or the overall embryo redox state and then growth in metabolism later in life after birth social behaviors.

424
00:46:50,990 --> 00:46:57,020
So again we someone had brought up a psychosocial stress like that is 100% a super you know,

425
00:46:57,020 --> 00:47:05,270
there's tons of studies showing that maternal stress can impact the trajectory of the developing fetus.

426
00:47:05,810 --> 00:47:12,080
Um, an impact like behavioral of the behavioral behavior of the offspring later in life.

427
00:47:12,530 --> 00:47:20,450
Smoking, I think we're all aware of like the health risks of smoking while pregnant and then chemical exposures, right.

428
00:47:22,770 --> 00:47:25,709
But there are maternal paternal exposures to think about as well.

429
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:32,940
So impacts on the sperm work finding can also lead to impacts on the embryo and later in life development as well.

430
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:37,170
But it's not quite as well studied, but hopefully we'll learn more as we go.

431
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:43,000
So. Yeah. So this really brings together that.

432
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:48,159
Again, going back to that earlier slide where we talked about the expose all about how all of these things

433
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:55,660
in addition to environmental toxicants kind of add up to the sort of someone's exposed home or,

434
00:47:55,910 --> 00:48:04,300
you know, someone's health, health status, if you will, or where they are in terms of their risks for particular adverse outcomes.

435
00:48:06,230 --> 00:48:10,830
Cool. Cool. Okay.

436
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:14,790
And again, this is just showing the different.

437
00:48:17,930 --> 00:48:21,620
Like risks like odds ratio and percent affected of.

438
00:48:22,070 --> 00:48:28,790
I'm not sure where the study came from to be honest with you. Um, with, uh, with smoking on various like adverse outcomes.

439
00:48:28,790 --> 00:48:39,250
So we have like low birth weight obesity, percentage of obesity later in life, uh, sudden infant death syndrome and type two diabetes.

440
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:45,200
Right. And you can see one thing that's like a big principle of toxicology is the dose response, right?

441
00:48:45,830 --> 00:48:50,930
And so if we if we are identifying a particular exposure as being associated with a health outcome.

442
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:55,190
Understanding the dose response is really important. If there's no dose response,

443
00:48:55,190 --> 00:49:02,960
then we're very kind of often suspect of the data that is that really correlated with that health outcome or associated with that health outcome.

444
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:08,030
If we're not seeing because kind of intuitively we know if you're exposed to higher levels of most things,

445
00:49:08,030 --> 00:49:11,390
you're going to see a higher rate of like adverse outcomes.

446
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:19,310
Unless we're talking about the U-shaped dose response curve right here, you have a pretty clear dose response, if you will,

447
00:49:19,610 --> 00:49:28,070
with higher numbers of cigaret smoke per day, leading to a higher risk for a host of health outcomes as shown here.

448
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:35,130
So that makes sense. So.

449
00:49:37,390 --> 00:49:41,830
Toxicological testing for developmental toxicity is a really interesting field,

450
00:49:41,830 --> 00:49:47,350
if that's something you're interesting interested in because you can imagine, for instance,

451
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:51,400
if you want to understand whether a chemical is a liver toxicant,

452
00:49:51,910 --> 00:49:57,730
you can tell a fairly good amount by culturing a single like hepatocyte cell line

453
00:49:57,910 --> 00:50:02,410
and exposing the hepatocytes to a toxicant and measuring some kind of outcome.

454
00:50:03,130 --> 00:50:13,120
But development because, as I said earlier, is this highly coordinated and dynamic process that incorporates lots of different cells of the model.

455
00:50:14,170 --> 00:50:20,319
The models that we use tend to be kind of more like sophisticated or kind of more, more interesting.

456
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:24,730
I don't know my opinion than some of the models we use for other types of toxicity.

457
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:29,350
So these include things like culturing in vitro, like embryonic stem cells.

458
00:50:29,890 --> 00:50:36,160
So we know if a toxic is impacting stem cells, that has a high potential to impact the development of the organism.

459
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:43,990
We can derive these from mice or humans. We can also tell them to differentiate in certain passed down certain pathways and see

460
00:50:43,990 --> 00:50:48,010
how chemicals are impacting either the differentiated cell or the undifferentiated cell.

461
00:50:49,490 --> 00:51:00,620
We have what's called ex vivo culture, where we can take whole rodent embryos and actually like sort of artificially culture them outside of the

462
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:07,430
mom and then basically look at how the organs develop after we treat the embryo with certain chemicals.

463
00:51:07,930 --> 00:51:12,259
There's a lot of sophisticated imaging technology that goes along with that record label,

464
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:16,909
certain cell types, and see how those are migrating, like the bullet fluoresce.

465
00:51:16,910 --> 00:51:22,670
And then we can kind of like quantify or just visualize how they're migrating over the course of development.

466
00:51:25,130 --> 00:51:30,860
Yeah, it can take what are called like lim buds, which are like these primordial like limb structures and see how those are impacted.

467
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:39,650
And we can like culture, those in vitro as well. There's also a number of organisms from the seafloor which are flies.

468
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:51,200
Zebrafish are a big one with in utero for our developmental time testing and our kind of old standbys, the rodents and the rabbits.

469
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:56,840
So we kind of we use a lot of different models to try to understand these processes.

470
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:05,030
So with that, we'll switch over to pesticides and we will definitely, probably not make it through all of that.

471
00:52:05,570 --> 00:52:09,980
But since we're switching topics, I'd like to just take a five minute break.

472
00:52:10,130 --> 00:52:15,380
If anyone wants to go to the bathroom, we can just reconvene here at 11.

473
00:52:16,370 --> 00:52:23,419
And if anyone has any questions, if I went over anything too fast, you can start and we'll talk about it or you can stay in your seat, too.

474
00:52:23,420 --> 00:52:26,420
But just let's just take a break and press pause and come back.

475
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:35,090
Thank you for.

476
00:52:40,260 --> 00:54:11,640
He's. Around.

477
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:31,870
Because this, see?

478
00:54:45,430 --> 00:55:09,780
She says she's going. It's easier to do it because you still.

479
00:55:15,630 --> 00:55:32,480
Speaking. In other words, would you like something else want to say?

480
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:40,930
Did you get a where you came?

481
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:49,800
I think you're always do. I mean, it's okay.

482
00:55:52,090 --> 00:56:08,060
It's going to be okay.

483
00:56:08,230 --> 00:56:24,990
Do you think that you would have.

484
00:56:33,110 --> 00:56:40,650
I think you do. I do.

485
00:56:43,430 --> 00:56:46,920
Oh, yeah. Oh, through Stuart.

486
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:52,610
Oh, I forgot about you.

487
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:58,010
Right. Well, I suppose they came first.

488
00:57:23,170 --> 00:57:41,000
You're going to have to do one thing.

489
00:57:46,740 --> 00:58:17,560
So yeah, it's like, okay, thanks for not taking off to go trick or treating early coming back.

490
00:58:20,110 --> 00:58:23,410
Yeah. So we'll jump into pesticides now and.

491
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:28,870
Yeah. So pesticides.

492
00:58:30,130 --> 00:58:37,360
Probably aware are used to protect crops or eliminate vectors of disease, for example, for vector borne diseases.

493
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:43,570
Thinking about like DDT used to kill mosquitoes that can spread malaria.

494
00:58:43,870 --> 00:58:54,279
Right. So often they are used as multi-agent mixtures, meaning that there are multiple.

495
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:59,770
There is the active form or active ingredient in the pesticide mixture,

496
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:07,240
which is the thing that's actually causing like the molecular change in the organism to kill it, right?

497
00:59:07,390 --> 00:59:14,740
Blocking some kind of receptor or something to that effect. That is the main mechanism of action of that pesticide.

498
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:26,280
Sorry. Getting a buzz here. Although with that there is usually inert ingredients which are part of sort of like what the manufacture

499
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:32,040
will include to make the pesticide easier to apply in whatever setting it's being applied in.

500
00:59:32,340 --> 00:59:36,960
So it's like, like I don't feel like an agricultural crop or whatever.

501
00:59:38,580 --> 00:59:41,010
Yeah. And so there's lots of often be like, you know,

502
00:59:41,010 --> 00:59:49,470
additional solvents or like oils or something that allow it to just basically be handled and used in the way that it was meant to be used.

503
00:59:50,910 --> 00:59:58,559
And so an important point when you're thinking about the toxicology of a pesticide is to not just think about that active ingredient,

504
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:03,480
but to also think about the inert ingredients that might be in that mixture as well.

505
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:11,579
Because we've seen that some of these inert, supposedly inert ingredients can also have toxic effects and,

506
01:00:11,580 --> 01:00:16,680
you know, potentially interact with other parts of the mixture to cause some kind of health outcomes.

507
01:00:19,380 --> 01:00:23,460
And hopefully that's the last one is turn this off.

508
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:32,530
Sorry about that. Right.

509
01:00:32,530 --> 01:00:35,700
So pesticides are toxic. They're designed to be toxic, right?

510
01:00:35,710 --> 01:00:41,260
They're used to kill plants or weeds or certain types of animals.

511
01:00:41,590 --> 01:00:45,879
Right. Some types of fungus. So they're designed to be toxic.

512
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:50,290
So we shouldn't really be that surprised that there are sort of off target effects

513
01:00:50,290 --> 01:00:54,070
that we see sometimes where even though a chemical is meant to be used to,

514
01:00:54,670 --> 01:01:03,280
for instance, kill mosquitoes, we see toxic effects potentially in humans or wildlife that also might be coming into contact with that pesticide.

515
01:01:06,430 --> 01:01:11,620
When we think about the use of pesticides and this really goes for a lot of the chemicals we talk about,

516
01:01:12,940 --> 01:01:18,550
we need to generally like balance what we consider,

517
01:01:18,910 --> 01:01:25,960
what we define as like an economic benefit of the use of a pesticide so we can increase crop yields,

518
01:01:28,540 --> 01:01:31,419
feed more people, kind of taking it out of the realm of just economics.

519
01:01:31,420 --> 01:01:38,920
But, you know, if you're able to produce more crops and feed more people on a smaller plot of land, obviously that's considered to be a benefit.

520
01:01:39,460 --> 01:01:43,750
But we also need to consider the public health effects of applying that pesticide.

521
01:01:44,860 --> 01:01:49,839
Are there going to be workers that work with the pesticide that might be exposed and have health effects?

522
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:57,850
Other people that live near these agricultural areas that are exposed to these pesticides that might have effects to the pesticides,

523
01:01:57,850 --> 01:02:01,690
make it into the food and product that people are consuming.

524
01:02:02,650 --> 01:02:07,750
We don't want to be giving people food that is going to be causing bad health effects.

525
01:02:07,750 --> 01:02:15,489
Right. In addition, we need to think about and balance the eco eco toxicological impacts,

526
01:02:15,490 --> 01:02:19,900
which will be the next subject in this lecture series, eco toxicology.

527
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:25,180
But another way to say that is we need to think about the impacts of the pesticide on wildlife.

528
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:31,330
So there have been pesticides that have been associated with impacts on, say, like frogs, for example.

529
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:40,900
I talked about Rachel Carson and her noticing the impacts on birds like different types of wild birds and their ability to reproduce.

530
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:45,880
So what are these pesticides doing to the broader environment beyond just humans?

531
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:51,479
So there's risks and benefits to the application of these substances.

532
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:57,920
And we need to look. You know, a lot of the sort of answers to the questions that we have about these risks

533
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:02,300
and benefits are not really something that we can get to with purely science.

534
01:03:02,540 --> 01:03:07,660
Right. It's going to be something that we decide sort of socially and politically in a sense.

535
01:03:13,460 --> 01:03:17,970
Right. So the common classes are you've probably heard of these at some point.

536
01:03:17,990 --> 01:03:25,430
Insecticides, right? Killing insects. Herbicides, killing plants, fungicides, killing fungus, rodenticides killing rodents.

537
01:03:26,180 --> 01:03:34,499
So fairly straightforward there, I would say. And to illustrate the point I just made about risks and benefits,

538
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:45,810
I think this is a nice slide that shows malaria cases and deaths in South Africa over like roughly like a 30 or so your time period.

539
01:03:46,930 --> 01:03:52,570
So what you have here is like 1971 and you're marching through time up to 2004,

540
01:03:52,960 --> 01:04:00,470
and you see rates of both cases and deaths due to malaria, which is largely driven by mosquitoes.

541
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:09,099
Right. And so from about like the forties to fifties, up through like the beginning of the slide in the seventies,

542
01:04:09,100 --> 01:04:11,950
you're starting to see this like chemical boom,

543
01:04:11,980 --> 01:04:19,780
post-World War Two, manufacturing lots of different chemicals for various purposes, including pesticides, including DDT.

544
01:04:19,900 --> 01:04:27,190
Right. Which can which is an insect insecticide that is really good at targeting and killing mosquitoes.

545
01:04:27,910 --> 01:04:32,590
And so you could see this like application. These are the years in which DDT was applied.

546
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:36,460
This is a species of mosquitoes. So this like disappears in South Africa.

547
01:04:38,140 --> 01:04:43,990
So you're basically the application of DDT and then, you know, around say like the nineties,

548
01:04:43,990 --> 01:04:48,309
like the early nineties or so, we start to gain a better understanding of that.

549
01:04:48,310 --> 01:04:56,290
DDT being released into the environment also came with some impacts on wildlife and potentially health impacts for those that are exposed.

550
01:04:56,530 --> 01:05:03,940
We talked about how some of the metabolites of DDT have like endocrine disrupting properties just as an example.

551
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:09,730
So people became concerned about releasing like tons of this DDT into the environment.

552
01:05:10,950 --> 01:05:17,040
And so it was DDT was replaced with a different class of pesticides called pyrethroids.

553
01:05:18,150 --> 01:05:21,750
And it turned out that these were not as efficient at killing mosquitoes as DDT was.

554
01:05:22,470 --> 01:05:32,790
And so the and there was actually a pyrethroid resistant species of mosquito that came out that appeared.

555
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:40,049
And what you saw was this sharp increase in deaths due to mold cases and deaths due to malaria after DDT was

556
01:05:40,050 --> 01:05:46,500
banned or just stopped being used overall and then DDT was reintroduced and you saw the cases go down again.

557
01:05:46,980 --> 01:05:52,110
So I think this illustrates the point that I was making on the earlier slide about.

558
01:05:53,610 --> 01:06:00,720
The costs and benefit of using these pesticides. So obviously malaria is bad and contributing to deaths and sickness.

559
01:06:01,710 --> 01:06:07,680
But DDT also has health effects on humans and other wildlife.

560
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:17,700
So how do we understand those? How do we use how do we decide on the appropriate usage of DDT and what is the cost benefit ratio there?

561
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:20,040
And how do we how do we address this problem?

562
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:27,429
You know, just as an example, someone may look at this and say maybe there's a third way to control malaria spread or,

563
01:06:27,430 --> 01:06:32,650
you know, control mosquito disease borne diseases caused by mosquitoes.

564
01:06:32,710 --> 01:06:35,980
You know, we talk we hear about mosquito nets and things like this.

565
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:43,380
So. There is a lot to take in and consider when we talk about the use of pesticides.

566
01:06:44,070 --> 01:06:49,960
Makes sense. Questions or comments. Okay.

567
01:06:53,080 --> 01:07:00,180
Yes. I got everything I wanted to. A landslide. This is just showing an annual pesticide consumption or use across.

568
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:04,959
You know, we're not getting data from everywhere here, but like, you know, kind of not surprisingly,

569
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:12,090
China, the US are using kind of the top consumers in terms of like millions of kilograms applied.

570
01:07:13,090 --> 01:07:16,180
This is back in 2015. I'm not sure if this picture has changed at all.

571
01:07:16,210 --> 01:07:24,100
But just to give you, you know, kind of the scale of the application of these chemicals across the world.

572
01:07:24,940 --> 01:07:30,610
But again, we had a lot of these when you look at these maps, we have big gaps in our knowledge and data there.

573
01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:37,130
So. So these are some of the commonly used pesticides in the U.S.

574
01:07:37,910 --> 01:07:44,780
There's actually a little update we probably need to make compared to the book listing Chlorpyrifos,

575
01:07:44,780 --> 01:07:49,490
because Chlorpyrifos was recently banned on food products in the United States.

576
01:07:49,790 --> 01:07:53,540
And we'll talk about the toxicity related. The culprit yet we're still using atrazine.

577
01:07:53,900 --> 01:07:58,610
Sorry, are we still using atrazine? Gosh, that's a good question.

578
01:07:58,860 --> 01:08:02,270
I don't I think I want to say yes, but I would need to double check that.

579
01:08:03,410 --> 01:08:06,740
Yeah, sorry about that. Yeah. I'm not quite sure what the stance on that one is.

580
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:19,440
Yeah. So example pesticides include. Yeah. So you'll see like chlorpyrifos, smell fired insecticides, herbicides, glyphosate, atrazine, fungicides.

581
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:24,450
There's a couple things I just wanted to highlight here on this list of chemicals.

582
01:08:24,450 --> 01:08:29,880
You see millions of pounds of usage here as well. Right. So a couple of things I wanted to highlight here.

583
01:08:30,900 --> 01:08:36,360
Um, one thing is that there are types of pesticides we use that are actually just kind of like a physical.

584
01:08:36,900 --> 01:08:44,640
Well, they use like a physical mechanism of action where you essentially coat the insect with like a thick oil and it basically suffocates them.

585
01:08:44,850 --> 01:08:48,989
They die that way. It's not via this like molecular pathway activity.

586
01:08:48,990 --> 01:08:53,400
It's just kind of this like physical effect. So that's kind of interesting.

587
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:58,490
Of the EPA within the last couple of years recently banned chlorpyrifos.

588
01:08:58,520 --> 01:09:00,050
So if you're going to talk about later on.

589
01:09:00,830 --> 01:09:11,900
On food crops due to the toxic toxicity that's associated with some fear but that's generated in toxicology studies of glyphosate.

590
01:09:12,350 --> 01:09:17,270
Another word like the commercial name for that is Roundup, which you will see like if you go to a Home Depot,

591
01:09:17,270 --> 01:09:22,370
you'll see like you can go buy a can of roundup to apply on your weeds at home.

592
01:09:25,670 --> 01:09:29,300
And atrazine has been a very interesting and controversial one.

593
01:09:29,330 --> 01:09:36,440
Atrazine was actually where I initially started doing toxicology as an undergrad at Western Michigan University.

594
01:09:37,460 --> 01:09:46,090
I worked in the lab of a. Uh, faculty member that was kind of following up on some of the research that came out from Tyrone Hayes,

595
01:09:46,630 --> 01:09:56,620
who I don't know if you've heard of Tyrone Hayes. He's done these studies that suggest show that atrazine can essentially like.

596
01:09:57,700 --> 01:10:01,990
Contribute to endocrine disruption and change the sex of frogs.

597
01:10:04,210 --> 01:10:07,810
And then it's been a whole, you know,

598
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:14,260
back and forth between some of the manufacturers of atrazine kind of criticizing his studies and that it's like this whole,

599
01:10:14,260 --> 01:10:17,320
you know, controversy there. They don't really get into too much.

600
01:10:17,950 --> 01:10:24,609
Just a couple of notes is that, you know, one thing with frogs as they do, they can change sex.

601
01:10:24,610 --> 01:10:30,159
That's kind of like part of their normal biology depending on like things like fluctuations in the temperature of their environment.

602
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:39,700
So it's not maybe quite as weird as, you know, or quite as dramatic of an effect as you kind of first think when you hear of these frogs changing sex.

603
01:10:39,700 --> 01:10:43,299
But in. Yeah.

604
01:10:43,300 --> 01:10:52,450
So the faculty member that I worked with was sort of doing additional research on the atrazine impacts on this particular type of frog.

605
01:10:52,450 --> 01:10:56,439
And we were actually looking at, you know, we,

606
01:10:56,440 --> 01:11:05,469
I was I was just kind of helping like do like cleaning dishes and stuff that like cutting slides on the on a bike or dissector and stuff.

607
01:11:05,470 --> 01:11:10,209
But we're was the yeah.

608
01:11:10,210 --> 01:11:19,300
So some of the things that were being looked at by that lab included like impacts on like metabolic function within the frogs,

609
01:11:19,330 --> 01:11:27,250
not this endocrine disruptors. So this lab wasn't focused on the sex change thing that was happening, but Taryn Hayes was really focused on.

610
01:11:27,820 --> 01:11:35,049
So this is like an alternate toxicological endpoint, which I think is a good sort of anecdote because I think,

611
01:11:35,050 --> 01:11:40,570
you know, a lot of the media attention around atrazine got swallowed up by that one end point.

612
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:46,750
Oh, it's changing the sex of the frogs, but there's a whole host of other sort of potential impacts that maybe,

613
01:11:47,260 --> 01:11:55,840
as you know, you know, the data may be pointing to, you know, one of these other impacts, even more so than this one.

614
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:59,110
You know, some of the ones that sort of gained a lot of media attention.

615
01:11:59,740 --> 01:12:07,840
Um, because I think, you know, the lab that I worked in put out some pretty interesting data that atrazine was impacting like the nutritional,

616
01:12:07,900 --> 01:12:15,760
like metabolic status of the frogs, which maybe or maybe not have some kind of relation to the endocrine disrupting effects.

617
01:12:16,210 --> 01:12:24,880
So anyway, that's just an anecdote to kind of talk about how we think about these impacts of pesticides on wildlife and how it's

618
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:31,240
important to kind of really consider a lot of different aspects to a particular problem or side scientific the question.

619
01:12:33,230 --> 01:12:39,990
Okay. Just a couple more minutes so we can think through.

620
01:12:40,980 --> 01:12:48,330
And I think that some of a lot of this is probably fairly intuitive how people can be exposed to pesticides.

621
01:12:48,900 --> 01:12:58,740
This can happen through the air. You know, we could be treating a like a plot of crops with with a pesticide.

622
01:12:58,740 --> 01:13:04,080
And we can have, you know, the wind carrying some of the particles of these pesticides into the air.

623
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:05,880
And we can have inhalation.

624
01:13:06,270 --> 01:13:14,040
This could be happening in residents that live near agricultural areas or workers that are directly working with the pesticide.

625
01:13:16,230 --> 01:13:19,230
We could have exposure via the soil. Right.

626
01:13:19,230 --> 01:13:22,350
So the chemicals are sprayed on the crops, end up in the soil.

627
01:13:22,350 --> 01:13:30,450
Some of that ends up in the soil. We could have drift again from the wind where the the pesticide is carried into like

628
01:13:30,450 --> 01:13:36,590
residential yards and ended up in the soil in nearby resident homes or directly on site.

629
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:43,320
Right. And then once a chemical is in the soil, we have a number of different exposure pathways.

630
01:13:43,980 --> 01:13:50,240
For instance, with children, children exhibit certain behaviors that such as rolling around,

631
01:13:50,250 --> 01:13:55,430
playing in the dirt, but sometimes eating dirt that are not typically observed in adults.

632
01:13:55,440 --> 01:14:00,690
So that may represent a unique exposure pathway if pesticide contamination is in the soil.

633
01:14:01,110 --> 01:14:07,380
And so with children, of course, we are also worried about developmental tox effects.

634
01:14:08,730 --> 01:14:15,840
You know, in a developing child. Right. So that could be an area of a degree, a high degree of concern.

635
01:14:16,710 --> 01:14:21,510
And then on the actual site where workers are applying the pesticide, again,

636
01:14:21,510 --> 01:14:25,830
they could be ingest ingesting or if like dirt is kind of in the air, they could be inhaling it.

637
01:14:26,220 --> 01:14:30,180
Dirt could get on the skin. So we really have all three the ingestion,

638
01:14:30,180 --> 01:14:39,960
inhalation and dermal pathways as a pathway of exposure once the pesticides like contaminated the soil or groundwater.

639
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:44,159
So chemicals can pesticides can end up in the groundwater like rain comes in,

640
01:14:44,160 --> 01:14:51,820
washes some of the pesticides off the crops or into the groundwater, into, for example, private wells.

641
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:59,610
Again, once a chemicals in water or drinking water from the tap inhalation,

642
01:14:59,610 --> 01:15:04,260
if we take a shower like a hot shower, the water vapor can be exposed that way.

643
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:10,510
Interval as well in the shower. Right. And.

644
01:15:10,530 --> 01:15:15,990
Yeah, so. So that way you have this groundwater pathway of exposure for residents and both like,

645
01:15:17,130 --> 01:15:20,340
you know, people that may have private wells or those on a public water supply.

646
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:27,170
And then there's the food pathway. Right. So we're spraying the stuff on food.

647
01:15:28,150 --> 01:15:34,880
It may potentially like drift on to like people's gardens or, you know, other, you know, food sources.

648
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:38,740
And we would get exposure via ingestion that way.

649
01:15:38,750 --> 01:15:45,440
Right. So we have exposed populations and gardeners or subsistence populations that are growing their own food, for example.

650
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:51,950
So these are the ways people can be exposed to pesticides. And I think that's probably a good place to start for today.

651
01:15:52,490 --> 01:16:02,850
And we'll pick it back up Wednesday. I'm not sure if we'll move into eco talks on Wednesday, but yeah, I think that's a good place to start.

652
01:16:02,870 --> 01:16:05,930
Happy Halloween again. And, um.

653
01:16:06,380 --> 01:16:10,290
Yeah. Need some good candy. Thanks.

654
01:16:12,110 --> 01:16:16,580
And remember that office hours will be shortened to 432 five.
