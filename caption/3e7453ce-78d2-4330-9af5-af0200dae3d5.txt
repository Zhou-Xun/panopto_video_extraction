1
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,670
My heart is.

2
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:46,020
Okay. Yeah.

3
00:00:48,320 --> 00:01:31,860
You know. Okay.

4
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:39,030
Good morning. I hope you had a good, uh, study break.

5
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:53,090
And, um. So, um, I have some stats on the midterm.

6
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:57,400
You like to see them? Yeah. Okay. Before.

7
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:02,390
Uh. Is a leader here. Leader Norton.

8
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:07,900
Hello? Oh, yeah. Emily. Emily.

9
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:13,590
No. And Aaron. Yes.

10
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:18,150
Okay. So this is these are the stats.

11
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:26,100
You did well overall. Congrats. The median was 1970 6%.

12
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:32,670
That's that's good, right? This is the interquartile range and the mode 21.

13
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,180
So the most popular score was three. That's great.

14
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:41,910
And now it's calling on those three people because they got perfect scores.

15
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:56,340
Congratulations. And it seems there is an association between maybe showing up or not to class in time and getting stand up.

16
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:02,360
All right. So and many other people got almost perfect score.

17
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:16,020
You did quite well. If if you would like to review the exams, we will centralize the process during Haley's Thursday office hours.

18
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:25,290
So feel free to sign up for those with her, and she'll be happy to go with you through the exams.

19
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:30,350
Okay. Okay, great.

20
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:35,850
So any questions or comments on the exam?

21
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:47,800
Ole, ole, ole. You know, as many Thursdays as it takes.

22
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:54,400
But we thought it is really sort of more organized to centralize like this.

23
00:03:55,870 --> 00:04:03,670
Okay. Um, all right. So today we start a new chapter in our lives.

24
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:10,690
We will begin discussing issues around Olympians.

25
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:22,030
We are done with study designs. Now we are going to study how to interpret the data and how to make us Olympians.

26
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:27,040
What are the problems that we may have and how can we address them?

27
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:31,860
Yes. Oh, I'm so.

28
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,000
Could you please go ahead and just publish whatever was?

29
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:48,469
It's the same ones that are just impervious to just click publish. Okay.

30
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:53,090
Thank you. And in so sorry. Apologize. Totally slipped my mind.

31
00:04:53,090 --> 00:05:01,190
But they are being published more or less as I speak. So while they are published, maybe I can give you the scoop of the nutshell.

32
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:06,770
Yeah. What we are going to be talking to today is effect modification.

33
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:18,920
What is effect modification? Effect modification is a situation that involves three variables.

34
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:26,210
So when you have an association between an exposure, a and an outcome, why?

35
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:42,580
That association is said to be modified to be subject to effect modification when it differs between levels of a third light.

36
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:51,390
That's a big modification. I'll give you an example. A recent real life example.

37
00:05:55,940 --> 00:06:04,450
Turns out that. COVID vaccines covering COVID vaccines induce strong.

38
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:13,030
Immune response rate and antibody response.

39
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,250
So as the exposure. COVID vaccine was the only.

40
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:24,290
The size of the antibody response that is out.

41
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:34,460
The response is stronger when the vaccine is administered in the afternoon than when it is administered in the morning.

42
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:38,840
I was you know, I was very, very amazed by that.

43
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:54,080
So we can say that the effect of the COVID vaccine on the antibody response is modified by the time of administration of the vaccine.

44
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:58,580
So the third variable is the time of administration of the vaccine.

45
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:03,420
That's it. That's a fake move because that's what we are going to talk about.

46
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:10,030
Now it has a couple of synonyms is the same as interaction.

47
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:17,880
In that example, there is an interaction between the time of administration, of the vaccine and.

48
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:20,910
The administration of the vaccine.

49
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:30,900
It is also called heterogeneity of effect, meaning the effect of the vaccine on the antibody response is heterogeneous.

50
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:38,480
By levels of. The time of the date of the ministry.

51
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:48,000
The way in which you measure it. Numerically is important because.

52
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:56,060
You could measure if equivocation in the additive scale or in the multiplicative risk.

53
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:04,620
And you may get different results. So there is a nuance that we will go through regarding the interpretation.

54
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:14,190
Of that situation when that happens. And there are basically two ways to numerically assess effect modification.

55
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:22,330
The most popular one and the most practical one, that we are still implementing ourselves,

56
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:28,900
you know, and you'll probably implement yourselves is via stratification.

57
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:32,140
What does that mean? Stratification means.

58
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:43,270
Okay, let's look at the association between exposure and outcome separately for each level of the third variable for each stratum.

59
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:47,470
So that because it's threat strata levels category is the same.

60
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:51,370
So looking at association within each stratum is called stratification.

61
00:08:53,540 --> 00:09:00,860
The other way, which is a little bit perhaps more fancy, although is algebraically equivalent is called comparing.

62
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:07,040
Observed versus expected joint effects.

63
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:11,300
And we will actually boldly go through an example of that.

64
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:18,460
Last bit of this. Natural.

65
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:32,820
A Fed modification is not a bias. Is just a fact of life that can be informative and needs to be presented as such.

66
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:44,550
Again, it's not a buy. It is not something you want to try to do away with, you know, through analysis or anything.

67
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:50,100
Not. You just want to present it. Hey, by the way, I found that there is a modification.

68
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:54,480
Might be a nice discovery. All right.

69
00:09:55,230 --> 00:10:03,420
Okay. Now, if you're ready, we can proceed with the nitty gritty details.

70
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:08,790
So we will first go back to causal effects in population subsets.

71
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:16,650
Define effect modification, provide examples of evaluation through stratification in both scales.

72
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:25,310
Then classify effect modification according to how the numbers may behave between strata, which is very interesting.

73
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:27,410
Can be quantitative or qualitative.

74
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:38,300
Then we will go through that other way to assess effect modification, which is estimating, observed and expected effects, joint effects and component.

75
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:46,620
We will discuss this concept of reciprocity and then finally a few pointers on interpretation, limitations, etc.

76
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:55,170
To begin with. Let's recall that definition of an average causal effect.

77
00:10:55,170 --> 00:11:03,910
So we discuss estimating. The average causal effect of an exposure, let's say a one an outcome way.

78
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,320
Right. Like an overall effect.

79
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:14,370
And from a public health perspective, from a practical point of view, this is actually relevant in a number of situations.

80
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:23,430
The first one is, well, let's say we have a blanket public health intervention that can reach everybody.

81
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:31,360
Right. Like salt ionization or water fluoridation.

82
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:38,500
Right. Blanket intervention that we want to reach everybody.

83
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:45,950
As many people as possible. So if that's the case, we are just okay with estimating a total average effect.

84
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:58,709
Also, we may be interested in an overall causal effect when we expect that everybody may benefit,

85
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:03,450
or at least that nobody will suffer harm from our intervention.

86
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:13,190
Right. It's relatively inexpensive and most people will benefit and nobody will be killed or hurt by the intervention.

87
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:18,180
You know, we can just be okay with that. We're all living, right?

88
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:25,610
So let's go back to that example we started working on.

89
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:30,020
You may recall. Of marijuana exposure.

90
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:34,550
It was a thing. It was an intervention, a study of marijuana.

91
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:40,310
Smoking and Alzheimer's disease. Right.

92
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:50,030
So these are the same numbers we had then, you know, 10 million people, if you will, who were exposed and another ten who are unexposed.

93
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:59,640
And we had estimated the risk, the cumulative incidence of the outcome in each group in the exposed it was five over ten in the unexposed,

94
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:07,280
it was three over ten in 30 years. And we said, well, there is an association, right?

95
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:11,440
Because the probabilities, the conditional probabilities differ.

96
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:19,219
And because we know in a randomized experiment there is exchange ability, we can assume that this association has a causal interpretation.

97
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:25,160
Right. Okay. We could quantify the magnitude of this causal effect in two scales.

98
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:33,060
In the additive scale, we could estimate the cumulative incidence difference, which is point two, right?

99
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:38,850
The difference between these two proportions and in the multiplicative scale,

100
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:44,190
we can estimate the cumulative incidence ratio, which is the ratio of these two numbers.

101
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:52,070
1.7. Okay. That's the magnitude of the effect because it's there on the right.

102
00:13:54,280 --> 00:14:06,070
But. Going back to, you know, when it is of interest to have an overall causal effect estimate sometimes we actually want.

103
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:18,970
To estimate the effect of an exposure on an outcome in subsets of the population, meaning in subgroups that are characterized by another variable.

104
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:32,380
Right. For example, when we may suspect that an intervention may work better if it is targeted to a specific subgroup.

105
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:47,720
Or when we wondered whether we could apply our results to another population where there is a different prevalence of exposure.

106
00:14:50,680 --> 00:15:00,040
Or when we suspect that perhaps the mechanisms linking the exposure with the outcome can differ between different populations.

107
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:05,090
So any of these justifications?

108
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:12,690
May be good to call to examine effects in subsets of a population.

109
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:24,790
With the case of Alzheimer's. We go to the literature and we find some interesting prior knowledge involving a subset of the population.

110
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:34,280
The result, and this is all true, by the way, and the prevalence of Alzheimer's at any age is hiring more women than in men.

111
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:40,580
Also, it tends to start earlier in women than it does in men.

112
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,700
And the presentation tends to be more severe in women than it is in men.

113
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:58,610
So. If marijuana smoking has anything to do with Alzheimer's and given this situation, it might be of interest.

114
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:03,160
To examine what the effect of marijuana is smoking on Alzheimer's.

115
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:07,980
Separately for men and women. No.

116
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:18,820
Why? Because if Alzheimer's, if if marijuana smoking is causing or preventing Alzheimer's, more women than men.

117
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:25,660
Well, maybe it will be worth focusing on interventions that are targeted to women.

118
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:30,130
Right. They may be more cost effective and may save more lives.

119
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:39,040
Okay. So this is how we could label the causal question.

120
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:44,120
Is the cause and effect of marijuana smoking in Alzheimer's, the same in women and men.

121
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:54,870
To do that, we can quantify the effect separately between men and women through the process of stratification,

122
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:58,650
which consists of estimating the effect of iron,

123
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:07,900
weight or each category level of or stratum of a third variable that we are going to call arbitrarily m.

124
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:23,710
Okay. So I brought you the data here back and now we have an additional variable which distinguishes men from women.

125
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:27,380
So it's coded one if it's a woman and zero if it's a man.

126
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:33,350
And we are going to estimate first the effect on women only.

127
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:43,940
So to do that, we have to identify what the women in this study and I did that by enclosing the women in this sort of box.

128
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:50,030
So the people or the dogs who are enclosed in this box represent.

129
00:17:51,020 --> 00:18:00,220
Women because M takes the value of what? So these people need to be the new denominators.

130
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:10,700
For our estimation of cumulative incidence. So among the exposed, we have five women.

131
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:18,630
M equals one word exposed. Right. So this is the notation of the condition.

132
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:28,680
And of them three had the outcome. So they can see in that group is three divided by five in 30 years.

133
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:38,010
And among the unexposed women who are unexposed, we have one in five years in one out of five in 30 years.

134
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,580
We could estimate the measures of association.

135
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:53,800
In that subset as the military difference in women or for.

136
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:59,470
What ratio? Three. Three divided by one.

137
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:09,830
Now. What now? I guess this also begs the question, can this association have a causal interpretation?

138
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:13,700
Because we are in the context of an ideal randomized trial.

139
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,940
And the answer to this question is, well,

140
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:25,909
if the exposure was assigned randomly and not conditional on that variable we are stratifying by that series.

141
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:33,150
Yes. The Association still has a costly interpretation within levels of the stratifying.

142
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:42,660
But again, only obviously in the context of an ideal randomized trial and only randomization has been done blindly to that.

143
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:52,690
Third? Very. So he did not take sex at birth into the process of randomization.

144
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:56,260
So it's okay. He does have a causal interpretation.

145
00:19:57,350 --> 00:20:05,810
What is the situation in Maine? Well, I guess the other five people are men and they have enclosed them here in.

146
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:16,740
In a box and. We can estimate the community of incidents among the exposed men,

147
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:28,140
which would be two divided by five and among the ethnic the unexposed men would be these two divided by five in 30 years.

148
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:36,750
Estimate our measures of association. And we find that the difference is zero and in between sins ratio is one.

149
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:46,290
So is there an association in men? I'm asking.

150
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:52,410
No. There is no association in men. Is there an association in women?

151
00:20:53,100 --> 00:21:03,010
Yes, there was. So we can compare the stratum specific estimates of association.

152
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:09,850
In the absolute scale, they are different.

153
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:15,410
Because here is point for showing a positive association.

154
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:19,520
Here is zero showing no association in the multiplicative scale.

155
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:24,409
They are also different. This is showing a positive association.

156
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:25,820
This is one showing no association.

157
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:37,930
So because the stratum specific measures of association differ, we can say that sex modifies the effect of marijuana smoking on Alzheimer's disease.

158
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:47,040
Recall, you should compare the stratum specific measures with each other.

159
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:57,840
Of interest. And I guess importantly, you may note, actually numerically each of these.

160
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:10,730
To. Estimates. Are going to surround the overall estimate numerically.

161
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:15,850
So in other words, the overall estimate should be somewhere in between.

162
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:25,989
This is. In in the corresponding skit, you remember, what was the estimate?

163
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:29,170
Or maybe you can go back at the legs up now.

164
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:34,690
Okay. What was the estimate for the overall estimate for the cumulative incidence difference?

165
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:42,690
Thing is, it should be like the fourth slide or something. Legacy like 2.7.7.

166
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,200
Point two. So point two is in between point four and zero, right?

167
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:53,930
Okay. And what was the estimate for the insurance ratio overall?

168
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:59,430
1.7. So on point seven is in between one and three.

169
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:11,290
So a bit of a formal definition here instead of a modifies the effect of a on y

170
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:20,080
when the average causal effect of a unlike varies across levels or strata of m.

171
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:28,290
99 idea randomized experiment. We can assume exchange ability in every stratum of the population.

172
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:37,080
In observational studies, we need the same stronger assumptions as for estimating overall effects.

173
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:44,470
All right. Now.

174
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:51,230
When you have effect modification. The effect of a on white.

175
00:23:53,570 --> 00:24:07,380
May very. In every attribute of the association we know of between levels of that third line and recall, the attributes could be.

176
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:12,350
The direction, the strength and even the precision.

177
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:17,960
Right. Meaning. You may have.

178
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:22,870
Effect modification in which in one stratum.

179
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:26,580
There is still an association.

180
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:36,980
In the order there is no association or in the order the association may be in the opposite direction as it is in the first set,

181
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:45,920
or you may have effect modification in which you have the association in the same direction in both strata but of different magnitude.

182
00:24:47,280 --> 00:25:01,170
Yes. Question. Well, your evaluation of effect modification should depend on prior knowledge.

183
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:08,270
Yes. But as as I mentioned before, actually.

184
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:15,760
The presence of a fake modification depends on the scale in which you evaluated.

185
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:25,280
Meaning you may get different answers when you evaluate it in the additive scale and when you evaluate it in the multiplicative scale.

186
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:31,880
Because of that, in your readings, you may have found that they call effect modification,

187
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,399
effect, measure modification, because it depends on the measure you use.

188
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:46,920
It depends on the scale. I'm sorry.

189
00:25:55,900 --> 00:26:02,680
I guess you know this, but, you know, it's sort of if you use cumulative incidence differences,

190
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:06,940
incidence rate differences, you are in the additive scale.

191
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:16,390
If you use the ratio, you are in a multiplicative escape. Now, let's let's go through some numerical examples of of effect modification.

192
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:23,050
This first one is this study of physical activity and diabetes.

193
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:35,800
You can assume is perhaps a close cohort study. So the exposure is being physically inactive and the outcome is developing diabetes, risk of diabetes.

194
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:48,370
So this is what the data look like. We have here the exposed a total of 1946 exposed people and 20 to 47 unexposed people.

195
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:53,020
And we have here the outcomes in each group.

196
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:58,370
The number of people who develop diabetes in each exposure record.

197
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:06,720
So we can estimate the risk in 20 years by dividing this number on the total at risk at baseline.

198
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:11,100
This is eight in the exposed and 2.7 in the unexposed.

199
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:18,670
The cumulative incidence difference in 20 years is the difference between these two numbers,

200
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:23,260
5.3, and the ratio is the ratio of these two numbers, which is exactly three.

201
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:38,420
Now. Let's say, because of. Paton-Walsh, investigators suspect that this association may be modified by whether people have a gene variant or not.

202
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:42,470
So they send samples to the lab and get.

203
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:50,840
Results on whether or not people have got variant on a gene, let's say is a dichotomous variable.

204
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:54,679
Either people have the variant or not. So we have a new variable.

205
00:27:54,680 --> 00:28:00,320
And she said that it is gene and only two levels, zero or one.

206
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:11,480
And now we are going to stratify this association by whether people don't have the variant or have the back of the gene.

207
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,600
Right. You ready? Okay, so here it is.

208
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:22,190
This is what the data look like among people in whom the gene is absent and equals zero.

209
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:26,090
And this is the data among people in whom the gene is present and equals one.

210
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:35,600
So you can repeat. The same procedure is the major measures of frequency and association for each of these.

211
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:42,730
Rather separately. And we have that. In people with the gene.

212
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:47,760
Absent the cumulative cumulative incidence difference, additive scale is four.

213
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:54,300
In people with the gene present it is ten. So is there a modification?

214
00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:03,090
Oh, you bet. Yeah. In the editing escape, we are comparing this terms specific estimates and they differ estimates of association.

215
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:07,360
But then when you estimate the quantity and sales ratio,

216
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:14,680
it is three among people without the gene and it also it is also three among people with it is the traffic modification.

217
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:20,180
No. There is no effect modification on the multiplicative escape.

218
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:30,510
Interesting. All right.

219
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:33,590
This is a second example of alcohol intake.

220
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:38,030
The exposure, let's say high alcohol intake and dementia.

221
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:49,630
The outcome way it's a an open cohort we have here the person time contributed by people exposed or unexposed.

222
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:53,750
And we have the number of events of dementia in each group.

223
00:29:54,590 --> 00:30:02,239
We can estimate incidence rates per 1000 person years by dividing this number on the person years.

224
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,600
In each cohort we have 19.9 and 12.6.

225
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:12,980
The incidence rate different is 7.4 and the incidence rate ratio is 1.6.

226
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:28,380
Again, there is suspicion that one gene that codes for lipoproteins could modify.

227
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:33,810
This association. It's called an apology or F login.

228
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:43,370
So investigators and samples get people genotyped and some of them have the variants and others don't.

229
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:48,530
So we have stratified the results here by that.

230
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:53,440
Variant. These are people without the Varian.

231
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,310
These are people with the Varian and these are the numbers in each group.

232
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:05,500
If you estimate your measures again, you get that your incidence rate difference in people without the variant is 7.5,

233
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:12,430
whereas in people we divide, it is also 7.5. That effect measure modification on the additive is scale.

234
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:15,610
No. Because these numbers are the same.

235
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:23,200
But when you estimate the incidence rate ratios and the multiplicative scale, they differ is 1.3 and this is 3.2.

236
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:28,330
So there is effect modification in the multiplicative scale only.

237
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:42,930
Again, as we said before, note that this overall ratio is in between the stratum specific estimates numeric.

238
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:53,490
And one other example, maternal obesity.

239
00:31:53,730 --> 00:32:01,260
This is the exposure and C-section. So, you know, it's a close cohort.

240
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:05,010
We have 3000 exposed women.

241
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:11,680
Be delivered through a C section and there's 6300 women.

242
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:19,300
Being delivered through other means. And this is.

243
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:30,489
The birth prevalence of. C section in each group and use the footnotes in perinatal epidemiology.

244
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:36,280
Many of the outcomes that are evaluated at birth are called prevalence by convention,

245
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:43,180
even though you can think of them really as incident outcomes because they are the result of pregnancy.

246
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,709
You know it. Nine Related Process by convention.

247
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:51,760
What happens at birth is typically called birth prevalence.

248
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:57,760
Okay, so being born by a C-section or not is called the birth prevalence of C-section.

249
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:05,990
And there is a positive association there. The prevalence difference explained for the prevalence ratio is 2.5.

250
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:13,310
Now, you know, investigators say, well, actually, babies.

251
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:24,290
One common reason why but women end up having a C-section is because the baby's grown too big.

252
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:30,590
And there is one biological viable that might have to do with the size of the baby.

253
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:33,710
So, like, they, you know, the.

254
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:43,020
The sex of the baby. Because baby, baby boys tend to be a little bit larger than that baby girl.

255
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:52,390
So. So, you know, it's it's of interest to see whether this association differs, according to whether the mom is carrying a baby boy or baby girl.

256
00:33:54,130 --> 00:34:01,390
So the stratifying variable is is the the sex of the fetus in this case is female features.

257
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:06,100
So equal zero is female fetus equals one is male fetus.

258
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:09,680
And this is the stratified numbers.

259
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:18,830
And when you estimate your stratum, a specific prevalence differences or ratios, there is actually no difference whatsoever between them.

260
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:24,000
So is the effect modification here? No, in either case.

261
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:28,980
Okay. Yes, Vincent.

262
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:32,110
Right. So what's the numbers are like?

263
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:36,820
Like they're. You know, it's very.

264
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:49,390
Great. So the question is, what if the numbers are only slightly different and what sort of the you know,

265
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:53,020
you're your threshold to decide whether they are different or not.

266
00:34:55,430 --> 00:34:59,690
Strictly speaking, you will need to estimate measures of precision.

267
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:07,380
Um, which we only cover toward the end of the course and more or less in passing.

268
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:14,330
So for the sake of this particular. Stage of training.

269
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:21,650
Let's say that any difference, you know, is is going to be or should be.

270
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:29,880
Decided this. Being a fake modification.

271
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:35,870
At Technical, you need to make extra calculations of precision.

272
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:43,800
To see, depending on a number of assumptions, whether the numbers are truly different or not.

273
00:35:53,670 --> 00:36:01,620
Overall. Can you hold on for just 20 minutes?

274
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:06,840
And I might get back to you, though, but I hope that's okay.

275
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:12,630
Okay, great. Thank you. Great question. All right.

276
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:20,820
A few summary issues here. So effect modification may exist in both the additive and multiplicative scale.

277
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:30,940
It may exist in the multiplicative scale only. It may exist in the additive scale only or none of them, and there is no effect modification.

278
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:35,350
And it's kind of silly, but we know.

279
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:43,070
We could. Also classified that type of effect modification,

280
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:54,050
depending on whether it affects only the magnitude or the strength of the association or whether it also affects the direction of the association.

281
00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:59,160
And according to that, it can be classified as quantitative or quality.

282
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:11,510
Quantitative effect modification is that in which the direction of dissociation in both strata is the same as it is overall,

283
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:15,260
but differs only in magnitude for a string.

284
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:25,209
That's quantitative and qualitative effect modification is when the direction

285
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:32,020
of the association between the strata changes with respect to the overall.

286
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:42,180
So you may have an overall association that's it's a positive, but then when you stratify,

287
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:50,040
you'll find that in one stratum is positive and in the other is inverse or in one is positive and in the other is null.

288
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:58,480
So if the direction of the association changes between strata, you have a qualitative effect modification.

289
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:03,600
Okay. And there are some real life examples.

290
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:08,850
I think these are from your readings that that are, you know, very informative and interesting.

291
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:17,580
For example, quality caffeine intake in women is positively associated with delayed conception.

292
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:23,610
Among nonsmokers, but inversely among smokers.

293
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:38,250
Now. Why you're what does that mean? Well, you need to be, I guess, a nutritional and reproductive epidemiologist to know that they don't know.

294
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:46,970
Um. But finding this is very could be very informative of specific mechanisms.

295
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:53,570
So biologically there might be something that caffeine does with um.

296
00:38:55,870 --> 00:39:00,840
Smoking. Uh. You know that.

297
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:10,680
Make this up. Paternal age is related to schizophrenia, but only in people without family history.

298
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:20,280
So in people with family history, there is no association between paternal schizophrenia and people without family history.

299
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:24,660
There is a it is an association. What could this mean?

300
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:30,070
I think these guys hit the jackpot here because it was published in the BMJ.

301
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:47,290
There's a bigger. So these finding may the investigators hypothesize that perhaps it was their novel mutations

302
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:54,340
related with their knowledge that were involved in the theology of schizophrenia.

303
00:39:54,610 --> 00:40:01,010
That was a big, big, big. A leap forward in psychiatric immunity.

304
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:07,130
Yes. Out of, you know. Stratification effect modification.

305
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:16,650
And then alcohol intake is related to oral cancer in women, but only among those with lung falling into the nutrition majors.

306
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:27,710
Your line up to explain this. I do think this was the case or this could be the case.

307
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:36,630
So in one stratum. Among women with low folate intake.

308
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:44,790
Alcohol intake could cause oral cancer in women with normal or high alcohol following intake.

309
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:52,560
Alcohol, that's nothing to oral cancer. What do you know about folate metabolism?

310
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:14,470
Well, that's one option. Yeah. Is there another possibility?

311
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:23,140
I mean. Yes.

312
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:29,320
Excellent, Emily. Alcohol intake can increase.

313
00:41:30,770 --> 00:41:34,820
The needs, the requirements of following another.

314
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:43,480
Good. All right. No.

315
00:41:44,290 --> 00:41:50,200
There are a couple of, you know, sort of mathematical issues here with this qualitative effect ification.

316
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:55,060
It is always present in both the additive and the multiplicative escape.

317
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:12,610
Now we are done with certification. We are moving into evaluating if a modification by.

318
00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:19,620
Estimating. Observed versus expected joint effects and combining.

319
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:29,160
And to begin that I have a rhetorical question here for you can and effect modifier be itself a cause of the outcome.

320
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:40,120
Yes. The answer is yes. So if A and M are each causes of Y effect modification.

321
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:45,210
Can be also called a statistical interaction.

322
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:55,120
So you have statistical interaction with the combined effect of two or more exposures,

323
00:42:55,130 --> 00:43:04,340
let's say an M is different from what would be expected from the combination of the two separate effects, assuming that they are independent.

324
00:43:08,350 --> 00:43:14,020
So in other words, the observed joint effect of an end differs from the expected joint effect.

325
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:24,920
When the observed effect is equal to the expected effect.

326
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:36,380
Assuming they are independent, there is no interaction. When they differ, there is interaction and depending on the way they differ.

327
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:46,320
The interaction has a different name. If the observed effect is greater than the expected, there is positive interaction or synergism.

328
00:43:47,070 --> 00:43:52,550
If the observed effect is less than the expected, there is negative interaction or antagonism.

329
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:58,059
Let let's do an example to to see how can this be worked out.

330
00:43:58,060 --> 00:44:16,270
So. We have, again, that study of physical inactivity, and that is and we had another variable, which is a cause of diabetes as well, diabetes gene.

331
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:22,240
You recall we had stratified the overall association between those two levels.

332
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:38,670
Let's estimate the observed. Cumulative incidence difference for each course in the absence of the other.

333
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:57,090
So if you wanted to. Examine or estimate the cumulative incidence difference for a physical inactivity in the absence of.

334
00:44:58,170 --> 00:45:01,440
The gene. Why do you need to compare?

335
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:06,620
Which numbers do you need to compare. Of these cumulative incidences?

336
00:45:08,230 --> 00:45:12,140
You are interested in the effect of a in the absence of m.

337
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:26,330
You compare? These number against these number because they are both in the absence of any.

338
00:45:27,570 --> 00:45:31,110
Right. They will give you the effect of a in the absence of him.

339
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:43,260
So here is that comparison. You get 4%. That is the observed effect of a in the absence of M in the additive escape.

340
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:48,299
How about the observed effect of M?

341
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:51,870
In the absence of a, which ones do you have to compare?

342
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:56,510
Absence of a means this and this.

343
00:45:56,520 --> 00:46:02,200
Right? So you have to compare these number.

344
00:46:03,770 --> 00:46:07,280
With this number. And they.

345
00:46:08,790 --> 00:46:12,570
Observed Association is three in the Adaptive Escape.

346
00:46:13,590 --> 00:46:17,050
Is that clear? That estimating.

347
00:46:18,210 --> 00:46:26,550
The effect of one variable in the absence of the other, the absence means you have to focus on when the values of the other are zero.

348
00:46:27,450 --> 00:46:35,850
Okay. If the effects of an independent.

349
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:41,459
Then the expected joint effect is nothing but this.

350
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:44,970
Some of these two numbers, 7%.

351
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:57,430
That's the expected joint effect. The last part of the exercise is then to estimate the observed joint effect.

352
00:46:59,510 --> 00:47:02,900
How do you think we can estimate the observed joint effect?

353
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:07,230
Join means when both are present. Right?

354
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:12,760
And what should we compare that against? When both are.

355
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:18,560
Absent. Right. So it should be when both are present.

356
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:24,010
Is this 15? A one and one when both are absentees?

357
00:47:24,010 --> 00:47:28,090
What? 200.

358
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:31,870
So you compare those two numbers, you get 13%.

359
00:47:33,470 --> 00:47:40,330
I will do the expected and the observed joint effects of a name compare to each other.

360
00:47:45,490 --> 00:47:52,030
Which one is larger? The observed June effect is larger than the expected June effect.

361
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:56,440
So is there interaction between a and M?

362
00:47:57,650 --> 00:48:03,290
Yes. In what direction? They are synergistic.

363
00:48:04,290 --> 00:48:07,950
Synergistic. Meaning having them both.

364
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:16,280
That's more. Then having each one separately and what you expect.

365
00:48:18,370 --> 00:48:26,410
Okay. And you can do the same exercise but in the multiplicative escape.

366
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:33,189
So instead of estimating cumulative incidence differences here,

367
00:48:33,190 --> 00:48:42,820
I'm estimating even since ratios the only difference we in terms of calculations with abuse like is that here I'm dividing rather than subtracting.

368
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:52,840
So if I divide, I get that the. Effect of a in the absence of m is three.

369
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:58,030
The effect of M in the absence of a is 2.5.

370
00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:07,480
The expected joint effect is the problem of these two numbers is no longer the sum because we are in the multiplicative escape.

371
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:15,520
So is the problem. The problem is 7.5 and the observed joint c r is going to be.

372
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:21,400
The ratio of the.

373
00:49:24,750 --> 00:49:35,850
The group that has both a equals one and because when compared to the group that has both equal zero and zero 50 divided by two, that's 7.5.

374
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:42,320
Is there any interaction on the multiplicative risk? No, because these numbers are the same.

375
00:49:42,770 --> 00:49:45,490
There is no intention. Okay.

376
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:55,090
So a few points to summarize these if an hour each causes of like if there is no additive interaction there must be multiplicative index.

377
00:49:56,530 --> 00:50:02,950
If there is no multiplicative interaction, there must be additive interaction if there is no interaction in either scale.

378
00:50:03,130 --> 00:50:06,340
Turns out at least one of the variables is not associated with the.

379
00:50:08,730 --> 00:50:18,440
Okay. Now with the interaction, I guess, and a family ification, there is this concept of reciprocity,

380
00:50:18,830 --> 00:50:32,600
which is that interaction is always reciprocal in that if end modifies association between and way A has to modify the association between M and what.

381
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:46,260
How do you decide which one is the. Modifier, which one modifies the association of the other.

382
00:50:46,290 --> 00:50:52,320
Well, um, I guess that again and in your readings there are some suggestions.

383
00:50:52,710 --> 00:50:58,350
One is to, to pick as the modifier the variable that is not amenable to intervention.

384
00:50:58,950 --> 00:51:03,750
For example, in studies in visual modifier, you said, Jean, you know,

385
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:12,149
that could probably be considered the actual modify it rather than the environmental variable that you restate because they.

386
00:51:12,150 --> 00:51:19,330
Jean, you cannot do anything about. But you can act on the environmental record like, say, physical inactivity.

387
00:51:19,630 --> 00:51:27,980
Right. And when it's amenable to intervention, you know, both of them,

388
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:33,710
maybe you can pick the variable that already has a known effect on the outcome as they modify it,

389
00:51:34,730 --> 00:51:40,610
because that might allow you to contribute to explaining that known effect.

390
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:48,200
There are a few words on all interpretations of statistical interaction.

391
00:51:48,220 --> 00:51:55,960
Again, it is probably more for what your general culture as epidemiologists, but some others like Rothman, which you probably read,

392
00:51:56,740 --> 00:52:03,129
equate the presence of interaction in the additive scale with causal interaction or biological interaction.

393
00:52:03,130 --> 00:52:06,250
In other words, they think that if there is.

394
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:11,110
Statistical interaction between two variables.

395
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:21,190
There must be something biologically happening between the two variables at some molecular or cellular level that's actually creating them.

396
00:52:22,270 --> 00:52:28,839
But. You know, I guess in in real life and some other view is that, again,

397
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:34,150
causation requires obviously more assumptions, particularly in observational studies.

398
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:44,020
And an interaction between two variables may not necessarily represent that biological molecular interaction.

399
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:48,150
Right. Now.

400
00:52:52,120 --> 00:53:00,480
Yes. We are getting close to your family. Lindsay, we are getting close to Lindsay's excellent question.

401
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:05,700
How? Because many methods are based on the multiplicative scale.

402
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:10,590
And I think we talked about these there were historical reasons. Right.

403
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:18,770
Additive interactions are not conventionally examined or reported, mostly multiplicative.

404
00:53:21,690 --> 00:53:27,450
But additive interactions may still be relevant from a public health perspective because

405
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:35,609
interventions in subsets might result in larger decreases of absolute disease numbers.

406
00:53:35,610 --> 00:53:39,820
And again, when we are in the. Maybe saving business.

407
00:53:40,850 --> 00:53:44,840
This is important. We want to save as many babies as we can.

408
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:50,320
Right. Here is the the example on physical activity.

409
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:55,540
And you recall there was no multiplicative interaction, right?

410
00:53:56,140 --> 00:54:02,140
The observed and expected joint effects were both 7.5 in the typical risk.

411
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:09,040
But in the additive scale there was an interaction in one among people.

412
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:14,200
Without the gene, the effect was 4%. Among people with the gene, the effect was 10%.

413
00:54:14,590 --> 00:54:17,950
So if the prevalence of exposure with the gene is high in the population,

414
00:54:18,430 --> 00:54:27,880
increasing physical activity being an intervention in those with the gene might prevent in fact more cases than trying to increase it on everyone.

415
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:32,230
And guess what? Maybe cheaper. Right.

416
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:44,320
So in this case, it's important to still consider the additive scape and then the nail in the coffin is coming commonly.

417
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:54,170
There might even exist synergism in the additive scale with antagonism in the multiplicative scale.

418
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:59,000
And I brought you a numerical example of that. Yes, I know it's mind blowing.

419
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:04,370
So it is one vertical example. Turns out that.

420
00:55:06,140 --> 00:55:13,700
You know, the difference in people without the gene is 30% and people with the gene is 60%.

421
00:55:14,030 --> 00:55:23,410
So that is synergism that by the cumulative incidence rate multiplicative in scale people without the gene is four and people with the gene is 2.5.

422
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:28,460
So these antagonism then what do you do by convention?

423
00:55:28,730 --> 00:55:37,460
And sorry, these may be anti-climatic, but by convention the additive interaction prevents.

424
00:55:38,850 --> 00:55:46,380
So you may be wondering why people don't report it in in you know, in their research, I guess.

425
00:55:46,650 --> 00:55:52,410
But because. They? Yeah, maybe.

426
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:59,840
NON-reporting researchers. But that, you know, if you.

427
00:56:01,340 --> 00:56:06,799
I have I have never reported the interactions in the Addictiveness game,

428
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:18,890
but after teaching these and especially the advanced technology methods cause for three years or so in which we were going into this,

429
00:56:18,890 --> 00:56:26,450
I became sort of a convert myself and I'm working on a paper right now where I'm presenting results in the in the additive.

430
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:34,850
Luckily, they are the same. There is no interaction, which is actually a good thing for for that particular question.

431
00:56:36,170 --> 00:56:41,450
All right. Uh. What to do with the effect modification.

432
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:48,420
Unless they said a family ification is an intrinsic phenomenon, is not a bias, is not an act.

433
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:56,550
So as such, you know, it's not something you can try to eliminate through study design or or manipulation of data.

434
00:56:56,570 --> 00:57:05,070
No, it's just what there is. So if you observe effect modification, you should report it and should interpret it.

435
00:57:05,580 --> 00:57:10,410
And the usual way to do so is by presenting stratum specific.

436
00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:19,660
And I guess that's the logical. As Pacheco was saying.

437
00:57:22,530 --> 00:57:34,950
Well, suggesting, you know, if if you suspect a fake modification, you should plan it in advance based on your close and knowledge search.

438
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:42,300
Because in any study. In a new study of one specific exposure with one specific outcome,

439
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:51,450
you bet you are going to have at the tip of your fingerprints many, many other variables.

440
00:57:51,990 --> 00:58:01,410
And it can be very tempting. Let's say you happened not to find an overall association can be very tempting to say, hmm,

441
00:58:01,770 --> 00:58:06,870
well, let's look at the association by strata of these and this and this and this and this.

442
00:58:07,590 --> 00:58:10,130
That is a very, very bad practice.

443
00:58:11,810 --> 00:58:22,430
So you should have thought in advance what variables might be modifiers and might be worth looking into as modifiers,

444
00:58:22,610 --> 00:58:28,760
rather than just trying everything without any a priori hypothesis that that's bad religion.

445
00:58:30,170 --> 00:58:36,710
Yes. Yes.

446
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:49,290
Why is it? Well, I guess the convention is based on the fact that, you know, in public health,

447
00:58:49,290 --> 00:58:54,360
we are really always interested in in counts and even in clinical practice as well.

448
00:58:55,040 --> 00:59:06,850
We really want to save people. Yeah.

449
00:59:10,710 --> 00:59:15,510
Okay. A few caveats on on effect modification.

450
00:59:16,940 --> 00:59:24,870
The presence of effect modification may affect the generalizability of your estimates of association.

451
00:59:24,890 --> 00:59:29,180
In other words, the transport abilities. In other words,

452
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:40,400
your ability to say this overall estimate of association can apply in my population as well as it can apply in populations B, C, and D.

453
00:59:40,580 --> 00:59:45,920
You may not be able to do that if there is effect modification in your population weight,

454
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:52,250
because if the prevalence of the effect modifiers in the other populations is different from that in yours,

455
00:59:53,330 --> 00:59:58,520
then that overall estimate will also be different in those populations.

456
00:59:59,210 --> 01:00:04,990
Okay. Now we will have another session on this.

457
01:00:04,990 --> 01:00:16,330
But, you know, I guess for now you can say that this lack of general generalizability, this inability to transport your estimated populations.

458
01:00:17,530 --> 01:00:27,219
Is is is called or is a show of lack of external validity, meaning your results may be valid for your population.

459
01:00:27,220 --> 01:00:30,940
If you conducted your study properly, they may not apply to other populations.

460
01:00:30,940 --> 01:00:40,740
That's called external volume. Okay. Now, another caveat with a fake modification is that it cannot be easily represented.

461
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:50,700
We remember in the taxation how among the limitations of the tax, it said it cannot easily represent a fake modification.

462
01:00:50,700 --> 01:00:53,820
And they tell you, well, you don't have to worry about that because you don't.

463
01:00:54,090 --> 01:00:57,260
But when we go through a fake movie occasion, I'll tell you how.

464
01:00:57,540 --> 01:01:05,550
Remember that. So here is my cut. Remember that this is a fake verification that is not straightforward to represent with that.

465
01:01:06,420 --> 01:01:13,710
Now, the way in which it is represented with that and again, this is sort of your wedding night kind of advice,

466
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:21,960
especially if you are going into advance that there is no other way to represent fake interaction than this.

467
01:01:23,190 --> 01:01:26,190
Do you all see this? Because I know it's a little bit low on the screen.

468
01:01:26,250 --> 01:01:31,320
Do you see this, these that as the only way to represent a fake modification.

469
01:01:32,340 --> 01:01:38,650
So this that is saying. Both a and m causes of why.

470
01:01:39,790 --> 01:01:49,340
And that implies. Interaction that implies that the observed joint effect of an m.

471
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:55,380
Is different from the. Expected join.

472
01:01:58,810 --> 01:02:04,030
But again, this representation is somewhat unspecific of effect modification.

473
01:02:04,900 --> 01:02:12,880
I don't really why I say this because you may see something that some like some people.

474
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:17,620
I don't know how or from where. I don't know. But.

475
01:02:18,550 --> 01:02:25,930
They have decided even sometimes to teach that the way to represent a fake modification in attack is

476
01:02:25,930 --> 01:02:36,640
to raise an arrow head from a variable into another arrow into the middle of another arrow that's.

477
01:02:38,310 --> 01:02:42,180
Not that notation. That's not that.

478
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:48,850
That's. Back. There's wrong. You cannot have arrows pointing to arrows.

479
01:02:49,450 --> 01:02:53,450
You know that. Never. Nearly.

480
01:02:55,710 --> 01:02:58,710
Arrows can only connect variables or not. Okay.

481
01:02:59,430 --> 01:03:06,120
So if you see that, yeah, you can maybe smile, but don't don't learn it.

482
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:11,620
And you might see them. Okay.

483
01:03:13,150 --> 01:03:19,850
Do you have any questions on this? If a modification direction.

484
01:03:20,890 --> 01:03:23,960
No. Okay.

485
01:03:25,010 --> 01:03:33,120
So this was. So what if you have not dichotomous variables?

486
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:41,850
Well, that's all right. The key to identify effect modification is to stratify again in practice.

487
01:03:42,540 --> 01:03:47,690
So this is a study actually from my own little dissertation.

488
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:53,290
I guess you can. Guys my age from the publication date.

489
01:03:55,330 --> 01:03:59,050
So and my study was on.

490
01:04:00,710 --> 01:04:06,740
The effect was the question at the time was whether vitamin D supplementation,

491
01:04:07,730 --> 01:04:16,250
which is an intervention that's very popular among governments and NGOs and agencies because it's cheap and,

492
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:20,490
you know, it's and, you know, can do things.

493
01:04:20,510 --> 01:04:24,680
I guess the question is, does vitamin A supplementation?

494
01:04:26,350 --> 01:04:32,920
Improve. Growth in children like linear growth, meaning growth in height.

495
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:37,190
So the studies were all over the place.

496
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:39,440
Some said yes. Some said no.

497
01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:51,950
So, you know, going through the course and knowledge, I guess the idea was, well, you know, the general population of kids is pretty heterogeneous.

498
01:04:51,950 --> 01:04:52,340
Right.

499
01:04:52,700 --> 01:05:03,710
So maybe like dominate your, you know, many other intervention in school could have an effect on subsets of kids who may actually need vitamin A.

500
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:13,970
And at the time I was working in Africa. And one of the big scourges still is HIV infection and be the education of infection.

501
01:05:13,970 --> 01:05:19,190
That is just a total tragedy. So one of the questions was, well,

502
01:05:19,190 --> 01:05:28,040
we had a general cohort that know random randomized trial and some of the kids were infected with HIV and some others were not.

503
01:05:28,700 --> 01:05:37,910
And what we wondered is what may be why dominate vitamin A didn't work overall in the in that trial on growth.

504
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:46,880
But the question was, might it work in subsets of kids who actually needed like those with infections.

505
01:05:47,870 --> 01:05:56,210
So we stratified our analysis of the effect of vitamin A on growth, and this is the result.

506
01:05:57,510 --> 01:06:02,040
Among kids without HIV infection, there is no effect whatsoever.

507
01:06:02,070 --> 01:06:06,480
These are growth curves, right? We're not really concerned.

508
01:06:08,550 --> 01:06:14,459
And the darker line is the growth graph of kids who were assigned to vitamin A supplements.

509
01:06:14,460 --> 01:06:17,880
The lighter line is for kids who are assigned to placebo.

510
01:06:18,420 --> 01:06:22,500
And as you see, the two lines are parallel, meaning no effect whatsoever.

511
01:06:23,630 --> 01:06:29,450
Because this is the height of our time. But hey, look in HIV positive kids.

512
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:40,090
Those who get placebo are still more or less at the same level, then these actually lower because HIV affects growth, stunted growth.

513
01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:44,170
But in those who got vitamin D, guess what?

514
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:52,460
They experienced something called catch up growth. Which is that the growth graph was pulled up more or less at the level of.

515
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:57,500
Their kids were HIV negative. So.

516
01:06:58,840 --> 01:07:02,740
So that's effect modification by HIV infection.

517
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:09,930
And again, it's not that they got the most outcome because it's a logical longitudinal outcome.

518
01:07:10,450 --> 01:07:14,730
That all you have to do is to stratify. All right.

519
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:19,890
Summary effect modification is also called heterogeneity.

520
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:26,400
They say that of causal effects of a across threat of m it is evaluated through stratification.

521
01:07:28,570 --> 01:07:35,770
Interaction is also synonym interaction when both A&M are known causes is evaluated through comparison of.

522
01:07:36,660 --> 01:07:43,680
Observers expect a June effect, but algebraically is equivalent to certification, so we use them interchangeably.

523
01:07:45,860 --> 01:07:49,670
Recall. Very important effect modifications scaled up in.

524
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:59,320
As it's called, fake ification. You may have it in a multiplicative van or the additive is scaled vice versa or in no way depends on the scale.

525
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:05,080
All right. No questions. Any questions? Comments.

526
01:08:07,470 --> 01:08:10,550
Oh, yes. Here is your progress report.

527
01:08:11,030 --> 01:08:18,590
You should be able to define effect modification. Evaluate effect modification on a dichotomous outcome using stratification.

528
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:23,660
Define qualitative, quantitative and qualitative affect modification.

529
01:08:24,530 --> 01:08:27,560
Let's let's. Quantitative effect modification.

530
01:08:31,290 --> 01:08:40,770
You learn? Yes.

531
01:08:41,370 --> 01:08:50,160
When did the election of the association between strata is the same but of different magnitude about qualitative effect modification.

532
01:08:53,210 --> 01:09:02,000
Immigration changes. Okay. You should be able to evaluate statistical interaction by comparing expected words,

533
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:07,280
observe joint effects, and you will have plenty of practice for that at the next lab.

534
01:09:09,220 --> 01:09:12,340
Define reciprocity of interactions with reciprocity.

535
01:09:18,140 --> 01:09:22,370
If he fame modifies the effect of him on weight and modifies the effect of.

536
01:09:23,150 --> 01:09:29,450
Right. Discuss implications of interactions in additive versus multiplicative escapes.

537
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:33,560
They may give you the opposite answer, but the additive scale prevents.

538
01:09:36,970 --> 01:09:42,640
And finally recognize effect modification as an intrinsic phenomenon, not a bias.

539
01:09:45,820 --> 01:09:51,580
Okay. If no questions have come up since I last asked then.

540
01:09:52,570 --> 01:09:55,840
Have a good weekend. Okay. See you Monday.

541
01:10:08,710 --> 01:10:24,340
Oh. Is.

542
01:10:52,870 --> 01:11:14,530
Yeah. Yeah.

543
01:12:01,550 --> 01:12:19,970
You know. On.
