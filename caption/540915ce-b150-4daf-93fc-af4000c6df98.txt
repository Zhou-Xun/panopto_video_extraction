1
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:14,030
Good morning, everyone. He's they.

2
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,340
Okay. So I will talk about this practice today.

3
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,590
I mean. I'm just wondering if I should.

4
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,280
Wait at least maybe the second half.

5
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:40,440
Before that there. Media did that.

6
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:48,280
So. And you get these questions for me.

7
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:05,799
Any. Any questions for me? Get to the homework.

8
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:10,660
If you noticed that we extended the deadline for you on the script.

9
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:20,690
Because neither of the sections they've to be sample in modulate.

10
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:28,010
So that's what you. And then we little going more the movie and I'm talking about interactions.

11
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:32,590
Okay. So no questions.

12
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:50,300
Okay. So. Let's sort of pick up from where we left on Thursday.

13
00:01:50,810 --> 00:02:02,720
And we were you know, we talked about categories and poor areas and we talked about the different coding schemes,

14
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:09,320
the different CEL coding and the cell means coding.

15
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:21,530
And then we also talked about scoring of categorical covariate, especially if it's an ordinal categorical variable, then you know,

16
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:30,650
how does the standard model that you get for the job assigns, holds and analyzing, you didn't want to look for median,

17
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:41,780
but we also sort of talked about the limitation of this approach and the bottom naught 7% growth in the sense that, you know,

18
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:57,100
like it, you know, the story sort of assumes that the categories are equally spaced and they is some inherent ordinal.

19
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:08,450
So oftentimes that may not hold. And so we argued about sort of the implication of this point on the categories and

20
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:15,810
how does that reflect on the hypothesis that says that the best of the sequential?

21
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:30,140
So and you have an example like that that we saw the homework when we ask you to kind of do it yourself type of exercise for me to convince you that,

22
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:36,740
you know, like the values of this course, you know, in fact the best statistics and so on.

23
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:43,400
So with that, that's, that's where we kind of stop.

24
00:03:44,120 --> 00:04:00,340
And we all we also talked about testing the association between a categorical variable and outcome using either like,

25
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:11,089
you know, sort of like a reference coding model versus score based model.

26
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:20,360
And we talked about like the pros and cons of both approaches like testing with the continuous with for example,

27
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:27,910
you were looking at SBP versus aid and we've talked about like IDs getting the model over time to move forward versus

28
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:38,000
even giving it to the model of the categorical covariate and the pros and cons of of those two approaches like so.

29
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:49,220
So that's where we start. And today we are going to talk about we are going to talk about this specific example.

30
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:56,209
So we had just introduced that example.

31
00:04:56,210 --> 00:05:13,010
So I'm going to start from here. So this is an example of a data that was assembled and this consisted of life

32
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:17,240
expectancy calculations as well as other population and demographic data.

33
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:27,620
And we have looked at each row in the dataset pertains to a certain country, so country.

34
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:32,840
So this is a categorical variable and it's a nominal, categorical, valuable.

35
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:42,079
And the primary objective is to determine the role of the following descriptor says Predictors of life expectancy.

36
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,489
So we have continent actually, not country.

37
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:51,049
We have continent again, a nominal categorical variable.

38
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:56,750
We have gender, we have persons for television and persons or medical doctors.

39
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:04,880
So these are the call periods and then our outcome is life expectancy.

40
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:19,250
Okay? So here is sort of a, you know, kind of feudal from that dataset.

41
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:36,890
And what we are going to do is we are going to sort of illustrate the various concepts we learn in modulate pertaining to categorical morbidity.

42
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:41,720
And we are also going to we are going to look at continent.

43
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:49,420
As the only go with it. And then we are going to also bring in part TV person for television persons for medical doctors.

44
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:56,940
These remember are one below us already it's so we will introduce that excuse me type voices book.

45
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:05,100
We will introduce them and sort of analyze this in the spirit of the analysis of obedience.

46
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:13,419
What we to recall the analysis of what we use model has basically a factor,

47
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:20,860
variable factor meaning like a categorical variable with a certain number of levels.

48
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,389
This is all to refer to the fact that the human and then we also have to have something less for the other.

49
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:35,290
And just assuming that that that body this we had talked about the analysis of obedience model.

50
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:40,630
And so we will bring in those information as well.

51
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:48,130
So first, we produce some frequency tables for the quantity then.

52
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:55,450
So we have, you know, Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, South America.

53
00:07:55,900 --> 00:08:07,870
And we have the frequencies for or the number of records for each of these continents in the dataset.

54
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:20,050
So just some descriptive statistics, the total sample size and is 76 and here is the frequency distribution by the various continents.

55
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:26,530
So the second row are the two frequencies and the last three is the proportion.

56
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:38,160
Okay. Then we compute the mean life expectancy by continent.

57
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:41,729
So once again, really basic.

58
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:47,510
Descriptive. So.

59
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:58,600
The poor Africa. The mean life expectancy was 59.8 years for Asia.

60
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:03,610
65.3 years. Europe 74.5.

61
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:08,470
North America 74.66. And South America 69.1.

62
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:14,830
So these are all mean life expectancies for these continents.

63
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:26,860
Then what do they do? So the first thing we do is remember, continent is a nominal categorical variable.

64
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:35,240
So we actually create dummy variables in order to incorporate into the model.

65
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:44,530
So we have Mickey We had five dummy variables corresponding to Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, South America.

66
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:49,780
And the way to create this one dummy variable for indicator variables is basically,

67
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:55,750
for example, the first dummy dummy underscore if takes the value one.

68
00:09:56,020 --> 00:10:07,330
If if the continent is Africa and zero otherwise the second dummy variable dummy underscore is speaks the real one.

69
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:15,500
If the observation of the record is from East Asia and otherwise zero and so on.

70
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:26,290
So we create this five dummy variables. Now I fit the model with all the continents we presented.

71
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:31,630
And so what do I do?

72
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:36,250
I mean, this is this is sort of a proof of concept.

73
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:43,330
So I fit this model and don't look at the output yet.

74
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:48,940
But this is the model I fit. I fit y equal to beta.

75
00:10:48,950 --> 00:11:00,310
Now let me go on dummy or indicator for Africa plus beta two dummy indicated for Asia.

76
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:05,590
Let's get the dummy indicator for Europe.

77
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:18,670
Does beta for the dummy indicator or indicator for North America plus beta of five dummy really both for South America.

78
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:24,520
Plus it seems that this is the model F, so pretty linear model, all continents represented.

79
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:30,430
So here is the output from that model. Before you look at the output.

80
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:39,220
Tell me what can happen. What?

81
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:46,930
What? What's the problem with this? What are the forces that have brought them more violence again?

82
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:49,120
I think it is. What is the problem?

83
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:58,550
Maybe he sort of talked about leading in sort of gave me that answer in the context of when you were developing the the model.

84
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:06,800
But if they did go ahead and think this might be what would happen. So today.

85
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:15,420
Okay. There's no reference. Okay, but what's the problem?

86
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:22,910
Is the maximum distance. Yes.

87
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:28,900
So it's metrics of incidents. Metrics is not equal to the picture.

88
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:36,240
Oh, yeah. Okay. And there was another hand from this site deck waiting to see designed metrics.

89
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:44,110
This is designed to make existing, you know, it's complex is design make it's is less than flat.

90
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:52,060
Right because what is the design metrics for performance in the fourth column is one.

91
00:12:53,260 --> 00:13:01,210
The second column has one for the rest of the portfolio has one, three and four.

92
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:09,160
And it turns out that if you add the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth column, you would get the whole at once the column.

93
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:15,940
So basically the violence and not linearly independent.

94
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:24,930
In other words, the design matrix will be less than two then x singular, for example, that's not any more.

95
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:34,090
So there would be a problem. And lo and behold, what do we see in the output?

96
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:42,340
So in R or SAS, whatever, like AP it you know, computes the intercept.

97
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:45,430
The corporation's corresponding to dummy.

98
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:59,860
Africa. Asia. Europe. North America. But then for the dummy underscore C, the R gives the gives an N.A., N.A., N.A. any meaning like not available.

99
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:03,159
So basically it's BOM and then SAS.

100
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:10,299
What happens? SAS gives you that warning sign saying exactly that, like, you know, the extensible, this matrix is non-convertible.

101
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:18,970
So in other words, that in a means that you can all get unique solutions to the least squares equations.

102
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:25,060
Okay, so basically there's, if there's a, there's a problem.

103
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:30,880
And essentially what happens is it's telling you that, you know,

104
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:43,360
it's almost like begging you to sort of assume that the South America meet that the reference coming back to your to your point.

105
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:50,950
So so that's what is going on. And then, you know, it gives you that as it will send that into the multiple article and so on.

106
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:56,740
But that is the issue that it strives for. VIX is not in vertical or X is simply that.

107
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:07,240
Okay, so now I ask you to compute the fitted means for each continent and compare them to the means computed previously.

108
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,230
So how can a computer fitted means?

109
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:24,970
Basically, as I was saying, like it's begging you to make the South of South America as your reference group.

110
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:33,520
So now use this table that gives the point estimates for each of the coefficients.

111
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:40,330
And can you tell me? So this is like I have picked up if I meet South America.

112
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:46,360
The reference to this is basically like a different cell for me, right?

113
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:55,890
So now based on this output, who wants to tell me the fitted means or the estimated?

114
00:15:55,900 --> 00:16:01,330
My life expectancy is the estimated means for each of these continents.

115
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:09,270
So start with the reference group, start with South America.

116
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:24,030
What would be the fitted mean? What would be the estimate of life expectancy based on this model for South America?

117
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:31,200
Just to be safe again. I didn't yesterday.

118
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,100
69.1. It's based on our pact, right?

119
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:45,400
It's the intercept estimate. So for South America, it's not have it is 69.1.

120
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:59,660
What about for Africa? For now.

121
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:07,340
I think that the only dummy variable that is the value one is i.e. if everything else drops off.

122
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:15,740
So for Africa that estimate would be better not had lost between her.

123
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:24,290
Yes. So 69.1 minus ten.

124
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,270
One or one third.

125
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:36,030
59.1. What about for Asia?

126
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:43,220
It's better not had lost better to her.

127
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:51,570
So 69.1 -4.6.

128
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:57,420
Okay. So it's roughly 65.

129
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:06,740
Okay, so on. You can compute it for Europe and North America and so on.

130
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:12,810
So now can we compare these to the means that we computed previously?

131
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:19,470
So here are the from the model.

132
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:29,950
Here are the estimates from the model. I should say estimated be.

133
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:43,270
And here are the means that we had computed previously.

134
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:49,329
Just being legalistic, do statistics and can you see that they match the match?

135
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:53,830
Exactly. Which is what we would have expected.

136
00:18:55,510 --> 00:19:09,520
So great. Now I fit the model without an intercept and I want to target the parameter estimates through the grouping.

137
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:17,380
So pretty money without being passive means you're doing like a cell means for being correct.

138
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:32,810
So now I in the dummies, all the five dummy variables and the minus one indicates that.

139
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:37,920
Don't forget that kids are born in prison.

140
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:42,440
So now can you see, like, how the coefficients table changes?

141
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:50,659
I don't have an intercept. And lo and behold, what do I have for each point?

142
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:55,100
B then the coefficient corresponding to the dummies.

143
00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:00,260
Actually the estimates are the means themselves.

144
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:09,880
Which is what we saw. What savings body that the fund estimates would be equal to the.

145
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:21,960
Means so we can directly get the means from from the estimate people.

146
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:28,860
And the parameter estimates from this model are exactly what the group needs.

147
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:34,379
I mean, the simple tool for reference encoding, but for reference encoding,

148
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:41,880
you have to do one extra line of calculation to get better, not have one had better, not have better who had and so on.

149
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:47,830
You only get them directly. Everything clear?

150
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:53,310
Any questions so far? Okay.

151
00:20:53,970 --> 00:21:01,380
So now we are the SC values for the two regression models fitted did thus part.

152
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:05,060
So one is the reference and.

153
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:21,550
And the other is the 1740. So here are the cc's from these two different models.

154
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:41,450
And if you look at the ACS, if you look at the sum of squares for each of these dummy variables,

155
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:52,070
and if you look at compare them between the two regression models, the individual sums of squares are different.

156
00:21:55,590 --> 00:22:03,630
But the question is how come the SSD values are still the same?

157
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:12,360
It's somewhat squares. How? How is it that these are still the same?

158
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:18,720
Yes. To the same pot. Over to the same.

159
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:25,400
The same observation. Exactly. So what is this is see, everybody get there.

160
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:35,780
And so. So is the C. The member by definition is summation y minus Y, part squared, correct?

161
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:42,080
Why is the observed life expectancy?

162
00:22:49,790 --> 00:23:00,170
And why have these the predicted. So of course, we're used to seeing, you know,

163
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:11,300
the observer and y kept or the predicted life expectancy is also the same under the two models under the,

164
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:22,420
you know, like the different set of building understandings for. So y y you have the same between the two models.

165
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:29,440
Therefore, the sum of scarcity, which is some Asian y element, is why I have square on the same.

166
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:40,080
Okay. So it might sort of seem surprising or counterintuitive.

167
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:56,490
It is. But the and the reason why they're the same is that the predicted y y hat is the same for both models.

168
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:15,280
Okay. Now, here is another question.

169
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:24,520
This is a slightly. I think that slightly trickier question.

170
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:32,080
But all we have to do is kind of think about it a bit carefully.

171
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:37,180
Hmm. Oh, I forgot to mention one thing.

172
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:48,340
So for the num in. Ah, when you put all the dummy variables in, you see that any and any meaning that you know,

173
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:55,060
not estimable you have a less than full rank matrix and, and so on.

174
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,340
What sass does is anybody in the SAS is SAS.

175
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:10,749
Firstly, as I said, give you a warning that X is less than full rank and it automatically drops one indicator and it's the last

176
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:23,049
indicator drops and it also automatically forces that to be a reference group and it kind of takes care of that.

177
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:29,740
And the coefficients are computed exactly the same way that Art does here.

178
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:45,110
But I just forgot to mention aside that. But I also know that while it did not drop it, sort of like by giving you that any.

179
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:51,170
It sort of implicitly just for that to be that there the reference to.

180
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:56,960
But what says does it say though it's less than full then and it drops that from the model and down.

181
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:00,949
So that's the. Okay.

182
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:12,860
So now the question is why does a linear model without an intercept meaning for to the origin have a higher R-squared value.

183
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:18,310
And it's kind of let's see it in the context of this model.

184
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:23,900
So by linear model without an intercept, basically referring to the cell means falling.

185
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:30,679
Okay, so the same means for the first I like to point out in this previous slide,

186
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:38,059
I see that that if you compare the sums of squares across the two models, the individual, some subscripts are different.

187
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:49,580
And do you see like how different they are? They are like different almost by a scale of sometimes like that huge the this is

188
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:58,010
the cell means loading and this is the difference through reference cell folding.

189
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:04,790
So the different cell coding has only for dummies. The cell means coding has five dummies.

190
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:12,350
The different cell 14 has an intercept, but the same means coding does not have any intercept.

191
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:16,729
So if you compare the sum of squares, the same means.

192
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:33,770
14 The individual some subscripts are huge, so if you add them up like the total sum of squares is is going to be a really big number.

193
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:43,730
And let's go back to the output from the cell means for me and see what I generated as the r squared.

194
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:56,180
So here is the output from the cell means coding. I did not want your attention to this quantity before deliberately so if you see like.

195
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:07,420
Art says that the multiple art world is 199 and just as good as 19912.

196
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:19,290
And for the reference still holding the at this date are spread in the multiplied square with 1435.

197
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:28,540
The artist did ask for this point forward three. So what is going on I mean you it's the same model get the same predictions.

198
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:35,800
So why is that r squared. Like, you know,

199
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:52,809
like .99 and and and why is it that you know for the reference group holding it's basically a 4.45 this the model without an intercept meaning

200
00:28:52,810 --> 00:29:04,170
the cell means for the model has a why does it have but it seems like an artificially inflated square is treating the intercept as the.

201
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:13,890
Because The Intercept does look at the parameters for South America in the in the know what was happening.

202
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:19,139
And then you look at the intercept, I think they're all identified. So it's just at the second level stream.

203
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:22,680
This is an area. Just about.

204
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:35,630
Yes. Somewhat and continue sort of like tell me what if any any of that's that's an answer.

205
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:44,390
But maybe I want to hear from others if they have any other way of seeing what's going on.

206
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:54,330
So maybe I will ask you a follow up question. So, like, what do you think about that?

207
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:59,410
Is this why? In the new intercept module.

208
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:08,020
So the Essence flight is by definition in our bread and butter intercept model is summation y minus y bar squared.

209
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:15,110
That's as much. But then there is more intercept.

210
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:28,809
What? What happens to this is why. As his wife's party and larger.

211
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:36,880
But then you can tell me that definitely longevity would be a big number because you are adding up.

212
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:47,740
I mean, even if I had to do it with an example, as this one says, why is why saying this this is the thing.

213
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:55,840
Yeah, but is this why would be the sum of all of these five year and all of the six here.

214
00:30:56,170 --> 00:31:02,379
Yeah. And each of the sums of squares for the corresponding dummies are hugely larger.

215
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:08,670
Is it because the features of the zero. Something like this is quite a hassle, etc. etc.

216
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:19,240
I mean, you do realize that there is this y from this model, but this model,

217
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:25,930
the second model that is is why is believing that it's actually I even had the.

218
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:36,060
I think I wrote down what the value is. Anyway, it's a it's a hugely inflated bed.

219
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:46,400
But what is what is happening here? I mean, you kind of going in the right direction, but so little did what is happening so well,

220
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:55,670
there is no intersect like when it's forced to the origin without actually like,

221
00:31:55,670 --> 00:32:03,890
you know, a politically plausible reason not to have a migration to the origin.

222
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:14,179
What is happening is that is why actually oh, here I did, general, and this is why.

223
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:19,400
So this is the it's this why from the cell means for the new intercept model.

224
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,290
And what is happening is that it's actually.

225
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:36,990
Instead of being submission y minus y bar squared.

226
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:43,540
It's actually this thing. I think I thought that's what I meant.

227
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:47,679
Yeah. No, I. That's why I said you. You said it.

228
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:53,710
But I was hoping that I would collect answers from also see it in a different way.

229
00:32:54,520 --> 00:33:04,360
So that's, that's what is going on now is this why is summation Y squared and in R squared

230
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:10,750
when the intercept is left out and it does not have a true zero effect.

231
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:22,329
So in other words, there is not a true line to the origin, then the ss y is obsolete.

232
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:29,800
Then the SS are the sum of goods and due to regression is artificially increased.

233
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:47,370
And it turns out that our square, in fact does not have an interpretation of percent variance of y explained by the model.

234
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:56,790
So bottom line is don't use R squared from model without Intersect and I think

235
00:33:56,790 --> 00:34:03,930
I'm going to write it here in the previous slide or maybe I'll write it here.

236
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:29,690
Don't use Arthur. From a model with no interest because it does not have the usual interpretation of the person, Williams explained.

237
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:39,900
By the Egyptian model. So that's what's going on.

238
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:50,160
It's not that the models suddenly became like nearly perfect, almost in explaining the variability.

239
00:34:50,160 --> 00:35:07,739
It says that the SSR becomes artificially increased because of the view that it's this y is calculated and so it becomes optical,

240
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:11,430
loses its interpretation. Okay.

241
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:19,260
Which tends. So you begin.

242
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:36,270
In the nineties, a commodity that is like if you can do that again, the sort of beliefs where it's estimated there's there's no big enough.

243
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:51,370
So you can the model Y you do the least squares estimation using the baby up in any squares estimate there's.

244
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:59,700
And right. This is why. So that's what going on.

245
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:13,400
Okay. So now I want to find a model using the fact that function.

246
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:30,120
So the fact their function is in are basically just assumes that the continent

247
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:38,850
variable is nominal categorical has these levels and it is kind of a direct way of,

248
00:36:39,370 --> 00:36:43,980
you know, bypassing the reference body but fitting exactly the same one.

249
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:48,360
So here it meets Africa,

250
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:58,499
the reference group the first get the values that at first and it fits the again a

251
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:06,420
model using the reference cell called the multiply squared if you can see that 135.

252
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:15,810
So you know this should match with the output from your reference cell coding model.

253
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:21,690
Now what is the reference group?

254
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:30,300
The reference group here is. Africa.

255
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:40,350
Okay. So you should be able to once again compute the predicted means for each of the continent.

256
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:44,370
So now for Africa, it will be 59.28.

257
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:49,470
For Asia it would be 59.28 plus 5.95.

258
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:55,020
For Europe it would be 59.28 plus 15.26 and so on.

259
00:37:57,580 --> 00:38:10,070
Okay. So this is another labor factor function lets you directly kind of like do the reference loading representation of the model and you know,

260
00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:18,850
do the models it. Now I'm asking the sort of convincing you that it is indeed a reference coding.

261
00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:28,390
So I say, you know, fit the model using the dummy variables to get the same model as the factor function do.

262
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:38,110
So all I have to do is I have to me Africa is the reference group so I know fit the model using.

263
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:46,929
I leave out the dummy variable for Africa from the model I include the dummy for Asia, Europe, North America,

264
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:56,110
South America and repeat the model and I low and behold, I get the exact same table of coefficients.

265
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:09,459
Okay. So nothing. No surprise. The point of this slide in the previous slide is that essentially we can keep the differential coding

266
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:16,840
model either to dominate e-books incorporated in the model or using the fact that functions are.

267
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:27,840
Okay. So no one better analog cables for these two models.

268
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:33,600
So this is based on the fact, the function and this is based on the reference cell coding.

269
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:44,600
So if you add up the force, the sizes are going to be exactly the same.

270
00:39:44,610 --> 00:39:52,710
That is better than nothing. We saw that before even for comparing the reference cell versus the cell means for these models.

271
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:59,490
But what about the SSR? The SSR from the factory?

272
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:07,740
The function based model is 20 22311967.

273
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:16,260
And you can convince yourself that this is equal to the sum of these forward pains.

274
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:26,070
Three 36.1 plus seven 74.92 plus 5.5 73.57 plus five 47.27.

275
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:38,610
So the sum of the squared or both or dummy variables will be equal to the sum of squares for the fact the quantity that you want.

276
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:50,550
And that's what we are seeing here. Okay, so this together and we get.

277
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:57,400
It would 31167.

278
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:12,200
Okay. So now did you have a question?

279
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:34,770
This one. Then there's this one comparing this and it's in step based reference and using the last thing that we ran was.

280
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:47,200
Yeah. Why don't we get closer it and just keep doing this for the details for this one, and then that will make it very different, maybe.

281
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:53,430
Yeah. Okay. I. He used to say, maybe you get to.

282
00:41:55,810 --> 00:42:03,969
In Las Vegas. Yeah. So you can use any group that doesn't even have to be that fast.

283
00:42:03,970 --> 00:42:15,970
And the last like you are seeing some of the estimates, I go negative in the past 40 year old estimates and of these and what are the estimates?

284
00:42:15,970 --> 00:42:25,209
What are some of the estimates? What has to make and make them do what has to be exactly equal?

285
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:30,850
Ah, do I get this seeing estimated life expectancy for the continents.

286
00:42:30,850 --> 00:42:34,210
I've heard that the markets that these markets have.

287
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:50,139
Right. So why is it that in the first model some of the estimates you got as negative South America was the year was up what hurricanes to South

288
00:42:50,140 --> 00:43:09,400
America if you go back and let's first try to con convince you from the computed means so South America was basically 69.1 in the second one.

289
00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:17,350
And compared to South them, sort of when South America was the reference, Africa was mean.

290
00:43:17,350 --> 00:43:23,560
Life expectancy is 59.2. It's it's almost like ten years slower.

291
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:30,040
So that's why you got a negative ten as the estimate for the coefficient for Africa

292
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:40,389
in the first model and for Asia you got a negative four as the estimate and

293
00:43:40,390 --> 00:43:55,570
for for Europe and North America you gotta positive now for the reference group

294
00:43:55,930 --> 00:44:01,840
so now make the first one first category Africa is your reference to Africa.

295
00:44:02,410 --> 00:44:09,340
What is the continent that has the lowest according to this data life expectancy.

296
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:24,340
So you are comparing all the other continents against that 59 So it's not surprising that the coefficients for all the other dummies will be positive.

297
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:32,770
That's what is going on. So it's it's not about the positive negative coefficients.

298
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:43,299
It's ultimately because you know what the interpretation of the proficiency change with these two different boarding schemes in the first one,

299
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:51,410
it's the interpretation with respect to South America, I think the lesson one that the interpretation is with respect to Africa.

300
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:57,060
So does it make sense that something's going on? So it depends on the means of it.

301
00:44:57,430 --> 00:45:12,610
And yeah, so I'm one of the ladies that models are exactly who valid and the what not is interpreting is the point Christians attached to the dummies.

302
00:45:13,990 --> 00:45:19,480
The other interpretation changes depending on the on the reference group.

303
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:31,180
But what doesn't change are the estimated means for each level of the period because basically those are exactly the same.

304
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:38,350
And just as an aside, no, there's nothing wholly about the first or the last category.

305
00:45:39,550 --> 00:45:42,730
You can me anything as the reference group.

306
00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:48,340
Okay. And the same argument would hold.

307
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:53,890
Okay. So, no, it was okay.

308
00:45:54,580 --> 00:46:01,020
So we were. So we went here.

309
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:09,570
So now interpret each row of the results in in this output that I use the factor function.

310
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:15,450
So can, can we convince ourselves that we get exactly the same results as before?

311
00:46:15,810 --> 00:46:18,900
So now the reference group is Africa.

312
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:23,420
So what is the estimated mean?

313
00:46:23,610 --> 00:46:31,910
The predicted mean life expectancy for Africa is to be done at that rate, which is 59.48.

314
00:46:33,570 --> 00:46:38,640
What is the expected life expectancy for based on this model?

315
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:42,300
So I'm usually going to use this column here.

316
00:46:42,870 --> 00:46:50,880
For Asia, it would be 59.8 plus 5.95.

317
00:46:54,590 --> 00:47:07,070
Yes. For Europe it will be 59.28 plus 15.4607.

318
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:17,800
And so on. And do you see now that these exactly match what we had in before.

319
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:24,700
Numerically for the difference pudding with South America as the.

320
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:33,020
As the reference to it is within this.

321
00:47:34,130 --> 00:47:38,210
So that's what is going on. Okay.

322
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:43,040
Now, let's figure out what you with on the podium.

323
00:47:43,070 --> 00:47:49,790
So remember, we had this was the primary variable of interest, the continent.

324
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:56,000
But we also have gender.

325
00:47:56,030 --> 00:48:01,490
We also have birth since birth television and persons for me.

326
00:48:02,090 --> 00:48:06,260
So this is mine. This is kind of my end of the module.

327
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:14,350
I have two factor variables gender, which is binary and continent.

328
00:48:14,770 --> 00:48:26,920
But I also have these continuous covariates for underscore TV and for underscore me and and that's what I get.

329
00:48:28,750 --> 00:48:39,700
Okay, so now what is the interpretation of the intercept in this model?

330
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:51,760
So the reference group here is for continent the references Africa and let's see.

331
00:48:52,050 --> 00:48:57,870
Gender. Male is one and females is zero.

332
00:48:58,890 --> 00:49:02,290
So the references means.

333
00:49:06,690 --> 00:49:14,710
Oh. So the difference is females. So what is the interpretation of the intercept?

334
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:23,590
Was a few minutes in Africa.

335
00:49:24,070 --> 00:49:35,160
That's it for me. At this point.

336
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:45,760
It's 11000 doctors.

337
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:49,760
Neither of which really make it so.

338
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:53,510
So he is the you are the first black guy.

339
00:49:53,810 --> 00:50:06,150
So it's the average. I predicted life expectancy for females in Africa, not just at just 18 for 14, but making for the environment equal to zero.

340
00:50:08,510 --> 00:50:18,980
And that's where the problems may not be interpretable, maybe meaningless, actually, of the fringe.

341
00:50:23,790 --> 00:50:30,720
What percentage of the variation in life expectancy is explained by gender alone?

342
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:44,970
How can I find that? So this is easy.

343
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:57,780
So basically I'm saying let's compute the extra sum of squares due to gender given only be done on being the models.

344
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:10,560
Divided by is this. And that's what I did. So fitted a model with only gender.

345
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:35,280
It's a cool model and I get like the sum of squares here five inside due to gender and divide that by the ss y which in this case is 40 625 +505.

346
00:51:36,390 --> 00:51:45,270
So that's what I do and I get a value of 9.8%.

347
00:51:45,270 --> 00:51:50,910
So this is an nice work on the model with only six.

348
00:51:56,680 --> 00:52:12,190
Okay. So that's, again, you know, just showing that.

349
00:52:15,330 --> 00:52:19,700
And in you know, you know,

350
00:52:19,710 --> 00:52:33,420
sort of you think would the annual function as well as the some substance from fitting the model

351
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:46,660
that the does the cube model and you know be met so that's not like the the once again it's 9.8.

352
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:55,050
Okay. So now I am asking this.

353
00:52:55,050 --> 00:52:59,760
Consider the percentage of variation explained by the model with all Floridians.

354
00:53:00,450 --> 00:53:07,919
What fraction of this percentage is attributable to the pardon me and for the people we it?

355
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:14,819
So basically everybody model with all the cool with its gender continent party report MP And I'm asking

356
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:23,130
what fraction of this percentage is attributable to the continuous covidiots for me and for TV?

357
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,450
So who wants to tell me how to approach this?

358
00:53:27,690 --> 00:53:33,780
I mean, let's do the calculations later. Just conceptually tell me how can I do this?

359
00:54:20,030 --> 00:54:27,440
Can you say one more time? I think I concluded the first more meaningful and gets a little louder for you.

360
00:54:27,510 --> 00:54:38,300
I didn't hear. We don't need boring people be.

361
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:55,179
Uh. So I will I will think of stopping.

362
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:59,910
But I didn't ask you to read that the statement.

363
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:05,999
Consider the percentage of variation explained by the model we all formulated.

364
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:14,740
So I already have to give them all the. I'm asking I'm not talking about two different models.

365
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:19,990
I'm talking about within the model that was pulled up over the years.

366
00:55:21,550 --> 00:55:34,710
What percentage what fraction of the percentage of variation explained is attributable to the morning before the.

367
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:39,670
This is not some random.

368
00:55:45,790 --> 00:55:51,620
Yes. The more people come upstairs. This is. So.

369
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:58,930
Not so. So you write it within that, be on base and it is the sum of splits.

370
00:55:59,490 --> 00:56:04,820
Do you know what I think? What you mean? But what type of sums this.

371
00:56:09,810 --> 00:56:16,830
Do you see what I'm asking? What type of some of those things we talk about through different types of sounds of this sequence?

372
00:56:19,530 --> 00:56:23,100
Because the partial like this for everything is in the order.

373
00:56:24,510 --> 00:56:31,090
The sequence here kind of builds on the more. At the start.

374
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:40,320
So. Basically this is what is happening.

375
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:51,550
So these are I wish I could even show you the sort of the output from from SAS as well.

376
00:56:51,880 --> 00:57:07,700
So these are the sequential top squares. Who if you were in Berkshire, what would be the interpretation for the party?

377
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:13,050
It would be okay. Some of squares due to party be given.

378
00:57:13,070 --> 00:57:17,030
We cannot say continent party in B was already in the model.

379
00:57:21,090 --> 00:57:24,140
But for sequential what is the interpretation?

380
00:57:24,150 --> 00:57:26,430
It's the extra sum of squares due to.

381
00:57:27,060 --> 00:57:39,870
So this 716 is the extra sum of squares due to part B, given that I already had beaten R six and factored in the model.

382
00:57:44,750 --> 00:57:58,010
And what about the 21.55 that's that it's just as good as due to pardon me given I had six factor part pre already in the model and the McDonough.

383
00:58:01,750 --> 00:58:08,470
So you are right. It's the it's the sum of squares for part TV and part, but it's the sequence of squares.

384
00:58:09,430 --> 00:58:17,710
So if I now add this two up, 716 plus 21, that gives me.

385
00:58:23,470 --> 00:58:27,550
That leaves me. Um.

386
00:58:31,870 --> 00:58:36,910
What is that? Whatever it is, be divided by.

387
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:53,860
Divided by the total sum of squares, which is 505 plus two, two, three, one plus 716 plus 21 plus one, six, five, four.

388
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:59,050
And I get you can go on, you know, just add these up.

389
00:58:59,830 --> 00:59:06,880
You will get 5130. And this gives me .14.

390
00:59:10,430 --> 00:59:16,130
But I ask the question I asked is, oh, you know what?

391
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:22,370
So this is the percentage that is attributable to for me and for TV comedy.

392
00:59:22,370 --> 00:59:29,090
It's what I'm asking. Like, what fraction of the R squared is this percentage?

393
00:59:30,530 --> 00:59:37,040
And the R squared is basically from the if you calculate that,

394
00:59:37,370 --> 00:59:44,989
then it it basically gives you the percentage you'll have to just do that small arithmetic.

395
00:59:44,990 --> 00:59:55,340
So the percentage is point one, four divided by 1.67.

396
00:59:55,940 --> 01:00:00,200
Uh, this is the R squared from the amicable model.

397
01:00:01,130 --> 01:00:05,930
And so the fraction is, I think it's going to line up.

398
01:00:11,210 --> 01:00:15,360
So the R-squared from this and one more.

399
01:00:20,050 --> 01:00:35,890
With Gender Continent Party before me is born six seven and 114 is the percentage attributable to for me and for TV.

400
01:00:36,340 --> 01:00:41,740
So the fraction is point one, 4.67, which gives you a .21.

401
01:00:41,860 --> 01:00:47,020
Yes, it's a question to ask. And another question is a woman a trick question?

402
01:00:47,170 --> 01:00:51,070
Okay. Is it a little unclear because it's like because doesn't it?

403
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:58,900
It's a punch hole, right? So won't the amount of fraction of a fraction of a percent depend on how early or how early?

404
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:02,560
Because so much is her engine for TV for the first two,

405
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:11,460
I imagine that the fraction of research would be a little bit higher since you don't have other variables that kind of take away from nor.

406
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:23,230
Okay. Okay. So that question, I believe, has a clear answer from the statement, because I am deliberately that's like 1514 before TV, PBS.

407
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:29,790
Because I'm. I'm answering the question.

408
01:01:29,790 --> 01:01:39,240
What fraction of the percentage of variation explained is attributable to the part B and part B before?

409
01:01:40,770 --> 01:01:50,100
So I need the extra sum of squares duplicate figure and for me, given I have beaten out the gender continent in the model.

410
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:58,290
So that's why I'm deliberately fitting the part in the end for typical idiots last I would have to fit them fast.

411
01:01:59,220 --> 01:02:06,150
Does that make sense yet? Like why? If it's not, why have you not seen those will be.

412
01:02:06,150 --> 01:02:15,270
It's early on. Yeah, I figured early on that some subscripts will change, but that's why I deliberately don't fit them or beyond.

413
01:02:15,270 --> 01:02:26,280
Because ultimately, at the end of the day, what I want is maybe I could care to answer this question.

414
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:33,070
I needed the extra sum of squares. Boo Boo.

415
01:02:39,670 --> 01:02:44,230
It's the sum of squares due to podium B for TV.

416
01:02:46,660 --> 01:02:52,810
Given the eternal gender and fontenelle been the model.

417
01:02:56,580 --> 01:03:03,390
So this is what I needed. So if I need this extra thumb square,

418
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:19,260
I cannot put it in there and be fast because I wouldn't make the sequential sum of squares aligned with this extra time.

419
01:03:19,470 --> 01:03:24,030
But so does that make sense? Part of the question why is this so much?

420
01:03:24,630 --> 01:03:28,650
Is it the thing where it's just a fraction of this? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

421
01:03:43,050 --> 01:03:48,390
I mean, he said maybe, maybe as big as it was then.

422
01:03:49,740 --> 01:03:53,720
Could there be a clearer way of asking this question? Yes.

423
01:03:53,730 --> 01:03:57,750
I mean, just given that dollars are already being given the feeling.

424
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:12,000
Okay. I see. I see. Would it be the same?

425
01:04:14,710 --> 01:04:19,810
But. The last. And getting partial.

426
01:04:20,810 --> 01:04:26,340
SS So that. Some say.

427
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:33,300
The. Partial.

428
01:04:36,310 --> 01:04:43,480
Yeah, it could be. But then how are you going to get into the fashion for the people buying?

429
01:04:43,490 --> 01:04:55,180
Because the other thing you kind of have to you will have to create outside the element of the variable, which is a combination of those two.

430
01:05:00,740 --> 01:05:05,270
Because the minute you put in a separate 4 minutes in the morning, the portion of the.

431
01:05:06,470 --> 01:05:13,370
If you want. And if I switched to.

432
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:18,840
Then they know it's going to be fine. They know it's going to be fine.

433
01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:30,180
That it's the secret insurance software for the CCB would be higher and the envy would be smaller, but together the sum would be the same.

434
01:05:34,410 --> 01:05:39,040
Okay. The fraction.

435
01:06:00,990 --> 01:06:08,540
So sorry last time. Yes.

436
01:06:11,620 --> 01:06:17,980
Because it's it's just extra small square for the party and the party.

437
01:06:18,130 --> 01:06:21,420
Even everything as divided by this is wise.

438
01:06:21,850 --> 01:06:25,030
And on the bottom you have is this or what is this? Why?

439
01:06:25,030 --> 01:06:28,060
So this is why gets canceled then? Yes, you're right.

440
01:06:29,910 --> 01:06:35,270
So that's another way to do that. But the bottom line is you have to give the.

441
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:45,149
Okay. Any other questions? Okay.

442
01:06:45,150 --> 01:06:51,420
If not, then let's take a break here and it's 910.

443
01:06:51,420 --> 01:06:59,230
So please come back at 920 and we will stop talking about interactions.

444
01:06:59,950 --> 01:07:05,786
And this is also a lot of fun. So we need to get the truth.

445
01:07:14,011 --> 01:07:17,051
So if you go to canvas.

446
01:07:18,391 --> 01:07:21,691
Your group assignments have been posted on canvas.

447
01:07:23,881 --> 01:07:29,511
And as I mentioned last week, the final project is a group project.

448
01:07:29,641 --> 01:07:43,741
And each group we work together in unison on on the project and provide a report at the end of the semester.

449
01:07:44,591 --> 01:07:55,801
In terms of these assignments, I will take of the assignments and not the the project is not posted, but the group assignments that have been posted.

450
01:07:55,921 --> 01:07:59,751
If not, then we will submit a piece of the.

451
01:08:02,791 --> 01:08:06,261
And it's not okay. So I will talk to the DSA because they.

452
01:08:08,521 --> 01:08:13,051
We talked about them hosting the assignment. So here is what is going to happen.

453
01:08:14,431 --> 01:08:20,641
Everything that you are going to see a lot of flurry on campus this by this evening.

454
01:08:21,151 --> 01:08:26,791
And I want to make sure what is sort of give you a preview of what he's talking about.

455
01:08:27,151 --> 01:08:33,060
So you will get three things. You will get your group assignments.

456
01:08:33,061 --> 01:08:35,341
And that's what I was talking about. What is that?

457
01:08:35,341 --> 01:08:48,751
So like for the final drugs, if you will, a walk in groups of four and at the end of the term, you are going to produce a project report.

458
01:08:50,131 --> 01:09:00,121
And that has to be, again, like a collaboration between all the members of the Law Board in terms of like,

459
01:09:00,121 --> 01:09:09,691
you know, sort of doing the analysis like the typical revision of the of the report and so on.

460
01:09:10,111 --> 01:09:22,111
And then you'll also have to do a presentation and the last few days of the semester are dedicated to book and student presentations.

461
01:09:23,251 --> 01:09:31,111
Anything happened in this room because we are going to again bring together the food sections to the presence so that you learn from each other.

462
01:09:31,831 --> 01:09:37,410
So the first thing that you are going to get is the group assignments.

463
01:09:37,411 --> 01:09:46,050
So Blue is teamed up with form and we deliberately tried to a mix of the two sections

464
01:09:46,051 --> 01:09:55,441
so that each group will at least have some members from more than sections,

465
01:09:55,441 --> 01:10:04,681
like typically two members from section one because it's, it's a bigger section and one member from Section two.

466
01:10:04,741 --> 01:10:12,071
But the fourth member, I believe in some cases it's from section goes in a different section one.

467
01:10:12,331 --> 01:10:15,571
Okay. So that's going to be the groups.

468
01:10:15,901 --> 01:10:25,801
And you should the first thing that you should do is after you get your group assignments, you should actually connect with your group members.

469
01:10:28,021 --> 01:10:33,451
Hey, we are group member. So we have to work on this together and sort of establish that contact.

470
01:10:34,351 --> 01:10:44,671
The next the other thing that you will get at a rather to other thing that you will get are firstly the data and the description of the data.

471
01:10:45,751 --> 01:10:59,251
So there will be a, you know, the spreadsheet with the data and there will be description of the details of what the study objectives are,

472
01:11:01,831 --> 01:11:10,051
or I should say what group, what the primary outcome of interest is, what are the predictors of interest, and so on.

473
01:11:11,641 --> 01:11:17,521
And then you'll also get the general guideline for the project.

474
01:11:17,761 --> 01:11:30,331
So y unlike the homeworks and homeworks we tell you, like do this after this, do that, follow this step and we kind of guide you to the process.

475
01:11:32,941 --> 01:11:36,601
This is not going to be like that.

476
01:11:37,121 --> 01:11:45,331
B This is going to be more like a really boring set up scenario,

477
01:11:46,531 --> 01:11:54,981
typically that you will sort of understand as a statistician confronting the bad for the meeting next year.

478
01:11:55,051 --> 01:12:05,611
It's not that. I mean, basically what happens in the end, like, you know, you sit with an investigator and talk about their study,

479
01:12:05,611 --> 01:12:11,731
what the scientific objectives are, and then you try to make sense of the data.

480
01:12:12,511 --> 01:12:20,670
I am not there might be some is not that often you get this by reading association first you get this exploratory drafts.

481
01:12:20,671 --> 01:12:23,970
Does this look like does it then fit this model?

482
01:12:23,971 --> 01:12:31,141
Then will you draft formation and you get both in the cabinet vehicle for the to get in directions?

483
01:12:31,471 --> 01:12:33,211
We will not do that,

484
01:12:33,871 --> 01:12:45,810
but we will give you general guidelines as to what typically you should look at in the context of that will be done in this scenario.

485
01:12:45,811 --> 01:12:53,281
We will also that that that document will also have a guidelines about what should be the length of the report,

486
01:12:54,421 --> 01:13:02,191
how should you choose the looks and features. So this is like for probably more stuff.

487
01:13:05,101 --> 01:13:15,121
This might either be the first or kind of merely the first real data analysts experience.

488
01:13:16,151 --> 01:13:25,771
You have to kind of write your findings more like the typical manuscript may not be a manuscript,

489
01:13:27,421 --> 01:13:31,561
may not be like a journal article, but people tell you like follow that style.

490
01:13:31,601 --> 01:13:32,821
So you should have a background.

491
01:13:32,881 --> 01:13:38,161
You should have a method, you should have a results, you should have a conference, and we'll give you guidelines about that.

492
01:13:38,671 --> 01:13:43,641
So coming back, this may be the the first kind of nearly the first,

493
01:13:43,651 --> 01:13:58,921
but this is this should be like the sort of a gentle introduction into what 699 would be like in 689,

494
01:13:58,931 --> 01:14:06,361
you would sort of be and I don't want to use the word in a kind of obscurity, we were going to be kind of cloning.

495
01:14:06,361 --> 01:14:09,691
Do you have learned all of this techniques? Here is the data.

496
01:14:11,221 --> 01:14:22,621
Both people sort of like repeat the study objectives good enough for this is more of a very, very gentle informed group, that type of setting.

497
01:14:22,621 --> 01:14:26,941
But the focus is what you learned in this class in any session.

498
01:14:27,781 --> 01:14:35,731
And and the reason why we want you to work in themes is because we really believe that,

499
01:14:38,101 --> 01:14:46,441
you know, it's the sort of it should be like the theme Walk and Learn to collaboration.

500
01:14:47,171 --> 01:14:56,191
Yes. So somebody might say, hey, I think we can fit this, but somebody else has another suggestion.

501
01:14:56,211 --> 01:15:03,311
So you should walk into and figure out what would be the best approach and resolve their differences, resolve that.

502
01:15:03,311 --> 01:15:10,451
And ultimately what you produce is your team effort and that gets reflected in the project.

503
01:15:10,451 --> 01:15:20,141
People as well as the presentation, in my experience, wouldn't say that,

504
01:15:21,161 --> 01:15:28,331
you know, we learn a lot and this is the much sought after publicity they get.

505
01:15:28,331 --> 01:15:36,491
It's in a way, an evaluation piece, but it's much better than an in-class final exam.

506
01:15:36,521 --> 01:15:42,461
And and typically for applied courses, this is the way you learn.

507
01:15:42,941 --> 01:15:47,521
And remember, biostatistics is very much a science.

508
01:15:47,561 --> 01:15:56,741
So this is also a way for them to kind of learn what in science looks like, a new you have to do and collaborate with others.

509
01:15:56,741 --> 01:16:01,781
And so that's the question the minute that's sort of the fun.

510
01:16:01,961 --> 01:16:06,131
So you you'll get all of this tonight. By tonight, I'm getting nervous.

511
01:16:08,261 --> 01:16:16,571
So the group assignments, the data set and the data description and then the guidelines for the project.

512
01:16:17,801 --> 01:16:22,931
Yes. Question How much do you answer?

513
01:16:23,291 --> 01:16:26,861
I give? Okay. Any other questions?

514
01:16:36,651 --> 01:16:43,101
We got a lot of people who didn't lose, but the same thing doesn't matter.

515
01:16:44,391 --> 01:16:58,851
So we will tell you what the outcome is Bibi believes and what the primary predictors of interest are and what the other will be in the dataset are.

516
01:16:59,931 --> 01:17:03,281
And then you can do that with this system.

517
01:17:03,741 --> 01:17:10,521
So it could be that groups have like the same analytic plans, analytic strategy, that's fine.

518
01:17:11,061 --> 01:17:16,970
But there are various ways in which the reports can differ in their approach,

519
01:17:16,971 --> 01:17:25,851
in their presentation and what people speakers they do and how they support for the the findings.

520
01:17:29,571 --> 01:17:34,011
So those are parts that, you know, that people tend.

521
01:17:39,081 --> 01:17:44,141
It's. You get the same dataset.

522
01:17:45,081 --> 01:17:52,551
But what we do with this group does with this we think it's up to us.

523
01:17:53,691 --> 01:18:00,601
And so there is there would be enough room for there.

524
01:18:00,651 --> 01:18:02,720
There is that there is a you know,

525
01:18:02,721 --> 01:18:10,851
we've always said so you will get the same dataset as you would see and we will define the outcomes and the primary predictors of the interest.

526
01:18:12,561 --> 01:18:25,581
So there is that distinction, but there's enough room for individuality and creativity across groups that the reports can reflect.

527
01:18:29,541 --> 01:18:38,141
Okay. Any other. No.

528
01:18:38,471 --> 01:18:42,281
Then let's.

529
01:18:47,251 --> 01:18:52,651
Let's start talking about interactions.

530
01:18:56,981 --> 01:19:07,181
So module AI is where we will introduce the concept of interactions.

531
01:19:07,211 --> 01:19:20,681
Here is a brief outline of the topics, so we will first introduce more meetings with improved interactions.

532
01:19:22,541 --> 01:19:28,781
Then we will talk about integrating better the from the interaction model.

533
01:19:30,881 --> 01:19:36,871
Specifically, we will talk about interactions involving Japanese political events.

534
01:19:37,901 --> 01:19:43,271
And then. And then we will basically end with some examples.

535
01:19:45,481 --> 01:19:59,851
So the multiple linear regression that we have been talking about so far is that, you know, we started with this model,

536
01:20:00,991 --> 01:20:10,470
a linear regression model, let's say I like to call BD its excite line and excite two so I can write y as big does not look good.

537
01:20:10,471 --> 01:20:15,721
I wanted to say one plus beta to excite Duplass Epsilon AI where it's one and x2 and that will be it.

538
01:20:16,321 --> 01:20:20,371
Or we can alternatively write in terms of the mean function.

539
01:20:21,061 --> 01:20:37,381
So expected y given x1 x2 is a linear function of x1 and so we do not flood the beta one X1 plus beta two.

540
01:20:38,081 --> 01:20:44,761
So that's the so the mean is a linear function of the convenience.

541
01:20:46,261 --> 01:20:52,531
So now we call the interpretation of the comedy.

542
01:20:52,531 --> 01:21:01,771
It's what did we say be done on The Intercept is that it's the mean y then all, all we need set equal to zero right.

543
01:21:02,491 --> 01:21:14,491
And we talked about like is this a we need for interpretation and and in the context of the data and we argued that

544
01:21:14,491 --> 01:21:24,091
most often this is not a meaningful interpretation given that all the over the event input be zero is equal to zero.

545
01:21:24,361 --> 01:21:30,541
The is we people who will not be, you know, plausible.

546
01:21:31,381 --> 01:21:40,621
So but this will be talked about and we will talk a lot more about how we can say, therefore, maybe it will get a more definitive will be done.

547
01:21:40,621 --> 01:21:49,411
But nevertheless, that's based on what about middle on beta one is the mean change in y or I should be

548
01:21:49,431 --> 01:21:56,010
at least we can see mean difference in Y for exactly the same reasons that we talked

549
01:21:56,011 --> 01:22:04,201
about very early on when you said it depends on the design like you know is it's safe

550
01:22:04,311 --> 01:22:15,811
to say mean difference in Y but you need higher in a one with X to hold constant.

551
01:22:15,811 --> 01:22:31,561
So just that I made the change in the in the sort of the phrasing to respect the design for this is much safer to say because when we talk

552
01:22:31,561 --> 01:22:44,041
about change sort of has that underlying connotation that there is a longitudinal design or maybe like a bonfire type of experiment.

553
01:22:44,051 --> 01:22:48,451
So anyway, without getting too much digressed or hang on hung up on this.

554
01:22:48,721 --> 01:22:54,091
So beta one is the main difference in y body nikitin x one with x two held constant.

555
01:22:55,081 --> 01:23:07,321
What about beta two between would be similarly the mean difference in y or you higher in x2 with x1 held constant to that same depredation.

556
01:23:07,681 --> 01:23:20,191
No, as you can see to interpret beta one in beta two and for example to interpret beta one, we did not need to specify any value of x2.

557
01:23:20,521 --> 01:23:28,320
We just see only like call that constant or adjusting for x2.

558
01:23:28,321 --> 01:23:32,881
So the only specification was that it be held constant.

559
01:23:36,061 --> 01:23:46,741
Okay. So the implicit assumption is that the effect of X1 is equal across all values of x2.

560
01:23:48,541 --> 01:23:52,291
That's the interpretation of beta one.

561
01:23:56,131 --> 01:24:04,441
So this morning here to Philly, this is kind of a review.

562
01:24:06,091 --> 01:24:19,381
So this model on slide three assumes that X1 and X2 do not interact with respect to that effect on y.

563
01:24:19,771 --> 01:24:30,841
What does it mean when we when I say the do not be direct meaning that how it's going to fix y does not depend on x2 or how we do it.

564
01:24:31,081 --> 01:24:41,651
Why does not depend on x1? So that's what I mean by there is no interaction or it's fun and it's to do not interact.

565
01:24:42,161 --> 01:24:50,851
And in epidemiology, this is called no effect modification.

566
01:24:50,891 --> 01:24:58,601
The people who are picking a B, you know that this is a terminology sort of no effect.

567
01:24:58,601 --> 01:25:13,481
Modification in epi means no interaction in step by step or on the interaction step by step is basically every quantification in it.

568
01:25:13,841 --> 01:25:24,581
So these these are sort of, you know, kind of and these terminologies are used sort of almost in exchangeable with.

569
01:25:25,751 --> 01:25:33,371
The bottom line is that the effect of X1 is the same regardless of the values of X2 and vice versa.

570
01:25:33,371 --> 01:25:37,451
The effect of x2 is the same regardless of the values of X1.

571
01:25:40,081 --> 01:25:43,740
Now. How do we eat? How do we incorporate it into actions?

572
01:25:43,741 --> 01:25:51,001
Employment? First, let's talk about that and then we'll talk about the interpretation.

573
01:25:51,361 --> 01:26:01,231
So the way you would model interactions and you would model it if it modification is to product terms.

574
01:26:01,921 --> 01:26:07,531
So now the model is Y, you are equal to paternot plus beta one x.

575
01:26:07,531 --> 01:26:21,271
I want that beta to excite i. This is the part that we kind of had from previous slide, but now I can extract on beta three x say one.

576
01:26:22,121 --> 01:26:34,591
It's side two through the growth brought up between X1 and it's two and the coefficient beta three associated with that cross product.

577
01:26:35,101 --> 01:26:39,751
This is how we incorporate interactions into our model.

578
01:26:41,461 --> 01:26:48,261
Why is the divine intervention function? Why is it a product and not any function of it?

579
01:26:48,611 --> 01:26:55,891
It's one. What does give me some examples of what what are the what kind of functions?

580
01:26:57,991 --> 01:27:02,701
Of the major players. Okay.

581
01:27:03,011 --> 01:27:06,541
So you can really do that.

582
01:27:08,191 --> 01:27:11,631
So and so it's fun.

583
01:27:11,641 --> 01:27:18,271
What, it's two or x1, x1, square one. But I mean, those are fairly expensive for exploring that issue.

584
01:27:18,271 --> 01:27:22,260
It's going to be the are usually estimates.

585
01:27:22,261 --> 01:27:36,841
So it's fairly clear that we can say because any general function of F if that's two reasons here why is it that F is unknown?

586
01:27:36,931 --> 01:27:41,731
So there is another extra layer of estimation that makes things life complicated.

587
01:27:42,121 --> 01:27:56,730
Plus, secondly, when we're talking about interaction, we really don't care about the functional form, like how we get fixed, how we get fixed.

588
01:27:56,731 --> 01:28:03,991
We'll be sort of bean to be that three bar under a linear plot.

589
01:28:05,431 --> 01:28:14,461
So that's why we use the product because all we are saying is that how it swan impacts Y depends on x2,

590
01:28:14,971 --> 01:28:21,421
depends on excluding what we I don't care what I do here in terms of the formulation of the model,

591
01:28:22,561 --> 01:28:32,101
I can see based on the data underlying model how that exactly behaves to assess

592
01:28:32,101 --> 01:28:39,631
whether it's a synergistic interaction or no kind of ambivalent interaction.

593
01:28:41,401 --> 01:28:45,301
So that's the reason. Okay. So now,

594
01:28:46,681 --> 01:29:02,391
so that's how I would model the interaction and the terminologies that they use for this model is beta one and beta two are the other

595
01:29:02,461 --> 01:29:15,061
coefficients associated with X1 and x2 are referred to as the main effect parameters and beta three is referred to as the interaction parameter.

596
01:29:15,931 --> 01:29:20,611
So in the previous slide, I had the mean effects model.

597
01:29:20,611 --> 01:29:26,011
So this model does not have the interaction term.

598
01:29:27,511 --> 01:29:33,151
So this model would be referred to as the mean effect model and the model.

599
01:29:33,181 --> 01:29:49,171
In the next slide, this model would be referred to as an interaction model and the interaction is modeled to the cross brought up between x1 x2.

600
01:29:50,911 --> 01:29:57,461
Okay. Types of interaction. And I think I just started talking about that.

601
01:29:57,481 --> 01:30:04,111
The common types of interactions. Synergistic with X1 strengthens the x2 effect.

602
01:30:07,711 --> 01:30:12,901
And then when you see that it's one week and the to affect.

603
01:30:17,051 --> 01:30:20,651
And how do you determine synergism versus antagonism?

604
01:30:21,761 --> 01:30:28,951
Basically, you would use the model with the interaction term and it would look at that sign of the beta trigger efficient,

605
01:30:29,591 --> 01:30:34,001
the parameter associated with the Prospero Netflix context.

606
01:30:35,291 --> 01:30:44,721
So that would tell you that there be that these positive or negative would tell you whether the interaction is synergistic or antagonistic.

607
01:30:44,741 --> 01:30:48,161
And of course, then you'll also test the significance of the interaction.

608
01:30:48,161 --> 01:30:58,151
So they would pull that off age nine, beta 3.0 versus beta three not because to didn't.

609
01:31:11,701 --> 01:31:19,111
Okay. Uh, if this test of hypothesis is not significant, then what do we say?

610
01:31:19,591 --> 01:31:31,201
That there is no effect modification? In other words, the effect of X1 does not vary by X2 or the effect of x2 does not vary by X1.

611
01:31:31,441 --> 01:31:42,720
So another point that I would like to make, so interaction by that, by the definition and by the nature of its definition is a symmetric relationship.

612
01:31:42,721 --> 01:31:49,111
And I say X1 and explore, interact, basically get out of the x2 x1 contract.

613
01:31:50,581 --> 01:31:57,511
So X1 and its two interact means how the x1 affects the outcome.

614
01:31:57,511 --> 01:32:06,211
Y depends on its do or how x2 affects y depends on x1 so that the relationship is symmetric.

615
01:32:07,291 --> 01:32:13,651
Okay. And then and then the what happens to the mean effect models?

616
01:32:13,651 --> 01:32:19,681
The mean effect models in contrast, estimate the average X1 and x2 effect.

617
01:32:19,681 --> 01:32:23,311
So that's the key word, the average the X1 and X2 effects.

618
01:32:29,641 --> 01:32:33,631
So some interpretation, how do we interpret the parameters in the interaction model?

619
01:32:34,051 --> 01:32:42,751
So let's what we call the main inputs model. The main effect model is the mean is a linear function of X1 and x2.

620
01:32:43,351 --> 01:32:56,581
Okay. So just as we had talked about in very early on when interpreting the the slope of from a simple linear regression model,

621
01:32:57,211 --> 01:33:04,231
we had said, okay, so the, you know, here is the mean linear function of the whole variance.

622
01:33:05,371 --> 01:33:12,390
So take the derivative with respect to X1 and from the mean effects model,

623
01:33:12,391 --> 01:33:21,421
what do you get to 50, the first order differential of the expression here with respect to X1.

624
01:33:21,841 --> 01:33:27,871
So the first one drops off from the second time you have a beta one and the third time also drops off.

625
01:33:28,951 --> 01:33:45,660
So as you can see that the slope corresponding to X1 is based on the interpretation of beta one does not involve two is.

626
01:33:45,661 --> 01:33:50,071
Similarly, the interpretation of beta two does not involve X1.

627
01:33:51,031 --> 01:34:02,501
Now what happens in the interaction model? So the model now is beta not black beta one, x1 plus beta two, x2 plus beta three.

628
01:34:02,521 --> 01:34:12,361
It's funny, that's the mean function. So again, the first order differential with respect to X1, what do you get now?

629
01:34:13,021 --> 01:34:17,431
So the first one drops off. Swanston From the second turn you get a better one.

630
01:34:19,501 --> 01:34:24,121
The third down drops off. There's no X1 there. What about the fourth term?

631
01:34:24,571 --> 01:34:29,220
The fourth term has an X1. So what if you take the derivative of B2C x1?

632
01:34:29,221 --> 01:34:34,291
It still exists with the X1. What do you get? You get a beta three x2.

633
01:34:35,611 --> 01:34:50,401
So the bottom line is now as you can see, that they think of x1 b means all x2 as well because the expression,

634
01:34:52,651 --> 01:35:00,751
the slope expression, quote unquote slope expression involves bitcoin plus beta three x2.

635
01:35:02,581 --> 01:35:07,021
It involves more than one coefficient and also the other four variants.

636
01:35:09,481 --> 01:35:16,951
So in an interaction model, the derivative of quote unquote the slope,

637
01:35:16,951 --> 01:35:24,541
and you can do the same thing with respect to x2 and you will get beat up two plus beta, three x1.

638
01:35:25,141 --> 01:35:32,941
So that aspect of X1 depends on the value of X2 and the effect of the x2 depends on the value of x1.

639
01:35:39,651 --> 01:35:42,971
Everybody fine from the media pick model.

640
01:35:43,011 --> 01:35:47,321
What is the main effect you thought you had as a leader?

641
01:35:48,111 --> 01:35:53,031
It's always coming up. Okay. So in the main effect model, what is the main effect?

642
01:35:53,421 --> 01:35:56,711
The main effect is rebellion.

643
01:35:56,751 --> 01:36:00,381
And it's equal to this slow.

644
01:36:03,511 --> 01:36:17,730
But in the interaction model, you know, the main effect barometers that I fall in define a beta one beta to the mean if it better me, do it.

645
01:36:17,731 --> 01:36:23,550
But there is also an interaction parameter and it turns out the main effect parameters in

646
01:36:23,551 --> 01:36:28,651
the interaction model like if I being down on the magnetic barometer corresponding to X1,

647
01:36:28,951 --> 01:36:38,041
that is not equal to the slope of the linear function of y with respect to x1.

648
01:36:39,871 --> 01:36:56,881
In fact, beta one is the change in the mean body, the meeting x1 when x2 is equal to zero or in other words, many would darn off this extract down.

649
01:36:57,271 --> 01:37:01,021
If you make it so equal to zero, then that these kids draw.

650
01:37:02,101 --> 01:37:09,480
And so the only way that you can interpret this main effect parameter in the interaction model is a slope.

651
01:37:09,481 --> 01:37:16,141
Is it is the change in the mean of y body meaning present x1 when it's two is equal to zero.

652
01:37:17,131 --> 01:37:26,821
But you know, depending on the nature of x2, this may be may not be interpretable, this may be of any less meaningless interpretation.

653
01:37:27,391 --> 01:37:39,901
So for the interaction model, we have a clear expression for the effect of X1 and that is beta one plus beta three x2.

654
01:37:40,711 --> 01:37:46,171
But beta one itself may have a very awkward interpretation.

655
01:37:46,171 --> 01:37:59,621
This is very, very important to realize. So we have a clear expression for the effect of X1 and that expression is beta one last beta three I do,

656
01:37:59,671 --> 01:38:12,181
which is showing that the effect of X1 on y depends on this double official with the one with the three and also depends on it to the other quality.

657
01:38:12,931 --> 01:38:21,571
But by itself the mean effect parameters in an interaction model beta one in return to me,

658
01:38:21,721 --> 01:38:30,181
not me have a very awkward interpretation of putting this is that you are switching making the other obedient zero.

659
01:38:31,681 --> 01:38:38,281
So the take home message from here is you have to be extremely careful when

660
01:38:38,281 --> 01:38:46,291
interpreting the questions for the mean effects in a model where there is interaction.

661
01:38:49,401 --> 01:38:58,791
And especially if the interaction is significant, then you really cannot be depressed by itself.

662
01:38:58,971 --> 01:39:05,301
The main effects it factors. This is a very important take home message.

663
01:39:06,831 --> 01:39:15,681
Really important to realize that. I'm just going to.

664
01:39:17,751 --> 01:39:26,181
So another way that you can write the interpretation is that you can write the exact same interaction model.

665
01:39:26,271 --> 01:39:39,621
Now in terms of you call it arms or responding to x1x2 and one way of writing, the effect of x one is you write the model is better not.

666
01:39:40,041 --> 01:39:49,071
Lastly, the terms are responding to the effect of x1, so beta one plus beat at three x2 time six one plus beta two x2.

667
01:39:49,671 --> 01:40:01,131
So the interpretation from this is what that x2 is held constant and the effect of x1 on on on the mean is given by beta oneplus beta three x2.

668
01:40:02,571 --> 01:40:06,741
Similarly, you can collect terms for the x2 effect,

669
01:40:07,071 --> 01:40:18,800
so which would be x2 and you can write it as beta not less beta two plus beta three excited time 6x7 times x.

670
01:40:18,801 --> 01:40:28,491
I do. So that's the effect of x2 on y and the part where it says x1 help can still be given by beta one except one.

671
01:40:30,321 --> 01:40:34,511
So so writing the same model just in two different ways to show the effect.

672
01:40:34,521 --> 01:40:36,621
And for the product number three,

673
01:40:37,131 --> 01:40:48,231
if you actually take the double derivative of the linear function y with respect to x1 x2, then you get beat up three.

674
01:40:48,321 --> 01:40:59,871
So beta please the mean changing x1 setback for developing using x2 or c another with the mean changing X to the effect for the unit increase in X1.

675
01:41:01,521 --> 01:41:14,060
Whether it's one effect is equal to the change in in the mean point, you need to increase in X1 with the X to help constant or vice versa.

676
01:41:14,061 --> 01:41:17,720
So basically I'm sort of resorting to this argument.

677
01:41:17,721 --> 01:41:30,601
So bottom line is the interaction term can be interpreted as the difference in the adjusted X1 reacts to affect for unit increase in the other movie.

678
01:41:31,701 --> 01:41:34,851
So that's the plot line. Okay.

679
01:41:35,181 --> 01:41:41,961
So I will stop here and we will pick up from here on Thursday.
