00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,631
Hi, so I'm here with Julia Adler Milstein.

2
00:00:03,631 --> 00:00:04,490
Welcome to.

3
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:05,306
>> Thank you.

4
00:00:05,306 --> 00:00:10,880
>> So in the lecture, that was really interesting perspective

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,578
about the ways that God help IT can affect quality,

6
00:00:15,578 --> 00:00:19,306
and what the evidence is actually said.

7
00:00:19,306 --> 00:00:24,251
And so we've seen a huge search, a lot of evidence is really before,

8
00:00:24,251 --> 00:00:28,702
there is national policy really encouraging adoption in IT.

9
00:00:28,702 --> 00:00:34,600
And we've seen a huge surge in authentic adoption and

10
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:43,264
hospitals and outpatient facilities.How could you kind of succeed in that?

11
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:48,202
>> Sure, so I think that the first issue is that, this is all pretty new.

12
00:00:48,202 --> 00:00:53,173
And that's why I don't think the evidence is is definitively clear on whether high

13
00:00:53,173 --> 00:00:55,596
tech has had the intended impact or not.

14
00:00:55,596 --> 00:01:00,271
Anf even if there are few studies that have been done comparing to the preimposed

15
00:01:00,271 --> 00:01:02,852
high tech in terms of quality outcomes and,

16
00:01:02,852 --> 00:01:05,666
they continue to just be really mixed, right?

17
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:10,287
Some studies that find generally positive effects on the mind no effects.

18
00:01:10,287 --> 00:01:15,255
So, I think we still have some time that we need to to sort everything out.

19
00:01:15,255 --> 00:01:15,789
>> Yeah.

20
00:01:15,789 --> 00:01:19,906
>> I think for me, the one concern is that what high tech did,

21
00:01:19,906 --> 00:01:23,703
is it really shone the spotlight on the DHR adoption.

22
00:01:23,703 --> 00:01:28,774
And if that was the end goal, as opposed to shining the spotlight on improved care,

23
00:01:28,774 --> 00:01:33,497
and then making clear the DHR adoption was a key tool that helped us get there.

24
00:01:33,497 --> 00:01:38,330
That's why I think that there is a big potential that the new adopters aren't

25
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:43,310
gonna see the same benefits as the early adopters, because their end goal was,

26
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:47,695
do we cheque the box and say we're now meaningful users, versus I think

27
00:01:47,695 --> 00:01:52,820
the earlier adopters who said, well, no, our end goal here is to improve care and

28
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:57,555
just really built DHR adoption into a broader target of improvement care.

29
00:01:57,555 --> 00:02:01,098
That's why I think that's gonna be a really interesting thing to track,

30
00:02:01,098 --> 00:02:04,865
is to see if we compare, I mean, it's hard as early adopters are different for

31
00:02:04,865 --> 00:02:06,653
a whole number of other reasons too.

32
00:02:06,653 --> 00:02:10,711
But I think that there is reason to think that any hospital that went into this with

33
00:02:10,711 --> 00:02:14,529
a goal, wanted to do this to get meaningful dollars, probably isn't going

34
00:02:14,529 --> 00:02:18,828
to improve quality dramatically because, there's so much more beyond just meeting

35
00:02:18,828 --> 00:02:22,315
meaningful use that you really have to do, in order to improve care.

36
00:02:22,315 --> 00:02:26,565
>> Well, I think that's a very interesting comment,

37
00:02:26,565 --> 00:02:30,730
particularly in the context of phase two, right?

38
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:33,492
Because meaningful use phase one,

39
00:02:33,492 --> 00:02:39,394
was really about to basically getting DHR, there's no question about it.

40
00:02:39,394 --> 00:02:43,874
Phase two, is really pushing the envelope further, and

41
00:02:43,874 --> 00:02:50,049
even with the delays probably faster than a lot of providers were able to do so.

42
00:02:50,049 --> 00:02:56,655
In some ways, I think policy was trying to get to where the DHRs are really moving

43
00:02:56,655 --> 00:03:03,473
towards improving care processes in a way that you should actually be reflected.

44
00:03:03,473 --> 00:03:10,778
And what we think about quality metrics and, that's in question now.

45
00:03:10,778 --> 00:03:14,445
But perhaps the system really wasn't early, so

46
00:03:14,445 --> 00:03:20,360
a good majority of the providers out there weren't ready for that at the time.

47
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,979
>> Yeah, so I mean, I agree with that.

48
00:03:21,979 --> 00:03:24,288
I think that there is a certain amount of time for

49
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:27,134
20 years prior just to be familiar with the technology.

50
00:03:27,134 --> 00:03:29,794
But I do think that even with stage two there is

51
00:03:29,794 --> 00:03:33,651
a persistent concern that you can do, you can meet the criteria.

52
00:03:33,651 --> 00:03:38,338
So, if we take for example the electronic exchange criteria, I think, first of all,

53
00:03:38,338 --> 00:03:42,405
even in stage two the threshold is only 10%, which is still pretty low.

54
00:03:42,405 --> 00:03:45,690
Are you really gonna transform care at 10%?

55
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:47,482
But I think the question is,

56
00:03:47,482 --> 00:03:51,154
do you know what quality outcome you want that to improve?

57
00:03:51,154 --> 00:03:53,291
Do you wanna reduce readmissions?

58
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:57,107
But if you're gonna reduce readmissions, you're gonna think about achieving that

59
00:03:57,107 --> 00:04:00,608
criteria in a different way, than if you just say our goal is just to do 10%.

60
00:04:00,608 --> 00:04:06,138
So, are you gonna focus that 10% on the patients that are high at highest risk for

61
00:04:06,138 --> 00:04:07,174
readmission?

62
00:04:07,174 --> 00:04:07,735
>> Yeah. >> And

63
00:04:07,735 --> 00:04:11,221
that's an example of how two organisations with a different orientation towards

64
00:04:11,221 --> 00:04:12,338
meeting meaningful use.

65
00:04:12,338 --> 00:04:14,485
One could see real improvement in an important outcome, and

66
00:04:14,485 --> 00:04:15,799
the other could see no improvement.

67
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:16,323
Right.

68
00:04:16,323 --> 00:04:19,532
>> Yeah, so you think about what policies is doing here.

69
00:04:19,532 --> 00:04:23,767
So, there's the ground up build the capacity of DHRs to be able to

70
00:04:23,767 --> 00:04:24,773
improve care.

71
00:04:24,773 --> 00:04:29,169
And then you have programmes that are incentivising outcomes with it which

72
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:32,858
are kind of agnostic to structure, or how you do it, right?

73
00:04:32,858 --> 00:04:37,642
And so, from your comment seems to suggest to me that,

74
00:04:37,642 --> 00:04:42,957
we should really be kind of saying, this is the care we want.

75
00:04:42,957 --> 00:04:48,785
We should be focusing on these, these are the outcomes we're looking for

76
00:04:48,785 --> 00:04:53,767
to provide some kind of any structure or support for adoption,

77
00:04:53,767 --> 00:04:58,467
but not think that just by like I'm gonna say optimising but

78
00:04:58,467 --> 00:05:02,321
by by speaking out everything we want DHRs to do,

79
00:05:02,321 --> 00:05:05,538
then that's gonna get to the outcomes.

80
00:05:05,538 --> 00:05:10,643
Maybe we just need the policy should be focused on getting to a basic level,

81
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:15,586
and then saying, now here's some assistance, but we can't get you all

82
00:05:15,586 --> 00:05:20,066
the way to where you need to be, just by telling you how to use DHR.

83
00:05:20,066 --> 00:05:20,662
>> Yeah. And

84
00:05:20,662 --> 00:05:24,589
I think a lot of the pushback against meaningful uses essentially grounded

85
00:05:24,589 --> 00:05:28,152
in that meaningful use, that incentive programme got its adoption.

86
00:05:28,152 --> 00:05:31,159
Now let's let the financial incentive programmes take over, and

87
00:05:31,159 --> 00:05:34,788
really let those be the driving factors and pull back a lot on meaningful use.

88
00:05:34,788 --> 00:05:38,197
And that's if you look at within macro, what's being proposed?

89
00:05:38,197 --> 00:05:43,256
I mean, it's essentially that right, under the merit incentive payment system,

90
00:05:43,256 --> 00:05:46,192
25% of the payment is tied to meaningful use.

91
00:05:46,192 --> 00:05:47,298
But the question is,

92
00:05:47,298 --> 00:05:51,490
could you just say that meaningful uses something much lighter than it is today?

93
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:53,318
>> Yeah. >> Why would you really need it,

94
00:05:53,318 --> 00:05:57,104
to be sort of these very specific criteria that say DHR, Hopefully not,

95
00:05:57,104 --> 00:05:59,608
if incentives are aligned, then I think you should be

96
00:05:59,608 --> 00:06:02,803
able to just hope that people will figure out how to use these tools.

97
00:06:02,803 --> 00:06:05,394
>> Right, if these are the measures that need to be met,

98
00:06:05,394 --> 00:06:06,783
we have incentives on that.

99
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:09,958
Why do we need incentives structure?

100
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:12,840
>> [INAUDIBLE] >> Exactly, right.

101
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:17,017
So, it seems it's not definitive, or

102
00:06:17,017 --> 00:06:23,102
perhaps it is that meaningful use is ending in 2016.

103
00:06:23,102 --> 00:06:24,835
>> So, it's not not definitive.

104
00:06:24,835 --> 00:06:29,534
So, I mean I think the backstory is that that the CMS administrator signalled that

105
00:06:29,534 --> 00:06:34,301
there was a lot of frustration with it, and that they were taking very seriously,

106
00:06:34,301 --> 00:06:36,952
they need to think about ending the programme.

107
00:06:36,952 --> 00:06:39,437
But if you look at statutorliy,

108
00:06:39,437 --> 00:06:44,603
I mean meaningful use has to be between 15 and 25% of payment.

109
00:06:44,603 --> 00:06:50,314
Unless they change the current meaningful use trajectory, we move on to stage three.

110
00:06:50,314 --> 00:06:53,932
And I mean that programme isn't scheduled to sunset, for several more years.

111
00:06:53,932 --> 00:06:57,081
So, they would actually have to make a legislative change,

112
00:06:57,081 --> 00:06:58,759
to make meaningful use go away.

113
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:01,711
>> So when you say between 15 to 20 %,

114
00:07:01,711 --> 00:07:04,387
that's under the, >> Yeah.

115
00:07:04,387 --> 00:07:06,670
And under the alternative payment models.

116
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:10,760
All that's required is that they have to use a certified DHR, so

117
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,032
meaningful use will not be part of,

118
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:17,763
at least according to the regulation, meaningful use is not part of APM.

119
00:07:17,763 --> 00:07:20,924
So, that should give accountable care organisations and

120
00:07:20,924 --> 00:07:25,178
these others more flexibility, to really figure out how to use DHR the way they

121
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:31,421
want they won't be bound by, >> I think there's one performance

122
00:07:31,421 --> 00:07:38,867
measures DHRs subject to do a job for adoption percentage.

123
00:07:38,867 --> 00:07:40,680
>> I suppose using a certified.

124
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,631
But I think at least by my reading of it,

125
00:07:42,631 --> 00:07:46,774
is not clear what are they gonna actually need to show, the whole reason meaningful

126
00:07:46,774 --> 00:07:50,825
use came about is because the question is how do if someone has a meaningful user?

127
00:07:50,825 --> 00:07:51,523
>> Yeah. >> So,

128
00:07:51,523 --> 00:07:55,114
I think they may even in in APM they may be back in the same problem of,

129
00:07:55,114 --> 00:07:59,032
well how do we actually know that they're adopting and using it and that.

130
00:07:59,032 --> 00:08:03,326
So, I think it still has to be specified and I'm sure it will not be as heavy as I

131
00:08:03,326 --> 00:08:06,250
mean, what it will actually be is an open question.
