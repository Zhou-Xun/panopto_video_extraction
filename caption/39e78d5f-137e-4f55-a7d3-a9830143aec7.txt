1
00:00:03,192 --> 00:00:05,518
Social Determinants of Health.

2
00:00:05,518 --> 00:00:09,888
Returning to the World Health
Organization's definition of health,

3
00:00:09,888 --> 00:00:13,454
reminds us that health is
the state of complete physical,

4
00:00:13,454 --> 00:00:17,925
mental and social well being, and
not merely, the absence of illness.

5
00:00:17,925 --> 00:00:22,368
Then who or what is responsible for
our health and mental health?

6
00:00:22,368 --> 00:00:27,344
These are complex questions, because data
consistently show that the death rate for

7
00:00:27,344 --> 00:00:30,248
African-Americans is higher than for
whites for

8
00:00:30,248 --> 00:00:32,685
10 out of 15 leading causes of death.

9
00:00:32,685 --> 00:00:37,675
While other populations of color have
higher rates of specific illnesses

10
00:00:37,675 --> 00:00:39,132
compared to whites.

11
00:00:39,132 --> 00:00:44,603
Nationally, there is a problem
with misclassification of Asians,

12
00:00:44,603 --> 00:00:49,899
Hispanics and American Indians
as whites on death certificates.

13
00:00:49,899 --> 00:00:55,480
Therefore, the baseline for health
disparity comparisons can be misleading if

14
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:01,316
we don't consider existing racial and
ethnic diversities and population health.

15
00:01:01,316 --> 00:01:06,390
Race is a critical social construct,
because it serves as a proxy

16
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:10,914
that has historically captured
economic exploitation,

17
00:01:10,914 --> 00:01:15,622
political marginalization,
and social stigmatization,

18
00:01:15,622 --> 00:01:19,423
which have consequences for
health and beyond.

19
00:01:19,423 --> 00:01:24,178
We must articulate the meaning of race
in social determinants of health work to

20
00:01:24,178 --> 00:01:29,079
reflect the lived experiences, polices,
and practices that have created deep

21
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:32,844
rooted barriers to good health for
different racial groups.

22
00:01:32,844 --> 00:01:36,588
If we examine a common childhood
condition like asthma,

23
00:01:36,588 --> 00:01:40,646
we find that both the incidence and
provenance for minority.

24
00:01:40,646 --> 00:01:44,621
And low income children
have increased over time.

25
00:01:44,621 --> 00:01:49,888
African-American children ages one
through five are twice as likely to be

26
00:01:49,888 --> 00:01:55,666
diagnosed and hospitalized with asthma,
than white children in this age group.

27
00:01:55,666 --> 00:02:00,518
Latino children from birth to 17 years
old visit the emergency department

28
00:02:00,518 --> 00:02:03,185
almost twice as often as white children.

29
00:02:03,185 --> 00:02:07,145
In addition, both Latino and
African-American children have

30
00:02:07,145 --> 00:02:10,958
a greater likelihood of going
to the emergency department for

31
00:02:10,958 --> 00:02:13,832
treatment due to asthma-related problems.

32
00:02:13,832 --> 00:02:17,940
Finally, the death rate due to asthma for
African-American

33
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:22,686
children compared to white children
is more than seven times greater.

34
00:02:22,686 --> 00:02:27,068
What is it about the lived experiences,
historical context and

35
00:02:27,068 --> 00:02:31,452
political realities of
African American and Latino children,

36
00:02:31,452 --> 00:02:36,986
that contribute to this poor health
outcomes for our common childhood disease.

37
00:02:36,986 --> 00:02:39,697
We now know where people live, work, and

38
00:02:39,697 --> 00:02:42,725
play are structural
determinants of health.

39
00:02:42,725 --> 00:02:46,373
Researchers have conducted
a tremendous amount of work

40
00:02:46,373 --> 00:02:51,351
to determine the influence of place on
health through examining ZIP codes.

41
00:02:51,351 --> 00:02:57,971
For example, people who live in
ZIP code 94301 in California,

42
00:02:57,971 --> 00:03:04,835
will live 14 years longer than
those who live in ZIP code 90002.

43
00:03:04,835 --> 00:03:08,686
Similarly, how long we live and
how well we live,

44
00:03:08,686 --> 00:03:12,183
depend on where we live
in the United States.

45
00:03:12,183 --> 00:03:17,476
The lowest life expectancy based
on zip code is in Bennett County,

46
00:03:17,476 --> 00:03:22,485
South Dakota, while county across
the nation have the highest

47
00:03:22,485 --> 00:03:26,947
life expectancy with range
from 67 to 81 years old.

48
00:03:26,947 --> 00:03:31,016
These figures serve as proxies for
the quality of life and

49
00:03:31,016 --> 00:03:36,630
access to environmental, economic and
social resources in these counties.

50
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:41,373
This does not mean that we cannot do
something to change these outcomes,

51
00:03:41,373 --> 00:03:45,976
especially when we consider non
medical pathways to improve health.

52
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:49,877
A social determinants of health
perspectives allows us to think about

53
00:03:49,877 --> 00:03:52,785
the influences of many
systems on population health

54
00:03:52,785 --> 00:03:54,780
other than the healthcare system.

55
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:58,836
Approaches to intervention
beyond personal behavior, and

56
00:03:58,836 --> 00:04:01,857
across economic and social opportunities,

57
00:04:01,857 --> 00:04:07,118
as well as equitable resource
distribution, are non-medical approaches.

58
00:04:07,118 --> 00:04:12,085
Policies to address living and working
conditions have broad implications for

59
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:17,137
improving health and mental health,
especially for vulnerable populations.

60
00:04:17,137 --> 00:04:21,383
This figure represent a common
illustration of multiple systems

61
00:04:21,383 --> 00:04:24,323
reflecting social determinants of health.

62
00:04:24,323 --> 00:04:28,431
Starting at the top of the diagram,
we see the neighborhoods and

63
00:04:28,431 --> 00:04:31,863
the built environment are points for
intervention.

64
00:04:31,863 --> 00:04:36,756
Continuing counterclockwise,
economic stability,

65
00:04:36,756 --> 00:04:42,173
followed by education, and
social and community contexts.

66
00:04:42,173 --> 00:04:46,242
Finally, we see,
there are continuous to be a role for

67
00:04:46,242 --> 00:04:49,615
the health care system
in improving health.

68
00:04:49,615 --> 00:04:53,338
Approaches to social
determinants of health consider,

69
00:04:53,338 --> 00:04:58,223
the population versus individual
determinants of health as a strategy for

70
00:04:58,223 --> 00:05:00,485
reaching large groups of people.

71
00:05:00,485 --> 00:05:04,585
Models of inequalities that include
multiple levels of influence

72
00:05:04,585 --> 00:05:05,837
are incorporated.

73
00:05:05,837 --> 00:05:11,851
In addition, how the environment affects
individual health outcomes are assessed.

74
00:05:11,851 --> 00:05:15,984
Therefore, multilevel frameworks
that include the social and

75
00:05:15,984 --> 00:05:20,273
environmental contexts with
influence on individual outcomes,

76
00:05:20,273 --> 00:05:24,189
that are unavoidable,
are appropriate in doing this work.

77
00:05:24,189 --> 00:05:31,039
Because they combine to create
disparities at the population level.

78
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:35,190
Don't forget the role of
the intersectionality of multiple social

79
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:37,459
identities that influence health.

80
00:05:37,459 --> 00:05:42,055
For example, what is it about
being an ethnic minority in

81
00:05:42,055 --> 00:05:46,855
the United States that could
lead to poor health outcomes?

82
00:05:46,855 --> 00:05:51,944
What about being an ethnic minority
with multiple social identities,

83
00:05:51,944 --> 00:05:54,502
such as an African-American man?

84
00:05:54,502 --> 00:05:59,777
What about being a poor woman?

85
00:05:59,777 --> 00:06:05,203
What about being homeless,
with a mental disorder?

86
00:06:05,203 --> 00:06:09,796
There are infinite combinations of social
identities that place people at risk for

87
00:06:09,796 --> 00:06:13,152
poor health outcomes due to
social determinants of health.

88
00:06:13,152 --> 00:06:17,704
As public health professionals, our job is
to recognize the significance of social

89
00:06:17,704 --> 00:06:21,915
determinants of health,
in achieving health equity for the nation.
