00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,850
Hello. Welcome to this lecture on

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:05,280
the Measure of Association
and Regression.

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,490
In this lecture, we'll discuss
the limitations of using

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:10,770
Pearson's correlation
coefficient R

5
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:13,050
as a measure of association.

6
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:16,080
Now, correlation is a
concept that we use not

7
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,450
only in public health
but in everyday life.

8
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:21,750
We might say that smoking is
correlated with lung cancer

9
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,805
or that drinking
high-sugar beverages

10
00:00:23,805 --> 00:00:25,995
is correlated with cavities.

11
00:00:25,995 --> 00:00:28,020
Now with correlation, we make

12
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:30,015
some assumption of
directionality.

13
00:00:30,015 --> 00:00:31,830
We would assume that
more smoking is

14
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:34,230
associated with more
risk of lung cancer,

15
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:36,510
whether drinking more
high-sugar beverages would be

16
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:39,345
associated with more
risk of cavities.

17
00:00:39,345 --> 00:00:41,700
However, with all quantities

18
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,850
is it valid to assume
that continually

19
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:46,655
increasing one of
them will always

20
00:00:46,655 --> 00:00:50,330
continually increase or
decrease the other quantity?

21
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:53,660
That is the question we will
discuss in this lecture.

22
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:55,460
Our learning objectives are to

23
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,170
realize the importance
of complementing

24
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:59,479
Pearson's correlation
coefficient R

25
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:01,910
with a scatter plot
of the actual data,

26
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:03,680
to then understand that
outliers can lead to

27
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,650
misleading estimates
of correlation and to

28
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:08,090
then understand how a Pearson's

29
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:09,800
correlation coefficient of

30
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,660
zero can occur with data

31
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:14,375
that actually do
have a correlation.

32
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:16,625
So we return to the scatter plot

33
00:01:16,625 --> 00:01:18,485
that I showed you in
a previous lecture.

34
00:01:18,485 --> 00:01:20,465
Looking at the
relationship between

35
00:01:20,465 --> 00:01:22,800
average percent of firearm
ownership in a state

36
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,100
and the number of male
firearm suicides for a

37
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,980
100,000 individuals
in each state.

38
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:29,660
In this scatter plot,

39
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:34,040
we had a correlation
coefficient of 0.84 indicating

40
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,890
a strong positive
association between

41
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:40,280
firearm ownership and
male firearm suicide.

42
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:44,375
Now I've highlighted in red
two of the states data.

43
00:01:44,375 --> 00:01:46,355
These two states have

44
00:01:46,355 --> 00:01:48,740
suicide rates that are
higher than all of

45
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:50,930
the other states and
therefore we say

46
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:53,590
that they are outlying
in their y-value.

47
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:55,380
Correspondingly, we can look at

48
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:58,010
the two states who have
the highest rate of

49
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:00,350
firearm ownership
and these two states

50
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:03,430
therefore we see our
outlying in the x -value.

51
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:06,800
You can see that one of
these points is outlying in

52
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,790
both the x-value and the
y-value which is possible.

53
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:13,295
Now, if I took these two states

54
00:02:13,295 --> 00:02:15,560
and imagined that Siegel
and Rothman collected

55
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,020
data that now look like
this scatter plot so that

56
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,490
these two states had

57
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:23,150
much lower suicide rates
than in the original data.

58
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,875
From these data, if we

59
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:27,290
computed a Pearson's
correlation coefficient,

60
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:30,500
that number would
be 0.48 indicating

61
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,970
weaker association than we

62
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:34,640
saw with the previous
scatter plot.

63
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,265
So we can see that
these two points have

64
00:02:37,265 --> 00:02:39,160
large impact on

65
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:43,040
the resulting correlation
coefficient that is computed.

66
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,870
As another example,

67
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,880
suppose these are the
data that Siegel and

68
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,740
Rothman collected and if

69
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,590
we computed a Pearson's
correlation coefficient,

70
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:52,640
we would get a value of 0.35

71
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,830
which suggests that there
is a modest amount of

72
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:57,365
association between
firearm ownership

73
00:02:57,365 --> 00:02:59,525
and the suicide
rate in the state.

74
00:02:59,525 --> 00:03:01,475
However, you can see immediately

75
00:03:01,475 --> 00:03:02,930
that there are two states

76
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:06,470
that are very distinct relative
to all of the other data.

77
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:08,090
These states are outlying in

78
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:11,930
both the x-value and the
y-value simultaneously.

79
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:15,290
If those two states
were not in the data,

80
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:18,215
you can see that the remaining
data suggests really

81
00:03:18,215 --> 00:03:20,720
no association between
firearm ownership

82
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,010
and the suicide rate.

83
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:24,440
It is just a random
scatter of points and

84
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,270
the actual Pearson's
correlation coefficient

85
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:28,285
would be something
very close to zero.

86
00:03:28,285 --> 00:03:30,365
It is 0.07.

87
00:03:30,365 --> 00:03:32,690
So you can see that a
preponderance of the data

88
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:35,150
suggest no association and it is

89
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:38,465
only two individual points
in the data that are driving

90
00:03:38,465 --> 00:03:40,100
any association that is

91
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:43,435
quantified by Pearson's
correlation coefficient.

92
00:03:43,435 --> 00:03:45,320
Again, a scatter plot would

93
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,510
immediately show us
that those two points

94
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:49,340
are concerning if we're going to

95
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:52,175
compute Pearson's
correlation coefficient.

96
00:03:52,175 --> 00:03:54,230
As the most extreme example,

97
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:55,700
suppose these are the data that

98
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,880
Siegel and Rothman had collected.

99
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,780
We see that the number of

100
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:03,380
male firearm suicides goes
up with firearm ownership.

101
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:05,230
It then hits a maximum point,

102
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:07,160
and then actually
the suicide rates go

103
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:10,385
down with further
firearm ownership.

104
00:04:10,385 --> 00:04:13,310
The Pearson's correlation
coefficient with

105
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:16,250
these data would only be 0.05.

106
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,305
Again, without the scatter plot,

107
00:04:18,305 --> 00:04:20,270
we would probably
have concluded that

108
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:22,520
firearm ownership and
suicide rates have

109
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,890
no association with
each other but we

110
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,930
can see a very distinct
pattern in these data.

111
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:30,170
Again, Pearson's correlation
does not pick up

112
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:32,840
this pattern because
it is a measure of how

113
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,800
all the points would fit
on a straight line and

114
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,340
it is obvious that these points

115
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:38,870
do not fit on a straight line,

116
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,550
they actually fit on a curve.

117
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:43,580
We call this a quadratic
association between

118
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:46,915
these two variables forming
the shape we call a Parabola.

119
00:04:46,915 --> 00:04:49,820
Again, Pearson's correlation
coefficient would be

120
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,425
inappropriate with these data

121
00:04:51,425 --> 00:04:54,125
once we saw the scatter plot.

122
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:56,360
So now throughout our discussions

123
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,890
of Pearson's correlation,

124
00:04:57,890 --> 00:04:59,585
we've had the concept
of there being

125
00:04:59,585 --> 00:05:02,255
a line that fits
through the data.

126
00:05:02,255 --> 00:05:04,955
We might wonder where
this line comes from?

127
00:05:04,955 --> 00:05:06,560
How did we decide which line is

128
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,000
best to draw among the points?

129
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,210
Then, does this
line actually have

130
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:13,910
any practical use for
us in public health?

131
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:15,200
The answer to these
questions will be

132
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,250
discussed in upcoming lectures.
