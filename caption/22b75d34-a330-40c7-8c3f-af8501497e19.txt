1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:09,470
Like microlensing or something like that.

2
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,560
This is a tangent, not exotic at all.

3
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:28,220
I don't like it when I have to make everyone feel passionately that, you know, like everyone knows what's going on.

4
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:35,320
Right. Sorry. I thought I made it pretty far.

5
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:43,110
And I promised myself. I tell. But I don't think I have.

6
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,669
I don't have any papers.

7
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:59,190
But I did, like, 10 minutes. We just need to move it later. She doesn't like it.

8
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:11,260
I like him personally. I think I like it.

9
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:19,070
I'll be there. Yes. He's like, Oh, she's been doing this for five years.

10
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:28,140
I'll let you know my father for one minute.

11
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:34,270
I know. I was like, I'll take it. I, you know.

12
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:54,780
Yeah. I think everyone everyone knows.

13
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:06,000
That's how it's turned out all around the country.

14
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:12,030
But I think that's it actually did come to me pretty soon.

15
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:16,470
I had won a distant third. We can get started already.

16
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:21,479
You guys, this is HP 606. I want you to check it.

17
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:26,310
Want to check your romance with us?

18
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:31,080
My name is Matt Costas class four times.

19
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:38,610
Okay, so it's it's if you like a count and you like it, if you don't like a county, you get in.

20
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,660
I am a CPA, CMA. Like I said, I've taught this class four times.

21
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:55,860
I currently I work as a controller for the UAW, Retiree Medical Benefits Trust.

22
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:02,270
We pay all the health care benefits.

23
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:13,960
I counted on. I got to give you that. Oh, we pay all the health care benefits for all the retired UAW employees for Chrysler and Ford.

24
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:21,780
I also work at Trinity Health Multi State Hospital System.

25
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:30,540
If you're located in an older age, like a line across the United States this way and then straight down the East Coast,

26
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:33,720
that's where all of their hospitals are and Mexican TI was.

27
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:38,640
But I was a director in their financial reporting department there.

28
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:44,100
I worked at K-Mart, North Kmart, still around, but I worked there for several years.

29
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:47,429
I worked in the FCC, which is the Securities and Exchange Commission.

30
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:54,540
That was I worked at. I did all the reporting for that, for a little fact.

31
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:59,530
I got interviewed by the FBI twice. I was fun.
