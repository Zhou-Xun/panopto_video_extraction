1
00:00:05,814 --> 00:00:09,704
So, again, I mentioned the remote recorder pilot. Yes.

2
00:00:09,714 --> 00:00:13,134
Because it looks like it's just capturing you, though.

3
00:00:13,134 --> 00:00:16,284
It's not capturing the the watch showing on the screen, is that right?

4
00:00:16,284 --> 00:00:20,904
Except what's on it is it's capturing everything. It just didn't give me a preview of it.

5
00:00:21,154 --> 00:00:29,124
No application. The reason I know is because this checkbox here says capture main screen.

6
00:00:30,414 --> 00:00:33,028
Okay, let me switch to the main screen. It hides it.

7
00:00:36,987 --> 00:00:47,097
This has our email address. And then also, I'll also share that out in my email after the session.

8
00:00:48,057 --> 00:00:52,017
Panopto capture. This is the tool that does the in-browser.

9
00:00:52,437 --> 00:01:02,487
So if I were, maybe my class is meeting in a different location, but I did want to capture what we're talking about.

10
00:01:04,797 --> 00:01:08,757
I can hit the create button and hit Panopto capture.

11
00:01:09,897 --> 00:01:16,047
So with that second option that's going to pop open a browser window, let's see if this really messes everything up.

12
00:01:20,377 --> 00:01:27,757
That's going to open this browser window where I get to pick my audio and video sources and if I want to share any screen.

13
00:01:28,867 --> 00:01:41,857
The most important thing when using Panopto capture is to hit allow on these prompts and let Chrome access your devices.

14
00:01:44,297 --> 00:01:48,317
I'm going to cancel out of that because I'm using a lot of devices as it is.
