00:00:05,266 --> 00:00:09,129
Qualitative study design,
designing a qualitative study.

2
00:00:09,129 --> 00:00:10,054
In this section,

3
00:00:10,054 --> 00:00:14,384
I will talk about what steps you need to
consider in designing your research study.

4
00:00:14,384 --> 00:00:18,386
Study design should be guided by your
research questions, so this is how

5
00:00:18,386 --> 00:00:23,570
you can get the information you need in
order to answer your research questions.

6
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:25,940
Some ideas for where to start.

7
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:28,720
A literature search on
your topic of interest

8
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,410
can help you refine your
research questions.

9
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:35,870
Here is where you can incorporate theory
and you may want to consider using

10
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:40,230
a conceptual framework to
guide your study design.

11
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:43,910
The next step in designing a qualitative
study is to determine who or

12
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:45,240
what you will study.

13
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:49,500
So first think, is your unit of
analysis going to focus on people, or

14
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,290
is it going to focus on structures,
like an organization?

15
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:55,340
And then second, think more narrowly and

16
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:59,530
decide are you going to focus on
the perspectives and experiences?

17
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:01,910
Are you going to focus geographically so

18
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:06,168
this could be focusing on a street,
a neighborhood, state or a country or

19
00:01:06,168 --> 00:01:11,395
are you going to focus on an activity such
as a certain event or series of events.

20
00:01:11,395 --> 00:01:15,805
Or are you going to focus
on a time based subject?

21
00:01:15,805 --> 00:01:18,975
So for example, this could be
done by focusing on a season,

22
00:01:18,975 --> 00:01:21,865
like a rainy season or
a dry season of a place.

23
00:01:21,865 --> 00:01:25,075
Or a political term of office.

24
00:01:25,075 --> 00:01:30,175
This will help you to establish your
inclusion criteria for a study sample and

25
00:01:30,175 --> 00:01:36,110
to help you to establish any exclusion
criteria you would need to consider.

26
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:38,871
You can also combine
multiple sampling frames,

27
00:01:38,871 --> 00:01:41,293
this could be different
groups of people or

28
00:01:41,293 --> 00:01:45,955
this could be a combination of people and
organizations as your unit of analyses.

29
00:01:45,955 --> 00:01:49,893
From the example I shared about our work
with women from central Asia working and

30
00:01:49,893 --> 00:01:50,850
living in Russia.

31
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:53,927
We chose for
our unit of analysis two groups of people.

32
00:01:53,927 --> 00:01:58,040
The first was healthcare and social
service providers in order to gain their

33
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:02,410
perspectives about the health needs of
women who come to Russia from central Asia

34
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:06,418
based on their experiences working with or
treating these populations.

35
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:09,448
The second group of people
was women themselves.

36
00:02:09,448 --> 00:02:13,492
So we set the inclusion criteria of
women who arrived in Russia from one of

37
00:02:13,492 --> 00:02:17,753
the central Asian countries at least
six months prior to being in the study.

38
00:02:17,753 --> 00:02:21,924
By including two groups of participants,
we were able to gain a more

39
00:02:21,924 --> 00:02:25,814
comprehensive understanding
about our research questions.

40
00:02:25,814 --> 00:02:29,266
There are some things one must
consider in selecting whom or

41
00:02:29,266 --> 00:02:31,831
what to include in
a research study design.

42
00:02:31,831 --> 00:02:35,181
You should think about possible
recruitment strategies,

43
00:02:35,181 --> 00:02:39,411
how you will find the people or access
the organizations you want to study.

44
00:02:39,411 --> 00:02:42,892
You should think about the feasibility
in conducting the research and

45
00:02:42,892 --> 00:02:48,020
the acceptability of conducting interviews
or observing behaviors or activities.

46
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:52,740
As you design your study and think about
who or what to focus on, it is crucial

47
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:56,940
that you consider the potential ethical
issues in conducting the research and

48
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:04,440
plan to ensure that your research study
design adheres to all ethical guidelines.

49
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:09,030
Next, you will need to decide how
you will collect the information.

50
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,990
This depends on many factors.

51
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:14,480
Here again we consider issues of
accessibility and feasibility.

52
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:19,360
We think about how appropriate it is
to collect the types of information

53
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,750
we want to collect.

54
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:24,830
A lot also depends on your expertise
as a public health researcher and or

55
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:27,840
the expertise of the data collection team.

56
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,070
Do you have the training needed to conduct
the interviews on your specific study?

57
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:33,890
Here you must also consider the time and

58
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:39,770
resources available to conduct
your proposed research project.

59
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:43,610
Here is when you begin to think about what
kinds of information you need and how you

60
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:49,210
will acquire this information in order to
help you answer your research questions.

61
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:52,800
For example, this could be developing
interview guide questions to ask your

62
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,900
participants in order for
you then to have the information

63
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:59,990
you need in order to answer
your research questions.

64
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:04,250
We will talk more in a later module about
various types of data collection methods

65
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:08,050
and what you should
consider in selecting them.

66
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:12,650
So in summary, your research questions
guide your study design, should consider

67
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:16,551
who or what you will need to include
in your sample in order to be able to

68
00:04:16,551 --> 00:04:20,851
capture the prospectives and experiences
central to your research questions and

69
00:04:20,851 --> 00:04:24,461
then determine the methods that you
need in order to get this information

70
00:04:24,461 --> 00:04:27,434
from your study population or sample.
