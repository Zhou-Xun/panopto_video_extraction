1
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:03,660
So just a reminder that next week you have a full draft of your proposal.

2
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:14,190
Do you have any questions about about that or about the peer reviews that you did or received?

3
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:26,569
One is poster session for Epic Studios. Is that next week? Okay.

4
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:30,280
Sorry. Yea. Yea, yea.

5
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:36,530
How many weeks of it. Okay.

6
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:41,300
Yeah. Oh, it's right where they said it was right before the break.

7
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,950
Okay. All right. I signed up to be a judge, so.

8
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:50,269
Yeah. Yeah, I'll be there. I just didn't remember one thing, so I think it's okay.

9
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:54,970
If it was next week, I was going to say I don't want you to turn in your paper, and I'm just.

10
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:06,970
Okay. Sorry, I forgot you all out. It's not necessary. Your paper is due next week.

11
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:10,240
A full draft poster is a ways away. Okay.

12
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:16,040
If you have questions about the final assignment, let me know.

13
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:21,760
I submitted grades for the first draft, but that's just like you turned it in or you didn't.

14
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,620
So don't interpret that score as anything about, like, your paper.

15
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:32,250
You should have gotten feedback from a peer.

16
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:38,890
If you're having trouble accessing it, you can reach out to me or your peer reviewer.

17
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:44,410
Yeah. Okay. All right. Let's talk about working school then.

18
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:55,330
Or school and work. All right.

19
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,900
That's supposed to build. So let's just pretend like it's not there. What?

20
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:03,540
Why would work affects your health.

21
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:20,240
The work context. Yes.

22
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:23,350
If you're spending eight plus hours doing.

23
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:35,860
Some kind of activity, whether it be sitting in. Okay.

24
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:39,780
So you spend a lot of your time at work. Many people do.

25
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:45,090
And there could be aspects of the physical nature of your work that have impacts on health.

26
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:55,480
Yeah, sure. Yeah. I think you're. Yeah.

27
00:03:55,490 --> 00:04:01,190
So there could be social aspects of your work that are good for your health or bad for your health.

28
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:04,610
So you could get social support there. You can have conflict.

29
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,050
There are other things about work.

30
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:14,630
Yeah. Patricia. Yeah.

31
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:21,100
You could be exposed to toxins, to chemicals, to noise, radiation,

32
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,910
all sorts of environmental exposures that you can have at work depending on the nature of your work.

33
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:35,100
The other aspects of work that can be good or bad for your health.

34
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:53,870
Okay. So there may be the extent to which you do or don't have control over your work could influence your.

35
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:04,799
Yeah. So your work can contribute solely to your income and the material resources that

36
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:10,950
you have that we know are important for helping some jobs provide housing for some.

37
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:19,770
Yeah. So you could get benefits through your work like health insurance or like here you have them, we have them healthy.

38
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:28,890
So you can get like you can get like diet and nutrition advice and you can take exercise classes and other things that are supposed to be promoting.

39
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:44,139
Let's see how many you got out of my list. So I had some things here on the left that were potentially health damaging.

40
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:52,870
So we talked about these physical demands. So that could be things like having to lift heavy stuff, right?

41
00:05:52,900 --> 00:06:01,750
Or like Jackie said, having to sit for a long time or stand for a long time job sometimes have physical demands that can impact health.

42
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:05,170
Also, like Patricia said, toxic exposures.

43
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:12,070
So you can be exposed to certain chemicals in your work or to radiation, and those things can have impacts on how.

44
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:17,260
There's also the psychological demands and control that Nikki mentioned in.

45
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:18,459
Sure. You mentioned. Right.

46
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:27,760
So so work comes with these psychological demands and either, you know, sort of a high enough control or a low amount of control over those demands,

47
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:34,900
which we'll talk more about in a minute about how that affects health. There's also this idea of effort, reward and.

48
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:40,870
So we talked a little bit about income and pay, that being the reward.

49
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:49,210
But work also involves effort. And so we'll talk about how an imbalance between effort and reward can impact how.

50
00:06:50,620 --> 00:07:04,630
Oh, this one didn't come up. So work, family, conflict, this is an aspect of work that we know can impact health, also nonstandard work schedules.

51
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:07,149
We'll talk more about this in detail in a minute.

52
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:17,580
But if you work the night shift or you have a rotating schedule, those kinds of things can have impacts on how those sleep through sleep disruption.

53
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:25,420
But there's also health promoting aspects of work which we've talked about a little bit, social engagement and support.

54
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:29,259
You do. Most people spend a lot of time at work,

55
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:36,530
and so this can be sort of the main place where you have social interactions and engagement outside of your family relationships.

56
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:48,579
Also role enhancement. So this can be something that like your work and your identity as someone in a particular profession,

57
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:54,160
can be really important to a person, to their sort of sense of identity.

58
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:04,900
Also, this can be something where it can be something that provides meaning to your life depending on the type of work that you do.

59
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:08,710
And that can be health promoting. We also talked about income.

60
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:14,420
It gives you income which we know can buy things that are important for health and which are said.

61
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:20,620
Health insurance oftentimes in the US comes through your work, so that's really important to you.

62
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:29,110
So I sort of grayed out the ones here that we're not going to go into detail about, but they are important,

63
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:32,740
so we're not going to really talk about physical demands or toxic exposures,

64
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:36,760
but we're going to talk about all of these other potentially damaging aspects.

65
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:41,860
Job strain, effort, reward and balance. Work, family conflict and nonstandard work schedules.

66
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:45,340
I think this probably doesn't come as a surprise to you,

67
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:54,399
but there's much more research in social epidemiology on the health damaging aspects of work rather than the health promoting aspects of work.

68
00:08:54,400 --> 00:09:05,260
And that gets back to sort of something we were talking about a few weeks ago with the sort of emphasis on disease and pathology in the discipline.

69
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:09,470
But certainly there are health promoting aspects of work that could be studied.

70
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:14,950
So we will talk a little bit about social support in relation to job strain as we go through.

71
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:21,580
All right. So I'm going to start by talking about the demand control model.

72
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:32,050
So this model was developed by Karasick and it has two dimensions.

73
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:37,990
So the first dimension is decision latitude, and the second is psychological demands.

74
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:46,840
And I'll talk a little bit about what those things mean. So decision latitude is related to the concept of alienated labor.

75
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:51,970
It involves the employees control over the use of her skills.

76
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:59,650
So that's like your skill utilization and the employee's control over decision making relevant to her work tasks.

77
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:09,820
So then that's authority over decisions. Then there's also psychological demands.

78
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:20,800
So that can include qualitative emotional demands, like an upset customer or an upset patient.

79
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:30,070
And then quantitative demands also. So things like the number of performances per unit of time.

80
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:43,420
So decision latitude is about sort of how much control you have and then psychological demands

81
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:49,000
or about both those qualitative emotional demands and quantitative demands on your time.

82
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:57,009
So then there are sort of four combinations here that Koracick described,

83
00:10:57,010 --> 00:11:05,920
and the first one is a high demand, low control job, and he described that as a high strain job.

84
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:12,640
So can you think of any example of this kind of job?

85
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,770
Have you ever had one of these kinds of jobs or know anybody who has?

86
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:39,979
Andrew. You see. Yeah. Have you have one of these. So you have like a schedule that's very rigid, no control over that.

87
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:47,150
A lot of demands. What kind of can anybody think of, like a type of job that might fit into that category?

88
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:53,670
Yes. There. Yeah.

89
00:11:55,740 --> 00:12:00,180
Like. And nurse.

90
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:07,970
Yeah. And then there's that.

91
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:24,970
Yeah, that nursing can fit in there because there are a lot of demands, but maybe less control than some other positions within like health care.

92
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:31,430
Alan, did you bring it up? Yeah. Yeah, I know. There's.

93
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:38,540
Uh. Hi. Mm. Oh, yeah.

94
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:47,620
Mm hmm. And then. And she's you know, her whole life is upside down.

95
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:54,040
Yeah. Yeah. I think that's because she has to go to work.

96
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:58,270
Yeah. And then, you know, then work in the.

97
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:04,330
The. You know, it's like.

98
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:06,890
Yeah. Yeah.

99
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:18,120
So maybe if you're on an assembly line there, there's high demand because you're expected to do a certain number of units of work per amount of time.

100
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:23,220
Right? So it's like coming in quickly and you really have very little control over that.

101
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:32,059
You know, you can think about like Amazon warehouse workers, you know,

102
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:39,750
so they they're they're literally being timed how long it takes them to go pull the product and get it ready for shipping.

103
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:48,920
So very high demand and slow control. Did any of you ever work in, like a fast food restaurant or something like that when you were?

104
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:56,870
Yeah. So that's another example of like there's a lot of demands, but there's very little control over what you do and how you do it.

105
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:07,340
So then you can also have high demands, but high control, and this is described as an active job.

106
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:12,890
And can you think of an example of a job that high demand, but also high control?

107
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:22,740
Yeah. We have, like, a small business. Okay, so maybe you have a small business and there's a lot of demands for running that business,

108
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:27,360
but you also have a lot of control over when you work and how you do it and that sort of thing.

109
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:34,290
Yeah. Okay. So you could imagine professors might have a lot of demands,

110
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:40,900
but also have a lot of control in terms of when they work and what they work on and things like that.

111
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:48,480
Yeah. What about in the health care setting?

112
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,010
We think nurses kind of go into high demand, low control.

113
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:56,160
Is there anybody in the health care setting that might be more in high demand and high control?

114
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:04,380
Yeah. Well, it like. Okay.

115
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:11,780
But. Yeah.

116
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:18,280
So hospital administrators might be in here relative to nurses, doctors might be more involved.

117
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:25,159
But the higher control little bit, you're right that there is doctors will actually talk a lot about how they have

118
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:30,920
limited control because they have to see patients in a very short amount of time.

119
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:39,770
They have to do a lot of documentation and paperwork kinds of things that they feel like limit their control over their work.

120
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:50,610
Yeah. So then you can also have low demands and low control.

121
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:54,030
So this would be a passive kind of job.

122
00:15:56,010 --> 00:16:03,240
These are harder to think of, but can you think of something that would be both low demand and low control?

123
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:25,370
Yeah. Yeah, that's yeah, that's a good one.

124
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:31,969
So like working and gosh, especially right now if you go to the mall like no one's there, right?

125
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:36,350
So if you work in a store that's like that's really not busy,

126
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:44,120
then that could be relatively low demand because there's not a lot of customers there, but also low control.

127
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:52,590
I think of also like a a night guard at a bank.

128
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:59,520
Right. Like you have no control. You have to just sit there. But there's not much going on.

129
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:03,360
Right. So that's that's a passive kind of job.

130
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:08,640
And then you can have low demands and high control.

131
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,470
So a low strain job. Can you think of any example of that one?

132
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:23,069
Yeah. Caitlyn Jenner. Yeah.

133
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:28,490
So it could be like a business owner could fall under this one, especially if,

134
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:37,530
let's say it's a relative or it's like a medium sized company and you have like a staff rate that you can delegate things to.

135
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:41,129
And so maybe you don't have a lot of demand because you're not you know,

136
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:46,770
you're not doing as much of the work anymore, but you have a lot of control over the direction of your company.

137
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:51,820
Yeah, exactly. Know, like something like that.

138
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,910
Just have a good look at. Yeah.

139
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:01,050
Do you think that's is that this one or is that this?

140
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:05,100
Do they have control? I don't understand. I do not understand that point.

141
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:08,820
I have tried to learn about it. Do any of you understand it?

142
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:15,840
Anyone understand that point? No, I don't understand it.

143
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:21,690
Like one time The New York Times did this big article one time that was like explaining what it is.

144
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:31,680
I read the whole thing. I promise I did. I got bored. But I like I think I tried so hard and I just was like, I don't I don't get it anyway.

145
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:36,569
So maybe the queen of readers fall under here.

146
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:43,460
I don't know if. I don't know what they do. Yeah, sure. Yeah. Yeah, maybe like an artist.

147
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:49,590
So you don't really have a lot of demands coming from, like, your boss.

148
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:53,240
Right. Um, but you do have a lot of control.

149
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:58,300
You may still have. You may still feel high internal demands, right.

150
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:08,819
To do something. But the external demands are. So the chapter that you radfords today as social epidemiologist falls in here.

151
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:12,450
But I don't agree with Colin. I don't think that social epidemiologist falls in here.

152
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:23,879
I think it's so parasitic hypothesized that low strain jobs would be the best for health, while high strain jobs would be the most toxic.

153
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:30,060
So the best kind of job you can have is low demand, high control, and the worst is high demand, low control.

154
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:40,170
He argued that what matters for health is the balance between demands and control, not just the amount of demands a person faces at work.

155
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:51,510
So kind of a long time ago, there was this idea that, you know, the most stressful kind of job is like being a CEO,

156
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:58,890
somebody who had really high demands that that was sort of the worst kind of job for your health.

157
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:08,040
And then the more people like studied this and studied kind of workplaces and most of the early work in this was through the Whitehall study.

158
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:14,760
So like one of the papers that you read for today was from the Whitehall studies of British civil servants.

159
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:22,440
They started to understand that really as long as you had a lot of control over the work that you did,

160
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:26,250
then having high demands wasn't necessarily bad for your health.

161
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:29,370
So the ideas about this changed a lot over time.

162
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:44,639
So research on job strain and health has shown that higher levels of job strain are associated with increased coronary heart disease,

163
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,150
hypertension and mental disorder, but not cancer.

164
00:20:51,950 --> 00:21:01,760
There's mixed evidence for health behaviors, and then the effects of job strain appear to be small when compared to other risk factors.

165
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:10,140
So it is associated with health, but relative to some other risk factors like smoking, right?

166
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:15,700
It's a relatively small. So.

167
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:24,860
You know, people, social epidemiologists who study stressors,

168
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:33,799
job strain is kind of one of the big stressors that social epidemiologists have focused on in research, that in social isolation.

169
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:38,000
Those are kind of the two biggest stressors that social biologists have focused on.

170
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:49,430
So another model that was proposed to think about sort of the effects of work on health was the ISO strain model,

171
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:58,340
and this was proposed by Johnson and Hall. And it sort of builds on the demand control model, adding social support.

172
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:08,110
So what are some examples of support that you might get at work?

173
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:18,480
Yeah, sort of. Yeah.

174
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:25,280
So you might get support from your coworkers. Yes.

175
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:31,310
Okay. So you might get parental leave as part of your work.

176
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:34,360
That is support like a supportive policy.

177
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:42,970
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

178
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:48,280
You could get support from your boss, like they could serve as a mentor to you, that sort of thing.

179
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:55,880
You know, oftentimes people develop friendships at work, and so you might spend time outside of work with your colleagues.

180
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:05,120
So so this can also kind of support can feed into the demand control model.

181
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:12,740
So what this ISO strain model says is that you have that high strain type of job.

182
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:22,250
Remember, high demands, low control, and if you add social isolation on to that, then you get what they call a toxic job.

183
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:30,800
So this would be like even more health damaging to have not only high demands and low control, but also social isolation.

184
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:39,950
So can you think of a kind of job where this might be characteristic of that type of job?

185
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:54,730
Yeah. Yeah.

186
00:23:54,740 --> 00:24:01,340
So you could have something where you have like a lot of hours, you have to be on call, that sort of thing.

187
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:04,520
And maybe you're working alone work.

188
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:16,950
Yeah. Yeah. No, I don't think about, like, like a bridal store where I wouldn't help each other because, like, that just wasn't the culture.

189
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:20,719
So it would be like really high stress, you know?

190
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:25,850
It's like, it's like really expensive items that people get obviously very intense when they're wedding.

191
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:30,190
Yes, I can imagine brides are challenging to work with.

192
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:36,079
And then you're and then if you're if you're in competition with your coworkers and therefore you're not supporting each other,

193
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:46,370
it could make it worse. Yeah. Yeah.

194
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:51,529
So you could definitely have a job where it's very unclear what you're supposed to do.

195
00:24:51,530 --> 00:25:03,140
And that could be that could be really stressful. I think also, you know, when they when they did this model, there was not very much remote work.

196
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:12,200
Right. But you can imagine how there could be more of this now because of working from home.

197
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:19,070
Right. So you could have social isolation as a result of sort of doing your job from home.

198
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:25,990
But having I'm thinking about, you know, there's a lot of telehealth now.

199
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:34,700
So I did an appointment with a nurse practitioner and she's like sitting in her living room and she's just being patient after patient after patient.

200
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:43,580
Right. Just sitting there by herself. So you could imagine that that could be potentially, um, a high strain kind of job.

201
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:49,700
Um, you know, you can also think about, I think about delivery drivers.

202
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:54,620
This has become like so much more common now that we order things online.

203
00:25:54,620 --> 00:26:01,429
So people who are driving U.P.S. trucks or FedEx trucks or Amazon delivery, they have like really high demands.

204
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:06,830
They have to deliver a large number of packages in a small amount of time. And they're doing the work kind of by themselves.

205
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:19,090
Oh, I wanted to bring up something related to this.

206
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:28,700
So, Sara, you mentioned in your post that the U.S. surgeon general just put out a report on toxic workplaces.

207
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:32,420
Can you tell us a little about that? I should be able to.

208
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:40,180
But you know. And not actually.

209
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:55,170
That trying to figure out what? Seems to be across different industries.

210
00:26:55,170 --> 00:27:00,070
And then. Workplace.

211
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:08,850
Yeah, it was three pages. And basically it's like, here's where we are.

212
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:16,440
I didn't. And you heard her say. And also see.

213
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:24,210
I'm curious as to how much. I'm sorry.

214
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:25,890
No, it's fine. I just.

215
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:34,799
I thought it was interesting that that there was this report on toxic workplaces, and I was curious how they defined toxic workplaces.

216
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:38,970
I think you it'd be interesting to see if it fits with these definitions from the

217
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:43,260
social epidemiology literature or if they're defining it in kind of a different way.

218
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:48,569
Um, yeah, yeah, yeah. Um, so I'll let you do that.

219
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:58,320
And then I also wanted to talk about this, this other thing that you mentioned and also Mikhaila mentioned in response to it.

220
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,070
So you were talking about the show, the fear.

221
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:07,020
I have heard of it, but I have not seen it. Do you want to describe?

222
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:10,590
So you were talking about a character named Sidney. Thank you for taking my.

223
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:18,980
It was like what I was reading. So, yeah, things like a comedy drama show.

224
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:31,950
Eight episodes. This guy, the main character by his older brother, commits suicide.

225
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:38,220
And so he goes home to Chicago to run his life. And so.

226
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:45,730
During the show, the interplay of the main character harmony is like strangers to everybody now.

227
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:54,919
But he's trying to build a more healthy workplace. But you have people that are just like an older, white, cisgender male.

228
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,920
He's like very toxic masculinity.

229
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:08,350
And then you have a number of other characters who are like characters of color, but for people of color, for actors that don't have as much control.

230
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:13,630
And then Cindy Crawford, black women. And she is like.

231
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:20,040
So she's trying to implement a healthier workplace. You don't need to.

232
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:25,370
That is super toxic. That person has to report to the.

233
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:30,910
There's a whole episode that's going be devoted to her struggling with that.

234
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:36,910
If we have this toxic structure. How can we expect?

235
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:49,000
Collaborative and. But also I didn't realize it.

236
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:58,260
But that was something that was coming to my. If someone is experienced as a person.

237
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:04,070
A gender minority. Yeah.

238
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:11,399
Like how do social identities also come in here with the high street and the social isolation?

239
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:16,740
So, McKayla, you are also mentioning this. Do you want to say more about that?

240
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:23,120
Um, so there you also have like the positive heart that everybody loves and it.

241
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:27,580
It's like a black and white. Highlighting.

242
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:33,970
She's using like a butcher knife to. For all the life for the island.

243
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:40,240
It's very poetic just talking about how that picture was revealing.

244
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:45,310
Like you're preparing to go to a toxic environment.

245
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:53,650
And I felt like I really related to that image because I feel like the knife was a symbol of many different things.

246
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:57,290
One of the things was like the highlighter in the making.

247
00:30:57,310 --> 00:31:08,680
This like kind of a symbol of covering up. Maybe big parts of herself that are not socially accepted in places where they're not white spaces, etc.

248
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:13,750
And so I just really felt like that was a great piece that you can really relate to.

249
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:23,340
And I just feel like a lot of other things happen, like having to hide parts of yourself that are always just widely accepted.

250
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:28,840
And I think that's all of that over time just grows.

251
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:39,940
Yeah. So you can have not only the sort of stressful nature of the job related to the demands and the control, you can also have the social isolation.

252
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:48,720
You can have this other aspect of social identity and how that relates to all of us.

253
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:53,220
And perhaps that's an additional sort of source of stress in there.

254
00:31:53,370 --> 00:32:07,050
Yeah. So then the other model that they talk about in the chapter is this effort, reward and balance model.

255
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,540
And this was developed by Siegrist.

256
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:17,040
And it says that the health consequences of work depend on the degree to which workers are rewarded for their efforts.

257
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:24,420
So saying it's not just about demands and control, but how much are you rewarded for the effort that you put in?

258
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:36,560
And so effort is the individual's response to extrinsic or intrinsic demands.

259
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,490
So the angry bride, right.

260
00:32:46,050 --> 00:32:51,240
And then the rewards are the financial and non-financial benefits that you get from work.

261
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:56,700
So what are some examples of benefits that you might get from work?

262
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:02,410
There's the obvious one, right? Money.

263
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,079
But what else? Yeah. Patricia. Okay.

264
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,860
You can have pride in your work. That can be a benefit that you get.

265
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:20,800
Yeah. Okay. You could develop social capital from, like, relationships that, you know, with people at work.

266
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:29,260
Yeah, it kind of makes me think of, like, doing that or like developing this professional network that can promote your success.

267
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:34,930
Other things that you might get from work that are benefits.

268
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:53,310
You might get a promotion, right? The financial rewards, health insurance and these other benefits, you may get bonuses, other financial rewards.

269
00:33:54,330 --> 00:34:03,240
And so according to this model, you can achieve a healthy state when increased effort leads to increased reward.

270
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:14,500
And that what's what's problematic is when putting forth effort doesn't produce rewards in response.

271
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:29,980
Do you feel like in your experiences, if you've had a job before, did you feel like your effort was adequately rewarded?

272
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:38,090
No. How did you feel at your job with the bridal store?

273
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:44,450
Did you feel like the harder that you worked, the more sales you made, the more money you made sometimes.

274
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:52,739
Anybody ever had a different experience where you felt like you were working really hard and

275
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:58,920
you weren't being paid well or not getting respect or other kinds of benefits that were.

276
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:04,620
Yeah. Patricia. Yeah, I was. Yeah.

277
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:13,950
Yeah. So waitressing is a great example.

278
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:22,920
You might work really, really hard, you're dependent on tips, and then people don't don't give you the tip that you were expecting or hoping for.

279
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:27,479
Right. And then you're also paid like a really low wage on top of that.

280
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:40,770
And you depend on those tips. Yeah. So the thing to keep in mind here is that you can achieve a healthy state.

281
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:49,380
If your efforts and your increased efforts aren't leading to increase rewards, you can also achieve a healthier state by decreasing your effort.

282
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:56,330
Right. Have you heard about by quitting? It's like all in the news now, right?

283
00:35:56,370 --> 00:36:02,130
So people are kind of pulling back on their or at least, you know,

284
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:11,340
there's this idea out there that people are pulling back on their work effort because they don't feel as invested or like work is very rewarding.

285
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:18,999
And so that is another way that you can, I guess, in theory, achieve a balance between effort and rewards.

286
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,700
But of course, that's always a little risky to reduce effort.

287
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:34,820
So in terms of effort, reward and how, again, this has been associated with cardiovascular outcomes in numerous studies.

288
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:47,060
Somebody asked a question about why cardiovascular or cardiovascular stops or cardiovascular outcomes are very like stress sensitive.

289
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:51,770
So there is a common outcome that people look at when studying stress.

290
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:58,090
So in the Whitehall study that I mentioned before about the British civil servant,

291
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:07,030
control and effort reward imbalance both contributed independently to coronary heart disease events.

292
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:16,390
So it's suggesting that control and effort reward imbalance are sort of separate dimensions of work that impact health.

293
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:33,910
So they're both important. So another aspect of work that can have impacts on people's health in the area of work, family conflict.

294
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:41,050
So that's when you have incompatibility and the role pressures from the work and family domains.

295
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:46,660
So you can have a situation where your family demands interfere with your work demands.

296
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:56,710
So the example I put here is that you wake up and your child has a fever or you're supposed to be at work, and now what do you do?

297
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:58,570
You can't send your kids to school.

298
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:05,340
And so you have this sort of conflict between what you need to do to take care of your child and what you need to do.

299
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:14,710
What's being expected of you from work? You can also have a situation where your work demands interfere with your family demands.

300
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:25,379
So I put email here so you can imagine that if you're getting a lot of requests outside of office hours through email and

301
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:31,530
you're supposed to be having dinner with your family or giving your kid a bath or whatever you're supposed to be doing,

302
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:36,840
that these work demands can kind of get in the way and interfere with family demands.

303
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:54,010
So this kind of goes both ways. Some people have been talking about how remote work during the pandemic has potentially reduced some of these demands,

304
00:38:54,020 --> 00:39:02,389
like there was a report that just came out that was looking at birth rates during the pandemic,

305
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:08,600
and there was an expectation that birth rates would fall because there was a recession.

306
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:13,640
And typically birth rates fall during a recession, but birth rate rates went up.

307
00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:27,800
And the hypothesis is that more women felt like working from home would allow them to meet family demands while also continuing to work.

308
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:31,379
And so, you know, of course, that's a hypothesis.

309
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:36,570
That's right. They're just looking at population patterns and trying to understand what might be driving it.

310
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:44,810
But, you know, could you imagine that it might also go the other way with remote work?

311
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:51,230
Jared, you're nodding your head. Do you think that remote work can increase work family conflicts?

312
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:14,880
Yeah, it could be it could be hard. It could potentially be harder to create separation between work and home life if you're working from home.

313
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:25,030
I think it also probably depends on if you're a parent for each of the kids right away and how much how many demands there are.

314
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:33,459
I think we did see that when kids when school aged that is needed to do remote school.

315
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:39,400
But that created a lot of a lot of conflict and demands for working parents.

316
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:50,570
So we talked about this last time that there have been significant changes over time in female labor force participation.

317
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:58,219
So this in line as women aged 25 to 54 years, and this goes from 1948 to 2016.

318
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:03,230
So you can see that this is the group that has had the big increase in labor force participation.

319
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:18,230
And so this can potentially lead to increased work, family conflict because you have more parents who are working also.

320
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:22,130
We talked about this when last time changes in family structure.

321
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,650
So we have more single mothers today than in the past.

322
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:33,500
And single mothers are more likely to work for pay than married or partnered mothers.

323
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:39,500
So there's more of a potential here for work, family conflict.

324
00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:49,950
And then this is some data about reported work, family conflict, cross-national comparisons.

325
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:55,380
So the light gray bar on top is the amount of work family conflict that men report.

326
00:41:55,650 --> 00:42:00,650
And then below that is the amount that women report in a bunch of different countries.

327
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:05,070
So, you know, further over here, as further to the right is more work, family conflict.

328
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:09,240
And I'll just I'll read the list of countries to you because I'm sure you can see that.

329
00:42:10,290 --> 00:42:14,670
So it starts with. So the highest work, family conflict there.

330
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:19,709
Then Mexico, Slovak. Poland, Israel, Philippines.

331
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:22,920
Spain, Russia, Portugal. Cyprus, Hungary.

332
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:26,970
Australia. USA, Latvia. Czech Republic.

333
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:33,160
KS Will. Genia. Flanders. Flanders a country.

334
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:38,620
Or is that a region? I don't know.

335
00:42:39,010 --> 00:42:42,850
Flanders, France, Sweden, Finland, Netherlands, Germany.

336
00:42:42,850 --> 00:42:47,020
Norway and Denmark. And Japan. And Switzerland with the least.

337
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:53,040
Are you surprised by this ranking? Someone says no.

338
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:56,729
Jackie says no. Okay. Yeah.

339
00:42:56,730 --> 00:43:03,150
So this country looked ah, this study looked at gender differences in work, family conflict in 27 countries.

340
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:12,750
You can see that almost always the darker bar is further out, meaning that women are reporting more work family conflict than men.

341
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:17,220
Which isn't terribly surprising given the things that we've talked about in the past before,

342
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:23,820
with women having continued expectations for primary responsibility for childcare and housework.

343
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:34,170
Women and men in the U.S. report higher levels of work family conflict than those who live in other high income countries like the U.K.,

344
00:43:34,170 --> 00:43:44,160
France and Germany. And so I'm sure you know this, but the U.S. has very limited policies that sort of support families.

345
00:43:45,330 --> 00:43:52,110
So we do have some so we have the Family and Medical Leave Act, although that act is fairly recent.

346
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:54,510
That was passed in the 1990s.

347
00:43:56,010 --> 00:44:05,130
And importantly, the Family and Medical Leave Act only applies to businesses that have at least 50 employees, so not two smaller companies.

348
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:15,060
And there's no pay. Right. So you can take leave, but it's unpaid, so your job will be protected, but you don't have money.

349
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:18,570
And so for a lot of people, that's not especially helpful.

350
00:44:20,370 --> 00:44:30,630
We also have the childcare tax credit so you can get a credit on your taxes when you pay for for childcare, for daycare and that sort of thing.

351
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:38,670
But we lag behind many other high income countries in implementing family friendly economic policies.

352
00:44:40,290 --> 00:44:47,180
There was a proposal for. Sort of.

353
00:44:47,630 --> 00:44:50,720
I can't remember what it was. Do you guys remember?

354
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:53,960
It was it was recent. It was like it was a Biden proposal.

355
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:58,639
It wasn't for. Was it for three year olds? Preschool.

356
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:02,480
Universal preschool. That ring any bells? I don't know.

357
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:10,129
It didn't pass, but there was sort of an attempt to provide some more family friendly policies.

358
00:45:10,130 --> 00:45:20,330
But there was not support for that. Um, so in terms of work, family, conflict and health, having higher levels of work,

359
00:45:20,330 --> 00:45:28,070
family conflict is associated with increased risk of stress related mental and physical health outcomes and increased health risk behavior.

360
00:45:32,490 --> 00:45:38,700
And it may have what's called crossover effects on kids, either directly or indirectly.

361
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:47,070
So directly might be through the transmission of maternal stress hormones to the fetus during pregnancy indirectly.

362
00:45:47,790 --> 00:45:53,730
That kind of work family conflict can shape the quality of parent child interactions, which can impact kids health.

363
00:46:07,490 --> 00:46:16,220
So nonstandard work schedules is another kind of component of work that can be good or bad for how?

364
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:25,499
So some examples of nonstandard work schedules include things like moonlighting.

365
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:34,000
So having a second job. Do you think having a second job would be good for your health or bad for your health?

366
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:41,510
There is a bad. Most of you look like you're saying that.

367
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:50,120
Any good thing about having a second job? Yeah.

368
00:46:55,330 --> 00:47:00,800
Yeah. So it might give you some more economic stability. If you lost one job, you would have another.

369
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:03,910
Of course you would make more money if you had multiple jobs.

370
00:47:03,910 --> 00:47:06,530
And this can have health benefits.

371
00:47:06,910 --> 00:47:17,290
But the drawback, of course, is that, you know, you have no time for other health promoting things like sleeping, eating.

372
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:25,730
Relaxation. Right. And this could also potentially increase work, family conflict.

373
00:47:26,670 --> 00:47:31,040
If you have multiple jobs, because it would be hard to sort of meet family demands.

374
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:38,360
If you're if you're working that many hours, you could also be working the night shift or rotating shift.

375
00:47:38,390 --> 00:47:43,220
We've talked about this a little bit. This can disrupt your daily routine.

376
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:52,520
This can be related to social isolation, which we know is bad for people's health.

377
00:47:53,090 --> 00:47:56,280
It can lead to suppression of melatonin secretion.

378
00:47:56,300 --> 00:48:00,860
It can really disrupt, like your sort of circadian rhythms and your sleep.

379
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:14,889
And we know that this is actually really bad for health. So then another type of nonstandard work schedule would be involuntary part time work.

380
00:48:14,890 --> 00:48:20,140
So this would be where you want full time employment, but you aren't able to get full time employment,

381
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:33,730
so you're only able to work part time or temporary work where you get a job, but it's not sort of guaranteed or permanent.

382
00:48:33,730 --> 00:48:39,010
You're there to do like a six week contract or something, and then you have to find another position after that.

383
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:54,430
Contracting this is increasingly common in our economy to have this kind of work and even even when you have permanent work,

384
00:48:54,940 --> 00:49:01,659
there's still a lot of, um, there's a lot of layoffs, right?

385
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:10,450
So industries kind of hire and then they have too many people and then they lay people off.

386
00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:20,120
And this like we get these cycles in the economy where work is sort of tenuous in ways that is, that can be really stressful.

387
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:27,550
Right? Um, these kinds of jobs oftentimes lag benefits too.

388
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:32,560
So if you are doing part time work or you're a contractor or a temporary employee,

389
00:49:32,890 --> 00:49:36,340
you likely don't have health insurance or other benefits through that.

390
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:42,309
So these are kind of unstable types of jobs, flexible schedules.

391
00:49:42,310 --> 00:49:51,820
So these are becoming more standard, I think for some types of employees, um, particularly for like people in the knowledge economy.

392
00:49:52,750 --> 00:49:57,640
So do you think that flexible schedules would be good for health or bad for healthcare?

393
00:49:58,090 --> 00:50:17,360
Who knows? I just.

394
00:50:18,740 --> 00:50:30,000
Yeah. So if you have a flexible work, it could lead you to have a sort of an irregular schedule which can be bad for business or not for,

395
00:50:30,310 --> 00:50:33,810
you know, you don't have regular packages and things like that.

396
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:40,549
Yeah. What else about flexible schedules?

397
00:50:40,550 --> 00:50:55,420
Could be good or bad? Might give you a little more control over your work when you work, how you do it.

398
00:50:57,310 --> 00:51:02,290
Although now you may have seen this, there's a lot of companies that for their remote workers,

399
00:51:02,290 --> 00:51:13,840
they install software on their computers that track the movement of their keyboard in their mouth to make sure that people really are working right.

400
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:18,450
So it may not actually give you more control.

401
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:23,200
It kind of depends on that. On the job. Um, yeah.

402
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:28,750
I mean, it could potentially, like we talked about, reduce work family conflicts, which would be good.

403
00:51:29,170 --> 00:51:32,709
Um, it could reduce sleep and leisure, which could be bad.

404
00:51:32,710 --> 00:51:38,540
So I think that flexible schedules are one that are automatically good for how they're automatically bad for health.

405
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:44,860
That probably depends on the circumstances of the job and other conditions like family responsibilities and things.

406
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:54,969
So overall, thinking about nonstandard work schedules and how they impact how we know that shift work is associated with increased heart attack,

407
00:51:54,970 --> 00:52:02,500
stroke and cancer and probably not through a stress mechanism, but probably through the effects on sleep disruption.

408
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:12,940
So I think that's like a very clear research finding is that any, any type of nonstandard work schedule that disrupts it's really bad for health.

409
00:52:19,130 --> 00:52:24,230
So in terms of the future of work, you know,

410
00:52:24,230 --> 00:52:35,300
there's these kind of big forces that have been going on for a while and are now changing in even more dramatic ways because of the pandemic.

411
00:52:35,750 --> 00:52:41,000
But we have globalization, outsourcing, increasing financial competition.

412
00:52:42,470 --> 00:52:50,390
And so this can put greater demands on workers to produce more with limited resources and time.

413
00:52:51,050 --> 00:52:57,230
We also have this has resulted in the decline of labor unions and the power of labor unions.

414
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:06,400
And so that has had an impact on work.

415
00:53:07,390 --> 00:53:12,370
We've had technological innovations that have changed the nature of work.

416
00:53:12,370 --> 00:53:23,770
So you can work from home in a lot of types of jobs, but you can't get away from work, which has some, you know, kind of negative implications.

417
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:28,060
Your knowledge and skills can become very quickly outdated.

418
00:53:29,110 --> 00:53:32,550
Yeah. Yeah.

419
00:53:54,480 --> 00:54:01,980
Yeah. So the company was probably trying to increase efficiency, to increase labor cost,

420
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:08,790
but maintaining the same level of productivity and incentive and the technological innovation that leads to fewer jobs.

421
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:19,640
Yeah, so there's definitely that. I mean, even so in factories, but also this is happening in other ways too.

422
00:54:19,650 --> 00:54:28,470
So it hasn't fully happened yet. Right. But Amazon wants to deliver things with drones instead of drivers.

423
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:34,680
I know like for me, I started using calendar bleed.

424
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:46,380
So instead of my assistant keeping my schedule, like I can just I have this, you know, technological tool that manages the calendar.

425
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:56,700
And so even like those kinds of administrative support, jobs can be affected by it, by kind of technological innovations like that, too.

426
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:03,750
So yeah, this is how the technology thing is, is impacting work in a lot of ways.

427
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:09,630
Um, we don't like the only time we're saying we don't need as many workers in manufacturing.

428
00:55:10,350 --> 00:55:13,499
We're seeing big changes in retail with e-commerce.

429
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:17,910
That's why you go to the mall. Nobody's there because everybody buys their stuff online.

430
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:26,130
Um, another thing that's happening that will sort of impact the future of work is an aging workforce.

431
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:32,010
So particularly like the baby boomers, kind of the youngest baby boomers are entering retirement.

432
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:35,819
Now that's changing work a lot.

433
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:39,570
So people are living longer. There's fewer pension plans.

434
00:55:42,590 --> 00:55:46,670
People may not be able to retire at the kind of traditional age.

435
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:51,290
But then we also saw that COVID really impacted these trends.

436
00:55:51,290 --> 00:55:56,330
Right. A lot of people left the workforce earlier than they might have otherwise.

437
00:55:56,900 --> 00:56:00,740
And it remains to be seen whether they will come back into the workforce.

438
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:09,190
But there's kind of a lot of changes that are happening right now in the workforce that could ultimately have implications for for population health.

439
00:56:14,410 --> 00:56:17,420
So I want to talk just a little bit about school.

440
00:56:17,650 --> 00:56:29,170
Also, there's much, much, much less research on the effects of school, on how we can think about school as like work for kids.

441
00:56:29,170 --> 00:56:35,700
Right. So you spend a lot of time there, right?

442
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:37,150
You have social interaction.

443
00:56:37,510 --> 00:56:46,330
So I put up the same list that I had earlier for Why Would Work Affect Health, and now I'm just replacing it with why would school affect health?

444
00:56:46,690 --> 00:56:54,910
And so if you look at the potentially health damaging aspects of school, I think of all the things that apply to work also apply in school.

445
00:56:55,840 --> 00:57:01,030
So kids could have physical demands that impact their health related to school.

446
00:57:01,930 --> 00:57:09,549
There can be toxic exposures, psychological demands and control, effort, reward and balance,

447
00:57:09,550 --> 00:57:19,940
work, family conflict, nonstandard schedules, and then that potentially health promoting ones.

448
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:24,400
Of course, kids don't get income or health insurance from school,

449
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:29,080
but education and their educational attainment will be really important for

450
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:33,610
their future income and ability to have health insurance and things like that.

451
00:57:33,610 --> 00:57:39,129
Right. I added a future or a couple of things here.

452
00:57:39,130 --> 00:57:43,210
So I added the future income and employment kind of replacing the years,

453
00:57:43,780 --> 00:57:54,370
but also one that doesn't apply so much to work and a place to school is the idea of government programs that can be potentially health promoting,

454
00:57:54,370 --> 00:58:00,040
right? Because schools are organized by funded by the government.

455
00:58:00,370 --> 00:58:04,120
And so you have this opportunity for health promoting things that happen here.

456
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:11,050
So can you think of some examples of government programs that are located within schools that might be health promoting for kids?

457
00:58:25,950 --> 00:58:34,419
Yeah. Yeah.

458
00:58:34,420 --> 00:58:41,350
So definitely a free and reduced lunch program can be really important for health.

459
00:58:41,740 --> 00:58:45,850
That was one of the things that people worried about a lot at the start of the pandemic was that a lot

460
00:58:45,850 --> 00:58:50,770
of kids got breakfast and lunch at school and then they weren't gonna have access to that anymore.

461
00:58:50,770 --> 00:58:52,540
And so I know, like any entrepreneur,

462
00:58:54,070 --> 00:59:01,450
they were still preparing the food and sending it out into different neighborhoods in Ann Arbor for people to pick up those meals.

463
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:06,980
Um, yeah, I call them, uh, I know this one.

464
00:59:10,570 --> 00:59:18,310
Uh huh. Yeah. That one. Try to. The prices are.

465
00:59:19,510 --> 00:59:34,690
I don't know. But. Yeah. Prevention, though I know the benefit is there for.

466
00:59:38,050 --> 00:59:39,420
Oh, okay. Yeah.

467
00:59:39,430 --> 00:59:49,270
So you might have some kind of intervention aimed at substance substances that you can implement within schools that could be health promoting.

468
00:59:49,870 --> 00:59:56,120
You also have physical education programs in school that could potentially be help promoting and other things.

469
00:59:56,120 --> 01:00:03,160
So. So this is kind of you could implement, um, health promoting interventions within the workplace,

470
01:00:03,490 --> 01:00:11,920
but not as universally as what you could do with in schools just because of the nature of how schools are funded.

471
01:00:16,950 --> 01:00:27,479
So let's take a break, come back at 1040 and then we are going to watch a documentary about some I now it's really I love

472
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:32,820
this documentary about early childhood education programs and the long term implications on health.

473
01:00:32,820 --> 01:00:38,100
So you read the paper about the Abecedarian Project.

474
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:42,900
We're going to see about that and about some other ones. So come back at 1040 and we'll start that.

475
01:01:01,140 --> 01:01:12,120
You know, I. So I'm feeling.

476
01:01:18,990 --> 01:01:30,230
Here is 21 year old.

477
01:01:36,430 --> 01:01:45,960
Uh huh. I know, but I thought.

478
01:01:46,140 --> 01:01:51,150
I actually have to go give a presentation to the Dean's advisory board.

479
01:01:51,330 --> 01:01:56,460
Yeah, that's why I don't have office hours. Oh, I see. But let me see if we could.

480
01:01:57,840 --> 01:02:08,579
Yeah, I mean, it's really. No, no, I have to agree with on Tuesdays, you know,

481
01:02:08,580 --> 01:02:14,100
I have a few minutes to eat lunch and then I have to walk to the union and then I have to do it anyway.

482
01:02:14,130 --> 01:02:24,780
Okay. Okay. So Monday, do you have time Monday afternoon between three and five because it's not going to take me that long to do that thing.

483
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:28,650
Yes. Oh yeah. Is three okay.

484
01:02:28,830 --> 01:02:32,620
Yes. Okay. So you virtual. Yeah, I'm fine.

485
01:02:33,530 --> 01:02:37,590
Thank you so much for being here. It's glad that I wasn't too late to the couch.

486
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:42,000
No, no, it's okay if that's.

487
01:02:51,000 --> 01:03:09,340
3 p.m. I just feel I of.

488
01:03:10,790 --> 01:03:20,040
So it was. And.

489
01:03:20,690 --> 01:03:24,420
Okay, all right. I did it for 15 minutes, but if we need to be longer than that.

490
01:03:24,460 --> 01:03:28,940
Right. Okay. Thank you. You're welcome. Yeah.

491
01:03:31,220 --> 01:03:41,580
Oh, yeah. Oh, sorry, I forgot to do that. Oh, you are obviously low and I'm in my like obviously at this point.

492
01:03:41,820 --> 01:03:45,630
But it seems like they're saying that us literally.

493
01:03:48,060 --> 01:03:52,469
Yeah, but I don't like toxic themselves.

494
01:03:52,470 --> 01:04:11,450
It was more like say. So I think it's very important that we're seeing a lot of use of the software and the incredible business.

495
01:04:13,260 --> 01:04:22,220
So yeah, I think they really did surround it, but they didn't.

496
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:29,960
Yeah. And like, how would you measure like how would you do research on it?

497
01:04:31,020 --> 01:04:38,130
Do you have this like, you know, these are like, oh, I'm gathering at this point.

498
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:46,770
Was more of like this is something that we're going to share so that employers know how they can create a better workplace.

499
01:04:46,980 --> 01:04:52,660
Yeah, it's almost more quality, though. Oh. You know what I would like to know?

500
01:04:52,860 --> 01:04:59,900
I mean, I think you're probably right, but it doesn't seem like there's thing that this is having.

501
01:05:00,820 --> 01:05:05,130
It was actually kind of like they go into each other with a wider view.

502
01:05:05,340 --> 01:05:17,000
Yeah. But in terms of like the next thing is that they have like this is like here that they say this is what happened.

503
01:05:17,370 --> 01:05:22,690
But I like a lot of auditing issues.

504
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:27,050
It's like, okay.

505
01:05:28,350 --> 01:05:31,850
Yeah. Yeah.

506
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:39,390
So I think it was a given. It's the first company. That's what I mean, that you're like, oh, I was.

507
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:46,710
I was just. Yeah. You've the topic of the speaker, so thank you for bringing it up.

508
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:53,670
That's why I never had you read like an article.

509
01:05:55,020 --> 01:05:59,700
Full disclosure, I thought previously the economy disintegrated because, like you.

510
01:06:00,660 --> 01:06:06,570
In a way it was, but I dug it and actually went to the work itself.

511
01:06:06,740 --> 01:06:09,959
Yeah. Yes, I think it's the same story here.

512
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:16,310
But the original version, they're not exactly right in terms of I don't know the details.

513
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:22,190
So I really feel like I can see it in other countries just so I.

514
01:06:23,230 --> 01:06:28,810
The Labor Bureau does a want to hear from the Department of Labor.

515
01:06:31,740 --> 01:06:42,910
Like it's coming out of nowhere. Everything you know about.

516
01:06:49,470 --> 01:07:06,680
Taylor. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

517
01:07:20,070 --> 01:07:51,590
Wasn't. I don't know.

518
01:08:01,510 --> 01:08:06,200
If that happens, it's going to.

519
01:09:40,100 --> 01:39:10,160
Oh, sorry. Yeah, that's about that.

520
01:39:12,740 --> 01:39:16,790
What's that? I don't know.

521
01:39:17,150 --> 01:39:24,110
Why don't you sit down? Moving to your mother over here is moving in.

522
01:39:24,130 --> 01:39:33,500
I thought they weren't having kids there. So what does Canada have that makes you want to move there?

523
01:39:34,660 --> 01:39:45,070
I didn't know. Okay, so health care, investing in kids, you have to be a.

524
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:55,209
I think what you're. I just.

525
01:39:55,210 --> 01:40:02,770
I can't. So having parental leave is appealing to 75% of men.

526
01:40:02,770 --> 01:40:06,720
Okay. Compared to six weeks on leave?

527
01:40:08,220 --> 01:40:23,220
Yeah. Better, for instance. So.

528
01:40:27,500 --> 01:40:35,229
Really scared of that. I mean, it's cool.

529
01:40:35,230 --> 01:40:39,420
Yeah, I guess. Mm hmm.

530
01:40:41,500 --> 01:40:45,940
Other things that anybody over here want to move to Canada.

531
01:40:49,840 --> 01:40:55,120
So why don't we do these things? Why doesn't the U.S. have these programs?

532
01:41:09,040 --> 01:41:16,549
That is a challenge, right? That this kind of investment, you tend not to see benefits for a long time.

533
01:41:16,550 --> 01:41:22,900
And so it is a long term investment. And why might that be hard in our system, do you think?

534
01:41:33,950 --> 01:41:38,899
Well, people tend to hold elected office for very limited amounts of time.

535
01:41:38,900 --> 01:41:46,460
Right. And so you want to enact policies that have a short term return or a short term benefit.

536
01:41:47,660 --> 01:41:51,050
And so that is a challenge. Did you want to say something about that?

537
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:58,940
I'm wondering. Yeah, I think you. So that.

538
01:41:59,180 --> 01:42:05,160
Mm hmm. I feel like it's similar to, like, change your diet.

539
01:42:07,510 --> 01:42:11,940
Got to do that because in the real world, the returns, the benefit.

540
01:42:13,110 --> 01:42:18,629
Yeah, it's hard even at the individual level to do something that doesn't have immediate returns.

541
01:42:18,630 --> 01:42:22,500
Right. Like it is more challenging to see the then.

542
01:42:24,810 --> 01:42:27,030
I mean, I do think one of the things they mentioned,

543
01:42:27,030 --> 01:42:34,770
I don't think this would be the case in the U.S. because we already have such high labor force participation rates among women.

544
01:42:35,340 --> 01:42:39,749
But they were noting that at least in the seventies, when they implemented these programs in Quebec,

545
01:42:39,750 --> 01:42:46,500
that they saw such a large increase in female labor force participation that it increased taxes in a way that offset the cost.

546
01:42:46,530 --> 01:42:50,370
So that was like sort of a short term benefit that they saw.

547
01:42:50,370 --> 01:42:58,800
But I think in the US context you would be unlikely to see that because we already have such high rates of labor force participation among mothers.

548
01:43:00,540 --> 01:43:04,739
But so so that's there's like a political reality, I think,

549
01:43:04,740 --> 01:43:09,570
that makes some of these things challenging related to the fact that it's a it's a

550
01:43:10,110 --> 01:43:14,069
it's a long term investment rather than something that would have short term benefit.

551
01:43:14,070 --> 01:43:19,170
Are there other reasons why this might not be politically palatable in the US context?

552
01:43:27,440 --> 01:43:39,270
Yeah. McKayla. So I don't like.

553
01:43:43,990 --> 01:43:51,570
I. I feel like that's silly because we.

554
01:43:52,590 --> 01:44:04,540
I. And the rent to that looks like it might feel threatening and inequality.

555
01:44:04,730 --> 01:44:14,470
Yeah. Yeah. But people might want their children to have wealthier people might want their children and society.

556
01:44:28,470 --> 01:44:39,680
Yeah. The other groups who might benefit the most.

557
01:44:41,240 --> 01:44:44,300
Of course, all of society is benefiting is their appointment, right?

558
01:44:44,450 --> 01:44:49,490
But the most immediate benefit would be to groups of people who have less political power.

559
01:44:50,420 --> 01:44:54,020
And so maybe politicians aren't as interested in that. Yes.

560
01:44:55,250 --> 01:45:00,860
I think we also have to some extent, sort of an ideological position that.

561
01:45:02,720 --> 01:45:08,240
You're responsible for yourself. You're responsible for yourself, and you're responsible for your own kids.

562
01:45:09,080 --> 01:45:20,780
And that we have sort of like a little bit of an anti-government sort of ideology within the US that maybe other countries don't share as much.

563
01:45:20,780 --> 01:45:28,420
And there's less of an interest in things that benefit people collectively rather than individually.

564
01:45:28,430 --> 01:45:36,460
So some of it is this kind of idea of rugged individualism, which is is part of American culture.

565
01:45:36,470 --> 01:45:44,510
So you can see how that might be might be more challenging to kind of to have that happen within the US context.

566
01:45:47,790 --> 01:45:58,590
What do you think some of the kind of mechanisms are that help explain why these childhood education programs would have an impact on adult health?

567
01:45:59,070 --> 01:46:05,520
Like why does why do these preschool projects or preschool programs seem to have impacts on health long term?

568
01:46:05,550 --> 01:46:16,420
Do you think? Yeah.

569
01:46:21,370 --> 01:46:35,679
Okay. You know, it's like you. Yeah.

570
01:46:35,680 --> 01:46:42,260
So it could be that that these these programs are kind of contributing to human capital formation.

571
01:46:42,290 --> 01:46:49,359
Like, you have better quality education. You probably complete more education long term than that, of course,

572
01:46:49,360 --> 01:46:56,170
has implications for your income and occupation and all these other things that we know are important for health.

573
01:46:57,130 --> 01:47:05,050
Are there other kind of mechanisms that they might operate through besides just sort of increasing educational attainment and economic benefits?

574
01:47:07,170 --> 01:47:15,170
Yeah. Patricia. Yeah.

575
01:47:15,180 --> 01:47:19,410
And you can see by watching them that they need it right there. Spencer.

576
01:47:19,830 --> 01:47:26,069
Cats are kind of weird, and it can be very helpful for them to be in this kind of, like,

577
01:47:26,070 --> 01:47:32,610
social environment where they're learning about norms and, like, and experiencing social interaction.

578
01:47:32,610 --> 01:47:36,120
And, yes, that social component is important. Yeah.

579
01:47:48,560 --> 01:47:50,690
Yeah. You know, like, preschool can be fun.

580
01:47:50,900 --> 01:47:58,940
So you associate school with fun, and you feel more engaged and motivated, and you're more ready once you get into the less fun stuff.

581
01:47:58,940 --> 01:48:03,469
Or you can be kind of self reinforcing, like you're doing well in school.

582
01:48:03,470 --> 01:48:07,110
So you like school, so you do well in school, that kind of thing.

583
01:48:07,130 --> 01:48:13,190
Yeah. You also talked about how you were the one who said delayed gratification.

584
01:48:13,950 --> 01:48:16,519
Like, that's some of what they're talking about in here.

585
01:48:16,520 --> 01:48:24,079
Is it kind of these programs can help affect people's time horizon in a way that helps with delayed gratification,

586
01:48:24,080 --> 01:48:28,740
which has many benefits for your health and economic benefits or whatever.

587
01:48:28,760 --> 01:48:32,040
So there's multiple ways in which. Oh, yes. They're going to be here.

588
01:48:33,090 --> 01:48:41,500
Yeah. Going to try and.

589
01:48:51,320 --> 01:48:58,670
Yeah, absolutely. So it can reduce stress for parents in a lot of ways, which then can then promote healthier home environments for kids.

590
01:48:58,670 --> 01:49:01,549
And so it's not just what's happening within the school context,

591
01:49:01,550 --> 01:49:06,410
but it's influencing the family sort of environment and context on these other ways, too.

592
01:49:06,440 --> 01:49:11,160
Yeah, I mean, that was my second question is how might this affect the health of parents, too?

593
01:49:11,180 --> 01:49:23,750
Right. You know, like so you see in this example that, um, it allows some, some of the people who was a little kid that his mom's name was Isabel.

594
01:49:24,800 --> 01:49:29,210
He's my favorite. Vladimir is hilarious.

595
01:49:30,200 --> 01:49:33,560
I'd love to see him now. Like, I'm sure he's still hilarious.

596
01:49:35,420 --> 01:49:40,340
So his mom can go to school, right? Because they have this affordable child care.

597
01:49:40,340 --> 01:49:43,610
So there's these ways in which it improves and benefits parents.

598
01:49:43,610 --> 01:49:47,719
And that's why everybody on this side of the room wants to move to Canada, because they're thinking,

599
01:49:47,720 --> 01:49:54,860
not only would this be great if I had kids, it's great for me, you know, like I'd be healthier and potentially happier.

600
01:49:55,250 --> 01:49:59,060
So, yeah, definitely. These things can can impact the health of parents, too.

601
01:49:59,480 --> 01:50:05,330
So then a question comes up like about the best way to apply these interventions.

602
01:50:05,600 --> 01:50:12,350
So I think we're seeing discussions about this now in the U.S. Is it better to apply

603
01:50:12,350 --> 01:50:17,720
these types of interventions universally or to groups that are considered high risk?

604
01:50:18,650 --> 01:50:22,730
So in Canada it seems like they took the universal approach.

605
01:50:23,540 --> 01:50:31,520
In the US we tend to take more of a high risk approach with like income limits and or,

606
01:50:31,550 --> 01:50:34,970
you know, income tests and things like that to qualify for programs.

607
01:50:35,420 --> 01:50:39,770
What do you think? What do you think is better?

608
01:50:45,910 --> 01:50:55,880
Yeah. You're. So like the children that are looking.

609
01:51:01,480 --> 01:51:05,320
Targeting those groups for early education programing is best.

610
01:51:05,680 --> 01:51:09,710
However, when it comes to. What's her role here?

611
01:51:10,040 --> 01:51:14,149
I think that. Yeah.

612
01:51:14,150 --> 01:51:18,800
So it might depend on the particular policy that you're thinking about.

613
01:51:19,280 --> 01:51:26,720
Do you think there is implications politically for whether you do one versus the other?

614
01:51:27,170 --> 01:51:53,700
Cynthia, you're nodding your head. Why do you think so? Yeah.

615
01:51:55,820 --> 01:52:02,600
So do you think politically it's better to go with Universal rather than target it or Target rather than right?

616
01:52:02,960 --> 01:52:18,080
I think, yeah, it's definitely more. Yeah.

617
01:52:18,460 --> 01:52:27,040
So the argument is that you may get more support for universal the kinds of benefits I mean, we've seen that with like Social Security or aid.

618
01:52:27,050 --> 01:52:31,020
It's kind of it's not entirely universal, but generally universal.

619
01:52:31,320 --> 01:52:37,889
And that has had tremendous support because people with higher incomes benefit from it, as well as people with lower incomes.

620
01:52:37,890 --> 01:52:47,000
They're. Give it.

621
01:52:51,710 --> 01:53:00,770
Right? Yeah. And it just was incredible.

622
01:53:01,830 --> 01:53:09,600
But now that people have it, they know that it works really well. So I guess you could.

623
01:53:12,030 --> 01:53:19,050
Yeah. It's really hard to. I think that's the trick.

624
01:53:19,070 --> 01:53:25,280
If like one term for maintaining it, the universal ones are probably better,

625
01:53:25,500 --> 01:53:30,530
but for getting them passed, the targeted ones seem to be easier because they're cheaper.

626
01:53:31,310 --> 01:53:34,960
But then they don't get as much support long term.

627
01:53:34,970 --> 01:53:38,300
So it is like that's a really that's a tricky one.

628
01:53:39,170 --> 01:53:42,290
And yeah, if you tell people you're going to because you do have to pay for them.

629
01:53:42,290 --> 01:53:47,780
Right. You know, it's one thing to say over the course of this child's life, it will pay off $1,000,000.

630
01:53:48,050 --> 01:53:50,580
It's like, well, do you have $1,000,000 right now?

631
01:53:50,600 --> 01:53:55,550
Because we have to pay the teacher and the daycare center and buy insurance and all that kind of stuff.

632
01:53:56,000 --> 01:54:05,690
So that's always tricky. It's like you either have to raise taxes or you have to move money from something else to that.

633
01:54:05,690 --> 01:54:09,970
And so in the video around, the economists was talking about that, right?

634
01:54:09,980 --> 01:54:17,120
Like there's a strong there's a lot of momentum around the status quo because there's there's groups and

635
01:54:17,120 --> 01:54:22,279
individuals who are benefiting from the way that money and things and resources are distributed right now.

636
01:54:22,280 --> 01:54:31,010
And if you want to redistribute them, even temporarily, it feels like taking something away from someone, which is always hard to the.

637
01:54:34,820 --> 01:54:40,530
I was like Jeff Bezos. You can get the stuff in there.

638
01:54:41,520 --> 01:54:47,650
Yeah. So he does say that. Yeah. He's like that. The money is we have the money distribution that is.

639
01:54:49,840 --> 01:54:56,950
Yeah. Yeah. You know, what's this space Twitter guy, Elon Musk, right?

640
01:54:56,980 --> 01:55:05,350
He used 33 billion of his own money to buy Twitter like today or yesterday or whenever it might be.

641
01:55:06,230 --> 01:55:10,070
Like only. There are other things.

642
01:55:12,640 --> 01:55:17,050
Yeah. That's another thing I don't understand. Like Bitcoin, I totally don't understand Twitter.

643
01:55:17,060 --> 01:55:22,740
Like, I just don't I don't get it. I, I try and I try to understand why.

644
01:55:22,780 --> 01:55:28,330
I kind of understand why people look at it, but I don't understand how it makes money.

645
01:55:28,350 --> 01:55:32,049
Getting it doesn't make money. Right. It doesn't make money.

646
01:55:32,050 --> 01:55:36,270
It doesn't. I think it loses money.

647
01:55:38,060 --> 01:55:41,130
Oh, yeah. And supposedly advertising.

648
01:55:41,250 --> 01:55:47,610
But I don't know. I don't like whatever. It's beside the point, but. Yes, but the point is, there is a lot of money.

649
01:55:48,330 --> 01:55:52,070
But who has it and what do we use that for?

650
01:55:52,080 --> 01:55:56,070
Are those kinds of like political questions that are tricky?

651
01:55:59,700 --> 01:56:03,390
Yeah. So we were talking about the barriers to implementation.

652
01:56:03,450 --> 01:56:05,670
I think there's many barriers to implementation.

653
01:56:06,030 --> 01:56:14,999
One of the things that's challenging is that these kinds of policies, for them to be effective, like the family leave kind of policies,

654
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:22,139
the paid family leave businesses, even really large businesses can't afford to do it on their own.

655
01:56:22,140 --> 01:56:32,820
It has to be done like it's something that requires the government to do it and that requires insurance systems and like paying into it.

656
01:56:34,230 --> 01:56:44,430
It's sort of like how there's no way that a small business could afford to like to ensure the health of all of their employees.

657
01:56:44,430 --> 01:56:50,339
Right? Like you have to have these big risk pools to share the risk of things like health insurance.

658
01:56:50,340 --> 01:56:53,730
And so you also need that for things like family leave.

659
01:56:54,120 --> 01:57:03,959
And so that's really, really challenging because you can have a lot of I imagine you have a lot of business leaders and business owners

660
01:57:03,960 --> 01:57:09,900
who feel like it would be good for their company or the right thing to do to provide these kinds of benefits.

661
01:57:09,900 --> 01:57:13,440
But they really, truly can't afford to do it.

662
01:57:13,440 --> 01:57:18,270
It requires, like the intervention of the government, federal kind of government level.

663
01:57:18,930 --> 01:57:25,960
I think even the state level, unless you were in a state like California or New York that has a huge population, I think it'd be really hard to do.

664
01:57:27,790 --> 01:57:33,369
So we have a lot of very years to implementation of these kinds of policies.

665
01:57:33,370 --> 01:57:43,300
But it kind of brings up a question that Sasha and Ali raised in the discussion board, which is like, how much evidence do you need for policy?

666
01:57:43,600 --> 01:57:54,860
Do you want to say more about that, Ali? But I.

667
01:58:10,160 --> 01:58:30,870
I. Right. You know, this is one of those examples where they're showing you.

668
01:58:30,870 --> 01:58:39,030
They say there's clearly there's these four like longitudinal studies that have demonstrated the effectiveness of these interventions.

669
01:58:39,270 --> 01:58:44,950
And so it's not that there is necessarily a lack of evidence that they would be harmful.

670
01:58:45,060 --> 01:58:51,090
It's more these other like political and social kinds of things that get in the way.

671
01:58:52,740 --> 01:58:56,219
Although, you know, another thing that's a little tricky with this is that, of course,

672
01:58:56,220 --> 01:59:02,220
when you do this type of intervention, there's a lot of things happening in it at the same time.

673
01:59:02,520 --> 01:59:08,340
So it can be hard to know was it because in these programs they had masters trained teachers?

674
01:59:08,700 --> 01:59:16,439
Is that essential to the success of studies, or is it because they provided nutrition in this particular way,

675
01:59:16,440 --> 01:59:19,550
because all of those things are happening at the same time in the intervention?

676
01:59:19,950 --> 01:59:24,780
And so it can be hard to know if you tried to scale this up.

677
01:59:25,170 --> 01:59:29,220
Would it work if you didn't retain every element of the intervention?

678
01:59:29,850 --> 01:59:32,940
So that's another thing that's a little tricky because imagine.

679
01:59:33,150 --> 01:59:39,629
So let's imagine that we were able to get a bill passed that said there's going

680
01:59:39,630 --> 01:59:46,380
to be universal preschool education for children age three and four in the U.S.

681
01:59:46,410 --> 01:59:51,480
Right. And we wanted to recreate the Perry Preschool kind of setting.

682
01:59:52,560 --> 01:59:57,360
Do you think that we could find enough teachers to staff it with master's degrees in education?

683
01:59:59,490 --> 02:00:01,190
No, we're seeing this right now.

684
02:00:01,200 --> 02:00:09,210
So like during the pandemic and kind of after now, there's been this huge infusion of money into mental health treatment.

685
02:00:09,220 --> 02:00:13,530
Even at the university level. The university has committed more money to this.

686
02:00:14,130 --> 02:00:22,590
We can't find there's there aren't enough trained social workers and psychologists and whatever to fill these positions.

687
02:00:22,890 --> 02:00:26,580
So there's lots of money now to support these kinds of programs.

688
02:00:26,580 --> 02:00:30,930
But we don't have people trained in this area in order to like to hire them to fill the positions.

689
02:00:31,350 --> 02:00:34,440
So this can also be an issue with these kinds of programs,

690
02:00:34,440 --> 02:00:41,630
is that it requires a long term investment in education and training also to have like a workforce ready.

691
02:00:41,640 --> 02:00:46,020
So part of why these experimental programs work is because you need a people.

692
02:00:47,160 --> 02:00:50,370
Right. But when you if you try to scale those up, it becomes really difficult.

693
02:00:53,450 --> 02:01:00,370
Yeah. But no, I think more and more people. You have more?

694
02:01:01,600 --> 02:01:05,860
Yes. Yeah. You have to sequester them.

695
02:01:06,670 --> 02:01:10,440
Well, that's true. Yeah, that's true. But so you do.

696
02:01:10,480 --> 02:01:18,040
Right. And you need to have it. You have to have people in the pipeline for those programs because it takes years to get that kind of training.

697
02:01:18,380 --> 02:01:23,080
Um, I think I saw somewhere that social work in France, as you probably know,

698
02:01:23,080 --> 02:01:28,240
those requires 900 hours of is your internship 900 hours for social work.

699
02:01:31,340 --> 02:01:36,410
Somewhere around there. It's a lot.

700
02:01:36,920 --> 02:01:49,950
It is a lot of. So not only do you have to do the years of education, but you have to do internship hours, too, which is.

701
02:01:50,890 --> 02:01:53,020
And teaching has the same kinds of things, right?

702
02:01:53,020 --> 02:01:58,000
If you're a master's trained teacher, you have to have classroom experience and get those kinds of hours.

703
02:01:58,360 --> 02:02:02,980
So it's like a time and money investment for that.

704
02:02:04,220 --> 02:02:13,340
But I do think that was I know that all sounds discouraging, but what is encouraging, I think, is that it is possible.

705
02:02:13,520 --> 02:02:18,220
I mean, I think when you see the data from like the Utah study, right,

706
02:02:18,320 --> 02:02:23,030
where you see how this intervention really affected the outcomes for these kids,

707
02:02:23,030 --> 02:02:26,569
educational outcomes for these kids, you can say, yeah,

708
02:02:26,570 --> 02:02:33,950
this is this is not an inevitable this kind of inequality that we have is not an option at all.

709
02:02:34,110 --> 02:02:39,140
Like, it can be reduced. But but it's hard.

710
02:02:39,350 --> 02:02:48,340
It's hard to do. Any glass bottles.

711
02:02:52,280 --> 02:02:56,120
Don't move to Canada yet. We still have a couple weeks to fast, but.

712
02:02:58,940 --> 02:03:03,890
All right. Have a good weekend, everybody. Don't forget your papers due next week.
