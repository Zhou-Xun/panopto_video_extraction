1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:05,490
Now that I've signed on.

2
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:24,240
Good morning, everyone. So today we have two wonderful guests that are going to continue our discussion of dietary recalls and food records.

3
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,899
And so many of you know, Sarah and Jessica.

4
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:32,070
But for those students who do not. I'm really pleased to introduce Sarah Ball.

5
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:37,409
She is our dietetic internship director and Jessica Rick Ly,

6
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:44,220
who is our Dietetic Internship Clinical Coordinator as well as research clinical coordinator.

7
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:50,250
So I'm going to turn it over to them and this is going to be a full class.

8
00:00:51,180 --> 00:01:00,180
Thank you. As soon as Jessica and Sarah done, I do need 5 minutes for all of you at the end just to do some housekeeping.

9
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:11,550
Oh, seriously? Oh, yeah, I was just doing that.

10
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:19,530
Good morning. I know you know me as the internship director, but I actually have other roles, which is why that makes me.

11
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:24,840
Why it makes it pertinent that I'm here. I don't just randomly show up and talk about 24 hour requests.

12
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:31,919
So I also am I work for the Michigan Nutrition Obesity Research Center.

13
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:38,760
And part of my role there is to manage a core that really helps with dietary assessment for clinical investigators

14
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:44,700
who want to include that as part of their research study or should include it as part of their research study,

15
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:48,480
and don't have the expertise or staffing to do it themselves.

16
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:59,910
So as part of my role, I train new people on and BSR, which is the program that you use for dietary recall on a pretty regular basis.

17
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:04,590
So today I'm just going to give you guys really a snapshot of what that looks like.

18
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:09,300
The whole point is not to make you a trained recall hour and 45 minutes.

19
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:21,090
It's actually a pretty long process that we usually about a six hour to eight hour workshop with a lot of practice and then certification afterwards.

20
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:27,089
So right now we're just going to today is kind of objective is to underscore my talk at

21
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:31,800
least to understand the basics of conducting an interview or administer a 24 hour recall.

22
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:35,730
And then I'm going to just describe how industries use to do that.

23
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:40,680
Feel free to answer questions throughout or ask questions throughout.

24
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,840
And also, I'm going to start right off by making you guys participate.

25
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:51,600
So I know you had a brief introduction and 24 hour recalls and records the other in your other class.

26
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:58,049
And for the most part, they can be used for both research and counseling purposes, both of which we're going to talk about today.

27
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:03,780
So I'm going to do your research and Jessica is going to do counseling. But kind of in your mind, what's the difference?

28
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:09,630
When would you choose or why would you choose to do a 24 hour recall in a counseling setting?

29
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:19,770
Yeah. They were like using words like kind of breaking down the research for the time.

30
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:29,610
It was like more of the time was definitely more nitty gritty and research.

31
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:34,680
But if you're thinking about what a 24 hour recall is, you're really not providing them with any information.

32
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:39,900
You're asking them for information. So why would you be asking them for their diet and counseling?

33
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:45,959
It helps me to know what they have been eating right in a very surprised lifetime from

34
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:51,810
the 24 hours I realize how much coffee they drink and and in a day when they drink,

35
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,970
even though they are very healthy eaters in between. Yeah, absolutely.

36
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:59,940
So as of someone who's going to counsel somebody, you'd want to know, what the heck are they even eating?

37
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:07,920
Right. Yeah, getting. I help you identify what areas might need modification or definitely areas for modification or what their goals are.

38
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:14,430
Goal setting, maybe like specific foods that they're eating rather than more like general food groups.

39
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:22,950
I don't know. Absolutely. Yeah. It might help me get information about what like cooking appliances they might have access to.

40
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:28,260
So if you're, like, trying to make a modification, you can have ideas of what you wanna do.

41
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,670
Yeah, definitely. Cooking, shopping, transportation. Right.

42
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,950
All those kind of social determinants that like, why are they eating the way that they're eating?

43
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:40,589
That would be a good thing to ask, though. Generally don't ask too much in a 24 hour recall, but those would definitely be good.

44
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:44,280
Additional questions. Anybody else?

45
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:49,320
Okay, so you got a lot of them. Really.

46
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,870
It's to determine a baseline like if you're counseling someone,

47
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:57,419
especially on for a disease state or treatment or even prevention, you kind of know like where are you starting, right?

48
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:01,030
So that you can build from there and then you can show the person progress.

49
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,270
Like where? Where did they start and where they finish?

50
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:10,620
If you're wanting to do some sort of menu design or meal plan, that might not always be our role as dietitians, but it might be something that we do.

51
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:16,559
So again, you'd like to know, like, what is their usual diet assessment of your nutrition plan?

52
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:22,320
And then looking for those deficiencies, insufficiencies accesses, where should they maybe be careful?

53
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,780
And then to really document kind of actual versus perceived and take a lot of people

54
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:31,590
think that they eat a certain way and then when you actually ask them those questions,

55
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:35,069
they realize that they actually don't. So what about research?

56
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:38,190
What would you say for research? What would you use a 24 hour recall for?

57
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:43,380
Oh. Collecting data.

58
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,559
Data collection. But why? Why would you collect the data?

59
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:53,660
What would it be used for on the phone to train those people who may be drinking so much of diet soda?

60
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:57,360
And what would be the consequence they have on the system? Maybe they can do it.

61
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:02,430
Genealogy, analysis, trends and patterns. Absolutely, I think.

62
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:08,669
And HAYNES Right, yeah. Every year throughout the United States, someone's going to do doing a 24 hour recall for onions.

63
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:12,090
And that's how we get our information about what Americans eat for the most part.

64
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:22,800
What else? You had a hand up, maybe like creating an intervention, like a population based level and monitoring that intervention for sure.

65
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:29,400
Yeah. Yeah. Comparing the link between different groups for sure.

66
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:34,870
Definitely. Yeah. You use it to check like biomarkers.

67
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:46,870
So if you compared the recall and markers of the food, then you can kind of figure out what that was, how the metabolic process of the food or not.

68
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:50,739
But yeah, you can use it to confirm biomarkers.

69
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:53,500
You can use biomarkers to confirm a 24 hour recall.

70
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:59,770
So it can be used in research in a way where maybe you don't have the opportunity to do biomarkers on everybody,

71
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:03,579
but you can on a subset and then you can do 24 hour calls on everybody.

72
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:07,960
And then it's a sort of a nice confirmation that they're there tracking and accurate of each other.

73
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:17,320
Anything else? All, I think that most of them so assessing intervention, effectiveness and compliance for sure.

74
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:20,470
So pre post 24 hour recalls is a good idea.

75
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:27,790
Trends and patterns comparing certain dietary variables to different disease states.

76
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:35,229
You mentioned that epidemiological studies kind of want to see a comparison of you have this number of people have this X disease,

77
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:38,060
how are they eating and what does that mean? Okay.

78
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:48,580
So we're just going to go through the basics of an interview because one big piece of a 24 hour recall is really interviewing the participant.

79
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:54,270
And, well, there is a really nice flow and good methodology to it.

80
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:59,130
It is a little bit. Like a counseling session.

81
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:05,040
It's like it's more like you're you're kind of putting yourself in their shoes or thinking through them as a human,

82
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:09,659
and they're living and you're knowing the right questions to ask. And then you're doing some really good listening.

83
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:17,639
So we'll talk through all of that. So basically and you probably already, as you probably already told you this, but just in case in general,

84
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:24,180
if you want to assess the usual intake patterns of a human, you're going to collect three recalls.

85
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:30,300
So one on the weekend and then two on the weekdays, because as you know, we eat differently on the weekends.

86
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:33,330
In the weekdays. Right. That is ideal.

87
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:42,639
Generally you work down from there. If a study doesn't have enough money or the population just doesn't, it's not going to work like I believe.

88
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,700
And Ames is 124 hour record. You know, I don't think there's a subset does too.

89
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:54,610
Yeah. So they don't do the three. Right. So it's just a snapshot, which is hard because you guys know you eat differently day to day.

90
00:08:54,820 --> 00:09:02,889
So if you can get three, you can average them and be pretty secure that you're getting good usual intake and that three is really based

91
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:11,020
on calories if you're looking at a particular vitamin or mineral and that's really what you're honing in on,

92
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:14,320
you may have to spread that out. You may be able to decrease that.

93
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:23,230
So every particular nutrient actually has good evidence behind how many days you would need to collect to get an accurate reflection of truth.

94
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:30,370
But in general, like, let's just say realistically and logistically, three is probably a really good place to be.

95
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:37,420
Any time in research, you are blending gold standard with realism, right?

96
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:43,100
And so you always start with the gold standard and you work back from there to get what you need with the resources,

97
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:46,460
time, energy and money that you have. Okay.

98
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:51,270
So there is sort of an art to interviewing like I already alluded to, or it takes practice.

99
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:54,350
It's not something that you can just just do.

100
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:57,950
The best thing you can do to prepare it just is to be prepared.

101
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:01,610
So you're well-trained, you've practiced. You feel comfortable using the software.

102
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:06,170
You feel comfortable with the prompts, you feel comfortable talking to people.

103
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:11,240
So that is the first thing you want to do, really communicate with the participant.

104
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:17,000
This would be the same for a counseling session. You communicate with the person you're doing the interview with.

105
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:21,110
What are you going to ask? What's coming next? Why are you asking?

106
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:29,450
It's what is the flow going to look like? You're not kind of leaving things up for them to not understand what you're doing and why use them.

107
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:34,190
Open ended questions. Very, very important. And we'll walk through that a little bit more.

108
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:37,819
And then on the flip side, you're avoiding vague and leading questions, right?

109
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,760
So you really want them to tell you what they eat.

110
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:48,890
You don't want to put some sort of preconceived notion in their head about how you think they should be eating by asking questions that are closed.

111
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:55,110
Same in a counseling session. You'd want to do that, right? Establish rapport.

112
00:10:55,150 --> 00:11:01,670
So again, with any kind of situation where you're working with somebody else, you want to have a little chit chat.

113
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:05,620
You want to make them feel comfortable. There is an art to this.

114
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:12,549
They're all in a 24 hour recall session. People will tell you their life story, why they don't normally have a McDonald's.

115
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:16,630
But yesterday they did. And that's not typical. But like, usually they have more fruit.

116
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:21,370
So you kind of let them do that a little bit, but then you kind of got to bring them back to like, okay, so let's move on.

117
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:26,440
So there's like a really nice art to building rapport and having that communication,

118
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:32,420
but not letting it drag on forever because this can be long and people get really annoyed when you it's long.

119
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:37,870
So you have to have that balance and listen, visualize and remain neutral.

120
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:42,760
So your job is to listen. I think one thing I've learned over the years of doing this,

121
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,920
people will tell you a lot when they're silence and then you don't have to ask a question.

122
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:53,500
And then if you aren't paying attention and you ask that question again, they get really annoyed that you weren't listening to them.

123
00:11:53,830 --> 00:12:01,959
And so even if you're taking notes, take notes, or you're just listening and absorbing that information so that you don't have to ask that question,

124
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:06,820
or at least not no way you can confirm that question, but you don't have to re-ask it.

125
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:15,370
Visualize. So the the program that will go through provides really nice flow and prompts, but there's still things that you're going to have to ask.

126
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:22,620
And if you can't visualize the way somebody might normally eat that meal or food, you're not going to know what follow up questions to ask.

127
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:25,630
Right. So somebody tells you that.

128
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:30,900
You know, first of all, if they went through their entire day and they didn't list a single beverage,

129
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,959
you're going to want to like pay attention to that. Clearly, they drank something.

130
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:38,940
You hope that they drank something yesterday. They probably just didn't consider that part of what they needed to tell you.

131
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:42,820
Let's just say they had a hamburger.

132
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:49,520
I mean, a large portion of us also have fries with that. So you could just ask this after you've asked, did you have anything else with that?

133
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:52,530
You could also say any fries or anything that went with that.

134
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:57,120
So you're kind of visualizing the whole process. But again, you're not leading them.

135
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,360
So there are ways to do that, that that gets both things.

136
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,509
And then you're remaining neutral the whole time. So you're friendly, there's rapport.

137
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:08,219
You're moving things along. You're thanking them for recalling things,

138
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:13,440
remembering that things were telling me that you're not thinking them or praising them for like, Oh, it's great.

139
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,600
You drank that 64 ounces of water yesterday or good job you got into your vegetables.

140
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:18,540
That's not your role.

141
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:27,270
So just to kind of illustrate the point of the difference between a closed and open in the question and those of you are in counseling,

142
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:28,770
you'll get to know those really well.

143
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:36,330
So close is always kind of provide having your own preconceived notions of what you might do and then putting it on them,

144
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:39,659
right, so that you add sugar to your grapefruit. Okay.

145
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:44,580
Yeah, sugar might be a pretty popular thing to add to grapefruit, but that's letting the participant know.

146
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:47,639
Like, there's only one right answer here. It's sugar or no sugar.

147
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:50,730
And if I added anything else, I don't even think to tell you.

148
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:54,180
Because you didn't ask me that. You asked a very direct question.

149
00:13:57,310 --> 00:14:00,710
So what you could say is, did you add anything to your grapefruit?

150
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:04,150
That's like your standard question is, did you add anything to this?

151
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:07,780
Did you add anything to this? In a 24 hour recall, you were going to say that 100 times.

152
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:12,430
In fact, you're going to say it after every single food and meal. Yeah.

153
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,170
Think what is the difference between the second question to the following question.

154
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:21,790
So what did you add? Presumes that you you should have added something to your grapefruit.

155
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:27,130
Clearly, you added something to your grapefruit. What was that as opposed to did you add anything to your grapefruit?

156
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:31,360
Yeah. Tricky. And what did you do or did you do something?

157
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:34,780
Yeah. What did you do this to me? You already done something. Correct.

158
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:43,270
So instead of saying, What did you eat for breakfast, you're presuming that someone's breakfast falls in the morning time just like it was my right?

159
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,169
You're really. You want to ask, when was the first time you had something to eat or drink?

160
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:51,940
Oh, this could be 3 p.m. Right? So there are days and nights could be flipped.

161
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:55,680
That could be a shift worker, that could be a teenager that didn't wake up until noon.

162
00:14:55,690 --> 00:15:02,319
So there's all sorts of reasons why you would ask for time instead of and you

163
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,900
always want to say eat or drink because you're also getting beverages through the.

164
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:13,090
And so do you think you ate about a cup of cereal for breakfast?

165
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,769
That's presuming that we all kind of eat a cup of zero over breakfast and then you're just kind of asking them.

166
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:19,950
So you're always going to ask how much? How much did you eat?

167
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:27,190
That's the other question you're going to repeatedly ask how much, how much, how much, how much, how many, how much you're never going to presume.

168
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:34,419
Now you can move on to that. A lot of people will say, gosh, I don't know, I had like a bowl of cereal.

169
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:41,620
Well, I don't know what their bowl looks like. Right. So I, I will start somewhere and be like, okay, so imagine a measuring cup.

170
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:45,249
Do you think you had more or less than one cup?

171
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:50,920
And then they can say it was a little bit more and I'll be like, okay, you think it was maybe a cup and a quarter?

172
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:54,370
So you often have to help them visualize what a portion is.

173
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:59,379
But you would never start there. You give them a chance because most people will have some answer.

174
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:08,110
Whether it's completely accurate or not is another thing. Yeah, if you're doing this over the phone and like if they're at home at the time,

175
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:13,960
would it be appropriate to say, do you mind checking how big your goal is?

176
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,160
Because then they could if they or would they just take yes and no?

177
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:24,790
I mean, I'll often kind of say, I'm just thinking about the cereal.

178
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:30,010
I would probably start with something I know they could visualize, which would probably be a household measuring cup.

179
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:35,379
I, I still wouldn't be able to really see like they could tell me it was a large bowl,

180
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:40,180
but I don't know what that bowl means and I don't know that them going to the counter,

181
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:44,829
going to their cupboards, getting a bowl, that would take a lot of time. But there are tricks you can use, right?

182
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:48,220
You can fall back on the basics of like, was it the size of a tennis ball?

183
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:55,420
What a deck of cards, things that somebody might know. So you've got those in your brain that, like a deck of cards is about four ounces of meat.

184
00:16:55,540 --> 00:17:02,829
The four, three, three. Let's see, I don't have that in my brain, but you can fall back on those like cues if you need to.

185
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:07,570
And some people will literally just say like, hold on, let me go get it.

186
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:11,919
And that's fine. But sometimes I got to like tone that down just to chime in.

187
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:17,139
Sometimes I'll like their specialty foods, like we do research with keto diet and things like that.

188
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:23,800
And so sometimes it does help for them to grab that item. Yeah. Because sometimes we need to get the product and have to put it into the system.

189
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:29,860
So there are times where you definitely or when we do supplements, grab that vitamin because we need to know exactly what say it is.

190
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:34,330
So sometimes you do, but it does add significant time to the recall.

191
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:37,530
Yeah. All right.

192
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:41,790
So you're going to continue with this opening questions as you're walking through

193
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:47,370
the interview until you kind of obtained all the necessary information you need.

194
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:53,600
Until you clarify their meaning. So just much like counseling,

195
00:17:53,600 --> 00:18:00,889
you want to just always make sure you're hearing somebody correctly and then or and or until the responder becomes irritated or annoyed,

196
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:07,969
which definitely happens. You can sense those like at that point you ask too many questions that you need to move on because the worst thing you can

197
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:13,610
have happen is someone hang up on you in the middle of a recall because then that's basically that that was for nothing,

198
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:17,300
right? Can't go back. Can't use a half ton recall.

199
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:24,650
Okay. So generally a 24 hour recall involves this sort of multi pass method.

200
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,060
The one built into DSR is the five step method.

201
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:34,000
So first you create a quick list and you think will go through each of these individuals.

202
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:39,950
No, no, we're not. Okay. So first we create a quick list. And that's basically I like to think of it as a brain dump.

203
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:45,410
You're providing quick cues, quick questions, and then you were just letting them talk through their day.

204
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:52,940
Whatever they say, you're recording. Okay. Then you kind of go through that click list and you sort of make sure you didn't miss anything.

205
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:59,630
So you're asking some questions around that. Then you're going through in you're asking for details how things are prepared, food amounts.

206
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:06,139
You can do this for a step which is forgotten foods which we generally skip because it's a little tedious.

207
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:08,990
But you can go through a forgotten foods list and we'll talk more about that.

208
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:12,470
And then you would go through the whole thing and review it for details again.

209
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:15,740
And as we walk through a recall, kind of show you each of these steps.

210
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:20,810
But these steps are purposeful. They're not just there for no reason.

211
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:27,229
The biggest one of the biggest biases you're going to have in recalls is memory bias.

212
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:33,260
Like you think you know what you ate yesterday. But I guarantee you, if I asked you right now, you would be like, Oh, crap, what did I eat yesterday?

213
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:38,180
Right? Especially because you've already eaten breakfast again, so who knows what you ate yesterday for breakfast.

214
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:44,360
So this is really kind of trying it's giving them multiple opportunities to remember is what it's doing,

215
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,950
but it kind of annoys some people because it does seem very repetitive.

216
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:54,469
Okay, so let's walk through and these are sort of app as an application.

217
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:58,370
So what is ending Assad's nutrient data systems for research?

218
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:06,140
That is right now the gold standard we have for interviewer assisted recalls in records.

219
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:11,420
It was created many, many years ago by the University of Minnesota's Nutrition Coordinating Center.

220
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:15,590
They still run it. They still do all the licensing. It's an expensive program.

221
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:21,560
It's not something that you just decide you want to use and put on your computer because it is several grand,

222
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:28,910
probably about five grand for the initial license. It is also not web based.

223
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:34,700
So unfortunately, you can't just log in to any computer and use that program, which is a really big bummer.

224
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,070
You have to have a license per computer.

225
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:44,510
So if you were a large research institution that does a lot of these recalls, you're going to have multiple licenses and it can get pretty pricey.

226
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:50,360
But that is honestly a lot of times why people don't do these themselves in a research study.

227
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:54,170
They contract with somebody that already has the license to do that for them.

228
00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:04,950
So if you think back to decades ago and how you did a recall, right, you would sit with somebody, you would walk through their day,

229
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:11,350
you would maybe kind of know the multipart method in your head, but you would have to think of all these prompts for each food.

230
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:16,440
You would then take what they told you, you would go to some food composition notebook,

231
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:21,609
you would look up all the nutrients, you would plug it into some sort of computer thing.

232
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:26,620
And then many, many days, weeks, months later, you would actually get an output for what they ate, right?

233
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:30,130
So this computer program does all of that in real time.

234
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:35,920
So as you're interviewing, you're typing foods in and then as you go through, it's calculating everything.

235
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:45,600
And so it's really based on our standard USDA databases, but then also just the food that's on the market.

236
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:49,719
So the Nutrition Coordinating Center is adding foods all the time.

237
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:53,770
Every year they add new foods based on like what's on the market, what are people eating?

238
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:57,190
And you can request foods to be added in the way they do.

239
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:03,549
That is they really use the nutrition facts panel and the ingredient list to do that because clearly they're not.

240
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:12,090
What would be the best thing to do is to take that food and go out and do a chemical analysis on it and get all the nutrient data.

241
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:18,909
What, you just can't do that. So they're really relying on that nutrient flux panel, which I find a little scary sometimes,

242
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:22,330
because if you've ever looked at a nutrient facts panel, you can find mistakes.

243
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:26,720
So it's interesting. Okay.

244
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,560
So India's attorney general has a couple of functions I could do recalls.

245
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:38,420
It can do records, it can do menus, it could do meal planning. They all actually look very much the same with the exception of doing menus,

246
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:42,889
which is a pretty new, new fancy function that I haven't even figured out myself yet.

247
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:48,920
We're not going to talk about today, but it does make menu work for research really handy as well.

248
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:58,120
So the basic program features and I've already sort of alluded to this, is that there are prompts built in, so it's guiding the interview process.

249
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:02,420
You don't have to think, Oh no, what was I supposed to ask next?

250
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:08,969
You're always the prompts are right there leading you. There are defaults built in for unknown answers.

251
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:13,879
So if someone says, Gosh, I really don't know what kind of letter that was, I didn't make that meal.

252
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:22,790
I don't know if there was oil added to it. You can put unknown and then it just defaults to kind of what is the most popular answer.

253
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:27,700
In the US at the time that would fit in there and that's what they use.

254
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:33,630
Data is automatically backed up. So you're not constantly worried about losing your data.

255
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:39,660
Quality assurance is built in, which is really nice. There's this thing called a minimum maximum shock.

256
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:46,110
So if you put in an amount for a food that seems odd.

257
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:49,710
It'll pop up and say, basically, Are you sure you mean this?

258
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:53,040
So let's say I put in this person, ate a large cheese pizza.

259
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:59,639
It'll pop up and say, Are you sure you mean this, that I can go, Oh, either, yes, I did another enlarge pizza or No,

260
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:05,190
I meant to put one slice and I hit the whole pizza by mistake because that's a huge nutrient difference.

261
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:05,459
Right.

262
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:13,950
And so those are built in where it can be a little bit annoying and you might not use it as if you're doing kids, especially toddlers or preschoolers,

263
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:21,120
because that minimum is, you know, their normal intake might be a minimum for an adult and it's set at sort of adult standards.

264
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:27,659
Different reports can be generated. So generally when you're doing a large research study, you're not looking at the data,

265
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:33,510
you're not generating reports in the moment, you're not providing the participant with any information.

266
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:37,700
Usually you're waiting until you've collected all of the recalls,

267
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:42,030
baseline results for 100 people, and then you hand the investigator a large data set.

268
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:47,910
But if you wanted to, you could hand them a complete nutrient analysis report right on the spot.

269
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:56,520
You can give them an RDA report like how does it, you know, how does their intake compare to what they ideally should be getting?

270
00:24:56,530 --> 00:25:03,120
Right. There is a portion size estimation tool built in, however we rarely use it.

271
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:11,400
It's like a booklet and has pictures and it gives participants a visual of like and then you can take you'll be like,

272
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:19,110
okay, how, how much should you fill your glass for? Which glass on this page represents the glass of milk you had and then how folded you fill it.

273
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:26,489
And they can say, you know, glass a two line C and then that is interpreted in the computer as a very specific amount, right?

274
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:30,209
Like six fluid ounces or something. It's hard to use.

275
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:34,860
I think maybe that's just my own bias. Whenever I look at it, I'm like, I don't know, my plate wasn't that big.

276
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:39,270
It doesn't look like that. It's 2D, item 3D. So it's like that doesn't make sense.

277
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:45,150
Also, we're doing phone calls and like, how often is a participant going to have that with them?

278
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:50,910
I mean, we'll talk to people in our car. So it's just it's just not very usable for the most part.

279
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:56,760
Okay. Before I kind of go through and these are step by step, any questions?

280
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:03,890
Just for like the food nutrition information. Like I know we've used the USDA database.

281
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:07,730
Is that where this system is calling from or it's like it's own, like separate?

282
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:12,620
No. It's going to pull from the main databases that exist out there first.

283
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:16,010
Yeah. You see somebody else over?

284
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:24,469
No. Okay. So this is sort of what when you open up India are the first thing you're going to do is kind of input this information.

285
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:29,720
So obviously all participants are going to have an idea. It's going to ask you for the date of intake.

286
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,760
That's the date they actually ate the food.

287
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:36,860
When you're doing your recall, it immediately defaults to yesterday because clearly you're asking about yesterday.

288
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:41,120
So you're always asking about the previous 24 hours.

289
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:45,739
You're never asking about three days ago if you wanted to record information that way,

290
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:51,050
you would hand somebody a food record ahead of time and say, record your food intake on these days, right?

291
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:55,760
You would never ask somebody to recall three days ago you want their date of

292
00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:00,560
birth and their sex and then it'll come up with a life stage group for you.

293
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:06,590
And that's how that RDA report is generated is based on their life stage group.

294
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,920
So there's always an introductory script.

295
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:15,830
Obviously you have to have something to say when you call them and you have a very prepared sort of thing that you're going to say to them.

296
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:21,290
The key takeaway points are basically like letting them know this is going to take a bit of time.

297
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:25,399
It's not a five minute process. So if you don't have 20 to 30 minutes, I'll call you back.

298
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:31,850
No problem. But what you don't want to do is get 5 minutes into an interview and have someone say, Oh my gosh, the electrician just showed up.

299
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:37,190
I've got to go now. We are never going to get them back on the phone again, just the reality of the situation.

300
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:42,770
So you just ask the next important thing is like tell them exactly what they're doing.

301
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:47,030
We're going to make a list of all the foods and beverages you ate yesterday, right?

302
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:53,269
Tell them what that means. Take samples of food, water, everything you put in your mouth with the exception of medications.

303
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:59,630
And I will tell you, people want to tell you their medications, too, and you just kind of listen to that and you let it go because you don't need it.

304
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:08,510
But they'll tell you everything. And then the next big point that I always like to make is like there are no right or wrong answers.

305
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:13,880
There is no judgment here just to get an accurate report of what you eat.

306
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:19,980
And then the other thing is just have them think back to yesterday, say just think back to yesterday.

307
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:23,309
And I always say think back to yesterday, which was Wednesday.

308
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:29,910
I like put a day on it. Oftentimes that takes me a second to crank out what was yesterday and hopefully it all adds up.

309
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:35,630
But I try to let them know and then you just tell them to think back to where you were.

310
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:39,209
Was it a work day? Was it a home day? You know, where are you babysitting your grandchildren?

311
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:43,380
So that'll immediately trigger the memories to kind of come back of like, where was I?

312
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:49,409
Right. Okay, so you get through all of that and the first prompt is after midnight.

313
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:52,230
What was the first time you had something to eat or drink?

314
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:58,309
I ignore the after midnight because I think that is incredibly hard for people to visualize.

315
00:28:58,310 --> 00:29:03,770
So think about what that means right now. We're in Thursday, we're asking about yesterday.

316
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:08,200
So you're talking about the midnight that almost occurred, what, 36 hours ago?

317
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:11,870
They're thinking about the midnight that was last night that they just got through.

318
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:18,350
So I don't even go there. I just say, after you woke up yesterday, what was the first time you had something to eat or drink?

319
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:24,860
And then throughout the interview, you get a sense of are they a shift worker or is there something order different about their schedule?

320
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:30,830
Because then you can ask other questions and I'll often rap back and say, Did you eat anything in the middle of the night?

321
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:37,190
Or if they're still telling me snacks at 11 p.m., I'll just keep asking like, did you keep eating?

322
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:43,340
And then I'll just make sure I get a 24 hour period. And the next pop is always like, What did you have at that time?

323
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:47,690
You'll let them say when they stop and you say anything else at that time.

324
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:54,409
So you're just those are your brief quick prompts and you were typing it in, see if it shows what it is right there.

325
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:58,490
So you're just typing in the time you're typing in the foods exactly as they say it,

326
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:06,830
and then you're just moving through the day and then you the next step is to go back and be like, Oh, let me review what you just told me.

327
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:11,690
And actually, maybe there's a slide. Yeah. So let's review what we have so far and then you're just quickly going through.

328
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:15,290
Okay, so you told me around seven you might copy Cheerios and a banana.

329
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:22,099
Did you have anything else at that time? Again, you're constantly asking to do anything else at that time and you're going through that the day.

330
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:26,660
So you're going through what they already told you to make sure that you heard everything, clarifying it.

331
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:31,099
At the same time, you're looking for like very large gaps in time.

332
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:35,239
So say that they had something at seven and then they didn't eat again at three.

333
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:38,750
That might be perfectly correct and normal, but you want to just double check that.

334
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:43,600
So I notice you didn't have anything between seven and three, is that correct?

335
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:48,830
Yes. No. Oh, I really did have a granola bar on the way to the gym, you know, that kind of thing.

336
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:54,139
You're also at this point, this is what I always look and be like. Did they drink anything?

337
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:57,379
Okay. They just told me coffee. Surely they drank something else.

338
00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:05,120
What was that? And then this is another place where they might tell you additional foods that they had, and then you can add those in.

339
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:11,870
So then you're going to move on and you want to capture not only the time but the name of the meal.

340
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:18,829
What do they consider this meal to be? Oftentimes when they go through the interview, they'll say, like for breakfast I had.

341
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:23,180
So you would ask this again? That would be annoying, right? That's part of that, like listening as you go.

342
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:27,530
But if they didn't, then you just kind of say, what meal would you consider this to be for yourself?

343
00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:34,040
Because everybody kind of considers things differently. And then the location is where they eat the food, not where the food came from.

344
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:39,500
So if they went through the McDonald's drive thru and ate it in their car, you would put traveling.

345
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:44,450
If they went through, if they went into McDonald's and ate some food, it would be at a fast food joint.

346
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:47,750
If they went to the drive thru and went home, then it's at home. Yeah.

347
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:51,830
So these are like dropdown menu. These are dropdown menu. So there's only a few options.

348
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:58,340
Yes, there's actually quite a few options. So then it's going to start going through that next stage.

349
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:02,690
We're just going to walk you through breakfast and everything they told you and give you some more prompts.

350
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:09,679
So again, it pops up the Cheerios that they said they had and you can say, okay, you had Cheerios for breakfast.

351
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:14,270
Did you add anything to this Cheerios? They might have already told you they had Cheerios and milk.

352
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:18,860
And if that's the case, you can say, okay, you already told me you had knock with your Cheerios.

353
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:27,500
Did you put anything else on there? And you're going to keep asking that question theoretically until they stop answering us.

354
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:35,960
This is usually where I cut corners because it gets a little tedious and you kind of understand that after a while you've gotten everything,

355
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:42,139
and then your next thing is like, What type of brand of Cheerios? I'll just kind of say what kind of Cheerios that you have,

356
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:45,980
because God knows there are 4000 types of Cheerios and you're going to want to choose the right one.

357
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:50,840
And these are there are some things that are just like generic.

358
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,950
So, for instance, like for jelly or jam, it's just going to say jelly or jam.

359
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:59,070
Let's face it, nutrient wise, there is no difference between a grape jelly and a strawberry jelly.

360
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:02,989
So you don't need that kind of detail. But for Cheerios, there might be.

361
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:05,300
So they have that you choose the correct one.

362
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:12,890
And you can keep changing the food in the search bar at that point if you're not quite getting to what you are.

363
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:17,750
Cheerios is simple, but there might be something else where you're like, Oh, it's not quite that, but it's this.

364
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:25,579
And so you just keep searching until you find what you need. And then the milk is going to come out because they said they had milk on Cheerios.

365
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:29,660
And again, you're going to ask them what kind of milk was it in there? You're going to find the correct type.

366
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:35,540
And then the next question for that food is going to be how much did you did you eat or drink?

367
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:43,160
And so. With Serial. It's tricky because often times they'll want to kind of tell you if the full amount

368
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:47,330
for the full bowl of cereal when really you need the Cheerios separate from the milk.

369
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:53,390
So that's a little bit tricky. Usually they can quantify the cereal, okay, it's the milk they have an issue with.

370
00:33:54,410 --> 00:34:01,240
So for something like this, I might ask. Or your Cheerios drowning in milk or do you like them kind of dry?

371
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:06,709
And then I'll kind of like get you a sense of like what they tell you because if they say they had a cup of Cheerios and a cup of milk,

372
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:14,150
I'm always like. So you like them very soupy. Or like I, you know, like clarify that because that sounds to me like that might be a lot.

373
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:21,320
And then these are the, the units you can choose. So they're weights and volumes for the most part.

374
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:27,290
Just a note on this, milk and water or volumes.

375
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:30,829
We in the states always say ounces. Ounces is actually a weights.

376
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:39,049
We don't weigh or milk in our water. We measure it. And so you want to make sure that the the unit you're choosing in here is the correct one,

377
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:44,060
because the follow up questions that they might ask are based on choosing the correct units.

378
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:53,630
So, for instance, if you said you had iced tea and I put in six fluid ounces of iced tea, the next question is going to be with or without ice.

379
00:34:53,930 --> 00:34:59,629
And then the program will remove the amount of iced tea if you say it had ice,

380
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:06,110
because obviously if someone says I had an eight ounce glass of iced tea with ice, there is not eight ounces of actual iced tea in there.

381
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:09,890
Well, if I put that they had just eight ounces instead of eight.

382
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:14,599
Blue announces that question's not going to occur because it's presumed that I've weighed the iced tea.

383
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:19,799
Right. So that's why that's important. Lasagna.

384
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:27,690
And I pull this up because it's kind of an interesting example of how detailed you can get because I think as nutrition professionals,

385
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:31,070
our first thing would be like, Oh my gosh, there are 400 ways you can make lasagna.

386
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,930
Like, How am I going to do this and that? You're going to want to ask about a recipe.

387
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:39,540
You really don't want to ask about a recipe because you can't put that in there for one serving and it's going to take,

388
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:42,809
you know, 15 minutes to do this one. Yeah. So there are a lot of questions.

389
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:46,500
It's just going to start getting to make it yourself. Was it from Frozen?

390
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:53,040
Do you not know? And then you choose. And so then from there, like I chose that I made lasagna from a recipe.

391
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:57,400
So Amazon is happy beat so it's going to start there. That had me not made.

392
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,960
If it had me, what kind of meat was it?

393
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:06,670
So when you choose the right meat, even though they only list a couple of meats here and this is probably an old version, I bet they've added more.

394
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:11,760
There are a ton of meats in the system. You can always go through and change the meat later like let's.

395
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:15,580
So they had bison, ground bison. You could put that in there.

396
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:20,350
Let's say they had beans. You can swap out the meat for beans, obviously at a later stage.

397
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:25,480
So we did some we they they had hamburger in there.

398
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:27,700
You're going to ask them how lean was the hamburger?

399
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:33,820
So pretty much in India, are the nutrients you're always trying to get or fat and salt from any kind of food.

400
00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:37,930
So those are always pretty standard questions. So this is getting fat.

401
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:41,590
And then the lasagna noodles where they wait, whole wheat, spinach unknown.

402
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:45,429
I know there are a ton of different noodles out there. There are lentil noodles.

403
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:50,290
You can change that later. They might even be on there now. And then the cheese.

404
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:54,250
I don't know if strangely, people put cottage cheese in their lasagna. I would never do that.

405
00:36:54,250 --> 00:37:05,860
I'm totally a ricotta girl, but apparently people do. So you would ask them and then you want to know, like, okay, they chose ricotta cheese.

406
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:09,759
What's the fat percentage again? Fat and then salts.

407
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,329
And it's not just did you have salt or not salt in your recipe?

408
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:16,810
What kind of salt was it? Was it a salt substitute? Was it low sodium salt?

409
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:23,440
Now they're asking more like sea salt, Himalayan salt, probably to get at the mineral content a little bit.

410
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:29,150
All right. So we've done this entire recall of their entire day.

411
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:32,660
And the last thing we're going to do is review and ask if they have any questions.

412
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:35,720
How am I doing on time? Ooh, so good. Okay.

413
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:44,450
If you've done a really thorough review of that quick list, I make this a little shorter.

414
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:48,890
If you did a quicker review of the quick list, I make this a little bit more thorough.

415
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:56,360
This could get very tedious. If somebody runs through every single detail and they're going to tune out.

416
00:37:56,460 --> 00:38:03,050
And so think about if I'm sitting there going, okay, you had two one half cups of coffee from ground with one container,

417
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:05,840
which is about point five fluid ounces of half and half.

418
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:10,880
And then you add in a packet of sugar like and then you do that for every food there does at that point,

419
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:13,520
nodding in their head and going, yep, yep, yep.

420
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:18,979
But what you're really trying to get them to do is tell you, did they forget something that this trigger a memory?

421
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:27,110
Did you get something completely wrong? And so I always go through it a little bit less detailed, and then I pause.

422
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:31,310
Anything else you can think about about this, and then give them a chance to kind of think about it.

423
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:40,510
All right. So then lastly, after you've done their entire meal, you'll collect supplements if the study asks you to.

424
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:44,260
We all hate supplements. Supplements are a nightmare.

425
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:46,900
Everybody take supplements these days.

426
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:52,870
I will tell you, when COVID hit and we were doing recalls the number of people who all of a sudden were taking vitamin C,

427
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:57,519
zinc and vitamin D went up tremendously. Those are actually easy, easy ones.

428
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,100
It's the herbal ones you've never heard of that are a nightmare.

429
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:08,200
So we do collect supplements, but we're always when an investigator says, Yeah, I don't need supplements, we're like, Oh, okay, good.

430
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:16,269
Because that adds tremendous time onto the recall, too. But past all of that, you're going to kind of think through these two questions.

431
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:21,909
So the first one you're actually going to ask in the terms and in terms of the amount of food you eat.

432
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:29,520
And really the key word here is amounts. Would you say this is close to usual or a lot more or a lot less?

433
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:34,930
And I always emphasize that because this is where they're going to go rogue and they're going to tell you, well,

434
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:41,380
it was okay, but I normally only have two snacks and I had one yesterday and I don't usually go through the drive through.

435
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:50,440
And really what I want to know is, were you sick yesterday and you skip two meals or was it like Thanksgiving and you ate way more than usual?

436
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:55,240
Other than that, like I'm just choosing the middle one and going the big question over here.

437
00:39:55,420 --> 00:40:00,370
Yes, it's been sometimes in this hour. And I'm wondering about the supplements in particular.

438
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:08,049
Do you do a manual entry of the different formulations or are some of them already available?

439
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:14,230
Or why does it take so much time? Well, first, you hope that it is already in there.

440
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:23,140
That is best case scenario. There are a lot in there, but there's a lot of supplement foods even that aren't in there.

441
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:28,989
And it just takes a long time because you're adding on additional questions.

442
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:32,320
Sometimes they have to go get the bottle. Ideally they'll go get the bottle.

443
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:37,329
And then there's just a lot of questions about each supplement and so it just takes forever.

444
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:40,540
But yeah, in terms of what's in there, they've got a good database.

445
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:46,150
It comes from the national supplement database, but there's also a lot they don't have.

446
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:56,770
Sure, if you've been to any GNC lately, like there's 40,000 supplements I was going to add in to sometimes to like even if they take vitamin D 2000,

447
00:40:57,370 --> 00:41:01,629
but now we have IU first micrograms and whatnot. And if they don't have it, they're trying to remember.

448
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:05,040
And sometimes if I type it in exactly what they said, it's not there.

449
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:10,780
I know it's in the system. So sometimes it takes me time to type it in just the right way to be like, Oh, there's the one that I was looking for.

450
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:15,459
But you can search by brand, you can do, you know, nature's bounty was nature made and all that.

451
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:19,960
But sometimes, like, if you forget just the right letter, it's not intuitive.

452
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:21,370
Sometimes it is, sometimes it's not.

453
00:41:21,370 --> 00:41:27,309
So it just takes so much longer supplements than they like to tell you stories about why they're on it and all this.

454
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:30,850
So yeah, it's the stories.

455
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:35,979
I did do a full on counseling session with somebody one day because she was like so upset about something that she ate.

456
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:40,969
And I was like, Oh, I'm going to put on my Emmy hat right now and I'm going to like help her through this.

457
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:46,210
And fortunately, like, it only took a few minutes. I was like, Wow, this is not what I was expecting.

458
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:51,969
Okay, so after you ask them about amounts, what you're going to do is in your brain you're not going to ask them,

459
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:55,570
but in your brain you're going to think to yourself with this unreliable recall.

460
00:41:55,570 --> 00:42:03,729
And how do you determine that? Okay. It's very subjective. Not very subjective, but it is subjective when you ask them questions.

461
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:07,420
Did they seem like they were able to remember it or was there a lot of like, I don't know.

462
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:14,290
I don't know. I don't know. Honestly, if I get on a phone with somebody and there's a lot of like hemming and hawing and like,

463
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:20,499
I can't remember and I don't know, I just immediately abandon ship and say, like, this probably isn't a good day for you.

464
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:26,319
I'll just call back another day because why go through all of this and the market?

465
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:33,459
Unreliable, because at the end of the day, my recommendation to any investigator is going to be to toss in unreliable recall,

466
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:37,180
unless it's unreliable for a very specific reason. That makes sense.

467
00:42:38,830 --> 00:42:44,080
We do a lot of studies where they might have had to fast the day before for a blood draw.

468
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:49,780
Clearly, if we call and they're like, Oh, I fasted, okay, first of all, why did you fast?

469
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:57,730
Is that normal? If they're on intermittent faster, we might actually do that day because that's pretty normal for them and we want to capture that.

470
00:42:57,970 --> 00:43:02,500
It was like, No, I had to have my blood drawn. I didn't get a draw until three and then I started eating them.

471
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:08,170
We'll just be like, in a bad day, we'll move on. But let's say you didn't get to all that and you have to kind of determine here.

472
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:12,100
So you're going to think is a reliable is it unreliable because the participant

473
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:17,950
was unable to recall like basically an entire meal or for some other reason?

474
00:43:19,990 --> 00:43:30,580
I did do a recall once. Where it was like the adult child was having trouble kind of understanding.

475
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:34,180
And so I was with the parent too, and they were trying to fill in the gaps.

476
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:39,850
But you could really tell that like what you were getting at the end. Not really sure how close to real it was.

477
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:43,659
And that might be a case where I would have market as unreliable for other reasons,

478
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:48,549
and then I would just put very detailed notes in here so that the investigator could make

479
00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:53,020
a judgment call on whether they considered that unreliable and could use the data or not.

480
00:43:53,500 --> 00:44:00,690
There are a multitude of places in India where you can type notes, and when I train, I always say I like the more notes, the better.

481
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:04,090
Like don't look back on notes, you don't have to use them.

482
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:07,989
But once you're done with that, you're never going to get that information again.

483
00:44:07,990 --> 00:44:12,880
And as an interviewer, you're likely not going to remember. At least I'm not.

484
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:17,500
I'm always amazed at what others can remember, but I'm not going to remember. And so the more notes, the better.

485
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:23,440
And then this is a showing where you would go to get some reports and also the reports

486
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:28,569
that you could get immediately after clicking that you were finished with the recall,

487
00:44:28,570 --> 00:44:34,030
you could get those reports just to quickly go over strengths and limitations of.

488
00:44:34,030 --> 00:44:36,459
And these are so strengths. They're yearly updates.

489
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:43,630
They keep tabs on the food marketplace and what's being added and what people are reading so they know what to add.

490
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:48,610
It's a really large database, honestly. This is an extremely large database.

491
00:44:48,910 --> 00:44:56,200
You guys are going to do, say 24, which is a self administered recall that a database comes from this database.

492
00:44:56,200 --> 00:45:02,440
So it's the same information. It's not like all of these programs have different food information.

493
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:08,049
It integrates the recall with the data entry and coding. So it's all built into one.

494
00:45:08,050 --> 00:45:14,640
You don't have to think about it and you get immediate results. Limitations already kind of talked about this is costly, is really out of date.

495
00:45:14,710 --> 00:45:18,970
Like, I mean, you saw the computer program. Does that not look like it's from the seventies?

496
00:45:18,970 --> 00:45:24,520
Like. Yes. And there are definite times where I'm like, oh, jeez, this is so clunky.

497
00:45:25,150 --> 00:45:28,540
But, you know, they're like a pretty small shop at the end of the day.

498
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:32,829
And so this is what we have, love it to be web based,

499
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:41,110
but they have not figured out how to do that without people basically stealing the software and passing it to others,

500
00:45:41,110 --> 00:45:45,430
because this is a huge chunk of time and resources for them.

501
00:45:45,670 --> 00:45:49,960
They need to recoup those costs. And so I think making it web based would make that really hard.

502
00:45:51,010 --> 00:45:54,129
That would make all of our life easier. Okay, quick takeaway points.

503
00:45:54,130 --> 00:45:58,990
I'm going to turn it over to Jessica. Basically, any kind of recall, it's all in the details.

504
00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:03,459
So if you're taking in information that's incorrect, that's what you're going to put back out.

505
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:07,090
So that's why you go through this really standardized process.

506
00:46:07,090 --> 00:46:13,510
That's why you're well trained. I will tell you, the best dietary interviewers are those who know food.

507
00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:17,010
If you shop and you cook. And you pay attention.

508
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:21,450
You can do this really well. You do not have to be a dietitian.

509
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:29,400
In fact, I've had dietitians or dietetic interns who do this and they don't cook and they don't shop very, very much and they don't know what to ask.

510
00:46:30,450 --> 00:46:38,400
If you were a born and raised vegan, you're going to really have to work to figure out what you need to know before you go into this.

511
00:46:38,430 --> 00:46:44,190
After I train people, I always say, go to the grocery store, go through every I'll check out every counter,

512
00:46:44,190 --> 00:46:49,710
honestly, especially if you're into nutrition and diet, because you probably don't visit one of those aisles.

513
00:46:50,070 --> 00:46:54,000
I know we're all told to go to the perimeter and that's pretty much what I do naturally.

514
00:46:54,000 --> 00:47:00,870
And I'll be amazed. We're all walked in the cereal aisle one day and be like, Well, there's like 400 new products I had no idea existed.

515
00:47:01,230 --> 00:47:07,500
Right. Meats, like they're shoes. I'm a meat eater. There are still cuts that I have no idea what they're talking about.

516
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:09,510
So just kind of being aware of all those things.

517
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:18,870
Also like it's really nice to know about and DSR, even if you never go into research because when you are looking critically evaluating research,

518
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:21,989
studies, interventions, you can see that they use this.

519
00:47:21,990 --> 00:47:25,800
Did they do recalls? Did they do three recalls that they only do run recall?

520
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:29,610
Did they use assay 24 as opposed to using those?

521
00:47:29,610 --> 00:47:34,560
And you'll see the differences. And then I'll just kind of give you food for thought when you're thinking about that.

522
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:41,430
And then obviously it takes training and practice. It should be talked about. So any other questions before I pass it along?

523
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:48,050
Yeah. How likely is it for you when you asked?

524
00:47:48,230 --> 00:47:51,799
Did you add anything to avoid becoming repetitive?

525
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:58,910
With the question to add a few options, would you add a few options and would you not to avoid steering it?

526
00:47:59,030 --> 00:48:03,380
Nope, I wouldn't add. So let's say they had they already told me like I had a biscuit with butter.

527
00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:07,549
I'll just say, okay, you had a biscuit. You already said you had butter on it. Anything else?

528
00:48:07,550 --> 00:48:11,270
And if they say, no, it wasn't. If they say jelly, I'll just say it. And a job, anything else?

529
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:17,509
I mean, it's pretty quick. Yeah, but I also will say I'll actually change that a lot of times.

530
00:48:17,510 --> 00:48:21,460
Like, let's say they had taco chips. Did you add anything?

531
00:48:21,470 --> 00:48:25,000
Sounds really weird. So I'll kind of say, did you add or dip it in anything?

532
00:48:25,510 --> 00:48:31,060
So I'll sort of change my wording based on the food just to make it more clear, like in coffee.

533
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:37,389
Wouldn't that have limited options, like, or do you not want to do this for other people?

534
00:48:37,390 --> 00:48:40,420
Can other things, I mean, like don't make any assumptions, right?

535
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:43,990
You just keep asking, is that all you added? Anything else?

536
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:49,900
I will say sometimes they kind of laugh back at you, especially when you have a good rapport and it'll be like,

537
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:51,760
Did you get anything that like, of course I didn't.

538
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:57,819
And I'm like, We just always ask on every food and once you explain that to them, they're pretty good with it, but they'll still giggle about,

539
00:48:57,820 --> 00:49:05,020
like I used to say, Applebee's, you get anything but like an orange, maybe like most people don't add anything to an orange, but you never know.

540
00:49:05,110 --> 00:49:07,669
You ask anyway, because then they'll laugh. And I'm like, Of course I'm like, All right.

541
00:49:07,670 --> 00:49:12,309
I just had to ask because sometimes you get like I have people, they put salt on.

542
00:49:12,310 --> 00:49:17,460
Watermelon is a really big thing for some people, but I learned that by doing stuff like this and I would have never know.

543
00:49:17,530 --> 00:49:20,740
But I'm like, Did you get anything? You're watermelon salt, okay?

544
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:24,960
You know, you just roll with it. But you always got to ask. Yeah, maybe.

545
00:49:24,970 --> 00:49:25,530
Or sometimes.

546
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:39,460
But do you find that it's you get more information back then with a friend told you like you were saying if they had like the chips do different

547
00:49:40,990 --> 00:49:52,389
okay great your chips and you didn't do anything else you find that they are more likely to add information if you repeat back what their he said.

548
00:49:52,390 --> 00:49:59,260
I can't say either way. I probably don't ask quite that because if you did that for every food,

549
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:05,559
it would be tedious and because generally they've already told you a lot of information.

550
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:10,290
So you're just sort of confirming most people that they've had chips in guacamole.

551
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:14,500
They just say, that's right. And so you're just going to say, oh, you just welcome all anything else with that?

552
00:50:15,610 --> 00:50:20,799
But I don't go in quite the detail you're saying right there. Yeah, yeah.

553
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:25,330
I don't ever find it hard to find. Like it's a good portion of brain foods,

554
00:50:25,330 --> 00:50:33,880
like something that's not found in my or the it's not like especially like a specialty like specific to that culture thing over quite rarely.

555
00:50:34,060 --> 00:50:42,459
It's so easy. I mean, there's a lot in here, but let's say there is like an oftentimes there is a food that translates very nicely.

556
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:45,010
So maybe they ate a very particular Asian green.

557
00:50:46,030 --> 00:50:51,969
We probably have something exactly like that similar in nutrient content, but we just don't have it readily available.

558
00:50:51,970 --> 00:50:55,690
So it's not in there. You can just swap it out. So you just kind of have to know food, right?

559
00:50:55,690 --> 00:50:59,139
Like you look it up afterwards. They told me this, I don't know what that is.

560
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:01,120
What would be similar because you're not finding it,

561
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:07,240
but they really have a lot of cultural foods in there and I'm sure they're trying to keep that up to date as much as possible.

562
00:51:09,910 --> 00:51:18,760
Anything else? All righty. All right.

563
00:51:18,770 --> 00:51:22,280
So I'm going to look at notes a lot more than Sarah did. She's done this talk several times.

564
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:28,389
Yeah, I have not idea. So I'm going to then take a whole different approach that is very research based,

565
00:51:28,390 --> 00:51:34,360
which clearly I work with Sarah in the research over in the basement over an m crew over there.

566
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:38,499
And we do a lot of these 24 hour recalls. But my background is clinical.

567
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:45,230
And so I want to especially for those of you who are looking at dietetics and whatnot, even if not working, as, you know, a nutritionist,

568
00:51:45,250 --> 00:51:52,030
you know, in a clinic or a community setting, you are going to want to get diet information from clients or her patients.

569
00:51:52,540 --> 00:51:55,390
So where does this differ? And that's where we're going with this.

570
00:51:56,440 --> 00:52:02,650
So what we're going to do is just look at the different categories of data that we're going to obtain during a food and nutrition history,

571
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:07,240
and then differentiate between what Sarah talked about and then what we would do in our clinical practice.

572
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:13,959
So this class is nutrition assessment, and when we are speaking dietetics in a clinical practice,

573
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:17,590
there are five different domains that we look at in a clinical assessment.

574
00:52:17,890 --> 00:52:23,440
And this has morphed over time, as you know. KHEDR And the Academy, Anderson, they all work together on this.

575
00:52:24,070 --> 00:52:26,020
But these are the different things you're going to assess.

576
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:32,559
And I know Sue goes over pretty much all of this stuff, just, you know, in different order is of it, but you're going to get anthropometric.

577
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:37,270
And so those are things like height, weight, BMI, children.

578
00:52:37,270 --> 00:52:45,249
It's going to be where are they at on the growth charts, body composition, sometimes doing fat mass and muscle mass, you're going to do biochemical.

579
00:52:45,250 --> 00:52:47,920
These are going to be your labs, your medical test, your procedures.

580
00:52:48,250 --> 00:52:54,370
A lot of this stuff, especially these two you're going to get from, you know, a patient chart or a patient history and intake form.

581
00:52:55,300 --> 00:53:01,390
Then we start getting into more, you know, where does a dietician or, you know, a specialized trained in this, where do we jump in more?

582
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:06,580
We have the nutrition focused physical findings. That's from your nutrition focused physical exam.

583
00:53:06,610 --> 00:53:11,019
So you're examining their body, looking at things like muscle, subcutaneous fat,

584
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:15,640
oral health sucking, swallowing, breathing ability, appetite, their affect.

585
00:53:15,970 --> 00:53:23,020
All that's looked at in this and this is where I train professional does that we also do client history so that means a personal history.

586
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:28,120
You know what is your background? Who do you live with? Do you have children, you know, your living situation,

587
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:33,940
but then also your medical history and your health history and then your family history as well, because that plays a part.

588
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:40,269
We all know genetics and then also social. So, you know, socioeconomic status where they're at.

589
00:53:40,270 --> 00:53:46,719
So you get a big picture. And so all of this is kind of like I said, it's a little bit easier to do.

590
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:49,780
We're not doing a diet recall. We're not doing that. These are the other components.

591
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:54,130
And so for today, our focus is that first one, that food and nutrition related history.

592
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:57,820
So really, what are we looking at diet wise?

593
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:05,350
And so when we're looking at that food nutrition related history, there's a lot of different components that we want to gather from them.

594
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:10,690
The first one out there, the food and nutrient intake, that's where our diet recalls kind of fall in.

595
00:54:11,260 --> 00:54:14,799
You know, what are we eating? But more is involved in that.

596
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:19,090
You know, in the research setting, it might be simple to see, does this diet that we're giving them,

597
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:23,350
are they following it, or is this intervention successful in the clinical setting?

598
00:54:23,590 --> 00:54:26,739
We need to look at the whole big picture as a practitioner.

599
00:54:26,740 --> 00:54:29,770
So we need that intake, but we need everything else with it.

600
00:54:30,130 --> 00:54:38,110
Things like the diet history, what medications, what complementary and alternative medicine they might be using their food and nutrition,

601
00:54:38,110 --> 00:54:44,230
knowledge, beliefs and behaviors, which I'll talk about more in a minute, their physical activity and exercise and also their food availability.

602
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:45,760
So this paints the whole bag.

603
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:52,150
I just kind of it kind of their food picture because those other domains are a lot less related to food, but this is all related to food.

604
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:58,960
And so the focus for today is that food and nutrient intake, like I said, what are we doing for this diet recall?

605
00:54:59,530 --> 00:55:03,970
But hand-in-hand with that is this knowledge, beliefs and behaviors.

606
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:09,850
So we can take a diet recall. But it really doesn't mean, Jack, you know, as a practitioner, unless we kind of get the big picture.

607
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:15,670
So things that fall into here are going to be things like appetite, chewing and swallowing difficulties,

608
00:55:16,210 --> 00:55:23,680
difficulties they might have with food prep, be it due to physical or economic reasons, food intolerances and allergies.

609
00:55:23,950 --> 00:55:27,459
What their actual meal pattern looks like. Like we said, we don't want to call it breakfast.

610
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:31,720
We say, What was the first time you had something to eat or drink? Everyone has a different meal pattern.

611
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:41,710
Dietary restrictions due to religious reasons or ethnic reasons, alcohol consumption, frequency and types of foods away from home.

612
00:55:41,950 --> 00:55:46,029
They someone who eats out a lot or not just doing a diary call might not reveal that.

613
00:55:46,030 --> 00:55:49,660
So you need to know also their attitude regarding their diet and their health.

614
00:55:50,350 --> 00:55:53,500
Previous diet instruction. Have they met with an hour before or have they not?

615
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:57,280
Are they following some diet that they read on a blog? You know, what's going on there?

616
00:55:57,490 --> 00:56:03,520
And then also their stage of change. So that's something you definitely talk about in counseling a lot if you do the internship.

617
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:05,410
I do a lot of that in the I rotation.

618
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:11,020
We really want to know where are they at on the stage of change because a lot of this won't even matter if they're not ready for that change.

619
00:56:12,010 --> 00:56:17,050
So this I you know, I just wanted to point out that one, you know, it's that smaller, you know, less defined box because.

620
00:56:17,390 --> 00:56:21,020
It's not the focus for today, but it's also very important it goes hand-in-hand with this.

621
00:56:22,070 --> 00:56:27,040
So when we're doing this food and nutrition related history, when we're getting all of this, really, what is the goal?

622
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:30,770
And it's very similar to what Sarah talks about. You know, why do we do this stuff in the counseling?

623
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:36,499
One, we want to identify their intake and their imbalances were really what's going in, what's going out.

624
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:43,400
We want to know what's going on. We also want to identify any reasons for food, food and nutrition related problems.

625
00:56:43,670 --> 00:56:50,450
So that's kind of your goal, right? If they're coming to you for any kind of counseling or any kind of help, be it in-patient outpatient setting,

626
00:56:50,660 --> 00:56:53,660
you know, there's probably going to be some kind of problem and you want to know why.

627
00:56:53,870 --> 00:56:57,260
You know, it doesn't help to just know what the problem is. You need to know why, so you can fix it.

628
00:56:57,830 --> 00:57:04,430
And then also identify all dietary factors important in generating the nutrition diagnosis and the subsequent intervention.

629
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:08,059
So this is a big thing with dietetics. We follow the eight item format.

630
00:57:08,060 --> 00:57:12,650
You do an assessment, a diagnosis intervention, an intervention monitoring and evaluation.

631
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:16,820
So that 18 process, you cannot make the diagnosis unless you know what's going on.

632
00:57:17,090 --> 00:57:20,960
So you cannot do your job and make your statement unless you have this.

633
00:57:21,410 --> 00:57:28,969
So that's why we do this. This is why we need to gather all this information and so we know why we're doing it.

634
00:57:28,970 --> 00:57:31,310
And now we're going to certainly about how do we do it.

635
00:57:31,310 --> 00:57:36,530
So in these different clinical settings, these are the best little pictures on Google for this.

636
00:57:37,190 --> 00:57:41,720
But the main things we deal with clinically are going to be this inpatient, outpatient and skilled nursing.

637
00:57:42,050 --> 00:57:45,860
These are kind of our three focus when we're talking about working with clients.

638
00:57:45,860 --> 00:57:49,909
And, you know, if your focus is more community, that's going to be your outpatient inpatients,

639
00:57:49,910 --> 00:57:56,750
the hospital setting skilled nursing is skilled nursing, long term care, the continuing care communities is really what we're calling them now.

640
00:57:57,380 --> 00:58:05,540
So it's going to vary. So if you're in the inpatient setting, clearly what Sarah talked about, you are not going to be able to do a 24 hour recall,

641
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:08,930
someone who's on a ventilator with a tube down their throat in the ICU.

642
00:58:09,410 --> 00:58:14,510
You're not going to be able to do what their family members. You're going to go to their chart and see what we fed them through enteral nutrition.

643
00:58:14,510 --> 00:58:16,550
So there's definitely different ways of obtaining this.

644
00:58:16,940 --> 00:58:24,499
So in the inpatient setting that comprehensive history is not going to be possible or really needed, you know, it's a very acute care setting.

645
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:29,360
They might be there a couple of days, stays in. Hospitals are very short compared to what they used to be.

646
00:58:29,630 --> 00:58:33,470
Even when I did my internship. I mean, people would be there for weeks now. They're there for like three days.

647
00:58:33,830 --> 00:58:38,930
And so it might literally be you're popping into a room. Someone has a new diagnosis of diabetes.

648
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:43,070
You're not going to do this whole recall and this whole education with them.

649
00:58:43,070 --> 00:58:48,979
It's a much more acute thing. So really you're just going to do certain components and this is stuff you would learn later on in practice.

650
00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:52,640
But, you know, what are you really looking at? You're not going to be able to do a big recall with them.

651
00:58:53,510 --> 00:58:58,640
And if you are, you're going to gather that information from their chart, talking to their nurse,

652
00:58:58,820 --> 00:59:02,960
maybe calling the diet office where they're placing their food orders from and seeing what they've been ordering.

653
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:08,030
So that kind of stuff, the outpatient and skilled nursing, however you can,

654
00:59:08,030 --> 00:59:13,430
you can do a very comprehensive, a very thorough collection of all their different food data.

655
00:59:13,730 --> 00:59:16,490
And it depends on your setting, you know, is it a one and done.

656
00:59:16,490 --> 00:59:22,100
They're coming into the community clinic for some resources and you're just going to give them some paperwork, kind of gather some information.

657
00:59:22,430 --> 00:59:26,120
Are they in an outpatient clinic and you're going to see them every three weeks for a year?

658
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:29,959
You know, everything is going to be different. Skilled nursing, save the long term care.

659
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:33,320
They live there. You're living with them. You're coming into their home every single day.

660
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:39,320
So you can really work with them on this so that those two settings, you really can gather a lot more information.

661
00:59:40,970 --> 00:59:44,660
So what are different ways of doing this? So what are kind of different recalls?

662
00:59:44,660 --> 00:59:51,110
We can do so. And I know Sue talks about I think everyone that I've mentioned here are that you either have learned about or you will learn about.

663
00:59:51,410 --> 00:59:57,530
So one is the food frequency question or the five. Q This is used a lot, especially in research.

664
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:03,740
So I will say this one is not really used in clinical practice very much and you'll see why, you know, as we're talking about it.

665
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:09,559
But this is just kind of an idea of what it looks like. You know, over the past 12 months, how often did you do this?

666
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:18,530
And then each time how much did you have? And so it really requires a lot of recall and hopefully accuracy, which is not always obtainable.

667
01:00:18,860 --> 01:00:23,059
But look look at us. The last 12 months, so much has shifted. We're living through a pandemic.

668
01:00:23,060 --> 01:00:26,840
So everything has changed so much. You know, think of 2022 now.

669
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:33,500
And so, you know, we've gone from mostly virtual to in-person and then back and forth for several people, things that are very different.

670
01:00:33,860 --> 01:00:38,420
So, you know, it is it's a retrospective method. You know, we're looking back in time to do this.

671
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:44,059
You know, it is great because you can you know, you can get really long term intake.

672
01:00:44,060 --> 01:00:49,910
So we're talking about deficiencies or excesses. You can look and see, okay, over time, this is what their diet looks like.

673
01:00:49,910 --> 01:00:54,979
This is what they're consuming. You can see, are they avoiding major categories as we're going through this?

674
01:00:54,980 --> 01:00:57,860
And you'll be like, wow, there are no vegetables anywhere in here,

675
01:00:58,070 --> 01:01:02,810
or someone who is maybe vegetarian or vegan like, wow, we're really not getting any protein.

676
01:01:03,020 --> 01:01:07,640
This can really help with that. But you know, it's definitely more applicable to the research setting.

677
01:01:07,670 --> 01:01:10,670
You could do this, say you have your own outpatient practice.

678
01:01:10,910 --> 01:01:15,680
You could do this with some of your clients. But, you know, it is it is low burden.

679
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:19,510
It is low cost. But like I said, it was really good memory.

680
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:22,720
Literacy and numeracy in your clients or your patients.

681
01:01:23,410 --> 01:01:27,190
And so, you know, we had questions about like, you know, different ethnic or cross-cultural.

682
01:01:27,460 --> 01:01:31,150
This doesn't always apply because if it's not in your questionnaire, you're not going to obtain that information.

683
01:01:31,450 --> 01:01:37,690
So if you have a very, very Americanized version of this, which most of them are, you're going to miss a lot of data that you could gather.

684
01:01:40,450 --> 01:01:47,080
So, you know, kind of my takeaway on this one is, yes, this is great, but in the clinical setting, you're not really going to see it used very much.

685
01:01:47,380 --> 01:01:50,260
We do have short forms of this. They have a short fuze.

686
01:01:50,260 --> 01:01:57,040
You can kind of do a screeners or kind of like to check in and that's something you could develop on your own or their standardized ones out there.

687
01:01:57,340 --> 01:02:03,880
Those would be a little bit more applicable. But like I said, it's still very time consuming to think about the time to go through.

688
01:02:03,910 --> 01:02:11,170
Typically, these cover about 100 foods. And so you are having that person think about this for 100 different foods.

689
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:17,510
And it's a lot I will say I filled these out before working in research with different stuff and it's you done about a quarter of the way through.

690
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:21,610
You really don't want to keep moving forward. So that's the RFQ.

691
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:26,620
The other one that I are an excellent I want to talk about is like food records or food diaries, food journals.

692
01:02:26,830 --> 01:02:31,630
This is your typical like what people think about when we talk about gathering food information.

693
01:02:32,290 --> 01:02:36,070
So I just use an example, you know, a lot of people, you know, food, diaries and they look like this.

694
01:02:36,130 --> 01:02:40,690
They tell you what the meal is. And then what did you have? How much how did you prepare it?

695
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:46,180
They might ask, like, what was your mood? What was your attitude? Were you say, you know, how hungry were you?

696
01:02:46,180 --> 01:02:49,870
How satiated did you get? They can get very detailed or they could be very general.

697
01:02:50,590 --> 01:02:54,880
So this is, like I said, very, very, very common in its prospective.

698
01:02:54,910 --> 01:03:00,850
So it's in the moment. So it is nice. You don't need to have memory, but you do need to remember to do it.

699
01:03:01,180 --> 01:03:03,950
And I will say, if anyone has done this or tracked anything, you know,

700
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:09,969
through apps on your phone or like I'm an athlete, so like tracking my runs, that's why I have this guy now.

701
01:03:09,970 --> 01:03:12,460
So I don't have to think about it, otherwise I wouldn't do it.

702
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:20,769
And so you have to remember when you're doing these things, so you are relying on that type of memory and it's really nice.

703
01:03:20,770 --> 01:03:24,430
Like Sara talked about, you don't have multiple passes like you do in a 24 hour recall.

704
01:03:24,770 --> 01:03:31,800
It's done. It's done in the moment. They're able to do it. So it is a good estimate of short term intake, you know, because you're not doing it long.

705
01:03:31,810 --> 01:03:38,200
If you want to have them do it for several days, it's going to become way too big of a burden and a really low completion rate.

706
01:03:38,590 --> 01:03:47,139
I will say working in the outpatient setting, you know, I did different group classes and we wanted them to track their do a food journal,

707
01:03:47,140 --> 01:03:53,620
literally like the entire 12 week process and by a couple of weeks and no one was doing it because that's just unrealistic for a lot of people.

708
01:03:53,630 --> 01:03:55,660
Some people, that's what they want to do. They will do it.

709
01:03:56,020 --> 01:04:02,470
But most and then we made it optional after that, we weren't like, this isn't this isn't realistic because it's just too much of a burden.

710
01:04:03,730 --> 01:04:12,730
Another big weakness is there is a lot of reactivity because if they know someone's going to see this or look at this, they're going to lie.

711
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:16,989
They're going to omit things. They're going to be like, Yes, I had three cups of greens with that meal.

712
01:04:16,990 --> 01:04:21,160
You know, they had a quarter cup because there's always that desire to please, unfortunately.

713
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:25,330
And that, you know, Sara mentioned rapport, you know, the same thing.

714
01:04:25,330 --> 01:04:30,490
Obviously in the clinical setting, you really want that rapport and get them to feel comfortable saying,

715
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:35,590
Yeah, my diet was crap this past week, but I'm going to be real because you're here to help me with it.

716
01:04:36,220 --> 01:04:43,030
So you do get a lot of bias, a lot of reactivity, and it is a high burden to review as the practitioner.

717
01:04:43,420 --> 01:04:46,329
Even if the client really loves doing these and you want to look over it.

718
01:04:46,330 --> 01:04:52,899
It is a lot of work to look through these things and really, especially if you're looking for specific nutrients, that's going to be a lot.

719
01:04:52,900 --> 01:04:59,049
If you want to import them into a database, it's a lot like and ESR we have that capability of putting in the food recall and stuff.

720
01:04:59,050 --> 01:05:04,000
But then did they give you enough information in that to be able to answer all those detailed questions?

721
01:05:04,930 --> 01:05:08,950
So like I said, this one is good. It definitely is used in clinical settings.

722
01:05:08,950 --> 01:05:11,290
Like I said, in an outpatient clinic, you can have them.

723
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:16,780
A lot of places require track the last three days before you come to my appointment and that's great.

724
01:05:16,780 --> 01:05:22,270
But it's still it's a high burden, but you're going to use it more in that outpatient setting,

725
01:05:22,510 --> 01:05:26,200
not even the skilled nursing, because most of those in that setting aren't able to do this.

726
01:05:26,860 --> 01:05:30,220
And you're able to talk to the dining staff and everybody about these questions,

727
01:05:30,790 --> 01:05:34,330
but you are really going to use it in the outpatient, really when a deep dive is warranted.

728
01:05:34,570 --> 01:05:38,049
That's what I would use as personally, you know, only if it's like, man,

729
01:05:38,050 --> 01:05:42,430
we have tried this intervention and that intervention and nothing is seeming to quite hit home here.

730
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:47,470
Then I might tell my patient, you know what? Over the next month, if you could record, you know,

731
01:05:47,470 --> 01:05:53,740
a week making sure you get a weekend and a week days in there and then come back to me and maybe we can identify what's going on.

732
01:05:53,890 --> 01:05:55,870
That's when this is going to be very, very helpful.

733
01:05:57,810 --> 01:06:05,190
And then 25 I recall this I stole from one of the ones I've done in India, SA, because it was the shortest one I could get on there.

734
01:06:05,820 --> 01:06:09,000
But that's what it looks like when we're done and you know, kind of that output of doing it.

735
01:06:09,010 --> 01:06:16,700
So don't want to reiterate everything Sara said, but you know, it's retrospective, obviously relies on memory and a trained professional.

736
01:06:16,710 --> 01:06:21,030
You really need a trained professional doing this because you have to learn the multitask system.

737
01:06:21,030 --> 01:06:25,020
You have to learn how to be neutral and ask the questions in the right way.

738
01:06:25,740 --> 01:06:32,280
So this can be really great, especially in research, but clinically you can see, you know, what Sara was happy about.

739
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:35,069
This isn't really going to be possible in that clinical setting.

740
01:06:35,070 --> 01:06:40,649
You know, if I have someone in my office as an outpatient dietitian, I don't want to make it very formal as we're doing this.

741
01:06:40,650 --> 01:06:45,270
I want to be informal. I want to keep it to develop that rapport and to keep it just kind of really real.

742
01:06:46,650 --> 01:06:51,210
You know, obviously, memory is an issue, but especially challenging when dealing with really young,

743
01:06:51,420 --> 01:06:55,320
elderly or disabled because this can be really hard for them to do.

744
01:06:56,790 --> 01:07:00,660
They also have a lot of reactivity as well. You don't want them to, but they can.

745
01:07:01,050 --> 01:07:06,240
Even if you make that very neutral, no pressure, they still are like, Oh, I'm talking to a professional here.

746
01:07:06,420 --> 01:07:09,659
So they might kind of fudge a little bit on what they ate.

747
01:07:09,660 --> 01:07:14,700
And, you know, that also doesn't really help. So mostly in research here.

748
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:18,180
So those are the three I wanted to talk about because those are the three kind of you hear.

749
01:07:18,180 --> 01:07:21,720
Most common is a dietitian. So really, what do we do in practice?

750
01:07:22,230 --> 01:07:30,060
None of those and kind of all of those, we modify it. So kind of what I call it is a modified 24 hour recall is commonly used.

751
01:07:30,270 --> 01:07:32,520
And really it just takes a lot of practice.

752
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:37,680
You know, a lot of people's first job is not in an outpatient clinic because you kind of develop these skills as you go.

753
01:07:38,010 --> 01:07:42,989
But when you're there, you really create your own dietary recall in clinical practice.

754
01:07:42,990 --> 01:07:49,590
And, you know, are you in a hospital? So do you see people in the ICU or you're never going to do this or are you on the floor?

755
01:07:49,620 --> 01:07:52,710
So you see people after surgery and they're mostly on clear, full liquids.

756
01:07:52,950 --> 01:07:57,660
You know, there'll be a really quick recall to do. And so you could ask them and like, how are you tolerating the food?

757
01:07:57,900 --> 01:08:01,080
Very different. But in the outpatient setting, you would definitely do this.

758
01:08:01,090 --> 01:08:05,490
You know, and really what I would do is say, you know, we're going to kind of do a 24 hour recall here,

759
01:08:05,730 --> 01:08:09,840
but, you know, and just kind of ask them the same kind of questions like Sarah was talking about.

760
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:14,370
But we do it much more in general, much more kind of fun, lackadaisical when we're doing it.

761
01:08:15,180 --> 01:08:17,940
We're not using a five pass method we're going through once, you know,

762
01:08:17,970 --> 01:08:21,510
and I'm not going to review it in the end and say, okay, well, you gave me all this information.

763
01:08:21,810 --> 01:08:24,060
It's literally, okay, let's just talk about what you eat yesterday.

764
01:08:24,060 --> 01:08:27,719
I just kind of want to get a general idea what a day looks like for you and use make it

765
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:32,250
very open and welcoming and you can get some of the information from previous notes,

766
01:08:32,250 --> 01:08:36,540
from charts, from seniors, nurses, diet office records.

767
01:08:37,110 --> 01:08:39,390
You can take this from a lot of other places too.

768
01:08:40,770 --> 01:08:45,360
And so in the outpatient setting, like I said, it's completed as part of your motivational interview,

769
01:08:45,840 --> 01:08:50,489
you know, we really put a lot on them during a motivational interview, but you do need to get some background.

770
01:08:50,490 --> 01:08:55,319
And this is something that you work on as you're developing your interview skills because you do really want to throw it in there and say,

771
01:08:55,320 --> 01:09:01,110
okay, well, so this is what we want to learn about. Well, let me let me ask you, you know, what is your typical day look like?

772
01:09:01,350 --> 01:09:06,839
So you might ask a typical day instead of the true 24 hour recall, because they might be like, you know, well, yesterday was Thanksgiving.

773
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:13,499
So I really do want to talk about that one. But or yesterday, you know, I've had this before doing 24 hour recalls like, well,

774
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:16,560
I was traveling from Japan yesterday, so I was on all these flights and stuff.

775
01:09:16,860 --> 01:09:21,420
Okay, so that's not going to be a good day to do that. But in the clinical setting, you could say, okay, well, scratch yesterday.

776
01:09:21,630 --> 01:09:24,540
What do you normally do then, you know, and how did you make yesterday work?

777
01:09:24,690 --> 01:09:29,700
Because then you could really see how are they, you know, in spur of the moment with things like I mentioned,

778
01:09:29,700 --> 01:09:33,600
this has to be combined with the other components of the food nutrition related history.

779
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:37,680
I could ask you what you ate yesterday, but as a practitioner, that's not going to help me.

780
01:09:37,830 --> 01:09:41,910
I need to know how to treat you. You know, with yesterday. Great. But you're like, really?

781
01:09:42,150 --> 01:09:46,020
I normally hit McDonald's for breakfast, Burger King for lunch and talk about for dinner yesterday.

782
01:09:46,020 --> 01:09:49,920
I was home because I was sick, you know, so you really need to learn all that information.

783
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:56,850
So especially like I said, the food, food and nutrition, knowledge, beliefs and behaviors are really needed,

784
01:09:56,850 --> 01:10:01,139
plus the other domains because you need to look at their anthropometric or their biochemical.

785
01:10:01,140 --> 01:10:04,440
What are their lab showing in relation to this and all that kind of stuff?

786
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:11,520
I need to get a general understanding of diet, whereas a 24 hour recall, we are getting a very precise this is what the diet,

787
01:10:11,670 --> 01:10:14,700
but we want a very general understanding to be able to help our patients.

788
01:10:16,530 --> 01:10:21,210
And you really use us to identify trends, to identify patterns like we talked about in the beginning.

789
01:10:21,390 --> 01:10:25,380
And like I said, that major category avoidance, this is a really easy way.

790
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:32,100
You know, after doing these a lot in clinical practice, you go through and you're like, I notice you didn't have any fruit yesterday.

791
01:10:32,310 --> 01:10:36,090
You know, I've seen this with a lot of patients and they'll be like, Well, yeah, I'm really not. It's too sweet for me.

792
01:10:36,090 --> 01:10:40,110
I prefer vegetables. That's great. But at the same time, you know, we have benefits to fruit.

793
01:10:40,530 --> 01:10:45,900
So, you know, and you were able to pull that out or, you know, same thing or you might not notice a lot of beverages.

794
01:10:45,910 --> 01:10:49,110
And he'd say, Well, did you have anything to drink? That's actually I've been working on that.

795
01:10:49,110 --> 01:10:56,280
I had about a half a cup of water and that's it. You would be surprised the number of people who don't touch water in a day, they do not touch water.

796
01:10:56,490 --> 01:11:01,390
And it. They might be coffee. And then they switched to Pepsi. And then at night they go to their caffeine free Diet Pepsi.

797
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:05,890
You know, that's what a typical day looks like for so many, you know, in the American culture of that.

798
01:11:06,610 --> 01:11:10,960
But this is going to help you find that. And then it should be client.

799
01:11:12,070 --> 01:11:15,670
Oh, sorry. Yes. And then can contradict other information provided by client.

800
01:11:16,150 --> 01:11:20,320
You will catch them in lies if you ask them. Do you normally eat out now?

801
01:11:20,350 --> 01:11:23,739
No. No, I never eat out. Well, if you do, where did you go? Oh, you know, normally sit down.

802
01:11:23,740 --> 01:11:29,620
I will never hit fast food. Then you do a 24 hour recall, this modified one, and they're like, Yeah, I had McDonalds for lunch.

803
01:11:29,710 --> 01:11:33,370
And you can call them out and say like, Well, you said you never eat fast food, but you did yesterday.

804
01:11:33,970 --> 01:11:38,380
Now you know what? Actually, I guess I do it more than that or yesterday with an anomaly,

805
01:11:38,590 --> 01:11:43,180
but you can catch them in those contradictions or, you know, just like you always cook from scratch.

806
01:11:43,180 --> 01:11:47,260
But yesterday everything was out of a can or a box, you know. So what a scratch mean to them.

807
01:11:47,350 --> 01:11:52,179
It might be very different. So, you know, I say that, you know, you catch their contradictions,

808
01:11:52,180 --> 01:11:56,920
but with practice comes the ability to call them out on it in a nice way and just be like, hey, let's talk about that.

809
01:11:57,490 --> 01:11:59,830
Should be client led, just like that 24 hour recall.

810
01:11:59,830 --> 01:12:05,730
You don't want to introduce bias, so I am not going to sit there, be like, what did you have for breakfast and what did you have for lunch?

811
01:12:05,740 --> 01:12:07,930
I say, What was the first thing you had to eat or drink?

812
01:12:08,230 --> 01:12:11,770
You know, which really helped when I did the Andy Serwer training, because I had was already used to that.

813
01:12:11,770 --> 01:12:16,839
We don't want to assume meals. I worked with a lot of third shifters when I worked at the VA.

814
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:20,049
And so I really had to be like, okay, when do you eat?

815
01:12:20,050 --> 01:12:26,650
When do you drink? What are your breaks look like? Because a lot of them eat like eight meals a day because of shift work and how this is looking.

816
01:12:27,250 --> 01:12:33,850
So really letting them lead it and tell you what their diets like reactivity can occur and should be addressed.

817
01:12:34,030 --> 01:12:38,620
So developing that rapport and I tell any of them that when I'm working with them, look,

818
01:12:38,620 --> 01:12:44,049
there's no point in lying to me if you lie to me and tell me you have this perfect diet, why are you here today?

819
01:12:44,050 --> 01:12:47,200
I can't help you. So be honest with me. I'm not going to judge.

820
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:50,860
I really don't care. I just need to know your baseline so I can fix it.

821
01:12:51,220 --> 01:12:55,120
You know, like I said, no judgment allowed. You really made that clear. Like, I am not going to judge you.

822
01:12:55,180 --> 01:12:58,390
I really don't care. I've seen the best and the worse. It does not matter.

823
01:12:58,840 --> 01:13:00,400
Just tell me the truth and then we can help.

824
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:06,130
And then, you know, that last bullet is, you know, just can be a specific or generalize is needed for the client.

825
01:13:06,490 --> 01:13:12,309
Maybe they're a typo and they have type one diabetes and they've had this for several years and all of a sudden their agency is out of control,

826
01:13:12,310 --> 01:13:16,450
their insulin is way up, they can't figure out what's going on. You are going to be specific.

827
01:13:16,450 --> 01:13:20,559
You are going to figure out what is going on. Someone's coming in for general weight loss.

828
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:24,190
They feel pretty good. You know, doctor recommended it. They're here. We're going to start.

829
01:13:24,190 --> 01:13:27,309
Really, General, just what does your diet look like? So it really depends.

830
01:13:27,310 --> 01:13:30,960
And really client focused. It's almost 1115.

831
01:13:31,030 --> 01:13:32,410
Okay, take a break.

832
01:13:34,510 --> 01:13:41,380
And so, you know, kind of to sum that all up, so nutrition assessment, you know, as you learn throughout this class, it's multifactorial.

833
01:13:41,410 --> 01:13:45,820
There are several things that go into this, you know, be it in the research or the clinical setting,

834
01:13:46,510 --> 01:13:50,170
that food and nutrient intake is one part of it and it's very much needed.

835
01:13:50,860 --> 01:13:54,790
There are numerous ways to obtain a dietary recall in different clinical settings,

836
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:59,139
and ultimately the diet recall is obtained using the artist's Russian.

837
01:13:59,140 --> 01:14:03,970
You know, we take all this, we learn about all of it, and then you go into practice and you use what works best for you.

838
01:14:05,560 --> 01:14:08,650
So kind of short, sweet there at the end. But does anyone have any questions?

839
01:14:09,850 --> 01:14:12,950
Yes. This honestly.

840
01:14:13,450 --> 01:14:19,930
Yes. So, I mean, are we just read like an article about how closely has it changed?

841
01:14:20,230 --> 01:14:25,700
And obviously going to be a little bit more on this if they're in that like pre 13?

842
01:14:26,380 --> 01:14:35,170
Correct. Is it worth kind of like kind of making them feel bad about themselves if they're kind of not if they're doing it well,

843
01:14:35,180 --> 01:14:39,790
they're not in a state of trust and so do want to that pre contemplation.

844
01:14:39,940 --> 01:14:44,710
I wouldn't even attempt a diet recall so we wouldn't even get there. You know, it would just be very much, why are you here?

845
01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:48,970
Well, my doctor, Mimi, my wife, made me come and I'd been there for that and it's not fun.

846
01:14:49,210 --> 01:14:52,420
And you're just like, okay, this will be a great five minute appointment,

847
01:14:53,170 --> 01:14:56,830
but you just really take a step back and you just you develop rapport at that point.

848
01:14:57,040 --> 01:15:00,429
So I would never get to the diet. We call in less.

849
01:15:00,430 --> 01:15:05,770
We're more at the contemplation or preparation stage, but every contemplation, you're just like, Hey, let's be friends.

850
01:15:06,340 --> 01:15:10,240
Like, don't be afraid of a dietician. It's okay to be here. And so you really work on that.

851
01:15:10,450 --> 01:15:15,279
So you would never even get to that point, really more preparation is where you're going to do more of that and be like,

852
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:21,590
Let's just be honest, tell me what's going on, because they're ready for that change and they want to be honest with you and just seems like,

853
01:15:22,150 --> 01:15:25,180
I guess like I'm going to work on like eating fast food.

854
01:15:25,180 --> 01:15:34,030
Like at what point is it like not agree to like demonize that kind of food because yeah, in the day like to go to better.

855
01:15:34,030 --> 01:15:35,049
So exactly.

856
01:15:35,050 --> 01:15:40,420
And I would just always tell them like I just need to know some people have busy lifestyles and they can't eat at home, so they're always eating out.

857
01:15:40,660 --> 01:15:43,330
So, you know, do you eat out a lot? What types of places?

858
01:15:43,330 --> 01:15:49,570
Because then we can help you make better choices or say we're managing diabetes like, you know, especially making better choices while we're out.

859
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:53,620
And then the difference would just be if they're like, I never eat out. And then they do.

860
01:15:53,620 --> 01:15:56,290
And it's like, Well, I just need to know because we need to know how to best help.

861
01:15:56,770 --> 01:16:01,900
And so just really taking that approach of like eat out all you want, but we just need to make sure you're choosing right when you do so.

862
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:06,730
Mm hmm. Is it appropriate to what kind of connection to, like, oh.

863
01:16:06,730 --> 01:16:10,060
Oh, like, that's also my favorite restaurant. And also, they kind of open up.

864
01:16:10,090 --> 01:16:16,059
Oh, yeah. You know, and you'll talk more about that and counseling, like self-disclosure and stuff.

865
01:16:16,060 --> 01:16:20,740
But I'm always okay with a little bit of self-disclosure as long as you are comfortable as a practitioner,

866
01:16:20,830 --> 01:16:25,690
if you are comfortable sharing something and you're not lying and you're just not making it about you,

867
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:29,380
but if you feel that's going to make that rapport strong, be like, Oh my God, I love to go there.

868
01:16:29,560 --> 01:16:34,000
You might have a 32nd CI chat. They trust you more, and now you're going to get more information.

869
01:16:34,300 --> 01:16:38,740
So I am all about develop that rapport, be open and real, and be like, yes,

870
01:16:38,740 --> 01:16:43,360
I may be a dietitian, but I like, you know, I'm not 100% healthy all the time.

871
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:49,390
You know, what is healthy even mean. Know and so being very real with them about that and then that's that's the goal in the end.

872
01:16:51,680 --> 01:16:55,900
Anything else? All right?

873
01:16:56,560 --> 01:16:59,650
I don't know. All right.

874
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:02,800
Well, Sarah and Jessica, thank you so much.

875
01:17:02,980 --> 01:17:10,440
This has been wonderful. And so two things.

876
01:17:11,790 --> 01:17:17,520
You have a homework that is going to be live by 1130 today.

877
01:17:19,620 --> 01:17:28,950
This is a follow up to what was covered today. So the homework assignment is to go in to assay to for most or many of you are familiar.

878
01:17:29,460 --> 01:17:33,090
The homework assignment has the link. It has the little instructions.

879
01:17:33,240 --> 01:17:45,450
We talked about it on Tuesday is a to poor is the computerized self automated thank you by the automated 24 hour recall.

880
01:17:45,870 --> 01:17:50,340
What I'd like you to do is to go in and.

881
01:17:51,440 --> 01:18:00,110
Get a recall on yourself. But I want you to think about it in the context of having heard about learned about the interviewer approach.

882
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:07,220
Compare the interview approach that Sarah walked you through with the ACA to four self-administered.

883
01:18:07,550 --> 01:18:16,220
So this is not so much about you collecting your diet as it is thinking about the process and think about it in the in the context of what

884
01:18:16,220 --> 01:18:25,459
would this be like for a client or an outpatient or a community member who might be participating in some community based research project?

885
01:18:25,460 --> 01:18:37,190
Or maybe there might be a community program and they have that dietary collection as part of the program evaluation.

886
01:18:37,610 --> 01:18:44,410
So as you go through the process and ACA to core,

887
01:18:44,510 --> 01:18:52,520
think about what it would be like for the layperson to take time to just read what the questions are.

888
01:18:52,550 --> 01:18:57,110
It's just a series of there's a reflection question. Most of them are kind of reflection questions.

889
01:18:57,260 --> 01:19:03,320
Make sure you read all of them so that you don't answer one of the questions in the first one, but just go through.

890
01:19:03,770 --> 01:19:07,340
And I think beyond that, it's pretty self-explanatory.

891
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:17,240
It's a helpful exercise. And students in the past have said, you know, it was nice to think about, oh, interviewer approach versus this automated.

892
01:19:17,930 --> 01:19:26,600
The last thing that I wanted to bring up is we're very tight in here when we have everybody.

893
01:19:27,230 --> 01:19:30,469
So I reached out or Carol reached out to the registrar,

894
01:19:30,470 --> 01:19:35,930
and our two options are to get a classroom on central campus, which I said, no, that does not work.

895
01:19:37,010 --> 01:19:42,860
The second option and is that we could be in two different classrooms,

896
01:19:43,230 --> 01:19:48,860
two states would be in one auditorium over in page one, 1690, which is a nice auditorium.

897
01:19:49,370 --> 01:19:53,120
And on Thursdays, we would be over here in the big auditorium.

898
01:19:54,220 --> 01:20:00,340
I had to conduct a class like this about five years ago, and once we got used to it, it was no problem.

899
01:20:00,580 --> 01:20:03,940
So Tuesdays the class is in one, Thursdays it's in another.

900
01:20:04,180 --> 01:20:07,899
If you guys are okay with that, I just feel like we kind of have to do it.

901
01:20:07,900 --> 01:20:19,389
Do it. Well, let me just say, the registrar gave the caveat that he has to make sure that the larger classes are set for the semester.

902
01:20:19,390 --> 01:20:26,320
So we're not going to get assigned that option until he's comfortable that the larger classes,

903
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:30,850
because we're basically taking out two different classrooms that are actually for larger classes.

904
01:20:31,150 --> 01:20:35,790
So I'm hoping that works. But I told Carol to go ahead and option two.

905
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:39,790
So as soon as we find out, hopefully that'll work.

906
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:51,159
On Tuesday, we're going to talk about food frequency questionnaires and diet history and we'll continue what we don't finish on Tuesday,

907
01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:54,760
on Thursday, so we can have a good rest of the week and weekend.

908
01:20:55,420 --> 01:20:59,860
So. Yeah.

909
01:20:59,980 --> 01:21:01,710
Because we don't have we haven't been assigned.
