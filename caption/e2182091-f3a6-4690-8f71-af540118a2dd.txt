1
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:08,150
Ambulance Bay. Hey, everybody.

2
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:13,280
Welcome to our sorely diminished class today.

3
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:19,010
I know a few folks are out sick, and I suspect a few more are sick for Thanksgiving break.

4
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:25,880
Understood. So I appreciate all of you hardcore folks sticking with me here in the Thanksgiving break week.

5
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:35,030
So as I mentioned last time, at the end of our noise, I'll put that in air quotes to our lab and thanks for the feedback on that.

6
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:40,879
We've now concluded our noise focused portion of the course and we're going to shift for

7
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:45,380
the next three lectures and talk about some other physical hazards that are important.

8
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:49,549
And so today we're going to spend some time talking about human vibration,

9
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:54,080
which comes in two varieties, basically whole body and hand arm, as I'll talk about.

10
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:58,580
And for both of these today is the competencies are I want you guys to understand or you

11
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:03,260
all to understand sort of one of the sources of vibration that people might be exposed to.

12
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,370
What are the health effects associated with those exposures?

13
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:14,150
And then how can we actually control those exposures? So very consistent with the approach we've taken with all of our other physical hazards.

14
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:21,650
So this concept of human vibration, as I said, we can break this exposure up into two different kinds of vibration.

15
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:25,549
And the one we'll talk about first is so-called whole body vibration.

16
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:29,690
And these are pretty darn intuitive titles, which I am always a fan of.

17
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:38,030
So whole body vibration is just a vibration that's transmitted into our body and essentially transmitted through our entire body.

18
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:45,490
And so typically this is vibration that comes if we're seated in the seat that we're on is vibrating and a piece of heavy equipment,

19
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:52,610
a car, something along those lines. It's important to note that there can also be whole body vibration if you're standing.

20
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:56,089
So if any of you have ever stood on the deck of a ship, for instance,

21
00:01:56,090 --> 00:02:01,790
and you could sort of feel the vibration of the ship's engine, that's whole body vibration transmitted to your feet.

22
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:10,250
And then, of course, if you're lying down and again, this is maybe not such a common phenomenon, but if you're a sailor on a ship trying to sleep,

23
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:14,980
you're going to be lying down in that vibration that's transmitted to you through your entire backside.

24
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:21,559
It's in contact with the bed. So that's the first sort of half of our two types of human vibration.

25
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:29,720
And the second half is referred to variously as either segmental vibration or I'd say more commonly, hand arm vibration.

26
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:34,430
And so the idea here is this is vibration that isn't impacting your entire body.

27
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:39,829
It's coming into one of your body segments. And that segment is typically your hands or your arms.

28
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:42,170
So if you imagine using a vibrating tool,

29
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:49,430
you're typically going to be holding it with your hand in that vibration unless it's an extreme source is we'll talk about is

30
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:56,600
typically not going to travel much further up than your shoulder so we've got whole body vibration and we've got hand arm vibration.

31
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:05,450
And those are the two things we're going to focus on today. One thing that I've tried to impart where the statistics are available,

32
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:14,540
and so you can sort of get a sense of how common are these things is at least some estimates of the prevalence or how common this exposure is.

33
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:19,790
As is often the case, we don't have good data here in the United States.

34
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:28,909
And so we can look to to Western Europe, which has had directives for understanding and controlling exposure to both hand,

35
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:31,760
arm and whole body vibration now for close to 20 years.

36
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:38,089
And so we can look at in this table for different countries and for those of you who have traveled to Western Europe,

37
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:41,450
you know, it's a it's a big region. The countries sometimes can be quite small.

38
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:46,580
They're very close together, but they can be quite culturally, politically, socially distinct,

39
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:51,920
and they're certainly distinct as well when it comes to vibration exposure here.

40
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:57,979
And so these are estimates for all types of vibration exposure.

41
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:05,900
So whole body and hand arm. And you can see we've got this broken down by three different categories or sources of vibration.

42
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:16,579
And so, for instance, mobile machinery. And so this would include everything from a fork shock that someone might drive to logging vehicles,

43
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:19,760
construction equipment, even things like busses and trucks.

44
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:28,070
And so in Germany, the estimate is that potentially 5% of the workforce is exposed to human vibration.

45
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:35,420
You can see Spain and France are both around 10% and then Finland has a much higher fraction at 25%.

46
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:39,500
And so if you think about the economies of these countries, Germany,

47
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:47,600
Spain and France are all certainly robust big economies, lots of manufacturing going on there, lots of service work.

48
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:52,549
Finland is a much smaller country and it's much more focused on resource extraction.

49
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:54,620
So they have a huge forestry industry.

50
00:04:55,160 --> 00:05:02,270
And if any of you have ever had a chance to to see some of the equipment they use in forestry, the vibration levels they get can be pretty extreme.

51
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:08,070
So here's a case where four countries, all high income, well developed economies,

52
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:14,160
can have pretty substantial differences in terms of exposures to mobile machinery vibration.

53
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:17,760
The story is not quite so different when we get to hand tools.

54
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:22,530
So this again would be talking more about a hand arm vibration where the prevalence is somewhere between,

55
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:27,530
say, five and 11% across those countries and then stationary machinery.

56
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:35,919
So there are jobs out there where someone has an operator position that involves sitting basically on a piece of machinery that's vibrating,

57
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:42,720
but it's not a vehicle. It's doing something else. Those numbers are much smaller, so let's say between one and 3%.

58
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:52,350
And again, estimates aren't even available for Finland. So if we take Western Europe as an example, maybe of some of the conditions in the US,

59
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:58,379
we might think about states that are more manufacturing or service oriented,

60
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:02,490
having lower fractions of mobile machinery, vibration, exposure,

61
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:09,120
and then states where there's a big agricultural or forestry industry maybe having much higher exposure potential.

62
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:19,020
As I said, Europe is sort of leading the way, especially compared to America, where we have virtually no data on this exposure at all.

63
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:22,860
And so these are self-reported estimates.

64
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:30,120
So, you know, in industrial hygiene and environmental health in general, we always love to have data, measurement data, but we don't always have it.

65
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:40,410
So here this is surveys basically given to people asking them, are you exposed to vibration at work at least half of the time that you're working?

66
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:45,660
And you can see this survey was started back in 1986. So we've got ten years of data here.

67
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:52,079
It's broken up by men as the darker bar or the darker portion of the bar in women is the lighter portion.

68
00:06:52,080 --> 00:07:01,500
And you can see, in fact, that the fraction of women who are exposed to vibration at least half the time has been declining somewhat,

69
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,059
again, with just three data points.

70
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:10,889
Hard to make too much out of this, and the fraction of men who make up the vibration exposed population has been increasing slightly,

71
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:14,790
but otherwise no sort of substantial trends going on here.

72
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:16,820
So back in the nineties, you know,

73
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:24,270
there was maybe as many as one out of three people in the EU who might say they're exposed to vibration at least half the time.

74
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,410
And if we fast forward ten years, it's down to maybe 31%.

75
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:31,530
So no, again, huge temporal trends here.

76
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:38,280
We can also break down some of the types of exposures to more specific sources.

77
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:45,989
Again, we've got nothing like this in the United States, but here we're looking at the same four countries of Germany, Spain, France and Finland.

78
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:47,910
And to this we've now added Poland.

79
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:56,190
And so it's one thing to say, well, mobile machinery, there's 25% of the workers in Finland exposed from an occupational health perspective.

80
00:07:56,190 --> 00:08:01,200
That's not super helpful. You know, my interest is what where are they getting exposed?

81
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:05,610
Because once we identify that, then we have opportunities to intervene potentially.

82
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:11,070
And so you can see there's lots of different types of whole body vibration sources here.

83
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:17,010
So off road machineries that would include things like construction equipment and logging and agricultural equipment.

84
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:23,850
Lots of people exposed here, I should say.

85
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:29,579
I think these are exposure sources. Excuse me. So this is like a an inventory distribution.

86
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:39,330
So, you know, somewhere between, say, 100,000 and 150,000 mobile offroad machines in these countries and tractors here,

87
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:43,290
which again would be primarily agriculture, but can be used for other purposes here.

88
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:49,650
You know, we've got a pretty big gradient here where Finland has relatively few and Poland has,

89
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:54,180
you know, five times as many basically forklift truck trucks.

90
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:59,490
Again, if you think about forklifts being used in manufacturing and maybe in construction,

91
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:04,260
not so many in use in Finland, but a huge number in use in Poland.

92
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,759
And then we can think about trucks. So it's it's one thing to think about.

93
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:13,950
Well, that's a very specialized off road piece of equipment, you know, a giant tractor, a harvester or something.

94
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:19,170
You can imagine that's going to have a lot of vibration. But what about just regular old trucks for commercial transport?

95
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:28,049
You know, no estimates from Germany. Spain thinks, well, we've got over 4.4 million if we include vans in France.

96
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:32,400
Is that pushing 6 million when you count vans and articulated trucks?

97
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:39,150
So there's a huge inventory of vibration producing equipment, but that doesn't sort of cover the gamut.

98
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:49,140
We've still got things like paving machines and rollers that are used to smooth out asphalt once it's been poured trucks at airports.

99
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,400
We haven't talked about locomotives, but of course the is vibrate quite a bit too.

100
00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:00,690
You know, when we think about Finland, they've got fun sending things like snow scooters and things along those lines.

101
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:07,560
So my point again is. There is a lot of equipment out there that potentially produces whole body vibration.

102
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:11,010
So those are the sources that we need to be interested in.

103
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:17,190
Now, I said we don't have much in the way of data from the U.S. and that's true.

104
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:21,510
And really, the best estimates we have come from back in the late 1980s,

105
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:28,139
when Nash estimated that potentially up to 7 million workers or maybe 4 to 7% of

106
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:33,300
the whole U.S. workforce have the potential for exposure to whole body vibration.

107
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:37,290
And so I want to ask you all a question here.

108
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:40,500
But first, I'll tell you and I've mentioned this in class before,

109
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,390
when I was working at the University of Washington, I did a lot of work with the logging industry.

110
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:53,310
And so these folks are going out and they're clearing the trees out of the forest and dragging them into to sawmills, basically to be processed.

111
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,820
And this is a piece of equipment called a Skitter.

112
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:02,550
Basically, there's chains on the back and they connect those chains to logs and they skid them or drag them around.

113
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:09,780
And I can't tell you how many times I would watch these operators. I mean, these these pieces of equipment are ungodly powerful.

114
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:14,459
And the drivers get the sense that, like, nothing can stop me when I'm in this.

115
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:20,220
And so I would watch them just drive along and it's like, well, you could swerve around that giant boulder or you just drive right over it.

116
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:27,390
And you can imagine if you swerve around and stay on flat ground, your vibration exposure might not be as much as if you drive over this huge

117
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:32,250
boulder sticking out and then you bottom out your suspension on the other side.

118
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:38,940
So even within an industry, there can be different opportunities for exposure just based on how people drive.

119
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:43,020
So let me stop talking for a moment and just ask you, you know,

120
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:49,110
if we start to think about occupations where industries that are out there I've talked about a few already,

121
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:55,800
but what else comes to mind in terms of people, jobs, equipment that might have high levels of whole body vibration?

122
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:01,700
For the people cutting grass. You know they're on the ground.

123
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:07,130
Oh, absolutely. Yeah, those right on mowers. And who knows how long they spend on those per day.

124
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:11,180
You know, maybe in eight, ten, 12 hours. Yeah. Flight attendants are pilots.

125
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:11,900
Sure.

126
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:22,790
So anybody in commercial air traffic and they have you might imagine the grass mowers have a relatively constant exposure, whereas a flight attendant,

127
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:23,899
a pilot, you know,

128
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:30,050
things may be relatively smooth and then you hit turbulence and suddenly you you have shocks instead of sort of more gradual vibration.

129
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:34,580
It's a great example. Yeah, bus drivers.

130
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:41,090
Bus drivers. Absolutely, Christine. I was going to say the one more makes me think of industrial farming.

131
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:46,819
Sure. Yeah. So really any type of farming that involves powered equipment, you know,

132
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:52,190
you're typically out in nature, you're plowing, you're harvesting, you're going over uneven ground.

133
00:12:52,670 --> 00:13:00,650
You know, the equipment today is is pretty posh compared to older equipment where it's got suspension and that kind of thing.

134
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:04,610
Nevertheless, there can be huge exposures there. Absolutely.

135
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:12,620
Other ideas. You know, I'll tell you, one group I haven't talked about so far is the military.

136
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:19,420
And so a lot of the research that's been done that's sort of on the more consistent vibration,

137
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:22,240
like you make it up the lawnmower before that impact stuff.

138
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:27,970
So imagine, you know, you're driving along at 60 miles per hour in an armored personnel carrier and you hit a bomb.

139
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:31,990
Those things have a much different suspension than our passenger vehicles we're used to.

140
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:37,780
And then there's been a ton of reports of back injuries among the special forces, for instance.

141
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:41,889
So if you imagine like a SEAL team on an inflatable boat,

142
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:45,520
they get dropped off by a helicopter in the middle of the ocean and they're speeding to the beach.

143
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:49,470
And if you've ever been on a boat at high speed, you end up with the slapping against the waves.

144
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:55,180
So they've had lots and lots of injuries and lots of research as a result to figure out how to cut down on that exposure.

145
00:13:56,530 --> 00:14:03,190
So you're absolutely right. I mean, all the things you mentioned, you know, to pilots and flight attendants, we could add like helicopter pilots,

146
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:08,980
locomotive engineers, subway conductors, all these folks have pretty high potential.

147
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:13,209
Now, it's one thing for me to to talk to you about what whole body vibration might be.

148
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:18,910
But I'm going to show you this short video of a gentleman who's actually experiencing it in his mining equipment here.

149
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:54,519
So I mean, you might imagine someone in a truck or a bus having, again,

150
00:14:54,520 --> 00:15:00,280
that that relatively consistent vibration this person has that as the motors running.

151
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:05,800
But you can also see there's a bunch of shocks introduced there as he's driving over rough terrain, etc.

152
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,280
Let me just pause a moment to make sure I started the recording here.

153
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:18,400
Good. So. So that's what whole body vibration might look like for someone who's in a resource extraction industry like mining.

154
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:23,860
Now, when we go to actually assess or measure a whole body vibration,

155
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:30,280
a lot of the concepts here are very similar to noise, which is why I've kind of put this right after our noise segment.

156
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:36,470
So we're interested in a lot of the same things. One is the amplitude, sort of how intense is the vibration?

157
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:42,760
We can also think about the frequency and we can think about that both in terms of the spectrum.

158
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:50,229
So is this low frequency mid or high? But we can also think about it in terms of, well, how often does this exposure happen?

159
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:54,520
This every hour, every day, once a month, and then the duration.

160
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:58,840
How long is the exposure once you're actually in that situation?

161
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:03,700
So sort of how much, how often and how long?

162
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,649
These are our standard environmental health questions.

163
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:13,930
But the key difference here from noise is that vibration doesn't get measured just in sort of one axis.

164
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:20,770
So if we think about the body, traditionally we've thought about it vibrating in one of three different directions.

165
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:24,520
So we have a z-axis sort of a head to toe or top to bottom.

166
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:32,500
We have a y axis sort of left to right, and then we have an x axis before and after or sort of front to back.

167
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:39,610
And so to truly understand vibration, we need to understand what's happening in all three of those axes.

168
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:44,320
And if you're looking for a fun word to drop next time, you're looking to impress someone.

169
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:51,940
If you've got someone who is easily impressed, you could drop the word orthogonal, which basically means at 90 degrees to each other.

170
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:56,019
So here we've got three different axes to all at 90 degrees to the rest.

171
00:16:56,020 --> 00:17:02,709
Those are orthogonal axes that we're looking at. So we've spent a lot of time talking about noise.

172
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:13,000
We've talked about the idea of sound pressure. You know, we can quantify that as Pascals or we can convert that to decibels with vibration.

173
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,350
The underlying principle that we're interested in here is acceleration.

174
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:23,320
So that's the change in velocity of an object as a function of time.

175
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:30,100
So recall again that Pascals were the sound pressure measure that we used for noise.

176
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:33,999
In the case of vibration, we're using units of meters per second,

177
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,970
so there's our velocity and it's meters per second squared, which is a measure of acceleration.

178
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:46,030
And so, you know, if we imagine some kind of moving object on a spring, you know,

179
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:55,270
just like the particles in the air that are getting hit by acoustic energy and they're snapping back into place after they move a little bit,

180
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:58,270
we have the same concept with some vibrating object,

181
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:04,599
so it's moving back and forth and we can visualize that movement as a sine wave, just like we did with the noise.

182
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:14,530
So again, lots of similarities here. And I will say like the concept at least of noise in, in public and communities excuse me,

183
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:21,100
public in occupational settings, we're typically interested mostly in the average exposure over time.

184
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:26,050
Now I mentioned this kind of impact or shock exposures that the military has,

185
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:32,800
a ton of those are very important, but it's it's almost a totally different type of vibration.

186
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:39,580
So we're going to focus in this class more on the average. You know, in terms of frequency, we can also, as I said,

187
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:46,870
described vibration in terms of cycles per second or Hertz, just like sound and just like sound.

188
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:53,470
You know, we can have a single component that's moving in a very predictable way and we can say that's at a single frequency.

189
00:18:54,210 --> 00:19:01,420
And so if you take, you know, any one of these black or green or blue moving blocks here, we can plot them out as a sine wave.

190
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:05,260
If we imagine just one of those happening, that's our primary exposure.

191
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:12,010
That might be a single frequency. But for most things, imagine driving along in your car or in a bus on the road.

192
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,580
There's not just one thing vibrating you around the front of the bus,

193
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:19,330
maybe acting sort of independently from the back of the bus due to its suspension.

194
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:24,130
So more realistically, we have multiple frequency vibration going on.

195
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:31,330
Now, it turns out the human body is not equally sensitive to all frequencies of vibration.

196
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:36,730
Again, very similar to how the ear is not equally sensitive to all frequencies that we hear.

197
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:40,419
And so we've got this principle called resonance,

198
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:47,139
meaning that our body and all the segments that it's made of have some natural frequency that they want to vibrate at.

199
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:51,580
And if we put energy in at that frequency, they're going to respond in a very energetic fashion.

200
00:19:52,360 --> 00:20:01,750
And so just like with sound, we can measure a sort of broadband vibration across many frequencies, or we can break it down and make,

201
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:07,959
for instance, octave band or third octave band measurements to figure out what's happening in different ranges of frequencies.

202
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:15,090
And we do both of these depending on the application. So I mentioned this concept of resonance.

203
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:23,170
This is a super crusty old figure that I can't even find the original source from, but it's at least back into the 1960s, but still totally relevant.

204
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:28,840
And so what they've done here is essentially broken the body down into a series of springs

205
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:33,500
and tried to figure out what is the resonant frequency for any one of these components.

206
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,399
And so, you know, a couple of things to think of.

207
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:43,389
This is a little cut off on the screen, but it turns out the structures of your eye and the eyeball itself have a natural,

208
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:46,690
resonant frequency somewhere between 20 and 90 hertz,

209
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:55,569
meaning that if you are exposed to vibration of sufficient intensity in that frequency range, you're going to start to have trouble seeing.

210
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:59,400
Clearly, things are going to be vibrating too much and you literally can't track them visually.

211
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:09,610
So that's bad, right? Your abdominal mass and your chest wall are two sort of critical components of the body here.

212
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:14,110
And in fact, the abdominal mass is sort of where most of our body mass is located.

213
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:18,730
And the resonant frequency there is much lower at somewhere between four and eight hertz.

214
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:26,499
And so for the purposes of whole body vibration, where we're kind of interested in, well, what is that the majority of your body getting exposed to?

215
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,270
That's going to be your abdominal mass here.

216
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:34,630
And so that turns out to be the frequency of a sort of primary interest when we're thinking about full body vibration.

217
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:41,380
So when we're measuring whole body vibration across a bunch of different frequencies,

218
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:46,140
just like sound, we have this concept of a waiting network that we can put in.

219
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:53,440
So remember, we can convert VB Today when we apply a weighting, we can do the same thing with vibration.

220
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:58,749
And so we've got basically two weighting networks here and you know, don't shoot the messenger.

221
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:02,550
I'm not the one that picks these crazy nomenclature here.

222
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:08,170
So for the X and y axis here, we've got the D waiting network.

223
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:12,700
And so this is what the D waiting network looks like or W 70.

224
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:20,440
And it's basically saying we are counting the low frequencies and we're sort of tossing out a lot of the high frequencies,

225
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:28,330
kind of the opposite of maybe a four sound. And the x and y axis, remember, are four and a half, two and side to side.

226
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:34,330
And then we've got the K waiting for the Z axis, that's the top to bottom axis.

227
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:40,090
And that axis throws out some of the lower frequencies and really emphasizes some of the middle frequencies.

228
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:43,690
Again, pretty similar to the DTA waiting for noise.

229
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:51,790
And so if we take measurements across a bunch of different frequencies and then we run them through these weighting networks,

230
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:57,760
just like we do for sound, we're going to come up with a weighted average vibration exposure here.

231
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:05,230
Now, one of the things I'll mention is, you know, we talked about the concept of directivity for a noise source.

232
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:10,450
Does this source emanate more in one direction or is it relatively spherical?

233
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:16,030
You can think about the concept very similarly for vibration, but it turns out for vibration.

234
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:19,900
When you measure a speech or a tool or something along those lines,

235
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:24,820
there's almost always one of those axes that's going to be much, much greater than the others.

236
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:30,340
And so typically we've got one dominant axis and that's the one that we're most worried about.

237
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:37,930
So I brought a little bit of show and tell today just so you can get a sense of what this looks like.

238
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:44,370
So I'll just start start this at the front of the room and you guys can pass it around here.

239
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:50,380
Now, it's just shades of not being able to get that canister open last week at worst nightmare.

240
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:55,930
So so when it comes to measuring broadband vibration.

241
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:07,870
All right. Bear with me for a moment here. This is easily the worst part of graduate school instruction here, and I just ask you to pass that around.

242
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:16,180
So what I've handed out here is a small unit that's sort of the brains of the operation that actually measures the vibration.

243
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:23,170
And then the disk that you see that was holding, which is the same thing I've got up here, is what's called the accelerometer.

244
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:29,890
This device here is kind of cool as it's passed around, you'll see there's no display on the device.

245
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:37,239
This works only through a smartphone app, so the instrumentation and the circuitry is in the box here.

246
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:41,200
You can see that around on and then you access that through your smartphone.

247
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:48,250
And the reason they've done this is manufacturers have realized, gosh, if I can make a device that doesn't have a readout, I can make it much smaller.

248
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:53,500
And in the case of anything we might want to put on to work here, we want to make it as small as possible.

249
00:24:54,430 --> 00:25:00,040
So the idea here is you take that that accelerometer or disc accelerometers, it's called,

250
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:06,580
or once a worker sees it, they always have 100% of the time call it a whoopee cushion for obvious reasons.

251
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:10,540
And you put that essentially between their butt and the seat that they're.

252
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:19,840
Sitting on or if they're standing, you would put it underneath their feet and then essentially you keep it there for as long as they will tolerate it.

253
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:24,400
Now, we talked about noise dosimetry and you know, for a small dosimeter,

254
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:28,270
it's not such a big deal for a worker to wear that for eight for ten or 12 hours.

255
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:32,770
It's very small, it's lightweight. It's not typically in the way for something like this.

256
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:37,420
And I encourage you, you can pop it under your seat and sort of feel what it feels like.

257
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:41,770
This is not the kind of thing you want to sit on for 8 hours. It's not especially comfortable.

258
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:47,920
And so in this case, we're probably not going to do exactly we're not going to do an eight hour measurement.

259
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:50,380
We're going to do it for as long as the worker will tolerate it.

260
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:54,360
And then we're going to have to guess what the rest of the exposure was for the rest of the shift.

261
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:58,720
So some differences here between how we do this versus how we do sound.

262
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:05,860
And then as the worker sitting on this, the instrumentation is going to be measuring what are the vibration levels.

263
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:13,089
And I'll point out the accelerometers in this desk, they're actually three of them, and they're looking for the three different axes.

264
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:16,230
So there's an X axis, A Y and Z axis accelerometer.

265
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:23,110
These are the same kinds of accelerometers you have in your phone that let you, you know, shake your phone if you want to undo something you just did.

266
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:25,060
So it's all just measuring acceleration.

267
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:32,170
Once we have a worker sit on this for some period of time, we run it through the instrument, we apply our weighting curve.

268
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:36,610
And after the weighting, we can sort of figure out, well, where is the exposure occurring.

269
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:41,649
And so for the dark line here, this is the Z axis, the up and down axis, we would see, well,

270
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:46,870
this workers exposure looks like it's highest somewhere between, say, four and five hertz.

271
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:49,960
And again, that's right where the abdominal mass wants to vibrate.

272
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:57,880
So just like in noise control, we would take the spectrum and say, well, if I'm going to fix this problem, this is the frequency I need to change.

273
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:05,679
That's the point at which I want to intervene. You know, now we've got a little bit of math in this class, but not not so much.

274
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:12,040
Nothing like noise, I think. And so what we're really interested in at the end of the day is coming up with, well,

275
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:18,580
what is the worker's weighted acceleration in each of the axes that we're measuring?

276
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:28,940
So we're going to come up with a so that's the acceleration and it's going to be weighted for the X axis, the Y axis or the Z axis.

277
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:36,339
So we apply those weighting curves that I just talked about. And then we've got three hopefully fairly straightforward equations here.

278
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:42,159
So to compute the acceleration in the X axis, we're going to sum up a couple of things.

279
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:47,069
So we're going to take the product of the weighting at a particular frequency in the X axis.

280
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:55,720
So we're going to say here's the weighting at 250 hertz, 500 hertz, etc., we'll multiply that weighting by the actual acceleration at that frequency.

281
00:27:56,860 --> 00:28:02,349
Then we square that product, we sum all the frequencies that we measured and we take the square root.

282
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:06,940
So we are doing a root mean square operation here, just like we have to do for noise.

283
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:12,100
And that's going to give us are weighted acceleration in each of the three axes.

284
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:16,899
And as I said, typically one of these axes is going to be dominant.

285
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:21,340
It's going to be an order of magnitude or maybe several orders of magnitude higher than the others.

286
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:28,959
And it's sort of like noise. You know, we talked about if I introduce a source that's ten decibels below the existing sound level,

287
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,950
nope, that that source is not going to add anything. It's the same idea here.

288
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:37,690
If you have one axis that's completely dominant, the others really aren't adding anything to your risk.

289
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:46,770
So we had a chance last week to look at some of the the sort of output from some millimeters and dosimeters.

290
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:53,610
I just took a screengrab here of the smartphone display.

291
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:54,150
So again,

292
00:28:54,450 --> 00:29:01,190
the last day this meter that you guys are handing around interfaces with the smartphone and this is the kind of information you're going to get.

293
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:05,940
So there's a ton of information not uncommon for these real time sensors.

294
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:12,389
So the thing that's sort of highlighted here front and center in a circle is this is the acceleration,

295
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:20,880
the mass acceleration, and it's going to be the current acceleration you can see here.

296
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:26,070
This particular unit will give you well, here's what it was a second ago and here's what it is now.

297
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:34,110
So you can start to think, well, if it's sort of keeping track over time, I could do a time trace and see what is my vibration exposure look like?

298
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:39,120
Absolutely right. You know something we didn't really talk about last week?

299
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:44,670
There were some questions on this, a little meters about do I need to be in the high or the low range, if you remember those.

300
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:51,270
So remember, for most scientific instruments, there's going to be some limit to the range they can measure.

301
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:57,000
And if you are exposed to a level that's outside of that range, the instrument doesn't know what to do.

302
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:03,450
So if you've got your instruments set to measure 0 to 70 decibels and you expose it to 100 decibels,

303
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:07,050
it's going to say, I don't know how loud that is, but it's louder than 70.

304
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:13,889
That's all I can tell you. And so in that case, you'll get what's called an overload indicator, meaning in this case,

305
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:17,610
the vibration that was measured was greater than the instrument's range.

306
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:23,280
So you basically saturated the instrument. You you exceeded its ability to quantify the exposure.

307
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:27,360
And so if that comes on, you can say, well, I don't know what the highest exposure was,

308
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:31,110
but it was at least as high as the the highest limit on the instrument.

309
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:37,200
So that's a useful bit of information. You know, like most real time instruments, it's got a duration clock.

310
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:41,730
So how long has the worker been tolerating sitting on the the whoopee cushion here?

311
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,750
You know, battery status, that stuff's all relatively straightforward.

312
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:56,610
And then here you can see there's overall acceleration in the X and the Y in the Z axis, and it'll give us lots of different breakdowns.

313
00:30:56,610 --> 00:30:59,730
So here's the routine square average for each of the axes.

314
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:05,100
Here's the peak. So what was the very highest instantaneous acceleration that was reached?

315
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:11,130
And a few other values that we really don't even recognize in the United States, frankly.

316
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:22,020
And then I should mention what's being reported up here in the circle is the combination of the X in the Y and Z, the vector sum, as it's called.

317
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:29,129
And then we've got a few other sort of bits of information that are pretty useful.

318
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:33,810
So these are, again, kind of instantaneous values.

319
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:41,430
And then down here at the bottom of the screen are the the weighted accelerations kind of an average at for you too.

320
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:50,249
So I was curious, do rollercoaster manufacturers take into account trying to maximize the amount of directionality acceleration?

321
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:54,080
And has this plate ever been used on a roller coaster user?

322
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:55,919
Yeah, that's a great question.

323
00:31:55,920 --> 00:32:02,430
So, you know, roller coasters, amusement park rides, this is very much the kind of thing that the engineers are going to want to consider.

324
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:09,360
And it's a fine, fine balance there. So there's not a lot of places where we want to induce vibration and acceleration on people.

325
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:16,979
But a roller coaster is a great example. You know, maybe you're your Tesla on beast mode or whatever it is where it's like unlimited acceleration.

326
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:21,209
There's another one where we sort of throw the limits out the window. But in the case of a roller coaster,

327
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:26,580
it's going to be a balancing act between how much acceleration is fun and how much is going to cause people to pass out.

328
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:33,450
And so in that case, they're going to be very, very attuned to what's sort of the zone for fun where,

329
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:36,179
oh, my gosh, you know, my stomach has dropped out of my body.

330
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:40,620
It's, you know, I'm laughing versus I'm passed out because all the blood's pooled in my legs.

331
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:46,770
So, yeah, this is the kind of thing that isn't necessarily measured, although it could be I, you know,

332
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:52,020
the technology exists, but it's sort of conceptually put into the design of the ride, if that makes sense.

333
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:56,969
Yeah, great question. That's a very on the one hand, niche application, but it's also, again,

334
00:32:56,970 --> 00:33:02,250
one that we all seek out for fun rather than try to avoid like most occupational exposures.

335
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:03,630
Great point.

336
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:13,440
So when it comes to exposures and we've measured the exposures, the next question, of course, is, well, what am I going to compare this number to?

337
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:17,670
So the European Union has limits, as I've mentioned, and we'll get to those in a minute.

338
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:23,520
But HGH, as they often do, has a threshold limit value for whole body vibration.

339
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:29,760
Now, they put a limit on this. They say it's valid for a crest factor of less than nine.

340
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:36,060
So the crest factor is basically what is the ratio between the average exposure and the peak exposure.

341
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:40,799
And so if you have a crest factor of. One. That means you don't have any peaks.

342
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:46,830
It's just a continuous exposure. The bigger that crest factor gets, the more you're getting into that impulsive type of exposure.

343
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:53,520
And so HGH says if you're at a crest factor bigger than nine, and you're absolutely right,

344
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:58,790
that is a totally different damage mechanism for sort of continuous exposure.

345
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:06,480
We're interested in what is your chronic average exposure, and we'll get to the health effects in a minute for those snacks and impacts.

346
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:11,520
The impulses, the chronic is out the window. We're worried about like cracking a vertebrate right now.

347
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:18,540
So they basically put a little bit of a limit on there to say you can't use this to justify super high, very brief exposures.

348
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:28,560
And they also say very specifically, this is not designed to be used in ships or oil rigs or other offshore platforms because the conditions there,

349
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:32,730
again, it's all vibration, but the conditions are dissimilar, let's say.

350
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:39,420
So what HGH has said is, all right, here is something very similar to what we've looked at for noise.

351
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:49,770
So we've got an allowable duration, you know, going from 24 hours in a day to 8 to 4 down to about, let's say, 15 minutes a day.

352
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:54,870
And they've established a TRV and they've established an action level.

353
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:58,769
And the 12 is sort of you should never exceed these values.

354
00:34:58,770 --> 00:35:02,910
And the action level is you really want to keep people below these.

355
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:08,160
And if you're between these two areas, you need to be putting some kind of management plan into place.

356
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:13,800
So HGH here is identified that if you're exposed for an average of 8 hours per day,

357
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:22,950
then the allowable exposure limit is it'll be of 0.87 meters per second squared, and that's a vector sum.

358
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:28,260
So that's the average of the X and the Y and Z that we'll talk about in just a moment here.

359
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:35,850
So if you take that table and you plot it out to make it a little more user friendly, you get something that looks like this.

360
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:39,990
So we've got different exposure durations up to 24 hours in the day.

361
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:45,180
We've got different weighted accelerations from zero all the way up to six meters per second squared.

362
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:51,959
And then we've got the dark line is the TLT. And so everything that's above the dark line here is a no go.

363
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:57,150
We can't have people exposed to those levels. We've got the action limit or the action level.

364
00:35:57,150 --> 00:36:01,830
Here is the dashed line. If people are below that, we are not concerned about them at all.

365
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:09,450
And then the people who are exposed in this area between the TV and the action limit our folks need to keep an

366
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:15,540
eye on and we need to have surveillance to make sure they are protected and not suffering the health impacts.

367
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:24,990
So, you know, a reasonable question or an asked like, well, you know, what are exposure levels out there for a roller coaster?

368
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:31,170
Which is a great question. But as I've already said, there are a ton of different sources of whole body vibration out there.

369
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:40,170
And so I took this from a document that essentially synthesized some recommendations from the health and safety executive in the United Kingdom.

370
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:44,610
Again, Europe is just decades ahead of us with regards to vibration exposure,

371
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:49,680
and so you can't quite see it on the screen, but hopefully you can see it in your notes.

372
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:54,989
So just off the top of the screen here on the screen background is the acceleration

373
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:58,890
from zero meters per second squared all the way up to 20 meters per second squared.

374
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:03,059
Now, remember, 9.81 meters per second squared.

375
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:08,150
Anybody know what that number corresponds to? Exactly.

376
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:15,889
So. So that's 1g1 equivalent of gravity is 9.81 meters per second squared.

377
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:19,820
So almost exactly halfway down the middle of this graphic here.

378
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:29,330
And so you can see there is a ton of equipment that has exposures sort of of let's say ten meters per second squared or less.

379
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:34,970
And I'll say these are essentially little box plots here that we're looking at where we've got a minimum,

380
00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:40,210
a maximum, and then we've got the interquartile range. So there's lots of pieces of equipment.

381
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:49,820
For example, a wheeled excavator, other types of excavator, a forward are used in forestry that are sort of well below one g.

382
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:57,589
But there's also lots of pieces of equipment that are well above one G and certainly well above what the TLB would recommend for us.

383
00:37:57,590 --> 00:38:04,310
So you'll see, for instance, asphalt, pavers and what have we got here?

384
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:10,130
Scrapers like run along roadways and pick up excess debris.

385
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:15,260
These things can have some pretty darn high vibration levels for the human body.

386
00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:22,100
So I guess to take home messages here, there are some sources that have really high exposures, but there's just a lot of sources, period.

387
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:28,100
And so we need to understand, well, what are people exposed to so we can figure out how big might the problem be.

388
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:36,649
Now, there are a number of organizations around the world in the past, say ten years, that are starting to build up databases.

389
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:41,360
So I've already told you, we don't really deal with human migration in the United States.

390
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:45,469
We don't have an ocean regulation on this. So it's kind of like the Wild West here.

391
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:50,780
People don't, for the most part, have instruments or maybe even can't even get their hands on instruments.

392
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:54,680
But we still know if we're being good occupational environmental health folks.

393
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:59,240
We still want to know what you know as an approximation of people's exposures.

394
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:06,440
So, for instance, the Army Public Health Command has put together an online database where you can

395
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:10,489
pull up this website and you can actually search for different kinds of equipment.

396
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:15,830
And they're uploading the measurements that they've made and making it publicly available.

397
00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:23,480
So this is not quite as good as you going out to your facility or worksite and making a measurement yourself on your equipment.

398
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:31,160
But it's way better than nothing. At least we know it's made by environmental health professionals here, employed by the military.

399
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:37,340
So, you know, we can talk about sort of the instantaneous vibration, but as I said,

400
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:44,059
we're more interested in what's the weighted acceleration as an eight hour average at a time weighted average here.

401
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:51,410
And we've got a couple of different equations we can apply so we can figure out the eight hour average acceleration in the X axis,

402
00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:57,260
in the Y axis, and also in the Z axis, now the x axis in the y axis.

403
00:39:57,260 --> 00:40:05,270
So remember they were the UK weighting, they have the same weighting and they have the same equation here as a result.

404
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:11,870
So if I know, for instance, what my weighted acceleration is in the x axis,

405
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:18,979
I can multiply that by 1.4 and then I can also multiply that by the square root of the time.

406
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:24,290
A person is actually exposed divided by the time that they're allowed to be exposed.

407
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:33,559
And so using that equation, I can figure out the X in the Y axis acceleration and then the Z axis is almost an identical equation.

408
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:37,580
It just doesn't have that 1.4 multiplier, otherwise identical.

409
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:46,070
As I said, for most pieces of equipment, there's going to be a single dominant axis and it's often going to be Z, but it isn't always the case there.

410
00:40:46,850 --> 00:40:52,160
And so these graphs that are a little washed out on the screen here, but hopefully you can see them in your notes.

411
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:57,469
These are some Finnish data from three different types of equipment.

412
00:40:57,470 --> 00:41:02,210
So the dark bars are from a snow groomer like you would find at a ski resort.

413
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:10,640
The sort of hashed bars here are from a forwarder, which is a logging equipment that moves, logs back and forth.

414
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:15,080
And then the other bars, the white open bars, are from a snowmobile.

415
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:21,259
And so each of these traces is a spectrum that was measured on this particular piece of equipment.

416
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:27,080
So this is the spectrum in the x axis, in the dark lines for a snow groomer.

417
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:35,419
This is the spectrum in the open bars in the Y axis for a snowmobile, and then the hash bars.

418
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:39,350
Here are the Z axis measurements on a forwarder.

419
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:45,530
And so you'll see here these are three different kinds of off road equipment and they have three totally different spectra.

420
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:50,180
So for the snow groomer, you can see the Z axis.

421
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:55,430
So the dark bars here are much bigger in the Z axis than they are for X and Y.

422
00:41:55,760 --> 00:42:05,960
Hopefully everybody can see that. On the flip side, for the forwarder here, the hash lines, it's actually the y axis that has the biggest exposure.

423
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:11,410
Hash bars in the Z in the X axis are shorter. And then for the.

424
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:18,330
What have we got left here? The snowmobile, it's actually the x axis that people are getting the most exposure.

425
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:22,930
So you might not. Well, I would go so far as to say there's no way you could guess that.

426
00:42:23,350 --> 00:42:27,100
Just looking at the equipment, this is why it's so important for us to make measurements.

427
00:42:29,470 --> 00:42:39,340
The ultimate step we can take here again is figuring out, well, what is the eight hour average acceleration for a particular piece of equipment?

428
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:41,080
So just looking through an example here,

429
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:47,230
let's say I've got a driver and this driver spends six and a half hours a day on whatever piece of equipment they're driving.

430
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:55,579
Let's say we've taken our whole body vibration meter out and we measured 0.2 meters per second squared in the x axis,

431
00:42:55,580 --> 00:43:00,310
side to side point four meters per squared in the Y axis, four and a half,

432
00:43:00,730 --> 00:43:04,930
and then point to five meters per second squared in the Z axis, top to bottom.

433
00:43:05,530 --> 00:43:10,560
So what are the equivalent eight hour exposures? The person worked for six and a half hours.

434
00:43:10,570 --> 00:43:18,129
I want to estimate the eight hour exposure. And so for each of these, the reference time here is going to be 8 hours.

435
00:43:18,130 --> 00:43:23,320
So that's my nighty night. And the time of exposure is going to be six and a half hours.

436
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:34,479
So that's that's the same across all these equations in the x axis, I have 0.2 meters per second squared and y I have 0.4 and in the eight excuse me,

437
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:39,280
in the 0.25 meters per second squared, that's all straight out of the question.

438
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:45,100
Again, the X and the Y axis have this 1.4 multiplier that we put in.

439
00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:51,520
And if I run through this math and do my square roots and multiplication, I can figure out,

440
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:58,810
well, for the the x axis here, the average for the day is 0.25 meters per second squared.

441
00:43:59,410 --> 00:44:04,299
It's 0.5 for the Y axis and it's 0.23 for the Z axis here.

442
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:09,070
So this is a relatively rare case where all three axes are pretty similar.

443
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:15,310
Nevertheless, the Y axis is dominant. It's, you know, twice as much acceleration as the next frequency.

444
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:19,750
So that's going to be the axis that we're most interested in control in this case.

445
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:22,150
That's going to be the four and after axis.

446
00:44:24,690 --> 00:44:32,370
So I'll be the first to admit that when you're out making vibration measurements, which frankly probably none of you will ever do in your career,

447
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:35,760
just because just getting your hands on the instruments is challenging,

448
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:42,240
but having to keep track of the X and Y and Z axis, we absolutely have to measure them all.

449
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:46,600
But at the end of the day, if it's typically one axis that's dominant, you know,

450
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:53,909
let's just either report the dominant axis or if there really isn't one axis that is dominating all the rest,

451
00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:57,810
we can take the vector sound, the average of all of them.

452
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:03,389
And so this is sort of the next step to come up with an overall weighted acceleration.

453
00:45:03,390 --> 00:45:10,049
We would take our our X axis acceleration, the Y axis in the Z axis square.

454
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:16,710
Each of those put in our 1.4 factors here for the X and Y axis, and then take the square root of all of that.

455
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:24,540
And that's going to give us a single number where we can describe this entire vibration exposure as the total weighted exposure.

456
00:45:25,410 --> 00:45:29,520
So just to look at an example of what that would be like, let's say I've got a different driver.

457
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:32,670
This person's behind the wheel for 8 hours a day.

458
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:42,600
They've got 0.3 meters per second squared in the x axis, 0.3 in the Y axis, and slightly higher 0.35 in the Z axis.

459
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:45,720
What's their total weighted exposure?

460
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:56,010
So the same equation that I just showed you, I'm going to point in my plug in my point three in the x axis, 2.3 in the Y and .35 in the Z Square.

461
00:45:56,010 --> 00:46:02,730
All those terms multiplied by my fixed factor for the X in the Y axis.

462
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:10,770
Do some plug and chug and I get to figure out the overall weighted acceleration here is just under 4.7 meters per second squared.

463
00:46:11,430 --> 00:46:18,480
So, you know, we are interested in each axis, but at the end of the day, having one number and that three is is kind of handy.

464
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:24,900
Now, I mentioned that HGH has a threshold limit value for whole body vibration exposure.

465
00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:32,400
The European Union also has standards that actually pre-date the HGH standard slide.

466
00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:36,690
And so in the European Union, they said two things.

467
00:46:36,690 --> 00:46:40,979
They have an exposure limit value and an exposure action value.

468
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:44,850
So that's sort of like the TLG and the actual limit or the actual level.

469
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:48,540
And so in the EU, if you're on a piece of equipment,

470
00:46:48,690 --> 00:46:57,419
you are allowed to have a weighted acceleration of 1.15 meters per second squared for eight straight hours.

471
00:46:57,420 --> 00:47:04,829
You can't exceed that. And the standard is written such that if you've got folks or anywhere close to that,

472
00:47:04,830 --> 00:47:08,549
you have to put in, you know, essentially the equivalent of a hearing conservation program.

473
00:47:08,550 --> 00:47:18,959
You put in a vibration control program to bring those workers down as far as possible, ideally at least to the action value here.

474
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:24,510
So you're allowed 1.15. We'd really like you to be at point five or less.

475
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:32,160
And this difference area. So again, the sort of zone between the action value and the limit value is where we have

476
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:36,480
to put into place some control measures to try to reduce worker's exposures.

477
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:44,560
And we'll talk about what those are in just a moment. So the graph I showed you earlier that had all the different types of construction,

478
00:47:44,610 --> 00:47:50,040
agricultural equipment in the max and min and inter quartile ranges.

479
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:56,610
Those were more sort of instantaneous measurements. If you just went out and took a random minute of measurement as the values you might get.

480
00:47:57,420 --> 00:48:01,020
What we're looking at here, these are daily exposure averages.

481
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:06,690
So recognizing that for different types of equipment, you might not actually run it for eight straight hours.

482
00:48:07,170 --> 00:48:11,100
So, you know, if you're on a farm tractor, maybe you do drive for eight straight hours.

483
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:15,660
But if you're on a piece of construction equipment, you might only be driving it for 4 hours a day.

484
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:21,479
So that duration of exposure, we have to factor into account, and that's been done in this graph here.

485
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:24,540
So now we're looking at different types of equipment.

486
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:32,670
We've got the EU value here of 1.15 as their exposure limit value and here's their exposure action value.

487
00:48:33,150 --> 00:48:37,740
And you can see virtually all of these pieces of equipment when we consider a typical

488
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:44,340
operator's day are in that zone between the action value and the exposure limit value,

489
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:52,170
meaning that for all of these types of equipment, we really should be putting into place some kinds of controls to reduce the worker's exposure.

490
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:59,110
So before we talk about the controls, I'll just make a few comments.

491
00:48:59,110 --> 00:49:02,290
You know, why are we even worried about whole body vibration in the first place?

492
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:08,979
Usually there's got to be some kind of health outcome to motivate this, and there are a variety of them for whole body vibration.

493
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:15,910
So any of you who have ever been on a boat and been feeling seasick, that is a form of whole body vibration exposure.

494
00:49:16,510 --> 00:49:22,660
And it turns out motion sickness is brought on very selectively by frequencies that are less than one hertz.

495
00:49:23,110 --> 00:49:32,620
So if you imagine sort of that vibration exposure that has a 100 or a 200 hertz or 200 vibrations per second, that's not going to cause seasickness.

496
00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:38,949
But if it's less than one second, like the waves on the ocean tend to be, that's what really drives motion sickness.

497
00:49:38,950 --> 00:49:45,909
And so all the whole body vibration limits out there specifically exclude things less than one hertz,

498
00:49:45,910 --> 00:49:48,400
because it's like if you if you want to avoid seasickness,

499
00:49:49,030 --> 00:49:54,820
that's a different question than if you want to avoid back injuries or something from higher frequencies of vibration.

500
00:49:55,510 --> 00:50:00,760
And so speaking of back to back is definitely a prime target for whole body vibration,

501
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:05,350
particularly for people who are sitting and getting that vibration exposure.

502
00:50:05,350 --> 00:50:10,629
So we talked about the abdomen having a 4 to 8 hertz resonance frequency.

503
00:50:10,630 --> 00:50:14,230
The spine is typically a 10 to 12 hertz resonance.

504
00:50:14,710 --> 00:50:21,520
So if you're getting sort of ten vibrations per second, that's going to hit your spine hardest.

505
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:28,270
And there are lots and lots of studies out there very strongly linking whole body vibration to lower back pain.

506
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:36,250
So, you know, Velma, you mentioned bus drivers. I worked with a population of bus drivers in King County where the University of Washington is.

507
00:50:36,610 --> 00:50:45,430
And it was like 98% prevalence of low back pain among these workers, maybe not all attributable to vibration, but certainly a chunk of it was.

508
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:53,470
And so, for instance, taxi drivers, bus drivers, other drivers who spend more than 50% of their work time driving.

509
00:50:53,470 --> 00:51:02,170
There's a number of studies that have showed there about three times as likely to experience lower back pain as people in different non exposed jobs.

510
00:51:02,890 --> 00:51:11,230
So the back and the spine are big targets here, but the skeletal system broadly is also a target for whole body vibration.

511
00:51:11,230 --> 00:51:16,570
So as you might imagine, if your skeleton is constantly getting pounded with vibrations,

512
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:24,910
you start to introduce the possibility of maybe cartilage degeneration or spinal disc degeneration, maybe even fractures.

513
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:30,700
And this military folks that I was talking about with the impact exposure, it's it's fractures that they're worried about.

514
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:37,180
It also turns out there's been studies looking at people both standing and seated exposures,

515
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:41,830
showing them to actually lose a bit of height as they're vibrating.

516
00:51:41,830 --> 00:51:47,500
So, you know, your discs are essentially getting compressed in your spine, taking away from your height.

517
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:52,750
This turns out to be reversible. So as you get out of the exposure situation, you will return to your natural height.

518
00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:57,340
But that's just kind of bizarre in terms of sensory.

519
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:02,950
So I mentioned that if your body is bouncing between 20 and 90 times per second,

520
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:06,189
you're going to start to get some visual impairment you won't be able to see.

521
00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:11,799
Clearly that turns out to be a dominant vibration frequency range for helicopters.

522
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:15,790
And you imagine a group of people who really need to see clearly it's helicopter pilots.

523
00:52:16,180 --> 00:52:17,260
So that's problematic.

524
00:52:18,070 --> 00:52:24,700
And if any of you have ever been in a conversation in a car and you've got to over sort of a bumpy road and had trouble talking,

525
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:31,419
it turns out five hertz tends to compress your lungs and it can make it difficult to talk at that particular frequency.

526
00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:36,790
So, again, some unexpected effects here, cardiovascular effects.

527
00:52:36,790 --> 00:52:42,729
So it turns out that being vibrated somewhere between two and 20 times per second or two and 20

528
00:52:42,730 --> 00:52:48,760
hertz actually generates a cardiovascular response that's kind of similar to moderate exercise.

529
00:52:49,210 --> 00:52:57,880
So it kind of tweaks your system into behaving as though you were exercising and, you know, sort of understanding that cardiovascular linkage.

530
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:06,310
There are studies that have linked whole body vibration to things like hypertension, cardiovascular disease, varicose veins, all all bad things.

531
00:53:06,910 --> 00:53:11,410
And there is actually quite large body of literature on whole body vibration.

532
00:53:11,410 --> 00:53:15,520
And there's some other systems that maybe a handful of studies have identified,

533
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:23,049
like maybe whole body vibration can disrupt your endocrine system or your central nervous system or even your reproductive system.

534
00:53:23,050 --> 00:53:26,770
Those things are much less certain, I would say, but they've been sort of suggested.

535
00:53:27,550 --> 00:53:33,760
So I think it kind of makes sense. Your whole body is vibrating and lots of systems throughout your body may potentially be impacted,

536
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:38,650
but the ones that we are typically most concerned about are back injuries and low back pain.

537
00:53:41,030 --> 00:53:45,680
So I'll wrap up whole body vibration here and then we can take our hour break.

538
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:48,470
So when it comes to controlling vibration,

539
00:53:48,470 --> 00:53:55,840
we've got the same suite of options and hierarchy of controls that we do for any other occupational environmental hazards.

540
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:59,600
So we can think about controlling the source in some fashion.

541
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:05,630
We can think about controlling the path that the vibration travels to between the source and the worker or the person.

542
00:54:06,140 --> 00:54:09,140
And we can think about maybe controlling the person in some fashion.

543
00:54:09,140 --> 00:54:14,600
So let's kind of unpack this a little bit and see what what our actual options are here.

544
00:54:15,470 --> 00:54:18,020
So I included this figure because it's kind of an interesting flowchart.

545
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:25,820
It's basically the hierarchy of controls, but displayed in a way that is more friendly to the European crowd, apparently.

546
00:54:26,270 --> 00:54:34,219
And so we can talk about elimination and substitution like we do here in the U.S. They talk about it as avoidance here.

547
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:40,330
So, you know, how do we eliminate vibration from a process, an industrial process?

548
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:47,000
Well, you know, how do we design that process? We need to consider the function, the methods, what the process looks like.

549
00:54:47,270 --> 00:54:50,360
And we can tweak those to try to reduce the vibration. That's great.

550
00:54:51,530 --> 00:54:57,229
We could also think about more engineering controls. So trying to isolate that person from the vibration.

551
00:54:57,230 --> 00:55:06,890
So maybe we put in some sort of isolation between the process as well, let's say put it in at the level of the source essentially,

552
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:12,479
or we can put in a control between the source and the person who might be exposed.

553
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:17,000
So both of those would be isolation. We can think about modifying the working method.

554
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:22,220
So maybe we say, Hey, this vibration is really intense. You can only do this job for an hour a day and then you're done.

555
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:28,640
We'd call that an administrative control. They sort of label that as working methods or work organization.

556
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:31,130
We can also think about, Gosh,

557
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:39,499
what can I do to the source of the vibration that might influence exposure while maybe just maintaining the equipment in?

558
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:47,870
If any of you have ever owned a really old, not very well kept car as I did for most of my adult life, you know,

559
00:55:47,870 --> 00:55:53,899
the suspension, the springs, all that stuff shot in the car rides a lot rougher than a car, maybe of the same age.

560
00:55:53,900 --> 00:56:00,830
That's just been better taken care of. We can also think about, well, if the vibration actually gets to the person,

561
00:56:00,830 --> 00:56:06,320
what can I do to make sure that it's not getting into the systems that are most at risk, like the spine?

562
00:56:06,770 --> 00:56:12,440
You know, maybe I can sort of tweak the posture of the worker to minimize exposure that way.

563
00:56:13,070 --> 00:56:19,490
Maybe I could think about the physical condition of the worker. Maybe not all workers are fit to work in this high vibration environment.

564
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,780
Maybe I could train them, give instructions or other administrative controls.

565
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:29,989
You know, again, I can always limit exposure time and maybe I want to have a health surveillance program

566
00:56:29,990 --> 00:56:35,600
to to try to pick up if people seem like they're developing a low back pain issue,

567
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:43,240
for instance. So kind of zooming through these levels with some more specific examples and, you know,

568
00:56:43,250 --> 00:56:47,780
thinking about eliminating or substituting or otherwise reducing the source of the vibration.

569
00:56:48,230 --> 00:56:54,740
Well, there's a bunch of things we can do here. As you might imagine, for many types of equipment and forklifts are a great example.

570
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:58,730
There's different kinds of forklifts. Some of them are designed to be driven off road.

571
00:56:59,180 --> 00:57:03,920
Some of them really expect you to be on a nice, flat, smooth warehouse floor.

572
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:07,940
So if you're taking that warehouse forklift and you're driving it off road,

573
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:14,850
that's going to be horrible because that forklift doesn't have the kind of suspension and it's not designed for off road use.

574
00:57:14,850 --> 00:57:20,810
So we always want to use the right vehicle, you know, the right machine and make sure it has the right tires and suspension on it.

575
00:57:21,950 --> 00:57:28,010
I have worked with many employers who will have a big yard just for storing and sorting equipment,

576
00:57:28,370 --> 00:57:34,609
and that yard invariably is just filled with potholes and people have to swerve around piles of junk and stuff.

577
00:57:34,610 --> 00:57:43,999
And so having surfaces that have potholes built in like the entire Michigan road system is sort of guaranteeing that you're going to have high levels,

578
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:50,240
maybe even of that impulse type exposure. So we want to repair our travel surfaces whenever we can.

579
00:57:50,660 --> 00:57:54,470
Again, preventative maintenance can be huge in terms of reducing vibration.

580
00:57:55,130 --> 00:58:01,400
You know, if any of you have ever driven in a car that had a wheel that hadn't been properly balanced, you know,

581
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:07,070
they attach these little lead weights to the wheel to make sure that the wheel is is able to rotate in a balanced manner.

582
00:58:07,070 --> 00:58:13,280
If it doesn't, you're basically, you know, introducing a lot of vibration that you just don't need.

583
00:58:14,270 --> 00:58:18,169
You know, if we think about vibrating machinery, we talked about that in the noise control example.

584
00:58:18,170 --> 00:58:22,459
If I've got a machine that's vibrating, it's going to cause the floor below it to vibrate too.

585
00:58:22,460 --> 00:58:25,670
How about if I isolate the machine from the floor now?

586
00:58:25,670 --> 00:58:31,340
The machine's still vibrating, but the floor is not. And that means the person that standing next to the machine isn't vibrating either.

587
00:58:31,370 --> 00:58:37,550
That's all good. And I get into places where, you know, the whole establishment was vibrating.

588
00:58:37,820 --> 00:58:41,520
There was literally no stable surface. Of the workers to work on.

589
00:58:41,910 --> 00:58:48,780
And so in those cases, the employer had suspended catwalks from the ceiling and basically hung them on spring.

590
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:54,240
So the catwalks were isolated from the vibration of the building so the workers could stand and not be exposed.

591
00:58:55,290 --> 00:58:56,880
So those are all great solutions.

592
00:58:58,290 --> 00:59:04,560
We can also think about, again, altering the path of the route that the vibration takes between the source and the person.

593
00:59:05,130 --> 00:59:08,910
And there's almost always things we can do with vehicle suspension systems.

594
00:59:09,390 --> 00:59:12,840
So if you imagine kind of a generic Off-Road vehicle,

595
00:59:13,590 --> 00:59:20,250
the tires are designed in a way that they should absorb a fair amount of the vibration of the vehicle moving.

596
00:59:20,610 --> 00:59:24,450
There's going to be some sort of suspension connecting the tires and the wheels to the body.

597
00:59:24,450 --> 00:59:30,839
That's a further degree of vibration reduction in a really high vibration environment.

598
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:37,260
You might also want to have the cab that the worker sits in, isolated from the body of the rest of the equipment.

599
00:59:37,620 --> 00:59:41,490
So now we've got sort of three degrees of separation between the vibration and the human.

600
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:48,209
And then a fourth degree we can introduce would be to have a suspended seat or an anti vibration seat.

601
00:59:48,210 --> 00:59:50,400
And we'll look at an example of one of those at the moment.

602
00:59:51,210 --> 00:59:59,130
So lots of different ways we can interrupt that direct path of vibration from sort of tires to to driver.

603
01:00:00,450 --> 01:00:06,269
And then, of course, we can think about, well, what could I do on the driver's side to reduce exposure so I could limit exposure time?

604
01:00:06,270 --> 01:00:10,679
Again, I could say this is a really nasty task. You can only do this 2 hours a day.

605
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:14,580
And then you had to be in the office, you know, not vibrating for the rest of the day.

606
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:24,240
One key thing about the spine, so after your spine has been compressed and vibrated for eight straight hours,

607
01:00:25,260 --> 01:00:28,020
you know, the best possible circumstance there is,

608
01:00:28,020 --> 01:00:36,390
you're sitting, you know, upright, erect, perfectly vertical so that the load is being transmitted all the way through your spine in an equal fashion.

609
01:00:36,990 --> 01:00:44,399
Well, we don't want to have is people sort of slouching off to the side or guys who have, you know, a giant man satchel in their their back pocket.

610
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:47,460
So they're sitting in one leg is like six inches higher than the other.

611
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:54,180
That's making an uneven load on your spine that's going to result in an injury or as I have often seen.

612
01:00:54,180 --> 01:00:59,910
So a lot of the off road equipment tends to sit pretty high off the ground because it's designed for going after boulders and stuff.

613
01:01:00,450 --> 01:01:05,339
And so you'll see an operator at the end of the day jump out of the cab and it smash onto the ground.

614
01:01:05,340 --> 01:01:09,660
And now they're putting that huge load on their spine and already vulnerable to their exposure.

615
01:01:10,170 --> 01:01:15,840
So avoiding lots of bending and twisting right after the exposure, again, not sitting in your wallet, basically.

616
01:01:16,620 --> 01:01:26,069
I've seen employers who've said, you know, we've we've had a person at this workstation forever and they're always complaining of back pain.

617
01:01:26,070 --> 01:01:31,139
And it occurred to us we don't even need a person in there. So we we installed like a remote operating system.

618
01:01:31,140 --> 01:01:39,180
So the operator is no longer in that environment. They're, you know, using a closed circuit television and operating the machinery with zero exposure.

619
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:48,090
So that's a great fix. And then we can train workers sort of, you know, how do you need to behave with the equipment around you?

620
01:01:48,810 --> 01:01:57,600
And so I'll give you an example. Again, I worked with the bus drivers in King County, and the county at the time had invested over $1,000,000,

621
01:01:57,600 --> 01:02:02,280
putting in so-called anti-abortion seats in their busses for the drivers.

622
01:02:02,730 --> 01:02:05,130
So the drivers had had a ton of complains of back pain.

623
01:02:05,340 --> 01:02:13,319
You know, to the county's credit, they said we're going to invest in money and put in seats that instead of bouncing up and down with the bus,

624
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:16,620
will sort of start to slow down the vibration and dampen it.

625
01:02:17,310 --> 01:02:20,340
Great idea. What they didn't do is train the operators.

626
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:24,180
They just swapped out the new seats and the operators were like, This seat feels weird,

627
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:29,310
and all of these seats had an option to basically lock it in place and make it a fixed seat.

628
01:02:29,310 --> 01:02:34,560
So they were all doing that and basically totally bypassing this million dollar

629
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:39,210
investment and configuring the seat just like the seat that they were trying to replace.

630
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:47,309
Another example of a terrible training program. And so they actually saw that injuries went seemingly up a little bit after the investment

631
01:02:47,310 --> 01:02:52,710
because the older seats they'd replaced had at least a little bit of anti vibration capability.

632
01:02:53,220 --> 01:03:00,120
And when you lock out basically the nice seats that they bought, you're making it even worse than the seat to replace just a terrible idea.

633
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:06,570
So again, just to sort of codify what we don't want workers to do, we go back to our gentleman.

634
01:03:08,850 --> 01:03:16,310
And he's spending he's got to look over his shoulder. I didn't even load on the spine at all.

635
01:03:17,630 --> 01:03:25,460
So, you know, he needs to see behind him and we need to design this cab in a way that he can do that without having to twist around.

636
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:31,400
So this is the kind of thing where maybe a backup camera would help.

637
01:03:31,580 --> 01:03:36,470
Maybe he has a chair that swivels around so he can actually face backward when he needs to.

638
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:41,420
Lots of heavy equipment has that. But what we really want to avoid is what this guy is doing right here is he's got

639
01:03:41,420 --> 01:03:46,160
this really uneven load on his spine while he's going over these shocks and bumps.

640
01:03:48,270 --> 01:03:51,990
And then, of course, there's the technological fix. So this is super cool, I think.

641
01:03:52,770 --> 01:04:00,180
So I'll just play this video here. This is an active vibration control seat, just like the active noise control that we talked about.

642
01:04:07,010 --> 01:04:14,780
So you can see we've got our test dummy all rigged up here on the seats and the seats sitting on a platform that can vibrate.

643
01:04:20,310 --> 01:04:25,710
And so when the vibration is occurring and the active vibration control is turned off on the seat, it's vibrating.

644
01:04:25,830 --> 01:04:33,630
They turn the control on. You can see it just. Stabilized it and then they turn it back on off to get through some shocks.

645
01:04:34,710 --> 01:04:41,070
So, you know, it's not a perfect fix, but it can cut down the exposure pretty dramatically.

646
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:49,410
This is actually relatively older technology than the stuff that's off the shelf now is sort of two generations past this.

647
01:04:49,890 --> 01:04:55,650
The only reason you don't see this in lots of cars and trucks now is it costs about $60,000 to get one of these seats installed.

648
01:04:55,650 --> 01:05:02,150
So, you know, if you're a long haul truck driver with huge exposures, but not a huge amount of money,

649
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:06,880
and maybe a company that doesn't want to invest, that this technology isn't quite within reach now.

650
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:12,120
But I will say, you know, active noise control is also incredibly expensive when it was first introduced.

651
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:19,710
And then as more people started adopting it, the prices came down. So I think this has a a real potential here, but we're not quite there yet.

652
01:05:20,580 --> 01:05:23,610
All right. So we've come to to break time and a little bit path.

653
01:05:23,610 --> 01:05:30,420
So let's let's take 5 minutes here, come back at 12 after and we'll wrap up our our session on hand on vibration.

654
01:05:34,878 --> 01:05:44,208
All right, everybody, we'll jump back into this here. So we talked now about whole body vibration.

655
01:05:45,528 --> 01:05:49,847
And the corollary here is segmented their hand arm vibration, as I mentioned before.

656
01:05:49,848 --> 01:05:56,568
And so just like I said, you know, as opposed to energy that's being transmitted into our whole body here,

657
01:05:56,568 --> 01:06:03,768
it's basically energy that's only being transmitted into and maybe through one or two segments of our body.

658
01:06:05,988 --> 01:06:10,427
I didn't sort of present this information for whole body vibration because I couldn't find it.

659
01:06:10,428 --> 01:06:15,108
But for hand arm, I wanted to just recognize this is not a new phenomenon.

660
01:06:16,008 --> 01:06:23,778
You know, whole body vibration, I think, really didn't start to get looked into with any seriousness until maybe the 1960s and seventies.

661
01:06:24,408 --> 01:06:32,087
And our vibration, on the other hand, was recognized even way back in the early 20th century as a real problem for the workforce.

662
01:06:32,088 --> 01:06:37,128
And so Alice Hamilton, who some of you may know is the mother of industrial hygiene,

663
01:06:37,878 --> 01:06:43,878
did some of the first studies looking at the impact on workers from using pneumatic lee powered gardening tools.

664
01:06:44,298 --> 01:06:50,598
So, you know, tools that might be used for stone cutting or making gravestones, all sorts of things like that.

665
01:06:51,738 --> 01:06:58,338
About 20 years later, they started to realize that grinding tools were also associated with handling vibration.

666
01:06:58,908 --> 01:07:07,068
And then in World War Two, as we know, you know, Rosie the Riveter flew into our factories and she was producing tremendous amounts of raw material.

667
01:07:07,458 --> 01:07:15,888
We started to realize that there's lots of other pneumatic tools like riveters and drills that were also causing high levels of exposure.

668
01:07:16,608 --> 01:07:26,448
And, you know, the transition away from ax cutting of timber to chainsaw cutting happened in the late 1950s, early 1960s.

669
01:07:27,318 --> 01:07:33,498
And I would say this exposure of all the ones on the list here was like the biggest leap in risk.

670
01:07:34,518 --> 01:07:41,508
So old school chain saws were like totally uncontrolled vibration sources, also incredibly dangerous for other reasons.

671
01:07:42,018 --> 01:07:48,318
And so there was this massive uptick in health impacts from vibration in the sixties, from chainsaws.

672
01:07:49,488 --> 01:07:53,238
But even as late as the nineties, we're still discovering, you know, dental equipment.

673
01:07:53,238 --> 01:07:58,998
That ultrasonic scaler that your hygienist is holding in your mouth is associated with hand, arm,

674
01:07:58,998 --> 01:08:06,978
vibration and things like pneumatic knives that are used in meat cutting operations are are also sort of more recently recognized.

675
01:08:07,578 --> 01:08:12,437
So we talked about maybe 7 million people exposed to whole body vibration, Naish estimates.

676
01:08:12,438 --> 01:08:15,618
And again, these numbers are now almost 30 years out of date,

677
01:08:16,638 --> 01:08:21,468
but maybe a million and a half workers with potentially high levels of hand arm vibration.

678
01:08:22,998 --> 01:08:29,387
So a lot of what I'm going to cover here is, you know, identical basically to what we talked about for whole body vibration.

679
01:08:29,388 --> 01:08:36,138
So, you know, any time we've got a worker who's holding a tool that is operated based on impact,

680
01:08:36,148 --> 01:08:43,188
so even something as simple as a hammer or has some kind of rotary mechanism like a grinder or a chainsaw,

681
01:08:43,698 --> 01:08:49,757
things that are gas powered and have a motor built in or as I said, you know, pneumatic tools,

682
01:08:49,758 --> 01:08:54,468
other types of electric tools, all of those give us some potential for exposure.

683
01:08:54,508 --> 01:08:59,958
Now, it turns out frequency is a huge issue with hand arm vibration, just like it was for a whole body.

684
01:09:00,648 --> 01:09:08,268
So if we've got frequencies that are coming into our hand that are higher than 100 hertz, typically those don't make it past our hand.

685
01:09:08,688 --> 01:09:11,898
So the hand's going to absorb a lot of that high frequency energy.

686
01:09:12,138 --> 01:09:16,458
Just like with noise we talked about, high frequencies are relatively easy to stop,

687
01:09:16,938 --> 01:09:19,968
so they're really not going to make it past that first segment that they encounter.

688
01:09:20,418 --> 01:09:28,008
But lower frequency energy will travel through the hand, up into the forearm, maybe even reaching all the way up to the elbow in the shoulders.

689
01:09:28,548 --> 01:09:33,408
So for this reason, we've got a very similar waiting curve here.

690
01:09:33,408 --> 01:09:35,628
And you can see for hand arm vibration.

691
01:09:36,558 --> 01:09:46,398
The waiting curve sort of has its highest point here in the 12 to 16 Hertz region, and then it drops off quite precipitously up to a thousand hertz.

692
01:09:46,428 --> 01:09:50,538
The idea being that these really high frequencies aren't even making it much past your fingertips,

693
01:09:50,868 --> 01:09:53,928
but the lower frequencies could impact potentially your whole arm.

694
01:09:54,738 --> 01:10:01,007
And we've got the same type of three axis, three orthogonal axis measurement system.

695
01:10:01,008 --> 01:10:06,258
So here we've got the Z axis is kind of fore and aft through your arm,

696
01:10:06,558 --> 01:10:12,828
X is up and down in this case, which is a little counterintuitive, and Y is side to side.

697
01:10:12,828 --> 01:10:17,057
So it's not the same axis definition as it is for a whole body.

698
01:10:17,058 --> 01:10:21,168
That is, I would say, an oversight, but something we're still shackled with.

699
01:10:22,998 --> 01:10:29,118
So in terms of measurement here, I've got a couple more instruments that I will hand around to you.

700
01:10:29,928 --> 01:10:38,388
So the two instruments I've got here, one of them this is that same Larsen, David's unit that you guys were able to handle with the whoopee cushion.

701
01:10:38,868 --> 01:10:45,437
Now it's been inserted into a little, you know, armband or wristband so the unit can be mounted on you.

702
01:10:45,438 --> 01:10:51,708
You don't want to work or having to hold this. And then there's a fixture here that has an accelerometer on it and a little handle.

703
01:10:51,708 --> 01:10:55,518
And you would basically hold the accelerometer against the tool handle.

704
01:10:55,938 --> 01:11:03,738
And now we're measuring, you know, a close pass, a close representation, let's say, of the vibration getting into your hand.

705
01:11:04,848 --> 01:11:11,417
And then this other unit, just a different manufacturer, a different type of unit, has a much larger accelerometer.

706
01:11:11,418 --> 01:11:15,018
So this clunky little unit here is the accelerometer.

707
01:11:15,408 --> 01:11:16,757
It screws into this handle.

708
01:11:16,758 --> 01:11:22,908
And this one's designed not to be pressed against your palm, but actually to be held between two fingers against the tool here.

709
01:11:23,658 --> 01:11:29,448
So again, pass these around. You can imagine how long you'd be comfortable sort of operating this thing.

710
01:11:29,478 --> 01:11:38,507
I'll also say, you know, if you're operating a chainsaw and you've got some clunky bar between your handle in your hand,

711
01:11:38,508 --> 01:11:43,428
you know, that might be a safety hazard all by itself. Maybe you can't grip your tools as well.

712
01:11:44,598 --> 01:11:49,728
So these are imperfect. Again, this is not something we're going to make an eight hour measurement on for something like this.

713
01:11:49,728 --> 01:11:54,708
We might take a 32nd measurement and say, okay, we're good, let's let's get that off your your tool.

714
01:11:55,698 --> 01:12:04,008
There's other options, too. So one thing we could do is, instead of fixing this between the worker's hand and the handle of the tool,

715
01:12:04,398 --> 01:12:09,318
we could actually strap it on directly to the tool itself. So now the worker's not holding anything.

716
01:12:09,828 --> 01:12:15,888
That is, on the one hand, less of a safety hazard because we're not interfering with the worker's grip.

717
01:12:16,368 --> 01:12:22,248
But it's also maybe not as realistic as when we're measuring at the hand location.

718
01:12:22,248 --> 01:12:29,057
So both kind of imperfect options. Also mention the Larson Davis unit.

719
01:12:29,058 --> 01:12:33,408
So the one with the armband on it has what's called a tri axial accelerometer.

720
01:12:33,408 --> 01:12:37,788
This is the same thing you have in your phone. So it measures all three axes at the same time.

721
01:12:38,718 --> 01:12:44,208
The other unit that is got that enormous accelerometer on it, really.

722
01:12:44,688 --> 01:12:51,228
And so this one is kind of a low budget version of a vibration meter.

723
01:12:51,498 --> 01:12:55,287
And this giant accelerometer only measures one direction at a time.

724
01:12:55,288 --> 01:13:04,518
And so you'll see if you can see all the way in the back there, the mount here that you hold has as screw holes basically drilled in multiple axes.

725
01:13:05,268 --> 01:13:10,248
So I would screw the accelerometer into one axis, make my x axis measurement,

726
01:13:10,248 --> 01:13:15,258
then I unscrew the accelerometer, screw it into a different hole, and then I take my Z axis measurement.

727
01:13:15,268 --> 01:13:22,608
So it's cheap, it's clunky, it takes about three times as long to measure, but you get the same job done at the end of the day.

728
01:13:23,358 --> 01:13:24,718
So just two different options.

729
01:13:24,738 --> 01:13:33,377
I'll also say I did some research right after I was out of my own master's degree and looking at hand arm in whole body vibration in logging workers,

730
01:13:33,378 --> 01:13:39,857
as I said, and just kind of on a lark, we started to make measurements on the joysticks.

731
01:13:39,858 --> 01:13:43,488
So you saw in the video the guy operating the heavy equipment was running joysticks.

732
01:13:43,488 --> 01:13:45,798
And we're like, well, I wonder if the joysticks have exposure.

733
01:13:46,248 --> 01:13:53,627
And we demonstrated that even through the the suspended cab control joystick on these pieces of equipment,

734
01:13:53,628 --> 01:13:56,348
some of the equipment we were measuring was over the TLG.

735
01:13:56,838 --> 01:14:01,248
And this was something that people just hadn't thought about before, like shirt, a chainsaw, I get that.

736
01:14:01,248 --> 01:14:07,307
But a joystick and a heavy equipment. So again, the more we look, the more we find there are problems out there, everywhere.

737
01:14:07,308 --> 01:14:10,698
It's good job security, bad for the workers, of course.

738
01:14:12,288 --> 01:14:18,558
So just like whole body vibration, typically we're measuring broadband hand arm vibration here.

739
01:14:19,428 --> 01:14:27,348
Again, if you're ever in a position to rent or buy a vibration measurement instrument, whatever it costs,

740
01:14:27,348 --> 01:14:34,248
spend the extra money for the tri axial accelerometer so you can measure everything all at once instead of having to do three separate measurements,

741
01:14:34,248 --> 01:14:40,628
one for each axis. You know, just like it is for whole body vibration.

742
01:14:41,048 --> 01:14:50,528
Oftentimes what we're sort of interested in at the end of the day is what is the overall what we're total weighted acceleration across all three axes.

743
01:14:50,978 --> 01:14:56,348
And we express that again as the eight hour weighted acceleration of 48.

744
01:14:58,718 --> 01:15:04,838
So lots of different tools out there. As I mentioned, use everything from chain saws to hammers to grinders,

745
01:15:05,138 --> 01:15:10,507
impact drills, needle scaler as these things actually don't have so much vibration.

746
01:15:10,508 --> 01:15:16,328
But that's the type of equipment I was mentioning when I was talking with the refining turnaround workers who were like, Yeah,

747
01:15:16,328 --> 01:15:25,028
we're in these tanks chipping out or needling out residue with our our double hearing protection to ear plugs crammed in each year.

748
01:15:26,408 --> 01:15:28,807
So lots of vibration exposures out there.

749
01:15:28,808 --> 01:15:36,588
You know, some of the vibration, the instantaneous vibration, particularly for things like rumors, can be, you know, almost off the chart here.

750
01:15:36,608 --> 01:15:41,558
So remember, 9.81 meters per second squared is one G.

751
01:15:41,708 --> 01:15:47,078
So if you're operating some of these types of equipment, your hand is basically pulling three GS.

752
01:15:47,078 --> 01:15:48,848
That's a lot of acceleration.

753
01:15:49,688 --> 01:15:59,138
So, you know, many of these tools are relatively mild in their instantaneous acceleration, but some of them, again, can be extraordinarily high.

754
01:15:59,768 --> 01:16:03,548
And just like we saw with whole body vibration, you know,

755
01:16:03,548 --> 01:16:09,638
the chances of you having the equipment and training and the opportunity to go out and make measurements are probably pretty limited.

756
01:16:10,418 --> 01:16:12,798
But that doesn't mean you don't need to understand the problem.

757
01:16:12,798 --> 01:16:21,818
And so, once again, the U.S. Army has created and sort of continues to build a database that you can access.

758
01:16:21,848 --> 01:16:25,808
Now, the downside here is they're only measuring what the military is.

759
01:16:26,438 --> 01:16:30,358
So the military owns a lot of stuff in terms of equipment, but they don't own everything.

760
01:16:30,368 --> 01:16:34,087
So chances are if you're at a workplace and you're like, well,

761
01:16:34,088 --> 01:16:39,788
my worker is using a black and decker grinder or this particular model number, and you plug that in,

762
01:16:39,788 --> 01:16:42,038
it's probably not going to be into the data set here,

763
01:16:42,038 --> 01:16:47,718
but maybe there's another grinder in here and it's at least going to get you an idea of sort of what ballpark you're in.

764
01:16:47,738 --> 01:16:54,488
So a great resource and we just sort of want the military to continue to populate this.

765
01:16:56,518 --> 01:17:06,748
Now HGH does have a the for hand arm vibration and there to be again expressed as it our acceleration is five meters per second squared.

766
01:17:08,308 --> 01:17:11,818
And so I haven't done this for every one of the 12 as we talked about.

767
01:17:11,818 --> 01:17:20,278
But the two these are, as I did mentioned before, kind of scientifically based, best practice guidelines.

768
01:17:20,288 --> 01:17:25,258
They're they're designed without consideration of technical feasibility or cost.

769
01:17:25,558 --> 01:17:29,488
It's just what's the level that's safe for workers over time.

770
01:17:30,088 --> 01:17:34,948
And so the rationale for the hand arm vibration tlve is basically most of the workers who

771
01:17:34,948 --> 01:17:41,218
are exposed at this level of acceleration or less repeatedly over a working lifetime.

772
01:17:41,458 --> 01:17:47,608
Typically 40 years are not going to go past what's called stage one of the Stockholm scale.

773
01:17:47,618 --> 01:17:49,258
We'll come back to that in just a minute.

774
01:17:49,268 --> 01:17:56,428
So basically they're saying this is not 100% protective against any health outcomes, but the vast majority of workers,

775
01:17:56,818 --> 01:18:01,198
if they're exposed at this level or less, are not going to get severe disease from it.

776
01:18:02,098 --> 01:18:06,148
So that, you know, even without considering technical and economic feasibility,

777
01:18:06,148 --> 01:18:12,357
that's still not, hey, this is 100% safe, but it's a lot better than some of the EU directives,

778
01:18:12,358 --> 01:18:19,408
for instance, where they they don't necessarily even quantify what is the remaining risk, even if you're keeping your people below this.

779
01:18:19,408 --> 01:18:28,797
So at least HGH just sort of acknowledge that and excuse me, as HGH does for many of their limits, they have also set an action limit here.

780
01:18:28,798 --> 01:18:34,707
And so the eight hour acceleration weighted is two and a half meters per second squared.

781
01:18:34,708 --> 01:18:40,048
So they just cut the TLB in half and said we would love to keep people below that.

782
01:18:40,048 --> 01:18:42,868
Actually, that's more of a safe level there.

783
01:18:43,498 --> 01:18:53,278
And so if you're at the action level or less, the idea here is the risk of symptoms is very low to negligible for most workers that you're employing.

784
01:18:53,998 --> 01:18:57,687
And so we've got the same type of format that we looked at for whole body vibration.

785
01:18:57,688 --> 01:19:02,608
So we've got duration here from 15 minutes a day all the way up to 8 hours a day.

786
01:19:03,838 --> 01:19:10,258
And then for each of those exposure times, we've got a till value and then an action limit value.

787
01:19:10,258 --> 01:19:15,478
That's half of the field. So again, if I if I had a task and I'm like, I need to use a chainsaw,

788
01:19:15,478 --> 01:19:21,027
but it's only 15 minutes a day, well, then I, you know, I'm not interested in the eight hour average.

789
01:19:21,028 --> 01:19:27,087
I'm going to figure out, well, how much can I actually be exposed to for 15 minutes and here for 15 minutes or less,

790
01:19:27,088 --> 01:19:31,167
the 12 year is up around the high end of what we saw on that graph.

791
01:19:31,168 --> 01:19:39,748
We looked at a moment ago, almost 30 meters per second squared. But of course, the longer I'm getting exposed, the less intense my exposure can be.

792
01:19:39,748 --> 01:19:44,578
So that's very similar to noise and whole body vibration and and other physical hazards.

793
01:19:45,268 --> 01:19:51,598
And then just like with whole body vibration, HGH has presented this not only as a table, but also as a graph.

794
01:19:52,288 --> 01:19:56,398
So again, this this whole region of the graph here above the TV is the no go zone.

795
01:19:56,398 --> 01:20:05,668
We don't want anybody ever exposed in that region. The region below the action limit here we are not concerned about that's the safe region.

796
01:20:05,818 --> 01:20:14,878
And then the the area between these two curves is the area where we need to have surveillance and other sort of vibration control measures in place.

797
01:20:16,318 --> 01:20:20,457
I'll also say, you know, the graph is pretty convenient and it's broken down to where I could say,

798
01:20:20,458 --> 01:20:24,357
all right, I've got an exposure that's 6 hours and 10 minutes long.

799
01:20:24,358 --> 01:20:28,168
Let me figure out what my allowable exposure level is from the graph,

800
01:20:28,498 --> 01:20:32,398
where there's an equation that lets you do that too, just like we talked about for noise.

801
01:20:34,918 --> 01:20:40,708
So if I want to actually deploy that equation, let's say I've got a worker and you know,

802
01:20:40,798 --> 01:20:44,728
maybe I looked up the Army website and oh my God, there actually was a perfect match.

803
01:20:45,118 --> 01:20:51,208
And so this worker is using a tool that has an eight meters per second squared internal vibration level.

804
01:20:52,468 --> 01:20:59,218
And so the question here is, well, how long could my work would be exposed if they're working with this particular tool?

805
01:20:59,218 --> 01:21:04,468
So what's their allowable exposure time? I want to normalize this to 8 hours.

806
01:21:04,468 --> 01:21:10,017
I need to know the measured acceleration and my limit here is five meters per second squared.

807
01:21:10,018 --> 01:21:19,738
That's the TLB. And so if I run through that equation there, I figure out my worker can be exposed for exactly 3.1 to 5 hours at that level.

808
01:21:20,338 --> 01:21:27,268
And again, I could do the same thing with the chart here and just sort of find a and draw a line over.

809
01:21:27,388 --> 01:21:33,088
And I'm not very good at drawing lines on screens and figure out, okay, that's about 3.1 2 hours.

810
01:21:33,778 --> 01:21:39,088
So so that's one way we can determine our exposure according to the TLB.

811
01:21:39,838 --> 01:21:47,638
Now, the EU regulation in this case is essentially identical to the TLB, though it was different for whole body vibration.

812
01:21:48,478 --> 01:21:55,287
And so here again in the EU and the key here is the ECJ, age limits are not required, right?

813
01:21:55,288 --> 01:22:02,788
They're a recommendation. Whereas these European Union directives are regulations, they're the law, they're enforceable there.

814
01:22:02,788 --> 01:22:08,338
So they have essentially the same limit, but it's got the power of law behind it instead of just being a guideline.

815
01:22:09,298 --> 01:22:14,998
And so in Europe, if you're at the exposure limit value of five meters per second squared,

816
01:22:14,998 --> 01:22:20,998
they say you need to put in technical and organizational measures, in other words, to try to reduce exposures.

817
01:22:22,228 --> 01:22:25,858
And if you're at the action value of two and a half meters per second squared,

818
01:22:26,008 --> 01:22:34,678
they say you should at least be giving people PPE to get them below, even if you don't have some of the other organizational concepts in place.

819
01:22:37,108 --> 01:22:43,918
So given that the ECJ age and the EU guidelines are virtually identical here, we can start to ask a question like, well,

820
01:22:44,398 --> 01:22:49,468
let's say I've got a worker and this workers exposed for 4 hours a day and the

821
01:22:49,498 --> 01:22:53,268
tooling they're using has a vibration level of five meters per second squared.

822
01:22:53,278 --> 01:22:56,908
Are they okay or is that too much exposure?

823
01:22:56,998 --> 01:23:01,348
So, you know, I can look on the graph here and I could say, well, five meters per second per day,

824
01:23:02,458 --> 01:23:08,038
I can draw it over to my line here and see they'd be at the actual limit basically after a couple of hours,

825
01:23:08,878 --> 01:23:15,028
but they wouldn't be into the telly until probably six or 7 hours.

826
01:23:15,038 --> 01:23:20,847
So the the sort of takeaway message here would be this person is is under the TLB,

827
01:23:20,848 --> 01:23:25,138
but they are essentially at the actual limit for that particular exposure.

828
01:23:25,648 --> 01:23:33,748
So they are not up in our unacceptable range here, but they are into the range where we're somewhat concerned about this exposure.

829
01:23:35,738 --> 01:23:41,048
So I talked about the health effects of whole body vibration. Let's talk about what hand arm vibration gets to the body.

830
01:23:41,978 --> 01:23:47,258
And it's it's not such a whole system or whole body impact, as you might expect.

831
01:23:47,618 --> 01:23:55,838
And I don't know what genius came up with this name, but they've called the health effects from the hand our vibration hand arm vibration syndrome or.

832
01:23:56,318 --> 01:24:00,217
Yes. And so if you were to pick up a tool for the first time,

833
01:24:00,218 --> 01:24:05,528
a vibrating tool and use it for some period of time, in fact, we'll look at that in a few minutes.

834
01:24:06,398 --> 01:24:12,788
But if this was an overexposure, if you were over the top, for instance, and you're using this thing for long enough,

835
01:24:13,328 --> 01:24:19,777
the first things you would start to notice would be essentially tingling or numbness in your fingers, specifically your fingertips.

836
01:24:19,778 --> 01:24:22,238
That's the part that's coming into contact with the tool.

837
01:24:22,838 --> 01:24:28,568
I will say this is not carpal tunnel syndrome which can sometimes have similar health impacts.

838
01:24:28,838 --> 01:24:33,428
And in fact, it's not uncommon to get hindering vibration syndrome and carpal tunnel at the same time.

839
01:24:33,428 --> 01:24:35,648
But they are two distinct diseases.

840
01:24:37,118 --> 01:24:43,447
So if you stopped using the tool at that point and said It's not normal for my fingers to jiggle, I need to find a new job, great.

841
01:24:43,448 --> 01:24:46,748
You've just prevented any longer term consequences.

842
01:24:46,988 --> 01:24:54,578
But like the All the Loggers did back in the 1960s when they first got chainsaws, if you kept kind of working through it,

843
01:24:55,118 --> 01:25:00,847
the next thing you would start to see is a blanched fingertip or even an entire blanched finger.

844
01:25:00,848 --> 01:25:04,658
And so on this worker's hand, you can see the pinky here is blanched.

845
01:25:05,228 --> 01:25:11,828
The blood flow has been disrupted to this particular finger once this blanching starts to occur.

846
01:25:12,128 --> 01:25:15,878
Now we're getting into sort of the irreversible disease process.

847
01:25:16,058 --> 01:25:23,878
It's not very far along at this point. A couple of other words for this Vaso spasm or some of you may know of Raynaud's phenomenon,

848
01:25:23,888 --> 01:25:28,778
it's actually a non occupational illness that's much more common in women than men.

849
01:25:29,648 --> 01:25:35,438
And so you can get blanching and numbness and tingling primarily from cold temperatures.

850
01:25:36,518 --> 01:25:39,728
So that can occur naturally, spontaneously.

851
01:25:40,088 --> 01:25:45,848
But renowned phenomenon of occupational origin is specifically tied to vibration here.

852
01:25:46,268 --> 01:25:50,978
And the other sort of note name that people give this is vibration white finger.

853
01:25:51,848 --> 01:25:54,158
And so again, this disease,

854
01:25:54,158 --> 01:26:02,798
Raynaud's does have natural occurrence and it's something like 5% of the U.S. population has this just naturally without any vibration exposure.

855
01:26:03,638 --> 01:26:07,788
It's like two and a half percent in men and like 7% in women.

856
01:26:07,808 --> 01:26:10,898
So some some sex differences there.

857
01:26:12,128 --> 01:26:17,888
Now, if you discontinue your exposure, that that vibration right finger is not going to get any worse.

858
01:26:17,888 --> 01:26:24,578
But if again, you continue exposure in your exposing yourself, you'll move past the original condition,

859
01:26:24,578 --> 01:26:31,088
which is usually that that white finger happens with vibration exposure and it's much more likely in cold.

860
01:26:31,868 --> 01:26:35,347
So what happens in cold you get vasodilation all of our excuse me,

861
01:26:35,348 --> 01:26:42,128
you get veins of constriction and your blood essentially is moved from your extremities into your core to try to keep you warm.

862
01:26:42,128 --> 01:26:44,318
That's what all of you will experience all winter long.

863
01:26:45,968 --> 01:26:53,797
And so if your blood flow is already sort of been restricted to your extremities and you're adding in the vibration, you know, it sort of makes sense.

864
01:26:53,798 --> 01:26:59,758
That's a double whammy here. This is sometimes mistaken for frostbite, but frostbite is because, of course,

865
01:26:59,768 --> 01:27:08,738
physical damage from freezing of the tissues early on in the process here, these white finger attacks can last maybe 5 to 15 minutes.

866
01:27:08,738 --> 01:27:13,958
They're very sporadic. They're not regularly spaced and so quite infrequent.

867
01:27:14,768 --> 01:27:21,158
Now, again, if you discontinue at this point, the the damage isn't going to get any worse, but it's not going to get any better.

868
01:27:21,158 --> 01:27:28,568
You're still going to start to get this blanching and cold. But if you continue your vibration exposure, the attacks are going to get more frequent.

869
01:27:29,078 --> 01:27:30,427
They're going to last longer.

870
01:27:30,428 --> 01:27:37,298
They may become painful instead of just sort of numbness and tingling, and they'll start to spread to other fingers as well.

871
01:27:37,568 --> 01:27:38,738
So you can start to see, you know,

872
01:27:38,738 --> 01:27:45,307
we've got the initial one finger and then it starts to spread maybe to adjacent fingers or it started in the fingertips.

873
01:27:45,308 --> 01:27:51,848
It will start to extend to the entire finger and it will start to happen in all temperatures, not just in color.

874
01:27:53,168 --> 01:27:56,738
So, again, a very progressive disease here.

875
01:27:56,738 --> 01:28:07,988
If the exposure continues now, you can get past sort of vascular issues into more, let's see, nerve based impacts.

876
01:28:07,988 --> 01:28:14,318
You can start to get lots of coordination and dexterity and damage to your muscles is going to result in loss of grip strength.

877
01:28:15,008 --> 01:28:25,568
And this, you know, if if left to progress so the exposure continues it can start to lead to bone damage and we don't see cases like this anymore.

878
01:28:25,568 --> 01:28:27,187
But back in the 1960s, again,

879
01:28:27,188 --> 01:28:33,938
when chainsaws were new and you imagine the kinds of climates in the U.S. where people cut a lot of wood, you know, imagine.

880
01:28:34,598 --> 01:28:37,928
The Northwest people are working in the winter in very cold conditions.

881
01:28:38,828 --> 01:28:42,037
They would get to the point where the damage was so extreme to their fingers that

882
01:28:42,038 --> 01:28:46,628
they would get gangrene and basically lose fingers as a result of this vibration.

883
01:28:47,408 --> 01:28:52,748
So the key here is it's not like you pick up the tool and on the second day you're using it, you're getting gangrene.

884
01:28:52,758 --> 01:28:58,538
This is a process that takes often years, you know, months at a bare minimum.

885
01:28:59,318 --> 01:29:06,878
And then one other thing to consider. So we've talked about how cold causes vasoconstriction, and we'll go into that in more detail in two lectures.

886
01:29:07,418 --> 01:29:12,998
And we've talked about how vibration can sort of amplify the results of that.

887
01:29:12,998 --> 01:29:17,258
And then the other thing that reduces blood flow to your extremities is nicotine.

888
01:29:18,368 --> 01:29:24,578
So if you imagine the kind of worker who's working outdoors under really harsh conditions in the wintertime,

889
01:29:24,908 --> 01:29:28,868
and you think, well, maybe that worker is more likely to be a smoker, you're absolutely right.

890
01:29:28,898 --> 01:29:34,507
So we think the cold, the vibration and the nicotine exposure is like a triple whammy on these workers,

891
01:29:34,508 --> 01:29:38,948
putting them at much increased risk of getting vibration wake finger.

892
01:29:39,878 --> 01:29:45,068
So that ought to sort of immediately identify well, there's a couple of places we can intervene here and cut down this risk.

893
01:29:46,538 --> 01:29:50,378
I mentioned the Stockholm scale, so there was a conference held.

894
01:29:50,718 --> 01:29:54,908
I'm trying to remember the year I went to say this was back in the early 1970s, maybe,

895
01:29:55,388 --> 01:30:02,648
where researchers from around the world got together and they were trying to sort of codify what do we mean when we say hands on vibration syndrome,

896
01:30:02,648 --> 01:30:06,098
what are the symptoms and how do we classify the severity?

897
01:30:06,878 --> 01:30:08,378
And so from this workshop,

898
01:30:08,378 --> 01:30:18,968
they came up with a five point scale for vascular impacts and then a four point scale for sensorineural impacts from hand arm vibration.

899
01:30:18,998 --> 01:30:23,168
So stage zero is like your grade, perfectly healthy, no impacts.

900
01:30:23,588 --> 01:30:29,438
And then with each increasing stage, the attacks are either getting more often or they're getting more severe.

901
01:30:30,158 --> 01:30:34,357
Until the time we get to stage four. Here, you're getting frequent attacks.

902
01:30:34,358 --> 01:30:38,738
They're affecting every component of most of your fingers.

903
01:30:39,218 --> 01:30:45,428
And stage four, you're starting to get trophic changes to maybe some death precursors to gangrene there.

904
01:30:46,058 --> 01:30:50,678
So a higher stage here is its worse health outcome basically.

905
01:30:50,978 --> 01:30:54,548
And I'll point out that you do separate staging for each hand.

906
01:30:54,668 --> 01:30:59,498
So it's quite common for the exposures to your two hands to be different.

907
01:31:00,018 --> 01:31:02,798
You may have much worse impacts in one hand than the other.

908
01:31:04,028 --> 01:31:12,518
And then in terms of sensorineural impacts, so we've got a 0% rating here, which is basically you have exposure but you don't have any symptoms.

909
01:31:13,028 --> 01:31:23,648
And then increasing up to, you know, intermittent two to less intermittent, more regular, persistent numbness, reduced dexterity.

910
01:31:23,648 --> 01:31:28,868
I'll also tell you, there are a number of super unpleasant tests that they do to diagnose this condition.

911
01:31:29,288 --> 01:31:33,788
So you guys have probably remember the ice bucket challenge from a couple of years ago.

912
01:31:34,058 --> 01:31:39,517
They basically do that where they plunge the worker's hand into a bucket of ice and they see how much it blanches.

913
01:31:39,518 --> 01:31:48,278
After 30 seconds of exposure, they'll take pins to pins and put them quite close together and see how far apart do the pins

914
01:31:48,278 --> 01:31:53,228
have to be before the worker can detect that there's two pins is a measure of skin sensitivity.

915
01:31:53,618 --> 01:31:57,638
They do imgs with needles, all sorts of really unpleasant tests.

916
01:31:59,898 --> 01:32:06,618
So, you know, this is one of the diseases where there's actually a huge amount of literature that erupted just in the 1960s and seventies,

917
01:32:06,798 --> 01:32:09,438
you know, based largely on these chainsaw operators.

918
01:32:09,828 --> 01:32:17,328
We're now we've got statistical models that say, what is your exposure and how long are you exposed?

919
01:32:17,808 --> 01:32:23,207
And then we can sort of make some educated guesses as to are you sort of the 10th

920
01:32:23,208 --> 01:32:27,738
percentile most vulnerable worker or any closer to sort of the median worker,

921
01:32:28,578 --> 01:32:32,208
maybe based on family history of renewables, etc.?

922
01:32:32,808 --> 01:32:42,138
And so you can see here, if you've got a a chainsaw with a vibration level up in, let's see, the 30 meters per second squared acceleration,

923
01:32:42,588 --> 01:32:53,358
it's going to be probably less than a year before you start to get sort of meaningful changes in your hand or vibration syndrome.

924
01:32:53,748 --> 01:33:00,138
On the other hand, if you've got a very low exposure level of let's say two meters per second squared, you know, you could do that.

925
01:33:00,618 --> 01:33:05,628
You could use that equipment daily for 15 years before you ever start to get into it.

926
01:33:05,988 --> 01:33:13,668
So like with almost everything in environmental health, it's a combination of how long are you doing it and how intense is the exposure.

927
01:33:15,228 --> 01:33:20,798
Now see here, there are different types of guidance available to us from different countries.

928
01:33:20,808 --> 01:33:24,048
This actually comes out of the United Kingdom again.

929
01:33:24,738 --> 01:33:31,248
I like this because it's kind of the, you know, stop leitmotif here, unless you're red, green, colorblind, in which case it's terrible.

930
01:33:32,448 --> 01:33:39,978
But it's sort of, you know, how it essentially quantifies your exposure in terms of points.

931
01:33:40,308 --> 01:33:43,517
And we don't need to get into the the grading system, basically,

932
01:33:43,518 --> 01:33:48,978
but then it takes those points and divides them into the Green Zone where it's like, you don't really have a problem here.

933
01:33:48,978 --> 01:33:54,137
You can do this 8 hours a day without concern. The yellow zone, which is like, well, this is a medium problem.

934
01:33:54,138 --> 01:33:59,717
Maybe we're sort of in the action limit area here. And then the red zone where it's like you you can't do this for 8 hours.

935
01:33:59,718 --> 01:34:05,388
You might not even be able to do this for a couple of minutes a day without risking some sort of health outcome.

936
01:34:06,078 --> 01:34:12,767
So I really like these sort of visual guides. Again, the underlying math here is probably not something you want to communicate to workers,

937
01:34:12,768 --> 01:34:16,968
but the red, yellow, green motif is is great for training people.

938
01:34:17,358 --> 01:34:23,448
So if, for instance, you replace the numbers with like a picture of a tool, you could communicate very quickly.

939
01:34:23,448 --> 01:34:27,108
Oh, I'm using that tool today and that's in the red zone. That's that's not good for me.

940
01:34:28,758 --> 01:34:34,518
Now, in terms of controlling hand arm vibration, there has been a huge eruption, I would say,

941
01:34:34,518 --> 01:34:40,188
in the number of so-called anti vibration tools that are on the market that started with chainsaws,

942
01:34:40,188 --> 01:34:42,528
but now it's extended to lots of other types of tools.

943
01:34:43,008 --> 01:34:49,908
Now I will highlight if you go to a Home Depot and Lowe's or any other hardware store, you'll see a lot of tools that are labeled ergonomic.

944
01:34:50,268 --> 01:34:55,128
That does not mean anti vibration ergonomic just refers to the position of your wrist.

945
01:34:55,128 --> 01:35:02,268
Basically, when you're using the tool, there are some tools that are ergonomic and anti-migration, but not all of them.

946
01:35:03,138 --> 01:35:08,568
I'll also highlight there are a lot of companies that will sell something called a tool handle wrap.

947
01:35:09,198 --> 01:35:16,998
So the idea is, gosh, my tool handle is vibrating. Let me wrap it basically with bandages, you know, cut down on the vibration transmission.

948
01:35:17,238 --> 01:35:21,797
So that sounds maybe like a good idea. But when you think about it, when you put that tool wrap on,

949
01:35:21,798 --> 01:35:26,537
you go from maybe sort of the power graph where you've got a lot of control on a

950
01:35:26,538 --> 01:35:31,908
very relatively slender handle to now the tool grip is like this big because you've

951
01:35:31,908 --> 01:35:35,837
wrapped it so many times and now you've created an ergonomic problem and you haven't

952
01:35:35,838 --> 01:35:39,348
solved the vibration problem because the tool wraps don't work in the first place,

953
01:35:39,648 --> 01:35:44,957
so don't invest in those if that's ever a possibility for you, you know, just sharpening your tools,

954
01:35:44,958 --> 01:35:50,298
if you imagine a saw sort of smoothly cutting through wood versus hammering through the wood with a dull blade,

955
01:35:50,298 --> 01:35:56,927
you're going to get a lot less vibration with the sharp blade, a great solution, especially for heavier tools.

956
01:35:56,928 --> 01:36:00,768
So this person is using an impact wrench to take lug nuts off a wheel.

957
01:36:01,488 --> 01:36:03,768
The impact wrench may weigh £30.

958
01:36:04,188 --> 01:36:11,388
And so if I'm trying to support the weight of the tool and control it, I'm going to be gripping that tool super tightly.

959
01:36:11,388 --> 01:36:16,218
And that's just sort of amplifying the ability of the vibration to get into my hand.

960
01:36:16,788 --> 01:36:20,658
Whereas if I suspend the tool now, I don't have to hold the weight, I just have to direct it.

961
01:36:20,658 --> 01:36:26,208
I don't have to have such a tight grip and the looser grip is basically going to attenuate that vibration.

962
01:36:28,818 --> 01:36:34,767
Here's a video I'll show you again. Chainsaw is sort of the classic bad actor for vibration.

963
01:36:34,768 --> 01:36:38,028
And so this is how they design an anti vibration chainsaw.

964
01:36:40,548 --> 01:36:46,638
No audio here. But you can see the the motor here is creating the power that's moving the blade.

965
01:36:46,638 --> 01:36:52,998
The motor moves around a fair amount and in a historical chainsaw the motor would just be strapped directly to the handle.

966
01:36:52,998 --> 01:36:58,248
But here you can see they put in essentially two springs to insulate the handle from the motor.

967
01:36:58,578 --> 01:37:02,687
They've got another one around the drive for the chain here and all.

968
01:37:02,688 --> 01:37:09,028
And then a few other mounts between the or anti-migration mounts between the case of the equipment and

969
01:37:09,498 --> 01:37:15,467
and and the operator and all of that results in the motor vibrates just as much as an old one does,

970
01:37:15,468 --> 01:37:20,178
but the handle vibrates very, very little because it's been essentially isolated from the motor.

971
01:37:20,598 --> 01:37:28,248
So these things are really magical and they've taken chainsaw levels down from like 35 to 40 meters per second squared down to more like 5 to 7.

972
01:37:29,388 --> 01:37:36,197
Still a problem, but nowhere near as bad as it used to be. We can think about administrative controls here.

973
01:37:36,198 --> 01:37:40,277
So I've already touched on this just gripping the tool as loosely as possible.

974
01:37:40,278 --> 01:37:48,618
You know, if you have a death grip, you're just making it easier for that vibration to get into your hand and maybe your forearm and elbow and,

975
01:37:48,618 --> 01:37:52,888
you know, put the tool down whenever it's practical, especially if it doesn't turn off.

976
01:37:52,908 --> 01:37:56,328
It's constantly vibrating. Well, I don't want to be holding it any more than I have to.

977
01:37:57,198 --> 01:38:00,468
You know, the idea of just limiting tool use time or saying, hey, you know,

978
01:38:00,468 --> 01:38:05,838
we we got to take a break every 45 minutes and put the tool down, give everybody a chance to recover.

979
01:38:07,188 --> 01:38:12,308
You know, when it comes to to jack hammers, you know, he came in he's not here today.

980
01:38:12,308 --> 01:38:17,748
He mentioned like, well, not every jackhammer can do the job. And I mentioned that for four jackhammers.

981
01:38:17,748 --> 01:38:25,458
A lot of the noise from pneumatic or air power jackhammers comes from the air ejecting out of the cylinder each time it fires.

982
01:38:25,938 --> 01:38:32,328
And another huge problem of jackhammers is that exhaust often exhausts right over the workers hands.

983
01:38:32,868 --> 01:38:36,197
So now you've got vibration and you're blowing cold air across it too.

984
01:38:36,198 --> 01:38:41,417
We already talked about how that's bad. So not using pneumatic tools, replacing them with electric,

985
01:38:41,418 --> 01:38:48,018
or making sure that the air from the pneumatic tool is not getting vented directly under the worker's hands is a good idea.

986
01:38:48,648 --> 01:38:53,358
You know, we can think about rotating workers between the vibration jobs and the non vibration jobs.

987
01:38:54,048 --> 01:38:58,308
Here is where sort of other wellness programs like, Hey, let's not smoke here.

988
01:38:58,308 --> 01:39:04,908
While we're also working in cold with hand, arm vibration exposure, that's going to reduce our risk dramatically.

989
01:39:05,358 --> 01:39:10,667
And then, of course, surveillance and monitoring. We want to check in with workers and make sure things aren't changing for the worse.

990
01:39:10,668 --> 01:39:17,298
Yeah, well what would be up I we'll get to that in just a minute.

991
01:39:17,298 --> 01:39:23,478
Actually, you're just a slide ahead of me. Before we mention that, though, let me just show you another quick video here.

992
01:39:23,478 --> 01:39:28,488
So just any of you is a sample under the BJP system,

993
01:39:28,548 --> 01:39:35,428
monitors and monitors the emerging migrations in the case of increase migration, duration of each individual,

994
01:39:35,448 --> 01:39:42,108
individual separated, and then in the operation when they reached zero,

995
01:39:42,118 --> 01:39:47,618
you need to have a power equivalent coupling group when it's in when it's attached.

996
01:39:47,628 --> 01:39:56,388
Correct. The host that you want to talk to is a program rate you might be choosing not to use.

997
01:39:56,948 --> 01:40:02,058
The program won't be want to see the opportunity images which red light red light illuminates.

998
01:40:02,418 --> 01:40:09,558
So kind of a commercial solution where it's not something the worker wears, it lives on the tool and then the worker can be informed, Hey,

999
01:40:09,558 --> 01:40:16,158
I've used this tool for so long and it's telling me I can't have any more vibration exposure and they're just wrapping up and coming to to village.

1000
01:40:16,158 --> 01:40:23,028
Question here about PPE. So really gloves are the only type of PPE that's marketed for hand arm vibration.

1001
01:40:24,618 --> 01:40:33,498
I will say a lot of these gloves that are marketed as anti hand arm vibration are fingerless gloves and it's like, well, what?

1002
01:40:33,498 --> 01:40:37,697
Where does the disease start with hand arm vibration syndrome? It starts in the fingertips.

1003
01:40:37,698 --> 01:40:42,948
And you're telling me this product that's designed to prevent that doesn't have coverage on the fingertips, these are terrible.

1004
01:40:43,398 --> 01:40:48,648
So at a minimum, if you get an anti vibration glove, you want to make sure it's a whole glove, not these fingerless things.

1005
01:40:49,068 --> 01:40:55,547
And even the best case scenario, a really good anti-immigration glove is going to cut down maybe ten or 15% of your exposure.

1006
01:40:55,548 --> 01:41:01,068
So it's not like you're going to fix the problem if you've got a very high exposure just by slapping gloves on.

1007
01:41:01,818 --> 01:41:07,547
Also, gloves are pretty good, just as the human hand is itself at absorbing the high frequency stuff.

1008
01:41:07,548 --> 01:41:11,328
But the low frequency will go right through the gloves into your shoulders.

1009
01:41:12,288 --> 01:41:18,738
And the thing that makes these gloves kind of magic is they have either some kind of liquid or some sort of gel in little pads.

1010
01:41:18,738 --> 01:41:25,188
If any of you have bicycling gloves, they're very similar just to sort of provide a little insulation between your hand and the handle.

1011
01:41:25,998 --> 01:41:33,498
I will say, though, innovation, gloves, mostly a scam, but any kind of glove is a good idea because you're going to add warmth.

1012
01:41:33,978 --> 01:41:40,188
You're going to keep water off the worker's hand. So keeping them warm and dry is going to cut down on that visual constriction.

1013
01:41:41,508 --> 01:41:48,378
I will say cotton and leather gloves, like most work gloves are, really don't provide any attenuation against vibration at all.

1014
01:41:48,378 --> 01:41:53,087
So gloves really are the last line of defense and they're not a particularly good one to boot.

1015
01:41:53,088 --> 01:41:56,118
So that's that's my my take on gloves. And it's not just me.

1016
01:41:56,118 --> 01:42:04,488
In fact, there was this study published a few years ago. It just basically trashed anti vibration gloves after review of the literature.

1017
01:42:04,488 --> 01:42:07,757
So, you know, and see what's highlighted here.

1018
01:42:07,758 --> 01:42:14,448
Ultimately, antibody racing gloves cannot be relied on to provide sufficient and consistent protection to the wearer before their use is contemplated.

1019
01:42:14,448 --> 01:42:22,788
All other means of vibration control by first to be implemented, you know, basically just announcing the hierarchy of controls there.

1020
01:42:23,358 --> 01:42:27,108
All right. We're at time here while you guys are packing up. I'm just going to play this one last.

1021
01:42:59,928 --> 01:43:03,988
We allowed it. I remember. Sorry. Okay. So. So that's it for today.

1022
01:43:04,408 --> 01:43:07,977
Apologies for going in a minute over here. I will see you in class next week.

1023
01:43:07,978 --> 01:43:12,958
We'll talk about non-ionizing radiation. And in the meantime, have a wonderful Thanksgiving break, everybody.

1024
01:43:13,228 --> 01:43:13,558
Thanks.
