1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:11,310
Non-communicable diseases, also known as chronic disease, tend to be a long duration and other results are full.

2
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:17,040
Sure. Make sure I'm recording this. It's Larry's.

3
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:25,830
As the results of a compilation of genetic, physiological, environmental and behavior factors.

4
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:31,320
This is the evolution and to the long communique.

5
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:40,710
I'd say if you think about our recent and most recent public house experience,

6
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:51,480
we have also some infectious diseases that could really be the cause course, you know, long duration.

7
00:00:52,080 --> 00:01:04,440
And so in other words, the lung communicable disease mini 13 to the category of chronic diseases.

8
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:11,880
But there are also some infectious disease that cause chronic infection.

9
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,790
Would you call that chronic disease?

10
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:24,120
Maybe by habits, by people, the general practice of the don't you recall the infectious disease as a chronic disease?

11
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:31,160
But they are many chronic disease. Due to infection.

12
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:39,860
And then some of the chronic infection could also result in this traditional little known.

13
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:49,300
Noncommunicable diseases are chronic diseases such as different types of cancers caused by infectious diseases.

14
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:56,450
So just so this evolution here is not complete.

15
00:01:56,470 --> 00:02:04,720
They define the chronic disease, but it's fine for non-communicable diseases.

16
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:10,720
Excuse me, Professor. We can't see your slides. Okay.

17
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:16,500
Let me see. Sorry. I may have not seen you since.

18
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:25,930
Today's high. Some people told me I couldn't.

19
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:30,459
I suggest to cancel, to discuss and make a recording.

20
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:33,640
But I thought I could still try it.

21
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:39,910
But apparently it's not. I was reading facts.

22
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:50,940
Okay. Let me share the screen here. Do you see the slides on your are you able to see?

23
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:57,460
By the way, I just want to make sure that when I upload that we're on your camera sense.

24
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:02,040
Yeah. They're available on the campus site. Okay. Okay.

25
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:14,190
Good. Yeah, because I had that incident so I couldn't really uploads until the broke.

26
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:24,270
So I talked about the W.H.O. certification here and I want to one specific comments on this different nations.

27
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:39,700
While many noncommunicable diseases fits into the chronic disease category and the chronic diseases have been generally considered as one diseases.

28
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:48,840
But with our recent experience and also previous experience,

29
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:58,950
we know a lump of flu infectious diseases actually also cause chronic disease and not just chronic infection,

30
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:13,229
but also cause cancer, which is traditionally defined and generally defined as chronic disease.

31
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:18,090
So there is the infectious cause of chronic disease.

32
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:31,080
It's not just non-communicable. So this is one remark I want to make then current global non-communicable disease burden.

33
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:44,460
Yeah. As I say, the main motivation to develop the cause is because I saw a shift and kind of forgetting some important infectious diseases.

34
00:04:44,880 --> 00:05:00,000
It's that the high opening up that was largely driven by the greedy increase in global non-communicable diseases burden as summarized in these slides.

35
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:14,549
This is from W issues, facts, fact sheets. And I remember the updates these greedy number four condition had for the I hate to change the

36
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:26,730
numbers for this year's cross cancer the increase like cancer does respiratory disease deaths by

37
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:38,040
beating or increased so that's the current global situation impacts the people mostly between

38
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:47,670
30 and 70 records of premature deaths occurring in mostly in low and middle income countries.

39
00:05:47,940 --> 00:06:03,240
So this is why you could see more public health attention given to were given to the non-communicable diseases because a lot of premature deaths,

40
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:08,940
it's also associated with low and middle income countries.

41
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:20,550
So they are facing more challenges because they then develop the countries because they have to really address both burdens,

42
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:24,840
infectious disease for them and the non-communicable diseases burden.

43
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:33,570
But there has been a trend that's, you know, gets more attention to non-communicable diseases,

44
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:42,540
which you could, you know, cause the increase for infectious disease burden.

45
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:49,229
And the risk factors were typically before long,

46
00:06:49,230 --> 00:07:03,930
communicable disease were high for one category called the modifiable behavior risk factors like what you can see from here and tobacco use.

47
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:18,360
That's where we realize that unhealthy diet, that's definitely harmful use of alcohol, basically inactivity or this can contribute to the.

48
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:24,850
Incidents increased and also the.

49
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:29,010
That's a communicable disease.

50
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:42,310
And isn't that the mechanism why those this behavior or risk factors can come back.

51
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:54,140
I risk factors for communicable diseases because a number of them could contribute to them would have metabolic risk factors.

52
00:07:54,440 --> 00:08:02,720
Basically those factors contributes to the increase of metabolic to risk factors.

53
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:12,190
That includes risk of blood pressure, overweight, obesity, hypoglycemia.

54
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:19,610
I had to leave the mirror and the pub sleep cause more.

55
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:24,900
Change some other than if you look at the.

56
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:33,230
US contact this is a CDC certification includes a truly important component.

57
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:46,040
Once conditions at the last a year or more and require ongoing medical attention or limiting activities of daily living or posts.

58
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:56,150
So this is the CDC and to the full the United States, the one major leading cause of the deaths.

59
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:11,460
It's heart disease, cancer, diabetes. They are all chronic disease and the chronic disease and the non-communicable diseases.

60
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:17,309
But as I mentioned, while cancer and the heart disease,

61
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:31,020
some heart condition could be a result of infections like COVID 19 could cause some heart condition and the HIV infection AIDS,

62
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:41,730
a source of the malignancy contributes to the cancer burden and then TB diabetes codes.

63
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:47,080
You know, we used to say TB, HIV, co-morbidity.

64
00:09:47,250 --> 00:10:02,650
It's the importance of public. Focus group is now the new mentioning in the literature is TV by beating or TV HIV type.

65
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:09,400
This is triple the burden that the citizens have to be focused on.

66
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:19,990
So these are all hyperlinks. While we hope these chronic conditions can be linked to some infectious causes.

67
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:32,349
And while these chronic diseases, especially cancer and diabetes, can also increase the risk for infection and to the diabetes,

68
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:43,810
the pharmacy compromised hosting immunity has compromised immunity for the number of reasons we wear that were discussed later.

69
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:50,440
So these are the three major causes of the test for us.

70
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:57,260
Chronic disease, including. Including.

71
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:03,690
You know, the chronic disease caused by infectious agents.

72
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:11,430
So when you think about prevention and control for communicable disease, reducing the.

73
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:18,850
These are the major principles that are used to promote science.

74
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:24,550
But are reduces the risk factors associated with these diseases.

75
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:28,690
And the WTO lists a number of major risk factors.

76
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:38,979
But the more recent literature that I mentioned, some of the changes may not so much lifestyle change, like,

77
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:47,470
for example, for diabetes lifestyle change where that can contribute to the reduction of the disease in.

78
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:54,950
Many populations, but it may not solve the problem completely.

79
00:11:55,370 --> 00:12:04,309
There is. Recent studies have shown some epigenetic change due to early childhood,

80
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:14,060
early life exposure to friends making up for new foods that's caused some epigenetic change.

81
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:19,910
This contributes to increase the risk of diabetes for those individuals.

82
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:24,260
The lifestyle change may not make an impact.

83
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:31,480
So we hypertension is some more detailed discussion on that topic later on.

84
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:44,689
Investing in medicine, management, food and seeds, detection screening, treatment of citizen healthy and people care.

85
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:59,240
This is also an important aspect. And so for more extensive information on the W.H.O. Global Action Plan, I recommend the two.

86
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:08,959
Read this, or you can just browse through some of the chapters of these documents where enhance

87
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:14,540
your understanding of to go through and see this situation and action plan.

88
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:18,800
This plan apparently had four also in Tucson, 19.

89
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:30,200
This is the mutual group action plan has been expanded to another for another ten years until 2030.

90
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:40,880
I think that the review after the outcome of this plan had shown this importance of still needs and strategies.

91
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:48,200
That's why it's extended. So this basically it has salvation.

92
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:56,000
Four words free of avoidable birth of symptoms and to reduce the.

93
00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:07,730
The goal is to reduce the frequent and avoidable burden of morbidity, mortality and disability still to end by means of multisector,

94
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:13,790
collaboration and cooperation at the national, regional and global levels.

95
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:19,100
So we talked about the sum up of the risk factors.

96
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:31,290
It's more difficult, although some modifiable risk factors can be changed controlled by the appropriate.

97
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,790
The strategy is to modify them and including lifestyle change so that.

98
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:46,070
So this after today's course you can think about these first to see, you know,

99
00:14:46,160 --> 00:15:01,430
how those factors can be modified by doing what we were happy to discuss and later to cover some of the important thinking that you would be doing.

100
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:16,280
So what started in this plan basically is the outlined super overarching principles for infectious lung communicable disease control.

101
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:27,000
This includes a life course approach because, as I mentioned, some of the disease risk was not so high.

102
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:37,160
At the current time, it could go back to last generation or early this time exposure.

103
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:44,450
So this life course approach is important and to even when you see life, of course,

104
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:52,130
even the early child foods exposure to some infection could shape a person's

105
00:15:52,730 --> 00:16:00,980
immunity and that could have impacts on the future person's future ability to,

106
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:09,470
you know, fight against infection as well as cancer or human disease.

107
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:18,460
When we discussing the vaccine causes or human diseases, when you track the mechanism of them.

108
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:24,280
This can be linked to hosting immunity.

109
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:34,750
You either lost the immune recognition or the ability to monitoring to identify self from foreign,

110
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:43,690
or that caused all kind of more lung communicable disease and as well as infectious disease.

111
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:54,580
So this life course approach is very important when you get older and then your is the winning immunity that's a you.

112
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:59,690
You had to when you were in your young age?

113
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:12,560
Well, this could impact your sensibility or resistance to the different kinds of infectious diseases and non-communicable diseases.

114
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:21,800
That's why life course approach is critically important to empower men for people and communities,

115
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:32,060
because so many of the interventions that cause some of the risk factors really relate it's community related.

116
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:42,020
For example, if you are in a community which you represent, there's a food deserts where you couldn't have access to health foods,

117
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:49,820
how you can really modify those lifestyle factors, those the risk factors.

118
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:57,110
So that's why you need to have a community oriented approach.

119
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:05,510
Evidence based strategies, understand the mechanism of the disease.

120
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:20,000
It's important for medical management and safety management is one of the focus of the company and seed control.

121
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:36,290
So we need to understand better the evidence for the disease or the mechanisms of disease, the couple for others, and relates to, you know,

122
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:46,860
really public health policy like universal health coverage and the management of real perceived or potential conflicts of interests,

123
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,210
a human rights approach, equity based approach.

124
00:18:52,460 --> 00:19:01,670
These are all important aspects. So this is what's a mutual, the multi-sector approach.

125
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:12,920
National action and the international corporate cooperation and the soon to key and the matters to action.

126
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:17,000
In a way, it's reflected in this different.

127
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:31,050
Principle they are over arching principles. And then different countries could voluntarily sets their goal for.

128
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:45,050
And see the control. This is a one third group of targets, like a 25 relative reduction in the prevalence of race,

129
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:53,060
blood pressure, or compounds of prevalence of risk blood pressure according to national circumstances.

130
00:19:53,690 --> 00:20:00,980
And it's just a different cohort. Rise in diabetes and obesity.

131
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:15,080
This is a pretty much global act currently, and at least 50% of eligible people receive talk therapy and the consider this is a moving target.

132
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:18,950
Some bashing had gone way above this.

133
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:28,150
Some are lots of kids here, but the W.H.O. says at least the hope will work its to this target.

134
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:34,490
But right now it's for low income countries.

135
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:37,640
This goal has not been achieved.

136
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:49,670
This is the mutual goal sets that the countries the countries per mean if they want to put their can where they want to.

137
00:20:49,940 --> 00:21:00,320
There's a resource limitation, of course, and then an 80% ability, and some for affordable basic of technology and essential medicines,

138
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:09,350
including generics required to treat some major non-communicable diseases in both public and private facilities.

139
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:17,540
I think these are good goals, but we haven't reached that point.

140
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:29,440
This is part of the reason why this global action plan have been expand has been extended to 2030.

141
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:38,560
So that's still brand new. So this is some basic situation of NCD and the.

142
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:50,010
But the last slide, what I want to get your tourists to share with you is to get you to start to think,

143
00:21:50,520 --> 00:22:01,170
you know, there is no very clear instinct for infection, infectious disease and chronic disease.

144
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:08,969
When you you know that all communicate there's this impact is smart.

145
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:18,880
I mention I use this most recent example of how infectious disease can impact and seeking in.

146
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:25,770
My type dimensional and affecting my type sectors.

147
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:33,600
So this is a good example of the impacts.

148
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:43,020
The impacts of food and infectious disease can be on long communicable diseases.

149
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:52,230
Actually, is the reporting of food, mainly disease have been impacted.

150
00:22:52,560 --> 00:23:01,470
You see a reduced disease reporting for many diseases, including both infectious disease.

151
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:10,260
So it's really complicated. The Sydney area, COVID 19, has impacts not just among communicable diseases.

152
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:15,240
What's the impact as a reporting surveillance for TB?

153
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:29,100
You see a sharp reduction for TB incidence, which is the one reportable disease for us, for every country, for every W.H.O. member state.

154
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:35,849
But during 2000, 1920, you see a sharp reduction and the way you do surveillance, you say,

155
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:43,730
oh, the incidence is reduced, but you have to think about what's going on in the communities,

156
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:52,590
how that impacts the the reporting disease, the civil and severe of you mentioned the disease surveillance epidemiology.

157
00:23:52,830 --> 00:24:04,070
So we want to understand also into the connection of disease within the human system, with the medical system, with some public health programs.

158
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:16,950
And I'm not going to read too soon or these since in the these slides, but I want you to look at these.

159
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:25,620
We actually I promised you to end early, but maybe this will be a question for you to think about,

160
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:32,310
because I didn't do this infectious disease part of the right.

161
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:35,790
So we refer to the question for future discussion.

162
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:47,880
But I really, based on my overview of the course of what I see here, and we're also share reports and lecture on infectious disease paths,

163
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:58,290
I want you to start saying, why do we need to understand the links between infectious disease and unseen things, non-communicable diseases?

164
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,960
So that's all for today.

165
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:13,330
I'm so sorry for what's wrong with them and to you kind of access to different lenses in my office and to you that I'm doing now.

166
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:19,100
You feel free to call me on. I don't know how I feel.

167
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:25,510
I guess when I came back, I didn't turn up. But anyway, that's all for today.

168
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:33,100
Any questions? Quick questions. You are welcome to stay for a few to ask any questions.

169
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:40,820
I ask you a question just about how exams are structured for this class.

170
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:49,700
Oh, if more AP is actually made through a little better development throughout the exam, save for any.

171
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:55,280
But that's better. What's the best way?

172
00:25:55,490 --> 00:26:04,520
Now? Move into an in-person class and put the exam to exam where not to be accumulates.

173
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:08,000
Usually the first exam would be the first part.

174
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:11,520
And the second exam we're cup of the second part.

175
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:21,929
And then the. If for any very important, essential concept,

176
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:31,680
were missed in the first exam by students that we're part of the review that's a particular

177
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:42,660
person and it may show second but generally that's not very common with the hype.

178
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:53,290
Okay. Yeah, I just wanted to know if it would be structured similar to the vaccine class.

179
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:59,900
Yeah, I saw time sharing the screen. Are you not able to see my screen?

180
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:10,910
I don't think you're sharing right now. Oh, but did you see my squint when I was going through the lung communicable disease?

181
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:15,009
Yes. Okay. Right now I'm not sharing. And you squint.

182
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:22,270
Not because I finished that. Yeah. Yeah, because we're finished.

183
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:25,690
That's a screen and that's a presentation.

184
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:32,770
So I'm not sharing any screen and trying to answer any questions you have for me today.

185
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:41,080
I we will hold that to discuss some question to our open our structure to discuss some later.

186
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:53,170
Okay. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah. Exam typically depends on what format I have in the during the pandemic.

187
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:57,330
I have used that format. That's an open book.

188
00:27:57,930 --> 00:28:03,470
Time restricted exam we made to that course, but still open book.

189
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:14,670
And the exam basically they were helpful. The basic comments and some a C course or basic concepts.

190
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:24,720
Then you were sure to answer multiple choice to all fours and to somewhat open and ask questions.

191
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:29,790
Any other questions?

192
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:52,900
If no other questions for now, I and I think we're into today's session here and then we're prepared for answering your question later.

193
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:56,410
And I hope we were helpful.

194
00:28:57,130 --> 00:29:00,480
I real good. It starts next week when I go back.

195
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:09,400
But in person it was just a very it is disruptive experience the last of what I had.

196
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:18,700
And so that's a horrible incident that impacts what I do today.

197
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:33,340
And I know because of questions for these problems we had, I will send you a recorded lecture on the infectious diseases.

198
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:39,760
Okay. Thank you. And I hope you have a good weekend.

199
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:48,240
Thank you. Yeah. Thank you. I'm looking forward to seeing you next week.
