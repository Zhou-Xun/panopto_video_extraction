1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:06,180
So we'll start doing that now. So let's get started.

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:11,459
And then if you have a piece of paper in front of you, make sure you put your name on it just so I can learn your names.

3
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:17,550
I know you all know everyone, but I don't know you. So if you want to bring it every week, you can to help me out.

4
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:21,180
And if you forget it, it's totally fine. I'm sure we'll get to know each other during the semester.

5
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,800
So let's get started.

6
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:31,499
So what to expect today? Usually I start our classes with this.

7
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,960
What to expect slide. Just to give you a lay of the land of what we're going to cover during the next 2 hours.

8
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:44,370
Going to introduce myself and you're in introduce yourself to me really do a little quick breakout activity.

9
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:48,029
I like to hear what students pass experience with food service.

10
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:52,500
Our food service is a really vast field, right?

11
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:57,210
Especially for dietitians. There's so much that dietitians can do in food service.

12
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:03,030
And it's a really important field. I know a lot of folks in this program love clinical, but I love food service.

13
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:08,370
So hopefully by the end of this semester, I'll be able to convince you that food service could be a good career path for you

14
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:11,669
because there's a lot of different things you can do in food service and in management.

15
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:19,590
We have management and leadership sections in this course to do some class housekeeping, we'll go to the campus page really briefly.

16
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:25,530
We're going to go through the syllabus again briefly, because I know you all can read and you can read through that clearly on your own time.

17
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:29,700
But there's a few key things I want to point out that you'll want to keep in mind for the semester,

18
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:37,620
and then we'll do a quick run through of intro into food service systems and we'll talk about course requirements in a little bit.

19
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:41,459
But this is the textbook, so we lean very closely on this textbook.

20
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:48,360
This will be your friend. A lot of the assignments are based on the textbook because how we run this course

21
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:53,159
is I like to do the readings beforehand and then the assignment is due beforehand,

22
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:58,170
before class. So that way you're prepared to hear it again in lecture, not verbatim, obviously,

23
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:03,120
just so we get that repetition and then we try to do a breakout activity to reinforce concepts.

24
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:07,950
So that's kind of how this class is laid out. But yes, textbook is really important.

25
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:12,120
I know it's the ninth edition is the most up to date. Eighth edition, totally fine.

26
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,830
I have both. They're basically the same. They just update it every few years or so.

27
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,240
So. Let's get started.

28
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:24,040
So, who am I? I'm Patti.

29
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:31,090
I'm an adjunct lecturer here, so I'm not full time faculty, but I am a full time project manager over at the Rogel Cancer Center.

30
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,640
So right down the street, I have a I'm from here, too.

31
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:45,490
So I graduated from you again with my bachelor's in movement science, also with my diet dietetics concentration that might be here at all as well.

32
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:50,259
So I'm kind of U of M through and through. I love Ann Arbor. I'm from Novi.

33
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:53,670
So and I live in Clawson now, so I'm a little bit farther away.

34
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,970
But I love working in Ann Arbor. I love coming back to Ann Arbor. It's just very nostalgic for me.

35
00:02:59,110 --> 00:02:59,980
I also love to learn.

36
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:11,620
So I had a a work experience out at Wayne State and while I was there I started a second masters because I like to keep really busy and why not?

37
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:21,250
So I was pursuing a second masters in communication because I've done work in health communications, particularly in social media dissemination.

38
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:26,440
So newsletters getting the word out about different health communication topics.

39
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:31,900
A lot of my experiences with COVID 19, specifically with people with disabilities, so kind of health behavior,

40
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:36,850
health, education related and you can see how you can segway a little bit in your career, but that's totally okay.

41
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:46,390
But yeah, on that topic of a lot of different work experiences. So if you are wondering different routes, you can go as a dietitian in the future.

42
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:51,940
Definitely ask me questions. I'm willing to help you if you're trying to find a different road for you.

43
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:56,200
I started in clinical, like a lot of people, I was continue and moved up to full time.

44
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:06,030
I worked in ICU, used to use cardiac care, diabetes, oncology and loved it for a while, did some outpatient clinical nutrition.

45
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:13,360
Then I moved into management. So from there I moved into being a foodservice director and I did that for about five ish years.

46
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:18,190
And I've seen a lot of different teams in a lot of different facilities, which was really, really fun.

47
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:23,530
I've worked at really large hospitals. I worked at Providence Health Field.

48
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,379
Then once familiar with that, I started at a really,

49
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:31,660
really small critical access hospital called the Project on the west side of the State is never heard of the logic.

50
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:38,110
No. I feel like every class I get someone but this class, maybe that it's an itty bitty town, it's super, super small.

51
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:43,420
But that's where I started as a food service director. It was a critical access hospital, probably 25 beds.

52
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:51,070
So you could imagine itty bitty. We had a census of five, so it was a really good place to learn about food service and kind of get my feet wet.

53
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:55,720
And I moved on to food service management from there in larger facilities.

54
00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:04,929
Um, mostly in right now my work with the roval, it's a lot of just project management and data management.

55
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:12,790
We run a lot of we are, we oversee the grants that are being issued to physicians here doing research in cancer.

56
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:17,979
So it's very, very cool. I like it a lot and I'm able to lean on management expertise that I got from food service.

57
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:21,790
So the food service again is great because you get management experience which

58
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:27,220
can kind of sprout out to other areas in your in your work life and fun facts.

59
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:32,110
I love to run. I've been running since I was 12, I think 12 or 13.

60
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:37,270
I usually love to run half marathons, but I have a pesky knee injury that I've had for like the past year,

61
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:40,659
and it's super frustrating, but I've kind of been off running for a while.

62
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:45,430
But I love road biking. I love to travel. I try to travel as much as I can.

63
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:48,339
This is my boyfriend, partner and I.

64
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:54,610
Brian We were able to go to the East Orange, which are some awesome islands off the coast of Portugal last August.

65
00:05:54,670 --> 00:06:00,970
I highly recommend really great place. I was able also to do a trip to Greece which is over there.

66
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:08,439
Got to see some ruins, which is awesome. I go with my family who's in that other corner over there?

67
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:11,919
They're very important to me. Obviously grew up very close to them.

68
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:18,010
And every year we go to the U.P. in a little town called Nemo. So we go to it for a week and we just hang out.

69
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:22,540
We hang out on the lake. We go biking, we hike.

70
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:28,100
It's just a lot of fun. And favor been show great British breaking the show that it was like that show.

71
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,990
Yeah I love Noel and Paul and all those people. So lots of fun.

72
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,940
All right. So I like to get kind of a lay of the land, and I think I know the answer to this question.

73
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,080
But raise your hand if you plan to go on to complete your G.I. and become an r d.

74
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:47,900
Usually it's everyone. Maybe see some notes.

75
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:53,440
Okay. All right. Good. And then who has worked in food service before?

76
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:57,400
What does that mean? Virtually full service. Have you worked in food service?

77
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:02,680
So I teach a cooking class that's going to be able to eat.

78
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:06,250
Yeah, that counts. Absolutely. So who's working in food service?

79
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:12,630
She's mostly everyone. That's awesome. Good. So food service is obviously a huge field.

80
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:16,850
It's it's great because it touches every generation.

81
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:21,679
Right. So we see food service as one of the fields where we see every generation in the workplace.

82
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,069
We see really young people working. We see older people working.

83
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:29,270
We see, you know, people in their 20, 3040s, middle age working.

84
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:33,890
But it touches all of us. We got to eat. We all eat at restaurants, usually.

85
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:40,400
And dietitians are needed in specific facilities like hospital, like schools, like long term care facilities.

86
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:48,229
From my experience, we don't always find dietitians in those areas, and that's when it doesn't get dangerous.

87
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:53,830
But they need dietician expertise to make menus to make sure that people are complying with different diets.

88
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,960
So our role is really important in those in those areas.

89
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,530
Okay. That's our new around the room and learn about you.

90
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:06,560
We'll start here and just say your name, say where you're from, and then give a trivia fact about you.

91
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:14,780
You want to go first? Okay. I'll go first. My name is Aria from Michigan.

92
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:20,720
And one trivia fact is I studied abroad in Italy in 19,019.

93
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:24,830
That's awesome. Where were you in Italy? Florence, Italy. That's awesome.

94
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:29,090
Good to meet you. Good morning.

95
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:35,600
My name is Ash McElroy. I'm from this very Milanese Napoli literature.

96
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:40,980
And it could be anything. Could be what you did over breaks.

97
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:45,050
If you have kind of. I have a pet. Yeah, I have a dog.

98
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:50,630
His name is Leo. He's a Pekinese. Very. I think he's a36.

99
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:56,630
I'm sure each other. I was born in Taipei, Taiwan.

100
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:02,390
My mom is Japanese and I have home in Toronto and here.

101
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,170
Thailand. Tokyo. Wow. These are my offices.

102
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:12,830
That's it. That's pretty much it. Great. You want to go next?

103
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:17,090
Good morning, everyone. Irene from Shanghai.

104
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:27,830
I just love strong training and personal trainer and I want to perhaps go on with any competition after graduation.

105
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:31,970
And I'm Jordan Diller.

106
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:38,930
I'm from Westchester, New York. I truly benefit from club gymnastics.

107
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:53,870
And Alison, I'm from Columbus, Ohio. And then I went to California and drove Route one with my boyfriend for break, so it was beautiful.

108
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:06,440
Um, I'm Karen. I'm from Spokane, Washington, and I competitively cross-country skiing for 15 years.

109
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:12,550
Oh, that's a hard sport. Yeah, she was very new to me.

110
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:17,930
I'm from Ann Arbor. And fun fact is, I really like art photography.

111
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:22,010
And I used to teach those wine and painting classes back a long time ago.

112
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:25,790
And so I'm trying to get back into painting again. Those are fun.

113
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:30,140
They're fun to do. Yeah. Then you have your art that you have to keep up forever.

114
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:38,510
And it was actually me just going around and helping, like, basically painting everyone for them at one point because everyone gets pretty heavy wine.

115
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:48,469
Hi, I'm Taylor and also from Ann Arbor. And I have two dogs.

116
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:54,650
They're both puppies. One is five months, so she's pretty lucky to have this.

117
00:10:56,060 --> 00:11:08,959
I'm Maya. I'm also from inner city, and I bring birth good friends who I'm so grateful for.

118
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:12,560
They are here. I play more at home.

119
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:16,380
How many things?

120
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:24,440
I mean, I'm from Myanmar and I love to visit the picture.

121
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:28,890
What's your favorite thing to bake at time? What is it? I'll talk later.

122
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:34,820
Yeah, I think time everyone I've heard city in Farmington Hills, Michigan.

123
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:40,990
So I think I know and I lived in New York for ten years and I was like professional dancing.

124
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:45,140
And so what kind of dance? Modern dance, based off of the style, really?

125
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:50,090
Colors was one of the pioneers of modern dance. Okay. So fabric and pretty lighting.

126
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:58,310
And I'm not. Hi. I'm from Fort Collins, Colorado.

127
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:06,600
Um, sort of a place for me to answer. And then I am a crazy place lady.

128
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:17,940
I used when I took over and I had 80. Why are they all over your home in one room when we have 16?

129
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:21,330
I had to downsize when I was 12. That's amazing.

130
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:26,580
So I am also a plant person. And my boyfriend and I, we he's a fish guy.

131
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:31,200
So he has this huge aquarium and we have a plant growing out of the fish tank.

132
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,200
And it is like sending vines across the road.

133
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:39,209
And it's the most wonderful thing ever. It's what I love it so much.

134
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:45,150
Yeah, it's awesome. And the roots get nutrients from the fish tank, so it's like, you know, the circle of life and it's super cool.

135
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:55,890
And. Jaelin I'm from Grand Rapids, Michigan, and I have a car into Walnut, so that's two things I need to keep him.

136
00:12:56,490 --> 00:13:03,780
He doesn't look like that. Okay, so I'm Alison.

137
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:13,020
I'm from Southwest Virginia and I have a dog who's over the next few months and and all.

138
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:18,390
But so is he older.

139
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:23,250
She she's nine months. I use a rest three months.

140
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:29,310
So we've got a long way to go home. So we might need some training.

141
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:37,700
Yeah, those dogs are wonderful. We have a 12, 12 year old pappy on and he's not been a good boy this week.

142
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:44,400
Yeah, sometimes they're not nice, husky and some of the most southern water ever.

143
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:54,360
I'm Jackie. I'm from Lake Placid, Florida, and I like learning different languages if I ever have free time.

144
00:13:54,930 --> 00:14:00,110
How many languages do you know? Yes.

145
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:03,290
And I really want learn. That's awesome.

146
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:07,129
Languages are hard. Yeah. That's awesome. Yeah.

147
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:12,760
I'm driving from Windsor, Ontario, in Canada and over break I go back into, like the.

148
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:18,799
So early with you guys like distress. So. Yeah.

149
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,310
Those are really nice. Oh, good grief. Good to meet all of you.

150
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:29,850
I like getting the trivia. Thanks. I can try to remember your name. So if I ask you your name a few times.

151
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:34,490
Don't take it personally. There are a lot of y'all, so just be patient with me.

152
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:41,240
But thank you. It's great to learn a little bit about you, everyone. Okay, so we're going to do quick breakout activity now.

153
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:49,220
I'm going to count off everyone and if people to level three. 18.

154
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,490
We will probably do four groups, so we'll count off.

155
00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:00,530
We use a Google drive for some of the breakout activities in class.

156
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:08,330
And if you ever don't, I think most people have a computer here, but if you don't, it's okay because I make this so you can,

157
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:12,800
you know, I'll have questions up on the board, too, so you can always write out your answer to so however you're comfortable.

158
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:14,840
But if you have the slides up,

159
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:22,400
you can click on the link to get to the Google Drive or you can just put the the li URL in your browser and it should come up.

160
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:28,729
So we're able to pull that up. Okay. And you could see I've loaded in a few weeks already where I know we're going to have breakout activity.

161
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:32,240
So go on a week, one intro and then once I assign you to a group,

162
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:38,150
you're going to go into your groups document and all these questions are are in there so can take 15,

163
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:43,550
20 minutes with your group, discuss the questions and answer them and then we're going to talk about them in a little bit.

164
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:49,070
So you're going to talk about what association associations you have with the word food service.

165
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:54,139
So we all have different experience with food service. We all have a lot of preconceived notions of food service.

166
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:58,970
I know I did before I went into the field and even when I was sitting in your seat right here.

167
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:03,230
But it changed over time. So I'm curious to see what you think about it.

168
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:07,190
I want to know what your past experience in food services were.

169
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:10,489
So where was it? Did you like it? There's a heat.

170
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:16,910
It was good about it. What was bad? And then number three, what type of supports you need for me to be successful?

171
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:22,520
So think about what's gone well and classes that you've taken before, what has not gone well.

172
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:28,239
What do you like to see from an instructor? What's inhibited your success in the past?

173
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,540
Of course. So those kind of things are helpful for me to know too. And then what do you hope to learn?

174
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:38,239
So this course is really important if you're going on to take the dietetic registration exam.

175
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,180
There's a lot of content from this class that shows up there.

176
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:48,230
And actually before each lecture, I have objectives from the actual exam that you're going to take.

177
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:51,890
So later when you're studying, you can go back to those PowerPoint slides and you could say,

178
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:56,600
okay, we talked about food costs in this lecture and I'm studying for the D exam.

179
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:05,930
I can go back there and get that content, but I want to know what you want to learn that could be helpful for you to know in the future.

180
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:11,330
So let's let's do groups of four.

181
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:15,380
So I count off one, two, three.

182
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:20,180
Four, four. One, two, three, four.

183
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:24,570
One, two, four. One, two, three, four.

184
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:31,790
One, two. Okay, great. Now we're going to do like, one, two, three for each of the corners.

185
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:39,010
Do that. What was it? So one, two in the back and three in the back, and then four up here.

186
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:46,490
Everything I do is really take everything you can do whatever you want.

187
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:50,479
Yeah, you could. Yeah, you could take your things.

188
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:59,790
You could leave them to bring them in.

189
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:06,320
You. And then we'll reconvene around 835 ish.

190
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:44,150
Oh, go ahead. Yeah, I think it's really important for think there's a lot of reasons why we have three three in the restaurant.

191
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:51,430
Yeah, I just have to leave it in.

192
00:18:54,440 --> 00:19:22,850
Okay. Unfortunately, we can if they think they're getting too much directed at the latter's relationship with the third party system on average.

193
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:30,850
I may reflect on what goes through your mind. Well, you know, I don't know.

194
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:36,210
So I truly so close our eyes on the.

195
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:53,000
So trying to say that there has been an episode of growth that we should be part of.

196
00:19:54,440 --> 00:20:08,800
Yeah. We want to say I don't know why people are so worried about like different like education levels or missing from different set of youth,

197
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:22,430
our September 15,000 or even after, I think all of them you know,

198
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:32,900
I didn't even think we are pleased with it, but I'm going to have to give that to them.

199
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:40,650
Yeah, I know.

200
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:47,050
And you know what?

201
00:20:50,330 --> 00:21:01,670
I can talk to people like when they were younger guys.

202
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:16,950
What they're doing now is it every time they want to have happen because that's what are.

203
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:29,569
I mean I don't know. It's it's you know,

204
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:36,320
most of what we mentioned in the first one is true except for the intimidating that they're they're they're very

205
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:51,400
primary business because they're like when everything they recommend something they working with with the.

206
00:21:55,250 --> 00:22:02,820
Or, you know, like just like the creative spirit.

207
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:15,170
It was just like, no, it is not available for that pain and all that.

208
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:43,760
And I was like, Oh, I love I think that it was really important for us to do that.

209
00:22:43,760 --> 00:23:04,309
But after that, I really feel like we're having difficulty,

210
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:15,760
that anyone can help it in the history of the science but doesn't really know

211
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:26,120
what really is that global warming was a big thing that was about to recover.

212
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:31,579
Who is going to be enough to what?

213
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:41,610
It was a very different way of getting there and it was like, who work on Lake Erie?

214
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:56,899
The court is like from what I've heard of that school, it was so different.

215
00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:02,900
So that was the in the actual restaurant that we are.

216
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:06,950
So anybody else that we know what they're now.

217
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:18,350
Yeah. Yeah. And also, you know, people who are really blessed and I was just thinking, I thought that was so cool.

218
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:25,610
Yeah. I was like, I mean, that I felt like I was married.

219
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:41,860
Yeah. Yeah. I don't I don't think anybody would really be single or, you know, like I haven't been about those, but I was think about people like,

220
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:52,069
you know, because I could do whatever I had to do or like I heard an ambulance anyway, I did not because I drove home.

221
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:56,840
Everything is impacting the growth in the economy.

222
00:24:57,230 --> 00:25:04,969
So like and I was so sick and although like we got to the point where I would do more because

223
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:12,950
I was like so much like I had to be patient and I was in the house and everything else,

224
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:18,830
so, so I didn't care.

225
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:33,140
And in fact, I wanted to appreciate and I'm going to talk about it.

226
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:45,860
Yeah. And I mentioned some of the so important like I never liked the way that we have to do.

227
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:58,730
You have to know that you know someone like really or what had happened to them.

228
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:09,440
Oh yeah. They, you know, she doesn't have to get up early now because it's so much easier to work with so much greater value,

229
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:19,249
like good age, working on making sure you don't have it at night and you know, we're colleagues.

230
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:28,330
Do you know anything about that? But said, I don't know when you're able to say yes.

231
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:30,840
So yeah, I mean, yeah,

232
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:44,450
I don't know what it's like luxury recording because I think that it's like we're going to have to assemble and make sure everything was like,

233
00:26:44,810 --> 00:27:00,190
Yeah, I mean, I would start out. They're really not very good.

234
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:00,790
And also.

235
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:28,730
It's meant to be more and more your concerns about what we're doing in that business, but what is something that's going to really help ultimately?

236
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:42,680
So that when I was in my life, someone I was in high school, I wanted my man.

237
00:27:46,040 --> 00:28:29,700
I have so many other notes that the same area over the years when know that we are doing all right here we go again.

238
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:39,080
And I'll show you exactly the right way.

239
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:57,040
Yeah, I knew that. I would just say, especially because it is like the imagery and I really got to get married.

240
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:01,819
So I don't really how it is. I read the recordings that I gave her,

241
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:15,990
but I got more that you I like when she was like a lot of times I realized that about for the store as far as we can we can talk about

242
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:37,969
okay I think there's anything you need to become very clear and then you're working through them as I was watching all of that.

243
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:52,730
Yeah. And I was like, Oh yeah, I think I thought that was a great letter.

244
00:29:53,360 --> 00:30:18,620
And I got to get more and more people to read and write and is true that I feel like it's like this record translated one year or so.

245
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:54,140
It's think it's a lot of things that really that is very helpful in the future and I don't think it was the right way or the beginning of that.

246
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:02,870
And then for me I want to citation.

247
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:08,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

248
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:16,360
You know, I don't know yeah I don't know how to work with every has a goal.

249
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:19,430
We can't avoid things like that.

250
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:22,490
Yeah.

251
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:43,500
And it's very healthy and I would just agree that yeah I think that you have to like full time or contract because I don't know if you want to use.

252
00:31:44,150 --> 00:32:00,100
Well yeah I know I was not the first one could have ever had to start for example, you know when I was little as early as I really I used to think.

253
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:33,180
I don't think you're really worried about like. Here is this thing I'm thinking, like, how did you end up in the operating room?

254
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:40,230
I mean, I started working with guys, and that's what we want to learn.

255
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:55,500
When I when I was like, Oh, yeah, that is what I was going to ask everyone.

256
00:32:55,500 --> 00:33:17,580
Yeah, I'm surprised that, you know, something like it's ironic that it wasn't because I was really young, so I don't know.

257
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:23,520
I think they're really ready to wrap up what I would do.

258
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:30,330
Put your final thoughts down here.

259
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:37,410
Excuse me. Yeah.

260
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:48,930
All right. So we're going to go around the room and there might be some repeat comments.

261
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:57,540
That's totally okay. But we'll start with a group one. And so what associates and associations do you have with the word service?

262
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:15,180
But you're going to come up with as a result of paying for food and cooking food, caring for like food safety and serving food and food preparation.

263
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:20,580
Okay. Definitely need your here that you definitely need non-slip shoes too.

264
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:23,880
I have definitely slipped a few dollars, so.

265
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:27,480
Yeah. Good. Then what about number two?

266
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:31,040
What was question number two? Career experiences.

267
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:42,540
Experiences. So we have working at a café or our hospital room service food gatherers, Zingerman's Food Pantry and Taco Bell.

268
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:51,490
Okay. Awesome. I love Taco Bell. And then what did your group members think of those experiences?

269
00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:56,979
Really good experiences. Were they not good? Yeah, I think overall they're great experiences.

270
00:34:56,980 --> 00:35:03,620
I mean, there's like a service. A lot of times though that can be difficult, but then again, like we were working with.

271
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:07,150
But I think overall. Good. Okay. Good.

272
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:14,590
Yeah, definitely. You're dealing with people all the time, you know, and then you remember your question.

273
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:21,930
What support do you need to be successful? 37 and having office hours and having assignments and due dates from the start.

274
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:29,260
We can plan out every semester the lectures being recorded at home and then just

275
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:33,280
being engaging and having activities like this because it is such an early class,

276
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:36,969
it's really early and we'll talk about that when we go over the syllabus.

277
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:42,879
But just to comment on that, I do have dates for everything, so not to fear, I have rubrics for everything.

278
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:48,760
So also not to fear. Forget what else you said, but we do try to make it engaging.

279
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:53,680
Sometimes it's hard. There is lecture content that we have to go over, unfortunately, but I will do my best.

280
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:58,180
So thanks. And then what do you hope to learn?

281
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:05,890
So the different areas of food service and how dietitians play a role and then

282
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:12,010
that different job opportunities within the food service industry for dietitians.

283
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:16,450
And then also how to prepare for the credential exam. Okay, perfect.

284
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:21,700
Yeah, I can sometimes be unclear or dietitians have a role in food service, but they certainly do.

285
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:24,970
And we'll cover that. All right. Great. Thank you.

286
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:37,870
Group to. Question When we have food safety, the outstanding cooking sports, a sports performance filling station and bakery.

287
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:43,870
Okay. It's a fueling station, I.

288
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:57,010
Oh, good. Food service words. And then what were your group's experiences with food service and our assessment that are

289
00:36:57,970 --> 00:37:07,390
making your prescriptions work that we need to do in order to be creative in school?

290
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:20,410
And then I looked in the many cases and the dietary laser systems for the catering company and of that hospital as a nutritionist.

291
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:32,880
So for dinner and that's better than the mess you enjoy at a cafe on campus, a prep cook at the kitchen campus and Natalie's steakhouse.

292
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:36,460
The lot. Yeah, that's good. Okay, cool.

293
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:40,060
And then what did folks think about working in food service?

294
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:46,330
I felt it was quite interesting. I got me interested in food information.

295
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:53,530
People, since I've been trying to do everything they can seem to be more at the register,

296
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:59,080
answering, interviewing customers about questions they had on products some.

297
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:04,000
So I think they're ordering after restocking, answering three really questions,

298
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:11,560
putting orders, getting people starting to resources deliveries where snacks.

299
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:22,350
Making the food. Bringing customers. So who's going to help us?

300
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:39,149
And then what type of support do you need? And then we then did surprise assignments ensure that those items are accessible and fast and making

301
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:45,060
them if not making them available at the beginning of classes and planned out first semester and.

302
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:53,450
Having all the teams in the savings in detail on the syllabus class is organized.

303
00:38:53,840 --> 00:39:00,830
As I was rambling out explained, deadlines are consistent recordings of lectures.

304
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:05,300
Nothing happens to set schedule breaks.

305
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:10,040
It sounds like the script likes consistency and want to know what to expect.

306
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:14,360
Right. That's totally fair. Yeah. Yeah.

307
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:21,230
I think we'll cover all those things. I tend not to have surprise assignments because then it's I mean, it's a pain for you and me.

308
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:26,300
So, you know, I don't think we'll have any of those other deadlines in there.

309
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:30,709
I think in canvas, students are able to see the whole outline of assignments.

310
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:38,420
I know one semester I didn't find out that students couldn't see the assignment tab until like the last month of class.

311
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:42,000
And I felt horrible, but no one told me so. We'll go over this in the syllabus too.

312
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:48,589
If there's ever anything that you need or like you can't view something on canvas, I try to go through everything in the student view,

313
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:52,790
but there's a lot of content and I skip things sometimes, so you just oversee it.

314
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:56,660
So definitely let me know. You could tell me a class, you could email me.

315
00:39:57,230 --> 00:40:00,230
I want to be able to help you. So awesome.

316
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:12,140
And then what do you hope to learn and learn about career opportunities and responsibilities in terms of others, how to be a leader in management?

317
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,980
And then what careers is this for art?

318
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:25,550
These include management and and changing our mindsets on food services outside of just the stereotypical period setting.

319
00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:34,830
And then. Which preparation for or knowledge for being anticipated.

320
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:38,060
Okay, perfect. You know, we want to debunk the lunch lady myth, right?

321
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:41,840
Because I know that's what I thought foodservice service was when I was a student.

322
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:47,570
And I think that's because when we see professionals in food service, you're usually serving food, right?

323
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:54,860
Even dietitians, even managers. We all kind of step up to the plate and we help out with stocking or serving meals.

324
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:59,479
But there's a lot of background things that those people do, too, that we don't always see.

325
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:02,990
And those roles are really important, too. All right. Great. Thanks.

326
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:06,200
Group two. Group three. Okay.

327
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:13,940
What were your associations with food service, your work, since we have been connected to the commission,

328
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:25,280
say production application experience and cultural customer service.

329
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:31,309
Awesome. I got a few of them.

330
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:41,270
Okay, awesome. Good. And then past experiences deserve credit for what we have.

331
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:55,230
There's a sprouting chefs and kids course and healing family cooking classes with the people at the hospital.

332
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:59,110
Food service, the dining hall food bank.

333
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:12,780
Um, yeah. And then the experiences on there can be frustrating, but also rewarding.

334
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:20,090
And with the cooking classes, well, kids chatting.

335
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:36,060
And in terms of other prep time and time consuming, giving ingredients and making sure dietary preferences are met,

336
00:42:37,350 --> 00:42:42,600
but also building relationships with people as important and effective.

337
00:42:42,610 --> 00:42:51,450
And so it's service work. And number three, support.

338
00:42:51,450 --> 00:42:57,689
We said easy to follow cameras, of course, always a clear set of debates, study groups,

339
00:42:57,690 --> 00:43:05,700
office hours and then like incorporating knowledge everything from other classes into here.

340
00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:15,409
Oh, great. Only being waited until the exams and then all assignments.

341
00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:21,530
All being assigned during the last few weeks. Got it.

342
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:33,140
And then what we hope to learn in the course, how to be successful in food service, which could include also legal entities.

343
00:43:34,190 --> 00:43:37,430
You know how a seven, seven, five facility kitchen,

344
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:47,630
I think how to maintain a clean and safe food service environment and the best way to manage inventory to your experience.

345
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:52,250
So not the whole class in your discussion here, though. Good job.

346
00:43:53,570 --> 00:43:57,410
But yes, something that kind of spoke to me. Foodservice can definitely be frustrating.

347
00:43:57,410 --> 00:44:02,330
I'm sure a lot of you have experienced that, too. And a lot of that is because it's just there's high turnover.

348
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:07,910
Sometimes some places there aren't. You know, folks call off for a variety of reasons.

349
00:44:08,090 --> 00:44:13,430
A lot of different types of people work in a food service, right? All different education backgrounds, all different walks of life.

350
00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:17,330
So it can be really hard, but it is really, really rewarding.

351
00:44:17,450 --> 00:44:23,089
Sometimes the hours are long, but it can be a lot of fun too, especially when you have a really, really good team.

352
00:44:23,090 --> 00:44:26,330
And maybe some of you have experienced that too. So awesome. Great.

353
00:44:26,990 --> 00:44:30,510
Thank you. And then my group. Yeah, we have a lot of words.

354
00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:43,910
We said restaurant, customer service, low pay, food safety, long hours, weekend work and physical work,

355
00:44:45,290 --> 00:44:53,180
intimidating managers, diverse workforce, low profit margin and food waste.

356
00:44:53,480 --> 00:45:01,160
Okay, that's a good list. I don't know of any managers.

357
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:05,990
I've had a few of those, too, so I feel that. All right.

358
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:09,860
What about. Yeah, number two. Past experiences? Yeah.

359
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:11,390
This group has a few.

360
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:21,590
We have a Starbucks barista working in a restaurant, working in a bakery and cafe wedding cake studio, working in market dining hall.

361
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:30,520
And then for Starbucks, we were working with other business or business students, I think it was in the rice school.

362
00:45:30,530 --> 00:45:34,280
There's a lot of physical work. Severe, lower back pain.

363
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:38,210
Standing all the time for the restaurant.

364
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:42,740
The word sticky for a mom and pop restaurant.

365
00:45:42,770 --> 00:45:49,159
Worked as a hostess, but also did food running or filling in where needed for the bakery and cafe.

366
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:56,180
Early hours. That's cool work being around a lot of sugar. Lack of sleep for the wedding cake studio.

367
00:45:56,180 --> 00:46:01,399
Very chill, good hours, higher stress for transporting wedding cakes and then for the market.

368
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:06,500
Worked as a cashier, flexible and people are very nice but long hours standing.

369
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:11,380
And that was good. Yeah. Yeah. Who did wedding cakes? I did.

370
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:14,820
Did you. Did you two hurt them? We did everything. Yeah, we did.

371
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:18,660
Yeah. It was like a gluten free wedding cake studio in Brooklyn, New York.

372
00:46:18,670 --> 00:46:22,870
And it was really cool. It was like just a short time I did for, like, maybe like four months.

373
00:46:23,350 --> 00:46:26,620
Yeah. And we do, like, dessert bars also. Yeah.

374
00:46:27,130 --> 00:46:34,330
Cool. Good. And then support that you would need similar to, like, what everybody else said.

375
00:46:34,330 --> 00:46:38,860
Clear canvas page, no due dates. The earlier the better one.

376
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:42,370
Finding our deadlines, reviewing sections.

377
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:49,240
Clear rubrics for inhibiting success was just unclear of communication and then just

378
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:54,220
the coursework not being related to like the readings and other supplemental material.

379
00:46:55,860 --> 00:47:08,280
And then for what we learn or what we hope to learn. Food Safety Kitchen Set up how foodservice relates to being an R.D. can vary.

380
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:12,870
Oh Can an R.D. and food service be full time or contract based?

381
00:47:13,050 --> 00:47:15,660
I'm sure it's both, but learning about that,

382
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:24,550
and then we talked about fast food establishments and we were also brought up like there's a registered dietitian at like some like a Wendy's,

383
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:30,360
like what do they do? Kind of things like that and learning about non-clinical R.D. Jobs.

384
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:35,579
So yeah, there are definitely lots of fast food. R.D. Yeah, but again, they can kind of be a mystery.

385
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:38,670
Like what do they do? What takes up their day?

386
00:47:38,670 --> 00:47:44,580
But a lot of them, like they do a lot of labeling too, and a lot of nutri like database work.

387
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:49,169
So if you like data and you like working with numbers and you know,

388
00:47:49,170 --> 00:47:54,150
because every nutrient that's on the food label for that restaurant has a number related to it, obviously.

389
00:47:55,020 --> 00:48:00,569
So kind of like that in dietitian, the food service can be mostly full time.

390
00:48:00,570 --> 00:48:06,190
I'm sure there's all array of, you know, roles of full time, part time contract.

391
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:13,500
There's contract companies. So sometimes companies will contract out food service staffed staff, which we'll talk about in a little bit.

392
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:21,830
It's probably for budget reasons. I can't I don't really know why beyond that, why they would do that, but.

393
00:48:21,870 --> 00:48:25,380
Yeah, good. All right. Well, thanks, everyone.

394
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:28,710
You can go back to your seats now. Yeah.

395
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:36,200
Here, stay with me while I think of it.

396
00:48:39,090 --> 00:48:44,100
So next what we're going to do, we're going to have a quick five minute break after we go through this section.

397
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:51,420
So next, we're going to go through the syllabus and then we're going to go through the canvas page a little bit, too.

398
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:58,170
And then we'll break we'll break for 5 minutes because I know this is the one class and we try to break every class.

399
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:03,420
I try to do it on the hour. Sometimes we go a little over. So I want to kind of stretch the legs of it.

400
00:49:05,910 --> 00:49:12,870
All right. So just a little bit of housekeeping. So we I talked about this, but all classes are recorded through Panopto.

401
00:49:12,870 --> 00:49:17,160
They're on the canvas page. So you can go back and listen to them as many times as you want.

402
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:25,140
For some, they're all there for your listening pleasure. This one's obvious, but don't please don't share or post any lecture videos anywhere.

403
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:31,260
This is property of the course. Everyone pays a lot of money to take this course, so please keep it within the course itself.

404
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:38,000
And then I stop frequently to ask questions and comments during our class sessions and then area so this

405
00:49:38,010 --> 00:49:43,260
but we'll have a break such a late go to the bathroom you're welcome to eat bring snacks if you want.

406
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:46,979
I know it's early. Maybe you have not had breakfast. I'm not an early breakfast eater.

407
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:50,970
So filtering to bring things that you need in this class.

408
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:57,880
So let's go through the syllabus.

409
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:06,660
So this is on the main page of the canvas site right here.

410
00:50:06,810 --> 00:50:10,770
I try really hard not to change the syllabus because again, it's a pain for you.

411
00:50:10,770 --> 00:50:15,839
It's also a pain for me. So if I do have to update it, I'll make it very clear.

412
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:23,460
I give a lot of canvas announcements, so I'll say it in class, I'll say it in canvas, but you can usually find the syllabus right here.

413
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:27,150
We also have a course summary. Right here.

414
00:50:27,330 --> 00:50:30,960
Do other courses do this? This is the first time I've laid out a syllabus like this.

415
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:38,849
I like to try different things every time I teach, so if we don't like this, I might get rid of it for the next course.

416
00:50:38,850 --> 00:50:46,830
But everything is listed right here too. So our class sessions are here, even our virtual office, our sessions are here, every assignment is here.

417
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:54,350
So that's all laid out really nicely, but it is also in the syllabus. So a few ways where you can find it and.

418
00:50:55,790 --> 00:51:02,090
So I'm Patty. This is my email. If you have any questions ever, this is the route that you should take.

419
00:51:03,890 --> 00:51:11,930
I was there meeting time, so I know this is a really early class and I believe we have about 30 people enrolled and we have 18 today.

420
00:51:12,230 --> 00:51:19,520
While we don't take attendance here because we're all adults and we're all in grad school and it's very mundane to do that.

421
00:51:20,090 --> 00:51:23,420
It really is to your best interest to come to class if you're a little bit late.

422
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:27,980
Totally fine. I get it. People are catching busses. You might be driving, you might be walking.

423
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:30,590
It's the weather. It's cold, it's nasty out. I totally get it.

424
00:51:30,770 --> 00:51:36,860
So if you mentally understand but you're only going to get out of this class the most if you come.

425
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:43,000
I think I was mentioned to someone before we came last semester. I taught and I talked to like eight people every morning.

426
00:51:43,010 --> 00:51:46,250
So, you know, if that's the case this year, I totally get it.

427
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:52,770
I don't know if this group went through the remote zoom. A session where you were all remote.

428
00:51:52,890 --> 00:51:56,900
Yeah, I can remember if that was like a few cohorts ago.

429
00:51:57,830 --> 00:52:03,410
But it is in your best interest to be here. We do things in class that can't be replicated outside of class.

430
00:52:04,130 --> 00:52:11,060
Yes, all the assignments are based on the readings, so they're kind of just to reinforce what you are reading each week.

431
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:17,180
But we need to have the class time to have things come to life and obviously to answer your questions that you might have.

432
00:52:17,390 --> 00:52:22,640
So really important to be here. That's my soapbox office hours.

433
00:52:23,150 --> 00:52:30,890
We do just virtual office hours, Mondays 4 to 5. Is there any class classes at that time or is that an open hour for everyone?

434
00:52:31,250 --> 00:52:36,710
It's good. Yeah. Okay, good. Just wanted to make sure if you ever want to meet in person, we can definitely do that.

435
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:42,110
But email me to set up a date and time where you can talk to me after class and I'm more than happy to do that as well.

436
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:49,610
The link for the virtual office hours are right here and it can also be found in the schedule too.

437
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:54,560
So every Monday 4 to 5, you can ask me questions about homework.

438
00:52:55,670 --> 00:53:01,490
You can just say hi if you want to talk about food service related things, things that are really the food service dietitians.

439
00:53:01,790 --> 00:53:05,160
I'm here to here to help. Description.

440
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:08,330
We won't go over that. I know you all can read that.

441
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:14,580
We have our course goals and of course competencies that we'll be referring to throughout the course.

442
00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:23,750
Okay. So this section course requirements each week we have class and we have readings and we have assignments.

443
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:33,080
So I mentioned before supposed to come to class having completed the readings, having completed the assignment that's due at 1159 Wednesday.

444
00:53:33,530 --> 00:53:38,599
And the point of that is that you come to the class and you already have an idea of what's going to happen,

445
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:42,770
but we reinforce it with a little bit more content and a few more group activities.

446
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:50,900
So. That's a total just of the class, but we have a few sections, so the first section is our servicing section.

447
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:54,950
So the next three weeks, so two, three and four,

448
00:53:55,100 --> 00:54:01,489
we're going to be covering search of content and that's going to be 30% of your total grade in this course assignment.

449
00:54:01,490 --> 00:54:05,750
So after the search save section, we go into content in the book.

450
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:12,860
So like regular textbook and there's six assignments related to content in there and that's 40% of your grade.

451
00:54:13,190 --> 00:54:17,809
And then the capstone project for this course is a free service case study.

452
00:54:17,810 --> 00:54:23,930
It's a group project. It has two parts, it has a written group report and it has a group presentation.

453
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:29,450
And those we talk about a little bit more into the course I'd like to get of save out of the way.

454
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:33,590
So we'll be discussing the requirements for this food service case study.

455
00:54:33,590 --> 00:54:37,550
I want to say it's February 9th, so it's early February.

456
00:54:37,850 --> 00:54:43,730
Don't worry about it right now. We're just going to worry about Thursday of right now, but early in February will assign groups.

457
00:54:43,970 --> 00:54:49,070
They'll be assigned a food service establishment in Ann Arbor or in the University of Michigan area.

458
00:54:49,070 --> 00:54:54,590
And you'll be working with a contact there to kind of get an idea of what they do and how they operate at that establishment.

459
00:54:55,220 --> 00:54:58,370
But more on that later. So that is the makeup of the course.

460
00:54:58,370 --> 00:55:01,969
So staff save assignments and their final product.

461
00:55:01,970 --> 00:55:06,020
There is no final exam in here. The only exam is the Surf Save exam,

462
00:55:06,290 --> 00:55:11,690
which we'll go over in a little bit and that's going to be online that you get to schedule on your own time, which is great.

463
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:16,730
Any questions on that or any questions about anything I've talked about so far?

464
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:30,389
No. Okay. Of course materials so the surfacing of manager course with online proctor exam.

465
00:55:30,390 --> 00:55:33,510
So I sent an email out around Black Friday time.

466
00:55:33,510 --> 00:55:37,920
Was anyone able to use the codes? Yeah. If money is good.

467
00:55:38,910 --> 00:55:46,290
Has anyone has everyone gotten their surf save modules purchased it that who is taking sort save.

468
00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:49,860
Yes. Okay, good. Because you will need that starting this week.

469
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:54,480
So if you have it, make sure you purchase that. This is where you go.

470
00:55:55,420 --> 00:55:59,410
To get it. So I think so.

471
00:55:59,510 --> 00:56:03,220
So seriously, the manager products.

472
00:56:04,270 --> 00:56:11,680
Manage your online training. And you should have gotten this one, this $179 course.

473
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:17,020
I mentioned in the announcement in some emails that the nutritional sciences department

474
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:22,350
gave everyone $100 for that and their student count just to offset that cost.

475
00:56:22,390 --> 00:56:31,210
They know it's a lot of money. We used to bring in someone to teach this content, but when I was teaching during the pandemic, like early COVID,

476
00:56:31,510 --> 00:56:39,850
we went all remote and this method of the online modules and the online exam actually like students, liked it better than doing it in person.

477
00:56:40,030 --> 00:56:45,730
So the way this works is that you will complete servicing modules before class.

478
00:56:46,030 --> 00:56:48,100
There's a service save assignment that you'll complete.

479
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:55,010
So the modules are kind of like your readings and then sorts of assignment and then in class will reinforce the concept.

480
00:56:55,040 --> 00:57:00,580
Sometimes students have questions after reviewing the modules and then we'll do some group discussions about it.

481
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:04,810
So that's how the service section is going to. It's going to work a little bit differently.

482
00:57:07,330 --> 00:57:14,500
You do have to schedule your online exam through Proctor you so you're going to do that as

483
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:18,340
a part of your assignment for next week because you have to go in and schedule your exam.

484
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:22,479
I have instructions on canvas on how to do that because the survey website is a little bit clunky.

485
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:29,710
It's not my favorite, but if anyone has issues with scheduling their exam, just shoot me an email and I can walk you through on how to do that.

486
00:57:30,010 --> 00:57:34,210
But you're essentially be scheduling to take that exam during.

487
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:42,530
Where is it the week of January 26 through Wednesday, February 1st?

488
00:57:45,290 --> 00:57:50,080
I'm jumping ahead a little bit, but that's okay. Gregoire textbook.

489
00:57:50,090 --> 00:57:55,280
Everyone get it? Okay. Yeah, okay. Ninth edition is kind of expensive.

490
00:57:55,280 --> 00:58:02,120
So you get the eighth edition until they get two. And then we do have some additional reading, some articles on canvas.

491
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:07,650
Or this week you had the the Hermann article and then the the food service dietitian article.

492
00:58:07,970 --> 00:58:13,670
I tried to be respectful of how many articles I signed because we do lean heavily on the book.

493
00:58:13,670 --> 00:58:21,499
It's a great book. It's actually written by a on and a Ph.D. dietician who has worked in food service and researches food service.

494
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:27,079
So I really like this book a lot and I try to strategically assign articles.

495
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:31,820
So you're not just reading just to read. So there aren't that many articles in this class.

496
00:58:32,060 --> 00:58:38,660
But when you do, I've picked it because I think it's a really important article and there's important concepts for you to for you to learn.

497
00:58:41,530 --> 00:58:49,100
Course communication. So again, email best way. Please let me have 24 to 48 hours to respond.

498
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:58,159
I work full time and sometimes my workflow can and can be up and down just like everyone else's life.

499
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:04,639
So give me two days to respond and then if you email on the weekends, I'll respond definitely by Monday.

500
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:07,850
Sometimes I am on email on the weekends, but you're not guaranteed a response.

501
00:59:08,060 --> 00:59:13,790
So I try to stay away as email as much as possible as I can on the weekends, virtual office hours.

502
00:59:13,790 --> 00:59:19,040
So again, zoom Mondays from 4 to 5 and those will start next Monday.

503
00:59:21,460 --> 00:59:26,160
I'm big on campus announcements, so everyone should have these turned on by this point.

504
00:59:26,170 --> 00:59:28,130
But I have had some students in the past who have not.

505
00:59:28,150 --> 00:59:34,480
So these are just instructions on how to make sure those canvas announcements are on because I send updates every week,

506
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:37,810
so I usually will send them on Monday.

507
00:59:38,050 --> 00:59:43,660
So I'll give you the weekend update on Monday. Hey, everyone, this is the assignment that's due on Wednesday.

508
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:46,900
These are the readings. This is what we're talking about on Thursday,

509
00:59:47,650 --> 00:59:53,140
just to make sure we don't get lost in the clutter of the other classes you're taking in in this class as well.

510
00:59:56,570 --> 00:59:59,800
Questions. And this is the boring part.

511
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:06,670
This is where we got to go over everything. Okay, surf save.

512
01:00:06,690 --> 01:00:10,000
So we over this a little bit already.

513
01:00:10,420 --> 01:00:17,110
We're trying to see if there's anything I've missed here. We have three assignments.

514
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:22,149
So next week, you will have you'll be registering to take your surf, to have exam.

515
01:00:22,150 --> 01:00:30,160
And that's a surf save. Quick quiz. So not really quiz. It's just to reinforce that you've scheduled that exam and then a surf save assignment,

516
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:33,850
which is actually a discussion and those will be due every week.

517
01:00:34,750 --> 01:00:38,319
We talked about the surf new manager exam, so I really like that.

518
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:42,070
In this course you're able to get surf themes certified so that when you go into your internship,

519
01:00:42,070 --> 01:00:46,030
are you going to work in a food service location in the future? You already have that taken care of.

520
01:00:46,990 --> 01:00:51,370
If you already have a surf saved manager certificate, which some of you do,

521
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:57,190
please let me know because you will be exempt from the Surf Save section in this course, which is kind of a big deal.

522
01:00:57,340 --> 01:01:01,300
So I don't want you to go do that twice. If you've already been surf, they've certified.

523
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:08,140
What you'll do is just you can tell me after class, you can email me, but I'll have you email me your certificate.

524
01:01:08,380 --> 01:01:17,830
It has to be still applicable. Has that you get renewed for surf save every five years and preferably it is a surf safe manager one.

525
01:01:17,830 --> 01:01:23,260
So there's a few different types of surf. Save this a surf save food handler course.

526
01:01:23,590 --> 01:01:28,480
But we cover the manager content, which is a little bit different than the food handler content.

527
01:01:30,250 --> 01:01:35,470
And then the week that you're taking the service of exam, we won't have class that week because I want you to focus on studying.

528
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:43,230
Now a tricky part with Surf Save is that you just need to pass it.

529
01:01:43,380 --> 01:01:49,680
And I make it like that in this class because that's how the, the the exam is, how a dietetic exam is.

530
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:51,750
You just want to pass it. We don't care about your score.

531
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:59,879
I know scores are really important in graduate school right now, but let me tell you in after this, we're not going to care about your grades so much.

532
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:03,240
So we want you to pass. We want you to know the content and move on.

533
01:02:03,540 --> 01:02:08,280
It's all going to be in your brain, I promise. But you need a 75% to pass the exam.

534
01:02:08,490 --> 01:02:16,800
Okay, so if you score 75% on surf safe, you'll get all 50 points that surf shave is worth in this course.

535
01:02:17,310 --> 01:02:22,890
If you score under 75%, your score will be adjusted to reflect the points out of 50.

536
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:28,890
So for example, you score 70% on the surface of exam, you'll earn 35 out of the 50 points.

537
01:02:30,060 --> 01:02:39,750
Makes sense. So it's kind of all or nothing. In the past, if students haven't passed the exam on the first try, we have done a remake day.

538
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:48,030
That was when we had a surf, say Proctor. So to be a surf, say Proctor in search of instructor, you need to be certified by surf.

539
01:02:48,030 --> 01:02:50,639
Say, which I am not. That's why we're doing the online modules.

540
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:56,790
I'm actually not able to teach you the course content because I'm not trained to be a surf slave instructor myself,

541
01:02:57,900 --> 01:03:00,809
so he has always had a second testing date, if need be.

542
01:03:00,810 --> 01:03:05,340
We all want to pass in the first time ideally, but if not, I totally get if you want to try again.

543
01:03:05,670 --> 01:03:11,520
So I think what we'll have to do if someone does a pass and you want to retake it, you'll have to purchase another exam code.

544
01:03:12,150 --> 01:03:14,430
But you're certainly welcome to do that if you want to,

545
01:03:14,970 --> 01:03:20,310
because I understand that the contents probably will be fresh in your mind and you just want to get it out of the way and get it done.

546
01:03:21,090 --> 01:03:26,910
So totally fine. Another word on that to surf save is very it's basic stuff, right?

547
01:03:27,030 --> 01:03:31,620
We talk about foodborne illnesses. We talk about food safety. There's just a lot of content.

548
01:03:31,620 --> 01:03:39,770
So. Just I guess what I'm saying is don't assume it's going to be easy when you're taking the exam.

549
01:03:39,780 --> 01:03:44,000
The exam can be really tricky. They like to ask questions in different ways.

550
01:03:44,870 --> 01:03:51,290
So make sure you study, make sure you're keeping up. Because once you have to take the exam, it could be a little rough for you if you don't.

551
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:55,690
And if you don't pass, the first time is totally okay.

552
01:03:55,700 --> 01:03:59,689
Like, it's not anything that you should worry about.

553
01:03:59,690 --> 01:04:03,260
You can take it again. It is tough. It's a tough exam.

554
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:08,030
So every year we have a few people who do really well and then some who don't do well.

555
01:04:08,030 --> 01:04:12,090
That's totally okay. And I'm here to help you. Any questions about of safe.

556
01:04:14,790 --> 01:04:18,480
Okay. Let's move on. So six assignments of 40% of total grade.

557
01:04:19,050 --> 01:04:26,310
They'll be available for one week. And I have indicate on the schedule when they're due, they open every Thursday at 10 a.m.

558
01:04:26,310 --> 01:04:29,730
So right after class, you definitely don't need to start it right after class.

559
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:34,260
But I open it just so you have that opportunity to work on it over the weekend and have that full week.

560
01:04:35,220 --> 01:04:39,000
I try really hard to be proactive with grading,

561
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:45,000
so I try to get your grade back within a week two so you can get feedback and you can use that feedback and future assignments to.

562
01:04:47,940 --> 01:04:52,860
All right. This is a really important part. The slate assignment policy.

563
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:57,790
I am very strict about this type assignment policy. I like to have fun in class.

564
01:04:57,810 --> 01:05:05,820
I like to talk to everyone. And, you know, this is kind of a more laid back class than some of the other courses you might take you may be taking.

565
01:05:05,820 --> 01:05:09,270
But I'm very strict about the slate assignment policy. So remember it.

566
01:05:10,020 --> 01:05:14,820
Keep it in your memory because it is real for every daily.

567
01:05:14,850 --> 01:05:17,960
10% is deducted from the assignment. Final score.

568
01:05:18,030 --> 01:05:27,030
So if you have assignment, do February 9th, 11:59 p.m. and you turn it in 1201 1202 it's 10% off.

569
01:05:27,540 --> 01:05:34,030
Okay. It's better to turn it in and get points than not at all.

570
01:05:34,690 --> 01:05:39,210
Definitely. If something happens, like life happens, we all have things going on outside of class.

571
01:05:39,220 --> 01:05:42,520
We have families, we have significant others. We have jobs.

572
01:05:43,660 --> 01:05:47,500
I understand that things can get a little hairy some time, but I ask that you let me know.

573
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:50,830
So be proactive if you need an extension. Happy to give it to you.

574
01:05:51,670 --> 01:05:55,540
Every semester I give extensions when things happen and students lives.

575
01:05:55,660 --> 01:06:01,330
But you need to let me know beforehand. If you don't let me know this later assignment policy will kick in.

576
01:06:02,300 --> 01:06:07,470
Make sense? Mm hmm. Okay. Okay.

577
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:12,790
So the final project again and we'll touch on this about in a month after we get of save under our

578
01:06:12,940 --> 01:06:19,630
under our belt here but we're going to form small groups will be six groups for this final project.

579
01:06:19,930 --> 01:06:23,830
You're going to be assigned randomly assigned to a food service establishment in Ann Arbor.

580
01:06:24,370 --> 01:06:30,549
The sites are Zingerman's Delis and your men's roadhouse, Luna Cafe.

581
01:06:30,550 --> 01:06:40,540
The cafe at the Art Museum. It's not we used to do Java Blue, but it's now the Taubman is the coffee place, Java Blue and Taubman.

582
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:44,950
So that one Miskin, the restaurant, Ann Arbor.

583
01:06:45,580 --> 01:06:53,610
And gosh, just one more. Forget it. What is it, Cisco here?

584
01:06:55,920 --> 01:07:00,770
Oh, Lou Cafe and Market at Mojo's. So right across the street, that's our new site for this year.

585
01:07:00,780 --> 01:07:06,600
We used to have just five, but I've added this one. So you'll be randomly assigned to one of these groups.

586
01:07:07,260 --> 01:07:11,729
We have a contact for each of these establishments that you'll be reaching out to

587
01:07:11,730 --> 01:07:15,809
and you'll either be connecting with on Zoom or you can meet up with them in person,

588
01:07:15,810 --> 01:07:22,010
whatever your preferences. And you're going to be learning about their establishment, their operations,

589
01:07:22,650 --> 01:07:27,900
kind of giving a lay of the land of how many workers they have, what are their schedules like, what are they serve?

590
01:07:27,900 --> 01:07:34,440
What's what's their menu like? You'll hopefully be getting a tour of the establishment, too.

591
01:07:35,190 --> 01:07:38,700
Usually it's in person, but we've had groups do it virtually too.

592
01:07:39,780 --> 01:07:43,870
This contact here, Jenny Santee, she made a video of the Zingerman's Deli.

593
01:07:44,010 --> 01:07:48,510
I think at the time, students weren't able to go back there to be able to tour the facility.

594
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:52,950
And then this foodservice case study, this written report.

595
01:07:53,250 --> 01:07:59,010
You'll be proposing marketing posts for social media.

596
01:07:59,010 --> 01:08:04,079
So you're going to find a product or create a combo or the like at this food service

597
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:09,420
establishment and creating just ideas of how you in-market this on social media.

598
01:08:11,140 --> 01:08:16,870
The part two of this is a presentation. So you're going to present what you said in your written report, essentially,

599
01:08:17,050 --> 01:08:20,380
and then you're going to talk about your social media marketing posts as well.

600
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:25,510
And then we also do peer reviews from this.

601
01:08:25,780 --> 01:08:29,200
And those are due where you at the end of the the class semester.

602
01:08:34,220 --> 01:08:41,420
So more on this later. I have a full write up that everyone will get and rubric for the written report and the presentation.

603
01:08:41,420 --> 01:08:44,960
So stay tuned. It will come. Okay.

604
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:49,040
Final grading score for the course. Pretty standard.

605
01:08:57,980 --> 01:09:01,410
I know. Okay. So, of course, policies.

606
01:09:01,430 --> 01:09:07,190
There we go. So what you can expect from me, I have this section of what you can expect from me.

607
01:09:07,370 --> 01:09:11,149
What I expect from you. I definitely want you to learn right.

608
01:09:11,150 --> 01:09:14,180
And be successful in this course. So, again, be proactive.

609
01:09:14,180 --> 01:09:18,979
If something isn't making sense, reach out to me and we'll meet up in office hours.

610
01:09:18,980 --> 01:09:22,940
We can talk it through, through email. I know everyone learns very differently.

611
01:09:22,940 --> 01:09:27,349
I'm a very kinesthetic learner, so if I read something, I just.

612
01:09:27,350 --> 01:09:34,340
I need to see it in action. I need to hear it. So we try to have multiple modes of learning in this class as best as possible.

613
01:09:35,730 --> 01:09:41,910
I'm very open to feedback, so I know sometimes you might not want to give feedback to an instructor.

614
01:09:42,210 --> 01:09:46,140
I'm telling you now I have very tough skin and I like to know what is working,

615
01:09:46,140 --> 01:09:50,250
what isn't working so we can pivot during the semester and make that change.

616
01:09:50,490 --> 01:09:53,640
There's been semesters where someone has told me, you know,

617
01:09:53,730 --> 01:09:58,890
something wasn't working like in March and I felt horrible because we could have changed that.

618
01:09:59,370 --> 01:10:05,939
But they came to me a little too late, so definitely let me know if something isn't going well and on the other side,

619
01:10:05,940 --> 01:10:09,810
if something is interesting or helpful to you for the future.

620
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:17,820
Or there's a group discussion that helped reinforce a concept, I really like to know that because I treat this course every semester,

621
01:10:18,030 --> 01:10:21,240
so that's really helpful information for me to know going forward.

622
01:10:23,500 --> 01:10:30,879
Try to be responsive. So I monitor my email. I'm on my email all day, so you will probably hear from me or hear back from me relatively soon.

623
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:34,420
But again, give me that 24 to 48 hour buffer just in case.

624
01:10:36,340 --> 01:10:39,170
And then you can also expect clear guidelines and prompt feedback.

625
01:10:39,190 --> 01:10:46,000
So as many of you said in our in our group breakout and seems to be really important to you and I try really hard to do that.

626
01:10:46,750 --> 01:10:55,540
I myself have taken courses where I didn't get this the grade for my assignment or feedback until weeks or months later.

627
01:10:55,540 --> 01:11:01,780
And that's not very helpful because if you made a mistake, you can't correct that mistake on future assignments, right?

628
01:11:01,990 --> 01:11:08,980
So I try to finish everything, finished grading everything within a week, get that feedback to you so you know how you're doing in the class.

629
01:11:09,130 --> 01:11:11,980
So there's no surprises at the end of the at the end of the semester.

630
01:11:12,730 --> 01:11:17,890
And again, any questions and assignments, project instructions, please email me or talk to me and we can clarify that.

631
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:24,020
And then what I expect from you are I talked about this but please the class.

632
01:11:25,210 --> 01:11:28,170
There's really no other substitute to bringing this material to life.

633
01:11:28,180 --> 01:11:34,810
A lot of these concepts that we're going to be talking about, two managerial concepts, leadership system concepts.

634
01:11:35,110 --> 01:11:38,800
They can be very abstract. I know when I was first learning about food service,

635
01:11:39,460 --> 01:11:45,400
it was very difficult for me to understand what was going on without seeing it or talking about it.

636
01:11:45,610 --> 01:11:47,950
So class is really here for that.

637
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:55,690
Again, I don't take attendance, so it's everyone's choice to be here or not, but it's really important to attend class and participate.

638
01:11:55,870 --> 01:11:58,629
So again, very abstract concept that we're talking about.

639
01:11:58,630 --> 01:12:02,890
So hopefully the group breakout session that we'll have will help solidify those and give you an

640
01:12:02,890 --> 01:12:08,350
opportunity to ask some questions and work with your group members on different problems I posed to you.

641
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:13,850
Be proactive. So we've mentioned this one again.

642
01:12:15,660 --> 01:12:19,710
I can't help you unless you don't tell me. Right. Basically the gist of the section.

643
01:12:20,010 --> 01:12:23,670
I want to know if you're having a hard time or if you're struggling with the course content.

644
01:12:23,910 --> 01:12:27,630
If it's too much and you need an extra day, you need extra week.

645
01:12:28,530 --> 01:12:32,760
If something happens in your life or you're not able to complete something, definitely let me know.

646
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:40,260
I'm definitely able willing to give extensions on things, but I need to know I can't help you unless you tell me.

647
01:12:42,530 --> 01:12:44,090
And then complete assignments.

648
01:12:44,330 --> 01:12:52,069
So everything submitted on canvas in this class, I don't think there's any situation where you email me besides one situation I can think of,

649
01:12:52,070 --> 01:13:00,470
but all your assignments will be submitted on canvas. So they, you know, have your eye on the time of when things are due.

650
01:13:00,890 --> 01:13:07,220
I have a nice schedule and layout of when assignments are due on the next pages of the syllabus here.

651
01:13:08,150 --> 01:13:11,510
But again, sometimes things happen outside of our control.

652
01:13:11,660 --> 01:13:18,250
Let me know. Happy to give you an extension. And then seek help if you need it.

653
01:13:18,910 --> 01:13:23,860
I think most of us your second year right there, any first year, sometimes they get a first year.

654
01:13:23,890 --> 01:13:33,140
No, I know you're in the last semester and people get angsty the last few months, but keep your eye on the prize.

655
01:13:33,160 --> 01:13:38,000
Get help if you need it. U of M is a great campus obviously for giving support.

656
01:13:38,020 --> 01:13:41,740
I know it's huge, but again, multiple ways of getting assistance.

657
01:13:42,160 --> 01:13:46,520
We have caps or counseling services while being for U of M students.

658
01:13:46,540 --> 01:13:53,140
My Top Stress Busters app. You can click on these later on your own time too, if you haven't heard of them,

659
01:13:54,130 --> 01:13:58,090
but make sure you take note of the opportunities here if you need them.

660
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:03,370
The emergency fund requests to help with any emergency situations that you may have.

661
01:14:03,370 --> 01:14:10,290
Any unforeseen expenses that you might encounter. I'm pretty sure everyone knows about the maize and blue cupboard, right?

662
01:14:11,450 --> 01:14:16,760
For Sexual Assault Prevention Awareness Center, the CPAC chat and the writing lab.

663
01:14:20,940 --> 01:14:26,090
And if anyone needs any accommodations, please make sure you have an assessed ability letter sent to me.

664
01:14:26,100 --> 01:14:32,940
I think you work with SSD with that and we'll make sure that your accommodations are are complied with and implemented.

665
01:14:38,100 --> 01:14:41,569
We have a commit to integrity section. So obviously cheating is not tolerated.

666
01:14:41,570 --> 01:14:49,129
Plagiarism isn't tolerated for assignments. I often will have you cite using APA format and references that you use.

667
01:14:49,130 --> 01:14:53,890
So I have links in there just to give you a reminder if you need them. I love the owl at Purdue site.

668
01:14:53,960 --> 01:15:00,110
Does everyone still use that? So yeah. The best thing I've been using it since I was an undergrad hasn't really changed.

669
01:15:00,110 --> 01:15:07,220
But make sure you are giving credit to what you are referring to in your assignments and your papers as well.

670
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:20,390
And then our support DNA. So it has been very tough to me, I'm going to admit to include DNI, contact and food service because it's not always.

671
01:15:22,190 --> 01:15:24,559
Like these things we have seen in food service.

672
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:31,400
But there are certain sections where we might have some conversations that bring in some topics of what we can see in future,

673
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:35,300
especially because it's a very diverse, very diverse field.

674
01:15:35,420 --> 01:15:42,810
Right. So always make sure we're treating everyone with respect when we're talking, having discussions, appreciating everyone's opinion,

675
01:15:43,070 --> 01:15:50,870
having intelligent conversations, making sure we're not, you know, squashing someone's views down and that sort of thing to.

676
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:56,960
All right. That is all on that section.

677
01:15:58,250 --> 01:16:01,970
Some things I want to point out on the syllabus.

678
01:16:02,570 --> 01:16:05,960
So next three weeks, our staff save.

679
01:16:08,780 --> 01:16:13,280
We're not going to have virtual office hours on January 16th because MLK Day.

680
01:16:15,560 --> 01:16:19,250
No class this week because you're taking sort of save exam.

681
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:24,780
And then let's see here. Yeah, I was right.

682
01:16:24,780 --> 01:16:30,210
So February 9th is the week where we're going to talk about the Food Service Case Study Project in detail.

683
01:16:31,020 --> 01:16:34,080
You'll be assigned your food service establishments that day as well.

684
01:16:36,790 --> 01:16:45,300
Spring break is March 2nd. And then we also I think this through here is pretty self-explanatory.

685
01:16:45,310 --> 01:16:51,780
We do have a guest speaker late in the semester. So Keith Foster comes in and does a talk on sustainability and food service.

686
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:57,600
Keith is a really, really great resource. He is director of Sustainability and Community Engagement for dining.

687
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:00,840
He is awesome. He loves talking with students too.

688
01:17:00,850 --> 01:17:06,690
So every year I have him come in and talk about what U of M is doing for sustainability on campus, which is a ton.

689
01:17:07,620 --> 01:17:11,070
So it's always nice to have Keith come in and speak to everyone.

690
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:17,320
I want to say that is that these are the two dates for our final project presentations.

691
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:22,960
Regardless of when your group is presenting, please be here to support your fellow classmates too.

692
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:28,570
We usually split up presentations, so there'll be three groups presenting on one day, three groups presenting on the other day.

693
01:17:29,530 --> 01:17:36,520
And for those seven days of presentations will everyone's presentations and the same day presenting different things.

694
01:17:37,870 --> 01:17:45,220
So they're due at. On Wednesday, April 12, and then you present on Fridays.

695
01:17:46,990 --> 01:17:54,309
And then if anyone has a conflict, I know people start traveling around this time just getting near the end of the semester.

696
01:17:54,310 --> 01:17:58,930
If there's a conflict with any of these dates, please let me know ASAP so I can make sure that,

697
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:02,890
you know, you're presenting on the day that you're you're going to be here if you have a conflict.

698
01:18:05,450 --> 01:18:12,950
All right. There's a lot of questions. What questions do you have for those services exam or questions on there?

699
01:18:13,290 --> 01:18:17,810
They sometimes overlap with questions we'll see on the exam at all. Or is that kind of like a totally different.

700
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:22,390
That's a good question. In my experience, the answer is no.

701
01:18:22,690 --> 01:18:28,930
It's kind of a it's a separate entity. I know when I was in school to be an R.D.

702
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:32,620
Like we didn't take surf, so before the dietetic exam.

703
01:18:33,490 --> 01:18:46,650
So now they're pretty separate. That's a good question. What else was your reason for going on about practicing the survey?

704
01:18:47,330 --> 01:18:50,880
QUESTION Think I do. That's a really good question.

705
01:18:50,900 --> 01:18:59,260
So under the Surf Save Unit five sea test prep materials, that's what you're asking for, like practice exams.

706
01:18:59,560 --> 01:19:05,340
I have practice exams for you, so I have four of them here. One of them's a little a little funky.

707
01:19:05,350 --> 01:19:08,890
I think one of the pages got missed when copying.

708
01:19:09,250 --> 01:19:14,950
So if you see that later on, that's why. But we have four practice exams here with keys to help you.

709
01:19:15,560 --> 01:19:18,740
Now the question. What else?

710
01:19:23,590 --> 01:19:28,630
Yeah. I want to see how long it takes. You get 2 hours to take the exam.

711
01:19:31,160 --> 01:19:35,890
Is anyone done? The proctor you had online exams and after Colvin I'm sure I've got.

712
01:19:36,350 --> 01:19:40,100
It's a really good system. I actually recertified.

713
01:19:41,190 --> 01:19:47,640
With the modules through Proctor you Proctor you two years ago and it was super smooth.

714
01:19:47,830 --> 01:19:51,630
It's weird if someone's, like watching you, but it was really easy to do.

715
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:55,170
So I really like having students do it that way.

716
01:19:58,420 --> 01:20:08,440
What else? That's what's. All right, so some things.

717
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:15,500
See about the canvas page. All the modules are here and it's split up by week.

718
01:20:16,490 --> 01:20:25,130
Every week. You'll see the assignment section and I try to highlight and bold and complete those by this day it's due then.

719
01:20:26,720 --> 01:20:34,820
So everything that you need to do will be listed right here. There'll be links to the assignments here under each module.

720
01:20:39,420 --> 01:20:48,780
For Surf Save. I also have optional note taking guides, so I believe when you purchased your online manager exam, you do get access to all of these.

721
01:20:49,110 --> 01:20:53,190
But I just post them here because it's easier, so just know that they're there.

722
01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:59,309
These are really handy. It's highly recommended that you're taking notes as you're listening to the modules,

723
01:20:59,310 --> 01:21:02,970
or else you might have to go back and listen to the modules over and over and over again.

724
01:21:03,810 --> 01:21:07,560
So you're welcome to use these note taking guides.

725
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:13,260
If you don't like them, you can just take notes on your own. I have had feedback from students that say that these.

726
01:21:14,260 --> 01:21:18,160
These closely match the modules in the content, but not exactly so.

727
01:21:18,580 --> 01:21:24,790
Just know that when you're. When you're using them. It's with us.

728
01:21:28,700 --> 01:21:36,080
Due to. Its elements are also here.

729
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:41,270
So you can see I believe students can see this. You can see everything that's going to be do.

730
01:21:43,240 --> 01:21:47,230
That's pretty much it. Hopefully pretty self-explanatory and clear.

731
01:21:50,920 --> 01:21:54,910
All right. So I believe we were very due for a break.

732
01:21:54,970 --> 01:21:59,140
So sorry about that. But let's take 5 minutes.

733
01:21:59,890 --> 01:22:15,380
We'll come back around about 930 and then we'll kick off about more features for you.

734
01:22:15,790 --> 01:22:35,770
Things I wanted a feeling that they're not going to be understood and now I am as you get to one so much that I know.

735
01:22:35,890 --> 01:22:40,660
Sorry. And again, what is that?

736
01:22:40,870 --> 01:22:45,670
I have to print out at least one, I think. Oh yeah, whatever.

737
01:22:45,910 --> 01:22:50,469
I'm usually the only one I know at the start.

738
01:22:50,470 --> 01:22:56,070
It's always a lot of information. The story is I just have to get listen to her.

739
01:22:59,260 --> 01:23:01,516
So I also have all that in like Italian though that color is good for me to design.

740
01:23:07,333 --> 01:23:13,683
Oh, but start at the beginning. So there you go.

741
01:23:15,063 --> 01:23:20,073
So next few slides, we're going to talk about food service industry in general,

742
01:23:20,073 --> 01:23:24,543
why dietitians are important in food service and what to expect the next few weeks or in the

743
01:23:24,543 --> 01:23:30,033
next semester for this class already mentioned that I'm personally a huge fan of food service,

744
01:23:30,393 --> 01:23:34,113
which is not always the case with dietitians in general.

745
01:23:34,113 --> 01:23:36,932
And my hope again is that by the end of the semester,

746
01:23:36,933 --> 01:23:43,623
you also think food service is a little bit more cooler than you think it is now, if not cool, as opposed to not cool right now.

747
01:23:43,893 --> 01:23:50,463
But one of the reasons why I personally love food service and people who work in food service like is that it's super fast paced, right?

748
01:23:50,793 --> 01:23:55,232
You're always on the go. I know some of you mentioned backs hurting, food hurting.

749
01:23:55,233 --> 01:24:01,173
Yeah. Because you're standing the whole time. You're walking, you're visiting patients, you're talking to customers, you're serving meals.

750
01:24:02,733 --> 01:24:09,783
So obviously there's ways to mitigate that. We don't want you to be in pain for food service, but it's very, very fast paced and it's high energy.

751
01:24:10,323 --> 01:24:18,423
Food service is really cool too, because we always have to stay on top of changing standards, laws and policies, which some of you mentioned to.

752
01:24:18,463 --> 01:24:22,113
We wanted to talk about legal ramifications in food service.

753
01:24:23,253 --> 01:24:33,783
There's a lot of labeling laws. So in 2018, I believe that's when we had our new labeling law where restaurants who have more than 20 facilities,

754
01:24:33,783 --> 01:24:38,013
I think they need to share their nutrition information with everyone.

755
01:24:38,193 --> 01:24:43,232
And these laws are really important because when you have someone auditing your food service operation,

756
01:24:43,233 --> 01:24:50,073
if you're not complying with them, you get dinged, right. And it can be as small as a slap on the wrist.

757
01:24:50,073 --> 01:24:53,253
You know, fix it and stay open, too.

758
01:24:53,283 --> 01:24:56,523
We're going to close down your facility and you need to lay off your workers.

759
01:24:56,793 --> 01:25:02,433
So that's why these laws are super important, because if you don't comply with them, it's just not good.

760
01:25:02,473 --> 01:25:06,123
Not good for your people. It's not good for your your business either.

761
01:25:06,273 --> 01:25:08,613
Well, food service is fun, too.

762
01:25:08,613 --> 01:25:15,842
And it's interesting because there's so many different interpersonal conversations, relationships that you build from working there.

763
01:25:15,843 --> 01:25:22,683
So already talked about how food service is one of the areas where we see all four or five generations working there.

764
01:25:22,833 --> 01:25:28,563
We see people from all different walks of life. It's one of the most diverse fields to work in.

765
01:25:28,803 --> 01:25:37,473
So that's the reason that we need really strong communication skills, need to be able to explain things to lay individuals.

766
01:25:37,473 --> 01:25:40,952
We need to be able to explain things to people in C-suites.

767
01:25:40,953 --> 01:25:49,413
So CEOs, CFOs who are relying on you to provide food service to the organization and need to have good relationship skills, too, because.

768
01:25:50,353 --> 01:25:52,213
Often in managerial positions, too.

769
01:25:52,243 --> 01:26:01,033
You need to instruct workers, you need to instruct staff, you need to educate them on how to do the job and how to do it well and how to be safe also.

770
01:26:02,173 --> 01:26:04,993
But there is also is a really great way to move into management.

771
01:26:05,173 --> 01:26:11,053
So a lot of times what can happen, how a dietitian can move into management is their clinical dietitian.

772
01:26:11,233 --> 01:26:16,873
And they're working in the hospital and there's an opening in a manager position in the food service department.

773
01:26:17,083 --> 01:26:22,183
Because when you're working as a clinical dietitian in the hospital, you are having some sort of relationship with the kitchen.

774
01:26:22,393 --> 01:26:28,483
So maybe you're seeing a patient and their diet order is incorrect. So you need to talk to the food service department to change that, right?

775
01:26:29,623 --> 01:26:36,672
Often in food service, there are positions called patient services managers that they like to employ dieticians for.

776
01:26:36,673 --> 01:26:43,463
Not always, but it's a real plus of a dietitian is in that role because we are so knowledge about different diets,

777
01:26:43,463 --> 01:26:47,562
so cardiac diets, diabetes diets, renal diets.

778
01:26:47,563 --> 01:26:52,063
And so it's a really good idea to have a dietitian in that position so they can

779
01:26:52,063 --> 01:26:57,903
properly educate staff on the correct way of applying those diets to patients.

780
01:26:58,783 --> 01:27:03,133
And food service requires a really broad set of skills and knowledge base.

781
01:27:03,133 --> 01:27:07,423
So you definitely do use clinical nutrition information and food service.

782
01:27:07,723 --> 01:27:12,852
You use knowledge that you gain about purchasing procurement for purchasing.

783
01:27:12,853 --> 01:27:15,883
Is it a fancy or as a simple way to say procurement?

784
01:27:15,883 --> 01:27:20,832
They mean the same thing. It requires people skills.

785
01:27:20,833 --> 01:27:28,572
It requires high level organizational skills, requires skills about catering and presentation,

786
01:27:28,573 --> 01:27:33,313
because we want to make sure that people want to eat the food that your operation is setting out, right?

787
01:27:33,403 --> 01:27:40,033
So the food needs to look good. So food service is fine for a lot of different reasons and requires a lot of different skills on your part.

788
01:27:40,753 --> 01:27:46,723
And we need dietitians and food service. So update the statistic every semester.

789
01:27:46,723 --> 01:27:55,992
But it's expected that dietitians and nutritionists and jobs in food service will grow 7% from 2021 to 2031.

790
01:27:55,993 --> 01:27:59,323
So definitely on the rise about fast is average for all jobs out there.

791
01:27:59,803 --> 01:28:06,763
And one of the reasons to have a food service dietitian is that dietitians typically have a careful eye.

792
01:28:06,793 --> 01:28:14,383
We usually are very organized. We're very detail oriented, and you definitely need that in a fast paced environment like food service, right.

793
01:28:14,653 --> 01:28:20,383
So a lot going on. A lot of people working, a lot of information coming at you.

794
01:28:20,383 --> 01:28:25,983
So it really is a benefit to have a professional dietitian there who has that detailed

795
01:28:25,993 --> 01:28:29,773
mindset to make sure that things don't go awry or that things don't get missed.

796
01:28:30,343 --> 01:28:33,312
And sometimes when those things get messy, that's when safety is compromised.

797
01:28:33,313 --> 01:28:41,353
And it could be as small as, you know, I don't like pineapple and you give me pineapple and now I'm upset.

798
01:28:41,353 --> 01:28:45,523
And now I am submitting a comment card that I hate your your organization.

799
01:28:45,523 --> 01:28:51,673
But it could be as severe as I'm allergic to pineapple. And I had a really bad allergic reaction to pineapple that you served me.

800
01:28:51,943 --> 01:28:58,453
So that's why it's really important. And one of the reasons why it's important to have dietitians and food services for that food safety component.

801
01:29:02,623 --> 01:29:11,233
So Foodservice was already exciting, right? And then COVID happened, and COVID forever changed the food service system.

802
01:29:12,193 --> 01:29:15,343
I like this. I think this is from Twitter. Got some Twitter.

803
01:29:15,853 --> 01:29:19,093
I can't think of anyone who's had a better year than the QR code. Want to come back?

804
01:29:19,903 --> 01:29:27,073
Back in 2021? Because we have seen just wild changes in foodservice that I'm pretty sure are here to stay.

805
01:29:27,883 --> 01:29:33,522
We see menus with QR codes now. We see, you know, things like cocktail kits.

806
01:29:33,523 --> 01:29:36,673
This is early pandemic when businesses were closed.

807
01:29:37,303 --> 01:29:42,403
But these things are still here. We still can order them for people who don't want to go into a restaurant.

808
01:29:43,873 --> 01:29:54,103
We're seeing more paying on your phone. So, you know, contactless menu viewing, contactless paying COVID, not so much.

809
01:29:54,163 --> 01:29:59,833
Now, maybe some restaurants are still experiences, but we had a crazy adjustment of hours, right?

810
01:29:59,983 --> 01:30:06,163
Because restaurants couldn't be open all the time or they had to lay off a high amount of their staff.

811
01:30:06,523 --> 01:30:09,993
And we still have some businesses that haven't fully recovered from that.

812
01:30:10,003 --> 01:30:16,603
Granted, we had this acute phase of COVID happening and its impact on the foodservice system, which we'll talk about during this course.

813
01:30:16,603 --> 01:30:22,483
I think it's important to realize that pivotal change, but we still have businesses that aren't fully recovered yet.

814
01:30:22,513 --> 01:30:27,313
Some have, but some have not. We want outdoor dining, right?

815
01:30:27,553 --> 01:30:33,402
We've seen some places where that's here to stay, too. I hang out sometimes in downtown Northville.

816
01:30:33,403 --> 01:30:38,833
And downtown Northville has a really cute area, a lot of shops that are restaurants, if anyone's been down there.

817
01:30:39,043 --> 01:30:46,603
And during the pandemic, they started closing the streets down to allow for more tables in the roads so cars don't go down there.

818
01:30:46,813 --> 01:30:52,123
They wanted to expand their outdoor seating while the city and the people liked it so much, it's here to stay.

819
01:30:52,393 --> 01:30:56,083
So these changes are just widespread. It's really neat to see.

820
01:30:56,323 --> 01:31:01,663
And we're going to need to know about them in the future and able to have an impact.

821
01:31:01,663 --> 01:31:06,953
And in foodservice. Where can you work in food service?

822
01:31:06,953 --> 01:31:09,953
And this will come up later into the semester also.

823
01:31:10,733 --> 01:31:16,943
Number one place is hospitals. So hospitals are always looking for dieticians who work in food service.

824
01:31:17,243 --> 01:31:23,723
Large, large kitchens and hospitals. Obviously, it's anybody ever been in the Michigan Medicine Kitchen.

825
01:31:23,933 --> 01:31:30,713
It's huge, right. So and they also have crazy, huge equipment like mixing bowls.

826
01:31:31,523 --> 01:31:35,173
But we need huge kitchens like that to feed all of those patients there.

827
01:31:36,803 --> 01:31:43,702
Same thing for long term care facilities. Some are smaller, though, but really important to have dietitians and food service there to make sure that

828
01:31:43,703 --> 01:31:48,053
patients are adhering to diets for safety and further their medical needs.

829
01:31:48,563 --> 01:31:51,713
Schools, college, universities, we won't go through the whole list.

830
01:31:52,373 --> 01:31:57,803
Some little known ones that we need. Dietitians and food service at correctional facilities as well.

831
01:31:58,823 --> 01:32:05,453
Corporate offices increasingly have dietitians as a part of their wellness programs or working in their cafeteria

832
01:32:05,453 --> 01:32:12,413
to make sure that there's healthy options for people or just to inform staff at that place of things they can eat,

833
01:32:12,653 --> 01:32:18,293
help with labeling, help with marketing of those products, and then obviously restaurants, fast food even.

834
01:32:18,293 --> 01:32:24,803
Yes, we have a number of contract companies, too, that dietitians can be employed with through food service.

835
01:32:24,803 --> 01:32:31,883
So the big three are Sodexo, Aramark and Touch Point. When I worked in food service as a food service director, I was with Touchpoint.

836
01:32:32,123 --> 01:32:38,453
And these are contract companies that are contracted out of hospitals or have and will say,

837
01:32:39,053 --> 01:32:43,823
Hey, touch point, I want you to come in and be our food service company.

838
01:32:43,833 --> 01:32:47,453
So all of these staff, the hourly staff, our touchpoint employees,

839
01:32:47,453 --> 01:32:51,503
all the dietitians are touchpoint employees, their managers are touchpoint employees.

840
01:32:51,773 --> 01:32:59,332
And usually that's because of of money and budget. But you'll see that often with the contract companies and then vendors.

841
01:32:59,333 --> 01:33:04,613
So our big vendors are Sysco, U.S. food GFS or Gordon Food Service and Nestlé.

842
01:33:04,823 --> 01:33:10,793
So a lot like restaurants or fast food. We'll see dieticians working in there to help with labeling, to help with allergens.

843
01:33:11,033 --> 01:33:17,543
And if you like, data vendors like that are kind of a good route to go in if maybe you're not so

844
01:33:17,543 --> 01:33:21,713
interested in research because you're dealing with a lot of numbers and a lot of very,

845
01:33:21,713 --> 01:33:29,942
very small facts that need to be on food labels. This kind of goes along with the next slide, but what jobs can you have?

846
01:33:29,943 --> 01:33:34,473
So database management. There's a lot of systems, hospitals,

847
01:33:35,133 --> 01:33:41,383
colleges as well that have every single food that serve serving a cafeteria into a database

848
01:33:41,383 --> 01:33:47,252
that won't work for seaboard before you have a love hate relationship with Seaboard.

849
01:33:47,253 --> 01:33:56,103
But for those of you who haven't worked in the seaboard, it's a huge database and it, for example, is also still used for U of M.

850
01:33:56,283 --> 01:34:01,243
Yeah, we have room service choice now, but we use seaboard for some things too.

851
01:34:01,263 --> 01:34:07,233
Okay. It's used to be used. Maybe it's still used for the university dining also,

852
01:34:08,283 --> 01:34:14,853
but every single food that could be served either in a hospital or in campus dining halls is in seaboard,

853
01:34:15,033 --> 01:34:20,883
and that includes ingredients and includes allergens. You're able to print nutrition labels from seaboard.

854
01:34:20,883 --> 01:34:30,543
It's just it's a huge database. So that's obviously a high need for dietitians as well as all these other areas to menu design and recipe development,

855
01:34:31,113 --> 01:34:40,262
procurement or purchasing like we talked about before. And then managerial roles are obviously areas where dietitians can be so patient managers.

856
01:34:40,263 --> 01:34:44,523
Clinical nutrition managers are individuals who oversee teams of dietitians,

857
01:34:44,763 --> 01:34:50,523
usually at a hospital and a food service director who is overseeing entire department of food service.

858
01:34:53,763 --> 01:34:55,922
Lastly, I have this diagram here.

859
01:34:55,923 --> 01:35:02,193
So this is from your textbook, and this just shows that food service is highly related to many, many different parts.

860
01:35:02,493 --> 01:35:06,243
So over the course of the semester, we're going to go through each of these boxes,

861
01:35:06,243 --> 01:35:10,203
if you will, and hopefully near the end you're able to see how they all integrate.

862
01:35:10,443 --> 01:35:19,922
So aspects such as labor skills that the workforce has, that you're employing laws and regulations,

863
01:35:19,923 --> 01:35:26,013
meals, the quality of those meals, the quantity and satisfaction, how all of those intertwined together.

864
01:35:26,253 --> 01:35:29,373
That's essentially what makes a food service operation tick and run.

865
01:35:34,053 --> 01:35:40,623
Any questions? Super high level. I know, but just kind of giving you a lay of the land of what we're going to be talking about for the next few weeks.

866
01:35:45,203 --> 01:35:48,683
All right. So we have some additional resources here.

867
01:35:48,693 --> 01:35:54,533
So if you're interested, we can click on the links. This is another article.

868
01:35:54,533 --> 01:35:57,832
I think this is the one I have on campus here about supermarket dietitian.

869
01:35:57,833 --> 01:35:59,152
So that's pretty interesting.

870
01:35:59,153 --> 01:36:07,403
One can click on the Academy Nutrition Dietetics, Food Service Resources Food Service Director is a really cool magazine.

871
01:36:08,033 --> 01:36:14,843
They have a hard copy publication, but they have a really great website too, so that's good to check out as well as these other ones down here.

872
01:36:17,723 --> 01:36:18,923
And that's all we have for this week.

873
01:36:19,103 --> 01:36:27,142
So next week and I like to have this slide at the end of every lecture to let you know what's coming up next week, same time,

874
01:36:27,143 --> 01:36:33,893
same place, bright and early, what you'll be doing between now and the next class, you'll complete those saved modules.

875
01:36:33,893 --> 01:36:45,073
So the intro and then modules. One, two and three. This document right here you should have when you go into your serve save modules.

876
01:36:45,153 --> 01:36:48,273
Did anyone start opening the search save information yet?

877
01:36:48,513 --> 01:36:53,583
Usually they have a bunch of PDF files that you'll be reading along with the modules.

878
01:36:53,763 --> 01:37:01,683
I also have them linked on canvas too. But this document's really important because there's been some updates to the food code as of

879
01:37:01,683 --> 01:37:08,553
October 2018 and some of the information here is going to supersede information and other documents.

880
01:37:08,553 --> 01:37:15,753
And I know it's super clunky, but so or save as little as last time I caught this example attached to this course,

881
01:37:16,473 --> 01:37:18,572
they had an update some of these handouts.

882
01:37:18,573 --> 01:37:24,993
So I just want you to know that this document there might be changes to different like temperatures that you would cook a food to.

883
01:37:25,263 --> 01:37:30,543
They might replace information and documents that I have on the additional resources section.

884
01:37:30,903 --> 01:37:34,623
They may not make much sense now, but once you start digging into the modules, they will.

885
01:37:35,883 --> 01:37:42,813
And then what you'll have to do sort of assignment one is a discussion question and a discussion board and then do the search a quick quiz.

886
01:37:43,443 --> 01:37:46,473
And that's basically just saying, I scheduled to take the exam.

887
01:37:46,473 --> 01:37:50,863
This is the day and time I'm taking here. That's it.

888
01:37:51,763 --> 01:37:54,823
It's great to meet everyone. Any questions before we head out?

889
01:37:54,853 --> 01:37:59,203
I think you have class in here next race. You good? At a long time in the studio.

890
01:38:02,173 --> 01:38:08,473
Yeah. I mean, do you think you can take.

891
01:38:08,803 --> 01:38:13,572
Right? Yes. So you're scheduled to take it the week of.

892
01:38:13,573 --> 01:38:22,023
I could tell you right now. Right.

893
01:38:24,593 --> 01:38:44,703
When you go here. So Thursday you'll be scheduling to take it between Thursday, January 26, and Wednesday, January 1st.

894
01:38:44,913 --> 01:38:48,003
And if that week doesn't work for someone, let me know in the figure something out.

895
01:38:48,423 --> 01:38:51,693
Yeah. You're welcome. We do not have class on that Thursday.

896
01:38:51,693 --> 01:38:55,863
We don't have class the next Thursday. You don't have class on February 2nd?

897
01:38:57,043 --> 01:39:00,543
I'm not going to take that one. Yes.

898
01:39:01,153 --> 01:39:06,993
Yeah, I do that because historically we had students take the exam on the class date.

899
01:39:07,653 --> 01:39:10,743
So I'm giving you just a week off. Oh, yeah.

900
01:39:11,833 --> 01:39:15,183
I would have you really by then to take the exam.

901
01:39:15,483 --> 01:39:23,013
Oh, yes. It's been absolutely. What I'll be tested for is anything before that day that I learn.

902
01:39:24,543 --> 01:39:28,533
You'll be ready to take it. By then, you'll have completed all the modules and all the assignments.

903
01:39:28,653 --> 01:39:32,703
I'll be ready. You'll be ready. Cool. All right.

904
01:39:33,363 --> 01:39:38,073
All right. Well, thank you so much for coming, everyone. See you next week.

905
01:39:39,083 --> 01:39:43,313
Okay, let's on.

906
01:39:44,343 --> 01:39:50,643
Oh, [INAUDIBLE]. Oh, yeah. So I thought you have a certification already.

907
01:39:51,873 --> 01:39:55,293
How many emails about it?

908
01:39:55,593 --> 01:39:59,313
You said that? I said since. So what does that look like ever?

909
01:39:59,643 --> 01:40:03,723
So you essentially get 100% resources or. That's important.

910
01:40:04,383 --> 01:40:07,383
So then with a class attendance, do you want me to start?

911
01:40:08,133 --> 01:40:14,913
You can. Do I really like. So I get students who wanna learn how to contact before they go into their internship.

912
01:40:15,183 --> 01:40:18,803
If it's students just not home. So it's up to you. Okay. You could take them off.

913
01:40:19,093 --> 01:40:28,463
I just say that I would just make this like. I mean, I got my start today, so I'm not for you.

914
01:40:28,503 --> 01:40:32,223
Like, look, you know, that's a really great position right here.

915
01:40:32,383 --> 01:40:36,033
It's like I feel the need to do everything because I know you're good.

916
01:40:36,153 --> 01:40:41,133
Okay? Yeah, I think you are doing a great job.

917
01:40:41,133 --> 01:40:50,373
I'm not sure if happen again.

918
01:40:50,733 --> 01:40:53,973
I don't want her to easily find out. You know what I mean?

919
01:40:55,143 --> 01:40:55,603
You know?
