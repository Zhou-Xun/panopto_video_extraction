1
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:24,440
I know, I know. I mean, I know I didn't think about it.

2
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:35,759
And like I said, I was like minded to I guess I really didn't do anything.

3
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:41,740
They probably responded. But you're right about that.

4
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:55,880
You know, it was, you know, James and I.

5
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:08,580
And I think that's why you have to be so.

6
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:15,100
Yeah, it's like. It's like.

7
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:20,630
Yeah, but it takes so long. It's like.

8
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:35,700
It's like an hour. And then later when somebody is like, look, you excrete out from the server, it's like, you got to get out your man.

9
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:43,000
He won't answer you. You never know. Yeah, I just wanted to check in.

10
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:47,330
Excellent job on your first assessment.

11
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:50,850
I love some feedback from you.

12
00:01:51,230 --> 00:02:03,640
You see, is in fact, is because they know that I've gotten good results, like challenged enough and got the idea.

13
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:15,809
Okay, good, good. Yeah, we were really impressed with your ability to complete it and the responses you gave, so I was really happy about that.

14
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:23,550
So we're we're gaining some momentum and really getting a little bit comfortable in theory, which is good.

15
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,459
So today I want to talk about conceptual models and how to build a conceptual model.

16
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:35,770
That's the crux of your project. So I just want to go through some of the nuts and bolts of that.

17
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:44,879
They give you an opportunity to go through some examples and ask some questions so you have some tools

18
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:51,180
to get you started as you start to hone down a topic area and what you're going to build the model.

19
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:58,979
So the conceptual models by definition based on one of your readings,

20
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:08,100
which is essentially one of the seminal articles on building a conceptual model in your old classic.

21
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:16,319
And we still use it today. Um, so the definition of a conceptual model is essentially a diagram of proposed causal

22
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:22,500
linkages among instead of concepts believed to be related to a particular public realm.

23
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:30,300
So it's a bunch of concepts we put together around a particular public health problem.

24
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:37,590
But in building it, we're really focused on the causal language and the way it leads to what is good for outcome.

25
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,040
So we talked about this closer to the first day of class.

26
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:52,490
And when we think about a theory versus a conceptual model, there are some differences.

27
00:03:52,500 --> 00:04:02,300
So when we think about a theory, it's typically general in terms of broad application to different types of behavior.

28
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:06,169
But a conceptual model is very specific to your outcome of interest.

29
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:15,440
So you guys are going to hone in on a particular area in your broad topic and really try to drill down on what

30
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:23,750
are some outcomes that are really important in that area that we perhaps are having a hard time improving.

31
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:29,000
So my conceptual model will be very specific to your outcome of interest.

32
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:34,969
A theory needs to be testable. You can go to the conference with sort of the conceptual model.

33
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:42,200
You have to be able to measure the different constructs in various ways of be able to put some measurements behind it.

34
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:48,680
There's also the theory is also abstract, so it's not specified in super detail.

35
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:53,480
It tends to be pretty, you know, there are definitions, but it's still pretty broad.

36
00:04:54,380 --> 00:05:06,380
A conceptual model is fairly detailed in terms of defining the different constructs and variables and its relation to your outcomes.

37
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:15,669
So for example. You know, and the whole belief or the theory of planned behavior.

38
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:22,120
We had, um, we had attitudes, theory of the doctrine of behavior.

39
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:28,150
We talked about attitudes. That's pretty attitudes about what in a theory that can be pretty general.

40
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:32,730
Open your conceptual model. I want to know what these attitudes are around.

41
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:36,780
So I want you to get specific around what these attitudes are related to.

42
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:46,870
You have to be able, in a both theory and conceptual model, replicate the theory and hopefully the model and the linkages in the model.

43
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:51,400
I mean, in theory, the different linkages may or may not be supported.

44
00:05:52,060 --> 00:06:01,180
You may have a general because, as you say, people have not put some sort of empirical support around quite yet.

45
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:11,020
In a conceptual model. The different causal linkages should really be supported by either a theoretical understanding of that relationship,

46
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:17,110
which is typically supported by the literature, the empirical evidence, or just empirical evidence itself.

47
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:25,870
So the conceptual model, you can't sort of say one thing is related to another thing.

48
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:32,740
Um, you know, part of your assignment is going to be to defend those relationships.

49
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:39,100
And one difference is not necessarily that I, you know, I've seen it, you know, in front of me.

50
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:42,399
I've seen it before my eyes. But you have no data to back that up.

51
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:52,810
So I want you to be able to use research, use data, use established theoretical relationships to really support the relationships in your models.

52
00:06:55,650 --> 00:07:02,400
So the purpose of conceptual models is to summarize and integrate what we know.

53
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:11,310
It is to define concepts. Another purpose is to really provide explanation for those causal linkages.

54
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:23,940
We want to be able to generate hypotheses in terms of that that really specified area can generate hypotheses for very specific questions.

55
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:29,070
And most importantly, we want to be able to identify targets for intervention.

56
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:40,920
Often you can have an intervention model that's very small and related to the intervention that you are planning to deploy.

57
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:49,070
You can have a conceptual model. It's a little bigger than that, and it could potentially represent addressing several different interventions.

58
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:59,320
But you want to be able to define the problem enough in the conceptual model that it's pretty clear what those identified targets are for you.

59
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,500
So conceptual models can be very,

60
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:12,360
very helpful in terms of understanding the problem and making sure you have a solution that's aligned with that problem.

61
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:24,690
So when I was an MPM student a long time ago, I, I learned conceptual models in this class and then as a faculty member I ended up teaching this.

62
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:29,880
So a lot of familiarity with developing conceptual models based on what I learned in this class.

63
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:40,440
So then I had a friend who was an MP that I befriended when I was an MP student, and when I was a faculty member she ended up visiting town.

64
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:49,409
She was a consultant at health consulting firm and we're visiting and she was telling me about a project she was working on,

65
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:55,410
and this project was that she was being asked as part of her role to develop

66
00:08:55,410 --> 00:09:00,870
some sort of transportation system on an Indian reservation or a health clinic.

67
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:09,180
A lot of their clients and patients were having trouble accessing services due to transportation.

68
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:14,310
And as a health care consultant, she was being hired to develop a solution.

69
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:26,520
So she's playing around with Post-it notes, trying to figure out how to make sense of some sort of solution around this problem.

70
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:32,820
And as she was talking to me, I asked her, Well, did you develop a conceptual model?

71
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:39,510
She said, Well, I don't know what that is. What is that? And I said, Well, you know,

72
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:49,950
it's a mechanism for you to really define this problem around transportation issues in this very specific population you're working with.

73
00:09:49,950 --> 00:10:00,540
And that might help you figure out some sort of solutions that you might propose to this health system that has hired you.

74
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:06,690
Because it's in it can be on one page because it sounds like all these Post-its

75
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:10,980
are not really helping you because you're really not seeing what the problem is.

76
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,470
And so we took our theory book.

77
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:23,550
Remember, I had three editions on my bookshelf. We went to a coffee shop and he laid out the problem with one page,

78
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:32,639
and she was able to see the different sort of determinants that led to transportation challenges in the population she was working with.

79
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:39,440
And it made it a little bit easier for her to think about working with her team around a solution.

80
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:48,599
So nice real world, that sample where you know there's a lot of application to using this as a tool in your job.

81
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:55,920
When you're asked to solve a problem, come up with some sort of intervention and solution, and especially around healthcare consulting.

82
00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:01,830
So she was fortunate to be talking to someone who knew how to make a conceptual model,

83
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:09,230
but she was very, very she would wish she had taken in 600 as an Asian student when she was here.

84
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:14,790
So she definitely got to get this information out there.

85
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:23,640
So when we're thinking about conceptual models and definitions, I want to differentiate constructs and variables.

86
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:27,450
I mean, you probably hear variables a lot in bio stats.

87
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:34,950
So in thinking about constructs, these are the core components of a very specific theory.

88
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:41,280
So, you know, again, in the theory of reasoned action plan behavior,

89
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:50,700
there were a whole host of constructs that we talked about last week that were, you know, specific to that, those theories.

90
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,600
And then we have variables which are really the operational forms of the.

91
00:11:55,950 --> 00:12:02,780
And how the construct is measured. So variable means that there has to be variation.

92
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:09,150
So when we measure something, there has to be some variation to it, a range of possible.

93
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:19,200
Now there's these types of variables in a conceptual model.

94
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:31,650
There is the dependent or outcome variable, and this is the factor or condition and which is really the focus of your research or your intervention.

95
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:37,919
Your outcome could be reducing emergency department visits.

96
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:43,540
Your outcome could be of reducing death or incidence of illness.

97
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:56,250
Those are all examples of what outcomes are. So whatever you want to sort of get out of doing some sort of intervention and then you have predictor

98
00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:01,290
variables which are factors or conditions which influence or affects an outcome of insurance.

99
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:10,560
So in bio said, you will probably hear independent variable finding the same thing as a predictor.

100
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:21,989
So I'm going through some examples and I want to go through some very simplistic examples so we can get on the same page around these.

101
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:27,840
And these are all this is sort of foundational. Understanding is very important as you put together a conceptual model.

102
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:34,740
So in this example, our outcome might be physical activity levels that we're interested in.

103
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:39,600
And one potential predictor of that is physician's advice.

104
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:45,870
So a physician's advice could potentially influence our physical activity levels.

105
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:55,330
Then we have an antecedent variable, which is a background factor or condition.

106
00:13:55,930 --> 00:14:02,830
I mean, it's sort of this is something that comes earlier in the explanation of a relationship between two variables,

107
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:09,910
and that's the conceptual definition of that, and it really must be present for that relationship to even exist.

108
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:16,209
That's what we're talking about when we're talking about antecedents and statistics and regression.

109
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:24,430
Antecedent variables are typically described as control variables or variables that are related to both the predictor and.

110
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:30,760
So here's another example.

111
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:40,790
So again, an outcome that we're interested in might be physical activity levels and a physician's advice might be a predictor.

112
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:46,540
So one potential antecedent could be a physician's training.

113
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:53,200
If you don't if you're not trained to give advice around physical activity levels,

114
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:58,570
then this relationship between the predictor and the outcome likely does not exist.

115
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:10,960
So in order for that relationship to occur, the physician needs to be have some sort of training that's relevant to giving advice.

116
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:12,560
Missouri.

117
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:33,180
So in this example, I'm interested in the relationship between smoking cigarets, which is the predictor in lung cancer, which might be the outcome.

118
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:41,580
So one background factor or antecedent in this relationship might be the availability of Cigarets.

119
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:45,300
So it comes before the relationship of interest we're looking at here.

120
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:51,280
And this antecedent was already evident in this context.

121
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:59,190
So you can. Lung cancer smoking cigarets can't lead to lung cancer if we just cigarets don't even exist.

122
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:02,760
So that's why the availability of cigarets is.

123
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:21,790
So then we have mediating variables and these explain the relationship between a predictor and its outcome.

124
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:30,040
Mediating variable is caused by the predictor and at least partially explains how the predictor causes the outcome.

125
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:37,570
So in statistics, mediation is often partial mediation.

126
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:44,470
It's not that common that you have things that only a mediator fully explains an outcome.

127
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,580
It's often partial mediation is good enough to serve as a mediator.

128
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:07,550
So here's an example. An obesity might be our outcome of interest and stress might be our independent variable or predictor.

129
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:21,290
And was the mediator that might explain the relationship between stress and obesity is dietary intake so stress might lead to.

130
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:36,340
Dietary intake that leads to weight gain or other metabolic health issues and therefore could lead to obesity.

131
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:45,360
That sort of thing in the middle. How can you tell if we only had the second one?

132
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:53,010
How would we know that the dietary intake is the mediator and not the predictor and stress is not the antecedent.

133
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:59,440
So if someone just gave you some boxes. Yeah.

134
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,520
Or I don't know if you know that, like, stress can impact dietary intake.

135
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:07,900
Dietary intake can impact obesity. Like how?

136
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:16,270
I mean, if I don't make sense, like, how do you know if it's going to be a particular medium and outcome versus an antecedent predictor in outcome?

137
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:25,049
So it's a little bit like stepping back for a minute and thinking about your problems.

138
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:31,480
So I'm showing some very simplistic examples just to illustrate the variables that are the types of variables.

139
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:34,240
But as you're putting your conceptual model together,

140
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:45,550
I'm going to suggest you start around an outcome of interest, and perhaps your outcome is incidents of obesity.

141
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:52,030
That's the thing you're interested in and you're interested in understanding what are the things that.

142
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:59,730
Relate to that. What leads to increased incidence and obesity?

143
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:04,470
So then you might jot down dietary intake as a very immediate thing.

144
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:11,760
They you see some evidence around that leads to incidents of obesity.

145
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:20,010
But then that's not enough. You're so, you know, you're thinking about the socio ecological model and other sort of factors,

146
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:27,659
multiple levels of influence because dietary intake leading to obesity incidence is very individual level behavior.

147
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:33,660
But as a group. Maybe you're thinking about the social ecological perspective and thinking about, well,

148
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:39,780
there has to be other things in the environment that are leading to this sort of dietary intake.

149
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:50,430
So what are those things? And it could then be stress and stress might be the thing that we really want to focus on in our intervention.

150
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:59,160
And, you know, working backwards is really the relationship between stress and obesity is really dietary intake.

151
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:03,749
That's the mediator in that it's not perhaps the direct predictor.

152
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:11,970
But as I'm going further and further out, we need to define what these variables are a little bit.

153
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:16,950
So you may have started off with dietary intake as a predictor,

154
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:22,620
but then you decided to take the social ecological approach and go a little bit further out.

155
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:29,430
And then you suggest that, okay, now what do I have and how are these labels a little bit different?

156
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:35,790
Does that make sense? So it's kind of like school prayer, like, well, yeah, it makes sense.

157
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:42,780
Yeah. So it's not a it's a bit of an art, if you will.

158
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:50,729
So as you're putting your conceptual model together, you're going to have to think, you're going to have to ask yourself these questions.

159
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:53,459
Am I talking about the outcome, a mediator or predictor?

160
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:57,930
And there are more that we're going to talk about in terms of how they impact these different.

161
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:02,930
So here's another one.

162
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:10,310
Let's say I'm interested in understanding the relationship between medication use as a predictor of quality of life as an outcome.

163
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:19,300
I want to know what explains that relationship. I want to kind of understand the chain of factors between my predictor and outcomes.

164
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:22,430
Instead of flipping that previous example.

165
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:30,470
What if it was Fresno, B.C.? I was really interested in stress and obesity, and I was interested in understanding the chain of events in between.

166
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:34,640
So here, let's look at medication use and quality of life.

167
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:40,610
One thing that might explain this relationship is how controlled someone's chronic disease is.

168
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:47,030
So taking medication keeps heart disease under control and therefore improves our quality of life.

169
00:21:47,960 --> 00:22:03,590
So what? My potential? What might potential moderators between medication use and disease control be?

170
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:09,950
So if I wanted to know what changes the relationship between medication use and disease control,

171
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:21,260
I might added another variable, pointing to the arrow, indicating that it's the dose which would be the moderator here if.

172
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:35,350
Sorry my science got messed up there. So I want to this is a mediation example, so disease control really explaining that.

173
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:46,630
But if I wanted to know if this relationship between medication use and disease control changes, which it probably does,

174
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:54,940
that the thing that we might not be thinking about when explaining that relationship is a change in that relationship.

175
00:22:54,940 --> 00:23:02,240
As a matter of some factors that change the relationship between two variables change versus explain.

176
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:08,440
The change is a moderator and in this example something that might change the

177
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:13,000
relationship between medication use and disease control is the dose of your medication.

178
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:19,190
There can be many other things, but that's one example. Yeah.

179
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:23,540
So like just kind of paint the image in my head a little bit.

180
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:30,920
So moderating variable would be like an arrow pointing down between the arrow between medication use and disease control.

181
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:36,440
Exactly. Yeah, because it changes that relationship.

182
00:23:54,890 --> 00:24:03,860
So in this example, we might be interested in understanding the relationship between hitting a ball and winning the game and thinking

183
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:11,690
about the context of baseball and want to maybe know what are the things that explain that relationship.

184
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:16,370
By the time I hit the ball and win the game, what happens in between?

185
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:26,000
So one of those things is scoring a homerun that might explain that relationship between hitting the ball and winning the game.

186
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:39,740
And I might also be interested in what might explain the relationship between hitting the ball and scoring a homerun.

187
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:44,299
What might change that relationship, in fact?

188
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:51,920
And one thing that might change that relationship, where it might point to narrow narrowly choice by to the error that's between hitting the

189
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:59,540
ball and scoring a homerun is how hard is the ball that might change that relationship?

190
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:07,260
So again, a moderating relationship.

191
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:14,540
Variable is the relationship between the predictor and outcome being influenced by different levels of improvement.

192
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:22,850
So you can hit the ball really hard, you can hit the ball not so hard, or you can totally miss it.

193
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:27,710
And that might change the relationship between hitting the ball and getting a homerun.

194
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:43,620
So let's look at another one that I'm. Where we have physician training as the antecedent which may predict,

195
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:49,680
which may lead to the prediction of physician advice leading to physical activity levels.

196
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:59,310
One potential moderator that we might consider in this kind of simplistic example is exercise knowledge.

197
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:03,180
So a physician can give you some advice on what might change.

198
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:13,890
The relationship between that advice and one's physical activity levels might be their knowledge of exercise in general.

199
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:30,050
And then here's another relationship. Say, we want to look at the relationship between our job as a predictor and our earning potential as an outcome.

200
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:35,900
This is something that might change. That relationship is age.

201
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:40,070
So it could be that younger people may.

202
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,580
One possibility is they may earn less than older people.

203
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:51,200
So this would be a moderator. Another moderator might be work experience of an individual.

204
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:56,180
People with less work experience may earn less than a job than people with more work experience.

205
00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:08,540
Um, a lot of the empirical relationships are very strong direct relationships, and some things simply aren't meant to have a mechanism.

206
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:14,870
So you don't necessarily have to, when you're building your conceptual models, force the thing in between.

207
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:19,010
There are a lot of direct relationships that have a lot of strong evidence behind that.

208
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:23,330
They are they may be very strongly correlated.

209
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:33,430
So there may not be any reason to put a mediator in between to explain it unless you have a really well in the system.

210
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:44,160
So they may very well be mediators out there, but when you're putting your conceptual model together, you know,

211
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:54,950
think about the relationships you're trying to explain and don't force a type of relationship if it doesn't make sense and connecting to your outcome.

212
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:13,290
So another moderator example, let's say we're interested in looking at the relationship between exercising and weight reduction.

213
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:20,270
And now let's say this relationship is really strongly correlated because of this moment.

214
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:23,730
Consider a mediator in explaining this chain of events.

215
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:29,670
One thing that might change the relationship between exercising weight reduction is the length of your workouts.

216
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:37,800
So people who exercise longer may lose more weight compared to people who exercise for shorter periods of time.

217
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:42,300
Now, I'm not necessarily saying this is true. I'm just using it as an example.

218
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:48,689
So your length of workouts might be a moderator if there is really strong empirical

219
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:52,680
support that exercising and weight reduction are really strongly correlated.

220
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:13,440
Any questions? Like sort of repeating myself with examples, is this looking?

221
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:22,600
Yeah. So I'm going to skip over a few. You can.

222
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:30,370
I posted all these slides so you can sort of go through this yourself if you want a little more practice.

223
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:39,950
So. In the hope belief model.

224
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:48,440
Bringing this one back to the modifying factors make a little more sun snow like why we call them modified masters or moderators.

225
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:52,160
They change our individual beliefs.

226
00:29:52,670 --> 00:30:03,470
So in one of the examples I showed you, it was really another arrow pointing at an arrow, pointing at the arrow of that relationship.

227
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:11,400
This is a direct arrow. So that's also means modifying you point it and call it that.

228
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:17,629
Here we're saying these are modifying factors that change all of these individuals

229
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:23,630
who are have the potential to change people's individual and vary as well.

230
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:38,050
So just want to give a warning. So you're not actually.

231
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:42,480
Spinning your head around. This is your building, your conceptual model.

232
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:49,479
This next relationship is not something you'll explicitly describe as an explanation and a conceptual model.

233
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:55,600
It's something to look out for as you're building it. So I want to talk about confounding.

234
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:02,530
It's a variable that's related to both the predictor and outcome variable that when accounted

235
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:08,620
for may result in some sort of misleading association between a predictor and an outcome.

236
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:22,100
And we think about confounding a lot in statistics and a conceptual model and something to think about, you know,

237
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:28,830
in terms of how you statistically adjust for it, that that's just a whole other thing that's outside the scope of this costs.

238
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:40,769
So one that maybe we're interested in or someone is interested in the relationship between sex practices and outcomes.

239
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:46,990
And you might be wondering how are these things really how do these things possibly.

240
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:56,150
So one confounding variable might be alcohol consumption,

241
00:31:56,360 --> 00:32:04,459
which means the relationship where alcohol consumption might lead to risky

242
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:12,200
sex practices and smoking and alcohol might be two things that run together.

243
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:16,130
And if we don't account for alcohol consumption,

244
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:24,350
then we we can't necessarily say that the relationship between smoking and sex practices is a valid relationship.

245
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:37,220
And again, making just a simplistic example here of something that you don't in California could potentially lead to out.

246
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:43,200
Here's another one.

247
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:54,509
We might be interested in understanding the number of emergency department visits per year as an outcome of asthma symptoms leading to that.

248
00:32:54,510 --> 00:33:01,290
So your asthma symptoms leading to how many emergency department visits you have in the year?

249
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:10,610
Well, one confounding variable of that in the context of asthma is the timing of symptoms and time of day and season,

250
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:14,630
because people with asthma might not have symptoms all the time.

251
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:17,510
Some people do. Some people it's very seasonal.

252
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:25,610
So in terms of thinking about how our asthma symptoms relate to number of emergency department visits a year,

253
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:30,770
you have to think also think about the timing of the symptoms, the day, the season.

254
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,540
And if you don't understand that,

255
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:41,300
it might lead to a misleading association between someone's asthma symptoms and how often they go to the emergency department in a period of time.

256
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:57,470
Any questions about these different types of relationships that you think through in your conceptual models?

257
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,079
Yeah, I want the slides on curves.

258
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:07,340
I don't know if we just need, but they're not showing like these like showing asthma symptoms and a number of emergency department visits.

259
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:12,170
It's not saying like combining variables predict the outcome, timing of symptoms.

260
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:18,650
Okay. I can post these after class. Okay. Yeah. I just want to have you guys follow along,

261
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:29,170
but I'll make sure that you also have these in case there's some sort of typo in you taking notes or maximum.

262
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:38,930
So in relation for like asthma symptoms in emergency like E.R. visits, where would like construction work or like environmental exposure.

263
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:46,290
Like, would that be confounding variable or would it be like a moderate?

264
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,460
Like a moderate in like a borderline variable?

265
00:34:51,590 --> 00:35:05,030
That's a good question. So, um, it's not necessarily the case that everyone might be in a construction situation or people who might have asthma,

266
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:08,280
but it may be relevant to a subset of people.

267
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:15,530
So I think that's a great example of that could be relationship where the type of work you might be doing needs to

268
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:21,830
be taken into account when you're thinking about the relationship between symptoms and emergency department visits.

269
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:25,639
Because if you don't take that into account,

270
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:34,010
that could be misleading because someone in the construction business just may have a lot more exposure as compared to a different occupation.

271
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:41,330
Yeah, there's a the double headed arrow between as one timing and then only a single heading.

272
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:44,810
Can you just explain that a little bit more with that double headed means?

273
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:51,110
So divided means they influence each other. So the timing of symptoms.

274
00:35:54,860 --> 00:36:02,450
Actually, that's the wrong arrow. I apologize. So that should not be a double header there and I'll fix that before posting slides again.

275
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:12,320
It should really be, as my symptoms are pointing at typing of symptoms and not together in the other example with smoking and alcohol.

276
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:16,490
That is a double headed arrow because in that example,

277
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:21,950
there's the assumption that those three things are running together alcohol consumption and smoking.

278
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:46,560
We got this. So I'm going to. Skip the other examples and have you go through them on your own.

279
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:53,340
And again, I'll post the slides after class. So let's just do a little quiz out loud.

280
00:36:53,430 --> 00:37:00,540
So what is Boxy? What about D?

281
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:11,460
I heard all kinds of things. How many of you guys think it's medium?

282
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:19,290
MODERATOR. Founder.

283
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:30,550
So it's a moderator. What about a C mediator?

284
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:36,900
A protector and B, confounder.

285
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:51,059
Right. So we're going to walk you through the steps of developing a conceptual model.

286
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:58,580
So we think about interventions in behavior of interest.

287
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:08,130
Any given behavior includes that action, a target, the context in the time period that the behaviors of observed are expected.

288
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:24,389
So here's an example of how to reduce sexual activity and how you might break that down, that behavior down in terms of the action, the target,

289
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:35,730
the context in time period and interventions in general should really align with very specific behaviors and getting specific around these elements.

290
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:45,570
So the goal of changing behavior in a public health framework is to improve some sort of health status or health behavior.

291
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:53,670
So when we think about different outcomes, often health status, we think about our distal outcomes.

292
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:56,910
That's the thing, just no means it's a little far away.

293
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:03,600
Health status sometimes just takes a while to get to where we want to be and in between,

294
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:09,240
more proximal might be the behaviors we engage in to get to improve health outcomes.

295
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:16,940
So what is an outcome? It really is what results from a behavior or action.

296
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:26,160
And again, proximal versus distal proximal or really short term consequences, immediate consequences of an intervention.

297
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:30,680
Often they might be behavioral, so you might have behavioral outcomes.

298
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:36,020
Um, and then distal. Again, we're thinking of long term consequences.

299
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:39,829
And in a public health framework it's often related to health.

300
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:45,710
So thinking about some sort of marker of health status related to that particular contact.

301
00:39:49,350 --> 00:39:58,330
So I go through this because one of your first exercises is figuring out an outcome or an issue that you're interested in.

302
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:01,290
What are the relevant outcomes? You're not going to make them up.

303
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:07,499
You're going to look at the literature and understand what are the what are the relevant

304
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:13,980
outcomes that society is interested in when it comes to that particular health problem.

305
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:19,020
So for example, in the context of chronic disease, let's go back to that as an example.

306
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:31,319
We go to the asthma clinical guidelines when it comes to important outcomes of improving asthma for society, there's health care utilization.

307
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:37,680
So we know that asthma contacts, if we keep people out of the hospital, we keep people out of the emergency room.

308
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:42,000
That means we have managed asthma well.

309
00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:51,570
Individuals have and manage asthma well. Society has managed asthma, like other important outcomes are also symptom reductions,

310
00:40:52,260 --> 00:41:01,200
which often come a little bit closer to the point where, you know, possibility as a proxy for improved disease control.

311
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:12,930
So steps to developing a conceptual model. And these are just steps you guys are going to go through over a period of weeks.

312
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:16,559
So you're going to identify an important outcome that's related to this problem.

313
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:23,330
You identified that your focus. You want to then identify factors that influence the outcomes.

314
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:27,260
You want to work a little bit backwards and you want to think about existing research,

315
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:33,260
personal knowledge and experience that you can put some sort of evidence behind.

316
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:37,459
And you want to think about the different theories that we cover in this class.

317
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:40,830
And, you know, you're not married to the theories we cover in this class.

318
00:41:40,850 --> 00:41:47,600
And even other theories that we may not have a chance to cover them may be very relevant to the issue that you're.

319
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:54,810
Now we want to specify the relationship. So you want to draw arrows among the identified factors.

320
00:41:55,230 --> 00:41:59,850
And again, you want to use existing research, existing conceptual models, theories,

321
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:05,600
personal knowledge, experience and intuition to explain those different techniques.

322
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:16,709
Then you want to review the model and begin narrowing that focus because models should be detailed and comprehensive,

323
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:26,650
but also parsimonious at the same time. Typically you can't address every aspect of a problem.

324
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:30,700
You really want to dwindle down to what's really most important.

325
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:40,330
What can you realistically expect to accomplish? And the model in general should be limited to those aspects of the problem that

326
00:42:40,330 --> 00:42:47,220
are addressed in your study or intervention or a specified program of use.

327
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:54,340
So again, going back to the example of actually you're not going to have a conceptual model

328
00:42:54,340 --> 00:43:00,050
around as much is going to be an element of that focus applied to the outcome.

329
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:06,400
Again, helping you narrow population that and a specific problem in that larger area

330
00:43:07,270 --> 00:43:13,390
that you would want to detail out and model development in general is not easy.

331
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:18,340
It will involve several, if not many, attempts before you arrive at your final model.

332
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:33,110
So how do you know where to put the arrows? Use the following guide in terms of where your arrows go.

333
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:36,590
So your theory, previous research and your hypotheses.

334
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:42,590
Be sure the arrows in your model are justifiable and the constructs and variables in your model.

335
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:52,200
These are things you can actually measure. So let me give you an example of my own conceptual model journey.

336
00:43:52,230 --> 00:44:03,770
So when I was a PhD student, one of the things that we had to do in order to progress through our degree is to take a

337
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:09,780
preliminary exam where we specify a conceptual model and demonstrate our ability to do so.

338
00:44:10,950 --> 00:44:24,660
And when I was doing my page C, I was very interested in why providers and patients don't talk about the costs of illness,

339
00:44:25,170 --> 00:44:29,570
of managing chronic disease and out-of-pocket costs burden.

340
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:35,790
So why are health care providers and patients talking about this more routine?

341
00:44:35,970 --> 00:44:45,720
So that was the question I was interested in. That was a focus of my preliminary exam work and my dissertation work as well.

342
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:50,880
So I came up with a conceptual model around this.

343
00:44:53,570 --> 00:45:03,140
So I use social cognitive theory as a guide to my conceptual model, and we'll be talking about social cognitive theory in a few weeks.

344
00:45:03,710 --> 00:45:06,770
But essentially it's thinking about social.

345
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:17,540
Cognitive theory is really about the environment, behavioral factors and are personal factors interacting with each other to drive behavior.

346
00:45:17,930 --> 00:45:20,260
That's really the essence of social cognitive theories.

347
00:45:20,270 --> 00:45:27,420
I was thinking about this from the perspective of a patient and I was thinking about it from the perspective of the health care providers.

348
00:45:27,450 --> 00:45:32,960
Now, that's sort of my underlying theory that I was interested in understanding this issue.

349
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:39,450
And then I was also interested in the Anderson model and health care utilization,

350
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:47,730
which really tries to predict, you know, why people use health services.

351
00:45:48,330 --> 00:45:52,680
And it's really a combination of behavior and personal choice,

352
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:59,730
the characteristics of the population and the environment of the external environment, and how it interacts with the health care system.

353
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:06,930
So thinking about the social cognitive theory and the Anderson's model of health care utilization to inform this problem,

354
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:14,430
I was interested in why patients and providers don't talk about out-of-pocket costs of care.

355
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:25,190
So this is where I started with Draft one. I just I was thinking about patient health outcomes.

356
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:33,510
I didn't really define my outcomes quite yet. I just sort of threw a box down and threw down some factors that.

357
00:46:35,810 --> 00:46:39,240
This are related to this problem in some way.

358
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:48,990
As you can see, there is a health care provider and the patient is interested in communication, how it led to disease management and outcomes,

359
00:46:48,990 --> 00:46:55,890
and then just sort of did a brain dump of different things that might influence that relationship.

360
00:46:56,580 --> 00:47:01,830
So as you can see, this doesn't really make a lot of sense if you look at it.

361
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:06,710
I. This is a very coherent draft one.

362
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:15,490
So then my mentor, I gave it to her and she looked at it and we were sitting across from each other

363
00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:21,549
and she just looked at it and then just passed it back without saying anything.

364
00:47:21,550 --> 00:47:30,490
And that means you need to start again. And so she passed it back to me and I tried again and I came up with this.

365
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:40,960
So a little more, you know, working my way through it, thinking about, you know, cause this,

366
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:49,390
this idea of cost related communication, this communication about cost and the things that might influence that communication.

367
00:47:49,390 --> 00:48:01,600
So here I have more information, contextual factors and provider contextual factors and then have included that, you know, as an antecedent.

368
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:08,920
A patient has to face some sort of financial pressure for that communication being possible.

369
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:23,580
So thinking about that, it. And so then I got some feedback from my mentor and then continued to model drive three units looking a little different.

370
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:33,270
I've added more things in here. And also, if you look at the left side thinking through those mechanisms in a lot of detail,

371
00:48:34,110 --> 00:48:38,790
as you you may have recalled in the first draft, all I had was patient health outcomes.

372
00:48:39,210 --> 00:48:40,890
It's like really nonspecific.

373
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:49,800
But here I sort of thought through a little more what are those different distal and proximal outcomes that might be relevant?

374
00:48:51,570 --> 00:49:03,030
So I got more feedback, added a lot more arrows as I was going through research and thinking about how different things relate to one another.

375
00:49:05,470 --> 00:49:13,660
Then I decided to retire my pen and paper and catch up with technology and

376
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:18,860
actually use PowerPoint to make this a little more clear as I put it through.

377
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:25,990
So we're on draft six. Seven.

378
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:34,730
It's looking a little bit cleaner. Draft eight.

379
00:49:44,340 --> 00:50:01,159
14. And here I am, parent and child, because at that point I was using a data set to inform the actual test,

380
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:03,620
being able to test some of these relationships.

381
00:50:04,130 --> 00:50:21,530
My data set was a parent child situation as part of the patient, part of the mix of this issue and then drive 17, just 19.

382
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:36,360
Funny. And then here I decided to switch the data I was working with.

383
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:47,370
So go back to just patients because it was a specific data set with African-American women, then dropped 21.

384
00:50:52,910 --> 00:50:58,130
So this was just one. 20.

385
00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:03,219
So clearly I was obsessive. It took me again.

386
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:10,720
This was through my teenage days. So Wednesday is actually 21 drives and thinking through these relationships took me a few years.

387
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:23,900
You have 14 weeks. You have you have multiple brains to utilize in your group.

388
00:51:23,930 --> 00:51:27,950
So I'm confident you're going to get there.

389
00:51:29,090 --> 00:51:34,800
So it is it is a lot of work. And you just wanted to show you this, to show you how it could evolve.

390
00:51:34,870 --> 00:51:43,729
Like you can just like I really encourage you to just throw something on paper and then work your way through refining it.

391
00:51:43,730 --> 00:51:51,200
So you get to hopefully something like this, maybe something a little bit less complicated this.

392
00:51:56,180 --> 00:52:11,180
Any questions? Then here's a cleaner one.

393
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:17,740
I think I did this. Two years after I finished my PhD.

394
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:23,020
You needed a break from all those drafts and screened myself a little more.

395
00:52:32,610 --> 00:52:36,810
So here's another one, just to give you an example. So that was the one I had created.

396
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:45,360
Here's another one really asking the question Why don't physicians follow clinical practice guidelines?

397
00:52:45,390 --> 00:52:49,709
This was from like 1999,

398
00:52:49,710 --> 00:53:03,540
a very important question that fine a lot of clinical guideline work is an intervention strategy to support the uptake of clinical guidelines.

399
00:53:04,050 --> 00:53:09,320
So in this model and so it's telling us that there.

400
00:53:11,330 --> 00:53:20,659
Several principle sort of behavioral constructs that influence this behavior of not following guidelines,

401
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:24,110
including external barriers, guidelines, factors,

402
00:53:24,110 --> 00:53:25,429
environmental factors,

403
00:53:25,430 --> 00:53:36,110
but also people's attitudes and knowledge being some of the primary reasons why we don't see uptake of guidelines as much as we would like.

404
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:50,110
This is a conceptual model from our chair of our department, Dr. Cleo Caldwell.

405
00:53:51,310 --> 00:54:02,469
She, for most of her career, has focused on an intervention model that engages fathers and sons in the context of

406
00:54:02,470 --> 00:54:12,910
adolescent development to reduce substance use and initiation and early sexual initiation.

407
00:54:12,910 --> 00:54:21,070
And the promise is really that nonresident fathers are more involved in their sons life in various ways,

408
00:54:21,090 --> 00:54:24,700
then those sorts of outcomes can be mitigated.

409
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:32,050
So this is a conceptual model she had put together, and that isn't it.

410
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:40,850
It's a conceptual model that informs her intervention, that really draws on what sort of theories we've talked about.

411
00:54:40,870 --> 00:54:45,340
Do you see evidence in this framework that she has put together?

412
00:54:57,110 --> 00:55:02,630
Yeah. Self-efficacy like the hope. Okay, so you see some health belief model in here.

413
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:07,430
Okay. What else is the theory of plane behavior?

414
00:55:07,430 --> 00:55:13,760
The one with attitudes? Yeah. So theory of recent action plan behavior, we see a little bit of that in there.

415
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:21,170
We see a little social, ecological approach thinking about social networks and social supports.

416
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:29,090
So again, you see some of those relationships being pulled out.

417
00:55:29,090 --> 00:55:37,969
And this it's not a direct sort of copy of the theory of reasoned action in terms of taking that framework and plugging in this problem.

418
00:55:37,970 --> 00:55:53,030
But you see elements of it coming together to really show the different factors that might impact Father-Son relationships in order

419
00:55:53,030 --> 00:56:03,470
to inform an intervention around fostering more closeness with those relationships to mitigate some of these adverse outcomes.

420
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:12,860
There's another one from the literature and I pulled these out directly from published papers.

421
00:56:12,860 --> 00:56:19,970
So this one is environmental determinants of walking and cycling.

422
00:56:20,390 --> 00:56:28,070
So things that might influence our ability to walk or bike to school.

423
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:35,870
And behavioral intention, again, that comes from theory of reasoned action and plan behavior.

424
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:43,070
It appears to be more of an intentional behavior, something we think about under volitional control.

425
00:56:43,430 --> 00:56:47,570
So that sort of theory makes sense to use in this context.

426
00:56:48,050 --> 00:56:55,370
And this model is sort of telling us that there are individual factors and social and environmental factors that might

427
00:56:56,750 --> 00:57:03,200
and very much specified things that might influence our being a real intention around walking or commuting to school.

428
00:57:09,070 --> 00:57:16,270
There's another one around psychosocial risk and protective factors for excessive gestational weight gain.

429
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:20,870
So very outcome of interest is gestational weight gain.

430
00:57:22,030 --> 00:57:29,080
And thinking about maternal behaviors in this context, what are some factors that may lead to that?

431
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:33,609
More proximal is physical activity, eating behaviors.

432
00:57:33,610 --> 00:57:40,479
And then what you see more on the left side is a combination of contextual factors

433
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:47,020
related to the family and individual factors that might influence coping skills,

434
00:57:47,020 --> 00:57:51,340
motivation, efficacy, all the things we're going to talk about in the next period.

435
00:57:57,220 --> 00:58:02,620
So what's nice about this model is it sort of also buckets the different factors.

436
00:58:03,070 --> 00:58:11,470
So it's sort of cool that you sort of clearly see, are we talking about the mother here or are these behavioral factors?

437
00:58:12,130 --> 00:58:15,850
You know, what would sort of category might they be?

438
00:58:21,860 --> 00:58:27,200
Here's another one. Thinking about caring for an adolescent. So is the one I showed you that I had made.

439
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:34,430
I had started two parties, the patient and the provider, relevant to that communication relationship.

440
00:58:34,970 --> 00:58:47,750
This is also a communication relationship between two parties and their various behaviors that might influence the outcomes of an adolescent,

441
00:58:47,750 --> 00:58:54,680
but having to think about the parents factors and influencing that relationship and those behaviors.

442
00:58:55,040 --> 00:59:05,150
So you want to this is an interesting sort of depiction of being able to put both of those perspectives in the same body.

443
00:59:05,660 --> 00:59:11,719
Sometimes, visually, it's a little hard to incorporate two sort of perspectives,

444
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:16,430
but I thought this model did a good job with that while looking pretty personal as well.

445
00:59:24,890 --> 00:59:29,060
So when we think about building models, where are these order of the stops?

446
00:59:29,540 --> 00:59:35,149
What are you going to do? You're going to have you'll probably maybe some of you have already started, but you have.

447
00:59:35,150 --> 00:59:40,190
And you're going to do this. Really? Where should we start?

448
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:45,950
Oh, Trump Trust. Specify the outcome of interest.

449
00:59:45,990 --> 01:00:01,280
Then what? So that a little select correlates of the outcomes like better correlates of an outcome.

450
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:09,710
Okay. How about using an existing model as a starting point?

451
01:00:11,380 --> 01:00:29,650
At least if one. There is.

452
01:00:33,340 --> 01:00:36,250
So you want to start with specifying your outcome of interests.

453
01:00:37,950 --> 01:00:43,839
So you'd want to use an existing model as a starting point before you select your potential car.

454
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:49,200
Let's have an outcome that may help you start to think about some potential performance.

455
01:00:49,390 --> 01:00:54,280
Thinking about using an existing model for a few models as a starting point.

456
01:00:56,170 --> 01:00:59,260
Then you want to select your potential correlates of the outcome.

457
01:00:59,260 --> 01:01:03,040
So I think two and three sort of go in tandem with each other,

458
01:01:03,730 --> 01:01:12,070
and then you want to determine the initial relationship, some of the different concepts, and then draw some linkages.

459
01:01:12,790 --> 01:01:20,500
So four and five, you'll probably iterate through many, many steps that sort of gives you the different steps to.

460
01:01:25,980 --> 01:01:29,940
So any questions about building conceptual models?

461
01:01:33,150 --> 01:01:40,290
Could you go back to the letter in the box. So I know a is the predictor is outcome the is a confounder.

462
01:01:40,290 --> 01:01:44,310
I kind of just get mixed up with the moderator media. Sure.

463
01:01:52,320 --> 01:02:05,030
The moderators. The moderators invited me here. Oh.

464
01:02:10,420 --> 01:02:18,280
Yeah. When you're building conceptual models, is it I imagine you build it before you write.

465
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:24,820
But then when we're going over to your drafts, you changed from parent and child to general patients.

466
01:02:26,410 --> 01:02:31,960
So you're always consider slightly changing your conceptual model as you go through a research as well.

467
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:36,580
Or do you have a model set before you design or research?

468
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:46,690
You should have a model set before you design your research. And I had to change things before I even went into those data sets like I had.

469
01:02:46,810 --> 01:02:51,219
I knew I had those data available to me. So based on I don't understand.

470
01:02:51,220 --> 01:02:55,480
Okay, what what is the population those data were collected on?

471
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:58,960
What what information do I have available to me?

472
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:07,300
Because there was a secondary data analysis, so I knew that. But before I even went in and did any sort of analysis or.

473
01:03:09,100 --> 01:03:12,430
You know, generated any sort of hypothesis.

474
01:03:12,910 --> 01:03:19,330
I had to work through that model to really understand those relationships before I went into the data.

475
01:03:20,050 --> 01:03:30,120
But in that situation, using that very data, I did have to understand the problem and.

476
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:40,150
So in terms of like changing your model before you like as you're doing your intervention along the way.

477
01:03:44,650 --> 01:03:49,860
I mean, I think if we're testing out, this is like does this intervention work?

478
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:55,300
I know that's not good practice, but maybe once around you did a pilot.

479
01:03:56,800 --> 01:04:02,709
You understood the problem, you decided intervention to inform that did more by that conceptual model.

480
01:04:02,710 --> 01:04:08,110
You do a pilot on a small group of people and from that pilot you learn some things.

481
01:04:08,470 --> 01:04:11,260
Maybe some things are related in the way you thought they were.

482
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:20,350
You make some changes and then embark on a bigger investigation with those refined relationships.

483
01:04:29,730 --> 01:04:34,950
Okay. So after class, I'm going to impose these updated slides.

484
01:04:35,490 --> 01:04:46,770
That's up to you to go through some of these examples and have them available to you as you guys start to embark on your semester long project.

485
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:59,070
On Wednesday, we're going to be talking about how for a behavior change and this is like very much like comes from psychology.

486
01:04:59,340 --> 01:05:03,150
It's sort of the root of individual behavior.

487
01:05:04,230 --> 01:05:14,100
And I think it's important to understand because as you sort of think about behavior change,

488
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:22,320
understanding like the core of where behavior change came from in psychology is really important.

489
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:27,479
And we're going to go through an example of how this core is applied to a public

490
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:34,170
health issue and then just have a little discussion around some of the relevance,

491
01:05:34,170 --> 01:05:36,569
but also limitations of that approach.

492
01:05:36,570 --> 01:05:48,330
So we're going to get into probably the last piece of individual behavior change and then core origins one on 109.

493
01:05:48,690 --> 01:05:51,870
So there are several readings around it and some optional ones.

494
01:05:51,870 --> 01:05:55,710
So if it's interesting to you, feel free to also dove into some of the options.

495
01:06:00,300 --> 01:06:04,470
Okay, so that's it for today and I'll see you guys on Wednesday.

496
01:06:08,890 --> 01:06:20,130
I she's going to have much more on.

497
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:38,310
Just three. You know, I think we have been doing the right thing.

498
01:06:39,330 --> 01:07:05,819
But how can you say you're 69, 37 years old and in crisis out there?

499
01:07:05,820 --> 01:07:26,870
And I think the difference has to 69 minutes or so, but like a third floor figure, let's get this class in early so I can figure it out.

500
01:07:27,750 --> 01:07:45,250
I love to know what Rubio's like as that goes.

501
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:50,100
I think it's a great team sports.

502
01:07:50,130 --> 01:08:01,280
And like I said, it is like I was not it's like I don't know.

503
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:09,000
It was like, yeah, if people are out, I don't know.

504
01:08:09,220 --> 01:08:13,290
I was kind of surprised. They were like, Yeah, you know? And I was like, Yeah.

505
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:18,630
So you got not go to the top.

506
01:08:21,260 --> 01:08:27,680
And I was like, Oh my gosh.

507
01:08:29,090 --> 01:08:43,190
You know, I didn't realize it was really like, yes.

508
01:08:43,210 --> 01:08:53,650
I was like, That's right. I was like, Yeah, I think so.

509
01:08:54,840 --> 01:09:02,390
You know? So I think it's like you're really ordered it.

510
01:09:03,130 --> 01:09:25,830
I was like, this situation says, Yeah, you know, I can help you out, and I think you can make things worse.

511
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:38,830
So you're also. Okay.

512
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:44,380
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

513
01:09:45,730 --> 01:09:55,270
I'm so sorry. We can't make it work.

514
01:09:55,270 --> 01:10:06,190
Distribution. It's like it's hard to be good.

515
01:10:10,450 --> 01:10:13,159
Maybe in that part if we just add on the groceries.

516
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:20,020
He was a kid since we already wrote like we're going to play to our strengths and make sure that like all friends are covered.

517
01:10:20,020 --> 01:10:23,110
So maybe if we just. I'm sorry. Yeah, I will tell you.

518
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:26,650
Yeah. Just list out, like, individually. What's your strengths?

519
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:31,540
Okay. Is that the main thing you want us to focus or put more detail in?

520
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:36,660
Like in general, but I guess like to strategize theoretically.

521
01:10:36,670 --> 01:10:41,799
What would you do? Took the last part of all other groups.

522
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:47,320
They just listed out each one, like everybody listed in that for that one.

523
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:51,219
That's really going okay. Okay. Sounds good. So here we go.

524
01:10:51,220 --> 01:10:57,690
We go. Just really curious.

525
01:10:57,910 --> 01:11:04,130
So see, that kind of happened later.

526
01:11:05,620 --> 01:11:12,720
Yeah. I mean, we all have this is a yeah, we all have some stock so we can go back on it later to engage.

527
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:29,590
And it's about like how I think we should be like, you know, we do not roll often.

528
01:11:29,590 --> 01:11:34,450
Do you think like so when we're talking about how often we should meet, what do you think?

529
01:11:34,450 --> 01:11:38,020
Like what do groups usually do? Like do they need to meet every single week?

530
01:11:39,020 --> 01:11:42,910
This product usually I think is wrong. Put it like check them weekly.

531
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:47,109
So we are like, if you don't have to meet, you can still just check it.

532
01:11:47,110 --> 01:11:58,509
But yeah, okay. Okay, yeah. So if we want to have like weekly check ins, we can find the time we can reserve on like 85 minutes.

533
01:11:58,510 --> 01:12:07,330
148 okay. Yeah, maybe just like week by week, we'll check in and see if we want to do,

534
01:12:07,510 --> 01:12:13,870
like in-person group meetings or like over Zoom or if we want to set with a deadline.

535
01:12:14,380 --> 01:12:23,140
Like maybe if we don't necessarily need to meet in person, but we are like we have whatever to get it done to make sure it is done actually.

536
01:12:27,460 --> 01:12:32,580
Yeah. The Emperors updates and, like, just making sure you know anything.

537
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:37,360
Okay, see you guys later. But let me ask you, do you think that Julie yet email or anything?

538
01:12:37,550 --> 01:12:51,760
I think you. To.

539
01:12:53,010 --> 01:13:01,590
We're talking about. You mean like in terms of demanding of the work just be like.

540
01:13:02,660 --> 01:13:06,830
Everyone present ideas for each part and we might talk about them.

541
01:13:07,670 --> 01:13:13,590
Everyone brings an outcome. They're interested in trying to find similarities or isn't.

542
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:29,060
Maybe for group process goals we see like identify at least four tests so we have something to do per week.

543
01:13:29,190 --> 01:13:33,750
Yeah. True. Part of like weekly check ins. Can you be here?

544
01:13:34,290 --> 01:13:39,990
Just working documented like the weekly check ins.

545
01:13:40,380 --> 01:13:48,660
We have, like a weekly like to do list of like what? Like the stuff for the project that we want to have done that we, like, decide meeting time.

546
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:53,680
Yeah. So.

547
01:13:54,670 --> 01:14:00,140
So usually. So it is Wednesdays after this class.

548
01:14:00,190 --> 01:14:04,700
Usually when you guys seem to be free. I have class at 230.

549
01:14:04,900 --> 01:14:06,710
But we're going to end early. That can stay like this.

550
01:14:07,190 --> 01:14:15,110
On Mondays and Wednesdays, your question really gets okay, because this is my last class, the day on Mondays and Wednesdays.

551
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:21,110
So after that I'm afraid of getting tired. So this is my last class on Wednesday, but I do class right after.

552
01:14:21,170 --> 01:14:25,660
Do you have another class on Wednesdays?

553
01:14:25,670 --> 01:14:31,940
Yes. What is the class, AJ? Okay, so the one that goes till it's 530.

554
01:14:32,150 --> 01:14:35,600
Okay, so maybe like Wednesday evenings might be like a good time.

555
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:40,250
Yeah. Do you have to with your work schedule, does that seem like that would be.

556
01:14:40,280 --> 01:14:46,210
I think so. Okay. We can try to like say Wednesday evenings right now, but obviously, you know,

557
01:14:46,250 --> 01:14:53,930
it's a week by week saying like if that doesn't work or something, that can just be kind of what we're thinking right now.

558
01:15:05,670 --> 01:15:08,930
I think that seems good if we all just go in and out our. Yeah.

559
01:15:09,090 --> 01:15:16,930
Since we. But you should be able to believe they would say, well, that's really.

560
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:42,540
You see, it's one thing that at all.

561
01:15:43,070 --> 01:15:45,270
I guess I'm just like, I don't really know.

562
01:15:45,650 --> 01:15:54,740
I mean, it's the only disagreements we would have would really be about like even like you and I can submit together.

563
01:15:54,780 --> 01:16:00,090
Yeah. It's just like if we just, like. Just like talking things through.

564
01:16:00,210 --> 01:16:04,920
Yeah. You know, like, say we create, like, a voting system so we can vote on it.

565
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:08,700
You bring up a topic. True. Or something like that.

566
01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:14,880
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Just like, um. Like group consensus on.

567
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:21,210
Yeah. But it works. And also, like, I guess I just want a preference.

568
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:29,430
Like, I'm never going to be offended if we're doing something and we are like, and people vote against like my ideas, I don't care.

569
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:35,910
And I'm sure most people pretty like, you know, like, I'm not going to take anything personally.

570
01:16:36,270 --> 01:16:39,480
Yeah. If anything comes up, you know, it's all just about.

571
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:45,390
Yeah. Academics, you know? I mean, I don't.

572
01:16:45,610 --> 01:16:48,870
I mean, obviously it's been horrible.

573
01:16:49,140 --> 01:16:52,530
I mean, people all, you know, like, that's different, obviously.

574
01:16:52,530 --> 01:16:58,470
But like, you know, disagreements will be like, aimed at anyone's character.

575
01:16:59,640 --> 01:17:08,690
You know, it's all just about. I didn't think they would hurt you when you see that.

576
01:17:08,940 --> 01:17:12,280
Well, but in terms of relations, you do this.

577
01:17:12,650 --> 01:17:16,370
Oh, we say like you were talking a week before. Yeah.

578
01:17:16,390 --> 01:17:24,530
So maybe if we just try to say like weekly champions on Wednesdays and then that will determine if we meet in person that in the night.

579
01:17:25,190 --> 01:17:31,740
Yeah. So being open to like sketching another. Yeah.

580
01:17:32,210 --> 01:17:35,240
And that can also even just feeling a cliché.

581
01:17:36,170 --> 01:17:43,710
Yeah. Could just be I'm like you need to do something over Zoom like you don't have to necessarily all come back to campus.

582
01:17:44,870 --> 01:17:51,229
Just like I usually like to either like stay on campus for a bit after classes or

583
01:17:51,230 --> 01:17:56,059
come back since I was like not super hard because I'd keep focus at my apartment.

584
01:17:56,060 --> 01:18:01,010
So, I mean, I can't come to campus almost every day, just on Saturdays.

585
01:18:01,310 --> 01:18:09,530
So we went to me for, like, truly availability.

586
01:18:09,950 --> 01:18:16,840
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. So you can, like, record of trying to get right.

587
01:18:18,770 --> 01:18:28,630
Do we want to. Like where you work for money?

588
01:18:28,670 --> 01:18:33,250
Yeah. What we do is that we create a folder, and here it is.

589
01:18:33,580 --> 01:18:36,830
Oh, yeah. Providing feedback to each other. Yeah.

590
01:18:37,140 --> 01:18:43,280
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, like, if we do divvy up assignments, we can also, like,

591
01:18:43,300 --> 01:18:52,060
we can provide feedback that's going to help us keep everything organized and all together.

592
01:18:52,060 --> 01:19:00,770
And also then like, if it's all in Google Docs, then we're all able to also look at like, did this like what did this person say in this book?

593
01:19:00,890 --> 01:19:05,560
Then I can put this in my section. Then we all just already have access to everyone's work.

594
01:19:06,330 --> 01:19:10,510
So it's so easy access.

595
01:19:10,870 --> 01:19:24,449
Right. I don't think class or busy. Yeah. Yeah. I think that which is often interesting to me that this is, I guess, one, change,

596
01:19:24,450 --> 01:19:34,050
the date change or whatever, and I should be able to do this getting lunch, but then I can go in.

597
01:19:35,370 --> 01:19:42,780
So I guess we just text in the group after we've looked over it and added anything like this evening.

598
01:19:43,420 --> 01:19:47,249
So that was good on my like assignments.

599
01:19:47,250 --> 01:19:53,459
It's like missing group contracts. Like, I wish they would just like, I mean, maybe once we resubmit, they still do that.

600
01:19:53,460 --> 01:19:56,720
But it's like. Makes me think about that.

601
01:19:57,540 --> 01:20:06,800
Yeah. Excuse me again. Missing assignment. Yeah, that's insane.

602
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:11,450
Yeah. I mean, this conference seems like it's going to get out really a lot.

603
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:16,040
Maybe that's just the beginning of the semester thing. Like, she kind of goes fast.

604
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:21,960
Students get criticized, I think have those built in group days or like for like group projects.

605
01:20:22,140 --> 01:20:26,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

606
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:33,470
That'll that'll also make it a lot easier because then we might not even need to meet that week because we had class time.

607
01:20:33,660 --> 01:20:36,680
So sweet like.

608
01:20:53,980 --> 01:20:59,930
When do we actually have to start submitting this, like in these two weeks?

609
01:20:59,960 --> 01:21:03,230
I think it was I think something on the 30th.

610
01:21:03,260 --> 01:21:09,130
This idea. Oh, yeah. Okay. Thank you.
