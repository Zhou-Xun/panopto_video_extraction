1
00:00:01,293 --> 00:00:09,903
Okay, so let me resume. Lives look great.

2
00:00:11,283 --> 00:00:18,123
All right. We're going to get started. Thank you, everybody.

3
00:00:18,443 --> 00:00:26,823
I try not to steal your water. Thank you very much. So it is my pleasure to introduce Dr. Natasha back to Syria.

4
00:00:27,543 --> 00:00:33,213
Dr. Bassiouni has been the chief medical executive for the State of Michigan since 2021.

5
00:00:33,603 --> 00:00:38,793
In this role, she provides overall medical guidance for the state of Michigan as a cabinet member for the governor.

6
00:00:39,363 --> 00:00:44,733
She is board certified by the American Board of Internal Medicine in internal medicine and Infectious Diseases.

7
00:00:44,733 --> 00:00:47,463
And she she's a fellow of the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

8
00:00:50,253 --> 00:00:55,893
She has worked in Michigan and internationally in Singapore, Bangladesh and for the World Health Organization.

9
00:00:56,253 --> 00:01:03,573
She has over 50 publications on topics in infectious diseases and public health of great relevance to today.

10
00:01:03,603 --> 00:01:08,193
Dr. Vegetarian completed medical school at Wayne State University and Internal

11
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:12,093
Medicine Residency and Infectious Disease Fellowship at the University of Michigan.

12
00:01:12,423 --> 00:01:19,533
And she received a master's of public health degree from the Jimmy Program from the University of Michigan in 2001.

13
00:01:19,923 --> 00:01:23,913
We suspect that actually this Tushnet took a class together at one point, but we don't remember.

14
00:01:25,863 --> 00:01:32,583
So without further ado, I'm going to turn it over to Natasha, Dr. Baxter, to talk.

15
00:01:32,583 --> 00:01:38,403
She's going to give kind of a career talk in terms of her experience, the different experiences she's had in her career.

16
00:01:38,703 --> 00:01:42,093
But, you know, she has. This isn't in your bio. I'm just going to add stuff.

17
00:01:42,753 --> 00:01:48,093
Yes. She's done a lot of work in hospital epidemiology and infection prevention spaces,

18
00:01:48,423 --> 00:01:55,862
both from a very hospital based practice perspective, but then also from a policymaking perspective at W.H.O. and then at the state.

19
00:01:55,863 --> 00:01:59,253
And so this is kind of a thread that she's had throughout.

20
00:01:59,253 --> 00:02:04,323
And so I think she'd be a great person to ask her questions about it in terms of careers and directions.

21
00:02:05,153 --> 00:02:08,913
With that. Thank you so much.

22
00:02:08,943 --> 00:02:15,663
Can everyone hear me okay? Okay. I'm going to try to make this quick and painless for you all.

23
00:02:16,713 --> 00:02:22,233
I was asked to start out with some slides and I really wasn't sure how to make slides about my career.

24
00:02:23,223 --> 00:02:33,633
So I thought that I could just share some publications because the publication sort of tell a story of what I've worked on through my career.

25
00:02:34,263 --> 00:02:42,483
Dr. Martin told you a little bit about my early career, so my training, my infectious disease, internal medicine and HIV training.

26
00:02:43,923 --> 00:02:51,213
But I'll just take you through my post-graduate career and what I did after I finished all of that training.

27
00:02:51,573 --> 00:02:59,193
So I finished my infectious disease fellowship in 2010, and I after fellowship,

28
00:02:59,523 --> 00:03:05,373
I really wanted to work in hospital and molecular epidemiology as a hospital epidemiologist.

29
00:03:05,733 --> 00:03:10,113
And so I really worked on things that were interesting to me at the time.

30
00:03:11,133 --> 00:03:14,883
And I was really interested in device associated infections.

31
00:03:15,213 --> 00:03:19,983
I was interested in C diff. And so I thought I was going to go on to have a career and see death.

32
00:03:21,003 --> 00:03:25,052
And so you can see the publications that I worked on right after I finished my

33
00:03:25,053 --> 00:03:29,583
training were all sort of what was happening in hospital epidemiology at that time.

34
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:38,253
So device infections and we were just seeing see cases really spike across the country and people were dying from C diff.

35
00:03:38,253 --> 00:03:44,612
And so hospital epidemiologist had a whole lot of attention, which was something brand new and was very exciting.

36
00:03:44,613 --> 00:03:58,173
And I didn't think that epidemiology would ever gain that kind of attention again, which, as you know, is is not what happened from 2015 onwards.

37
00:03:59,133 --> 00:04:06,872
So from 2010 to 2015, I was working in the state and I was working as a hospital epidemiologist at a few different hospitals in the state,

38
00:04:06,873 --> 00:04:14,463
including U of M and the Ann Arbor VA. And just sort of writing what I thought was interesting and working on hospital policies at those places.

39
00:04:14,793 --> 00:04:24,663
And then in 2015, I decided that I had really had enough with with clinical medicine here and the types of jobs that I was getting here.

40
00:04:25,233 --> 00:04:29,283
It was very hard to find a job as an ID physician solely.

41
00:04:29,973 --> 00:04:33,243
You were being sort of stretched and pulled in a lot of different directions.

42
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:36,213
You were being asked to see more and more patients.

43
00:04:36,213 --> 00:04:42,243
You were being given very little time to do other things outside of patient care, such as infection control.

44
00:04:42,723 --> 00:04:49,473
And I ended up moving to Singapore. And the way that it happened was my husband was offered a job in Singapore.

45
00:04:49,863 --> 00:04:53,192
And I thought once I moved, I would never be able to work again.

46
00:04:53,193 --> 00:04:58,413
And I thought this was the end of my career and I was just sort of heading out into the unknown and we're going to see what happened.

47
00:04:59,493 --> 00:05:05,133
It's also very hard for physicians who trained in the U.S. to work in countries like Singapore.

48
00:05:05,373 --> 00:05:14,073
They do not, by and large, recognize our training. So I moved to Singapore in in 2015, and I stayed at home.

49
00:05:14,073 --> 00:05:18,093
I had a I had a newborn. I stayed at home for about six months.

50
00:05:18,093 --> 00:05:22,112
And I thought, gosh, this is really hard. I really don't like staying at home.

51
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:22,953
I need a job.

52
00:05:23,373 --> 00:05:33,272
And I ended up finding and this is just through talking to people and going out and sort of cold calling and interviewing with random people.

53
00:05:33,273 --> 00:05:40,083
I ended up finding my dream job in Singapore. So I found a hospital called the National University of Singapore.

54
00:05:41,043 --> 00:05:49,743
The main hospital is about 2000 beds, so about double the size of U of M and they also had a number of other affiliated hospitals.

55
00:05:49,743 --> 00:05:55,593
So altogether, this is a massive hospital system and they did really great care.

56
00:05:55,593 --> 00:06:00,273
They provided really, really state of the art care for very low costs.

57
00:06:00,933 --> 00:06:06,783
They also weren't seeing the same types of hospital associated infections that we were seeing here in the US.

58
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:14,613
They really did not have a problem with see death. Patients don't really get seated there and if they do, they're not incredibly sick from it.

59
00:06:15,273 --> 00:06:19,233
And some of this has to do with maybe different circulating strains in different parts of the world.

60
00:06:19,593 --> 00:06:31,142
But I got involved. So in in this job, they were really looking for someone with infection control training and antimicrobial stewardship,

61
00:06:31,143 --> 00:06:35,733
which is all I had ever wanted to do. So they found a way to get my training recognized.

62
00:06:35,733 --> 00:06:38,133
And I worked at this amazing hospital for five years.

63
00:06:38,403 --> 00:06:46,083
And so you can see from the publications during these five years I worked on, I worked on projects related to antimicrobial stewardship.

64
00:06:46,383 --> 00:06:50,403
I worked on outbreaks.

65
00:06:50,403 --> 00:06:55,203
So I managed big outbreaks of disease. Big exposures.

66
00:06:55,473 --> 00:07:01,533
One of the one of the. Or two of these publications are on.

67
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:12,733
TB exposure. We had a massive TB exposure where a pediatric nurse had TB and walked around

68
00:07:12,733 --> 00:07:18,553
coughing on neonates and babies for about three months with active pulmonary TB.

69
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:24,313
And so I did a lot of work on TB and got quite a few publications out of that.

70
00:07:24,883 --> 00:07:28,213
But really, again, just working on things that I thought was interesting.

71
00:07:29,473 --> 00:07:34,973
And then of course, in 2019, COVID hit.

72
00:07:34,993 --> 00:07:41,023
So right around New Year's Eve on 2019, I was on a lot of listservs.

73
00:07:41,263 --> 00:07:48,763
And on New Year's Eve, we heard that there was there were some atypical pneumonia in Wuhan, China, and that we should be aware of this.

74
00:07:49,003 --> 00:08:00,403
Now, I think a lot of my colleagues in the U.S. weren't quite as attuned to the way we were attuned in Singapore because Singapore had seen SA as one.

75
00:08:00,853 --> 00:08:07,873
So Singapore had not only dealt with the first stars, but people had died from SA's in the hospital where I worked.

76
00:08:08,173 --> 00:08:15,973
And so they had this institutional knowledge. And not only was it this sort of abstract concept, they knew people who had died.

77
00:08:16,573 --> 00:08:21,433
And so they took this really seriously, I think, a little bit differently than some of my colleagues here did.

78
00:08:21,763 --> 00:08:23,502
I was staying in touch at this time,

79
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:31,632
and I was calling some of my friends back in the U.S. who work in infection prevention and saying there is this new disease coming, are you ready?

80
00:08:31,633 --> 00:08:35,263
And they were like, Oh, yeah, we're totally ready. And they were not.

81
00:08:35,803 --> 00:08:43,753
So in January of 2020, the part I left out, by the way, was in 20.

82
00:08:44,803 --> 00:08:51,193
18. My husband took a job in Dubai and that meant leaving Singapore.

83
00:08:51,223 --> 00:08:54,282
I really did not want to give up my job in Singapore.

84
00:08:54,283 --> 00:09:03,673
And so I created a work plan and an offer on how they could continue to keep me and how they could have me work for them,

85
00:09:04,093 --> 00:09:10,662
even though I lived in Dubai. And so we worked out this arrangement where I worked remotely from Dubai for three

86
00:09:10,663 --> 00:09:13,572
weeks out of the month and then for one week out of the month I would fly back

87
00:09:13,573 --> 00:09:18,163
to Singapore and do clinical work and do as much as I could there in person and

88
00:09:18,163 --> 00:09:22,993
then go back and work three weeks remotely only because I loved this job so much.

89
00:09:23,443 --> 00:09:30,133
But in January of 2020, we were really gearing up to face COVID in Singapore.

90
00:09:30,133 --> 00:09:33,623
And so at that point they asked me to fly back for a month.

91
00:09:33,643 --> 00:09:40,663
My boss in Singapore was he is a bigwig at W.H.O.

92
00:09:40,843 --> 00:09:45,793
And so they were sending him on that first fact finding mission, mission to Wuhan.

93
00:09:46,003 --> 00:09:53,893
And so while he was deployed to Wuhan, they asked me to fly back to Singapore and just be the coordinator of our COVID response.

94
00:09:54,313 --> 00:10:04,903
And so that's what I did. I flew back to Singapore for a month, which was hard because, you know, we were on the brink of this pandemic.

95
00:10:04,903 --> 00:10:09,043
And, you know, I had to leave my family behind and.

96
00:10:10,003 --> 00:10:16,563
We got ready and we got ready in ways that I think the U.S. didn't get ready until much, much later.

97
00:10:16,573 --> 00:10:22,603
So we did things like we set up emergency department tents outside.

98
00:10:22,903 --> 00:10:27,823
And these were not high tech medical grade tents the way that we used in the U.S.

99
00:10:28,213 --> 00:10:33,613
These weren't things where we had to wait for federal funding or wait for someone to give us a bunch of money.

100
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:40,243
We actually just went and spoke to catering companies and in Singapore they have

101
00:10:40,243 --> 00:10:43,483
a lot of outdoor funerals and so they're very used to doing funeral tents.

102
00:10:43,723 --> 00:10:47,203
So these were funeral tents and they erected these large structures.

103
00:10:47,353 --> 00:10:53,083
There was no HEPA filtration. These were just naturally ventilated tents.

104
00:10:53,923 --> 00:11:01,452
And we were able to see patients with natural ventilation and really, really good infection control protocols.

105
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:07,903
And there was zero transmission of COVID, even though we were seeing a very, very large number of patients a day.

106
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:15,703
So we we got ready with these tents. There's a picture in the top left corner of what a ward looks like in Singapore.

107
00:11:16,033 --> 00:11:19,443
And having private rooms is a is a very big luxury.

108
00:11:19,453 --> 00:11:24,253
So you were only given a private room if you have paid extra money otherwise.

109
00:11:24,613 --> 00:11:31,663
The wards are open air wards. So there are, you know, 30 people, 40 people in a ward with natural ventilation.

110
00:11:31,663 --> 00:11:37,302
You're just opening the windows and with natural ventilation and really good infection control policies,

111
00:11:37,303 --> 00:11:47,413
again, we had zero transmission of COVID, really just a flawless, flawless protocols.

112
00:11:48,413 --> 00:11:51,653
And Singapore got a lot of really great press.

113
00:11:51,683 --> 00:11:58,973
Singapore was heralded too. Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong were like the poster children of COVID that how can you do everything right?

114
00:11:59,003 --> 00:12:02,902
These are these are the examples. And of course, they're very different settings.

115
00:12:02,903 --> 00:12:06,623
And we have here in the U.S. and you can't replicate them because, you know,

116
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:13,313
it's just a completely different setting over here and much bigger country.

117
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:24,173
So we were feeling pretty good about how things had gone in Singapore and we got to publish lots and lots of articles really early on.

118
00:12:24,473 --> 00:12:34,253
So you can see some of these are dated in February, January, publish lots of articles on the COVID response in the early days in Singapore.

119
00:12:35,753 --> 00:12:44,182
And at the same time when all of this was happening, I was approached by the World Health Organization to help them write some guidance.

120
00:12:44,183 --> 00:12:49,223
And so in addition to managing COVID in this massive hospital system in Singapore,

121
00:12:49,913 --> 00:12:57,713
I started working for the World Health Organization and I was the lead author in the Bottom Left one.

122
00:12:58,013 --> 00:13:04,733
So Framework and Toolkit for Infection Prevention and Control in Outbreak Preparedness, Readiness and Response.

123
00:13:04,973 --> 00:13:06,952
So this is the most this is the biggest,

124
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:13,223
most comprehensive thing that the World Health Organization has issued on outbreak preparedness and the different phases.

125
00:13:14,003 --> 00:13:23,603
And this is something that I worked on. I can't even tell you how many hours I put into this document because the show is really poorly funded.

126
00:13:24,413 --> 00:13:31,222
And so you think you look at a document like this and you think that there's a team of 20 people, 30 people writing it, but it was a single person.

127
00:13:31,223 --> 00:13:37,583
It was me. And so through 2020, I worked on this document in the bottom left.

128
00:13:38,063 --> 00:13:46,103
And then later on this year, I adapted it for the for the health care setting, for the health care facility level.

129
00:13:47,843 --> 00:13:55,403
And then in July of 2020. So as things were just really heating up here in the US and other places in the world,

130
00:13:57,113 --> 00:14:01,283
my husband's job said it's time to go back to the US and we really wanted to

131
00:14:01,283 --> 00:14:07,013
go back to the US because at this time we were living in Dubai under very,

132
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:08,663
very strict lockdown.

133
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:17,033
So people here talk about lockdowns and I don't think you understand what a lockdown is until you've experienced it in some other countries.

134
00:14:17,663 --> 00:14:28,673
So in Dubai, we could leave the house for one hour every three days if we had a police permit and only one person at a time.

135
00:14:29,723 --> 00:14:35,543
And we we had to make all kinds of adjustments because you were just we were confined to an apartment.

136
00:14:36,443 --> 00:14:42,283
We taught my dog to to use the bathroom on the balcony because there was no walking your dog.

137
00:14:42,293 --> 00:14:48,983
There was no going out in public. And groceries were just, you know, once every three days, if you ran out of stuff, it was too bad.

138
00:14:49,883 --> 00:14:58,763
So we moved back in July and it was a really interesting time to be back because in Singapore we we had been living

139
00:14:58,763 --> 00:15:06,022
in this environment where it was very much a sense of community and there was no arguing about mask mandates,

140
00:15:06,023 --> 00:15:09,293
there was no pushing back about rules, about gathering limits.

141
00:15:09,863 --> 00:15:14,333
Everyone just sort of did what they were told. And the same for hospitals.

142
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:19,853
We were given a set of our marching instructions from our Ministry of Health, and then we implemented them.

143
00:15:20,243 --> 00:15:28,822
And I came back to this and it was just absolute culture shock because as an infectious disease physician,

144
00:15:28,823 --> 00:15:36,323
it was really hard to understand why people were pushing back against things that were lifesaving and that were clearly life.

145
00:15:37,193 --> 00:15:45,413
So this was a little bit of culture shock for me and I thought, you know, why don't I try to get a seat at the table?

146
00:15:45,983 --> 00:15:49,223
There were a lot of bad decisions that I saw being made in Dubai,

147
00:15:50,093 --> 00:15:54,953
and I wanted to have a seat at the table and have some input into our COVID response here.

148
00:15:55,223 --> 00:16:04,333
And so I ended up applying for a job at the State Health Department over LinkedIn, and I applied over LinkedIn.

149
00:16:04,343 --> 00:16:06,323
They interviewed me over Zoom.

150
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:16,163
I was in a hotel in Dubai in the middle of my move and had this interview and got hired as the senior public health physician for the state.

151
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:21,943
And it was a really interesting time to enter into public health.

152
00:16:22,213 --> 00:16:27,763
So I had always been involved in public health, but little public health, right?

153
00:16:27,773 --> 00:16:32,023
So I was working in hospitals and looking at outbreaks, little outbreaks,

154
00:16:32,203 --> 00:16:42,043
and now all of a sudden we are in the biggest pandemic of our lifetime and there's a lot of attention on big public health and none of it is good.

155
00:16:43,213 --> 00:16:47,473
Everyone has criticisms. Nobody likes what we're recommending.

156
00:16:48,163 --> 00:16:53,533
And we were also hearing from our local health department partners that they were being harassed,

157
00:16:53,563 --> 00:16:58,213
they were being threatened, they were being stalked online.

158
00:16:58,843 --> 00:17:03,013
And these are people that I was getting to know as my colleagues and friends and

159
00:17:03,013 --> 00:17:07,603
I was hearing from local health department health officers that they were being.

160
00:17:08,143 --> 00:17:15,523
One of them was a car trying to push him off the highway, off the road after a school board meeting.

161
00:17:15,793 --> 00:17:21,123
And people were being fired. They were being removed from their jobs after decades of hard work.

162
00:17:21,133 --> 00:17:24,463
So it was a really interesting time to be in public health.

163
00:17:26,143 --> 00:17:35,503
But this is why this graph is why I stuck it out and it is the disparities that we saw early on in the pandemic.

164
00:17:35,503 --> 00:17:38,562
So this is our mortality rate by race and ethnicity.

165
00:17:38,563 --> 00:17:48,673
And you can see these are the different COVID waves and you can see that first wave, that blue line is mortality among African-Americans.

166
00:17:49,123 --> 00:17:56,953
And I never want to see that happen again. There is no reason why one community should ever be left behind and should ever be disproportionately,

167
00:17:57,223 --> 00:18:03,193
disproportionately affected by an outbreak or a pandemic, the way that African-Americans were early on.

168
00:18:03,463 --> 00:18:09,253
And it illustrated for me all the ways that we had to improve public health and all the ways that

169
00:18:09,253 --> 00:18:15,042
we had to reduce health disparities and all of the different complex issues that fed into this.

170
00:18:15,043 --> 00:18:18,343
This was not COVID alone. This was underlying health status.

171
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:23,442
This was access to health care, this was transportation. This was folks living under the poverty line.

172
00:18:23,443 --> 00:18:28,063
This was diabetes, this was heart disease. This was everything. So this is why I stuck it out.

173
00:18:29,643 --> 00:18:35,493
And and and since then, I have been very interested in how we move forward from our COVID response,

174
00:18:35,883 --> 00:18:40,383
how we don't remain in the same phase that we were in in 2020.

175
00:18:40,683 --> 00:18:48,813
So how we think about the future and how we scale things down when we need to and how we scale things back up again when it's time to scale up.

176
00:18:49,473 --> 00:18:56,733
And one of the biggest things that I am interested in now is where do we go from here

177
00:18:57,153 --> 00:19:03,333
and how do we take the lessons learned from COVID and use them to build a better,

178
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:12,392
stronger public health system? And so one of the things that I'm working on is I chair a lot of commissions for the governor.

179
00:19:12,393 --> 00:19:15,483
And one of the commissions I chair is called the Public Health Advisory Commission.

180
00:19:15,903 --> 00:19:22,383
And we are working on interviewing people who have been critics of public health.

181
00:19:22,893 --> 00:19:27,872
We're working on talking to people who really did not like what public health did or who don't

182
00:19:27,873 --> 00:19:33,633
know what public health is or who just couldn't care less about the advice we gave and say,

183
00:19:33,633 --> 00:19:36,663
how can we do things better? How can we reengage?

184
00:19:36,993 --> 00:19:42,333
And we all know that we well, we all should know that we've got a broken public health infrastructure.

185
00:19:42,663 --> 00:19:45,572
This is an infrastructure that is not well financed.

186
00:19:45,573 --> 00:19:54,722
We have data systems that are broken, and we have a workforce that is demoralized and has PTSD, especially in Michigan.

187
00:19:54,723 --> 00:19:58,173
So they have PTSD not only from COVID, but from Flint.

188
00:19:59,013 --> 00:20:02,793
Right. There were people who worked in public health who were.

189
00:20:06,033 --> 00:20:11,283
They were trying to do their jobs. How well they were doing their jobs is a different matter, but they were trying to do their jobs.

190
00:20:11,283 --> 00:20:17,613
And there are people who are working in public health who are currently being indicted for charges like manslaughter.

191
00:20:18,273 --> 00:20:28,533
So this is a system that is really traumatized. And then in addition, the part that I'm really interested in exploring is how do we regain our trust?

192
00:20:29,223 --> 00:20:35,013
How do we regain the trust of the public? And how do we rebuild our relationships with communities?

193
00:20:35,343 --> 00:20:38,943
How do we build that relationship before the next public health crisis?

194
00:20:39,183 --> 00:20:43,803
And how do we make sure that the messaging is really targeted and unified and cohesive?

195
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:53,253
And some of the lessons that I learned in places like Singapore and working for the Cho I've tried to bring here in my role in Michigan.

196
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:58,053
So that's all I have in terms of slides and happy to have discussion.

197
00:21:08,623 --> 00:21:10,483
I am going to.
