1
00:00:00,141 --> 00:00:08,081
So in this section, I want to tell you a little bit more about what's happening at the University of Michigan.

2
00:00:08,081 --> 00:00:12,731
When I first joined the faculty in the department Nutritional Sciences,

3
00:00:12,731 --> 00:00:20,321
one of the first things I wanted to do was conduct a survey to understand, what's the prevalence of food insecurity among our own students?

4
00:00:20,321 --> 00:00:31,421
And so I was able to conduct the survey, and we emailed about 2,000 students and we got about a 151 responses.

5
00:00:31,421 --> 00:00:40,201
And so, of the students that we contacted, they were meant to be a random sample of all students who were enrolled during this academic term.

6
00:00:40,201 --> 00:00:43,661
We got about a 40% response rate. In the survey,

7
00:00:43,661 --> 00:00:51,281
we embedded questions about the demographics, food insecurity, certain health behaviors, dietary intake,

8
00:00:51,281 --> 00:00:58,451
nutrition and cooking attitudes, as well as we asked for permission to link their responses to those from their academic records.

9
00:00:58,451 --> 00:01:08,381
We can pull in things about their GPA or also just about the demographic characteristics that they didn't want to report that to us themselves.

10
00:01:08,381 --> 00:01:16,221
And what we found was that our university was not that different from all the other universities that had been studied.

11
00:01:16,221 --> 00:01:24,221
And so these are the proportion of students who responded to those indicators around food insecurity that I showed you in the very first section.

12
00:01:24,221 --> 00:01:31,961
So about 30% to 45% of students said that they worried their food was going to run out, before they had money to buy more. That their food

13
00:01:31,961 --> 00:01:38,661
didn't last, and they couldn't afford to buy more, and they couldn't afford to eat a balanced meal.

14
00:01:38,661 --> 00:01:45,951
And then around 10 to 25% of students said that they exhibited behavior responses to food insecurity.

15
00:01:45,951 --> 00:01:51,471
They cut the size of their meals or skipped meals, eat less than they felt that they should,

16
00:01:51,471 --> 00:01:58,341
they were hungry but didn't eat, and they lost weight, all because there wasn't enough money for food.

17
00:01:58,341 --> 00:02:04,891
And then about 10% of students said that they didn't eat for a whole day because there wasn't enough money for food.

18
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:12,651
So combining these indicators, remember a positive response of three or more is indicative of food insecurity,

19
00:02:12,651 --> 00:02:14,481
these were the categories.

20
00:02:14,481 --> 00:02:23,421
So 50% of our students had high food security, meaning they never worried about not being able to put food on the table.

21
00:02:23,421 --> 00:02:30,591
17.7% reported marginal food security, meaning they worried or maybe they couldn't afford to eat a balanced meal,

22
00:02:30,591 --> 00:02:36,141
but they didn't actually have to change anything about their quality or quantity of food.

23
00:02:36,141 --> 00:02:45,411
And about 31% of our students are food insecure, meaning they answered affirmatively to three or more of the questions shown here.

24
00:02:45,411 --> 00:02:49,491
So our prevalence was around 31, 32%.

25
00:02:49,491 --> 00:02:55,131
It's right in the range of those big reports around food insecurity on college campuses.

26
00:02:55,131 --> 00:03:05,061
So we were not that different from other campuses of our size. In that same study, we asked students to self report their height and weight.

27
00:03:05,061 --> 00:03:08,751
We were able to calculate their BMI, and we know self-reported

28
00:03:08,751 --> 00:03:13,131
height and weight is subject to some measurement error,

29
00:03:13,131 --> 00:03:21,431
but it's a fairly accurate measure at the population level of where students stand in terms of their BMI.

30
00:03:21,431 --> 00:03:28,851
And so this chart is showing you food insecurity and average BMI across these categories.

31
00:03:28,851 --> 00:03:36,831
Students with high food security, meaning fully food secure, never worried about putting putting food on the table,

32
00:03:36,831 --> 00:03:40,911
they had the lowest mean BMI of 23.5.

33
00:03:40,911 --> 00:03:50,571
And then, you can see that as food insecurity gets worse, gets more severe, that the average mean BMI is higher.

34
00:03:50,571 --> 00:03:55,221
So for students who had very low food security, meaning they were the most extreme group,

35
00:03:55,221 --> 00:04:02,011
the most severe form of food insecurity, they also have the highest mean BMI of 26.1.

36
00:04:02,011 --> 00:04:11,011
26.1 average BMI is not anything that would put someone in the high risk category for chronic disease.

37
00:04:11,011 --> 00:04:18,721
My concern is that we are seeing these disparities in a population of young adults who are suppose to be fairly healthy,

38
00:04:18,721 --> 00:04:26,071
not supposed to be diagnosed with any kinds of chronic diseases, and we're seeing these disparities about two to three units of BMI.

39
00:04:26,071 --> 00:04:31,831
And so what happens after college then? Are these disparities going to continue to be magnified?

40
00:04:31,831 --> 00:04:38,541
That would be my concern. Similar to the other studies I showed you,

41
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:45,591
food insecurity was also associated with mean GPA. These were pulled from students academic records,

42
00:04:45,591 --> 00:04:53,751
they were not self-reported. Students who had high food security had the highest mean GPA, 3.5.

43
00:04:53,751 --> 00:05:03,171
And as food insecurity gets more severe or worsens, you see a lower average GPA of 3.2, for the very low group.

44
00:05:03,171 --> 00:05:12,741
So this difference of 0.3, is exactly what we saw in the food security studies being conducted at the University of California campuses.

45
00:05:12,741 --> 00:05:20,631
So again, just showing the robustness of these associations across different institutions, across different geographic regions,

46
00:05:20,631 --> 00:05:32,031
still seeing that food insecurity and GPA are associated. We also looked at dietary intake, and we found that for, compared to food secure students,

47
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:36,831
students who are very low food secure had metrics of poor diet quality.

48
00:05:36,831 --> 00:05:43,701
So they eat fewer servings of whole grains and fruits, this translated into lower intakes of fiber.

49
00:05:43,701 --> 00:05:53,341
They also had higher intakes of added sugar from sugary beverages and also just from all food sources.

50
00:05:53,341 --> 00:06:01,231
We also know that food insecurity does not exist in isolation, it is associated with other basic needs insecurities.

51
00:06:01,231 --> 00:06:05,991
So things like financial insecurity and housing insecurity.

52
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:15,541
And so in this study, we looked at the burden of cumulative basic needs and how that's associated with different health outcomes.

53
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:20,611
We found that students who reported more basic needs insecurities,

54
00:06:20,611 --> 00:06:30,691
so food, financial insecurity, or housing insecurity, that more of those was associated with greater odds of anxiety and depression,

55
00:06:30,691 --> 00:06:36,151
as well as greater odds reporting fair or poor general health.

56
00:06:36,151 --> 00:06:40,811
We also found that that was associate with worse GPA.

57
00:06:40,811 --> 00:06:49,771
And so that's significant because we know that students who are food insecure are experiencing other basic needs insecurities.

58
00:06:49,771 --> 00:06:58,501
And so our solutions to food insecurity should be thinking about students holistically and not just saying, here's a bag of food,

59
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:08,851
hopefully that addresses the problem. The unanswered questions we have right now, are what are the long term implications of college food insecurity?

60
00:07:08,851 --> 00:07:14,041
A lot of our studies that are coming out, are just these single-point surveys.

61
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:20,431
We need to follow students over time to see what happens after college.

62
00:07:20,431 --> 00:07:25,111
One of the projects I'm currently working on right now is to do exactly this.

63
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:31,981
But instead of starting from scratch and trying to recruit a cohort of college students and then follow them for the next 20 years,

64
00:07:31,981 --> 00:07:38,341
we're doing this in an established study called the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, PSID for short.

65
00:07:38,341 --> 00:07:44,791
And we're looking at students who were enrolled in college between 1999 and 2003.

66
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:51,661
We know what their food insecurity status was at that point. And then we can look prospectively, because data was collected at these different

67
00:07:51,661 --> 00:07:57,451
time points already, see how food insecurity impacted their educational attainment,

68
00:07:57,451 --> 00:08:02,491
their future employment, as well as their future food insecurity.

69
00:08:02,491 --> 00:08:05,101
And while I don't have any published studies to share,

70
00:08:05,101 --> 00:08:11,521
I can tell you that our preliminary findings, are that students who are food insecure in college,

71
00:08:11,521 --> 00:08:16,291
way back 20 years ago, they had lower educational attainment,

72
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:22,351
they were less likely to complete college, and less likely to go on and get a graduate degree,

73
00:08:22,351 --> 00:08:31,261
they had slightly higher levels of unemployment, they had lower wealth accumulation in their adulthood,

74
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:37,241
and they were also more likely to be food insecure 15, 20 years down the road.

75
00:08:37,241 --> 00:08:43,291
And so this is showing that college food insecurity is not just an issue for when students are in college,

76
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:50,251
that the implications of it extend well beyond the college years.

77
00:08:50,251 --> 00:08:58,921
In the same survey, we asked students if they wanted to be interviewed by someone from my project team,

78
00:08:58,921 --> 00:09:06,301
similar to what we did at UC Berkeley. Trying to understand what is the impact of hunger for a U of M student.

79
00:09:06,301 --> 00:09:10,981
And across these interviews, we heard a couple different themes.

80
00:09:10,981 --> 00:09:18,601
So students talked about feeling sad or depressed because they didn't know where their next meal was going to come from.

81
00:09:18,601 --> 00:09:24,721
Students talked about lying to their friends or trying to avoid these awkward social situations.

82
00:09:24,721 --> 00:09:30,931
One of the students talked about how she would try to avoid going out to dinner with her roommate,

83
00:09:30,931 --> 00:09:37,471
because she didn't want her roommate to know that she couldn't pay for her dinner.

84
00:09:37,471 --> 00:09:46,861
She also talked about the times that she couldn't avoid it. She would go out to these social situations, go to dinner, go get drinks with her friends,

85
00:09:46,861 --> 00:09:55,171
but then just drink a lot of water and then say that she had a stomach ache and that's why she wasn't ordering any food.

86
00:09:55,171 --> 00:09:59,521
Another student talked about stealing food from his roommate, and just eating his roommate's

87
00:09:59,521 --> 00:10:04,981
food when his roommate went to class, and feeling really guilty and ashamed by that.

88
00:10:04,981 --> 00:10:09,181
But on the flip side, he was glad that his stomach was full.

89
00:10:09,181 --> 00:10:15,841
And then we also heard a lot of students talking about feeling lonely or feeling ashamed about being food insecure,

90
00:10:15,841 --> 00:10:21,751
because here they were in this elite academic institution surrounded by their peers who

91
00:10:21,751 --> 00:10:27,061
can afford to pay for food and housing and never have to worry about food insecurity.

92
00:10:27,061 --> 00:10:33,411
And here they were trying to figure out where their next meal was going to come from.

93
00:10:33,411 --> 00:10:39,641
We also asked some students if they wanted to participate in this photo-voice study. Photo-voice

94
00:10:39,641 --> 00:10:45,591
is a technique where you can ask participants in a study to take pictures around a theme.

95
00:10:45,591 --> 00:10:51,601
So we ask students to take pictures around their experience with food insecurity, and send them to us.

96
00:10:51,601 --> 00:10:58,641
Then we interviewed them to understand what these pictures were meant to show. So this is a picture that a student sent to us,

97
00:10:58,641 --> 00:11:02,811
and it was taken on, it's a view of our main street.

98
00:11:02,811 --> 00:11:06,681
So I personally love this part of our town,

99
00:11:06,681 --> 00:11:12,591
the lights that come up during the wintertime make it really beautiful. There's lots of restaurants and bars,

100
00:11:12,591 --> 00:11:18,531
and it's really just, there's a lot of laughter that you hear when you walk down the street.

101
00:11:18,531 --> 00:11:24,631
The student who took this picture. Her caption was, "My original plan was to walk to go get food,

102
00:11:24,631 --> 00:11:29,011
but I was walking around and I thought I should save money. I didn't get paid for another week.

103
00:11:29,011 --> 00:11:37,071
I was going to take a walk around to take my mind off of food and then go to bed. I told my friends I had steps for dinner. When I was walking around,

104
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:41,691
it took my mind off of food. I didn't really realize I was hungry. When I got back to the dorm

105
00:11:41,691 --> 00:11:47,311
I was so starving. I got chips out of the vending machine and then went to bed."

106
00:11:47,311 --> 00:11:56,221
So not the caption that you thought would go with this photo, but it kind of shows you a little bit about a student's experience with food insecurity,

107
00:11:56,221 --> 00:12:01,351
trying to distract themselves so they don't think about the physical sensation of hunger. In doing so,

108
00:12:01,351 --> 00:12:07,201
to some extent, it might work, but then at some point you just can't ignore it,

109
00:12:07,201 --> 00:12:17,081
and then you eat whatever you can find and you try to sleep it off. Here's another picture that a student has sent us.

110
00:12:17,081 --> 00:12:25,871
She said she made this blurry on purpose. The caption that came with this photo was, "That's my Spanish class from 1-2

111
00:12:25,871 --> 00:12:30,011
and most of time I haven't eaten... I had a hard time paying attention.

112
00:12:30,011 --> 00:12:35,261
It definitely is something that makes it harder for me to learn, which is the point of what I'm supposed to be doing.

113
00:12:35,261 --> 00:12:43,901
I just feel like it's one thing that kind of stands in the way that other people don't have to worry about."

114
00:12:43,901 --> 00:12:50,091
And then here's another photo that students sent us. This looks like it's his dorm room.

115
00:12:50,091 --> 00:12:56,231
And the student said, "This is reminiscent of those nights that you go to sleep and you're hungry.

116
00:12:56,231 --> 00:13:00,911
You lay there and it's empty, it's dark, and you're just there. If you're hungry,

117
00:13:00,911 --> 00:13:02,201
it's hard to sleep,

118
00:13:02,201 --> 00:13:13,991
but you're also thinking about where you're going to eat next and almost the idea of not knowing and just looking out into the darkness."

119
00:13:13,991 --> 00:13:19,381
So I want to conclude just by talking quickly about what can we do about college food insecurity?

120
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:24,541
I'm going to tell you what we're doing at the University of Michigan.

121
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:31,881
For several years, a group of really passionate students started this Maize and Blue Cupboard.

122
00:13:31,881 --> 00:13:39,651
It was a mobile food distribution that happened once a month, usually at Trotter, which is the building shown here on the left.

123
00:13:39,651 --> 00:13:46,051
And this picture was taken in April, so it was the last month of the spring semester.

124
00:13:46,051 --> 00:13:51,361
You can see students are still bundled up because it's still fairly chilly outside,

125
00:13:51,361 --> 00:13:59,161
but if you look closely, you can see that there are a lot of students lining up for this food distribution and

126
00:13:59,161 --> 00:14:05,341
that the line snakes up and down the path and goes all the way down to the main street,

127
00:14:05,341 --> 00:14:11,281
and then some. So this is just to show you that

128
00:14:11,281 --> 00:14:19,021
students were figuring out that other students were food insecure and took it amongst themselves to set up this mobile food distribution,

129
00:14:19,021 --> 00:14:22,951
to get all the food, to pack it up, and to give it out to students.

130
00:14:22,951 --> 00:14:30,491
And there was this huge need among our campus, as this picture shows.

131
00:14:30,491 --> 00:14:36,461
It took about a year and a half for us to finally get our permanent food pantry.

132
00:14:36,461 --> 00:14:46,211
And so we've adopted the Maize and Blue Cupboard name, and we've had all of the students come aboard to work with staff at the university

133
00:14:46,211 --> 00:14:57,441
to design and to basically implement this beautiful new, permanent food pantry that is not just a once a month distribution anymore.

134
00:14:57,441 --> 00:15:01,241
It is open five days a week for a set number of hours,

135
00:15:01,241 --> 00:15:07,111
and anyone with a Michigan card can swipe in to get food.

136
00:15:07,111 --> 00:15:12,211
It's set up like a grocery store so that people can shop their suggested limits,

137
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:17,081
but there's no maximum for what students can or cannot take.

138
00:15:17,081 --> 00:15:26,471
There's also, as you can see, there's a lot of canned goods and packaged foods, but there's also a freezer with a lot of different meat products.

139
00:15:26,471 --> 00:15:37,971
There are baskets with fresh produce. And then off to the side, there's a room of personal supplies as well as cooking utensils.

140
00:15:37,971 --> 00:15:42,251
And so this Maize and Blue Cupboard is now up and running.

141
00:15:42,251 --> 00:15:48,141
It officially launched just months before the university shut down due to the COVID pandemic,

142
00:15:48,141 --> 00:15:56,001
but it's still been serving an astronomical number of students who are experiencing food insecurity on our campus.

143
00:15:56,001 --> 00:16:06,291
I put the link down here, if you want to learn more about it, you can see the resources as well as, also, everything else that they provide.

144
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:09,111
Here's a little bit more about the Maize and Blue Cupboard.

145
00:16:09,111 --> 00:16:15,471
They provide food, they provide kitchen and cooking equipment, personal and household supplies,

146
00:16:15,471 --> 00:16:20,031
and then the big vision is that they will also provide support for students.

147
00:16:20,031 --> 00:16:27,291
So this could mean cooking classes that demonstrate some of the ingredients that they have in the pantry.

148
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:31,491
It could be connections to other social services, signing up for SNAP,

149
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:36,261
our food stamp program, and everything else that we know that our students might

150
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:42,111
need and might want to get as they're coming into the Maize and Blue Cupboard.

151
00:16:42,111 --> 00:16:47,481
If you feel passionate and you want to help, there's lots of opportunities to do so.

152
00:16:47,481 --> 00:16:53,661
They definitely are always on the lookout for volunteers to help with their weekly deliveries, as well as to collaborate.

153
00:16:53,661 --> 00:16:59,931
So I know in our nutrition department, a lot of our students are very passionate about leading nutrition education

154
00:16:59,931 --> 00:17:05,841
workshops or cooking classes or cooking demos, and providing support in that way.

155
00:17:05,841 --> 00:17:14,271
And then if you're lucky enough to have resources to donate, they are always looking for donations for food and supplies,

156
00:17:14,271 --> 00:17:24,701
but especially money, because money for a food pantry can go a lot longer than what we can buy at the store.

157
00:17:24,701 --> 00:17:34,301
So the report that I had showed you, about Still Hungry and Homeless in College, provided a number of ways to address food insecurity on college campuses.

158
00:17:34,301 --> 00:17:43,241
Campus food pantries are one of those. So we have that here. There are a huge network of food pantries on college campuses.

159
00:17:43,241 --> 00:17:47,891
There's actually a whole organization called the College and University Food Bank Alliance.

160
00:17:47,891 --> 00:17:56,201
Last time I checked, they had over 600 members, meaning 600 colleges across the U.S. have their own food pantries.

161
00:17:56,201 --> 00:18:01,901
There's food recovery programs. And so we have something similar like that here, where food that's left over at the dining

162
00:18:01,901 --> 00:18:06,641
halls is the end of the evening can be repackaged and distributed out to the community.

163
00:18:06,641 --> 00:18:09,521
There are a dining center meal donations,

164
00:18:09,521 --> 00:18:18,401
and so students that have un-used swipes at the end of the semester, can donate them to other students. Campus community gardens,

165
00:18:18,401 --> 00:18:24,431
we have a beautiful campus farm, and students who volunteer to work at the campus farm can take a bag of food.

166
00:18:24,431 --> 00:18:32,351
There's campus farmer's markets, there's also basic needs case management, meaning that if a student is experiencing food insecurity,

167
00:18:32,351 --> 00:18:38,751
that there's a place on campus that they can go to to seek help. And so for us, it's the dean of students office.

168
00:18:38,751 --> 00:18:46,811
There's emergency grants, and so, again, the dean of students office provides emergency assistance for students who are experiencing food insecurity, or

169
00:18:46,811 --> 00:18:50,711
who are just experiencing other kinds of emergencies that might need assistance.

170
00:18:50,711 --> 00:19:01,121
And then longer term, there should be resources like accessing SNAP benefits, emergency housing, or even having a SNAP retailer on campus.

171
00:19:01,121 --> 00:19:10,031
These are all things that the universities can do. We right now, are primarily addressing food insecurity through a food pantry.

172
00:19:10,031 --> 00:19:15,761
And I want to make the point that it's great that we have finally a permanent food pantry.

173
00:19:15,761 --> 00:19:23,531
We are not the first institution to do so, we won't be the last. But a food pantry is not the only solution to food insecurity,

174
00:19:23,531 --> 00:19:27,101
and it's not going to be our exit to food insecurity.

175
00:19:27,101 --> 00:19:36,131
We need to have a more holistic way that we're addressing food insecurity, but also ways that we are preventing food insecurity.

176
00:19:36,131 --> 00:19:41,261
And so there needs to be a lot more discussion about the institutional level,

177
00:19:41,261 --> 00:19:47,061
but also at the policy level about how we can continue to improve food insecurity.

178
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:57,161
Maybe that's increasing financial aid, so that students have enough money to not only pay for their room and board, their tuition,

179
00:19:57,161 --> 00:20:04,371
their books, and all these other costs that come along with being a student, but also enough money to pay for their food.

180
00:20:04,371 --> 00:20:13,151
It's also more robust policies so that students who are eligible for food assistance don't have to jump through so many hurdles to be able to get it,

181
00:20:13,151 --> 00:20:19,421
and they get enough benefits so that they are able to get food throughout the month.

182
00:20:19,421 --> 00:20:28,211
And then, changing our food environment, so that we have affordable outlets for groceries, close to campus.

183
00:20:28,211 --> 00:20:30,221
So on our campus, that is a huge issue,

184
00:20:30,221 --> 00:20:39,161
and I know that on a lot of campuses, too, that there is not always an affordable grocery store nearby for students who don't have transportation.

185
00:20:39,161 --> 00:20:46,361
So just thinking about all the ways that these are connected and how our institutions are currently addressing food insecurity,

186
00:20:46,361 --> 00:20:51,631
but also how we can continue to do better. So thank you very much.

187
00:20:51,631 --> 00:20:57,651
I hope you enjoyed this lecture and learned a little bit more about the experience of college food

188
00:20:57,651 --> 00:21:04,061
insecurity and can brainstorm ways that you, and other future public health leaders can do to help.
