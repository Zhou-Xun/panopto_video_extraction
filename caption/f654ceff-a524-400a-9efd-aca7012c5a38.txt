1
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,860
In this video, we will briefly

2
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:14,475
summarize the main points
learned in this course.

3
00:00:14,475 --> 00:00:17,580
Remember, this is in a way how we

4
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,360
started our data
analysis experience.

5
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,980
You have already designed

6
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:23,945
a study and collected your data.

7
00:00:23,945 --> 00:00:26,270
Now that you have
your data, is clean,

8
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:28,145
and you have a clear hypothesis,

9
00:00:28,145 --> 00:00:30,530
how do you start your analysis?

10
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,840
We then decided that
we were going to

11
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,195
follow the format of
a research article.

12
00:00:35,195 --> 00:00:36,890
That is, we were going to do

13
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:38,930
a table 1 with descriptive data,

14
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:42,335
a table 2 to help us do
some confounder assessment,

15
00:00:42,335 --> 00:00:46,315
and our table 3 would be
our multivariable analysis.

16
00:00:46,315 --> 00:00:48,400
Therefore, our table 1,

17
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,060
we decided that we
were going to include

18
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:52,955
some bivariate analysis,
that is p-values.

19
00:00:52,955 --> 00:00:55,310
We learned all the
statistical tests that

20
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:58,360
you can do depending on
the type of data you have.

21
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:01,950
Then we build a table 2 like
the one in this example,

22
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:03,870
to help us with
confounding assessment.

23
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:06,020
This is to choose the
variables that we're going

24
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:09,550
to adjust for in our
multivariable models.

25
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:12,230
Then we move into learning

26
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:14,825
different models to
build our table 3,

27
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:17,340
the one with a
multivariable model.

28
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,700
We learn all the five
models in this course.

29
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,410
Remember that four of them,

30
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:23,270
linear, logistic, log-binomial,

31
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:24,860
and Poisson belong to

32
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:27,065
the generalized
linear model family.

33
00:01:27,065 --> 00:01:28,850
But on top of them, we learn also

34
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:31,375
the Cox hazards
proportional model.

35
00:01:31,375 --> 00:01:33,440
The main thing that
you need to remember

36
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,390
from this graph is
that here you have

37
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:38,420
the most common measures
of association that

38
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:41,480
we use in epidemiological
studies: means,

39
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,925
ratios, hazard
ratios, rate ratios,

40
00:01:43,925 --> 00:01:46,465
risk ratios, and
prevalence ratios.

41
00:01:46,465 --> 00:01:49,280
Along the way, we also
learn how to evaluate

42
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,040
the statistical interaction
within those models.

43
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,145
We focus mostly in linear
and logistic regression,

44
00:01:55,145 --> 00:01:58,495
but I told you that it will
be the same for any model.

45
00:01:58,495 --> 00:02:00,570
In this table, you can see

46
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:03,045
those same five models
with their equations,

47
00:02:03,045 --> 00:02:04,220
the type of outcome, and

48
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:06,190
the type of measure
of association.

49
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:08,465
That way, summarizing again,

50
00:02:08,465 --> 00:02:09,545
with the linear model,

51
00:02:09,545 --> 00:02:11,075
you have a continuous outcome,

52
00:02:11,075 --> 00:02:13,490
normally distributed
and you get means.

53
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:14,780
With the logistic model,

54
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,910
you have a binary variable and we

55
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:19,265
model probabilities
in the form of odds,

56
00:02:19,265 --> 00:02:21,050
so you get odds ratios.

57
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:24,125
In Poisson, your
outcomes are counts,

58
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:25,295
and we model rates,

59
00:02:25,295 --> 00:02:27,565
so you get rate ratios.

60
00:02:27,565 --> 00:02:29,660
In log-binomial models, you have

61
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,385
a binary variable, again,

62
00:02:31,385 --> 00:02:34,490
and you model probabilities
in the forms of risks or

63
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:38,495
prevalence and you get risk
ratios if in a cohort study,

64
00:02:38,495 --> 00:02:41,170
and prevalence ratios if in
a cross-sectional study.

65
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:42,920
Finally, with Cox models,

66
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,570
you model time and you get

67
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:46,400
hazard ratios that can be

68
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,475
interpreted more or
less as rate ratios.

69
00:02:49,475 --> 00:02:51,590
Note that you can use some of

70
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:54,050
these models in more
than one study design.

71
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:57,665
In cohort studies, you can
use Cox and Poisson models.

72
00:02:57,665 --> 00:02:59,210
In closed cohort studies,

73
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:01,840
you can also use logistic
and log-binomial.

74
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,210
In case-control studies,

75
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:05,885
you're bound to logistic
regression models,

76
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:08,360
either the normal one
or the match version,

77
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,595
either case-controls is match.

78
00:03:10,595 --> 00:03:12,845
Finally, in
cross-sectional studies,

79
00:03:12,845 --> 00:03:15,320
you can use logistic
and log-binomial.

80
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,515
Note that this is assuming
that your variable is binary.

81
00:03:18,515 --> 00:03:20,270
Linear regression can be used in

82
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:22,535
any design as long as
assumptions are met.

83
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:24,800
That is, you cannot use
it in case-control,

84
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,195
but you can use it
with a continuous

85
00:03:26,195 --> 00:03:28,430
outcome among the controls.

86
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:30,920
In this video, we summarize

87
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,735
the main points learned
in this course.

88
00:03:32,735 --> 00:03:35,615
In the next video, we will
illustrate with an example,

89
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:38,552
what was the goal of this course.
