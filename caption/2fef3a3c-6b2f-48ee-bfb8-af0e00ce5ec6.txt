1
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:12,330
I think you. Another.

2
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:25,560
Okay. So I think. Welcome back from break, guys.

3
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:32,010
I hope everybody had at least a bit of relaxation, not two days of meetings,

4
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:39,020
which is what I had since there was calendars opened up and they were like, Oh, we need you say, great.

5
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:50,160
And so like, I know it's lunch time, so starting to present food, but we'll talk about childhood obesity today.

6
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:59,010
And as you guys know, or if some of you know, anyway, this is like a research area of mine, so I'll try to not go over.

7
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,659
But I did also want to say thank you guys for doing the survey.

8
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:09,150
I thought that was awesome. For those of you who gave like feedback and suggestions.

9
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:11,519
Thank you. I think that's really great.

10
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:19,829
I, I will say I struggle with the mini lecture how much to kind of go over because some people are like, oh, go over it more in class.

11
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:23,159
And some people are like, oh, it's all done. And then when you talk about in class too much.

12
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:26,390
So I think that's like just people's preferences differ.

13
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:34,680
And if you guys like by the end of the term also have a reflection of like dump this one, redo this one,

14
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:39,600
I am open because clearly, you know, I did those with the pandemic and I feel like I kind of like it.

15
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,850
But then I don't we don't get to kind of review as a group as much of this stuff.

16
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:48,210
So that's something to continue thinking about.

17
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:52,380
And then we will do like a small group break out today.

18
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,260
I have mentioned that like, you know,

19
00:01:54,270 --> 00:02:01,020
I tend to get get enthused and don't do as much of those and I don't love this room for that, but we will do that.

20
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:08,940
And then the other thing was like with readings, so that was a good double check for me because I tend to like,

21
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:14,370
you know, update and substitute and, you know, move things around a little bit each year.

22
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:18,149
But I don't necessarily do like a page count and I know that I give a lot of

23
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:24,059
readings that are kind of light lit and then I give like some that are more dense.

24
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:33,240
And just so you guys know, I do like to give you some of those denser, heavier ones just for your background so you have them.

25
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:38,099
And in any given session, you know, there's a lot of further reading options.

26
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:44,909
So if people want to do deeper dives like it's always available, but it did also strike me that.

27
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:54,350
So for next time, so the next two sessions, so next week we're going to be like child care, Head Start, child care debates, early education.

28
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:57,990
Like there's a lot of readings that kind of overlap across those two weeks.

29
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:03,870
And there's one in particular that I call it like The Economist's reading.

30
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:08,910
It's Greg Duncan. So that reading is for next time.

31
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:14,910
But I, I think that if people are feeling overwhelmed with reading, film responding,

32
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:24,330
you can probably not do that one and instead replace it with the pig personal readings in the following week, which is kind of a similar space.

33
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:28,260
Um, but it's more up to date and it's more of a summary.

34
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:33,030
So if people would like to dove deep into the economists, go for it.

35
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:42,270
That's a lot of like rich data in terms of why there are so many debates about early child care and the role of it and the value of it and the,

36
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:51,660
you know, cost benefit analysis of it. Um, but the peg virginal from the week of October 27th, you could also do for next time.

37
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:54,580
And frankly, you guys could like read all of it.

38
00:03:54,600 --> 00:04:00,570
You know, you could it's all sort of covering similar space as is a video, but those are probably most key.

39
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:06,900
That would be a change. What else was I going to say?

40
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:14,669
Um, any any question?

41
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:18,090
Oh, yeah. Any questions on paper? Because I know that's also coming up.

42
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:25,880
I do have office hours later today and people are available or just want to touch base or have specific questions.

43
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:35,490
Right. I'm just checking if I have a I have a meeting during office hours that I could multitask through or if somebody needs to come and chat,

44
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:41,250
I can pop out of the meeting. So, uh, what else is I going to note?

45
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:48,810
Um, those were the main things that I wanted to let you guys know about.

46
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:54,929
I may also do, like, a little quick scan through the rest of the readings and see if there's any to, like, move around.

47
00:04:54,930 --> 00:05:01,050
But I think on average, they're they're pretty balanced.

48
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:10,830
With heavier and lighter, I think by topic, because I tend to I tend to move around because can tell I move around the first part a

49
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:15,840
lot because there's like more sort of emerging research in these relational health areas.

50
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:21,839
So perhaps that's also why the reading lengths have become more unbalanced.

51
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,129
So it's a good shot for me to do so anyway. So thank you for feedback. Okay.

52
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:28,320
So today we're going to talk about childhood obesity.

53
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:40,350
I will try to get through a lot of the stuff that some of the readings are mostly about, like different intervention approaches.

54
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:42,600
And that's what we'll talk about in small groups.

55
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:50,670
But I think there's also some key kind of background info to know and to just go through fitness classes perspective.

56
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:54,480
So I will do that. Okay.

57
00:05:54,600 --> 00:06:01,379
So we've talked about this a little bit before, but just sort of to reiterate, why do we care?

58
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:04,080
Why is this so important? Why do we care?

59
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:12,780
And we particularly care early childhood about childhood obesity risk because it's really prevalent and it emerges early and it persists.

60
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:19,469
And so I think we talked about this paper or referenced it even like the first day around that incidents.

61
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:27,120
Question So like kids are likely to have obesity in eighth grade if they're overweight in kindergarten, much more likely.

62
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,430
So it's sort of like this early childhood consideration and area of focus.

63
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:38,550
The other thing to note is that some new data, relatively new 2018,

64
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:43,980
just came out kind of looking at this developmental trajectory of kind of obesity risk.

65
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:56,250
And kids who have overweight and obesity and during adolescence are much more likely to have been in those weight categories when they were younger.

66
00:06:56,250 --> 00:07:01,830
So it all kind of points to, all right, early childhood, you've got to get from this when early childhood as an issue.

67
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:09,660
But we also know and again, this should not be surprising, but just to sort of go through these numbers.

68
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:17,370
Childhood obesity is most prevalent among kids from low x home backgrounds.

69
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:25,940
So this is just some numbers from the MMW are CIS Morbidity, Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.

70
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:35,159
So which are always a good source of information. And what we see is that rates are higher among you know, this is split by females and males,

71
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:43,020
which so you can see that women tend to float a bit higher, even girls certainly by adolescence than boys.

72
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:50,400
But it's you know, I would say before income and these kind of effects swamp those those numbers.

73
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:55,290
So among kids whose parent has a high school graduate or less,

74
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:03,800
those kids have greater rates of obesity and overweight than kids of parents who are college graduates and then similar.

75
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:08,700
This is the same kind of information, but just looking straight, straight at income.

76
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:14,309
So FPL is very federal poverty line. So kids who are below that have higher rates.

77
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:20,040
It's a little like, you know, reverse, but basically like lower income, higher risk of overweight.

78
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:28,679
And again, there's just a link to that info. You know, if you guys need to pull up those numbers, they are readily available.

79
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:40,290
The CDC has also a great website with lots of info about overweight, stratified by race, by gender, by age, by sometimes by income as well.

80
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:48,120
Okay. So one thing that I think about and I think this is important to just kind of step through a little bit in terms

81
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:57,779
of all the different implications in terms of what we've all just gone through around obesity risk for ourselves,

82
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:06,120
for our children. But basically what we know are that the things that have kind of been starting here,

83
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:14,710
the things that have been happening during COVID like restriction, stay in your house, eating a food in your house or missing the food you know,

84
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:20,430
that is not in your house that you've got at school, experiencing more stress and anxiety,

85
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:24,060
having lower physical activity, having more sedentary behavior,

86
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:32,520
having screen time built in because kids were obviously at school on screens and then having sort of more parental stress.

87
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:40,890
All of that, all of those things are actually, you know, associated with greater risk for obesity over time.

88
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:49,140
And, of course, over time in a kid's life, especially when the think about early childhood, COVID has been a large percentage of these kids lives.

89
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:54,030
And so we've got to think about this cohort of kids who are, you know.

90
00:09:55,560 --> 00:10:04,230
Six, seven and under right now, because their formative early childhood time has been in the context of all of this mess,

91
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,270
along with all the other things we've talked about.

92
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:15,089
So if people are interested, you know, in this topic area, like just purely from sort of a research perspective,

93
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:22,650
all those numbers that I was just presenting there are pre-COVID because we don't have the post-COVID numbers coming out as regularly

94
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:32,100
in terms of our surveillance numbers that the early studies that are coming out are just showing that this cycle is pretty active.

95
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:39,420
The other thing here and then there's a little bit more on this, but again, why we care.

96
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:45,209
It's not only that, like kids are acquiring obesity early in childhood,

97
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:49,980
it's that when you acquire acquire this early in childhood, it has long term health risks.

98
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:58,140
And increasingly it's acknowledged that it even has health risks during childhood, which used to not be have studied quite as much.

99
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:05,760
But all of these things have been documented to happen in kids as well as over time as those kids become adults.

100
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:15,750
So, again, good reference for just, you know, COVID was bad for this specific health outcome in addition to many others.

101
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:25,530
The other thing, and again, more is coming out about this all the time, but in terms of COVID related outcomes,

102
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:31,140
kids who have obesity have been shown to do worse in terms of when they get COVID.

103
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:42,540
It's worse kind of with adults because they're kids and there are lower rates of COVID and different mechanisms operating.

104
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:48,120
It's been a little bit more difficult to detect, but we certainly see that in adults and COVID outcomes.

105
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:55,590
Okay. And so this is just another sample slide to show.

106
00:11:55,710 --> 00:12:07,560
There's lots it's just a complex body systems issue and there are lots of different areas that can be impacted by obesity.

107
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:17,180
I won't delve too far, but there's also here psychosocial here.

108
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:20,180
I think there's some missing stuff here around cognitive function.

109
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:24,020
There's more and more research coming out that is saying, you know,

110
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:33,560
obesity and like different cellular changes that happen in obesity actually are impacting cognitive function.

111
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:40,310
And there's more research on this in adults. But increasingly, there is some awareness that, gosh, maybe this is happening also with kids.

112
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:47,630
So if you think again about what does big COVID impact, more kids are sedentary, more kids are acquiring obesity.

113
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:53,470
And if that has implications for cognitive function in the context of not having been in school for two years,

114
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:58,550
it's like a frickin humongous crisis that is urgent.

115
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:04,310
And I think that that's one additional thing to put up there on that slide.

116
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:16,980
Okay. So these are probably slides people have seen in other contexts, those behavioral risk factor slides.

117
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:22,550
One thing to note is that they did change some of their methodology in 2011.

118
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:28,330
So if people have seen these slides go back just like this slide presentation.

119
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:39,090
Again, it goes back a number of years. But what's important to know is that a lot of the these data we're sort of well here,

120
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:44,370
a lot of these data were sort of color coded like this back in like the early 2000s.

121
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:55,440
But the slides and the color coding and the indicators here on the left, basically the legend changed between 2010 and 2011.

122
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:03,270
So you can't really go from the early 2000 to now in these color coded, color coded slides,

123
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:11,069
meaning like already in 2011, this region has pretty high obesity rates.

124
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:19,620
So the bright orange is 30 to 35% and then the Greens are lower obesity rates.

125
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:25,470
And if we go forward in time, we can see that these rates are increasing.

126
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:28,950
And you know,

127
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:42,689
it's pretty much Colorado where there are like mountains and sunshine 360 days of the year and sort of focus on that kind of outside culture,

128
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:51,060
I think probably has something to do with it is the only remaining green state here in 2017 in D.C. and hopefully.

129
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:56,250
And when. Oh, in Hawaii. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. Similar some similar theme.

130
00:14:56,250 --> 00:15:03,510
Right, similar theme. And obviously these don't have like race incorporated in these sites.

131
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:11,370
Right. So we know there's variability and in fact, like Hawaii has quite high obesity rates among their indigenous population too.

132
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:16,049
So it's true there's variability for sure, but generally it's a grim story.

133
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:18,030
Right. And it ends at 2020.

134
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:33,010
So like these are pre-COVID and you know, we are just in dire straits and it's just a very challenging and we have to say intractable,

135
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:38,100
but it just feels like, oh, my gosh, there's just a lot here.

136
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:44,940
And just the other thing to note is that I don't think there's actually a state that's this color I was just looking,

137
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:52,110
but they added like a higher than 40% like box in terms of the obesity rates.

138
00:15:52,950 --> 00:16:06,029
And this is all adults, I should say. This is all adults. But just kind of looking at that and thinking about, okay, adults, you know, are parents.

139
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:15,120
And within families and, you know, raising kids model behaviors for kids and have to find food for their families.

140
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:19,530
That's pretty grim statistics in Michigan. I think Michigan has been.

141
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:23,850
Yeah, Michigan just crossed over into the high. What was the highest percentage?

142
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:32,370
Yeah, my PCG was talking about this and she was saying that she's seeing a lot of people gained 10 to £20 during COVID.

143
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:35,910
So I can only imagine what kids like, what that would look like.

144
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:40,620
Yeah. I mean, I don't know about you guys, but I like working at home.

145
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:45,500
Is rough for trying to monitor what's eating behavior.

146
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:50,340
Speak for myself like it's just a different game.

147
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:58,799
And I think during COVID, I don't know how many, you know, we're kind of aware of all this news, but like, you know,

148
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:09,600
so many kids whose nutrition comes from school, we're just blocked from receiving that overall for at least a few weeks for a while.

149
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:14,430
And then they kind of did these, you know, sort of heroic measures, I would say,

150
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:21,329
like the individuals working in school settings and and food and nutrition settings to sort of connect up and say,

151
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:25,920
oh, my gosh, we have to get food to these kids because they don't they don't have any food.

152
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:38,760
Whatever food they have is, you know, not healthy. And so that was a huge change and shift in context for kids and childhood obesity.

153
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:43,220
Yeah. Okay. I'm currently working at. Yeah.

154
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:52,190
They count the hash browns as a vegetable and they don't out it every single meal, which isn't a bad thing.

155
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:59,959
But not everybody can drink it. Yeah. It's not like they aren't very accommodating for any different,

156
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:07,240
like dietary restrictions per se, unless you have, like, medical doctor information like.

157
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:12,590
So it very much limits kids. I'm just saying that.

158
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:16,670
And and they take the vegetable and most of the kids they.

159
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:25,980
Like you see it at all the schools. They're just like throwing out whole animals because they have to take it, but they never eat it.

160
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:34,950
So it's like kind of like, okay, we have this system in place, but are we making sure that, like, it works?

161
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:38,970
I don't know. That's just like a side. No, on top of just, like, access.

162
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:46,140
Absolutely. And it's not a side note. It's like a really critical note.

163
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:51,330
And I think that, again, like when we look at these numbers,

164
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:59,730
it's so easy to become just like overwhelmed and be like the food industry and commuting and our lives and like, what can we do?

165
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:02,130
And I think that's that's valid.

166
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:13,950
And I think these like very top down food policy, farm bill legislation, like very, very top down changes can could make a difference here.

167
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:19,170
But I think then you have these individual behaviors that are really important.

168
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:23,940
Like what do kids do when they're given an apple? Do they eat it? Why don't they eat it?

169
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:27,180
How can we help them? How can we have them try it? And they do.

170
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:33,540
And a lot of obesity resources like plate waste studies in exactly that context of school cafeterias.

171
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:41,580
And it's true. I mean, just like the vegetables go into the trash and like, how does that how can we shift that?

172
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:48,629
And that's a much more a much more nuanced set of conversations and things to think about.

173
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:51,150
So I'm glad you brought that up from the beginning,

174
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:58,290
because I think that it's not easy to stay at this level regardless because it's just such like awful statistics.

175
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:08,309
But we need to both end, right, because we have a lot of people now that 40% of people in kids who are with living with obesity,

176
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:11,640
like what do we do for that group who's already.

177
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:15,479
Working with us on that. One of those readings,

178
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:22,770
a Hutchinson one that's like got all the sort of pediatric information that's like a good kind of cookbook type of reading to say,

179
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:27,480
like, here are the things that we can try for people who are already living with obesity.

180
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:33,500
Karen Yeah, just like to that point about what kids want to eat school.

181
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:39,389
And I think that has a lot to do with like what they eat at home and like what their parents introduced them to.

182
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:43,630
And I think that with like my own friends and like whether their parents like, sure.

183
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:46,770
Fed them seafood as a kid and whether they like it now.

184
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:52,020
Um, so I feel like that creates further disparities because like what kids are eating,

185
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:56,940
if they're eating fresh fruits and vegetables at home, then they feel comfortable at school.

186
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:03,670
But if they're not, then introducing some strange new food, you want to try it?

187
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:08,430
Absolutely. And what are we presenting kids with at school?

188
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:10,049
And that may be different from what they eat at home.

189
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:18,780
And maybe what they eat at home is healthier or different, culturally different or lots of, you know, variability there and sort of saying, you know,

190
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:25,620
and hopefully we get to the menus at the end because that's like some sort of school menus that we could just look at and sort of analyze and,

191
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:31,770
you know, perhaps be like, Ooh. So yeah, there's a lot going on with sort of what's presented.

192
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:36,719
Yeah. Yeah. So how much does the actual food like?

193
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:42,840
I don't know if you've seen school lunches, but like it's like cardboard at least like where I was.

194
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:49,470
So like how much of an impact on health does that actually have if you're just consuming something that's like.

195
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:55,090
Entirely put us, like, squeezed out of here.

196
00:21:56,510 --> 00:22:01,030
Yeah. I mean, I think that it's all relative.

197
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:08,710
So, you know, kids who have no food at home and that's the only place they're getting a meal.

198
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:15,600
That's a really important stopgap. Yeah, there are sort of the other ends.

199
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:17,799
Like there are like, you know,

200
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:24,790
you talk about places like France where they're like growing in a garden and the kids go out and pluck lettuce during their eating.

201
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:29,290
You know, that's a whole different you know, that's a wonderful food experience.

202
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:34,599
And you could encourage trying new things and, you know, but to do that at scale is very difficult.

203
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:40,360
And so I think that's like when the school lunch program comes up for federal when

204
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:46,270
they won't they argue over things like is a vegetable but does a potato a vegetable,

205
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:52,390
like if you guys are too young for Reagan, but like ketchup as a vegetable was like this whole debate.

206
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,290
Right. And it turned out that they said, oh, yeah, your ketchup counts as a vegetable.

207
00:22:56,950 --> 00:23:01,779
And I don't know how many people like the nutrition people are like, oh, but that's the thing.

208
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:05,679
I mean, that's, that's, and that's where like it's at food policy level.

209
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:08,680
And really the farm bill is an important piece of that.

210
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:13,930
That's where that stuff gets hashed out. And those definitions are crucially important because it determines, right,

211
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:22,140
like whether kids get a squeezed out at something or something else that the USDA is sitting on.

212
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:26,050
And you know what? Sorry. What would you guarantee you, the USDA or.

213
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:31,030
So like, I can't believe that.

214
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:40,300
Like, it's still not like the controversial policy that you have, like the person who is selling the goods, delegating the house.

215
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:43,960
That's so messed up to me. Yeah.

216
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:53,050
So it's very like there are some conflicts of interest, which is, I think what is reflected in.

217
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:58,510
Yeah. Yeah. But so like who makes decisions about these?

218
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:01,630
Like what is, what is, what are, what is food?

219
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:08,470
If you listen to like Michael Pollan, like the kind of, you know, on the other end food guy, what is healthy food?

220
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:16,360
What is like culturally appealing food like that doesn't even get sort of debated and that can be in a very school level.

221
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:24,370
We did one study where we were working with Head Start menus and Head Start, which we'll talk more about next week.

222
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:28,690
But they have to meet a minimum like health guideline, like nutrients guideline,

223
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:31,839
but you can meet that in different ways and you can read it with sort of like

224
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:36,070
highly processed chicken nuggets or sort of less processed chicken nuggets.

225
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:45,579
And the food guidelines don't get to like the sort of overlay of processing that is in the food versus the lack of processing.

226
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:52,390
And that sort of coming out as a key indicator of the healthfulness of food, sort of regardless of like caloric content.

227
00:24:52,540 --> 00:25:01,689
So there's a lot of nuance in that nutrition and nutrients world that I'm sure is driving some of these numbers,

228
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:04,540
but like we're not legislating it at that level.

229
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:13,240
And the other thing I would say about the food industry is that they just know how to make stuff taste delicious, that we all want to eat.

230
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:20,890
And that's too bad because that lowers the barrier for like sitting at home and you're like, I really want that peanut butter or whatever.

231
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:29,910
Yeah. Jackie Yeah, no, the other thing. So from my internship in Hawaii, like one of the projects is like looking at food in schools and um,

232
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:34,030
because they have initiative to increase it to like 30% of like local foods.

233
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:42,430
But like we were diving in, I was working on food producers barriers and they had like, I mean the market access was one thing,

234
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:50,049
but they also had like so many other barriers to even like increase production and be able to supply and meet like market

235
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:58,240
pricing that it was essentially like impossible to like be able to increase local food production to like supply schools.

236
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:04,060
So then there's like that whole other side of the problem as well, like the agricultural industry.

237
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:11,230
Absolutely. And what, something subsidized and then pushed out to schools.

238
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:17,739
Yeah. And that and that. The other thing I was joke about living in Michigan and I'm like, farm to table is really hard to do here.

239
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:22,390
Like in March, you know that's just. Tough.

240
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,570
That's like a tough charge.

241
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:31,550
And so thinking about doing that, you know, that's like restaurants where people would pay top dollar to eat, fancy farm to table vegetables.

242
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:37,240
And like schools are not going to be able to do that if they don't have that buying power.

243
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:41,020
Right. So yeah, like it's kind of like processing.

244
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:44,210
We're like big barriers and water, water present.

245
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:48,680
Mm. That's interesting feature for sure.

246
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:55,910
Um, let's see. Cali. Yeah, you mentioned the food industry, like making everything really good.

247
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,850
Yeah, I went to Europe in high school.

248
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:07,100
My favorite food ever is Costa, so I was so excited to go to Italy and eat real Italian pasta and it tasted nothing like it tastes here.

249
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:12,760
And it wasn't bad. I was just shocked and I'm like, Why?

250
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:17,960
Yeah. He's like, Well, because in America, like, everything is processed, everything is added sugar additives.

251
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:22,310
The portion sizes are crazy here compared to their.

252
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:24,200
And I realized that while I was there,

253
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:29,690
I got used to eating the smaller portions and I was still satisfied when I come here at the same meal at a restaurant.

254
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:35,840
So it probably is more of a U.S. issue that we have with this.

255
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:39,860
And I am sure a lot of people don't realize it because I didn't realize it.

256
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:45,229
I was 17. I was crazy. It's like a rude awakening, like other people have like this.

257
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:48,980
And then I wonder why everyone laughs. Right, right.

258
00:27:48,980 --> 00:28:01,969
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Similar to that, I my internship over the summer was in Israel and they are really strict about like their processed foods.

259
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:09,650
Everything is marked like even like if you went to a bakery, everything that was packaged was labeled.

260
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:19,370
If there was like more than the allotted like amount of butter or sugar or like trans fat, like it was all like very well labeled.

261
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:27,349
So you knew exactly what you were eating and you're making that decision to eat those like higher fatty foods, I guess.

262
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:38,060
And they have like American candy stores where everything is like an export from the U.S., but it's all labeled like export.

263
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:45,380
So I like I didn't realize that at first. I bought a bag of Cheetos and I took a bite and I was like, These are disgusting.

264
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,880
And then I realized because they totally have to, like,

265
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:54,260
change all the ingredients to make like the same types of foods, but they taste totally different.

266
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:58,490
It's just interesting. Yeah, in Israel that's interesting.

267
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:07,250
And that is like, yeah, that, that labeling and like what we put on our labels and what that means and what we can call, for example, like organic.

268
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:11,240
And, you know, there's a lot of wiggle room around labels as well.

269
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,950
Yeah, yeah, I know.

270
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:18,709
I had a couple friends that went over to Europe this summer, and this is something that I've kind of like seen online and read about too,

271
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:28,760
is that they didn't have any of their like see issues like so they didn't have any like sensitivities to lactose or gluten,

272
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:33,700
like just being in, just being in another country time.

273
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:39,740
Like they were kind of just like everything was moving and working well and like,

274
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:45,290
I feel like, well, I, yeah, I really like losing weight is like, is like an issue here.

275
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:50,299
It's just so much harder for people to and it was just like so natural.

276
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:56,270
Like, you're eating less and you're walking around and you're eating normal food and your body's functioning normally.

277
00:29:56,270 --> 00:30:04,730
And it's like, we live here. And I don't, I think like because we live in, I would fail to realize how much of that like is caused by that.

278
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:10,820
But yeah, I'm sure kids are, kids are definitely affected by that as well.

279
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:16,070
Yeah. Yeah. And I think I find that so fascinating cause I'm also like vacation eating.

280
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:24,200
But yeah, like, yeah. And I think that this we're all, we're focusing on talking about eating, but of course like the whole ecosystem.

281
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:30,180
And I think it's interesting because COVID like it's decreased our steps probably.

282
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:33,920
Certainly on average, there's just like a report about that this morning on the radio,

283
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:41,809
but we're also commuting less so like could people be substituting that time, you know, with other things.

284
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:56,330
So it's really complicated. And I think, yeah, in the U.S. that that food industry component is so important and hard to hard to get away from.

285
00:30:57,170 --> 00:31:08,209
Like it takes a Herculean effort and a lot of money to exist outside kind of industrial food system like Herculean levels of both of those things.

286
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:15,110
Right. And time if you want to like make your own baby food and all of that stuff that we talked about like, you know.

287
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:21,270
So there's definitely a rich context with with.

288
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:26,430
All of those things, all of those elements, what we see.

289
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:34,840
So the thinking of the kids and that issue of, you know, how kind of money and age and food and everything kind of overlap.

290
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:40,780
And we do see disparities by race that are not surprising.

291
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:45,730
And these numbers that are most broken out are from 2014.

292
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,500
So again,

293
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:58,840
pre-COVID and the other thing that I find always important to point out and particularly particularly worrisome is that even under two years,

294
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:05,950
there are sort of higher rates over time of infant.

295
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:11,860
And what we measure infants are waiting for link when they wait for length scores.

296
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:20,050
It's all talk about measurement, but that's sort of the unit of measure for kids who are under two years old is wait for length.

297
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:26,559
That makes sense because like they're lying down to be measured, although two year olds don't love to be lying down to be measured.

298
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,730
But that's sort of a separate issue.

299
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:40,300
But so what we know actually is that in infancy, so the the rate at which a kid will gain weight in infancy predicts their later overweight.

300
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:47,829
And so it's really fascinating for those of us who study eating behavior and infants and going like, well, what is that?

301
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:50,680
You know, is it this food inverted? Is it the formula quality they're getting?

302
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:58,270
Or, you know, in the case of formula shortages, like not getting getting whatever they could lay their hands on right this past summer.

303
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:03,220
Is it an infant's eating behavior style or do they just eat more quickly?

304
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:11,290
Is it something else going on in their environments, like what is happening in this infancy period that is particularly troubling?

305
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:17,780
Troubling. And then Wick, which I think we've talked about a little bit, but that's a, you know,

306
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:22,030
federal federally funded program for women and infants who are living in poverty.

307
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:32,649
And so kids there are young 0203025 baby and we see higher rates of obesity in that population.

308
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:37,270
So getting that for the mirrors, that's okay.

309
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:45,639
There's lots of factors. One thing I'll note is that some of these cultural differences in infancy, some, like anthropologists and stuff,

310
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:50,020
have looked at, you know, just sort of cultural differences and what it looks like a healthy infant.

311
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:56,049
Right. And so people have looked at that. We've talked about intergenerational families here before.

312
00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:59,709
And so if you're thinking about like, you know, the grandma who thinks,

313
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:04,120
you know, the chubby infant is the healthy infant, that's difficult to overcome.

314
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:07,780
Right. Especially maybe if you're a young mom and you're like trying to you know,

315
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:12,130
you've read this research and you're like, oh, I don't want my infant to rapidly gain weight.

316
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:15,490
And then my mom keeps feeding my infant and she's I mean, caregiver.

317
00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:19,210
So, you know, we can see how it's all like really complex, complicated to work out.

318
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:26,200
Okay. So let me just say, we're about assessments and what we mean.

319
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:34,599
So obesity and overweight. And so we're probably all familiar with BMI and this is how we measure BMI in kids.

320
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:42,310
It's really important to adjust for age and sex. And so there are standards out there that in any sort of child BMI study,

321
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:51,610
hopefully they have adjusted for age and sex because those are very related to both weight and height in adults as well as kids.

322
00:34:52,630 --> 00:35:01,150
And so often what we do is we adjust, do these adjustments, we convert it to a Z score with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of of one.

323
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:07,569
And so then what we see is that kids who are at the higher end have this higher standard deviation.

324
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:21,340
And we categorize kids who are in this range as having overweight and then in the obese range as kids who are having BMI is over or equal to 95%.

325
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,799
And then compared to norms is really important to note because there are different norms.

326
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:33,460
And so what we use in the US are CDC norms and again like the nutrition, people can type in with any cutting edge information.

327
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:42,610
But basically these norms were developed a long time ago and they don't really reflect our current population.

328
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:46,210
And so that is also one reason it's true,

329
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:52,120
but it's that like we're moving up in terms of the percentage of us who are

330
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:58,510
going above those norms and it's just sort of this population shift in weight.

331
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:08,380
And so the word norms is interesting because the norm right now is a BMI of overweight.

332
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,870
And so, you know,

333
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:18,580
the terminology of how we reference all these different body shapes and body types I think is important to be aware of and think about,

334
00:36:18,850 --> 00:36:21,230
because we also know that there's this whole huge.

335
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:34,570
Stigma element and what's going on in that space to sort of psychologically what does normal weight sort of term normal weight has sort of you know,

336
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:42,550
it was passing out of the obesity literature because normal weight in terms of like a population norm right now is overweight.

337
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:45,380
And so it's just like a complicated again, complicated space.

338
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:56,110
The other thing to note is that here, severe obesity with BMI is over 120, 240% per these norms.

339
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:59,980
Age, sex, connected arms is also on the rise.

340
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:06,550
And so the younger you are and the heavier the more pounds for later.

341
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:09,730
The other thing to note is that this is all talking about BMI,

342
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:18,550
but what's probably more important are these other adiposity indicators, like different types of fat cells in your body.

343
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,479
And, you know, BMI is helpful. We have all those charts.

344
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:27,070
We've measured it for a long time, but it's definitely not the be all and end all.

345
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:36,070
And that's important to note. And in these bigger studies, it's harder to get adiposity measures, especially on kids.

346
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:40,990
So there are some others like articles that really dove deep into this.

347
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:49,510
One way you can get adiposity indicators. If anybody's heard of like a body pod or these things that you like get a total.

348
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:55,570
It's like a readout of like a fat in your body that's possible to do with kids.

349
00:37:55,930 --> 00:37:59,560
There's a peapod that's for instance, but it's pretty aversive.

350
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:09,070
And so imagining doing like a nationwide representative study using these more intrusive measures is kind of overwhelming.

351
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:15,010
But that would probably be helpful if we could somehow get that level of like surveillance going.

352
00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:20,860
Okay, so that's BMI and sort of adiposity measurements.

353
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:32,140
This is that increase in severe obesity. So you can see it's less than run of the mill obesity, so 88 or 95th or above, but it is increasing.

354
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:37,510
And again, just note that these are these most recent 2018 numbers and we haven't accounted for COVID yet.

355
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:41,080
So like, I don't know if it's going to go up at the end. It might.

356
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:46,030
I suspect it probably will, unfortunately. Okay.

357
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:54,820
So the other thing I wanted to just make sure we talked about a little bit is that this awareness of like kids are growing,

358
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:59,380
are they becoming, you know, into an obese or overweight category or not?

359
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:05,740
And what does that look like? And so this is a weight for link disease, score chart for like a baby.

360
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:10,860
And if you look at these lines like these, this is zero median middle line.

361
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:13,780
Your line is where you want to be. It's a 50th percentile.

362
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:19,690
And so sometimes that you look like, you know, you don't want to be in the 95th percentile for obesity,

363
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:23,680
like you don't want to be there for other things. Right. But like not for this growth chart.

364
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:31,660
And so that above the line is risk for overweight and then to standard deviations above is like the overweight category.

365
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:39,370
And then there's the obese with everybody sort of up in the severity. So we need be higher, but you'll see like, you know,

366
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:42,879
this is like such an obvious point that it's sort of easy to forget when you're

367
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:47,140
talking about change over time in particular and kids because they're growing anyway.

368
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:51,879
So like if you saw no change over time, like the kid would be in very bad shape, right?

369
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:59,230
They would be like malnourished, super underweight. And another way to just sort of illustrate that is like this kid is growing,

370
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:04,570
they're putting on weight and they're putting on height, but they're staying at the median.

371
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:08,710
And so they're sort of in that normal weight category.

372
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:18,100
This kid is crossing percentiles, so they're sort of increasing in their like slope of growth or rate of growth over time.

373
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:23,080
And so as kids start to what we call it, cross these percentiles, that's when they get concerned.

374
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:27,610
And this is like a growth chart that you'd see in a pediatric setting.

375
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:31,419
Maybe the pediatrician will see it and the parent may or may not see it.

376
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:37,510
So this is another whole question about like, you know, how do you share information about child weight and growth with parents?

377
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:42,639
But this could be, you know, maybe in a slightly more accessible format,

378
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,969
something you could share with parents and say, oh, you know, John is doing fine.

379
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:48,160
We noticing his weight's creeping up a little bit.

380
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:54,100
Let's try to work on that, you know, before we see in the next time when it's going to be crossing more percentiles.

381
00:40:56,260 --> 00:41:02,980
Okay. The other thing that's important to know, again, about kids is that there's this phenomenon of positive rebound,

382
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:10,420
meaning if you think about a little infant, they've got a lot of fat cells, which is important.

383
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:15,069
They're like growing their brains. And that's all really important for infant growth.

384
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:21,010
Like infants need fat and so they're sort of body mass.

385
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:25,450
Stuff here is higher because they're little chubby infants.

386
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:31,840
But what happens when those kids grow and then they put on you know, they put on height.

387
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:39,610
They grow taller. Is that they're fat, mass decline.

388
00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:46,569
And then this like little dip that's sort of the purple arrows here is called adiposity rebound.

389
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:52,960
So that's the point at which if you think about like a little skinny kind of preschool to early school age kid,

390
00:41:53,500 --> 00:42:01,240
they're kind of skinny and growing really fast. And then that growth rate kind of slows, but they still are putting on weight.

391
00:42:01,930 --> 00:42:10,719
Then they start to go up in the growth chart. And so what we know about this adiposity rebound as it floats, this is aged by year.

392
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:13,960
So this is like a seven year old and this is a three year old.

393
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:22,390
So if you track this kid's growth, this kid has kind of skinny out at like age three and then they're going up in weight.

394
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:27,610
This kid is skinny here for longer and they're older.

395
00:42:27,610 --> 00:42:34,660
When they start to kind of go on, they're more like, you know, teen ultimately teen growth trajectory.

396
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:45,250
And so what research has shown is that the later your adiposity rebound happens in your personal life, the lower risk of obesity.

397
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:53,319
So that's again playing to this early childhood time as like could we delay we push out this adiposity rebound,

398
00:42:53,320 --> 00:43:01,360
which is a normal developmental phenomenon, but can we just push it like delay it as a way of thinking about obesity prevention?

399
00:43:02,290 --> 00:43:11,139
Okay. And then I think the last thing on kind of growth developmental stuff is that here this is this body body fat percentage thing.

400
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:20,110
So here like at birth and throughout, you know, the first year of life, you're packing on body fat, which is good because we need that for growth.

401
00:43:22,830 --> 00:43:29,590
Here is this. We're sort of going down. This is like a global reduction in the body fat.

402
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:35,310
Also, walking onset occurs right then and the kids start to grow more.

403
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:39,190
So that's sort of all contributing to like ultimately that adiposity rebound.

404
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:49,840
And then here we can see there's a huge difference here between males and females in terms of body fat linked to puberty.

405
00:43:51,280 --> 00:44:00,970
We know that girls go through pubertal changes earlier than boys and so that's going to drive this body fat changes.

406
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:07,570
We also know that kids with obesity, it can prompt earlier puberty.

407
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:11,710
So it's really a bi directional set of events that happen.

408
00:44:13,090 --> 00:44:17,200
But if you think about we'll talk more about this in adolescence, but like, you know,

409
00:44:17,410 --> 00:44:25,090
a 12 year old girl can look like an adult many times and a 12 year old boy sort of rarely looks like an adult.

410
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:36,070
And so there's this complicated interaction with puberty growth and obesity risk, and we see that kind of play out differently for girls and boys.

411
00:44:36,490 --> 00:44:47,230
So if we think about it in terms of what what girls tend to and this is kind of becoming more true for boys as well,

412
00:44:47,830 --> 00:44:57,639
like body image issues, eating disorders, exercising to avoid weight gain for boys.

413
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:01,180
It's often like trying to put on muscle mass and being like muscular.

414
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:11,469
All of these sort of body image issues are sort of, you know, linked up with this response to how your fat deposition is changing over time.

415
00:45:11,470 --> 00:45:15,910
And some of it, you know, again, in puberty, that's just what happens.

416
00:45:15,910 --> 00:45:21,880
That's just biology. You get fat, increases that puberty if you're female, more so than male.

417
00:45:25,030 --> 00:45:32,080
Okay. Let me see if there's anything else about this, like growth patterns, development.

418
00:45:32,290 --> 00:45:36,280
Okay. So those are kind of like normative developmental processes.

419
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:47,480
Okay. The other thing to kind of throw in there and this is kind of like Nico's point about like what if kids don't eat the,

420
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:51,890
you know, vegetable, potato, vegetable or apple, whatever at lunch?

421
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:56,150
We also know that people just vary in their like appetites.

422
00:45:56,900 --> 00:46:03,229
We don't know why entirely. But what we do know is that these foods that are high in sugar,

423
00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:09,020
fat and salt that we think of as comfort foods can really this is from animal research.

424
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:14,720
They can really calm our stress biology and our stress responses so that like cortisol, those cortisol blips,

425
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:20,300
if you eat foods that are high in sugar and salt and actually it's like physiologically soothing to you.

426
00:46:21,410 --> 00:46:31,160
And so in adults, it's been shown that when we're stressed, we we've been given the option, we will eat more comfort food.

427
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:36,169
So like in these lab tasks, I'm sure you guys have heard about like you stress people out and then they like walk down

428
00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:40,999
the hall to do a task and they can encounter like a bowl of carrots or a bowl of cookies.

429
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:47,329
And if the people the people who got stressed or eat the cookies and not the carrots on the way to that task, because they're like stressed.

430
00:46:47,330 --> 00:46:52,370
They're trying to remember, oh, I got to go do a task. I'm given this food choice.

431
00:46:52,370 --> 00:46:56,029
I'm going to go with the comfort food choice because it's just more appealing.

432
00:46:56,030 --> 00:46:59,629
And I don't have like the self regulation or willpower to like resist that

433
00:46:59,630 --> 00:47:04,100
cookie and eat the carrot instead of that's sort of a whole area of research.

434
00:47:06,470 --> 00:47:12,580
That cycle is particularly likely to be true if you sort of endorse, Oh yeah, I'm a stress eater.

435
00:47:12,590 --> 00:47:20,510
Like when I am stressed, I tend to go for comfort foods and that profile is more common in females.

436
00:47:20,870 --> 00:47:30,139
So and among individuals who are overweight, there's some work looking at brain responses and these food cues.

437
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:34,670
There's a lot of different research in this area, so people are interested having to talk further.

438
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:41,950
I have one colleague in psychology who works a lot in this space and looks at like food addiction and actually sort of changes in the brain,

439
00:47:41,970 --> 00:47:45,020
responses to different food, different stimuli, etc.

440
00:47:45,830 --> 00:47:48,110
So lots in that space and I won't go too far.

441
00:47:48,230 --> 00:48:00,889
But the other thing is that we think about food as sort of a key like stress regulator for kids too, and it makes sense.

442
00:48:00,890 --> 00:48:07,390
Like I think his example of like a kid can't come home and like have a glass of wine in the evening, you know,

443
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:15,410
or like smoke a cigaret or these other behavior things that we do or hopefully have kind of, you know, but they could eat a cookie, right?

444
00:48:16,070 --> 00:48:25,280
And if we think about like parenting and stress and all the things that kids are doing in a way that you can calm down is like give a kid a cookie.

445
00:48:26,810 --> 00:48:31,940
And it's very easy and it's very immediate and it's very physiological, physiologically soothing.

446
00:48:32,930 --> 00:48:37,310
And so I think all of these components are sort of beginning. This is a lot of my research.

447
00:48:38,210 --> 00:48:44,300
They're sort of beginning to be recognized that like, hey, this these processes like operating for kids to.

448
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:53,029
Okay. So, like, until we can make a carrot, a soothing as a cookie, I feel like we're just in this space.

449
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:57,170
And so we have to kind of think about then what we can do about it.

450
00:48:57,650 --> 00:49:06,110
So we've talked a little bit. I mean, this is sort of a very obviously overly simplistic idea of the the the issue.

451
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:11,900
At the same time, that's kind of where a lot of interventions focus.

452
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:17,390
Um, I think we know it's not so simple, but for lots of different reasons.

453
00:49:17,810 --> 00:49:22,040
So one of the things with regard to like obesity epidemics is that people talk about,

454
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:27,320
well, these changes have happened so rapidly in terms of like human time.

455
00:49:27,710 --> 00:49:33,350
Something about the big picture environment has changed already talked about lots of reasons for that.

456
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:42,080
We haven't talked about necessarily sort of environmental toxicants and chemical changes, but that's something that contributes.

457
00:49:43,910 --> 00:49:49,820
Not all people are equally affected by this. So we have like the stress eaters of the non stress eaters, for example.

458
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:58,910
Um, and also due to these kind of subtle developmental and growth issues, these kind of risks can be difficult to detect in kids and children.

459
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:09,259
Okay. And so what does this mean for child focused behavioral interventions, knowing that we would love to change the food industry,

460
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:14,270
we would love to change environmental toxicants and do all these other big picture things.

461
00:50:14,690 --> 00:50:18,019
But even if we do that, that's probably not totally sufficient.

462
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:21,290
So what can we do sort of in a behavioral interventions space?

463
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:29,180
Okay. So one of those readings was about like just this idea of, you know,

464
00:50:29,390 --> 00:50:35,900
incorporating those big contextual factors and thinking about how those shape our interventions.

465
00:50:37,730 --> 00:50:42,950
And I think the way that that I talk about this is like I often use that term

466
00:50:42,950 --> 00:50:46,909
social contextual factors in there saying environmental factors of the context,

467
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:57,500
but it's the same thing. So how do we think about allowing environmental factors of the context or social contextual factors like a school or a

468
00:50:57,500 --> 00:51:05,680
family context or a neighborhood shape the intervention to have when you kind of integrate that actively into intervention.

469
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:09,350
And how do we need to actively integrate that into an intervention that is behavioral?

470
00:51:09,890 --> 00:51:15,050
So okay, so I'm going to just put up some of these actually, I'll just put them all up.

471
00:51:15,770 --> 00:51:20,929
These risk factors that are potential behavioral intervention targets.

472
00:51:20,930 --> 00:51:25,580
And many of these we've kind of talked about in different ways and we're sort of applying these to obesity right now.

473
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:31,430
I use this word all the time, Obesogenic.

474
00:51:31,430 --> 00:51:39,299
It's like a horrible word, but it's totally used in this research literature and we talk about obesogenic risk factors.

475
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:44,240
So like prenatal influences, stress, weight gain, etc.

476
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:46,700
Feeding, eating and nutrition.

477
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:53,569
So we've talked a little bit about that and how that can pop up in different contexts and then also haven't talked about but is really

478
00:51:53,570 --> 00:52:00,770
important is sleep and getting regular sleep can be protective against obesity risk particular particularly in young children.

479
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,299
But speaking of puberty and adolescence, we know that also shifts around.

480
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:17,450
So like sleep is a is an interesting one and then screen time, sedentary behavior and physical activity are all potential sort of behavioral targets.

481
00:52:18,050 --> 00:52:23,300
Another one I don't like but is used all the time for intervention.

482
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:26,810
Okay. So it's 1222.

483
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:38,659
So what I wanted you guys to do in like little groups is thinking about the stuff we've talked about around children and families and

484
00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:46,490
intervention approaches and things to kind of consider in the environment what kinds of specific social contextual factors would play a role in.

485
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:51,260
And you can pick one area of behavioral intervention targets and how might we address those?

486
00:52:52,130 --> 00:52:57,920
And then like when in development might be a good time to intervene in some of these?

487
00:52:58,970 --> 00:53:03,920
And why would that time, that developmental time, be helpful to intervene?

488
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:10,310
And so, Aaron, I'll stop talking, but why don't we go?

489
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:14,690
I just feel like in terms of this room, if you guys want to gather by.

490
00:53:19,370 --> 00:53:22,430
Did anybody else hear that goes on? Oh! Oh, my God.

491
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:27,139
That was like. I was just like, I know it sounds like an animal.

492
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:30,590
And I'm like, Oh, man, where are you going? Sorry.

493
00:53:32,330 --> 00:53:37,370
You're just like, you know?

494
00:53:38,030 --> 00:53:43,220
But I'm like, Oh, my God. Okay, okay, okay.

495
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:47,540
Why don't we do, like, why don't we do like a just a little break out by kind of physical space?

496
00:53:47,540 --> 00:53:55,639
So if, like, you guys want to chat and maybe Chris, Jennifer and Sarah and you,

497
00:53:55,640 --> 00:54:07,540
and because you three can go together and I'm trying to recruit you guys in threes, you guys three and then you guys three that and then you.

498
00:54:07,550 --> 00:54:12,470
Oh, wow. We're like multiples of free. Okay, so, Emily, do either of these two behind you and another.

499
00:54:14,330 --> 00:54:32,330
Okay, perfect. So, I don't know, but why don't we take, like, I don't know, ten minute camel sounds going in the room and just, you know,

500
00:54:32,870 --> 00:54:38,930
think about just, you know, either all of them you can think about social contextual factors or one in particular.

501
00:54:39,350 --> 00:54:45,800
And then when in development would that be helpful to have and why?

502
00:54:45,830 --> 00:54:52,159
And then we can share back to the bigger class and let you know actors that people

503
00:54:52,160 --> 00:55:05,120
have questions and I guess like we're out of a company like now there's this one.

504
00:55:05,660 --> 00:55:24,820
I don't know, I, I was, you know, I really thought I was like, oh, I don't think so.

505
00:55:27,830 --> 00:55:31,580
Other yeah.

506
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:45,230
Like I want to be like, I can do whatever I feel like.

507
00:55:46,640 --> 00:56:00,720
Yeah. But I think then I feel like I know I actually, I know it's risky to try another girl.

508
00:56:00,770 --> 00:56:04,610
I was like, no, you don't like.

509
00:56:05,090 --> 00:56:12,760
I just like to be less of right for, like, a social, which is.

510
00:56:17,530 --> 00:56:21,250
Probably. I don't quite understand.

511
00:56:23,220 --> 00:56:30,470
Right? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

512
00:56:31,350 --> 00:56:34,440
Just like I don't think you can.

513
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:38,970
Yeah, I just got in here.

514
00:56:42,320 --> 00:57:13,040
Yeah. Like I was like, yeah, I mean, like, I like I like house and like I was like, oh, yeah, like, what do you like?

515
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:23,140
Yeah. Yeah.

516
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:33,260
Yeah, right. Or, you know. If anything, external factors.

517
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:42,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

518
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:48,280
I mean they haven't even if they're really.

519
00:57:49,270 --> 00:58:03,960
Yeah I guess I think, I mean I definitely think they are so big that they.

520
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:11,170
And I'm sure there is more.

521
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:21,790
I feel like I really on either of that.

522
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:34,180
I like it even higher than the other.

523
00:58:35,910 --> 00:58:48,660
Yeah, yeah. It's really easy. Like for like people like you.

524
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:51,830
Like how they like. Yeah. No, I think.

525
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:58,330
I think we. Was.

526
00:59:03,850 --> 00:59:14,160
Like myself or my girl, you know, I want to drive and I get a lot of Internet.

527
00:59:14,230 --> 00:59:32,420
Yeah. I'm glad I'm prepared for something like that.

528
00:59:33,310 --> 00:59:56,090
Like when I was just wondering, it doesn't feel like they feel like they're like here is like all in relation to somebody that I carried out with.

529
00:59:56,300 --> 01:00:01,440
Like, I don't know. I feel like. Like.

530
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:06,750
$100.

531
01:00:07,130 --> 01:00:24,320
200. We're going to hear exactly what people have to look like with an actual.

532
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:32,480
I thought it was like I was like, you know, if I was going to like.

533
01:00:41,420 --> 01:00:48,470
Yeah. Another factor that I don't think I.

534
01:00:52,370 --> 01:00:59,340
God knows it's pretty much like that.

535
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:03,930
I feel like the other three, it was like, Oh yeah.

536
01:01:07,750 --> 01:01:15,560
I'd like to. I think.

537
01:01:16,410 --> 01:01:25,050
I mean. Ideally, I would love to be involved in another.

538
01:01:36,580 --> 01:01:52,350
You know, like for like like grocery stores or something like that.

539
01:01:52,350 --> 01:02:00,040
I mean, like, really like my six year old daughter.

540
01:02:00,470 --> 01:02:09,090
I feel like I throw all. Verses like this because I'm very young, really quiet about it.

541
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:16,200
I feel like even others that I know that I love. Heartbreaking for.

542
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:27,890
But then actually my little sister was going to be a mother and I was like, now.

543
01:02:38,770 --> 01:02:49,220
You look like you're going to have to figure out.

544
01:02:50,750 --> 01:02:55,930
Right here, right now is the phone.

545
01:02:57,730 --> 01:03:01,380
You get the information you need to reach them in a hurry.

546
01:03:01,590 --> 01:03:18,770
Like if you're like me, you talk talked about in classes or like you have to think about the title of the one that everyone has.

547
01:03:22,060 --> 01:03:31,180
I think they want to hurt you, but I feel like you have to give them.

548
01:03:32,550 --> 01:03:38,040
We've heard the important thing like what you said about the.

549
01:03:45,250 --> 01:03:52,120
Before you went to Paris, you heard about his grandmother making a recovery.

550
01:03:53,800 --> 01:04:00,160
I don't know why this matters so much.

551
01:04:01,150 --> 01:04:05,230
Are you all right?

552
01:04:05,770 --> 01:04:30,470
I'm really, really sorry about earlier this year, but anything know you feel like you and me.

553
01:04:32,900 --> 01:04:50,450
We haven't made it of with.

554
01:04:52,450 --> 01:05:07,290
Really like. I think if you go to something like that kind of hard.

555
01:05:13,940 --> 01:05:17,900
Don't know what it was about old.

556
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:30,870
There's nothing you can do. I know where I look like I know what you're talking about.

557
01:05:31,420 --> 01:05:36,860
None of that is going of them.

558
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:43,220
Gray from outside after the meeting that they had.

559
01:05:43,230 --> 01:05:52,170
It's really, really, really embarrassing for the reality that like the spirit and I think that was that week.

560
01:05:52,360 --> 01:06:07,860
Yeah, exactly. I like China, for example, like being in and other countries like other parts of the world is like.

561
01:06:10,250 --> 01:06:21,200
You could really be one of those, I believe 100 and know one is not going to sit.

562
01:06:23,750 --> 01:06:50,660
I know. I feel like this is one thing and it's just like will be like any other time.

563
01:06:53,280 --> 01:07:01,740
About like infrastructure regarding the water.

564
01:07:03,850 --> 01:07:18,330
The older. My concern is whether they will ever be off my skin.

565
01:07:19,650 --> 01:07:39,420
I. I had inside your head something like the apple or apple and they have those we don't want even.

566
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:45,090
I love something like, you know, peanut butter something.

567
01:07:45,220 --> 01:08:06,430
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

568
01:08:07,620 --> 01:08:25,060
Okay, I'm going to. I love this.

569
01:08:26,690 --> 01:08:34,150
This is the one I don't like. Oh, sorry. This is not something I signed up for.

570
01:08:37,450 --> 01:08:40,720
Something that goes something like this.

571
01:08:40,730 --> 01:08:57,630
Like, I don't know about this. I don't. Actually, I was thinking I was like, all right.

572
01:08:58,720 --> 01:09:06,830
I had to. Yeah.

573
01:09:13,100 --> 01:09:16,120
I mean, I like.

574
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:24,790
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Because it's like once that. And I feel like that's the thing.

575
01:09:24,850 --> 01:09:28,280
I don't think. Absolutely fascinating.

576
01:09:33,530 --> 01:09:41,260
When it comes to raising money, you don't know the bad the unemployment.

577
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:49,910
I like. Exactly like that.

578
01:09:50,690 --> 01:09:57,770
I mean, it's something wrong with that. Okay, guys, it's like 1240 oh oh.

579
01:09:57,830 --> 01:10:02,160
So I'm psyched that everybody had a lot to chat about.

580
01:10:02,530 --> 01:10:08,300
Yeah. And I talked to the few few groups and it sounds like there's some good ideas.

581
01:10:08,310 --> 01:10:15,060
Anybody particularly want to share something their group came up with that you guys talked about that seemed like,

582
01:10:15,930 --> 01:10:22,410
you know, a cool novel intervention idea or an important social context that we haven't talked about.

583
01:10:24,090 --> 01:10:31,590
So you sat down and it was kind of just to hear, um, yeah, really cool.

584
01:10:31,630 --> 01:10:42,400
Now about one thing we talked about was I think especially in like middle school years, high school your like time where that like part of, you know,

585
01:10:42,410 --> 01:10:52,740
people we looked at and also like know disorders if you just like talking about like not pushing the restrictive narrative,

586
01:10:52,770 --> 01:11:00,899
you know that can also have negative effects on like kids metabolisms and just like development.

587
01:11:00,900 --> 01:11:11,200
So thinking about like adding things. So instead of like you need to use less or less like our human hearts and stuff like that

588
01:11:11,230 --> 01:11:18,670
belly adding more and more foods and just like thank you were saying on a colorful plate,

589
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:24,250
having that kind of approach rather than like shaming and restricting.

590
01:11:26,300 --> 01:11:36,920
Especially right if we could shift that like early adolescence time, you know, in terms of what, you know, what peers are doing, what you know,

591
01:11:37,010 --> 01:11:44,090
what we can be promoting about instead of restrictive about because they're so primed for shame and stigma and also following peers.

592
01:11:45,110 --> 01:11:49,630
So that's a really powerful intervention context that, you know,

593
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:56,600
I think we'll talk a little bit in the adolescence part about there is an intervention that that eating

594
01:11:56,750 --> 01:12:04,250
eating researchers did that they basically had their kids write about like like the man like in terms of

595
01:12:04,250 --> 01:12:09,500
the food industry and sort of saying like the food industry is like after you eat all these foods that

596
01:12:09,500 --> 01:12:14,540
are bad for you and that are impeding your ability to function and like get angry at the food industry.

597
01:12:14,540 --> 01:12:18,650
And then that sort of actually worked for in a lab context.

598
01:12:19,070 --> 01:12:23,600
They then chose healthier food like after they did that writing intervention and they thought that was cool.

599
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:30,620
And it was an example of like harnessing the adolescent brains because it's very motivating, right?

600
01:12:30,620 --> 01:12:39,640
So yeah, cool. So adolescence and eating and shame and stigma and then anybody else have a different like age group or topic that they talked about.

601
01:12:42,740 --> 01:12:52,910
We talked about hellofresh for baby bottles, like providing, you know, kind of materials to parents that might be immediately usable,

602
01:12:52,910 --> 01:13:00,770
that could sort of break down some of those barriers and that are not always expensive depending like you could partner with different,

603
01:13:01,010 --> 01:13:04,200
you know, constituencies and. Get those things.

604
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:09,080
Done. Other topics.

605
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:16,470
Before discussing, chuckling.

606
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:27,329
I mean, we talked about like a bunch of different things. The last thing we talked about was the breastfeeding and how there is like micro plastics

607
01:13:27,330 --> 01:13:32,760
being found right now and how like even if you promote something that is beneficial,

608
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:44,879
how that can even have something negative, an outcome. And yes, and I don't know, I, I can't remember today.

609
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:47,190
I might have sent it to you guys when we talked about baby food,

610
01:13:47,190 --> 01:13:55,319
but there is this study that just was done on like fetal response to different maternal diets taste and like they had this

611
01:13:55,320 --> 01:14:05,040
image from the article that was a fetus who had had whose parent had eaten kale compared to eating something sweet and like,

612
01:14:05,700 --> 01:14:11,669
you know, in emotions, literature like disgust is like a primary emotion because it's so and evolutionarily

613
01:14:11,670 --> 01:14:15,240
adaptive to be like disgusted by things that taste bitter because they're often poisonous.

614
01:14:15,990 --> 01:14:22,709
And this fetus expression was like, that was a classic disgust face with like pulled up lips and you just go,

615
01:14:22,710 --> 01:14:29,910
oh, my gosh, like from the beginning, it's like the pretty beginning, like how those things get acquired.

616
01:14:29,910 --> 01:14:36,360
And so are you. You know, you could probably desensitize your fetus to eating kale if you had it every single day.

617
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:40,920
And like that probably be great. And but it's like overcoming this disgust barrier.

618
01:14:41,580 --> 01:14:46,350
And then what what else is in your environmental context?

619
01:14:46,350 --> 01:14:51,120
Like, are there microbeads? Yeah, there there probably are microbeads in everybody's breast milk at this point.

620
01:14:51,120 --> 01:15:00,030
So what does that mean? So, yeah, so so not once not a not a simple solution, but that's a good point.

621
01:15:01,050 --> 01:15:06,750
And then we have formula shortages, on the other hand. So, you know, as often, you know, we're talking about harm reduction.

622
01:15:06,750 --> 01:15:10,590
So other other ideas.

623
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:15,660
Yeah, we had a conversation about apples in springtime.

624
01:15:16,290 --> 01:15:26,199
Yeah. Yeah. The we were talking about kind of like kind of like decision making, but like also how like things are prepared, like getting an apple.

625
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:29,710
And we also talked about like what is the red apple calling the red delicious?

626
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:35,270
And it's like in every scrap, you know, the cheapest.

627
01:15:35,340 --> 01:15:40,260
Yeah. And we were comparing it to like other apples are like those cut up and okay,

628
01:15:40,350 --> 01:15:46,020
I know peanut butter is an issue in school where like if it was cut up and it had peanut butter, I'd be more likely to choose that.

629
01:15:46,020 --> 01:15:50,700
So like thinking about to how like in adolescence how like decision making process like in the brain

630
01:15:50,700 --> 01:15:56,070
is still like is still maturing at that stage and like being introduced to different stressors.

631
01:15:56,550 --> 01:16:06,840
Um, so thinking about like how you can change like food presentations and like preparation to kind of help aid in the decision making process.

632
01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:12,280
Mm hmm. Absolutely. And that's one of those ideas around, you know.

633
01:16:12,330 --> 01:16:20,309
Yeah, like repackaging like and tag teaming with, like, food marketer people to try to package things in a more appealing manner.

634
01:16:20,310 --> 01:16:24,870
And they've tried this with like mini carrots. And again, we're still sort of we're working against that like kale.

635
01:16:24,870 --> 01:16:31,920
People disgust face because cookies will always be more it's either easy or they're more palatable.

636
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:36,930
But can we like work to overcome that in a more proactive way?

637
01:16:36,930 --> 01:16:42,299
So, yeah, absolutely. Good one. Um, let's see.

638
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:50,280
I know we just got a few minutes. I wanted to one of I, I have other info, but let me, I'll flip to this.

639
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:57,059
This is an important again for people who are really interested in this area. This is the CDC like Nutrition and Physical Activity Group,

640
01:16:57,060 --> 01:17:03,360
and they're doing some really cool work on childhood obesity prevention and they have for a long time,

641
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:11,640
but they're sort of pulling it together in a way that I think is a great kind of holistic way to think about this.

642
01:17:12,060 --> 01:17:15,900
And so these are some of the things they're sort of recommending from that universal

643
01:17:15,900 --> 01:17:22,500
like bottom of the pyramid type of approaches to the more treatment at the church,

644
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:26,790
you know, tertiary care kind of thing. And if you'll, you know, these are all very broad.

645
01:17:26,790 --> 01:17:31,650
So it's like working with billing for reimbursement for treatment.

646
01:17:32,850 --> 01:17:35,729
But then also these are sort of broad in the public health space.

647
01:17:35,730 --> 01:17:40,590
So I just put that up as a resource and then I wanted to just show you guys, this is a model.

648
01:17:40,890 --> 01:17:43,170
This is probably some of the stuff you guys talked about.

649
01:17:43,170 --> 01:17:48,180
But this is another if you're thinking about especially people who are doing obesity prevention for

650
01:17:48,180 --> 01:17:53,480
your papers like this might be good information to sort of think about like this is the contents.

651
01:17:53,500 --> 01:17:58,229
These are kind of like the behaviors that we were talking about, the context, how we have to think about it.

652
01:17:58,230 --> 01:18:02,760
And then this is kind of where your papers might end up in terms of the intervention paper,

653
01:18:03,690 --> 01:18:09,329
how much dosage, what, you know, kind of delivery format, you know, what age, what setting.

654
01:18:09,330 --> 01:18:10,290
And so this is a good.

655
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:17,940
To kind of think about like, here's my obesity example, here's my developmental context paper, and then like, here's my intervention paper.

656
01:18:17,940 --> 01:18:23,190
We're actually like trying to think through what the heck am I going to do or recommend?

657
01:18:24,120 --> 01:18:30,750
So that's another resource. And then I just wanted to, uh, this is more on the, the, the childhood obesity work.

658
01:18:32,280 --> 01:18:36,690
This is an example of like a parent facing communication about obesity.

659
01:18:36,990 --> 01:18:40,709
And I think, you know, we can reflect is this helpful?

660
01:18:40,710 --> 01:18:46,170
Is this too much? You know, is it appealing, is it blaming?

661
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:53,250
So just sort of thinking about like our materials in this space, in particular in this obesity space is really critical.

662
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:57,180
And then the other thing I'll just leave us with a little bit of good news.

663
01:18:58,470 --> 01:19:02,850
On average, childhood obesity is more responsive to treatment than adult obesity.

664
01:19:02,850 --> 01:19:09,540
So even if it feels really hard, it's a worthy goal to try to get in there in the childhood space.

665
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:17,820
