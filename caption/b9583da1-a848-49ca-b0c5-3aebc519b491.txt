1
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:04,990
This recording is on probabilities and models.

2
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:06,191
So what is modeling?

3
00:00:06,191 --> 00:00:08,681
Well we're not talking about the modeling that Tyra Banks might do.

4
00:00:08,681 --> 00:00:14,170
We're talking about mathematical modeling using decision trees and Markov models.

5
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:18,240
These are typical models that were used for cost effectiveness analysis.

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,953
So modeling is the development and

7
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:23,681
analysis of mathematical models can provide useful inputs to questions.

8
00:00:23,681 --> 00:00:27,480
And so I say useful input is the model is providing us information that

9
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,441
can be valuable for answering some sort of question.

10
00:00:30,441 --> 00:00:32,427
And usually in our case this is a policy question,

11
00:00:32,427 --> 00:00:33,960
we want to find some sort of solution.

12
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:40,140
And the model is one type of input that we can use to help us answer the question.

13
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,785
Nice thing about mathematical models in my opinion are that it keeps explicit

14
00:00:44,785 --> 00:00:47,511
assumptions and explicit value judgments.

15
00:00:47,511 --> 00:00:52,084
So what I mean by assumptions or things like how effective is my intervention and

16
00:00:52,084 --> 00:00:53,740
explicit value judgments?

17
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:57,601
Like how much do is a surgery Cost?

18
00:00:57,601 --> 00:01:01,340
That's a value judgment, it costs $10,000.

19
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,870
What's the quality of life with emphysema?

20
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:07,749
It's 8 these are very explicit, you can disagree with them, but

21
00:01:07,749 --> 00:01:11,720
at least in the model they are explicit, there should be explicit.

22
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:15,481
So I'm trying to find the solution to the problem.

23
00:01:15,481 --> 00:01:17,730
We have some sort of problem, we have some sort of objective.

24
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:20,846
Usually in our case with cost effectiveness analysis,

25
00:01:20,846 --> 00:01:23,250
we want to look at costs and health status.

26
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:28,628
And in order to figure out what the impact of our solutions on the objective are we

27
00:01:28,628 --> 00:01:34,085
want to first of all develop different alternatives, so decide what we can do and

28
00:01:34,085 --> 00:01:38,450
usually want to think about, 3-7 different alternatives.

29
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:43,331
And then we conduct some sort of analysis and this is where the mathematical

30
00:01:43,331 --> 00:01:47,593
modeling comes in is we do this analysis to figure out exactly what

31
00:01:47,593 --> 00:01:52,190
objectives do we think will result from our different alternatives.

32
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:57,052
And we can also conduct sensitivity analysis to see how those assumptions and

33
00:01:57,052 --> 00:02:00,792
value judgments, how our choices of those assumptions and

34
00:02:00,792 --> 00:02:04,631
value judgments can potentially change our alternatives.

35
00:02:04,631 --> 00:02:06,740
Impact on the objective.

36
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:11,581
Keep in mind that mathematical modeling is only going to be able to it's

37
00:02:11,581 --> 00:02:14,100
mathematical, it's new miracle.

38
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,815
So it's going to quantify things and

39
00:02:15,815 --> 00:02:19,490
keep in mind that there are many non quantifiable factors to consider as well.

40
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:23,367
So these models are not going to keep that in consideration, like the ethics or

41
00:02:23,367 --> 00:02:26,340
legality or fairness of certain interventions.

42
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,700
So what does the decision tree look like?

43
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,421
First we have some sort of rectangular boxes.

44
00:02:32,421 --> 00:02:34,740
These represent our decisions.

45
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:38,935
In this case we'll go do a simple investment decision emanating out of that

46
00:02:38,935 --> 00:02:42,141
box or some arms or lines, those represent our choices.

47
00:02:42,141 --> 00:02:43,651
And this is a very simple example.

48
00:02:43,651 --> 00:02:46,761
We only have two choices we can either invest or not invest.

49
00:02:46,761 --> 00:02:50,589
But you can imagine a lot of different decisions having more arms emanating out

50
00:02:50,589 --> 00:02:53,340
of them like different levels of investment.

51
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,937
In this example we have circles circle in this case represents the success of our

52
00:02:56,937 --> 00:02:59,941
investments or maybe we're going to invest in the stock market and

53
00:02:59,941 --> 00:03:02,540
you can either be successful or not successful.

54
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:06,943
The circle represents the uncertainty and the arms emanating out of it represents

55
00:03:06,943 --> 00:03:09,571
the potential resolution of that uncertainty.

56
00:03:09,571 --> 00:03:12,321
So we might find that our investment is successful.

57
00:03:12,321 --> 00:03:15,050
Yes it's successful or no it's not successful.

58
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:17,640
So those are outcomes that we might see.

59
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,367
And you see notice next to the arms emanating

60
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:24,801
out of the circle we see some p and 1-p.

61
00:03:24,801 --> 00:03:29,571
So those were the probabilities of those different outcomes happening from that

62
00:03:29,571 --> 00:03:30,491
uncertainty.

63
00:03:30,491 --> 00:03:35,234
And so those are those should add up to 100%, with 100% certainty,

64
00:03:35,234 --> 00:03:36,810
something must happen.

65
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:38,411
And so in this example it's very simple.

66
00:03:38,411 --> 00:03:44,840
We just have to alternatives so the probabilities are p and 1-p.

67
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:49,657
Also in a decision tree we have to quantify the value of the outcomes at

68
00:03:49,657 --> 00:03:51,411
the very end of the tree.

69
00:03:51,411 --> 00:03:55,700
So in this case of this investment decision we might have some sort of medium

70
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:56,731
amount of money.

71
00:03:56,731 --> 00:04:00,480
If we don't invest, we maybe get a large amount of money if we invest in it

72
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,844
successful and if we invest in it's not successful, we're left with a small amount

73
00:04:04,844 --> 00:04:07,871
of money and presumably here we prefer more money to less.

74
00:04:07,871 --> 00:04:09,931
And so it's this might be a difficult decision.

75
00:04:09,931 --> 00:04:12,563
If we don't invest, we have that medium pile of money,

76
00:04:12,563 --> 00:04:15,307
we could get a bigger pile of money if we're successful but

77
00:04:15,307 --> 00:04:17,951
we get a smaller pile of money if we're not successful.

78
00:04:17,951 --> 00:04:19,865
And so this is a difficult decision,

79
00:04:19,865 --> 00:04:23,521
so let's look at this decision may be from a health care perspective.

80
00:04:23,521 --> 00:04:28,273
So we might have a health care problem where we will vaccinate and

81
00:04:28,273 --> 00:04:30,651
maybe hear similar structure.

82
00:04:30,651 --> 00:04:32,320
We can choose to vaccinate or not.

83
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,251
And maybe if we don't vaccinate, someone could become infected with probability p.

84
00:04:36,251 --> 00:04:40,480
And and we're not become infected with probability 1-p.

85
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,273
And then here instead of just having dollars at the end of the tree,

86
00:04:44,273 --> 00:04:46,791
we might have dollars and health outcomes.

87
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:51,226
So here if we don't if we do vaccinate, we had to spend some money on the vaccine so

88
00:04:51,226 --> 00:04:54,520
we don't have the biggest pile of money but we are healthy.

89
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:59,931
The best outcome actually sorry, we spent a medium amount of money.

90
00:04:59,931 --> 00:05:05,570
These are dollars spent so we spent a medium amount of money on vaccination.

91
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:08,362
If we look at the bottom arm of the tree here,

92
00:05:08,362 --> 00:05:13,044
the best outcome is we didn't vaccinate and we didn't get infected and so

93
00:05:13,044 --> 00:05:16,850
we didn't spend very much money and we're still healthy.

94
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:19,981
Of course if you don't vaccinate, you could potentially get the worst outcome.

95
00:05:19,981 --> 00:05:25,781
And that's the middle one here where maybe we got infected and then disease.

96
00:05:25,781 --> 00:05:28,710
And so we have the worst health and probably the highest costs.

97
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:31,590
So this is the example of the decision tree

98
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:34,481
with looking at health care here really.

99
00:05:34,481 --> 00:05:37,531
The difference is the dollar amounts represent costs.

100
00:05:37,531 --> 00:05:40,531
But we also at the very end of the tree also have health outcomes.

101
00:05:40,531 --> 00:05:43,767
Because we're looking at cost effectiveness analysis, we're looking at

102
00:05:43,767 --> 00:05:46,940
things along two dimensions, not just costs but also health outcomes.

103
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:50,104
Now what we do with these decision trees is we want

104
00:05:50,104 --> 00:05:54,990
to calculate an expected value or something called a certain equivalent.

105
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:59,642
So remember here is a simple decision tree here we have a decision,

106
00:05:59,642 --> 00:06:02,490
we can make a couple different choices.

107
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:06,612
And with this we have some uncertainty of what might happen and

108
00:06:06,612 --> 00:06:08,930
maybe we have outcomes a, b and c.

109
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:13,383
With choice to the uncertain outcome be as probability of p and

110
00:06:13,383 --> 00:06:15,961
c happens with probability 1-p.

111
00:06:15,961 --> 00:06:19,665
So the question is well how do we think about choice to with that uncertain

112
00:06:19,665 --> 00:06:20,221
outcome?

113
00:06:20,221 --> 00:06:23,840
And what we do with these decision trees is calculate and expected value.

114
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:29,230
And what that is is the there were this otherwise known as a certain

115
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:34,730
equivalent is we multiply the probabilities times the outcomes.

116
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:38,668
So you remember we had probability p of be happening and

117
00:06:38,668 --> 00:06:41,510
we had probably 1 -2 of c happening.

118
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:45,140
So we just multiply the probabilities at times the outcomes.

119
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:49,840
And that's what we that's how we get our expected value or certain equivalent.

120
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:54,138
And then the next part we we do with these decision trees is make a choice so

121
00:06:54,138 --> 00:06:56,760
which value or certain equivalent is best.

122
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:01,733
So remember in this decision tree we have either choice one we get a and

123
00:07:01,733 --> 00:07:05,351
choice to are expected value is pb+(1-p)c.

124
00:07:05,351 --> 00:07:11,720
So then the next part of the choices should be relatively simple.

125
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:15,981
I want to ask which value is better, is it a or is it pb+(1-p)c.

126
00:07:15,981 --> 00:07:24,271
And so that's how we make our choice.

127
00:07:24,271 --> 00:07:27,422
We, so with uncertainties we calculate that the expected value of certain

128
00:07:27,422 --> 00:07:29,981
equivalent and then we make a choice between which are more.

129
00:07:29,981 --> 00:07:34,440
No decision has the highest expected value.

130
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:37,250
So that's how we calculate those outcomes.

131
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:40,941
So why do we use decision analysis while we're weighing risks and benefits?

132
00:07:40,941 --> 00:07:43,504
We're trying to tie together different sources of evidence and

133
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:45,180
we're exploring longer term outcomes.

134
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:49,922
So weighing risks and benefits, I'd like to think about our policy analysis is

135
00:07:49,922 --> 00:07:52,631
doing something we call balanced tree here.

136
00:07:52,631 --> 00:07:55,240
So maybe we have a policy decision to vaccinate.

137
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,761
And when I say balance, we want to consider both the risks and the benefits.

138
00:07:58,761 --> 00:08:03,140
So our our vaccination here, maybe we might have adverse events happening.

139
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:07,690
Maybe someone gets infected, maybe they visit the doctor if they do get infected,

140
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:09,270
maybe to go to the hospital.

141
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:13,300
And so when I say balanced again here, we're weighing the risks.

142
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:16,347
So maybe we have some sort of probability of adverse event and

143
00:08:16,347 --> 00:08:18,511
the benefits here maybe were vaccinated.

144
00:08:18,511 --> 00:08:20,881
We have a lower chance of becoming infected.

145
00:08:20,881 --> 00:08:23,000
And then if we were at the bottom part of the tree,

146
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,440
just getting supportive care without vaccination.

147
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:31,340
So your decision tree can incorporate both those risks and benefits.

148
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:34,500
The decision trees can also tie together different sources of evidence.

149
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:38,750
So you might have, you might not have all the information you need from one study.

150
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:41,356
But what you can do with the decision tree is tied together different

151
00:08:41,356 --> 00:08:42,231
sources of evidence.

152
00:08:42,231 --> 00:08:42,784
So maybe,

153
00:08:42,784 --> 00:08:46,730
you have some sort of data from the vaccine adverse event reporting system.

154
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:50,828
You could use that to plug in your vaccine, your likelihood of vaccine

155
00:08:50,828 --> 00:08:55,342
adverse events and your decision tree maybe study to was the clinical trial in

156
00:08:55,342 --> 00:08:59,300
the vaccine that has very precise estimates of vaccine infection or

157
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,960
infection risk reduction with the vaccine.

158
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,900
Maybe study three tells you the general infection risk,

159
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:07,980
maybe some sort of study of this disease in the population.

160
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:12,758
And then maybe have another store study which has information on how often people

161
00:09:12,758 --> 00:09:15,007
go to the doctor or hospital visits and

162
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:19,110
maybe of other studies on the cost of hospitalizations and so forth.

163
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:23,294
So you can tie together different sources of evidence, different data sources or

164
00:09:23,294 --> 00:09:27,173
studies to put paint a more complete picture of what the total outcome of your

165
00:09:27,173 --> 00:09:28,810
intervention might be.

166
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:34,140
We also want to consider the time horizon and keep in mind that the benefits and

167
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:38,340
costs of your intervention might be occurring over time.

168
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:42,652
And depending on when you choose the endpoint for your analysis, you may or

169
00:09:42,652 --> 00:09:47,260
may not be including all the relevant benefits and costs of your intervention.

170
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:51,400
So in this case we may want to extend our time horizon of our analysis to make sure

171
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,750
we incorporate all the benefits and costs.

172
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:56,065
Of course, the longer you do your time horizon,

173
00:09:56,065 --> 00:09:58,640
the more work it is to do your analysis them.

174
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,171
So here's a simple example maybe of survival with some sort of disease.

175
00:10:03,171 --> 00:10:07,483
Maybe we've got the current policy is the red line survival over time the green line

176
00:10:07,483 --> 00:10:09,091
is survival with a new policy.

177
00:10:09,091 --> 00:10:12,384
So you can have better survival over these three years and

178
00:10:12,384 --> 00:10:14,940
the gain is the area kind of in between here?

179
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:18,540
How much better is the new policy than the current policy?

180
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,982
Now, if we chose a short time horizon,

181
00:10:20,982 --> 00:10:25,290
we would only capture a tiny sliver of this gain and health outcomes.

182
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:30,116
But if we went out the let's say three years here would capture a more complete

183
00:10:30,116 --> 00:10:33,321
picture of the of the gain from this intervention.

184
00:10:33,321 --> 00:10:37,129
So you can see the time horizon here might be important and

185
00:10:37,129 --> 00:10:40,951
it might be important to model out the full time horizon.

186
00:10:40,951 --> 00:10:44,668
When I say full time horizon, maybe there's a study that looked at the game

187
00:10:44,668 --> 00:10:47,621
and that study maybe only looked three years in the future.

188
00:10:47,621 --> 00:10:50,865
And at the end of the, at the end of three years, there were more people alive with

189
00:10:50,865 --> 00:10:52,970
the intervention than without the intervention.

190
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:57,196
The question then is if you actually did this intervention in the real world,

191
00:10:57,196 --> 00:10:58,840
people, might live longer.

192
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:02,242
So you could do an analysis just looking at the first three years and

193
00:11:02,242 --> 00:11:05,610
that might be just looking at the outcomes from within the trial.

194
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:08,864
But that's kind of like assuming that everyone dies immediately after

195
00:11:08,864 --> 00:11:09,521
three years.

196
00:11:09,521 --> 00:11:12,536
If you ignore all the outcomes after three years, But

197
00:11:12,536 --> 00:11:15,151
in the real world, people might live longer.

198
00:11:15,151 --> 00:11:18,797
And so if there are more people alive at the end of three years,

199
00:11:18,797 --> 00:11:22,540
they might have more years of life to live beyond three years.

200
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:27,061
And so with a mathematical model, you can explore different hypothetical outcome.

201
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:31,852
So maybe some sort of, you could simulate no further benefit, you could

202
00:11:31,852 --> 00:11:36,350
simulate some sort of continuation of benefit beyond three years.

203
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:38,808
There are a lot of different assumptions you can make and

204
00:11:38,808 --> 00:11:42,259
you could explore how those different assumptions might affect your policy,

205
00:11:42,259 --> 00:11:43,850
your overall policy conclusions.

206
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:48,272
But with mathematical models, you can explore these types of things about what

207
00:11:48,272 --> 00:11:50,321
happens further on into the future.

208
00:11:50,321 --> 00:11:56,175
And you can explore different time horizons and what frequently used tool for

209
00:11:56,175 --> 00:12:00,440
exploring long term outcomes is the Markov Model.

210
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03,170
So here's an example of a decision tree.

211
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:07,140
We can either choose to vaccinate or not.

212
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:11,937
But we might think about if we don't vaccinate as something happening

213
00:12:11,937 --> 00:12:13,491
any particular year.

214
00:12:13,491 --> 00:12:16,961
So maybe I get the HPV vaccine, for example,

215
00:12:16,961 --> 00:12:21,526
it might take me several years from for me to get infected and

216
00:12:21,526 --> 00:12:25,640
each year I live I have additional exposure to risk.

217
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:29,912
And so what you could do is kind of continue your decision tree on and on and

218
00:12:29,912 --> 00:12:34,210
on and say infected year one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

219
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:36,250
So we could kind of repeat this.

220
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:41,129
This uncertainty of getting infected in years one, two, three, four, five,

221
00:12:41,129 --> 00:12:45,788
six, seven and on what we can kind of, this is kind of a messy tree though and so

222
00:12:45,788 --> 00:12:50,884
we can use this tool called a Markov Model that's sometimes easier to think about and

223
00:12:50,884 --> 00:12:52,240
deal with.

224
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,595
And so what we do with the Markov model is we divide the world up into

225
00:12:55,595 --> 00:12:58,901
mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive health state.

226
00:12:58,901 --> 00:13:04,140
So here, we'll make a simple example of someone being either healthy or disease.

227
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:08,349
Each one of these circles represents those health states, and then lines between

228
00:13:08,349 --> 00:13:12,741
the circles with arrows here represent the possible transitions in any time period.

229
00:13:12,741 --> 00:13:15,756
So maybe every year if I'm healthy,

230
00:13:15,756 --> 00:13:20,640
I have the chance of becoming diseased with probability p.

231
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:25,706
So you see the arm emanating from the top here from healthy to diseased,

232
00:13:25,706 --> 00:13:30,790
and p is the probability of becoming diseased and with probably 1-p.

233
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:34,742
I looped back and I stay healthy now here, if I'm diseased,

234
00:13:34,742 --> 00:13:39,549
I have probably q of recovering, so going from disease back to healthy and

235
00:13:39,549 --> 00:13:42,060
probably 1-q of staying diseased.

236
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:46,330
And once we define the potential health states and the transitions between

237
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:52,240
the health states, we can simulate what the long term outcomes might look like.

238
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,067
So for example,

239
00:13:53,067 --> 00:13:57,280
we could have a simple example of some horrible disease affecting 1000 people.

240
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:01,025
20 die each year and so we could say in time period one,

241
00:14:01,025 --> 00:14:05,280
everyone's alive, but in time Period to 200 have died.

242
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:09,061
And in time period three an additional 100 and 60 people have died and so forth.

243
00:14:09,061 --> 00:14:12,919
So you can simulate with that 20% mortality each year,

244
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:18,681
how many people will be alive after 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 up to 10 years in the future.

245
00:14:18,681 --> 00:14:21,794
And here we can simulate the long term outcomes with that very

246
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:24,540
simple Markov model.

247
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:27,773
So when you're doing this modeling is some things to

248
00:14:27,773 --> 00:14:30,711
consider are tying intermediate results to for

249
00:14:30,711 --> 00:14:34,620
any models tying intermediate results to the final outcomes.

250
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:39,363
So intermediate results might be some sort of intermediate health states

251
00:14:39,363 --> 00:14:43,570
like pre infection exposure, could be early stages of disease,

252
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:49,153
could be high cholesterol, which would be an intermediate result to a final outcome,

253
00:14:49,153 --> 00:14:51,540
which might be a heart attack.

254
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:55,329
And then Markov models here again, we define those mutually exclusive,

255
00:14:55,329 --> 00:14:57,225
collectively exhaustive states and

256
00:14:57,225 --> 00:15:00,120
also might want to think about degrees of distinction.

257
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,970
So what distinctions do we want to make?

258
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:08,921
When we do this modeling, we want to get outcomes we care about.

259
00:15:08,921 --> 00:15:10,472
So we might know certain things and

260
00:15:10,472 --> 00:15:13,700
a model is going to help us try to translate that into what we care about.

261
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:16,700
So maybe we know things like vaccine efficacy,

262
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:20,975
population attack rate with this disease symptom quality of life,

263
00:15:20,975 --> 00:15:25,420
health related quality of life and maybe the disease mortality rate.

264
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:29,564
And in the end, what we care about is the morbidity and mortality or

265
00:15:29,564 --> 00:15:32,311
the quality adjusted life years from this.

266
00:15:32,311 --> 00:15:37,124
So maybe vaccine efficacy affects population attack rate, population attack

267
00:15:37,124 --> 00:15:41,890
rate and disease mortality affects mortality, symptoms affect morbidity.

268
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:46,112
So all these things kind of tied together to give us the quality adjusted life years

269
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:48,340
that we care about.

270
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:50,557
When we're thinking about these health states,

271
00:15:50,557 --> 00:15:53,731
we want to think about I want to make sure they're mutually exclusive.

272
00:15:53,731 --> 00:15:55,999
So someone fits in only one bucket and

273
00:15:55,999 --> 00:16:00,190
collectively exhausted saying that we have a bucket for everyone.

274
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:03,100
And so we want to we could potentially in this example,

275
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:06,281
think about maybe health states and intervention states.

276
00:16:06,281 --> 00:16:11,220
So maybe here we could have four buckets here.

277
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:15,243
You could either be not infected on the left hand side and

278
00:16:15,243 --> 00:16:17,670
infected on the right hand side.

279
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:22,060
And intervention states being not treated on the top and treated on the bottom.

280
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:25,962
So here we might have four Simple health states here about in fact that

281
00:16:25,962 --> 00:16:28,601
are not infected and treated and not treated.

282
00:16:28,601 --> 00:16:31,821
And that gives us a combination of four different health states.

283
00:16:31,821 --> 00:16:35,685
And you could move between those two dependent on infection rates,

284
00:16:35,685 --> 00:16:40,159
whether you're treated or not treated and rates at which you become treated,

285
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:43,440
perhaps dependent upon your infection status.

286
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:48,282
So again at the at the end here we're trying to find some analyze the problem,

287
00:16:48,282 --> 00:16:53,201
evaluate different alternatives and find some sort of objective our costs and

288
00:16:53,201 --> 00:16:54,261
health status.

289
00:16:54,261 --> 00:16:56,824
And right here in the middle of this analysis and

290
00:16:56,824 --> 00:17:01,140
sensitivity analysis is what we can use a mathematical model to do keep in mind.

291
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:04,915
These mathematical models are just going to look at quantifiable factors, but

292
00:17:04,915 --> 00:17:07,839
not necessarily those non quantifiable factors.

293
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,447
Yeah.
