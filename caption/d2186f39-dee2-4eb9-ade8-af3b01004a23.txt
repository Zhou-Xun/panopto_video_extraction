1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:10,770
So any announcement or maybe they want to add on some events happening this weekend.

2
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:22,260
Well, the activist marches burning is just about metaphorically, not like Warren, who don't want to burn.

3
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:35,520
And I thought that I were talking. And what we've decided to do is cancel class on Election Day to make sure that everyone votes.

4
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,360
So that's your public health responsibility.

5
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:50,610
The only thing I would encourage people to do is to ask at least two friends to

6
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:55,259
vote and make sure they vote like they tell two friends and they tell two friends.

7
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,170
So, yeah, this vote is really, really important.

8
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:11,960
I think, you know, here in Michigan, obviously, we've got some proposal, proposals, amendments, sense of the word right now.

9
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:16,560
Thank you. I'm on the ballot right now that have huge public health implications.

10
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:25,080
Also, the race for the governor also has huge public health implications given the viewpoints of the two candidates.

11
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:33,660
So I would strongly, strongly encourage you all to vote and to also make sure you encourage your friends to vote.

12
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:42,659
I think, you know, one thing is in academic institutions, we often try to separate ourselves from the real world,

13
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:50,820
which is something we shouldn't be doing in public health, and that you really cannot be a public health professional about the people,

14
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:57,300
because everything that we do in public health has political implications.

15
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:01,470
Either there's implications in terms of how we get our funding,

16
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:08,640
or we're using the political process to set up regulations or standards that promote the health of communities.

17
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:13,080
So we really can't divorce politics from public health.

18
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:20,730
That really is your responsibility, as, you know, future public health leaders to get out and vote.

19
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:30,060
I'm not going to tell you who to vote for that is illegal and inappropriate at a state run institution.

20
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:37,980
Well, it's a teach in a private as they were. And I want but I am not any more interesting.

21
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:47,970
When I was at a private Catholic university, I could say more obnoxious things that I can say at a public university, which is pretty weird.

22
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:57,209
So anyway, that's a talk for another day and I am being recorded along.

23
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:07,380
We love the administration. Yeah, he didn't want to talk about, you know, the university's general mandate.

24
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:15,780
No, no, you're. If you're not. I wanted to give a reminder for I know not everybody was here on Tuesday,

25
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:19,739
so I have journals over there for people who didn't think I was up on Tuesday.

26
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:23,430
So I just wanted to make sure it's very kind of you.

27
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:29,460
And if you don't get it today, we're going to burn it. And I.

28
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:37,620
All right. So does anyone remember what we did last time?

29
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:45,940
You know, it was only two days, and we'll have to, like, test you all for brain trauma and mental health.

30
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:51,040
Call you them on. Yeah, we had a what do we do?

31
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:59,430
What do we do during groups? Remember, you walk around the room, I talk to you, Akeelah.

32
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:02,790
Talk to you. You talk to each other. What did you talk about?

33
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:08,820
Wasn't the weather the latest in the homes that are in recess?

34
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:15,600
Oh, yeah. That's going to like. Yeah, excellent.

35
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:24,450
Does anyone remember what your group because you all came up with amazing intervention components.

36
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:31,649
Well, first, let's go to the health problem analysis. So I know some some groups were struggling a little bit with this.

37
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:43,290
And I just want to make sure that everyone is perfectly clear on how this works because it's important.

38
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:48,209
And again, this class is a little more directed toward public health practice than some of your other classes.

39
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:53,550
So this is what we call a practical tool, something that will actually make a difference in the world.

40
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:59,910
So I'm a little cynical today, but I love.

41
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:06,290
University of Michigan. Yeah. So it's a really great place to work.

42
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:10,130
I love my job. So.

43
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:18,170
So who can share any insights that you have from using this now that you actually had to sit down and think about it?

44
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:21,739
Because especially for people who chose the substance use pathway,

45
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:29,810
it was a lot more challenging because mental health and substance use issues are always much, much more difficult to come up with.

46
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:35,690
Looking at the analysis, what do you remember about this?

47
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:41,870
Yes, like a score. We did the type two diabetes, but we identified obesity as a risk factor.

48
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:47,530
But we couldn't just cure obesity. Right. And it took a lot of other factors in there.

49
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:52,190
Okay, good. What else? What else? One of the people that about use this model.

50
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,890
Yeah. Oh, I think it's fun.

51
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:03,020
Yes. It's like one thing where it's like, we'll do the intervention into the trainings, to the material.

52
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:09,050
So decisions like if people are enjoying the curriculum, really actively applying themselves, you know.

53
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:15,440
Right. Yeah. So that talked about like when we were developing the intervention components for the different parts.

54
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:19,520
You know, you have to keep in mind these are humans that we're working with, right?

55
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:28,420
And if we're developing something that is supposed to help change behavior, people have to listen to incorporate it.

56
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:29,750
They have to enjoy it.

57
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:39,320
No one wants to come to an intervention or a group that's really boring as [INAUDIBLE] and using outdated materials or inappropriate materials.

58
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:45,350
Really? I should say I figured if you look at how like sometimes using these conceptual models is

59
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:48,100
like weird because there's something that really kind of bi directional where you're like,

60
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:51,410
you can kind of put them either way of like, know what's the risk factor,

61
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:55,540
what's contributing factor like depending on how you frame it or how you think about it, can kind of go either way.

62
00:06:55,550 --> 00:07:01,270
So I think like these are really helpful, but they also can be like kind of open ended and if there's more than one way to construct it,

63
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:05,540
and I think that's just like a challenge, but also I think a positive thing.

64
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,310
Yeah, exactly. Yeah.

65
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:15,560
And that's an excellent point because if you go down one pathway with one risk factors, so, you know, let's say obesity is a risk factor.

66
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:21,260
There's so many different things that could impact that.

67
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:27,210
But also obesity could be even a direct contributing factor if you're talking about physical activity.

68
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:31,309
So it's harder to physical activity if you're heavier and you're out of shape.

69
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:37,610
I mean, so there's some things like that. And again, that's why this is a good tool to use.

70
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:45,040
But again, this is of no practice, that research. So we don't have to define it and measure it and then put it into an equation.

71
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:49,760
We're dealing with humans, so almost the time, I guess we're not really doing animal health.

72
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:54,980
You could, I guess, or you could work with animals to to improve human health.

73
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:58,430
But so it doesn't have to fit.

74
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:04,610
Exactly. But it gives us insight into what are some of the causal are contributing factors.

75
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,530
Excellent. What else? Just general comments about the utility of the model or challenges?

76
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:19,010
Yeah. I think our group, when we did the alcohol abuse, it was kind of hard to distinguish like the direct contributing factor versus the risk factor.

77
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:25,130
Sorry, I was really loud and I think the thing.

78
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:28,470
I'm sorry, okay?

79
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:40,549
I'm a little distracted, but I think I think the, you know, like the risk factors being more individual, for example, is like a lot more helpful.

80
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:44,750
And then like the direct picture being factors kind of being more on a population level.

81
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:46,309
Mm hmm. Yeah, exactly.

82
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:54,590
So when we're talking about the things that are the risk factors, these are things that we know scientifically are related to this health problem.

83
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:59,150
And so that's why when we're talking about biomedical health issues like diabetes,

84
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:03,140
it's a lot easier to know directly by automatically what causes that.

85
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:09,770
When we're talking about mental health and substance use, we don't have that same level of knowledge or understanding, and it's not that simple.

86
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:12,170
So that's what makes it a lot harder.

87
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:21,980
And as you said, as we go farther down the list, we're looking at more population level, community level, organizational level, things like that.

88
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:26,980
Yeah, it's not about to tell you about what you said. Right.

89
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:34,430
I'm sorry. It's not off the charts about what you said. Those I don't know. Is it that it's more hard to trace risk factors for,

90
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:44,780
like mental health versus like like biomedical problems because it's actually harder or because like that's what our health system has focused on.

91
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:48,860
So we have more like experience with that is actually harder.

92
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:52,070
Yeah, that's a really great question. It is actually harder.

93
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:58,340
And it's because when we talk about mental health, mental health diagnoses are socially constructed.

94
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:03,810
Right. Right. Whereas like with. With diabetes, you can look at blood tests, you know, bloody bingo, stuff like that.

95
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:10,170
Mental health disorders change over time when social norms change, and the DSM,

96
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:19,170
the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders or the ICD International Classification Diseases sets what the standards are.

97
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:23,640
So there are some disorders like homosexuality was a disorder.

98
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:29,070
You know, other things around transvestite ism was a disorder, all these other things.

99
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:36,720
So because they're socially constructed and determined, there's not always a direct link.

100
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:40,950
Now some things like depression and like major depressive disorder,

101
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:48,810
we do know that there are some biological components that have been tested and we know about like genetic factors, familial factors.

102
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,140
But so many of those things are also impacted by the environment, you know, and how people connect.

103
00:10:54,150 --> 00:11:01,990
So that's why mental health issues are just so much more complex. Yeah, we don't have you know, there's no blood test for, you know,

104
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:06,660
different mental health disorders, but there are blood tests for physical health disorders.

105
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:16,230
Yeah. Yeah. So you can do this kind of format for biomedical issue or or like a mental health issue or not like a health behavior as a health problem.

106
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:21,890
Yeah. I mean, that that would be typically that would be one of the risk factors.

107
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:27,450
So really, you want your outcome to be a health problem or challenge or issue.

108
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:33,570
And then where the health behaviors come in is those are things that that are leading to that,

109
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:42,629
that you want to try and change as part of your intervention. So it doesn't really work with the health behavior as an outcome that's more would fall

110
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:47,580
into line with what you could do to change one of the other factors that make sense.

111
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:52,050
Okay, cool. Any other questions about those comments?

112
00:11:52,110 --> 00:12:01,870
All right. So. You broke into groups in case you forgot you were placed around the room.

113
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:08,410
You came out with some intervention activities. What was this process like trying to come up with the intervention activities?

114
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:12,820
What challenges did you have and trying to construct intervention activities?

115
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:21,850
I think the Type two diabetes and what I kind of noticed was that it was kind of hard to figure out a good curriculum or intervention for

116
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:30,250
that specific age range because it seems like we always look at interventions for younger children or like elderly older individuals.

117
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:35,950
So like time was a huge factor to monitor because like a lot of like that age

118
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:43,600
range is where so many times in life where it would be an excellent act right now.

119
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:47,520
Yeah, you're right. Because again, you have to look at the context, right?

120
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:51,639
So if people are working all day or people may work different shifts.

121
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:55,450
So you may have some people that are working overnight and some people are working during the

122
00:12:55,450 --> 00:13:00,490
day and some people may be on 12 hour shifts if they're working in a hospital or somewhere else.

123
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:04,490
Other people might be on six or eight hour shifts, so or they may not be working.

124
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:07,930
They may be taking care of their children or taking care of an older adult.

125
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:16,649
Excellent. What other challenges did you have in doing that? The rest of you figure it out really easy.

126
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:21,980
It just like a piece of my head. I don't know. Whatever it is, this is his body.

127
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:29,190
That's it? Yeah. I don't know if this was just an issue with our group, but I think we can do a little.

128
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:35,550
So it was a little easier trying to find intervention for, like, the injected diarrhea.

129
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:40,020
Yeah, but when you're trying to find, like, an intervention, that actual.

130
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:46,490
It was a little difficult to find something that was able to encompass everything because it's such a broad.

131
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,310
Mm hmm. So that was just like a challenge we had. I don't know if that was, like, this is your group.

132
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:56,630
No, I just. And was it. So which one did you use?

133
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:00,710
Did you do the substance use? I'm like, okay.

134
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:11,090
Yeah. So and again, with that one where because those direct determinants or risk factors are harder to determine,

135
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:17,659
you may need to kind of take a step back and change something that will change that, which will then change alcohol.

136
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:20,630
So it can be it can be tricky to do.

137
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:27,040
I was going to say we were finding it really difficult to do an intervention that wouldn't change the entire system.

138
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:31,270
So like one of the things we were talking about was how to decrease stress on college campuses.

139
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:39,170
Right? As one that was so hard to come up with things that weren't totally out there, you know, like it's so ingrained into the system.

140
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:43,190
Yeah. There wasn't like. There weren't, like, limited interventions that we could do.

141
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:52,340
Right. Right. Yeah. One thing I noticed from my popping around the groups was that a lot of people were thinking big structural level changes,

142
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:57,080
which it was great to to know that you're thinking at that level.

143
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:04,099
But the practicality of actually being able to do that is low and will be very time consuming.

144
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:11,149
And that doesn't mean you should not do that, but when you have a grant to do a public health intervention,

145
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:20,270
you need to show outcomes and you need to show the community that you're doing something with them on their behalf, you know, in collaboration.

146
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:26,090
So when we're doing those, if we're thinking about those big level structural change things,

147
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:30,710
those are things that's going to be really hard to get funding for. Just be practical and real.

148
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:40,040
Like if I go to the, you know, CDC and say, I want to end racism on the U of M campus, and I have like $10 million.

149
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:43,610
And, you know, I'll get back with you in a year. It's not going to happen.

150
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:51,950
But if I look at like attitudes toward different ethnic racial groups, that's something that's more addressable.

151
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,690
The other thing to keep in mind is when we're talking about public health interventions,

152
00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:02,120
I want you to think back to the articles that you critiqued because those are the types

153
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:06,110
of things when we're in public health and we talk about interventions or programs,

154
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:10,549
we're talking about things that have a discreet beginning and an end, right?

155
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:15,860
So it's not just I'm going to build a new clinic. That's a great structural level intervention.

156
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:20,810
But again, getting funding for that is going to be a lot more challenging.

157
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:30,590
But again, you could be working on that while you're doing a group based intervention or a community social marketing intervention, things like that.

158
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:35,690
And one thing I learned a couple of years ago, which, you know,

159
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:41,870
didn't even occur to me because I've been doing this for a long time, is that the word intervention may be interpreted differently.

160
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:46,670
So when you think of intervention, what do you think of like what does that word mean to you?

161
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:54,710
I think there's some generational differences. I'm 20 generations away.

162
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,800
Yes. You have substances from your friends are trying to help you bring me meaning.

163
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:04,800
Exactly. And it's all because that TV show. Was there a TV show following the intervention or something like that?

164
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:13,550
What about other people? That other people get the same idea in their head, which is, I guess is on those on people's leave.

165
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:17,790
Okay. It's amazing. I think somebody you're sleeping with your eyes.

166
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:25,140
And I would really like to learn how to do that fact that it would be much easier to sleep the whole time, but literally alert.

167
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:33,330
That would be amazing. So anyway, I don't mean to be obnoxious, but it just falls out sometimes.

168
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:41,940
So in public health, when we're talking about interventions, we're talking about things that have a discreet beginning and a discreet end.

169
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:52,680
So if we're talking about, you know, a mental health intervention and we're trying to improve people's adaptive coping skills,

170
00:17:53,160 --> 00:18:00,600
then we're going to have let's say if we're going to do it, let's say we want to do it at a larger level.

171
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:04,350
So for all incoming students and I think we talked about that,

172
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:08,190
that I was talking about some course you had to take online, everyone's like, what are you talking about?

173
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:15,990
And then someone said, Yeah, there is one, but I didn't do it. That could be an interaction because there's still a discrete beginning to that end.

174
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:22,080
So when you come in, you're supposed to go online, take this little thing, and then you know it's over.

175
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:32,160
So when you're writing grants, which like your final project is a grant application, which we're going to talk a little bit about today,

176
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:38,459
or if you're working in public health practice and you're developing an intervention or program,

177
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:46,110
you have to think about it again as a discrete beginning at the screen end and then have set activities that are occurring.

178
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:53,549
So one thing that I often see people think about when we're talking about public health interventions is they say,

179
00:18:53,550 --> 00:19:03,660
Oh, well, we're just going to have support groups. Well, support groups have variable effects in the true sense.

180
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:08,400
A support group is really just people dealing with the same issue, getting support from each other.

181
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:15,270
Oftentimes that may be a component of an intervention, but that typically is not a full intervention.

182
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:23,850
Now, if you have a group where you have a curriculum that you're going through and like in the first session as part of the group,

183
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:31,830
you know, you're talking about the origins of health equities for your particular identity group,

184
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:40,980
then that's an intervention because you're actually planning something you're making is, you know, a specific deliverable that is occurring.

185
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:45,300
So that's an important distinction and that's really important for your next assignment.

186
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:50,400
Are they submit your work on a now but then also for your your final assignment.

187
00:19:54,110 --> 00:20:01,340
What was it like trying to come up with critical strategies when you were thinking of your intervention components?

188
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:05,330
What challenges did you have there?

189
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:14,810
Now that you're all three and experts, I think we were thinking that like it can be a very individualistic kind of thing.

190
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:17,330
Sometimes it's like you're asking someone to reflect.

191
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:23,450
We talked about like maybe make it like journal or keep a diary of like how much alcohol they're consuming.

192
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:30,220
But that might be some people might hate that or like they might not think that way or reflect that way.

193
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:34,090
And so, like, while it might work for half the population, maybe.

194
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:38,510
Right. And so I think, like, that was tough to kind of yeah, that's a good point.

195
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:46,540
And you know, I think too, when you're having and you can have individual level like you're talking about individual level reflections that

196
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:54,560
that can be done with like journaling or even through an individual based kind of app or computer type program.

197
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:59,450
But then you can also do that within group settings as well.

198
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:04,999
So if you have small groups of like 6 to 8 people, I mean, we do adhere to some point in a larger group.

199
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:13,220
So you could do in a larger group too now. So it is it is hard, though, because not everyone is going to have the same reaction to that.

200
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:19,090
Right. Like some people might be like, oh my God, I never thought about that. And other people maybe, oh my God, this is an idiot.

201
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:24,950
I already know all this [INAUDIBLE]. Why am I here? You know, and then our fun factor goes way down and people don't return.

202
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,130
Other challenges you had in making it critical.

203
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:41,510
Everyone else is super easy breezy provided you write down your intervention components now and grade it, you know I'll get a hundred.

204
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:47,610
How much thought about like individuals for the second intervention,

205
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:54,690
like how they view that health care system in their willingness to receive help and like if they have diabetes.

206
00:21:55,140 --> 00:22:02,250
So it's like I kind of because we saw in our second class we had the option to do like Color of Care,

207
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:07,350
which is like a documentary about like during closing and the health care system as a whole.

208
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:15,930
And just like the accessibility, like someone's like if they have insurance or not.

209
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:19,470
So coverage. Yeah, so and procedures.

210
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:30,030
I don't know. We just thought about that and how it makes it much more difficult to develop a good, really great point.

211
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:39,209
But I do I like the idea of showing media so you know, as a part of a group, you know, group session,

212
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:44,460
you could watch clips of it like you do in a class and then have a discussion because media a lot of times can

213
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:51,240
activate things in different ways because some people may be more visual learners may be more affective oriented,

214
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,690
some may be more textual. So like to read, see things.

215
00:22:55,140 --> 00:23:01,590
So trying to activate people with different senses of that can be really, really positive.

216
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:06,000
And you probably know from watching that you have an emotional reaction to.

217
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:12,040
Right. Yeah. So when you see everybody, so when you're I mean, I would say incredibly boring, but yeah,

218
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:21,840
but when you when you activate people's emotions, then that's much more likely to bring about behavior change.

219
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:27,509
You know, if you're just sitting in your hall up here in the cognitive space, but you don't get to like the emotional,

220
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:33,839
the affective space, it's easy to fall out, but when you feel something because you remember that, right?

221
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:41,640
Yeah. So that's something that's now in your head. So when you can get people to a point where they have an affect of an emotional response,

222
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,540
much more likely to have behavior change than if people are just like,

223
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:55,109
Oh, you eat this, eat that, or Yeah, I know I'm not supposed to drink a six pack after my exam, but you know, that's just what Akeelah told me.

224
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:58,110
And what is she, even though she's not taking her daily chemistry.

225
00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:01,350
So know I'm just going down all this.

226
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:16,160
All these beers that did not even sound like anything I would ever say I was going to say, Bruce is what I did was I never said that.

227
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:24,780
I realized that when I'm imitating other people, what other challenges were there to try to make intervention components critical?

228
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:32,820
I think to I'm going to try and be a stand up comic. I, you know, screw the teaching stuff and to see how how many laughs I get.

229
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:36,730
Anything else? So were you all amazing and wonderful? Yes.

230
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:43,400
I think, like you said earlier, it was just so hard to kind of get out of those big structural changes.

231
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:50,459
Yeah. And then kind of like shift into like that like critical approach because like the

232
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:56,720
first thing that came in my oh like amount of exams like given day are right.

233
00:24:56,970 --> 00:25:06,120
So it's hard to kind of switch gears and kind of think critically and like what could be applied realistically with like this substance abuse, right?

234
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:09,690
Yeah. Yeah. And one thing you could do, like, so when you're doing, you know,

235
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:13,499
interventions in the real world since that's about how I want you to think you

236
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,590
may have different components that may be on different parts of that pyramid.

237
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:25,740
So it could be if you're trying to reduce stress, you could have like for one semester have a policy where,

238
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:30,960
you know, everyone gets a free pass on one of their exams or something like that.

239
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:34,440
But that wouldn't be your only thing you'd still want to have.

240
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:39,930
Like groups around adaptive coping or skills based were social skills, things like that.

241
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:43,470
So it could be part of like a bigger program.

242
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:45,780
But yeah, but it is hard because I times, you know,

243
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:53,010
I think in your classes you're being taught and trained to think about social determinants of health, which is great and amazing.

244
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:58,950
But again, most interventions do not directly impact all the social determinants of health.

245
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:06,330
Yes. Mean what would be a way to make a less critical intervention or like like the example

246
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:10,379
of the one pass that you gave mom and you have said like other components without,

247
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:20,130
like for not necessarily having to make like group curriculum for everything, like what would be some, maybe other ways to make it more critical, etc.

248
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:29,100
Yeah. So I think that, you know, part of it could be you could have like social.

249
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:39,860
Marketing campaigns are different information that's showing the association between a kind of distress being perpetuated by,

250
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:47,660
you know, different beliefs or whatever. Like here, you know, again, although I love to work here, you know, there's the biggest and the best.

251
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:57,380
It's whatever the leaders the be all that crap. You know you could have a campaign of like you can be the best and still take a break, you know?

252
00:26:57,710 --> 00:27:02,610
So it's like trying to break down those messages and change them, right?

253
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:05,989
To do that, let's just do it. Yeah. All right.

254
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:14,149
So let's just start doing who you can do poster design. Now you have a right plaster the shed everywhere pretty seriously.

255
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:18,170
I mean, it's like again, it goes into that, you know, that that framework we talked about before,

256
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:22,309
especially for women where you have to do everything and have to be perfect and do all that other crap.

257
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:28,790
So yeah. So that's a way that you could take something that's a little more structural, but add that critical component.

258
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:32,870
So that way if people are taking a break, they're not just taking a break.

259
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:38,470
You're like, Who got off? But they're thinking about, Oh yeah, I guess we do put a lot of pressure on ourselves because I hope.

260
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:41,720
Yeah, cool. All right.

261
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:48,740
The other thing, when you're coming up with these intervention components, going back to the earlier comment, you got to have fun.

262
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:52,280
So get out of your academic brains. All right.

263
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:56,120
So now, when I was talking to a lot of groups, you know,

264
00:27:56,120 --> 00:28:00,200
you're doing I can tell you're doing well in your other classes because you're really

265
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:04,970
thinking about all these structural level factors and all these other things.

266
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:08,629
But again, at the end of the day, you had to make it fun.

267
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:17,050
So how can you make interventions fun? Stop being intellectual and be creative.

268
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:20,650
Right. I know most faculty don't encourage you to be creative.

269
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,550
We're big on, like, memorization and regurgitation.

270
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,780
But how do we make it funny? Really?

271
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:35,030
End of business for as much as just like incentivizing, but like offering some sort of like incentive for people to actually call,

272
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:40,970
whether it be like free food or like a small like gift card or something like that.

273
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:44,840
No, actually, like make people go because they think like it's actually worth thinking about, like college kids and young adults.

274
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:48,960
Like we're so busy as is that if someone was like, Hey, you want to come to our thing?

275
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:53,220
He's like, Every time I do, like, offering some sort of incentive to make it worth their time.

276
00:28:53,240 --> 00:29:00,830
Okay. And I agree with that. And I also think it's kind of like it's human nature to, like, want to compete.

277
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:07,810
So, like, making it like, not like actually a competition, but like getting a, like a competitive atmosphere,

278
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:12,740
like kind of like making people really, like, passionate about getting involved and be like, oh, I did this.

279
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:16,760
Like, that's like maybe it does give me a little bit incentive for like whatever.

280
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:22,220
I think there's part of competition I think does like, I think that's like part of everyone's kind of.

281
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:30,530
Yeah. With that. So like with the, the big blood drive they always have is, um, between Michigan State and University of Michigan,

282
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:35,900
although I still have issues with the fact that gay men can't donate blood, but that's a whole other issue.

283
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:39,430
But yeah, so, so, but some people use that.

284
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:44,810
The one thing I have to be careful about is thinking about for some groups,

285
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:50,930
that competition may be a place where they've often been further minoritized and oppressed.

286
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:55,730
So we do have to think about what that competition means and what type of competition.

287
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,600
So I think it's just important to keep that in mind.

288
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:13,420
Um, what are some other fun ways to like something that happens?

289
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:17,299
All right. That's true. I'm doing it.

290
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:22,620
I'm here for this semester. You're part of a new experiment I'm doing on the hands of stress on student performance.

291
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:26,300
Know you're doing time in concert? Yeah.

292
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:33,890
I was going to say, like, maybe tailoring it to this season's like, I mean, obviously, we had like 15 different seasons.

293
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:40,160
Like, if it's a summer, like you could if you're doing groups like it could be like outdoors, like, yeah,

294
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:49,579
like the art or if it's like around the holidays, which is some stressful writing, cookie decorating, you're like, Yeah, no.

295
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:53,750
I mean, I think again, paying attention to contextual factors, right?

296
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:59,450
So seasons are a thing here. I mean, you know, the new license plates you've been talking about, what is it?

297
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:04,820
Water and water? Yeah, no problem.

298
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:09,260
And so yeah. So I mean, that's another now one.

299
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:14,180
That's interesting. Even in all your responses so far, there's still semi structural.

300
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:20,270
So it's about competition is like a, you know, it's part of a framework incentive as part of a framework.

301
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:23,870
This part of what about fun? Let's think about fun.

302
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:26,930
A specific activity. Do you have a really fun idea?

303
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:31,370
I don't know if you're going to have a really good ride. Yeah, I don't know.

304
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:38,600
I kind of thought about like something that I'm currently planning and kind of our way to get people to get

305
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:46,729
engaged was to just bring people that have the same energy or the same like like people that would actually,

306
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:50,650
like, make the event more approachable.

307
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:56,450
So, yeah. So for example, like she's planning this like all inclusive, like Camp Day event.

308
00:31:56,910 --> 00:32:02,270
It's supposed to be like a one day Camp Day type of thing and like obviously like having like a bunch of,

309
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:07,849
like adults like monitor, like monitoring, monitoring. Everyone would be like very much like dreaming.

310
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:14,270
So we're like, why don't we invite this person who seems to have, like, this much energy to like and like do that.

311
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:17,299
So that way that that people can relate.

312
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:25,470
And then there's like also an approach to that sort of group. So I think like just keeping in mind the kind of group that you are targeting, right?

313
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:35,599
And like how to work around that. Another great structural example of how to structure the format, but it's a good one.

314
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:39,559
I mean, it it is really important to think about who's going to deliver your intervention.

315
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:47,030
Right? So and there's a lot of there's been a fair amount of research in different areas that have looked

316
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:52,340
at who's the best type of facilitator or health educator and person to present the information.

317
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:58,130
And it's really depended on the population, that health issue, what you're trying to get them to do.

318
00:32:58,430 --> 00:33:04,280
So one thing that like for brains is they're like smoking cessation and smoking prevention.

319
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:10,130
For adolescents, having a medical provider provide some information is helpful,

320
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:15,350
but having peers that are like them present other information is helpful.

321
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:16,879
Same thing with sexual health.

322
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:25,940
With adolescents, they might they some aspects, especially around STIs, they respond better when a medical practitioner talks about it.

323
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:30,280
But when you're talking about sexual negotiation. They respond better to peers.

324
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:41,530
So you have to really think about who's presenting. And then also, you know, the the personality, the person's comfort and talking in front of people.

325
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:52,210
I mean, I've I've trained a lot of people in like structured interventions over the years and have fired a lot of people who just are dead.

326
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:57,010
You know, it's like I remember we're doing this big intervention in San Francisco one time and

327
00:33:57,010 --> 00:34:01,570
we had basically was like a casting call for anyone who wanted to be part of it.

328
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:11,740
And we made them do part of an intervention in front of our team to see who could actually relate and who would be fun.

329
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:14,799
You know, because if someone is up here, like, okay,

330
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:23,110
now we're going to talk about the difference between adaptive and maladaptive coping with who can tell me what adaptive coping.

331
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:27,250
All right. So you're not going to like that, right? I mean, you might, but I wouldn't.

332
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:32,980
And and there's a lot of people I mean, come on. You all take classes, right, from faculty.

333
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:41,530
There's some people that should not be in front of a class, but they love the University of Michigan.

334
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:48,400
And we have to really think about that with our interventions. Right. You kind of have to come to class if you want to grade.

335
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:58,209
If I'm coming in for, you know, an intervention about diabetes, I don't really have to be here.

336
00:34:58,210 --> 00:35:01,250
And if it's really stupid, I'm going to get up and leave. Right.

337
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:06,100
And in most consent forms, if it's a part of a research study, it says you're free to leave at any time.

338
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:09,550
So you can you're incentive in peace out. You're gone.

339
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:14,650
So you've got to have people engage. Now, I'm waiting for the really important comment.

340
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:17,980
You're about to leave, but no pressure whatsoever.

341
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:32,049
This isn't like an example. So my sister's a fund raiser for this organization that she's planning in the name of the families.

342
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:38,320
And I was just like, this kind of like, that's okay.

343
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:41,500
I talked to a lot of eyes, but they're like no strings.

344
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:49,720
And they had French fries like a room at three a.

345
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:55,340
Think so. Now, first, they'd be like different health tents.

346
00:35:55,480 --> 00:36:00,050
Mm hmm. And now we did hustle, and they were teaching us how to do nothing.

347
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:04,249
Right, right. Community hustle. It's like. Yeah, thanks.

348
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:09,290
I was really fine. And I feel like just incorporating, you know, different cultural activities.

349
00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:12,349
Yeah, exactly. Right. Like it's my sister.

350
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:19,250
So, of course, I was like, hey, I wasn't really expecting it to really be like that, but it was really, you know.

351
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:26,780
No, that's that's a great idea, because if you do something that's fun and make it educational, then people are going to do it.

352
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:34,459
And again, it's an emotional thing, right? So if you're if you're dancing and learning, are you create games where you're doing you know,

353
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:38,930
you're playing a game and learning like a big one that I've seen a lot of interventions

354
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:43,490
and it's because this TV show has been on forever is like health jeopardy,

355
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:50,120
you know. So you can have like with one intervention we developed, we did a lot of what it was.

356
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:55,250
It was a little racy, but it was like sexual pleasure jeopardy,

357
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:59,810
because we're trying to focus on sexual pleasure as opposed to always talking about disease.

358
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:09,530
So we had some really interesting categories and I will not share with you that in public university, but it was a lot of, a lot of fun.

359
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:18,620
Um, you know, that some people remember because they're like, Oh, remember that game where you did blah blah, blah, which I'm very good.

360
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:24,829
Someone else I thought most recently I was kind of like saying, Well, I think I kind of like mentioned it,

361
00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:32,219
but like so I usually personally I'm like a lot of people like in terms of like awareness for different situations.

362
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:41,660
So there's a lot of simulation games and like the choices you make within the game can affect the outcome of this equation.

363
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:48,799
So one time I watch I played like this game where I was like about like drowning and like being in like the water and like talking about

364
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:55,820
like the risk and like what you should like the proper steps to do and the ways like that and like that is like an extreme like scenario.

365
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:59,090
I think you could apply that to different types of health interventions,

366
00:37:59,090 --> 00:38:04,459
specifically talking about like choices you make could affect the outcome and

367
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:08,390
just like having an emotional appeal as well as like the logical appeal of it,

368
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:13,230
but it's also like a fun thing because you get to see like how your choices actually create the consequences, you know?

369
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:21,710
Yeah, yeah, exactly. Great example. There's a whole field of what they call gamification and in public health and like e-health or mHealth,

370
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,220
there's actually have a colleague that just started a new center at Florida State.

371
00:38:28,330 --> 00:38:36,710
Oh, what's it called? Yeah, anyway, but something about innovation and electronic crap.

372
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:43,010
But that's a much better name. But yeah, but that's, you know, and that's something too where you have to think about the age group, right?

373
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:48,560
So doing gamification for people over 55, probably not the best thing,

374
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:54,110
but doing it for high school students, college students, you know, could be really, really helpful.

375
00:38:54,110 --> 00:39:03,200
So yeah, there's definitely that's an area, I think where, you know, some people in the field really feel like that's the future.

376
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:09,950
I still I'm like a fan of human contact, but I think that for some people that can be really beneficial,

377
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:16,339
especially at the individual level that you can do. So you can create because it did work with the rest of us here.

378
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:25,520
Josie Baumeister On one where depending on your responses, like you said, it takes you to different parts and things like that.

379
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:34,819
And there's even like a center that is part here and part elsewhere that's all about kind of help,

380
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:38,809
decision making and using apps and other things like that.

381
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:46,310
So they have all these fancy algorithms like based on what you say to previous questions, it'll guide you down one path versus another.

382
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:52,670
And it's supposed to then better predict what's going to help motivate you versus someone else.

383
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:59,770
So yeah, so there's a lot of science and technology going into it. It's such a we like to do something that is not going to work.

384
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:03,350
I know you were trying to like get us to think like to not be structure.

385
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:11,090
Yeah, but it's like, I don't know, it's worth like letting the participants choose what's fine because I think everything we said has been good.

386
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:17,120
We've been kind of like directing, excuse me, indirect, like what should happen?

387
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:24,829
Like, I don't know, there's like some way to just, like, direct, you know, if that makes no sense at all.

388
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:28,070
I have no idea what you about, but does anyone there? Yes. No. Yeah.

389
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:31,460
No, I think that choice can be really good, right?

390
00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:37,520
Because, again, part of oppression is not having choice, not having opportunities to make your own decisions.

391
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:42,140
So you could have things set up where, you know, you could do this or you could do that,

392
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:47,780
or you could structure an activity so that it could be altered depending on what the group wants.

393
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:51,140
So, yeah, there's a lot of ways where you can can bring in.

394
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:57,339
Well, we often at the beginning of interventions to create what we used to call ground rules.

395
00:40:57,340 --> 00:41:01,630
But I like to call living arrangements because ground rules is like so, so hierarchical.

396
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:07,150
So we use the term living arrangements if we're going to be together for the next 3 hours.

397
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:14,070
Let's talk about how we want to interact with each other. And so then people get to assert what they are comfortable with, what they're not.

398
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:17,920
And so that sets the framework and it gives them choice and autonomy.

399
00:41:18,130 --> 00:41:23,080
And then we move on to the intervention. Any other creative, fun ideas?

400
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:32,670
Yeah, I think humor is a really important component of having women because like, if you say something that's funny,

401
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:42,249
then when people are going to laugh and want to tell people about what makes a man that kind of like spreads your message and then causes people to,

402
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:47,950
like, explain why it was funny or like the context behind why it's funny, right?

403
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:52,270
And then that kind of involves like the critical reflection part of it.

404
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:58,590
And yeah, it helps. Like spreading the message to more people, like after your intervention as well.

405
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:03,870
Right. Yeah. I mean, and if you think about it, the laughing and humor is emotional.

406
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,220
It's affective again.

407
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:12,330
So if you're laughing about something, you're going to be more likely to remember that, like you said, you also would be more likely to share that.

408
00:42:12,750 --> 00:42:16,079
It's like, Oh, we did this really cool thing where blah, blah, blah, you know?

409
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:20,610
And that's another thing too, where if you're not funny, own it.

410
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:25,470
There are some people I mean, I can be corny at times a lot,

411
00:42:25,830 --> 00:42:33,810
but I know some people who I've watched in interventions and it's like cringing the whole time.

412
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:35,970
But you know, please don't say that.

413
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:51,180
Or especially like for us older people, people in my generation that try and act hip and cool, even using those words is just so.

414
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:57,120
I don't do that. And if you see someone doing it, just pull them aside.

415
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:01,320
Let them have a seat. Maybe give them a beat. You can't complain.

416
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:07,320
Yeah, but and again, that's why these things, it may seem like, oh, this is superficial.

417
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:12,360
It's not. That can be a difference between an interaction being effective and not, you know,

418
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:19,620
if you try and build and humor and everything you say and everyone just sits there is like, okay, that's really stupid.

419
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:23,340
That's really stupid. They're not going to remember anything from the intervention.

420
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:28,840
They're just going to remember that you were an idiot. Well, I think you shouldn't be so strict, but you're not very funny to me.

421
00:43:28,910 --> 00:43:39,870
Mean, I agree. And I'm not the kind of, I guess what encompasses that which might be like I'm surprised that we did this yet but like creativity,

422
00:43:39,870 --> 00:43:49,950
the first thing I think of art and even like in my job, like I work for the sustainability program and like kind of breaking that sustainability silo.

423
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:56,910
So now like this year they have, there's like five new cultural organizers, which is like something to create like.

424
00:43:58,690 --> 00:44:03,280
Try to combine art and sustainability and actually like a lot of things could be

425
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:06,820
related with art because I think that's a way that people can connect pretty easily.

426
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:14,320
And since art is so like you can have comedy as art, you can have like visual art, there's a lot of different ways that that can manifest.

427
00:44:14,590 --> 00:44:19,690
I feel like that be a great way for people to connect with, like public health issues in a way that,

428
00:44:20,110 --> 00:44:24,040
like, they can kind of kind of like what you just point about choice.

429
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:31,450
Like you're you're not restricted to a specific type of art. So I think that's like the first thing I thought of in.

430
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:34,629
Yeah. No, I'm glad you brought that. And dancing, too, like you were talking about.

431
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:39,430
That's an artistic expression. Yeah, artistic expression is really important.

432
00:44:39,550 --> 00:44:45,850
You may not like you get a lot of interventions where we have a component that has artistic expression and a lot of people are like,

433
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:50,200
I'm not an artist. And like, that's okay. You know, we're not here to create a Rembrandt.

434
00:44:50,530 --> 00:44:55,480
You know, we're here to, like, draw your emotions so you don't have to be a perfectionist.

435
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:58,840
Or what I'll do sometimes is I'll give people a choice.

436
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:03,219
So in some of our interventions, we'll have people express things like time.

437
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:11,410
You can use words, you can use pictures or you can use symbols, and then people can pick which they want to use, what they're more comfortable with.

438
00:45:11,410 --> 00:45:18,970
And so some people will draw these elaborate pictures. Some people will just put words, some will use like icons or symbols or other images.

439
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:23,560
That way that goes back to the choice issue. It goes to the creativity.

440
00:45:23,830 --> 00:45:31,030
And it goes to also, you know, recognize you realize that people have different levels of comfort with different forms of expression.

441
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:37,240
Yeah. So art and artistic endeavors and you may say I think I don't have any artistic skills.

442
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:42,670
That's why in public health we don't work and alone we work together.

443
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:49,660
So, you know, sometimes I remember another intervention we did in San Francisco years ago.

444
00:45:49,930 --> 00:45:59,020
We actually brought in someone from the entertainment industry to work with the program to make sure that the elements of it,

445
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:04,360
because we had these videos that we we showed the participants and then they reacted to the videos.

446
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:11,920
And so we wanted a videographer to come in and actually do the videos so that they were something that people would respond to.

447
00:46:12,790 --> 00:46:18,130
So think about collaborating with people outside of traditional public health folks.

448
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:25,930
And a lot of you probably have artistic, you know, knowledge, background, experience, and some may not.

449
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:30,190
But again, it does it it doesn't have to be fine, art.

450
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:33,680
You know, it can be giving people, you know,

451
00:46:33,730 --> 00:46:40,750
different objects and having them put it together to represent something and then, you know, to make it more critical.

452
00:46:40,750 --> 00:46:41,950
What why is that?

453
00:46:41,950 --> 00:46:50,020
You know, why do you think so many people paint, you know, red, when we were talking about this health issue and what do we attach to red?

454
00:46:50,230 --> 00:46:56,390
We attach fear. We attach anger, fear. You know, all these other ideas of that, like, yeah, so all that.

455
00:46:57,060 --> 00:47:05,440
The question like how many people are generally part of like the development of the intervention and do you think it's better

456
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:12,879
to have a larger like professional that is think about that and I can see how there could be like communication issues.

457
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:16,300
Yeah. And like, how do you deal with that? Yeah, that's a really great question.

458
00:47:16,630 --> 00:47:24,800
So all the interventions that I work on and our team works on, we usually have pretty big teams and I would think,

459
00:47:24,850 --> 00:47:29,890
okay, so I mean we typically have people from the community as part of it.

460
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:39,640
So I'll just use a real example. So an intervention we just finished in Kenya, it was for it was a mental health and sexual health for Gabbi man.

461
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:45,880
So we had six gay by men from the community would work with us.

462
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:54,100
They were all leaders of organizations and they were part of our development team and so they were on a call with us every week through Zoom.

463
00:47:55,030 --> 00:48:03,370
And then we had an MPH level health educator, we had an M.D., we had a counseling psychologist and myself.

464
00:48:04,390 --> 00:48:13,360
And so we were able to then bring all of our kind of individual talents and collective energy all together.

465
00:48:13,510 --> 00:48:16,300
And then once we when we build different components,

466
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:24,100
what we would do is then we would we had consultants that we would bring things back to to get more insights.

467
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:27,640
And then after that, we did pilot testing with focus groups.

468
00:48:28,090 --> 00:48:34,360
So it's a lot of folks. I went out a lot. I mean, I guess there were six, ten of us who did it.

469
00:48:34,690 --> 00:48:39,759
But you're right in terms of you have to have a team that can work together, you know,

470
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:45,910
because sometimes people don't all get along and it is tough doing like when you're doing global work.

471
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:54,230
And doing some things in Zoom and then some things in person are even if you're working in the U.S. but you're working in different states,

472
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:59,100
it can be a challenge. So you have to find a structure that works for everyone.

473
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:02,730
So with our, you know,

474
00:49:02,730 --> 00:49:12,030
all of our Zoom calls are either seven and eight or 9 a.m. because those are half the time a seven hour time difference that happened in our country.

475
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:14,880
So it's the beginning of our day. The end of the day.

476
00:49:15,090 --> 00:49:20,220
So you have to think about those kind of things, about if you're truly going to involve the community, what's going to work for them.

477
00:49:20,730 --> 00:49:26,219
And I see that before, like even here in Detroit, where people want citizen, you know,

478
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:31,500
people who live in Detroit to come to Ann Arbor for meetings that doesn't work or

479
00:49:31,590 --> 00:49:36,120
you don't have it in the middle of their workday like we're talking about earlier. No, you have to have those meetings at night.

480
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:43,140
And so that means that you have to drive to Detroit and have a meeting from 6 to 9:00 to do it.

481
00:49:43,170 --> 00:49:50,910
So it's a it's a lot to coordinate, but then you end up with interventions that have to be activated.

482
00:49:51,720 --> 00:50:04,980
And so you are all now intervention specialists, right? So I want to talk about intervention with a framework for developing intervention.

483
00:50:05,010 --> 00:50:16,590
So if you go into an MPH program, especially in health, behavioral health, that there are several different frameworks for intervention development.

484
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:20,249
I know when you were in school, did you have to take classes? You learned different frameworks.

485
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:25,530
Okay. There used to be a really popular one and Prezi proceed.

486
00:50:25,910 --> 00:50:30,000
Did you learn that one? Yeah. And they have all these models. Some are so damn complicated.

487
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:36,810
Like this pre-seed process model has like 10,000 steps, and it loops back around and all this crap.

488
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:39,390
I like this one because it's pretty straightforward.

489
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:49,110
And what these frameworks are, it's just things to help guide your development process for developing public health interventions.

490
00:50:49,890 --> 00:50:58,920
So the first one is developing a logic model, the problem. So having a working group, so having members of your community doing a needs assessment,

491
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:05,820
finding out what you actually need as opposed to coming in and saying This is what we're going to do to you or for you.

492
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:11,400
Thinking about the context of the intervention, including population setting community,

493
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:15,510
a lot of the things we've talked about and then state what your program goals are.

494
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:20,100
So just because you're doing an asthma intervention doesn't mean you have the same goal.

495
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:29,910
Your goal may be cleaner environments or your goal may be getting young people to use their inhaler when they're having attacks.

496
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:33,690
I mean, there's different goals, but you had to be really clear on what is your goal.

497
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:39,780
Now, here it talks a lot about logic models. Does anyone know what a logic model is?

498
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:47,010
We are really doing a horrible job and educating people about public health.

499
00:51:48,390 --> 00:51:52,260
So a logic model is kind of what the name says, a logic model.

500
00:51:53,250 --> 00:52:03,000
It's a graphical representation of how the program works or how the health issue works.

501
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:09,570
So similar to like the health problem analysis that shares a lot of similarities with a logic model.

502
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:18,540
So like a logic model for an intervention would talk about things like our show, you know, what are some of the different background factors,

503
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:23,250
what populations are being impacted, what's needed for the intervention and things like that?

504
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:29,370
The second one program outcomes and objectives, and then a logic model of change.

505
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:34,799
So in this, you want to talk about what are the expected changes in terms of behavior,

506
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:39,690
in terms of environment, performance objectives, or what's going to actually happen?

507
00:52:39,690 --> 00:52:40,920
What are you going to do in this?

508
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:47,950
Look at it, determine determinants for behavioral environmental outcomes that are related to the health problem analysis.

509
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:54,209
This I don't always do constructive matrices of change objectives because when some people use this,

510
00:52:54,210 --> 00:52:59,700
they have those like again, big fancy, you know, models where this and this and that.

511
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:04,590
When I work in communities, we're like, we don't need all this is just like, what are we going to change?

512
00:53:04,590 --> 00:53:07,980
How are we going to do it? So I do it in a more modified way.

513
00:53:08,790 --> 00:53:13,260
Program design. So generate program themes, component, scope and sequence.

514
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:22,200
So that means of theme. You know, if, if we're going to do something and we make it fine, some interventions will have a theme.

515
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:29,250
So it could be a holiday theme, right? Or it could be a specific cultural theme or something else.

516
00:53:30,030 --> 00:53:38,190
We also what are the components? So are we going to have individual group, community, organization or combination?

517
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:44,970
You also need to choose a theory. We're not going to talk about theory in this class.

518
00:53:44,970 --> 00:53:51,060
There's whole classes on. On theory, but does anyone know what health behavior change theories are?

519
00:53:52,290 --> 00:54:02,210
The overall concept. Who would like to share that after someone said, yes, I would to say nothing.

520
00:54:02,990 --> 00:54:06,290
Anyone know what to help? Behavior change there is.

521
00:54:07,550 --> 00:54:10,980
Yeah. I'm not like. I just like you.

522
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:19,160
I don't think that talk about like like there's like the health of the theory of, like, social determination.

523
00:54:19,790 --> 00:54:27,349
Oh, so I kind of like the health belief model that talks about like, like the demographics, you know, like people trades and like pursue minds,

524
00:54:27,350 --> 00:54:37,120
perceive benefits maybe like and also includes like utility things that, you know, kind of stuff, all all lines.

525
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:46,040
It kind of just centers around the change that they need was a good since they

526
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:50,600
were presentation but again presentation that's a better way to help people.

527
00:54:50,750 --> 00:55:01,640
Yeah. So so help me with change models are frameworks that we use that attempt to predict what leads to changes in behavior.

528
00:55:01,940 --> 00:55:10,159
So held belief was like the oldest was actually developed here in the Department of Health Behavior Health Education back in the fifties.

529
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:14,930
I think, um, and there's a whole variety of different ones.

530
00:55:14,930 --> 00:55:20,600
What they, they're helpful for is thinking about what do we need to include in the intervention.

531
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:25,249
So things like and a lot of the models they have things like perceived threat.

532
00:55:25,250 --> 00:55:29,750
So if you don't perceive you're at risk for something, you're not going to change your behavior.

533
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:30,139
Right.

534
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:39,530
So if I'm talking about the dangers of, you know, hazardous substance use and you don't think that your intake of alcohol is hazardous or dangerous,

535
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:42,830
you're not going to move toward behavior change.

536
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:47,360
Other elements you often say to itself, efficacy.

537
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:51,860
So how much do you believe you can actually change your behavior?

538
00:55:52,100 --> 00:56:02,810
So there's a whole variety of different models that that explain behavior and those are really helpful and intervention development.

539
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:12,950
So with this, you really need to choose a theory that is going to be applicable for your community, for your population.

540
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:22,130
Also, if there are evidence based programs that exist, then you should look at those too.

541
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:27,140
So the thing is in public health is that we don't want to always reinvent the wheel.

542
00:56:27,590 --> 00:56:35,180
So if there's already a great diabetes prevention program out there, look at what they included and learn and grow from that.

543
00:56:35,180 --> 00:56:43,879
Don't start over from scratch. Also, we want to select a design practical application.

544
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:48,920
So again, one of the things we talked about is there going to be a dance element,

545
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:54,409
a group discussion, a critical analysis of a movie, things like that, and program production.

546
00:56:54,410 --> 00:56:59,979
You want to refine the program, structure an organization, prepare plans for program materials.

547
00:56:59,980 --> 00:57:07,080
So what are your materials look like? Are you going to have that going to use social, social media?

548
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:10,760
Or are you going to have different Instagram posts that you're going to use?

549
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:14,210
Or are you going to have a website or an app and things like that?

550
00:57:14,660 --> 00:57:22,280
Drafter, messages, materials and protocols. So, you know, you don't want to just develop something and then use it.

551
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:28,579
You want to do the next step, which is pretest it, refine it, and then produce the material.

552
00:57:28,580 --> 00:57:35,059
So let's say that we're doing in our in our group based activity,

553
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:43,160
we're going to do kind of a a game that helps you learn about risk for heart disease.

554
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:53,750
You know, if even if you have a team that's really talented and is working together on it, you may come up with something just isn't going to work.

555
00:57:54,110 --> 00:58:01,250
And so you really need to pilot test it. So when you pilot test it, you're going to learn what works and what doesn't work.

556
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:04,990
Do you understand that when I say pilot test, do you understand what that means? All right.

557
00:58:04,990 --> 00:58:09,140
I want to make sure I'm not using the intervention word in the wrong way.

558
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:13,430
So, yeah, so that's the program implementation plan.

559
00:58:13,430 --> 00:58:19,819
So like a lot of you were talking about, you were given a lot of great implementation recommendations.

560
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:27,740
Okay. So there's a difference between what you're developing in the program or the intervention and then how you're delivering it.

561
00:58:28,070 --> 00:58:30,740
So when we're thinking about program implementation,

562
00:58:30,980 --> 00:58:37,640
we're thinking about who are going to be the health educators or who's going to run the groups or who's going to run the the dance lessons,

563
00:58:37,930 --> 00:58:40,970
who is going to do this? Who's going to transport people?

564
00:58:41,750 --> 00:58:45,710
If you're working with, say, older adults and you're bringing them to a senior community center,

565
00:58:46,250 --> 00:58:55,460
who's going to drive them, you know, all those different things. So with program implementation, you want to look at the people who are going.

566
00:58:55,670 --> 00:59:03,800
To be receiving the intervention, but also the people who are going to be delivering it.

567
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:10,640
You want to look at the the UN, what your outcomes are, the performance objectives is what you're going to do.

568
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:22,549
So deliver six groups or deliver this or deliver that and then design the implementation intervention, the strategy for how you going to do it.

569
00:59:22,550 --> 00:59:25,610
And then the next step is about evaluation plan.

570
00:59:26,030 --> 00:59:33,079
So you want to look both at the outcome and process evaluation.

571
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:37,940
And I know the difference between a process evaluation and an outcome evaluation.

572
00:59:40,830 --> 00:59:43,110
You're all going to be intervention specialist after day.

573
00:59:44,070 --> 00:59:50,820
So the process, just like the name says, the process evaluation is the process of how you delivered the intervention.

574
00:59:51,330 --> 01:00:00,870
So you want to look at things like how well did the participants receive the person delivering the intervention?

575
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:05,040
So you're probably you'd give surveys at the end and ask questions like,

576
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:09,960
did you feel like the presenter was knowledgeable where they enter interactive?

577
01:00:10,170 --> 01:00:18,180
You know, all those kind of things. Also, you want to see to if you are incorporating art into it, you want to find out if your art was fine.

578
01:00:18,780 --> 01:00:25,170
You know, it could be you thought it was fun, but when you talked to the participants, it wasn't fun at all.

579
01:00:25,350 --> 01:00:28,140
So you need to make sure you're looking at both of those aspects.

580
01:00:29,670 --> 01:00:37,390
You also the outcome then outcomes, evaluations as actual changes in knowledge, attitudes, beliefs or behaviors.

581
01:00:37,890 --> 01:00:40,920
So cardiovascular risk.

582
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:49,980
Do people know what the factors are now? Are people changing their exercise patterns after the intervention?

583
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:55,110
Are people decreasing the amount of alcohol they're consuming?

584
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:59,580
So all those are the kind of things that you want to evaluate in the intervention.

585
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:09,870
Any questions on this at all? Yeah, a budget or do we have a budget for in general in life?

586
01:01:09,870 --> 01:01:14,070
You do it now for for this assignment.

587
01:01:14,370 --> 01:01:17,939
You do not have a budget. The last assignment.

588
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:22,640
You do have a budget. Okay. Sorry, but at least I didn't do it.

589
01:01:24,690 --> 01:01:32,860
Any other questions about this framework for again, I don't have a lot of practice.

590
01:01:33,330 --> 01:01:35,650
Yeah, that's a really great point.

591
01:01:35,670 --> 01:01:44,999
So the thing with intervention outcomes is that a lot of times we'll talk about short term, medium and then long term outcomes.

592
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:49,770
And for long term outcomes, people are usually talking about impact versus outcome.

593
01:01:50,430 --> 01:01:54,210
So yeah, you're right. So we're trying to change like rates of diabetes.

594
01:01:54,510 --> 01:01:57,810
We're not going to see that after delivering the intervention for six months.

595
01:01:58,260 --> 01:02:02,700
So a lot of times what you have to do is you have to measure precursors to that.

596
01:02:03,210 --> 01:02:08,670
So that's why changes in health behaviors and all those other kind of things,

597
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:14,970
because first you really have to change knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, then you change behaviors, then you change outcomes.

598
01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:24,900
So a lot of times in our interventions, we're not able to see the true effects for years, which makes again the field of prevention so hard.

599
01:02:25,170 --> 01:02:27,510
Because if we're trying to say, you know,

600
01:02:27,510 --> 01:02:37,830
this is a program to decrease type two diabetes among 35 to 55 year olds that decrease maybe five years down the road.

601
01:02:38,220 --> 01:02:43,379
So that's why we have to look at indicators are precursors as our outcomes excellent

602
01:02:43,380 --> 01:02:49,590
measurement that is in the short term would be super subjective based on should they fail.

603
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:55,650
Yeah. So that's another great question. It's really based on the existing data.

604
01:02:55,950 --> 01:03:07,950
So if we know scientifically really well that changing eating behavior results in a 75% shift based on whether studies have been done,

605
01:03:08,670 --> 01:03:15,900
that's usually what you want to use to determine. Yeah, but that's a really excellent question because and there's always some degree of subjectivity.

606
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:22,950
You know, some people will look at things like sometimes they'll try and use biomarkers for things.

607
01:03:23,910 --> 01:03:26,910
So you might want to look at like if you're looking at diabetes,

608
01:03:26,910 --> 01:03:32,580
you might want to look at I like hostel weighted hemoglobin and all these other kind of things as,

609
01:03:32,580 --> 01:03:40,440
as markers for changes and like blood sugar levels and those things you can look at increasing more and more

610
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:48,389
interventions are trying to look at biomarkers like you can look at stress biomarkers so you can take in hair samples,

611
01:03:48,390 --> 01:03:51,360
blood samples, you can actually look at stress levels.

612
01:03:51,750 --> 01:03:59,670
So that's one way that you can, because we know over time with sustained high levels of stress, we have a lot of negative health outcomes.

613
01:04:00,060 --> 01:04:03,540
So we can look at those biomarkers. Yeah.

614
01:04:03,810 --> 01:04:12,900
Or even like, yeah. So because I'm working on a study in DC where we're looking at biomarkers and so we're looking at like cortisol levels.

615
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:24,149
There's also I don't I'm not on that part of the team, you know, but anyway, there's a bunch of other ones but like, you know,

616
01:04:24,150 --> 01:04:28,709
more and more interventions are doing like what's called dried blood spots where they're

617
01:04:28,710 --> 01:04:33,060
taking some of your blood and then they can analyze the blood later to look at that.

618
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:37,950
With the one intervention in Kenya, we actually are looking at prep levels.

619
01:04:38,190 --> 01:04:46,220
And so we actually take people's. Blood at the follow up points, and then we can see how much circulating drug they have in their body.

620
01:04:47,180 --> 01:04:51,049
And so a lot of times when we're doing especially more research interventions,

621
01:04:51,050 --> 01:05:00,530
you'll have multiple follow up assessments and you know, even up to a year later to see if there's a difference.

622
01:05:01,460 --> 01:05:06,720
These are all great questions. Any other questions right now?

623
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:13,470
So one and we're almost out of time. I was going to say real world uses of this.

624
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:19,640
I'll do this real super quick. This is an intervention we did in Mozambique.

625
01:05:20,540 --> 01:05:28,130
And this was a nine session adolescent disclosure intervention that uses a theory based, developmentally appropriate framework, blah, blah, blah.

626
01:05:28,700 --> 01:05:34,400
The what the how this came about is that in Mozambique,

627
01:05:34,820 --> 01:05:44,870
the shame around HIV is so incredibly intense that a number of mothers who are living with HIV,

628
01:05:45,080 --> 01:05:55,100
who then passed the virus on during pregnancy and childbirth, would not tell their child that they were having HIV because of the stigma, the shame.

629
01:05:55,340 --> 01:06:05,960
So we had lots of kids that were running around with HIV and they were told they had either a blood disorder or some other kind of thing,

630
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:07,760
and that's why they had to take medication.

631
01:06:08,330 --> 01:06:14,930
Now, this group was aging into adolescence and becoming sexually active, and they didn't know that they were living with HIV.

632
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:20,839
So we were brought in. We worked with a place called Children's Place International in Almodovar,

633
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:25,280
which is in Mozambique, and they're part of the International Planned Parenthood Federation,

634
01:06:26,810 --> 01:06:37,730
which is why this program ended, because when Trump came into office, he cut all aid to international organizations that promoted abortion.

635
01:06:39,740 --> 01:06:42,230
And they lost 60% of their funding. So anyway,

636
01:06:42,650 --> 01:06:54,740
so what we did and this just shows you some of the processes that we did to work through using a bit of a modification of the mapping process,

637
01:06:54,740 --> 01:07:00,770
but a lot of engagement, involvement with people in the community.

638
01:07:00,980 --> 01:07:07,250
We also had to think about language differences too, because the primary language is Portuguese,

639
01:07:07,460 --> 01:07:11,690
so and it's a different kind of Portuguese agency in other places.

640
01:07:12,140 --> 01:07:15,770
So these processes take a long time.

641
01:07:16,550 --> 01:07:22,430
And then even with like this, we only did our pilot with ten families because it was a pretty intensive intervention.

642
01:07:22,970 --> 01:07:27,230
And so, like one of the big outcomes was disclosure, because that's what we were trying to do,

643
01:07:27,230 --> 01:07:31,820
is to get parents comfortable disclosing to their child that the child was living with HIV.

644
01:07:32,270 --> 01:07:39,470
And we did find with this that all ten of the families in the pilot did disclose to the children and maybe say, say, oh, that's only ten.

645
01:07:39,830 --> 01:07:46,070
But given the huge stigma that exists, it was really pretty phenomenal.

646
01:07:46,190 --> 01:07:46,669
And again,

647
01:07:46,670 --> 01:08:02,510
this was all this is another diagram that shows a little bit about kind of how you you do this this process and did working with this intervention.

648
01:08:03,020 --> 01:08:08,929
So just to kind of take our message on this intervention, mapping can be really useful.

649
01:08:08,930 --> 01:08:13,130
It's very useful framework. But this stuff is very, very time consuming.

650
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:22,970
With this, it took us about three, two years in the development process, doing all the pilot, testing all the development,

651
01:08:23,330 --> 01:08:28,010
also having everything in Portuguese and in English and then also in local language,

652
01:08:28,430 --> 01:08:34,220
because there's also words like some local languages in the different areas, working with graphic designers.

653
01:08:34,460 --> 01:08:43,460
So we had a whole all of our materials were for the families were not there was no written words.

654
01:08:43,460 --> 01:08:46,760
It was all images because there were low literacy levels.

655
01:08:47,180 --> 01:08:52,780
So thinking about that, how do we take concepts and put them into pictures and then pilot touch that?

656
01:08:52,790 --> 01:08:57,680
So it's a lot of work, but in the end you end up getting much better results.

657
01:08:59,240 --> 01:09:02,660
So you're probably thinking, okay, where's the CRC?

658
01:09:02,670 --> 01:09:10,610
I know some of you came to class just for that, but what we're going to talk about is the final assignment.

659
01:09:11,510 --> 01:09:20,330
There's nothing to look at up there, so you've got to have a look at the board. So your final assignment is it's online, so it's under assignment.

660
01:09:20,540 --> 01:09:33,080
So in your final assignment, you will be writing a proposal for the development and implementation of a public health intervention.

661
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:45,170
So if you look at online and you look at the instructions, I guess I could show that we set it up like a real grant proposal.

662
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:52,970
So you will be working in groups and you will be responding.

663
01:09:54,950 --> 01:10:02,600
Okay. So your final assignment will actually be the the grant proposal.

664
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:17,660
I would take some time to look through this once it's written up like what's called an RFP, an RFA request for proposals or request for.

665
01:10:18,710 --> 01:10:23,890
Oh, anyway, another thing and what you'll be doing in this,

666
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:29,990
you do have more of a restrictive budget and now we don't expect you to know exactly how much things cost.

667
01:10:30,290 --> 01:10:37,220
It's just kind of give me a general framework and you will have to write this up in full sentences.

668
01:10:37,490 --> 01:10:42,889
So I know everything's been bullets before, but it's been building up, as I talked about before.

669
01:10:42,890 --> 01:10:48,350
Each assignment builds on the next. It's building up to writing a full grant proposal.

670
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:57,409
It'll have a cover page, an abstract. You'll talk about the public health issue and we give you approximate page limits the population of focus.

671
01:10:57,410 --> 01:11:00,680
So it's looking very similar to what you you're doing in this assignment.

672
01:11:01,010 --> 01:11:07,040
You'll have your intervention objectives. One new section will be the intervention development process.

673
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:09,860
So how are you going to make this culturally appropriate,

674
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:16,189
the intervention activities and then also intervention implementation, which you don't have in this one.

675
01:11:16,190 --> 01:11:19,520
But we just talked about who's going to deliver it? How are they going to deliver it?

676
01:11:20,690 --> 01:11:28,460
10 to 30 references and then the appendices. So this is a much bigger project than what you've done before.

677
01:11:28,820 --> 01:11:38,690
So you'll be working in groups of 3 to 4. I put a jam board up with different populations and different health issues.

678
01:11:39,350 --> 01:11:46,040
And we're going to leave it up to you all to find each other and create a group.

679
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:54,350
In the past, I used to have people kind of an interest sheet, and then we would stand for hours trying to match everyone.

680
01:11:54,860 --> 01:11:58,670
Now, so we're doing the jam board.

681
01:11:59,030 --> 01:12:03,169
Just write your name on different, you know, topic areas.

682
01:12:03,170 --> 01:12:07,940
I have some issues and some populations supporting each other.

683
01:12:08,390 --> 01:12:11,870
If you want this, just be your friends. That's fine.

684
01:12:12,060 --> 01:12:17,060
You want to work with your enemies? That's fine. But find a group.

685
01:12:17,330 --> 01:12:22,520
And then now hopefully you can get into the document.

686
01:12:23,630 --> 01:12:27,290
Yeah, actually, yeah, you can.

687
01:12:27,290 --> 01:12:40,100
You get it now? Okay. Yeah. So give us your groups and put right now what your what you're thinking your, your project beyond.

688
01:12:40,340 --> 01:12:49,550
But that can change. Okay. So you may put down diabetes prevention with Mexican-American immigrants.

689
01:12:50,510 --> 01:12:54,329
And as your group meets and you start talking, you decide.

690
01:12:54,330 --> 01:12:58,700
Then you want to work with black transgender women in Detroit.

691
01:12:58,760 --> 01:13:02,930
That's totally fine, because in the past, some people put that down like, we have to stick to this.

692
01:13:03,230 --> 01:13:06,950
You don't have to say to us, as long as it meets the guidelines, that's all you have to do.

693
01:13:07,700 --> 01:13:10,790
Anyone have any questions about this?

694
01:13:10,790 --> 01:13:17,180
Yeah. Why do we need to have, like, groups finalized by. Oh, it would be great if you could do it by the end of next week.

695
01:13:17,900 --> 01:13:21,110
So gives you a week to, you know, kind of talk to people.

696
01:13:22,430 --> 01:13:28,309
Any other questions? I was going to leave a little more time to talk to people now.

697
01:13:28,310 --> 01:13:34,030
But, you know, we ended up with a comedy show and a class are at a time.

698
01:13:34,050 --> 01:13:39,500
Again, this could be one of those things where people are laughing at you, not with you, but, you know, any questions?

699
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:47,000
I'm not we're not going to go through the grant proposal guidelines like we did the other.

700
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:52,820
SIMON And here go through one by one. But next week, we will answer questions about it.

701
01:13:53,090 --> 01:14:01,640
All right. Also, keep in mind, there's a difference between your next assignment, which is individual and your final assignment, which is group.

702
01:14:02,210 --> 01:14:09,110
Last year, I had two groups that did the next assignment as a group and I was wrong.

703
01:14:09,650 --> 01:14:15,890
All right. So have a great weekend. Have a good rest of your days and local government planning.

704
01:14:19,530 --> 01:14:23,610
So I did.

705
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:50,730
And. Oh, yeah.

706
01:14:52,740 --> 01:15:07,650
Oh, yeah, I, I, I, you know, I don't know.

707
01:15:07,780 --> 01:15:34,680
Why don't you say like, you're like, oh, that's nice.

708
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:52,560
Yeah. I feel like you have to be one person.

709
01:15:55,560 --> 01:16:17,350
I think you accidentally feel like they're going to retaliate.

710
01:16:18,360 --> 01:16:35,130
Benefits. I, I feel like I've never had an interest for someone like that.

711
01:16:40,130 --> 01:16:55,970
Like I was like, oh, it was like for you to do that.

712
01:16:56,940 --> 01:17:02,670
Oh, yeah. Yeah. And what I want is to wrap my mind in the group.

713
01:17:03,150 --> 01:17:13,380
But yeah, yeah. Hopefully be somebody is a man who like, he's a great place to live.

714
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:16,860
Like since the first time they have all the money,

715
01:17:16,870 --> 01:17:31,140
like have the house down to my baby or some other than that I really don't know what it is, but I have had the right man.

716
01:17:31,770 --> 01:17:49,200
But, you know. Yeah. It's just a just like, you know, like, really, you know, you want to be creative and then again, it thinks it's gonna.

717
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:57,029
No, I know. It's like it's like sitting there saying, hey, what is that like?

718
01:17:57,030 --> 01:17:58,320
I don't know. Yeah, he has.

719
01:17:58,830 --> 01:18:17,290
And the first day people like, it's like it's like it's just like, you know, they all say that this is how you would do that before developing it.

720
01:18:17,340 --> 01:18:24,790
Also, we have not you know, there's no no, no.

721
01:18:26,700 --> 01:18:39,850
I mean, I'm like, no. Point is I don't know what you enjoy here, but I don't know.

722
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:52,020
I think like. Yeah, like I have to sign up for different places, like built environment where like,

723
01:18:52,020 --> 01:19:00,320
you know, not like know I don't like I can tell you right now, I can't say that.

724
01:19:02,120 --> 01:19:05,940
I have no idea where to go.

725
01:19:06,450 --> 01:19:13,450
I don't sign up for our you know, you have a right to like this lady.

726
01:19:13,470 --> 01:19:31,470
And but there is also like all that stuff like, you know, like and then also learning about like, yeah, I'll have it could be a lot.

727
01:19:31,740 --> 01:19:36,200
Okay yeah like if you can't things my name.

728
01:19:37,260 --> 01:19:43,590
And doing it like, you know, like small groups like, you know, you can pull of like that where like you want to do one day.

729
01:19:44,290 --> 01:19:50,690
I don't really like birthdays.

730
01:19:50,780 --> 01:19:56,300
Like, yeah, I had done a lot of research on it.

731
01:19:56,310 --> 01:19:59,700
Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah, I was sorry. I know, I know.

732
01:19:59,830 --> 01:20:02,400
Yeah, but let's do everything in my knowledge.

733
01:20:03,380 --> 01:20:18,440
I have this nasal swab, and, you know, I'm still being trained, and I think that's part of their rights and they're learning by everybody.

734
01:20:18,710 --> 01:20:27,390
And then, you know, maybe there's like a set of different accents, like, how do we do all that kind of progress after?

735
01:20:27,390 --> 01:20:43,650
Like, how long will it take you to say, Right, sorry so early?
