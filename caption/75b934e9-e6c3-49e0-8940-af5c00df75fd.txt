1
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:07,009
Okay. So in warning everyone in some projects in trouble.

2
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:14,780
So I'll give it a minute and then I'll try again. So I hope you all have good things going on.

3
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:19,000
Thanks for those for networking sites.

4
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:25,980
So luckily we just have two lectures left there, both guest lectures, so you can still make it next week.

5
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:30,010
I think that would be interesting that John is coming back on Thursday.

6
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:39,330
She's going to give us an overview of kind of how we apply epigenetics and gene expression data in addition to genetics.

7
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:50,709
She's going to give examples from our lab. So that's like more of a kind of more research focused presentation.

8
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:57,630
And I think it will be interesting. And then Tuesday, the last day we have Rory coming, she works.

9
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:05,400
She's going to her research on epigenetics of cancers that specifically in pediatrics.

10
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:11,690
So I think that would be interesting to see this.

11
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:30,549
I did give you back the Greeks, for example, to give back to those that were so intense about that.

12
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:41,740
And the comments for at least four problems set for like make sure to look over the comments even if you've got a full point

13
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:49,899
because I tried to give as much as possible and I'm sure you'll likely have something similar in the exam in exam three.

14
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:53,590
So I'm asking you not to go through a whole paper.

15
00:01:53,980 --> 00:02:01,640
This is working. So not not go through a full paper, but kind of answer a few questions.

16
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:06,820
A lot of people messed up on the research question,

17
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:14,140
so make sure to specify like what whether they were looking genome wide or whether we're looking at specific genes.

18
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:20,200
Make sure to specify this phenotype. So what what's the outcome that they were looking at?

19
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,330
And then if you can specify the population. So who were they looking at it?

20
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:31,840
Was it whites? Was it just males? Was it multi ancestry population?

21
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,989
So so think about s three components.

22
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:39,760
Make sure to hit all those three points. What else?

23
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:46,690
Some people messed up on trying to decide whether the outcome was quantitative or qualitative.

24
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:52,270
So think about quantitative as a continuous measure.

25
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:55,360
So like height that's continuous or weight.

26
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:57,790
So wait,

27
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:09,969
we can analyze it as the actual weight in kilograms and then that that would make it a quantitative trait if we are to create categories out of it.

28
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:17,290
So if we were to kind of classify people as maybe normal versus obese or overweight,

29
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:22,180
then we're creating two levels that would make it a qualitative measure.

30
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:31,570
Okay, so make sure you understand the difference between those two and then whenever asked the phenotype of interest,

31
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:35,080
that's like the main outcome or the main disease that we're looking at.

32
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:39,600
Not that like the background work they did together.

33
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:51,010
So. And then it kind of gets tricky trying to like if I ask what's the p value threshold that that was applied?

34
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:54,790
Um, I would give as much details as possible.

35
00:03:54,790 --> 00:04:02,590
Like if it was an, if you give a p value. Make sure to say whether it was in the discovery sample application.

36
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,049
If you want to report one,

37
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:13,510
maybe report them to one for the meta analysis or the final one that they were that they used to kind of report the results.

38
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,360
Same applies for frequencies.

39
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:29,499
Like try to apply try to provide details whether you're like, given like the minor, the major in cases and controls in the full sample.

40
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:35,620
So try to give as much details as possible for those so you can get the credit for questions.

41
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:39,280
Um, and those are the main points.

42
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:47,310
I feel like people, and then like whenever I ask, what's the analysis, that would be the main analysis that they did.

43
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:55,170
So the analysis looking at the. Snips of the genetic variants and the main outcome.

44
00:04:55,170 --> 00:05:07,650
And so that's like the analysis that you want to specify, like the subsequent analysis or additional analysis that clear any question that.

45
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:23,390
Okay. So. So you also had, like a cancer lecture to watch.

46
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:27,260
I don't know if anyone has any questions or no.

47
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,500
Okay. So I didn't realize that the guide for Exam three.

48
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:35,460
So. So that would be helpful. I hope.

49
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:43,140
How helpful was it, for example, to. But it's it's kind of it's along the same lines an exam study would be.

50
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:50,639
So we won't have class next Thursday and you would have the exam to work on similar to what

51
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:58,920
we did for exam to it's not comprehensive it's going to cover the G was part so we kind.

52
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:08,200
Cancer gene interaction and then that genetics and you exit from the clues is here.

53
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:14,080
It is a mix of multiple choice and kind of open ended questions as well.

54
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,720
I know some maybe I feel like some people ran out of time for them to.

55
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:23,790
So. Try to plan.

56
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:28,480
For example, you think about the same plan. I.

57
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:42,840
Any questions? Oh, so let's talk about these clients.

58
00:06:50,640 --> 00:07:06,430
It's. So.

59
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,410
So today we're going to be talking about epigenetics.

60
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:21,309
I'm going to you kind of touched upon epigenetics early on in the study when we were reading the paper and

61
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:30,639
talking about the importance of regulation of how much and how much of the genes are being expressed,

62
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:36,550
how open the DNA is for transcription. But today we'll talk about it many more details.

63
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:48,459
We'll talk about kind of the. So the molecular aspect of it and then some animal studies that looked at it.

64
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:56,860
And then as I said, Jen, we'll probably talk about real life examples of how we use epigenetic data and our lab.

65
00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:02,620
And then Laurie will talk about the role of the epigenome in pediatric cancers.

66
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:11,650
So so the epigenetic epigenome is kind of interesting.

67
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:18,310
Like if you would break the word AP means like on top and then the genome is like the genetics.

68
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:26,440
So it's so it's really translates to that kind of layer of information that you have on top of the genes.

69
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:33,430
And what is interesting is that it's not related to the actual DNA code,

70
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:45,520
like almost everything we've talked about so far was related to changes maybe in the code or changes in the sequence or mutation or deletion.

71
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:53,800
But this is a kind of a set of information that would regulate how much of that how that would regulate gene expression.

72
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:56,220
It's not in the code per say.

73
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:05,560
So it's so these are heritable changes in the gene in gene expression that occur without actually changing the DNA sequence itself.

74
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:11,140
And we will kind of dissect this term heritable a little bit more.

75
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:16,840
Usually when people think about heritable, they think about like from parent to offspring.

76
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:25,630
But I mean, like generation wise. But it's that part of inheritance, of the DNA of the epigenome is kind of controversial.

77
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:34,840
But when we say heritable, that means when a cell divides whatever kind of epigenetic information it has or the epigenetic signature it has,

78
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:40,400
it is transmitted to the daughters cells, but not necessarily like from a father son.

79
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:47,800
There's some evidence of that, but it's still not very kind of, well, well-developed theory.

80
00:09:48,420 --> 00:10:03,329
Okay. So some of the kind of earliest experiments that show epigenetic differences and how much they can affect how how the phenotype looks,

81
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:14,800
that comes from the agouti mind. So these mice that are that have mice that have the exact same DNA sequence, so they are identical.

82
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:19,180
But just because one gene is turned on, one gene is turned off.

83
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:26,259
We have mice that have a lighter color and they are more obese than the other type.

84
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:29,860
That is that is not and that is just based on the epigenome.

85
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:34,150
So what genes are being actively expressed and what are not?

86
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:40,740
And then in humans, the animal studies that we do know has been found,

87
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:49,389
like changes in the epigenome or changes in epigenetic information has been found to be associated with lots of conditions like asthma,

88
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:54,640
cardiovascular disease, schizophrenia. And this is like a growing list, like BMI,

89
00:10:54,940 --> 00:11:05,620
diabetes or all conditions that we show that differences in how this epigenome is is associated with those outcomes.

90
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:18,580
And then something to kind of keep in mind as we talk about the epigenome is that it's not those changes are not kind of set in stone.

91
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:22,660
It's not like the DNA code that we know came before.

92
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:31,780
Like if we if we were to look at the association between the DNA sequence and BMI, we would know for sure that the relationship it goes that way.

93
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:37,899
It's like DNA sequence to the BMI versus when we're looking at the epigenome.

94
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:48,460
We do not know whether changes in BMI caused the epigenome to change or whether the changes in the epigenome kind of resulted in changes in BMI.

95
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:57,820
So this is kind of one of the challenges of epigenetic studies is that we don't know necessarily the section of the arrow which way it is going.

96
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:07,290
Is that clear? I think it's become clear what I mean by that, you know, as we kind of go through the lecture today.

97
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:14,120
So so the epigenome, in addition to what I just talked about,

98
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:24,190
like the role of the epigenome in gene expression and the bigger scale of things, the display of information decides how cells differentiate.

99
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:29,220
So we all know that all the cells in our bodies have the same DNA sequence,

100
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:33,900
but of course we do end up with different types of cells, like the muscle cells.

101
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:39,720
We have blood cells, neurons, so they all kind of have the same code,

102
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:44,760
but they end up differentiating differently and that is controlled by the epigenome.

103
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:55,110
So Waddington here kind of develop this epigenetic landscape and imagine like a cell that is

104
00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:03,299
not differentiated as the marble rolling down downhill and then as the marble kind of scrolls,

105
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:13,980
it has different paths that it can take. And then the further this the cell is down this landscape, the less options there are.

106
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:22,230
And then once it kind of lands in a valley, then that's when the cell kind of is set and fully differentiated.

107
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:27,060
And in in in cells. Think of it as a cell that's kind of.

108
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:35,130
I got, I don't know, a stem cell or cell that has not been kind of did not commit yet to a certain cell type.

109
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:39,780
You have the epigenome controlling certain genes.

110
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:48,330
So these genes are expressed and then these genes will express protein products that will turn on other genes.

111
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:57,330
And so the cell kind of makes its paths so that it's more specialized and it's all based on the epigenome and what genes are being turned on,

112
00:13:57,330 --> 00:14:00,420
what genes are being turned off? Is that clear?

113
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:20,509
So so this is kind of what I talked about and beginning so that we epigenetics is the study of mitotic inheritable

114
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:29,410
so in a cell divides it storage cells kind of carry the same epigenetic signature and it's potentially reversible.

115
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:41,810
So in theory, physiologically, we know that whatever information is being carried, it can be removed or it can be reversed.

116
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:46,400
That's different than the genetic code per se, which we know can't be changed.

117
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:50,300
It can improve in the lifespan of human.

118
00:14:52,100 --> 00:15:01,340
So these changes result in gene regulate controlled gene regulation all outside of changes to the DNA sequence.

119
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:15,679
So we have we observed cell to cell transmission and then we kind of divide that epigenetic information to two main types.

120
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:22,460
So when I say epigenetics, it could be either type of DNA methylation or histone modification.

121
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,380
And we will talk about those to today.

122
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:38,130
And then if we were just to kind of step back and think about how the the like the epigenome in the genetic context,

123
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:47,430
remember that the the DNA or the chromosomes, the DNA sequence itself is not just randomly sitting in the cell.

124
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,510
It has a highly organized folding structure.

125
00:15:51,510 --> 00:16:02,850
And this folding structure is very important in terms of kind of deciding what what regions are accessible, what regions are not.

126
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:11,430
That affects regulation. So it affects what is being expressed but is easily transcribed by the cell machinery.

127
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:23,490
It can also result and say you have two different genes or two different parts of the chromosome that are far away from each other.

128
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:30,810
But just the way just because of the way it is folded, they could end up being kind of on top of each other.

129
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:34,170
And that's actually also highly regulated,

130
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:41,970
like what is kind of interacting with what and it could be on you could have for

131
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,280
like kind of faraway parts of the of the genome just because of how it's folded,

132
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,860
then they are interacting.

133
00:16:49,710 --> 00:17:02,460
And then the this packing of the DNA can also result in parts that are closer to the nucleus being now very not very expressed

134
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:11,370
or not very accessible versus parts that are kind of further out that are more open to transcription and translation.

135
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:17,280
So, so although as all this to say is that the packaging of the DNA is,

136
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:24,209
is kind of an important piece of it and it can create challenges and opportunities for regulation of gene.

137
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:27,990
Transcription. Any questions so far?

138
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:47,980
Okay. And then. And I said, like, the, the, the, the, the differentiation of cells is a result of the epigenome or epigenetic changes.

139
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:53,540
So as you can imagine, a cell that is from a muscle tissue will have a difference,

140
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:59,480
a different epigenetic landscape or epigenetic signature from a cell in the brain.

141
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:09,350
So we know that although there's one genome, one DNA sequence, the epigenome information can be different in different cells.

142
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:25,630
So this plot here shows like what DNA methylation looks like on one single chromosome across different tissues.

143
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:33,850
So each ring here represents a different cell type.

144
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:42,550
I think the other one is is muscles trying to find exactly where you can find that information here.

145
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:49,940
So yeah, you have muscle cells, sperm cells.

146
00:18:49,950 --> 00:19:03,950
So so then the idea is that is kind of what I was just saying, different cells in the, in the body would have different epigenetic kind of landscape.

147
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:09,920
Okay. That's based on what genes it is actively expressing what genes it is not.

148
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:24,660
Um, okay. So we talked about how like the two main components of epigenetics or epigenetic information are DNA methylation and histone modification.

149
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:36,960
So what do I mean by DNA methylation? So DNA methylation is the addition of a methyl group to a cytosine base.

150
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:43,340
And this status in base of the DNA is usually followed by a guanine.

151
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:55,440
So we call a DNA methylation site, a CPG site, so that P denoting the phosphorous linking those two nucleotides together.

152
00:19:56,610 --> 00:20:04,049
So this is one mechanism of of one type of epigenetic information.

153
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:14,190
So it's called DNA methylation. And this is the enzyme that would kind of add this methyl group to the cytosine is DNA methyltransferase.

154
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:25,230
And then you have byproducts where you have tiny and being changed to homocysteine as a as a as a byproduct for this reaction.

155
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:39,649
Okay. So when we look across the genome, we can kind of see, oh, this C base is methylated versus like maybe in another person it is not.

156
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:45,020
And we can try to look at this location with a disease or an outcome of interest.

157
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:58,590
Okay. So this is just basically kind of an expansion of what I just showed of how the methyl group is kind of produced here.

158
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:11,100
And it comes and it plays a role in isolation. It also plays a role in in producing purines and pyrimidine other proteins and lipids.

159
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:20,010
You don't really have to know this. It's just to show that it is quite a kind of a big pathway.

160
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:26,520
And as you can see here, you also have kind of.

161
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:35,350
Nutrient factors like folic acid and choline that are that play a role in this pathway.

162
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:43,900
Some of these, like the choline, could be kind of called a methyl group donor or kind of helps the body produce methyl groups.

163
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:59,200
And it kind of helps you link and link and see how DNA methylation can actually be kind of triggered or are or affected by environmental factors.

164
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:08,770
So in this case, that would be like nutrition. So so things that you could eat could potentially especially mean not probably in adults,

165
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:18,700
but things and but in in in the in embryo or like in like in early life stages.

166
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:30,400
This can help us kind of understand how the environment can affect how those epigenetic signatures are produced or not.

167
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:42,610
Okay. The questions. The thing about the thing about the epigenome is that we think about it as being very highly sensitive to the environment.

168
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:49,060
Just because it's not part of the code, it's kind of responsive to the environment.

169
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:55,270
And we will talk about other studies that have shown how this kind of comes through.

170
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:04,340
So we talked about those scientists in bases that have a metal base on them.

171
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:13,520
So typically we think about methylated CPG sites, especially if they are in the promoter region of a gene.

172
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:22,310
We think about those as genes that are kind of turned on or that they are being expressed.

173
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:35,280
Versus if you have a methylated CPG site in the promoter region, we we tend to think that this gene is turned off or inactivated by DNA methylation.

174
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:45,930
Now, if you have the the CPGs or the DNA methylation site in different regions outside of the gene gene,

175
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:54,150
but in the like or say in the gene body or downstream, then the effects on gene expression is not as easily predictable.

176
00:23:55,140 --> 00:24:06,800
Okay. So how does having this muscle base an insight to same kind of affect transcription.

177
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:14,280
So we think that this can happen through two pathways, two ways, two ways.

178
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:17,959
So one is blocking the acts of transcription factors.

179
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:23,600
So just having the metal group can actually prevent the binding of the transcription factor.

180
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:31,040
So physically kind of stop the transcription factor from attaching and expressing the gene.

181
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:36,500
Or it could be by having this muscle,

182
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:48,810
you can attract other proteins that would kind of attach and also inhibit transcription and kind of modify the whole chromatin structure you can.

183
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:57,650
Now those DNA methylation sites,

184
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:08,299
we would if they are found in a kind of a high density region so that you have a region where you have a lot of CPG sites,

185
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:15,620
then we would call those CPG islands. So these are areas where you have a high density of CPG.

186
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:19,790
Is there not very common in the human body?

187
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:29,589
Probably broken down by evolution. Most of these CPG sites in our body are methylated,

188
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:39,940
so they are kind of have that methyl group and unventilated CPG sites tend to be found clustered together in those CPG islands.

189
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:42,230
Right.

190
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:56,410
And those CPG islands are commonly found in the promotes regions of the genes and about 40% of the genes have a CPG island in their promoter region.

191
00:25:57,270 --> 00:26:02,990
Okay, maybe this one will kind of help you visualize that better.

192
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:07,570
So if you're looking across the genome,

193
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:21,460
say this is one gene and with its enhancer and promoter regions and then those marks here are the DNA methylation, the CPG sites.

194
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:27,790
So they could be found across the gut anywhere,

195
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:40,420
kind of on the gene body or in the transcription start side or kind of closer to the gene or upstream from the gene.

196
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:54,250
And then if we kind of zoom in on this kind of region, we can see that this high density region of the of DNA methylation sites is the CPG islands.

197
00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:00,550
And then we kind of break it down into shores, kind of away from that island.

198
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:06,100
And this this is located in the promoter region of the genes.

199
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:11,170
The CPG island, it's not really in the gene body or towards the end of the gene.

200
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:19,310
Okay. Any questions?

201
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:24,260
Is that clear? Yeah. Is CPG just sitting next to each other?

202
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:34,249
Yes. I think the yeah. There the P there's like you don't want to think see across from the G, it's like we're reading on the same strands.

203
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:37,280
So see and then the phosphors finding them and then the chain.

204
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:44,270
Yeah. Yeah. And then you would have the methyl group that can be added to the C and that would make it a CPG site.

205
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,519
Yeah. Yeah. It sounds like more complex than it is,

206
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:57,650
but it's basically like the DNA sequence and you have those signatures on the C that would help guide the gene expression.

207
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:04,470
And now there are questions of sorts.

208
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:12,700
If the significance of CPG islands and shelves and shows like in the gene, it's just where they're densest or.

209
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:24,489
Yes. Yes. They're just like like let's say you find CPG sites that is kind of interesting or is associated with an outcome.

210
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:27,940
We kind of look back and see where it is located.

211
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:36,669
Like if it's in the CPG island, if it's close to the gene, it kind of helps us understand it's what it does.

212
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:39,159
Like if it's if it's in the gene promoter region,

213
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:48,700
then we know it is actually that makes sense that it's associated with differences in gene expression versus if it's in the gene body,

214
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:58,359
then it's not then likely it's I mean, it's not not but it's kind of trickier to understand how it's related and then the

215
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:04,180
islands kind of the way how we kind of the organizational structure of those CPG sites.

216
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:14,560
Any other thoughts or question? Okay.

217
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:26,639
So so this is kind of one type of the epigenetic information that is actually the one we kind of mostly use.

218
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,270
And it's easier to understand just because you can measure it more easily.

219
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:32,309
It's like a quantitative measure.

220
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:41,480
You would look at the site and you were able to say, this is like 50% methylated in across all my samples versus not.

221
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:48,870
So the other type of information that kind of regulates gene expression is histone modifications.

222
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:58,630
So remember that histones are those proteins around which the DNA is wrapped.

223
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:03,490
They form the nucleosome, so they are you.

224
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:07,510
There are four types of histones. They.

225
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:11,530
They form an h shaped kind of.

226
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:22,300
They form an eight sheets and eight, eight, eight parts to mirror that around which the DNA is wrapped.

227
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:27,399
And then there are mostly four types.

228
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:35,020
We think that there are mostly four types of histones. So those are two different proteins, h two, h two, v, h three and h four.

229
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:43,390
Okay. And those histones that are the proteins and which have tails that kind of extend.

230
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:58,010
And those tails are. Our places where proteins can be added, and that would affect the folding of the DNA.

231
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:02,820
Okay. Is that clear? So those are the histones.

232
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:13,340
Those are the proteins. They do have kind of a tail at which proteins can attach and also affect things.

233
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:26,110
So if we if we look at this kind of figure here, those histones are positively charged and the DNA sequence itself is negatively charged.

234
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:32,900
So. So that would kind of create a chicken they would attract.

235
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:39,139
And then they are kind of a closed unit. So it's not open to transcription.

236
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:41,240
So it's transcription only repressed.

237
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:52,700
Now, by adding acetylation marks to those histone tails that I talked about that would neutralize that positive charge on the histones.

238
00:31:53,810 --> 00:32:03,480
So those two parts are now negatively charged and they kind of what's the word for?

239
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:16,710
They don't interact. They're kind of. That's the word that kind of propelled it, propelling each other and kind of open to transcription.

240
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:22,410
And that's just by adding those acetylation marks. Okay.

241
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:26,400
Is that clear? So is this.

242
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:31,910
This kind of information is more of now very quantitative.

243
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:35,270
It's like having a mark versus not having a mark.

244
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:48,560
And then there are, as you can like the way this information is described, we would kind of have to know first which histone we're talking about.

245
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:57,020
Remember, there are four types. We kind of have to describe which are which amino acid we're talking about,

246
00:32:57,020 --> 00:33:03,830
which location and then the type of the mark that that we can have is also different.

247
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:13,190
You could have phosphorylation acetylation, you'd have methylation, different type of marks that can be added to those histones.

248
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:24,980
And also they end up having different effects, like some are repressive, some are kind of more of.

249
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:31,370
Activate Transcription. Okay.

250
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:44,400
Any question need. Okay.

251
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:49,530
So. So.

252
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:58,460
So if we want to think about epigenetic changes versus a mutation, so the first thing we can do,

253
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:06,079
we could probably agree on is that a mutation is a change in the actual code versus a epigenetic change.

254
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:15,620
Is that like kind of a a protein or mark added somewhere that would affect gene expression without changes of a code.

255
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:27,800
So let's think about this tumor suppressor gene p53 you have here the DNA methylation sites if you have a mutation.

256
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:34,740
So a change in the DNA sequence and actual change, you can have a malfunctioning or a truncated gene product.

257
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:41,060
It will definitely I mean, depending on. But let's assume that we it would cause a malfunctioning protein.

258
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:52,050
Now, this mutation will likely be. Inherited across the cells, potentially across generations.

259
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:56,129
It alters the gene product and it's genotoxic.

260
00:34:56,130 --> 00:35:01,410
So it does kind of damage the the gene product itself.

261
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:14,240
On the other hand, if we have the same gene and we have changes in DNA methylation here, we would have decreased level of that gene.

262
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:21,320
The gene product is still there. It's not like it's it's bad, but we just have less of it than what we need.

263
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:26,720
Just because of those changes in the DNA methylation there,

264
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:33,620
that those changes are heritable like this, the daughter cells will kind of carry this same signature.

265
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:41,270
No changes in the gene product or the sequence itself doesn't kind of affect the gene

266
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:48,379
copy and it's potentially reversible like that same way that Mark kind of came through.

267
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:59,710
It can kind of go away. So any questions or thoughts?

268
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:10,710
Yeah. So is it heritable in like mitotic divisions within someone or is it heritable across generations?

269
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:22,409
Yeah, I think I mean, we're going to talk about it more, but there's some studies that have shown that it's kind of the past generations,

270
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:28,200
but it's still I feel like the consensus in the science is that it's not very well documented.

271
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:33,410
But what we mean by heritable is that when started by it, it's daughter.

272
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:39,510
Daughters will have the same epigenetic changes.

273
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:54,810
So people have looked at epigenetic changes like like once they looked at like looked at, it's very kind of sensitive to environment, as I said.

274
00:36:55,200 --> 00:37:01,770
So things like smoking are things that would really affect whether a gene is kind of turned on or off.

275
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:08,640
And people would look at like the DNA methylation specific gene.

276
00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:15,959
Sometimes that gene could be related to kind of breaking down toxins from smoking.

277
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:19,860
And they would see that it's methylated in a certain way.

278
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:27,360
But then they would look at people who quit smoking kind of for a long time, and they would see that.

279
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:35,790
I mean, if you kind of plant it, you would have never smokers, you would have former smokers, and then you would have current smokers.

280
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:41,850
So they kind of it kind of changes back, but it's different by different sides.

281
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:48,210
It can maybe return to normal like non smoker level, but sometimes it's kind of in between.

282
00:37:51,400 --> 00:38:00,310
So that that's kind of the part that makes studying that this epigenetic aspects of the genome kind of interesting.

283
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:05,380
Any questions? Okay.

284
00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:15,969
So so as we kind of touched upon the epigenetics kind of plays a big role in regulating gene

285
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:22,960
expression and creating those specialized cells that would only express a certain profile of genes.

286
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:27,370
It also plays a role in X and activation.

287
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:38,770
So we females have two copies of the X chromosome and it's actually we don't have both copies kind of actively transcribed when it's turned off.

288
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:46,629
And that's the turning off of the one X chromosome is done through with epigenetics genomic

289
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:52,270
imprinting we will talk about and then I think for you will kind of touch upon cancer.

290
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:56,520
We will talk about how as I was just kind of giving an example,

291
00:38:56,530 --> 00:39:05,530
how the epigenome is sensitive to the environment, so sensitive to things like smoking drugs.

292
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:18,920
Different things that can can also. We think that they affect the epigenome and so can also maybe play a role in adult onset diseases.

293
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:32,770
Oh. So genomic imprinting is kind of interesting because like so far in class,

294
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:38,620
we talked about maybe inheriting two damaged copies from mom and dad and that's

295
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:46,690
maybe one copy and kind of in a dominant situation that would cause a disease.

296
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:53,980
We never made a difference whether that copy is coming from mom or that copy is coming from dad.

297
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:58,900
So genomic imprinting is. Kind of the.

298
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:08,260
When we have we have a set of genes that we know.

299
00:40:11,290 --> 00:40:15,250
Like we should have, like we think about it, but it would explain it.

300
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:19,170
So the expression is very specific.

301
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:25,870
Like we would want a certain copy from mom being expressed and then not the copy from dad.

302
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:37,930
Like for certain genes which copy of the gene the body ends up expressing is very specific to the parent, to the origin of that gene.

303
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:52,410
So if we look at this example, if you have a mutation in the in the in a gene coming from the father,

304
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:59,710
you're still fine because you kind of have the maternally expressed gene.

305
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:04,230
So this is not in the case of not imprinted gene, then the body is fine.

306
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:13,920
But if you have a mutation in the father gene and then for some reason the maternal gene is kind of turned off,

307
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:18,390
or you have an epigenetic mark, you say this is like a tumor suppressor gene.

308
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:24,990
Then that's when you kind of end up with the cancer.

309
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:35,070
And it's not because you inherited the best copy, but because the copy you inherited that should be turned on from your mom is kind of turned off.

310
00:41:35,310 --> 00:41:38,460
So that's kind of genomic imprinting.

311
00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:45,710
It's that memory kind of that comes with the genes that are inherited that would.

312
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:51,050
Decide whether the gene is expressed or not.

313
00:41:55,370 --> 00:42:02,210
And this usually or this can affect multiple genes.

314
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:08,929
And it has been found to be associated with some disorders or syndromes like the Beckwith.

315
00:42:08,930 --> 00:42:20,300
WIDEMAN This is like an overgrowth where you have copies from chromosome 11, kind of not expressed as you expect them to.

316
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:26,120
And then this these two conditions are kind of opposite of each other,

317
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:42,620
where you have if you have the maternally expressed gene kind of lost on chromosome 15, you kind of have this this condition where like short stature,

318
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:52,009
thin individuals or and it's also affect like mental retardation versus if you have the same gene,

319
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:58,129
but you just lost your paternal copy of that gene, it's not being expressed.

320
00:42:58,130 --> 00:43:07,940
You kind of have the opposite effect where you have like an overgrowth and obesity just based on this genomic imprinting.

321
00:43:16,330 --> 00:43:32,130
Any questions on that? Oh, and this imprinting of of genes has been found to be associated with multiple conditions,

322
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:37,380
some of which we know which genes are affected, but for not for all.

323
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:52,049
So so in addition to like the role of the imprinting in the role of DNA, it's the epigenetics.

324
00:43:52,050 --> 00:43:54,480
And in imprinting, we,

325
00:43:55,740 --> 00:44:09,840
we also think that because the DNA of the epigenome is sensitive to the environment and it kind of it can probably be a way by which we can

326
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:27,840
have things that affect infants early on in utero exposures can also have a downstream effect on individuals after that initial period.

327
00:44:28,230 --> 00:44:34,559
So so I don't know if you've heard about the developmental origin of health and disease.

328
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:45,660
So this basically kind of it's a theory that you have this critical period in which the fetal is developing.

329
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:48,930
It's a very kind of sensitive period.

330
00:44:49,410 --> 00:44:58,160
And this is when the fetal tissues are kind of very sensitive to the maternal condition or the condition in utero.

331
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:05,669
And then the phenotype most appropriate for the environment is selected and expressed.

332
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:17,520
So. So during gestation, if there's if the mom is kind of malnourished or not getting enough nutrients,

333
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:27,299
then that would affect the uterus, the the the in-utero environment affect the fetus and result in a more thrifty phenotype.

334
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:40,410
So the baby would kind of be more likely to have smaller size, slower metabolic metabolism versus versus if it's the other way.

335
00:45:40,770 --> 00:45:50,670
And then as this person kind of grows into an adult, having that thrifty phenotype might not be advanced, it might not be advantageous.

336
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:57,870
So they might not have this kind of malnourished environment as they grow up.

337
00:45:57,870 --> 00:46:01,650
But just because of this early life exposure there,

338
00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:10,920
there's kind of cells or their their body is more tuned to surviving in a low nutrient environment.

339
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:18,420
And then they could end up having we think that as they grow up, they're more likely to have.

340
00:46:20,890 --> 00:46:24,100
Disorders related to obesity and Type two diabetes.

341
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:30,660
Does that make sense? That clear. Okay.

342
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:37,530
So so this this kind of thing can be related to the.

343
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:48,419
To make this kind of exposures and in early in the in utero can be mediated

344
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:57,720
by how the germ cells are formed and then how the zygote is finally formed.

345
00:46:58,050 --> 00:47:07,440
And it's it's kind of interesting to note that the methylation levels, as in those cells kind of get erased and added on.

346
00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:19,560
So as the parents are kind of producing those germ cells, we we see that there's kind of an erasure of the of the methylation.

347
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:25,290
So any methylation marks are kind of erased and then they are revisited again.

348
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:33,090
And then when the embryo is kind of after the zygote is formed,

349
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:40,500
there's also another another phase of erasing the DNA methylation and kind of adding new marks.

350
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:49,540
So that's like where the critical period kind of comes through because there's like a time point where the cells are kind of a blank slate,

351
00:47:49,570 --> 00:47:53,850
like there's no methylation marks. Of course, there's some that are kind of.

352
00:47:55,290 --> 00:48:03,149
Except like except for imprinting or cells that are genes that retain some memory of what what which ones should be trained on,

353
00:48:03,150 --> 00:48:04,410
which ones should be turned up.

354
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:13,170
But they're somewhat of a blank page that there's no methylation, and then those methylation marks are being added again.

355
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:25,800
And that's where the critical window of exposures can come through and do and decide of differences in DNA methylation residues.

356
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:42,870
So. So how does that kind of translate to an actual real life scenario?

357
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:48,410
So this this one study was done in western Maryland.

358
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:59,880
And and they were interested to see whether parental exposure to famine and prison can result in persistent changes to DNA methylation.

359
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:02,729
So that was back in World War two,

360
00:49:02,730 --> 00:49:16,020
where there was food embargo imposed by the Nazis and there were kind of set food rations that would kind of provide very little calories.

361
00:49:18,270 --> 00:49:24,239
And this is kind of well documented, like the amount of food rations and the period of exposure to famine.

362
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:32,520
So. So the researchers were interested to kind of go back and see whether exposure to to famine,

363
00:49:32,730 --> 00:49:37,110
to the for the uterus, for the for the fetuses who were in the uterus.

364
00:49:37,590 --> 00:49:44,760
So the embryos who are still developing, whether if they were exposed to famine when they were in their mom's uterus,

365
00:49:45,090 --> 00:49:48,780
whether that would kind of persist with them as they kind of grow up.

366
00:49:53,370 --> 00:50:00,960
So as I said, like there's like a critical window with which those works kind of can be left on the embryo.

367
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:09,000
So when they looked at early gestation, so they they going to compare siblings.

368
00:50:09,010 --> 00:50:16,079
So siblings who were in the uterus when there was this famine going on,

369
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:24,210
this embargo and food rations, and then the controls would be siblings or babies.

370
00:50:24,330 --> 00:50:33,300
Same mom who we're not exposed to, to that environmental stressor that we were looking at.

371
00:50:34,170 --> 00:50:41,399
And then they looked at DNA methylation at a specific gene, this IGF two, that's the insulin like growth factor.

372
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:48,030
And it's an important hormone secreted by the liver and regulates growth during gestation.

373
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:59,090
And they found out that differences in the IGF two methylation were still detectable and even six decades later.

374
00:50:59,110 --> 00:51:07,690
So this kind of site can still have can still be seen in adults 60 years later.

375
00:51:15,550 --> 00:51:20,530
And then when they looked at exposure and late gestation,

376
00:51:20,530 --> 00:51:28,480
so people who were exposed to famine late in gestation compared to same sex, siblings who were not exposed to famine.

377
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:36,190
And in those individuals, there was no difference observed in the and in the methylation for that specific gene.

378
00:51:40,390 --> 00:51:45,520
So kind of highlights back the point that exposure timing is key.

379
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:53,500
When did that explosion happened and that in your environment can lead to persistent changes in methylation

380
00:51:53,770 --> 00:52:04,510
and can maybe translate to effects on kind of adult onset diseases really kind of decades after.

381
00:52:10,930 --> 00:52:19,000
And so. Kind of building upon the same concept.

382
00:52:19,030 --> 00:52:26,530
Now, a lot of studies are interested in or in this like this there's this field of

383
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:32,850
interested in looking at the effect of the epigenome on adult onset diseases.

384
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:42,340
So social epigenomics really tries to understand how social, psychosocial and environmental factors.

385
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:46,240
So things like, I don't know, stress,

386
00:52:47,110 --> 00:52:59,310
even exposure to discrimination and living in a neighborhood that's kind of polluted or unsafe or so even like education,

387
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:02,140
like all those living in poverty.

388
00:53:02,770 --> 00:53:11,470
So all those kind of social and environmental, we all know that they are associated with the worse outcomes, like worse profile.

389
00:53:11,650 --> 00:53:16,870
We know that individuals who are exposed to these things have, I don't know,

390
00:53:16,870 --> 00:53:25,690
a higher onset of cardiovascular diseases are more likely to have diabetes or they they they tend to have worse kind of health profile.

391
00:53:26,260 --> 00:53:35,620
So social epigenomics really tries to kind of break down how those social factors kind of get absorbed into our bodies and

392
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:45,220
kind of translate into higher susceptibility susceptibility to two kind of conditions that we develop later on in life.

393
00:53:45,970 --> 00:53:53,200
And then the the theory is that living in a kind of a stressful environment would modify

394
00:53:53,200 --> 00:54:00,160
your epigenome just as you're trying to adapt and you're trying to respond to that,

395
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:09,910
to those stressors. And that kind of affects your gene expression and downstream lead to higher risk of some conditions.

396
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:10,360
So,

397
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:23,560
so this is kind of the conceptual model that we which were trying to understand how the environment can also play a role and some of the conditions,

398
00:54:24,330 --> 00:54:30,110
the complex conditions. Any questions on that?

399
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:38,479
Yeah. I guess like methylation is like increased methylation is usually seen as like bad.

400
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:44,959
But I know in like regions like the brain that like you need more like is that like the only is the brain

401
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:51,590
the only like anomaly kind of in that way we're like more methylation isn't necessarily a bad thing.

402
00:54:54,400 --> 00:55:00,120
I think it's really dependent on the tissue and the link where it's going to happen.

403
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:04,780
Like it has to be kind of very specific to this site.

404
00:55:05,710 --> 00:55:15,310
I think with age, we do kind of tend to lose the DNA methylation like we we would kind of start at a higher level of methylation across our cells.

405
00:55:15,310 --> 00:55:23,440
And then it kind of sags with time. But and it's kind of a random process, I think.

406
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:28,660
So some sites would kind of change really with age.

407
00:55:28,930 --> 00:55:35,020
Like people have looked at some sites and they would really kind of check with age and people have developed like that,

408
00:55:35,140 --> 00:55:43,510
genetic clocks, if you've heard about them. So they kind of really change with age and they can like, like how your body's aging.

409
00:55:45,070 --> 00:55:48,280
I don't know if you feel like it's different across different issues.

410
00:55:49,090 --> 00:55:56,920
Yeah. To be really to be able some, some studies would kind of look at global methylation or something.

411
00:55:57,010 --> 00:56:05,709
Some studies like at least what we look at, we would look at and specific sites and see how they differ with a certain outcome.

412
00:56:05,710 --> 00:56:11,600
So. Depends, I guess. The other questions that.

413
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:24,780
Okay. So this is kind of what I just said, how we kind of absorb potentially absorb social factors and try to adapt to our environment.

414
00:56:25,430 --> 00:56:38,410
And DNA methylation being this modifiable kind of layer of information can help us respond to those different stressors.

415
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:54,020
And this is just another example study that looked at also early life stressors and in mice.

416
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:59,100
So. So I think.

417
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:14,870
So they the experiment basically is that they had baby mice being separated from their moms for a set amount of hours per day,

418
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:19,730
and then the controls with the mice that they would just leave them with their mom.

419
00:57:20,990 --> 00:57:27,830
And then this kind of create as a stressor early on in life.

420
00:57:27,830 --> 00:57:41,209
And then the researchers were interested whether that kind of also translate to differences in gene expression or in the epigenome later on in life.

421
00:57:41,210 --> 00:57:50,240
And they knowing that stress can really act through this hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis.

422
00:57:50,240 --> 00:58:00,410
So, so usually the brain or the the hypothalamus releases the CRH and ATP proteins.

423
00:58:01,250 --> 00:58:13,080
So hormones that kind of act on the pituitary gland, which release adrenal critical tropic hormones that act on that dream gland at the end.

424
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:24,620
This produces cortisol. So cortisol is like that well known kind of hormone that is released by the body as a result of stress.

425
00:58:25,190 --> 00:58:32,839
So in this study, they were interested to interested to look at this AVP gene in mice,

426
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:41,690
to see how changes and how the like separating the baby mice from their moms affected the expression of this AVP gene.

427
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:54,840
Okay. So so as I said, the controls joined with their mom, the exposed mouse pups that were removed for 3 hours per day.

428
00:58:55,320 --> 00:59:01,410
They measured the cortisol corticosterone and then DNA methylation at this ABP

429
00:59:01,410 --> 00:59:08,010
gene and then the gene expression of this gene that plays a role in that HP axis.

430
00:59:09,660 --> 00:59:20,490
And so when they found in brief is that the sustained change, there were sustained changes in the amount of cortisol,

431
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:29,310
the gene expression of this AVP and then the DNA methylation in the controls compared to the exposed mice.

432
00:59:30,630 --> 00:59:37,770
So you can see here this is the causes of causes corticosterone and then you can see those in flux.

433
00:59:37,950 --> 00:59:47,849
Are those the pups that were separated and they had higher and higher, higher levels.

434
00:59:47,850 --> 00:59:52,230
That was significant and was sustained even one year after.

435
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:58,440
And then same for the gene expression, it was kind of always expressed.

436
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:05,250
And then the DNA methylation was also different between the cases and the controls.

437
01:00:08,260 --> 01:00:16,990
And then this is just looking at the exact the specific DNA methylation sites, like not looking at global methylation, but looking at specific sites.

438
01:00:17,470 --> 01:00:22,120
And then they're looking at six weeks, three weeks and one year and.

439
01:00:24,220 --> 01:00:32,920
Overall, they found that there were persistent changes in DNA methylation after this early, early life stress exposure.

440
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:39,700
Some CPG sites are affected, some or not, differences kind of decreased.

441
01:00:39,940 --> 01:00:45,130
So in one year, there's some that the stars signify significant differences.

442
01:00:45,550 --> 01:00:52,270
There's not as much significant differences. But but there were some that were that remained.

443
01:00:53,410 --> 01:01:00,030
Okay. So.

444
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:08,880
So kind of to wrap up like this whole field of epigenetic epidemiology tries to understand how to DNA,

445
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:17,879
how to use DNA methylation to understand how the environment can to understand like gene expression

446
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:26,130
related to conditions and understand how that environment can affect a risk for certain conditions.

447
01:01:27,810 --> 01:01:31,770
Challenges related to studying DNA. Now it is kind of stable.

448
01:01:31,770 --> 01:01:39,170
It is easy to measure quantitatively. As I said, you can look at site at a site and measure percent methylation there.

449
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:43,530
It's it's not the same for histone modifications,

450
01:01:43,530 --> 01:01:52,600
but at least for DNA methylation it is now challenges is are related to when are you going to measure DNA methylation.

451
01:01:52,620 --> 01:01:57,330
So as we said, like this kind of DNA methylation can change across age.

452
01:01:58,560 --> 01:02:03,570
So when are you measuring it? It's critical. Cell specificity.

453
01:02:03,570 --> 01:02:05,370
This is really important because.

454
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:16,160
If we were to study live humans like we probably can only have tissue from the blood maybe, but cool cells to look at.

455
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:26,240
Probably some, maybe some like muscle and other, but like as having access to brain tissue is not possible.

456
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:35,470
So you cannot really say per say that the epigenetic marks in the blood are the same as the epigenetic marks in the brain.

457
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:45,770
So it's all kind of an approximation. Or you would look at just tissue samples after the person's disease and then

458
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:52,010
things that also we kind of have to take into account is genetic variation,

459
01:02:52,250 --> 01:03:00,430
like having differences in genes can also affect is also another factor that plays a role in differences in.

460
01:03:02,180 --> 01:03:08,480
That we kind of have to consider. DNA methylation would change with age, so that's something to account for.

461
01:03:09,410 --> 01:03:14,460
And then you could have just natural epigenetic, stochastic cities.

462
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:22,070
So really differences that don't have a meaning or it's kind of hard to pinpoint their effect.

463
01:03:24,470 --> 01:03:31,010
So so the question for you on the type of family studies that you think are most

464
01:03:31,010 --> 01:03:35,419
useful and this kind of study where you kind of want to detect differences,

465
01:03:35,420 --> 01:03:39,320
but, you know, there's there could be differences for a million different reasons.

466
01:03:41,090 --> 01:03:49,190
He sobs. Where you have a natural control.

467
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:58,830
Yeah. So when you ask this, is it like within families or between families?

468
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:08,319
I mean, I guess. Don't forget about families like how would you if few China detect differences.

469
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:11,170
But you know, there's a big role for the environment.

470
01:04:11,210 --> 01:04:17,230
Like, how would you kind of tease out what is kind of a true difference, what is just the environment?

471
01:04:18,490 --> 01:04:23,980
One idea that I'm thinking of is like within a family member, if one who has a history of mental health,

472
01:04:24,430 --> 01:04:30,190
illness or something looking at differences within those families with the members of those families because of the signifier,

473
01:04:30,190 --> 01:04:34,540
mental exposures and probably would say dietary intake.

474
01:04:34,540 --> 01:04:41,830
So yeah, yeah, that's that's this close. So yes, so we do have, um, you're trying to kind of.

475
01:04:44,420 --> 01:04:52,220
Let's kind of rule out the environmental differences from just how they grew up and then see how that kind of plays a role.

476
01:04:52,460 --> 01:04:59,990
And then a step further would be actually looking at twins that were have the exact same genetic information.

477
01:04:59,990 --> 01:05:07,129
So we know that that's like not playing a role. And then they potentially were raised in the same environment,

478
01:05:07,130 --> 01:05:14,120
even the same in utero exposures, and then we can kind of look at how their epigenome changes.

479
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:21,499
So I know if you remember the the astronauts, Kelly, the twins one,

480
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:32,120
when I think they looked at their epigenome like and see like the the the one who stayed on earth versus the one who was out of space.

481
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:38,240
And they're on the mission. They they were able to kind of compare how the epigenome changes.

482
01:05:38,630 --> 01:05:42,950
So they it does make for kind of an interesting setting for studies.

483
01:05:45,740 --> 01:05:55,819
Where we could look at concordance and discordance to kind of help understand kind of breakdown whether that effect is genetic,

484
01:05:55,820 --> 01:06:01,790
whether it's an environment where there is just random differences.

485
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:13,810
So. So yeah, having having twin studies is really helpful.

486
01:06:13,810 --> 01:06:22,090
But also we cannot they could still be reasons why you would have differences and even between twins.

487
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:26,860
Like a somatic mutation that would have been one twin just.

488
01:06:30,700 --> 01:06:38,739
I don't know, differences in in utero exposures that would affect one twin and not the other or just random

489
01:06:38,740 --> 01:06:46,450
epigenetic programing or changes in environment or related to environment like one smokes,

490
01:06:46,450 --> 01:06:56,680
one doesn't. These are things that kind of can affect identical twins and results in different results and discordance.

491
01:06:58,730 --> 01:07:03,710
So I think this is kind of the last thing we will talk about.

492
01:07:04,700 --> 01:07:15,109
So this is an example where when epigenome were mapped, so those were identical twins, someone had psychotic twins.

493
01:07:15,110 --> 01:07:21,919
So they had the exact same genetic code somewhere from the same placental sac.

494
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:29,210
So they can develop mono or ionic or like they have two placental stocks.

495
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:36,220
And they looked at they collected information on their behavior, environment, nutrition,

496
01:07:36,260 --> 01:07:43,840
health, and they looked at DNA, methylation, white blood cells from different tissues.

497
01:07:43,850 --> 01:07:52,910
So they compared them from different tissues and they looked at them when they were younger and then they looked at them when they were older.

498
01:07:56,270 --> 01:08:03,230
So basically what they found was so.

499
01:08:05,660 --> 01:08:13,700
And three year old twins when they were really young. The DNA methylation was very similar in both in twins.

500
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:23,330
Across both twins. And then as they grew up, we started seeing those areas of red and green.

501
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:30,950
So those are hypo methylated. Less methylated regions are hyper methylated regions.

502
01:08:30,950 --> 01:08:36,349
So there were changes in the DNA methylation between twins as they collapsed.

503
01:08:36,350 --> 01:08:38,180
So they started off being the same.

504
01:08:38,660 --> 01:08:49,850
But then kind of as they grew older, the differences, the epigenetic, similar similarity between them decreased over the life course.

505
01:08:51,870 --> 01:09:00,000
So probably differences to two environmental exposures, differences just as a result of age.

506
01:09:05,630 --> 01:09:13,160
And then this is just looking at histone marks in addition to matters of DNA methylation.

507
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:21,740
So you can see that as the twins grew older, it was more pronounced differences between their epigenome.

508
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:29,810
They were the same across the different tissue types, and they resulted in differences in gene expression.

509
01:09:33,030 --> 01:09:39,780
Okay. And then just lastly, we kind of touched upon this.

510
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:46,530
There's the science for transgenerational inheritance. Still not really clear.

511
01:09:47,250 --> 01:09:57,150
There has been some studies like in Sweden that showed that parental overnutrition can results in shorter lifespan.

512
01:09:57,930 --> 01:10:06,000
That is up to like great grandchildren generations to couple of generations down.

513
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:12,210
Early smoking can lead to kind of effects on great grandchildren.

514
01:10:12,240 --> 01:10:13,920
That's another study from England.

515
01:10:15,210 --> 01:10:25,890
And then in animal studies, it has also been shown also a couple of generations down where you can have certain deficits affect fertility,

516
01:10:27,390 --> 01:10:37,660
but it's still not very like. And I think based upon and how much that is really, it's kind of hard to tease out the environment from.

517
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:42,460
Probably it is true. Just epigenetic inheritance.

518
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:52,420
Resources. If you're interested to know more about this and any questions.

519
01:10:58,310 --> 01:11:08,450
So just to confirm one more time genetic or genomic imprinting, that's so a child inherits one copy from the mother,

520
01:11:08,450 --> 01:11:15,469
one copy from the father, and then genomic imprinting is when they inherit the turned off version.

521
01:11:15,470 --> 01:11:29,720
Or it's more of like the there's some, there's some memory kind of retaining whether this copy came from mom or dad for it, for certain genes,

522
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:38,600
I think it's like a set of hundred genes where there's like an imprint that would kind of separate whether this is coming from mom or dad.

523
01:11:39,050 --> 01:11:42,080
And then the body would look like.

524
01:11:43,270 --> 01:11:51,940
For a proper kind of expression. We need certain copies, like maybe the maternal copy to be turned on, but not the paternal copy.

525
01:11:52,390 --> 01:11:59,110
So it's like this imprint where we think the body has a memory of what copy it should express or not.

526
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:12,110
This is kind of an example of this is kind of an example of like where you mean.

527
01:12:15,830 --> 01:12:18,190
It can be like you can. It can.

528
01:12:18,250 --> 01:12:25,090
I mean, depending on the condition, it could be like if it's recessive, you can have like in this case, you can have both copies being affected.

529
01:12:25,510 --> 01:12:29,800
But one, just because it's turned off, that is that is how it's affected.

530
01:12:30,970 --> 01:12:41,400
So genomic imprinting, it's the word itself refers to the fact that it's you can identify which copy comes from the mother and the father.

531
01:12:41,420 --> 01:12:50,230
Yes. And then there's the preferential expression. I guess that's like the preferential expression of which copy of the gene you want to kind of use.

532
01:12:50,890 --> 01:12:56,460
And sometimes that's good and sometimes yeah. I mean yeah it can result in different conditions.

533
01:12:56,470 --> 01:13:00,730
Yeah. Yeah. Depending on what is affected or what. This is just kind of an example.

534
01:13:00,730 --> 01:13:05,320
But the term itself is like that memory that you retain, like as the.

535
01:13:06,830 --> 01:13:11,090
As the embryos formed, even though you erased them methylation marks.

536
01:13:11,090 --> 01:13:17,840
But there's some memory that tell the body which genes to use from mom which used to swim.

537
01:13:18,980 --> 01:13:24,940
You. Other questions.

538
01:13:31,750 --> 01:13:35,500
Okay. Well, that should be it.
