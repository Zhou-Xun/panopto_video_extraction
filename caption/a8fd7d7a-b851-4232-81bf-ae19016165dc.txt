1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:06,600
OK, and then now WhatsApp and PowerPoint, where's that?

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:17,950
So let's click here. And today's apps use the scroll button, it should be underpinned.

3
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:31,220
One would hope so. Yeah, right. Perfect. And then we can open.

4
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:40,160
Just one. So let's say if you can.

5
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:54,290
And let's look in our downloads and. Double click should launch.

6
00:00:54,290 --> 00:01:01,770
OK. So we're going to.

7
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:14,070
I don't need that this do I know you can do the whole screen and then I will turn your back on.

8
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:18,420
And they don't need to see this show. There you go.

9
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:24,030
Rolling. You have a great evening with you. And they'll talk some notes down, OK into the microphone.

10
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:56,950
And I do worry about that. That's right. OK. Have a great. Your glasses fog up the thing where if you just put them, then they're better, yeah.

11
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:16,890
First. Are we allowed to raise the temperature a little bit, are you all comfortable, so comfortable in here?

12
00:02:16,890 --> 00:03:03,730
Not too cold, not too warm. OK. And.

13
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:15,220
OK, let's get going, I hope you all had a good weekend and that everything is going well and the cold weather doesn't stick around for too long.

14
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:21,190
So today we're going to talk about how we identify organisms in the clinical microbiology lab.

15
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:26,890
And if you've taken has anybody in here taken an introductory micro course with a lab, so you know,

16
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:31,930
you three got a blood on your plate and you look for colonies and you do a number of biochemical tests?

17
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:36,280
Well, fortunately, we have gone a long way from that.

18
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:42,430
OK? We're using a variety of different methods. And one of the things I'm going to talk about.

19
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:47,860
You can pull up. I didn't print the whole thing out because it's many, many, many 60 or so pages long.

20
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:55,690
As published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases, which is a journal of the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

21
00:03:55,690 --> 00:04:05,260
And we have every lab that I've ever talked to public health and Clinical Hospital based have people say,

22
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:11,560
No, you're doing it wrong, you're doing it wrong. No, these are guidelines endorsed by the Infectious Diseases Society and the American

23
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:16,960
Society for Microbiology and Public Health on how to identify organisms,

24
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:22,610
and it includes things don't identify every organism in a urine culture or in a restaurant.

25
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:28,870
Culture really has very specific guidelines. And obviously, if it was a blood culture, you're going to want to identify everything.

26
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:38,380
But there are very good guidelines and we're going to. I was in a group of people who wrote this article and we were all clean micro lab directors,

27
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:43,300
and we would sit down and argue online or in person about what was the best way to do things.

28
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:49,600
And we finally came up with it with what I think is a very, very good document and everybody quotes it.

29
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:55,930
So if you're going to pull one thing off the web, I would pull that and the reference is in that is on one of the slides.

30
00:04:55,930 --> 00:05:05,850
OK, so let's get going here. So there's a rationale for organism identification.

31
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:11,040
We want to identify significant organisms in the identification can be based on

32
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:16,950
common phenotypic and genotypic characteristics among members of the same genus.

33
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:24,030
Now it doesn't always work because we all know that by using molecular methods, we can get very, very specific.

34
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:32,490
So if we're used on this chair, if we're using phenotypic methods to identify something,

35
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:36,870
we can get some wrong identifications in this day and age because all the organisms

36
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:41,450
that have been separated out by molecular methods all now have different names.

37
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:55,040
OK, so. Ideas based on phenotypic and genotypic traits among members of the same genus, the identification is based upon the best fit.

38
00:05:55,040 --> 00:06:01,940
Things are not always perfect, as you know, based on a combination of a number of different test results.

39
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:09,920
For example, gram positive cacti that are positive for both catalase and coagulate are staph aureus.

40
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:20,510
Except Oops, we've had to take a few organisms out of the group called staph aureus because we have by molecular methods, rename them.

41
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:25,070
So if you do phenotypic, it will have the large group called staph aureus.

42
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:29,540
And if you do molecular or sequencing, you'll get a lot of different names.

43
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:34,040
But staph aureus is still very, very important and still in that group.

44
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:44,330
So identification phenotypically is based on growth factors or on different types of media or on antimicrobial resistance factors.

45
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:51,110
And that has entered into the identification process because we have so much resistance nowadays.

46
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:57,540
We have to separate organisms out on most resistance patterns also. Next slide.

47
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:04,110
So we're talking about microscopy. I assume you all have had know how to use a microscope.

48
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:12,690
But let's go over the terms. So magnification is the enhancement of size using ocular and objective lenses.

49
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:20,820
So there are two different lenses on the microscope. The ones that eyepiece are the Oculus and then the ones you can turn 10x 40 and so on.

50
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:27,660
Those are the objective lenses. The Oculus, generally, as I said before, magnify 10x.

51
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:34,800
The objectives, depending on which lens you use, could be four times the size 10 times 20 all the way up to 100 times.

52
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,750
When you get up to 100, that's oil immersion.

53
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:48,510
You have to put a drop of oil on the slide to to see the the really fine visualization visualization of the organism.

54
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:54,060
So by you doing magnification, we can see and describe bacteria, fungi and parasites.

55
00:07:54,060 --> 00:08:02,610
We still can't use this for viruses because they're just too small. We have to use them or a molecular method to to identify them.

56
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:11,100
So that's that's magnification. Then we have to talk about resolution. How do we separate out or distinguish between two different objects?

57
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:24,620
And so the resolving power of a microscope is the the closest distance between two objects, and that is enhanced when we add oil.

58
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:31,980
What using with one objective to prevent light scatter, we can really define what we're looking at.

59
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:43,140
Using that oil lens? OK. And then finally, contrast, if we didn't stain things, it would be very difficult to see them in a specimen or on a slide.

60
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:47,160
So we use stains to visualize what we're seeing.

61
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:53,430
And we also use those stains to make that big distinction as a gram positive or gram negative.

62
00:08:53,430 --> 00:09:04,140
OK. Next slide, so here's a schematic of a microscope, I don't know if you've ever looked at it in quite this degree,

63
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:09,060
but we have here on the right hand side, we have the oil immersion objective and you can see it.

64
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:16,260
It touches the oil that you're going to put on that side. That's how you get that great magnification and the specimens on the slide.

65
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:21,720
Then we have the stage, the condenser, which helps focus the light and the light source.

66
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:26,220
And then if you have if you look at this would be on the specimen, on the slide.

67
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:35,040
And here is the magnified image. You can actually see individual bacterial cells or individual white cells and individual epithelial cells.

68
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:40,060
So you really need that magnification to see and it goes back and forth through

69
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:46,620
a couple of different lenses and with the condenser lens on the bottom.

70
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:52,720
OK, so that's a microscope and of course, the person's eyes up here at the top.

71
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:59,230
Next slide. So how do we apply microscopy and diagnostic microbiology?

72
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:05,950
So when specimen comes into the laboratory, well, we won't do a gram stain on a urine specimen unless rarely requested,

73
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:10,150
but it's not routine, but a sputum specimen comes into the laboratory.

74
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:15,310
We're going to take that specimen. We're going to apply a thin smear of it to a slide.

75
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:23,350
Let it dry heat, fix it so it doesn't come off while we're staining it, stain it like that dry.

76
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:27,760
Put it on the microscope and start looking at it with a lower lens.

77
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:33,190
We don't put oil on immediately to see. We're looking to see if there are polymer for nuclear cells there.

78
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:40,880
And you can tell on high dry for there, you may be able to tell if they're they're on on medium power, but high dry and oil.

79
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:46,630
You'll see the more for new. And you can differentiate those from the epithelial cells by how they look.

80
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:52,990
OK. So we're going to look for that. We're going to look at organisms that might be present.

81
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:57,520
So on a sputum specimen, we're looking for staff for strep.

82
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:02,920
We're going to look for gram negative rods. We can't differentiate the gram negative rods based on a gram stain,

83
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:08,650
but we could say moderate gram negative rods present and they we all know they shouldn't be there.

84
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:10,030
We know what normal flora is.

85
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:17,800
We don't report normal for some alpha strep, which you can't tell if they're alpha, but their strength is they're smaller than their staff.

86
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:25,150
You should see some small gram positive rise like Karani bacteria and a few other organs like that, but not overwhelming numbers.

87
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:34,990
So if there's a staph infection or a strep infection, there will be overwhelming numbers of gram positive cocci in that in that gram stain.

88
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:42,430
So the bottom of this table nine point one give you information on different organisms, groups and where we can see them.

89
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:48,010
So you can see that we can only see detect viruses if we're doing fluorescence microscopy,

90
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:58,300
which we use a specific antibody to bind to the virus or the viral infected cell so that we can find it in electron microscopy,

91
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:05,410
which you don't have typically in the clinical microbiology lab. But for bacteria, fungi and parasites, we do brightfield microscopy.

92
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:11,140
We can do fluorescence microscopy and we can also do a dark field for some bacteria here.

93
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:14,650
We're really thinking Spier like trapping him, and that causes syphilis.

94
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:17,590
That's what we would do it for.

95
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:29,320
OK, so we're talking about microscopy, we have to talk about how do we visualize the organisms and whatever else is in the specimen on that slide?

96
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:37,360
And there we go, our staining techniques. So as I said before we apply the samples to the slide.

97
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,150
We may smear it out a little bit.

98
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:49,840
If it's a liquid like a spinal fluid, we should have centrifuged it so that we can get the sediment out from the bottom of this tube.

99
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:58,510
And we will put a drop of that with a sterile pipette so that we don't contaminated food culture and we look to see what's there.

100
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:05,180
So we're going to let the specimen dry on the slide. We're going to heat fix it and heat fixing.

101
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:10,900
Doesn't mean you burn the slide. You pass it through the heat gently.

102
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:16,450
Many labs have heating blocks. They can just put this light on and it will heat fix the slide.

103
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:20,410
And you can also fix it with methanol. And then we're going to do the Graham said.

104
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:27,070
You all are familiar with the Graham saying we had Crystal Violet, which is the primary stain we had Graham's iodine, which is important.

105
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:32,530
It helps fix the crystal violet in the gram positive cells.

106
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:41,920
Then we added a deep color riser, acetone ethanol, and then we add a kerosene, which generally saffron is used.

107
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:46,960
And so if the cells are the bacterial cells are red, we'll know that their gram negative,

108
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:57,530
if they're bluish purple, we know that they are brand positive. And then the white blood cells will show up also.

109
00:13:57,530 --> 00:14:04,580
So here's a schematic of a bacterial cell, and you can see on the left hand side,

110
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:12,950
we see this peptidoglycan layer in the green and we see very little peptidoglycan on the right hand side.

111
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:16,970
So the the left hand side is what we were the cell wall of a gram positive

112
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:22,130
organism and the right hand side is the cell wall of a gram negative organism.

113
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:27,950
And so on the gram negative organism, we have, as I said, very little peptidoglycan.

114
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:35,120
But we have the cosmic space, which you can see there, right here and here in the yellow.

115
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:42,950
And then we have the outer membrane and that outer membrane makes many gram negative cells much more difficult to stay.

116
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:49,310
So if they don't stain well, we might have to go back to another slide and leave a stain on longer.

117
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:55,550
Don't be colorized quite as much and really work with it to see it, but generally we don't have those problems.

118
00:14:55,550 --> 00:15:01,070
But the important thing here to remember is the peptidoglycan and the gram positive cell wall.

119
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:10,490
Very little peptidoglycan in the gram negative, but a lot of that how remembering that makes it much more difficult to stay in the cell.

120
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:11,150
Next slide.

121
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:20,510
So here's another schematic gram positive versus gram negative, and interestingly enough, most gram positives are most come with the cardboard.

122
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:27,560
So the round and gram negative are generally rods, so we stay in it after the primary stained with crystal violet.

123
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:32,420
Everything is that bluish purple color. Everything we can't tell anything except something's there.

124
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:35,870
Then we add iodine to keep the stain in.

125
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:41,620
If it's if it's a cell that what type of bacteria that will lose that stain?

126
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:45,920
We already colorized. And look, what happens to the gram negative?

127
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:52,430
They lose the stain. We then add powder stain, which is red saffron in the gram positive.

128
00:15:52,430 --> 00:16:02,680
Stay bluish purple. The round negatives because they lost that stain initially stained pinkish red, and we can tell that gram negative rods there.

129
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:09,420
Easy, which was always came out that easy, but that's the basis.

130
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:15,450
OK, so here we have just a reminder of the different shapes of organisms that we would see.

131
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:21,240
So Karzai can be in clusters or chains. They can be in pairs or tetrad.

132
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:28,950
OK. Generally, if there are clusters, we think about staphylococci, if they're in pairs or very short chains.

133
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:32,410
We think streptococci.

134
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:40,420
If they're bacilli, they can be very short pocketed bacilli like Haemophilus influenzae, it's a very, very short gram negative rod.

135
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:49,380
OK. We have miscellaneous shapes of other shapes of rods for gram negative, and then we have the fusiform bacteria.

136
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:54,270
And here we think Spire Keyser fusiform, OK? They don't stain very well at all.

137
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:59,370
You have to use a cellular stain to see them. And so this fire keeps it down here at the bottom.

138
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:04,260
In other fusiform bacterium, it would be Fusarium an animal. It's a thin rod.

139
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:06,530
May have pointy edges.

140
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:16,080
OK, now one attack is reading a slide, say, from a deep wound, and she would see something shoot, the tape would say in the report.

141
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:23,040
Gram negative rods present some fusiform with pointed ends, something to say that this is different.

142
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:31,450
It's not looking like an E. coli or pseudomonas. Next slide, so here's an exam type question.

143
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:35,270
The first step in the grand scheme is the application of the primary sensor,

144
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:42,550
which is the primary stage saffron crystal violet Graham's iodide or Bransby visor.

145
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:49,690
Anybody can answer. Be right, Crystal Violet.

146
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:59,310
Absolutely. So you need to know the order of of the stains for a gram stain.

147
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:04,110
And that clearly is used more often than any other state in constraining clinical microbiology,

148
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:11,100
except when we're looking for fungi, we just use potassium hydroxide to break everything down.

149
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:19,590
So here's an example of a smear from a patient, a marginal specimen from a patient who's got Neisseria gonorrhea.

150
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:32,970
And so you see very, very small gram negative cuts and no serious DNA like this don't just make to the two edges together, they look halfway.

151
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:39,090
And you see lots of color morphing, including leukocytes. So you can see the polyps.

152
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:44,490
You can see the result here. It looks like they're in their curve.

153
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:57,330
They've got different nuclei present just loads of polymorph from nuclear leukocytes when there's Neisseria gonorrhea.

154
00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:06,600
OK. This is a warm specimen with a gram stain. So you see the pile more of a nuclear leukocytes, see them.

155
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:11,430
You see some other white cells that don't look like they have all the nuclei split up.

156
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:18,330
And then you see these very, very small gram positive in pairs and clusters.

157
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:21,780
The wound, the first thing we're going to think about is staph aureus.

158
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:26,640
The technologist will not call it staph aureus on the ground stain because there are

159
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:32,840
other things that can look like that gram positive Karzai presence in clusters.

160
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:37,460
And then the person they go on and do the identification, have the ID out in a day or two.

161
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:42,650
So the person, if it's if it's an infectious diseases physician, they'll know what that means.

162
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:45,770
If it's an infection prevention us, they will know what that means.

163
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:53,000
But the rest of the people, the surgeons, nursing staff oftentimes do not know what that means.

164
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,310
OK. But we do rely upon the the physician and particularly the infectious diseases

165
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:05,770
physicians and the infection prevention of knowing what those terms mean.

166
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:13,270
OK, so we talked about days, there are some other staining techniques I want to talk about, particularly acid best things.

167
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:21,580
Now we use acid fasting primarily for mycobacteria, but quite a bacterium is closely related to mycobacteria.

168
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:25,700
They have the same amount of thickened cell walls.

169
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:33,580
OK, so acid states have the use of these bacteria are organisms with a high degree of fatty acids or my colleague acids,

170
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:37,630
my folic acid, their fatty acids, and they make the cells waxy.

171
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:47,410
Not that I've ever picked one up and rubbed it, but the waxy. And so this root makes the cell resistant to decolonization with acid alcohol.

172
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:54,580
And so they are acid fast. You can't be colorize them with your routine, the colonizer.

173
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:58,120
So this includes Mycobacterium species. No hardiest species.

174
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:01,750
Some cryptosporidium are acid fast,

175
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:10,930
but not as acid fast as mycobacteria and some coronae back to your are a little acid fast, but not as much as mycobacteria.

176
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:14,620
So the procedure here is you need fix the specimen on the slide.

177
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:19,410
Let it cool and your primary stay, which is the cardinal function.

178
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:22,420
And there are different staining techniques that zeal Nielsen technique,

179
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:28,750
where we add heat to the bottom of the slide and heat helps drive the stain into the cell or the kinion,

180
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:32,830
which has a higher concentration of phenol in the stain.

181
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:38,830
And that phenol helps the stain into the cell when the Kenyan does not require heat.

182
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:43,270
I don't think the Kenyan, after 37 years of looking at acid festive,

183
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:51,250
I don't think the Kenyan stays quite as intensely as the real meals and that there are times we do need to use the Kenyan.

184
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:59,470
So once it's left the carbo fix and on sufficiently long enough for your seeding technique,

185
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:07,390
you do colorize with acid alcohol, not just ethanol, but acid alcohol, and then you counter stained with methylene blue.

186
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:11,050
So if it's not acid fast, the cells will be blue.

187
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:15,070
You can use malachite green also, in which case the cells would be green.

188
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:19,150
If they are acid fast, they will stay red.

189
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:26,110
And if they're partially acid fast like no cardea and some of the of bacterium, you'll see kind of a blotchy look.

190
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:33,120
Some of them will be acid fast. Some of them won't. Some of them will be partially acid fast.

191
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:39,570
Next slide. So here's an example of an acid test in the organism is courting,

192
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:44,910
so you can see now it looks like they're all stuck together and that's how according.

193
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:58,580
And those are acid fast organisms. My thirty seven years, I think I only saw it like this two or three times.

194
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:02,780
OK, so here's a gram stain and an acid fast.

195
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:12,560
So the gram stains on the left. Yes, the first thing is on the right. And you can see that each thing gives you different types of information.

196
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:25,910
They both tell you the shape of the cell, which is very useful, but you can see that you can see that with the acid fast or the.

197
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:31,110
OK, so I said this Ron Brownstein for the right acid fair for M.S. On the left, the acid test is on the right.

198
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:37,280
Who could just do that? OK, so the acid test was positive, which means just a gram positive rod.

199
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:41,130
You can see that on the left hand side, but they're also acid bath.

200
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:49,190
Now, once again, Mycobacterium, whether it's tuberculosis or any of the typical mycobacteria is not going to stay very well the ground.

201
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:56,240
So this is going to go more into the realm of no party acting actual my seeds, et cetera.

202
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,810
Probably not quite about better because they don't stain hardly at all with acid.

203
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:06,810
That's most of them. Do that stained with acid test. Next slide.

204
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:12,870
So we also need to talk about fluorescent microscopy of any of you ever used a fluorescent scope?

205
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:19,830
Great. So you know something about it? OK, so we have to use specific dyes when we're using the fluorescent scope.

206
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:24,300
They include floral props, and these give off light when they're excited.

207
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:33,240
When they first they get off white and the color of the light depends on the dye that's used and the filters that are used on the microscope.

208
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:39,270
So if you're doing Michael Bacteriology or working in an AFB and fungal lab,

209
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:47,700
which they usually combine those, then you're going to have the right kind of dye to see those organisms.

210
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:56,610
If you were working in another type of lab or you were not specializing in mycobacteria or fungi, you will use a different skillset di.

211
00:24:56,610 --> 00:25:05,430
OK, so the dye they use has has to be able to pick up the organism that you're looking for or the group of organisms looking for.

212
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:12,360
So our staining technique is shown here. It's a up for me is a direct interaction of the stain with the organism.

213
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:20,490
So if it's happening on which we use commonly in the laboratory and stain nucleic acid and this is used for so-called deficient organisms,

214
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:29,490
what's a cell, well, deficient organism? Anybody give me a name? About mycoplasma, so all the fish.

215
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:34,740
OK, we can stain them with it, according to one thing, OK?

216
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:45,240
Or mean Rotimi is the fluorescent stain that we use for Mycobacterium and Kalpa floor white used to detect fungi,

217
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:50,910
and because fungi are so much larger than most bacteria, we don't have to use oil immersion lens.

218
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:55,760
For the most part, we can use a hydride, which helps us look at the slide.

219
00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:04,800
The more the side more rapidly, if it's immunofluorescence, the floor crawl from the stain is bound to an antibody.

220
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:15,580
And when the antibody binds with the the antigen in the cell that is specific for that will light up.

221
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:20,020
Next slide. So here's an example of an action in Orange State,

222
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:24,760
so you can see the white blood cells and what you're looking at in the new find the white blood cells

223
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:36,030
and then you can see the bacteria and how small they are in relation to the white blood cells.

224
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:41,550
And here's a Mycobacterium that we would see with a warming melamine stain.

225
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:50,700
And this is fabulous for screening sites because if you have to screen all your AFB slides with an acid fast then and do it on oil,

226
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:57,180
it takes you a lot longer when you can screen them with this and then confirm with

227
00:26:57,180 --> 00:27:25,330
a regular acid test that you've just saved your technologists a lot of time.

228
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:35,260
OK, so here we have another cat for White. And these are fungal cells, they are yeast and I don't know if you can.

229
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:40,630
It's really not very. And you can see the yeast cells.

230
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:46,060
And you can see the hyphae coming off of it. So by and large, we see this.

231
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:53,410
That's Candida albicans. There are a few other yeast that can do this, but the most common one is Candida albicans.

232
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:57,760
OK. And you can see that. I don't know if you can see that as a septum right there.

233
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:06,410
So if you've got two cells coming off of the yeast and there are some scepter here also.

234
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:14,840
OK, so then we also use, as I said, the floor white to visualize fungi and tissues and in specimens, and it works beautifully.

235
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:18,110
If you had to do a brand new one, see them hardly at all.

236
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:29,820
But this blocks out everything else that's there, and you see the hyphy fluorescent from the top floor white and of course, on the surface go.

237
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:36,680
And you can even see the scepter in the sky separating the cells.

238
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:44,180
OK, so we're going to talk a little bit about a virus influence influenza had to put it in here because we're in the influenza season.

239
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:54,620
So here, how do we see a virus there so small you cannot see them with a light microscope, but you can do fluorescent antibody stains.

240
00:28:54,620 --> 00:29:03,590
So there are fluorescent antibody stains for influenza A and influenza B, and sometimes we have them for specific influenza viruses.

241
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:13,430
And so when it lights up, the green cells are set are or are human cells that are infected with the virus.

242
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:18,110
So we're not actually seeing the virus, we're seeing a cell infected by the virus.

243
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:19,760
And so that's what we do and we do for us.

244
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:32,210
An antibody stands for viruses because remember viruses, the only way you can see them is on a on a on a scope that has much greater magnification.

245
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:38,390
OK, so we've devastating now we have to try and grow the organism.

246
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:45,170
And so there are some principles of cultivating the organism in the lab.

247
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:50,150
You have to know the nutritional consider the nutritional requirements of the organism.

248
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:58,700
So an organism is either non fastidious or fastidious. If it's non fastidious, it only has simple requirements for growth.

249
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:06,680
It doesn't necessarily need a chocolate plate. May grow just on another nutrient, on a plate and not a blood sugar plate.

250
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:13,400
If it only grows on a type of plate, it's more fastidious than bacteria that grow on blood plates.

251
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:19,550
OK, so we've got non fastidious, has simple requirements for growth and fastidious,

252
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:24,470
and have really complex or unusual or unique requirements for growth.

253
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:30,620
So one of these organisms that will we will talk about in this lecture series is

254
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:36,380
Haemophilus influenza major pathogen of little kids can cause ear infections,

255
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:43,620
can cause respiratory infections. Can cause sepsis. Can cause meningitis, which is a major pathogen.

256
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:50,660
Fortunately, we have a vaccine for it years ago, early in the thirty seven years.

257
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:57,290
Unfortunately, we used to get kids in all the time who were septet with Haemophilus influenza.

258
00:30:57,290 --> 00:31:02,300
The number of those cases have dropped dramatically, which is wonderful.

259
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:09,110
So, so we have nutritional requirements for serious and non fastidious bacteria.

260
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:23,650
And then we have to consider the phases of growth media so growth media can come solid or it can be liquid or solid would be a plate or auger slant.

261
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:27,470
Liquid would be a broth culture and so solid over.

262
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:28,580
When we're making the media,

263
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:37,610
we have to boil the media to dissolve the order and then it will solidify by the time it reaches down to about 50 degrees centigrade.

264
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:44,660
If it's a liquid or broth, we just sterilize the broth culture media by boiling water in the autoclave.

265
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:50,810
Let it cool it because we can dispense it while still hot.

266
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:55,910
We don't have to worry about dispensing it after it's cool all night, contaminated so we can dispense it.

267
00:31:55,910 --> 00:32:01,100
We can actually dispense it if we want to and then heat it up.

268
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:11,000
OK, so we have classifications and media, so enrichment nutritive or supportive, selective and differential.

269
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:17,800
So enrichment is used to enhance the growth of specific organisms.

270
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:24,100
OK, nutritive or supportive is supports the growth of most non fastidious organisms.

271
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:31,180
Blood sugar, it's nutritive, but most things will grow if it's selective.

272
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:35,440
It's like a mcconkey plant.

273
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,920
What about Gram? Negative organisms can grow on it. Most gram negatives?

274
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:43,390
Not all, but most. And you can tell if it's lactose free. Men are not matters for dinner.

275
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:51,730
OK. And then we have differential media that allow organisms to exhibit certain metabolic characteristics,

276
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:57,220
and this has been utilized to create specific differential media.

277
00:32:57,220 --> 00:33:05,880
So if you're looking for one organism, you can use that and if it's there, it'll grow.

278
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:15,430
They have more, more types of artificial media, we've got Braveheart and Fusion Sheep, Blood Sugar, Chocolate Auger and more coffee out there.

279
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:18,450
Now let's start at the bottom. What kind of yogurt grows?

280
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:24,810
Gram negative does not grow gram positive because of the crystal violent and bile salts that are in the media.

281
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:27,390
Those are toxic to gram positive bacteria.

282
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:34,170
So if you have a say in respiratory specimen or a urine sample, particularly urine specimen where we expect gram negative rods,

283
00:33:34,170 --> 00:33:40,740
but perhaps a few co-ordinator, the staff or something put it on McConkey, the gram positive do not grow.

284
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:48,690
OK. You go up then to Braveheart. Confusion at the top of the list is very rich in nutrients.

285
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:53,220
It is a supportive. It's used in broth cultures a lot.

286
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:59,640
It's used in blood culture systems. So blood culture systems, the bottles have been hot and fusion in them.

287
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:08,730
You add the patient's blood, you put it in the machine and the machine will tell you when there's growth and we'll talk about this also.

288
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:13,010
Sheep blood agar is the general routine media that we use in microbiology.

289
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:18,450
It contains five percent sheep blood and allows you to visualize hemolysis.

290
00:34:18,450 --> 00:34:26,550
So if you think about grouping strep is hemolytic. Some gram negative rods are hemolytic, some staph aureus or hemolytic.

291
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:32,700
But by and large, the most hemolytic um are the are the Group B Strep Small Colony,

292
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:38,780
Large diabetes analysis and the chocolate auger is similar to blood sugar,

293
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:45,770
except with properties the blood, which means we feed to them and that release the X, X and B factors which are human.

294
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:49,980
And so that because they've been released from the blood cells,

295
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:55,350
we can grow Neisseria and Haemophilus whereby they will not grow on sheep blood either unless their

296
00:34:55,350 --> 00:35:03,320
right next to a staph aureus because of staph aureus is breaking up through red blood cells also.

297
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:07,190
So here are some examples she brought over here.

298
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:13,520
We had an on a not related blood on the flight next to it on the right.

299
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:16,970
We have better humor. So so you can see the I see it even better here.

300
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:24,750
You can see hemolysis of the red blood cells around these colonies. Colonies are very small, but they're humanizing those red blood cells.

301
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:33,530
OK, if you go down here on the bottom left, you have alpha hemolysis that does not like the red blood cells.

302
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:37,520
You can still see you cannot see through the the outer plate,

303
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:44,440
but it's doing a partial here miles of doing alpha Hamas, as you can see, darkening around the colonies.

304
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:50,560
OK. And then gamma hemolysis means no hemolysis.

305
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:59,690
So on the bottom right, we've got colonies growing on the blood on your plate, and there's absolutely no hemolysis.

306
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:05,450
Okay, next slide, so this is chocolate auger. It does look like chocolate, I don't know anybody who's ever tried to taste it.

307
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:13,550
I would not do that to make chocolate after you boil the blood before you put it into the into, it releases everything.

308
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:18,140
And so here's an inoculating. You can see how nice Haemophilus influenzae will grow on it.

309
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:29,430
Not a simple ones that will not grow on cheap blood, either, unless it's next to an isolate, such as a staph aureus that is lacing the cells for it.

310
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:38,310
And then here we have more Maconochie saga. We have not collated on the left lactose negative, meaning the cells are growing on the plate,

311
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:43,920
but they're are not pig, so they're lactose negative and not fermenting lactose.

312
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:49,830
And when you look at gram negative rods, that's a major dividing line when you're looking at identification schemes.

313
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:56,160
Lactose free men are an online tool for that. OK? And then on the right, we have lactose positive.

314
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:01,920
And if it's a urine specimen, the first thing you say, if it's lactose positive, hey, I think this might be an E. coli.

315
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:06,090
It could be a crab, but it doesn't look like are generally bigger in their mucus.

316
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:14,850
This does not look like it. This looks like an E. coli. That flies, so we have also have artificial types of media.

317
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:21,240
We have hacked on and Terrigal, where I mentioned that all the while contains bile salts and dyes,

318
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:27,840
and that those are bronze and all blue and acid fish used to inhibit nonpathogenic gram negative rods.

319
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:35,330
So we would use hectoliter. We're looking at a stool culture. Stool specimens are full of gram negative rods.

320
00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:41,760
OK, we want the ones that are causing disease, so we use head to head to get rid of everything else.

321
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:50,790
The non pathogens will ferment the lactose, so they'll change to from change dyes from blue to orange, so the order will look different.

322
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:55,530
Salmonella and sugar will be clear. And there's also fear of familial citrate in there.

323
00:37:55,530 --> 00:38:02,940
And if you've got salmonella, some oftentimes salmonella plus H2S and the colonies will be black.

324
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:05,250
So that's an easy way to pick them out.

325
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:12,810
But if you're using Columbia personalities like acid or CNR, it's Columbia on a base which is also in blood plates.

326
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:17,880
It has sheep blood as in blood plates, but also has antibiotics, colistin and now looks like acid.

327
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:23,460
And this is selective for gram positive Cox II because the colistin in the now looks

328
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:29,250
like acid will kill ninety nine point nine nine nine percent of the gram negative rods.

329
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:36,510
So if this growth is a huge likelihood that it will be a gram positive organism and then of course,

330
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:39,150
they are more at least use their more normal doing cultures,

331
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:46,260
genital cultures for a Neisseria gonorrhea and Neisseria meningitidis, also for chocolate agar.

332
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:50,700
And it's got antibiotics that colistin that inhibits gram negative rods.

333
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:56,790
It's got vancomycin, inhibits gram positive coxsone and it's got neistat and then inhibits yeast.

334
00:38:56,790 --> 00:39:01,740
So if you're doing it on a vaginal or rectal urethral specimen,

335
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:06,930
you're not going to get much growth unless it's Neisseria gonorrhea or Neisseria meningitidis.

336
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:13,770
Excuse me. So how do we prepare artificial media? We mix up the media.

337
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:19,430
We, if we only have blood at the very end flood comes in sterile, but we have to.

338
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:28,020
Our playbook for sterilization is similar to pasteurization of steam at 121 degrees for 15 to 30 minutes.

339
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:32,160
After that, we can let it cool, and if we have to add blood, we add blood.

340
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:38,770
Then after it's cooled somewhat. So here is Hecht on interrogator,

341
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:46,750
I remember Iraq actors produce acid on hacked on in terror and they will be pinkish red orange, whatever color you call that.

342
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:52,240
And salmonella does not produce that acid. It produces hydrogen sulfide.

343
00:39:52,240 --> 00:40:01,810
So the colonies are that black blackish color. Now, not all salmonella do that, but the most important ones, including Salmonella.

344
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:07,900
Typhi will do that. OK.

345
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:16,900
Other environmental requirements for bacteria, we have to have oxygen and carbon dioxide, anaerobic if it's aerobic growth.

346
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:26,230
It grows in room air. If it's facultad of aerobic, it may be Arabic or it might be an anaerobic can also grow aerobically.

347
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:30,730
OK. That does happen. If it's micro air, fill it.

348
00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:34,900
It can't use the same amount of oxygen that some bacteria.

349
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:39,640
So we have to reduce the oxygen tension for it to get them to grow anaerobic.

350
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:41,860
You can't have any oxygen there.

351
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:50,020
There are strict controls there by some of the Miami Herald Tower, meaning they can live with a little bit of oxygen, but not too much.

352
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:56,290
And then capital fill means they have to have increased CO2.

353
00:40:56,290 --> 00:41:04,750
And then as far as temperatures, most of the past pathogens will grow thirty five to thirty seven years like.

354
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:12,190
And more generally like 30 degrees warmer, 35 37 really well, but generally 30 degrees centigrade.

355
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:18,850
Some organisms like the cold, those are not generally human pathogens, cause we don't exist at those temperatures.

356
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:27,560
And there are some that like higher higher temperatures and that can be used to help with the identification process.

357
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:31,670
So how do we grow them? Now I've given you all the bits and pieces.

358
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:36,680
How do we grow them so that we can identify them so to isolate bacteria from a specimen?

359
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:41,410
You can't just drop specimens to like you have to streak it out so that you get isolated colonies,

360
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:45,590
so you're not trying to identify two different organisms at the same time.

361
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:51,230
So you speak for isolation and then you also straight to quantitate how much of that bacteria is present.

362
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:59,270
So you streak it in four different quadrants on the plate and that what you do if it grows in all four plants, it's heavy growth.

363
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:05,290
If it only grows in the last quadrant, a few colonies, it's rare. OK.

364
00:42:05,290 --> 00:42:10,870
And the technologies will evaluate the colonial morphologies based on the the factors here.

365
00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:16,300
What type of media did they grow and if it's only going on chocolate fastidious,

366
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:23,720
if it grows on EMV or something for brand, never should be told one way to gram negative.

367
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:27,970
The iconic characters have already talked to you about them. The the the form.

368
00:42:27,970 --> 00:42:33,760
The shape of the colony are the four they can point colonies in the circular filamentous.

369
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:40,090
What is the organism look like? Is it colony flat or is it raised up with the affect on the plate?

370
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:47,050
And what are the county margins look like? Are they smooth or irregular? And generally for most bacteria that cause disease?

371
00:42:47,050 --> 00:42:50,740
We don't have to really go into colony characteristics very much,

372
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:56,110
except that we know that Haemophilus influenza will be pinpoint until it has a couple

373
00:42:56,110 --> 00:43:01,640
of days of growth and to do the gravity of the sterile and the the subcultural.

374
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:08,110
Remember, we have to use a sterile loop and only use isolated colonies.

375
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:16,000
Yes. So here's another exam type question in my office, and for him, office requires human and energy for growth.

376
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:29,930
Based on these nutritional requirements, Haemophilus may be described as fastidious, non fastidious, supportive or non supportive.

377
00:43:29,930 --> 00:43:37,360
Fastidious, yes, you said that. Yes. Fastidious organism.

378
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:45,090
They say who said that I don't know anybody's names, but yeah. OK, conventional methods for identification.

379
00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:52,320
So we identified generally using phenotypic criteria.

380
00:43:52,320 --> 00:44:02,490
However, with the advantages in genetic testing and genetic methodologies, we are now doing a lot of genetic identifications also.

381
00:44:02,490 --> 00:44:08,340
But let's go to phenotypic because this is the standard across most laboratories and

382
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:13,950
what which will probably run into as labs bring on the more specific molecular tests.

383
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:18,990
So using phenotypic criteria,

384
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:23,070
you look at the microscopic morphology and the staining characteristics of gram

385
00:44:23,070 --> 00:44:27,540
positive carcasses in pairs and sit in clusters in pairs that might be strep.

386
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:32,760
If it's in clusters, it might be a staff. You look at the colonial morphology.

387
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:41,610
What are the environmental requirements for growth? Well, well, growing blood agar doesn't need chocolate and enhanced CO2.

388
00:44:41,610 --> 00:44:44,790
So what are those requirements for growth?

389
00:44:44,790 --> 00:44:56,970
And we can also do so little screening for antimicrobial resistance, and some organisms will be specifically resistant to bassett tracing nova bison.

390
00:44:56,970 --> 00:45:04,060
And now we screened for vancomycin also because of the problem with Steff aureus.

391
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:12,490
That's right. So let's talk a little bit about more about nutritional requirements and metabolic capabilities.

392
00:45:12,490 --> 00:45:20,890
So there are single enzyme tests that we can do very easily drop a drop of the enzyme on a slide or on the plate,

393
00:45:20,890 --> 00:45:23,320
depending on what that will kill everything on the plate.

394
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:28,240
And you can put a little bit of the organism in it on the slide to see if it bubbles the bubbles.

395
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:37,210
It's positive. So if we're doing catalase, then will differentiate staff and strep and also listeria is positive by gram positive.

396
00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:46,390
That's positive for families and other CRE bacterium might be positive, but most of them are not.

397
00:45:46,390 --> 00:45:56,380
So it can license very simply take a clean glass to drop, smear a little bit of your organism on it and drop of hydrogen peroxide for bubbles.

398
00:45:56,380 --> 00:46:05,830
If a bubbles is positive, it's producing hydrogen peroxide. You can do an oxidase test in the tech starting from today seven cells,

399
00:46:05,830 --> 00:46:12,430
and that helps with nitrate metabolism organisms that are oxidase positive the big pathogens Pseudomonas,

400
00:46:12,430 --> 00:46:23,100
particularly Pseudomonas aeruginosa animals and the other if it's a gentle specimen or a urine specimen specimen, Neisseria or all oxidase positive.

401
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:32,160
OK. And I should say not just end of this month, but if you're thinking about meningitidis, blood or spinal fluid, also in Donald Tusk,

402
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:42,930
you're looking to finish the great tryptophan fan to of a gas at ammonia bill and then you detect the bill in your Hobbesian aldehyde indicator.

403
00:46:42,930 --> 00:46:52,510
It's a presumptive test for E. coli. It's as simple as dropping a drop of the reagent on the organism and see what color turns.

404
00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:58,690
Look like the reactions were a lot to talk about, but it's a very simple test of your faith.

405
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:01,870
Does it grow the organism, growing your yard?

406
00:47:01,870 --> 00:47:13,600
And if it utilizes urea, the page will change and there will be a code change from kind of an orange color to bright pink color.

407
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:21,010
And then finally, the way our test is hydrolysis, if you're a little Pierro Little Nell Alfo, nephew of mine,

408
00:47:21,010 --> 00:47:31,960
that's a mouthful of the organisms that we think about, that a positive characteristic for this positive test, our group strep and Enterococcus.

409
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:38,290
So you can do a PCR test on the throat culture. You've got a colony, looks Delphi Group A streptococci.

410
00:47:38,290 --> 00:47:43,850
Ah, it's positive being reported out. OK.

411
00:47:43,850 --> 00:47:54,980
Here's some examples, Hadley says, bubbling versus now bubbling oxidase dirt on a swamp purplish color versus the negative in the drop,

412
00:47:54,980 --> 00:48:00,230
the reagent on this on the plate, it turns kind of a pinkish red color.

413
00:48:00,230 --> 00:48:05,370
Your face is done in a in a tube. You may have to do about a two hour incubation here.

414
00:48:05,370 --> 00:48:09,350
Also negative is orange, positive is pink and the poor are.

415
00:48:09,350 --> 00:48:22,420
You can see positive is that pinkish red color. Easy spot tests that help identify bacteria feed it, typically without going into genetic traits.

416
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:30,190
MRSA is a lot cheaper than genetic testing, so you can also look at metabolic requirements and nutritional requirements so you

417
00:48:30,190 --> 00:48:37,360
can actually test for metabolic pathways by looking at oxidation and fermentation.

418
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:41,690
Oxidation of glucose requires oxygen. Fermentation does not.

419
00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:47,170
If you do fermentation, the will decrease, causing a yellow color.

420
00:48:47,170 --> 00:48:56,470
So amino acid degradation, if the amino acid there are degraded, you can detect amino acid barflies enzymes.

421
00:48:56,470 --> 00:49:06,900
So this is off median, as shown in this picture. Can anybody tell me which one is positive?

422
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:11,640
There's one that's really positive, that's all I have to say. The green one.

423
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:19,200
Yeah. And the colors in your test, as your lab is using may not always be the same ones that I'm showing here.

424
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:26,210
Different companies that produce the chemicals may use different indicators.

425
00:49:26,210 --> 00:49:31,850
So what are the principles of phenotypic based ideas schemes?

426
00:49:31,850 --> 00:49:36,950
So you have to select and inoculate your battery of biochemicals?

427
00:49:36,950 --> 00:49:44,960
And it used to be that every biochemical was in a separate tube. So it took a while to to inoculate all of them.

428
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:52,010
But if you do the test better, you can take the bacteria that identify.

429
00:49:52,010 --> 00:49:54,680
You can discuss and report the clinical significance.

430
00:49:54,680 --> 00:50:01,010
We don't report organisms that are not clinically significant because that leads to misuse of antimicrobial agents.

431
00:50:01,010 --> 00:50:04,820
And you have to consider the availability of reliable testing methods.

432
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:12,770
You can incubate to see if a substrate or a particular type of media supports growth.

433
00:50:12,770 --> 00:50:21,710
So if you're doing conventional identification, expression of enzymes takes longer time than doing a rapid test.

434
00:50:21,710 --> 00:50:26,720
If you're doing a rapid idea, you're going to look for a detection of preformed enzymes.

435
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:30,260
And if they're there, they make a color change or that the media will bubble.

436
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:40,720
Something will change and you'll see that that is positive. So here we have principles of phenotypic based I.D. schemes.

437
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:50,410
We want to detect metabolic activity because of it's not metabolically active, it's probably either dead or in a very small group of organisms.

438
00:50:50,410 --> 00:50:58,270
So we can use colorimetric. So the indicators and certain types of media will tell us if it's acid or bass we can use.

439
00:50:58,270 --> 00:51:08,320
Fluorescence presence is one of my favorites. And so we use it to detect mycobacteria in sputum specimens.

440
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:15,130
And if you stay with your fluorescent state mycobacteria, particularly Mycobacterium tuberculosis,

441
00:51:15,130 --> 00:51:22,960
is present, it will release a floor for them and you'll get fluorescence if you're doing it on media.

442
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:27,940
Change may cause release of the fluorescence changes in the fluorescence.

443
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:34,660
We can look just for growth, turbidity or no, no turbidity, particularly in the presence of antibiotics versus no antibiotics.

444
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:44,700
If there is no turbidity and there's antibiotics, you make pretty good guesses it's resistant to that organism.

445
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:49,020
I said it wrong. There's no turbidity. It is, it is.

446
00:51:49,020 --> 00:51:56,070
Yeah, there's resistance after I said, right, okay. So we can also analyze the metabolic proof profiles and we use it databases.

447
00:51:56,070 --> 00:52:05,370
So if you've ever used an API strip to identify bacteria in a class that's got a metabolic profile, patterns already built into it.

448
00:52:05,370 --> 00:52:13,180
All the big equipment that identifies bacteria and now used have metabolic profiles.

449
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:25,710
It's all computerized. It's amazing. So here are API strips, and they make API strips for gram negative rods such as interactive.

450
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:30,160
They make them for non fermenters, different API strip for non-criminal,

451
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:36,990
such as soon as they make API strips program positive peroxide to make API strips for Gram Positive Rod,

452
00:52:36,990 --> 00:52:41,550
so you have to have a pretty good handle on what you think it is before you set up your API

453
00:52:41,550 --> 00:52:46,230
strip and you can see there's a number of different biochemicals in it you just inoculate.

454
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:48,000
Let me see if I can show you.

455
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:54,390
You can see that at the top of the well, there's a little opening for each one and you just drop a drop of your organism in each.

456
00:52:54,390 --> 00:52:58,590
Well, you put it in a plastic.

457
00:52:58,590 --> 00:53:06,540
This this sheet of biochemicals fits in a plastic carrier that you put a little bit of moisture in the bottom of it.

458
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:11,250
Put a top on it, put it in the incubator. So you put the moisture in there so everything doesn't dry out.

459
00:53:11,250 --> 00:53:15,030
Look at it the next day. Kind of cosmic, cosmic, cosmic.

460
00:53:15,030 --> 00:53:25,660
And then you go to the database and you put in those that look positive and positive numbers and you get your identification.

461
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:33,880
So here's an example of excellent identification of Vibrio vulnificus on the top,

462
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:43,160
and it's in several different languages, so you can do it in any language that you would like.

463
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:45,920
So commercial I.D. systems are great.

464
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:54,920
If you had to set up all those biochemical tubes by yourself and make all the media the personnel required to do that, it's overwhelming.

465
00:53:54,920 --> 00:54:01,220
You can't do it in a lab, in a commercial laboratory. So there's a number of different systems out there.

466
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:07,010
These are just some of them. I am personally a favorite of some of them, but I'm not going to tell you which ones.

467
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:12,520
But Trick makes a system microscope and makes the system better a difference that makes the Phenix system and Bill Murray,

468
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:13,610
who makes the biotech system.

469
00:54:13,610 --> 00:54:19,280
So there's a number of very good systems out there, and it depends on how much room you have in your lab, how many tests you have,

470
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:25,970
what kind of work you're doing, what kind of organisms you see, how much money you spend on the identification system and so on.

471
00:54:25,970 --> 00:54:31,720
And is it automated? So this is an example of the Vitek two.

472
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:39,670
You can see how small the cards are, all the identification is done on one card with the ability to inoculate it,

473
00:54:39,670 --> 00:54:42,460
put it in the machine and in a few hours you put your ID in.

474
00:54:42,460 --> 00:54:52,040
The machine is hooked up to the computer system so you can go directly across to the patient's chart if it's well, validated.

475
00:54:52,040 --> 00:55:03,290
So this is micro-SIM and micro-SIM cards come either for biochemical ID and a brief susceptibility, or you can get the same cards.

476
00:55:03,290 --> 00:55:09,500
The 96 well plates for all four susceptibility testing, depending on what you're doing.

477
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:14,720
And so this one clearly has biochemical identification on the top.

478
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:22,370
This is a negative urine combo, one panel, so it's got biochemical identification for a gram negative on the top and antimicrobials on the bottom.

479
00:55:22,370 --> 00:55:29,330
So the by the time it reports out an 18 to 20 hours, something like that, you've got everything done.

480
00:55:29,330 --> 00:55:37,280
And here on the bottom, it shows you the equipment now with automation and many, many labs are going automated like chemistry labs are.

481
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:40,670
These are all having micro-scale has their own automated.

482
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:46,670
A series of high tech has their own automated system where you put the specimen in at one end and it takes up all the space in your laboratory.

483
00:55:46,670 --> 00:55:53,900
Automation does, but the specimen in one hand, after you've validated everything, it'll come out in the other one with an ID and the susceptibility.

484
00:55:53,900 --> 00:56:02,180
But there's a lot of work that goes into setting those systems up and making sure that they're working properly.

485
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:10,040
So my favorite maldi-tof matrix assisted laser to such an ionization time of flight mass spec.

486
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:23,180
I love it. So normally it takes 18 to 24 hours to identify an organism like this can identify an organism in 30 to 60 seconds.

487
00:56:23,180 --> 00:56:30,740
And so what it has is has reusable stainless steel plates with circles etched on them.

488
00:56:30,740 --> 00:56:36,560
And you say Mrs. Smith's culture isolate is going in circles and wanted to smear some

489
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:41,930
of the isolate in there and you put the next person in as well as three or four.

490
00:56:41,930 --> 00:56:49,280
You also duplicate you and the plates are stainless steel so they can be washed and reused.

491
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:54,380
So there's no waste there. You got a matrix and let it dry.

492
00:56:54,380 --> 00:57:03,630
Put it in the machine and it goes in the machine right here and there's a laser at the top.

493
00:57:03,630 --> 00:57:08,010
Then goes down and it shoots that first, well, the first circle.

494
00:57:08,010 --> 00:57:14,820
And what the machine is doing is measuring the irons as they go up to the detector.

495
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:19,710
OK. So here it is.

496
00:57:19,710 --> 00:57:23,880
So here's the plate. The laser zaps one of those circles.

497
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:26,820
You've got the organism and it has to organism.

498
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:37,170
It goes up the flight tube and at the top we've got a detector that's detecting how fast and the size of the audience.

499
00:57:37,170 --> 00:57:41,280
This is amazing, just amazing.

500
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:49,020
And so this is the entire process from picking a colony on the plate, putting it on the on the stainless steel plate, putting in the machine.

501
00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:59,430
After you add the chemicals, you get your pattern or a different pattern and you report it, it tells you what it is.

502
00:57:59,430 --> 00:58:05,330
This just came out, probably within the last 10 years.

503
00:58:05,330 --> 00:58:12,020
And so instead of waiting overnight a second day, you've got growth.

504
00:58:12,020 --> 00:58:16,890
And then the second is overnight is for identification.

505
00:58:16,890 --> 00:58:24,150
You can do this the same day you have the grill and get your ordinance and ID out that same day.

506
00:58:24,150 --> 00:58:31,080
Now there are ways to do susceptibility testing out here also, but they have not been automated enough,

507
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:41,550
so the susceptibility testing was still moved by your routine method, probably a broth micro dilution.

508
00:58:41,550 --> 00:58:50,260
So before I go on to the next thing, I will say that there are techniques out here to do maldi-tof on spinal fluid.

509
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:58,060
So if you spin down the spinal fluid, put it on a drop of that on the plate and the chemicals, let it dry.

510
00:58:58,060 --> 00:59:06,640
Put it in the machine and know within half an hour, 45 minutes what it is to imagine how that would change.

511
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:10,990
How how patients with potential meningitis would be treated.

512
00:59:10,990 --> 00:59:18,550
It's unbelievable. None of this is easy. It all takes a lot of body control while work to set it up.

513
00:59:18,550 --> 00:59:24,010
But the change that MALDI-TOF has made for the clinical laboratories is unbelievable.

514
00:59:24,010 --> 00:59:28,330
And now, with laboratory automation, it can all be automated.

515
00:59:28,330 --> 00:59:36,970
Chemistry and hematology labs, Ted Automation, it's only within the last several years that microbiology labs have had automation.

516
00:59:36,970 --> 00:59:44,020
So now let's talk about immunochemical methods of identification. So here we're going to talk about how do we do what we do?

517
00:59:44,020 --> 00:59:54,220
We can do particle automation or latex cultivation to see if a specific antibody will cause clumping when it's put into a mix with a specimen.

518
00:59:54,220 --> 01:00:01,180
We can do immunofluorescence assays looking for specific organisms, either by direct immunofluorescence assay and indirect,

519
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:09,160
or we're looking for antibodies or an enzyme immunoassay and we can do solid phase immunoassays, which are membrane bound for the most part.

520
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:19,450
But they might be immuno chromatographic. So here's latex ablation through our organism in a drop on the fly.

521
01:00:19,450 --> 01:00:24,370
We mix in the specific reagent for the glutamate, its positive boom.

522
01:00:24,370 --> 01:00:38,610
You're done unless you have the culprit for susceptibility. This is a lateral flow, and it's a little bit different, it's like, I don't know.

523
01:00:38,610 --> 01:00:40,770
They got a test.

524
01:00:40,770 --> 01:00:50,070
How about that is like a COVID test is it reads off as a strong, positive, positive or negative, depending on where the lines form on the card.

525
01:00:50,070 --> 01:00:59,980
There is a little bit of you could do drug specimens, but you might want to concentrate them on that before you do it.

526
01:00:59,980 --> 01:01:07,840
And there are serologic methods for diagnosis also. So we have to talk a little bit about the features of the immune response.

527
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:20,540
So we have to talk about antibodies and so antibodies are very helpful when they're used in diagnostic testing, so it can tell you an acute response.

528
01:01:20,540 --> 01:01:27,530
Meaning acute infection or someone's reacting to something that they were immunized for or had previously.

529
01:01:27,530 --> 01:01:32,570
So you have to separate the acute versus the Investec response.

530
01:01:32,570 --> 01:01:40,580
Is it an extreme response? Mean acute infection or an ECG, something that they've seen before or been vaccinated for it?

531
01:01:40,580 --> 01:01:46,950
And remember, IDM cannot cross the placenta, but IGT can because it's smaller.

532
01:01:46,950 --> 01:01:50,940
And then once again, when thinking about serologic diagnosis,

533
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:59,660
is the patient immuno competent versus immunocompromised, you have a lot more problems testing.

534
01:01:59,660 --> 01:02:03,950
Serologic methods on patients, specimens who are immunocompromised,

535
01:02:03,950 --> 01:02:09,170
because because of that immunocompromised status, they may not have the antibodies.

536
01:02:09,170 --> 01:02:20,450
So when we interpret serologic tests, we compare, we're using a single serum versus a paired with the serum,

537
01:02:20,450 --> 01:02:27,500
such as an acute and then one taken a week or two later.

538
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:31,880
And are we looking for a rare pathogen or something? That's very common.

539
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:38,810
Certainly, it's much more, much easier to look for something that's very common. Rare pathogens we may not have the reagents for,

540
01:02:38,810 --> 01:02:43,010
but we want to look for generally when we're doing serologic testing a four

541
01:02:43,010 --> 01:02:48,650
fold rise in titer from the baseline doesn't increase at least four dilutions,

542
01:02:48,650 --> 01:02:53,540
OK versus qualitative, where it's just present.

543
01:02:53,540 --> 01:03:01,460
OK. And then you have to worry about cross-reactivity. So herpes viruses cross-react a lot.

544
01:03:01,460 --> 01:03:09,320
There are hydrofoil antibodies that cause cross-reactivity. And then if a woman is pregnant, they oftentimes get a lot of cross-reactivity also.

545
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:18,700
So sometimes you have to be very careful when you order a serologic test to consider what the patient has or what the patient has gone through.

546
01:03:18,700 --> 01:03:25,130
So here are some principles of serologic tests. There are methods for detection of antibodies.

547
01:03:25,130 --> 01:03:33,070
Now, as you all know, probably recognize antibody doesn't show up like that unless the person's been immunized and then the antibody shows up.

548
01:03:33,070 --> 01:03:36,250
Antibody response goes up much more rapidly.

549
01:03:36,250 --> 01:03:43,510
So there are particle blue nation tests whereby you have latex beads or red blood cells could within an antigen.

550
01:03:43,510 --> 01:03:52,620
You mix that with a drop of the patient serum. If it plots up or beads up, it's a positive result.

551
01:03:52,620 --> 01:04:01,110
There are formulation tests and this is primarily used with syphilis testing the RPI test, which stands for rapid plasma reagents.

552
01:04:01,110 --> 01:04:05,640
And so it's a precipitation of soluble antigen. But the antibodies,

553
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:13,560
so there are particles coated with the party of life and lecithin binds light

554
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:22,240
and lecithin and that binds with Reagan and if it binds with a positive test.

555
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:26,680
They never use for testing for syphilis, they never use the RPI alone.

556
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:30,520
It also always has to be followed up with a secondary test.

557
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:35,460
So our PR, unless it's negative, it's positive you got to go out and do the secondary test.

558
01:04:35,460 --> 01:04:45,360
There are lies there's a lot of allies is out there. They've done probably not done quite as much as it used to be enzyme linked immunosorbent assay,

559
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:49,050
but you can do multiple specimens at one time on a card.

560
01:04:49,050 --> 01:04:55,380
And then there's indirect immunofluorescence assays in this healthy organism or the antigen and flies.

561
01:04:55,380 --> 01:05:03,960
You have the patient's antibody or serum and you detect it with a secondary DNA, a fluorescent at first and tagged antibody.

562
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:09,450
Takes a while to do this, but for some tests, for some diseases, it works very well.

563
01:05:09,450 --> 01:05:19,540
And then, of course, there's the western blots, which are the most complex form of serologic test, but they do resolve a lot of issues.

564
01:05:19,540 --> 01:05:27,520
So here's an a test on the left, and I cannot tell you what's in these, but the ones that are colored are positive.

565
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:33,770
OK? And here's a western blot and it shows the various proteins.

566
01:05:33,770 --> 01:05:40,190
Here and so you would match him up to patient samples, so this would be the control.

567
01:05:40,190 --> 01:05:49,490
These are the patient samples and you can see this. This is probably a control, I would imagine, but this patient has a lot of whatever these are.

568
01:05:49,490 --> 01:05:54,530
And this patient only has one and you can barely see one here and maybe one there.

569
01:05:54,530 --> 01:06:04,150
So western blots, unless you're looking for syphilis and really kind of falling out of favor because they're hard to interpret.

570
01:06:04,150 --> 01:06:10,390
OK, now we are two of my 10 points of importance, and I'm not the only person who wrote this.

571
01:06:10,390 --> 01:06:15,880
This is from the article. I would suggest you all get the article.

572
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:21,070
Keep on your computer when somebody tells you to do something. No, it says not to do it.

573
01:06:21,070 --> 01:06:25,530
OK, 10 points of importance.

574
01:06:25,530 --> 01:06:33,460
And this is the group of us who wrote this, and we're from all 20 celebrities from everywhere across the country, including male.

575
01:06:33,460 --> 01:06:38,440
I mean, we all got together. We have big working groups on how to write this.

576
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:48,180
And it's we've done it did an update in 2018. It was really written in like 2013, supported by IDSA and the American Society for Microbiology.

577
01:06:48,180 --> 01:06:55,260
So, number one, most important specimens of poor quality must be rejected.

578
01:06:55,260 --> 01:07:02,760
Don't ever if you're working in a lab. Don't ever be afraid to reject a specimen because it's of poor quality.

579
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:07,350
On the other hand, if you're an infection prevention list, don't ever get upset.

580
01:07:07,350 --> 01:07:15,150
When somebody says we can't do the testing, the specimen is not correct. The lab wants to turn out their best results that you can trust.

581
01:07:15,150 --> 01:07:19,920
And if the specimen is not correct, they can't do it, they don't feel confident doing that.

582
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:27,600
OK? Number two, physicians should not be mad that the laboratory report everything that grows.

583
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:33,870
This can provide irrelevant information that could result in inaccurate diagnoses and inappropriate therapy.

584
01:07:33,870 --> 01:07:36,720
It will provide cause inappropriate therapy.

585
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:45,690
So if it's a wound infection that major not staph aureus and then a bunch of little tiny bacteria and a bunch of other things,

586
01:07:45,690 --> 01:07:53,700
clearly it was not a clean wound or a single, or he was opened to the outside, so it got contaminated.

587
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:59,220
If there's what I've always told people and I don't know how many are going into infection prevention,

588
01:07:59,220 --> 01:08:02,880
a lot of you, if you can get somebody on the phone and say,

589
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:10,650
Hey, this is what we're seeing and I don't think these other ones in generally this call goes to the physician taking care of the patient.

590
01:08:10,650 --> 01:08:19,260
I don't think what we're seeing are causing the patient's infection because there's a lot of what across said clusters there,

591
01:08:19,260 --> 01:08:24,300
but there's a lot of room for a positive result. I think those are contaminants.

592
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:32,880
And generally, what the infectious diseases specialist will say, just say that I should say, guys, it's in case we need to go back to it, right?

593
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:38,220
Though I can do that, I'll save it for a week. And if they don't need in a week or so, I'll get rid of it, OK?

594
01:08:38,220 --> 01:08:45,000
But to require do testing on an idea and susceptibility so that the patient most likely will get antibiotics they don't need,

595
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:55,350
you know, we try and make sure that we always work in the micro USB port very closely with our infectious diseases physicians,

596
01:08:55,350 --> 01:08:58,620
the infection prevention list and so on to make sure that they get everybody gets

597
01:08:58,620 --> 01:09:03,550
the information that they need and this is a question will be a discussion about.

598
01:09:03,550 --> 01:09:11,630
You know, this is what I'm seeing, you know, because the Turks don't have time and are not supposed to read the charts.

599
01:09:11,630 --> 01:09:15,590
OK, but then call the physician the infection prevention or do you need this,

600
01:09:15,590 --> 01:09:20,030
this is what we're seeing and most kind of we know, but some of you know things are going for, right?

601
01:09:20,030 --> 01:09:29,300
Can you report that? Sure. I'm glad to have the conversation be very open about it and have that conversation.

602
01:09:29,300 --> 01:09:34,610
OK, background noise of commensal organisms must be avoided were positive.

603
01:09:34,610 --> 01:09:41,780
So we know when you get a sputum, there's going to be a lot of organisms in there because everything from the throat mouth is going to be in there.

604
01:09:41,780 --> 01:09:48,710
OK? You try not to report those many by side, such as sputum, nasal sinuses, superficial wounds.

605
01:09:48,710 --> 01:09:57,830
General fat cultures have normal commensal microbiota that can easily contaminate an inappropriately collected specimen.

606
01:09:57,830 --> 01:10:02,990
Even inappropriately collected specimens are going to be there and complicate interpretation.

607
01:10:02,990 --> 01:10:08,240
So once again, those discussions with the health care team can be very, very useful.

608
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:12,540
It gets to be somewhat more difficult when it's a physician office sending things

609
01:10:12,540 --> 01:10:19,220
that OK because you oftentimes don't have that discussion with infection prevention,

610
01:10:19,220 --> 01:10:26,050
ID and so on. OK, so this is very important.

611
01:10:26,050 --> 01:10:30,930
The laboratory requires a specimen, not a swab of the stuff.

612
01:10:30,930 --> 01:10:38,310
OK, swabs are easy to use, but they oftentimes do not provide the laboratory with the best specimen.

613
01:10:38,310 --> 01:10:41,940
There are times that they do pretty good if it's a wound specimen,

614
01:10:41,940 --> 01:10:50,020
but a swab of a specimen oftentimes does not give enough specimen for the laboratory to do what they need to do.

615
01:10:50,020 --> 01:10:58,360
The laboratory must and I should put this in all caps, follow its procedure manual or face legal challenges.

616
01:10:58,360 --> 01:11:03,430
Nobody wants the lab to get sued and you'll lose your job if you do.

617
01:11:03,430 --> 01:11:09,610
Procedures are based on published evidence and if not foul, play everyone, including the patient,

618
01:11:09,610 --> 01:11:15,640
the physician, the laboratory and the entire laboratory organization or hospital.

619
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:24,480
That legal risk you have to follow the procedures and the procedures are written based on national standards.

620
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:31,070
Next one. Specimens should be collected prior to administration of antibiotics.

621
01:11:31,070 --> 01:11:42,440
We know this doesn't always happen, but if possible, get the specimen before the antibiotics have destroyed the normal flora.

622
01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:52,760
Number seven, susceptibility testing should only be done on clinically significant isolates, not on all microorganisms reported in culture.

623
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:58,880
Now, if the patient is highly immunocompromised, things are different.

624
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:01,610
But for your general run of the mill patient,

625
01:12:01,610 --> 01:12:10,710
you report what you're supposed to be reporting as it is written in the procedure the physician can or the nurse practitioner.

626
01:12:10,710 --> 01:12:17,390
I keep saying this could be the nurse practitioner play someone who can't say, Hey, is there anything else this patient has blah blah blah?

627
01:12:17,390 --> 01:12:19,820
Then you can have that conversation with.

628
01:12:19,820 --> 01:12:28,430
And if you're not comfortable doing that as the technologist in the lab or someone else, you're a laboratory director,

629
01:12:28,430 --> 01:12:34,280
director of microbiology can have that conversation with infection prevention or the director of infection control,

630
01:12:34,280 --> 01:12:39,320
or someone so that they know that we're all trained to do what's best for the patient.

631
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:47,000
But you, if you provide too much information, it can be dangerous.

632
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:54,950
Well, you know, specimens quote the the antibiotics susceptibility testing should be done only on clinically significant isolates.

633
01:12:54,950 --> 01:13:04,110
Not at all microorganisms in culture. I can't say this enough times. If we do it on everything, then nothing is useful.

634
01:13:04,110 --> 01:13:13,680
Microbiology lab results that are reported must be accurate, significant and clinically relevant.

635
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:20,070
We are in the laboratories. We are licensed licensed laboratories in every hospital,

636
01:13:20,070 --> 01:13:30,020
and we have to follow the standards from the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute as well as CDC and other organizations.

637
01:13:30,020 --> 01:13:36,780
OK, we all use the same guidelines when we're setting things up, doing culture, setting tests that we all use, the same guidelines we have.

638
01:13:36,780 --> 01:13:42,870
They have to be clinically relevant and accurate.

639
01:13:42,870 --> 01:13:50,550
And we do proficiency testing four times a year on every possible type of specimen in the laboratory.

640
01:13:50,550 --> 01:13:54,420
OK. The laboratory should set technical policy.

641
01:13:54,420 --> 01:14:01,800
This is not the purview of the medical staff. Good communication and mutual respect will lead to collaborative policy.

642
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:09,480
So if you're an infection prevention hospital less and you're talking to a physician, maybe an ID physician,

643
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:17,790
infectious diseases and then a specimen to the lab and you want everything identified.

644
01:14:17,790 --> 01:14:18,720
They won't do it.

645
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:27,030
However, if as the infection prevention or infectious diseases physician you call the lab say, Hey, this is the reason I ordered it like this.

646
01:14:27,030 --> 01:14:28,770
We've got a problem. This is about cancer.

647
01:14:28,770 --> 01:14:40,600
Patients in compromised makes all the difference in the world that that communication helps you, helps your patient of the laboratory.

648
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:46,170
It's good all the way around. There can be arguments. There can be disagreements.

649
01:14:46,170 --> 01:14:55,270
The lab. OK. Finally, specimens must be labeled accurately and completely,

650
01:14:55,270 --> 01:15:03,970
so that interpretation of results will be reliable label such as eye and wool are not helpful to the interpretation

651
01:15:03,970 --> 01:15:14,140
of results without more specific site and clinical information such as dog bite or all the right finger makes a big,

652
01:15:14,140 --> 01:15:20,770
big difference to provide the necessary information to the laboratory.

653
01:15:20,770 --> 01:15:25,840
The microbiology lab is so they know what your concerns are, what you're trying to get at.

654
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:31,720
If you say dog bite, we're going to look for cabinets and, if you will, a few other really bad organisms.

655
01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:38,140
Otherwise, you know, we'll say normal flora. And that is it.

656
01:15:38,140 --> 01:15:52,010
Do you have any questions? No questions, well, I will still say, download this article.

657
01:15:52,010 --> 01:16:00,140
It will help you for your careers, physician nurses, infection prevention, it will help.
