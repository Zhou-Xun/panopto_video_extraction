1
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:14,480
Think about the important diseases in your own life. Recently, my family has been impacted by ALS.

2
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:19,490
Perhaps in yours you have a family history of breast cancer or Alzheimer's disease.

3
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:22,730
Maybe have a friend who was recently diagnosed with lupus.

4
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:30,110
Often when we have people in our lives impacted by disease, we think about how common these outcomes are.

5
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:35,840
Have you ever wondered, for example, if it happens more frequently in certain places than others,

6
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:40,550
or whether or not the frequency of the diseases that you're seeing have changed over time?

7
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:50,570
Counting how many people in a population have key diseases or their risk factors is one of the most important jobs of an epidemiologist.

8
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:56,749
In this first week, we're going to talk about how epidemiologists assess the burden of death and disease

9
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:02,600
in populations and how we go about detecting unusual events either by plays,

10
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:06,170
person or time. Now,

11
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:14,959
many of the basic terms that I'm going to talk about really throughout the course you will have heard before in previous coursework in this class,

12
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,590
what my goal is, is basically to grow your knowledge like a tree.

13
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:29,060
So start with the core bits that you've already learned previously and then add new rings and depth of information as we progress through the class.

14
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:39,950
Ultimately, our goal is to really understand in a deep way the way in which epidemiologists describe and track death and disease in our populations.

15
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:48,000
For this particular unit. We're going to start with his core concepts of prevalence and incidence that you've heard before.

16
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:54,630
You may recall that prevalence is the proportion of the population that is currently living with the disease,

17
00:01:54,990 --> 00:02:00,900
whereas incidence is all about the proportion of a population that's developing disease newly.

18
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:06,240
We can talk about prevalence and incidence as proportions and rates.

19
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:13,680
And really together, these kind of measures help us to understand the extent to which a disease is

20
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,630
impacting populations and what might be causing the development of new disease.

21
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:23,610
Again, because this core knowledge here you've heard before,

22
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:29,150
I'm going to start talking about this pretty briefly before we move on to the next topics.

23
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:36,270
After discussing these most basic measures of incidence and prevalence and what they are and how we use them,

24
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:41,370
we're going to talk about how we calculate more robust measures of risk under

25
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:47,390
situations where the populations are in flux or are changing effectively.

26
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,660
What we're going to do is teach you how to use actuarial and kaplan-meier

27
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:56,730
approaches to estimate cumulative incidence again when the population is changing.

28
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:01,860
I'll also talk about how incidence rates can be used in this setting as well.

29
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:08,780
Next, I'll talk about how the different measures of death and disease in populations relate

30
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:13,489
to one another so that we can think about how we can move between an incidence rate,

31
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:20,510
for example, and a risk, or how we can move from prevalence to incidence in doing so.

32
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:26,270
We're going to talk a bit about some of the math that underlies these relationship, and I'll show you those equations.

33
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:31,430
In addition, what I'm going to try and do is teach you a bit of the intuition behind the math as well.

34
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:36,330
Finally in what I consider to be quite the fun stuff of all of this,

35
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:43,110
we're going to look at the trends by place and by time for different risk factors, for different outcomes.

36
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:48,660
And think about how we interpret these differences in prevalence or incidence by place,

37
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:55,380
whether or not they're real and causal, or whether or not that might be due to other non causal factors.

38
00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:02,950
Across all of these different videos. What I hope that you're going to learn is really how to distinguish prevalence from

39
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:08,830
incidents and truly understand which measure you want to use under different circumstances.

40
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:17,170
Next, we're going to talk about how you can calculate measures of risk, measures of incidents in these stable populations,

41
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:22,150
as well as in populations that are really under flux and changing over time.

42
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:29,350
We'll talk about how you convert between incidents and prevalence and incidence and incidence rates.

43
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:35,920
Finally, we'll wrap up the unit by interpreting differences in disease trends by person, place and time.
