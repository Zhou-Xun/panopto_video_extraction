00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:10,310
Hello again. Welcome to the class of public housing for seven.

2
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:15,890
I want to thank you for your interest in this class.

3
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:22,400
I still would like to hear more about why you choose to take this class.

4
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:38,570
Especially, I know the time of the class is not ideal, but I'm very encouraged and excited that the same steer we have for the full capacity fields.

5
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,360
And I really appreciate your interest in this course.

6
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:50,570
I will tell you a little bit more why I developed the course.

7
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:54,710
What's the thinking behind developing the course?

8
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:08,360
But I also would like to invite everyone to talk about it to show the reason you choose to take this course.

9
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:17,720
I will concede all of your reasons in my teaching of different topics,

10
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:27,980
and hopefully you're aware of your goals for taking this course or the maths at the end of the semester.

11
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:35,930
And also with you, I want to apologize for not being able to meet you in person today,

12
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:52,520
as I had been looking forward to since I saw the registration and and I recognize many of the names who were in my previous class.

13
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:57,110
I was also very excited seeing so many new names.

14
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:03,110
We're I'm looking forward to seeing all of you in person next week.

15
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,400
I had the exam this morning. Follow up.

16
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:17,300
And this seems as if we're taking some time to recover, but I feel I should be able to do in person next week.

17
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:26,210
So it's moving to the right direction. But I do apologize for not being able to meet in person today.

18
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:37,460
And so to start, I yeah, we have 30 students in the class and I see that.

19
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:43,520
I see 21 students something I hope they.

20
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:49,840
We're doing shortly all. They?

21
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:59,129
Couldn't come for some personal reason, instead of not saying these this announcements I made last night.

22
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:12,630
So I didn't make it early because I was hoping keep hoping my I would get better and to the point that I

23
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:22,770
could do it in costume because right now it's supersensitive to any light work cause they're quite to.

24
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:28,020
My pen. So I couldn't really.

25
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:33,690
I had to close my left eye completely in the costume.

26
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:43,079
Right now, I'm doing this in a box that helps me to overcome the pain that I'm experiencing.

27
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:47,550
So that's why I, you know, I want to do it in person.

28
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:52,990
So I waited. Waited until evening. I didn't feel it's.

29
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:58,860
I suppose that's why I changed. Or I decided this at the very last moment.

30
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:09,930
If any of your housemates were talking about not saying that, please help me to explain why I didn't allow this earlier,

31
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:21,040
because I was really hoping to get to the point I could do any cuts through the wee wee records or the lectures or discussions.

32
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:29,670
So hopefully for those students who missed this class could also listen.

33
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:35,459
It's like it's a watch, it's linked to stocks.

34
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:53,160
I said, Could I wear to the first part, which is an overview after the cuts I when I was the student, I always want to have an open view, of course.

35
00:04:53,520 --> 00:05:03,660
First, I also know the student had to have been to check out the different classes and determine for the,

36
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:12,540
you know, limited the precious time everyone has what would be the most beneficial course for each individual.

37
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:27,060
So I hope to give you an overview to help you to evaluate if this might really meet your goal or expectations.

38
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,700
So that's why I'm going to do that.

39
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:42,330
And before I started, since many of you I haven't met you before, so I thought I would take a quick look at the introduction of my serve.

40
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:52,420
And then I wear invites all the student to introduce yourselves especially and into the show.

41
00:05:52,680 --> 00:06:05,219
The reason you choose to Texas cos especially you have to overcome some inconvenience to two a long cross in the afternoon on Friday.

42
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:14,070
In fact I talk to 3 hours in the morning today too so we all must help for a good reason.

43
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:21,870
We want to do so. About a little bit about my sir.

44
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:29,990
My education or training background includes matters of vaccinology,

45
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:41,360
molecular genetics of microorganism and epidemiology, especially molecular epidemiology.

46
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:54,520
Of the infectious diseases. So I completed my medical training in China and then I did a two year fellowship in.

47
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:07,430
This. The Danish State Serum Institute, which is one of the oldest vaccine institutes of the words.

48
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:13,460
And I did my fellowship in molecular.

49
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:19,480
Biology or genetics for my organs.

50
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:25,520
In Lausanne University School of Medicine.

51
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:31,790
Faculty of Medicine Nichols. Then I did a.

52
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:40,000
Epidemiology, Ph.D. in epidemiology in Copenhagen University.

53
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:57,130
Before I came to us first as a post doctoral research associate at one of the CDC's National Networks for Molecular Epidemiology studying of TB.

54
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:08,890
And I was at that position for five years before I joined the faculty of the University Skin School Comprehensive Department of Epidemiology.

55
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:16,690
I have been here for the longest time of my career, so my research, of course,

56
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:25,749
as you could imagine with my background, I had a lot of interest in studies, the epidemiology of the disease,

57
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:38,229
especially the use and the integration of molecular techniques and the field epidemiology to understand the distribution of the disease in the

58
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:51,970
population and the transmission dynamics in the population and the risk factors associated with this transmission or occurrence of food disease.

59
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:59,260
So as a potential mechanism like a reactivation of old infection or remote infection.

60
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:07,720
So that's my research, part of my research, and I'm also equally interesting vaccine development.

61
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:11,680
My lab has been doing some work actually,

62
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:21,540
which is typically a few people that work in TB vaccine development to use an integration of

63
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:33,210
comparative genomics and bioinformatics tools to identify novel antigens for tuberculosis.

64
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:37,810
One of the oldest still a major challenge of public health.

65
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:42,820
So so that's my research department.

66
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:57,250
And I also had some works with the server undergraduates as students across the University of Michigan campus,

67
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:12,310
including some from our own school powerhouse and some of the research projects of which I was very proud of what they had accomplished.

68
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:17,940
So I hope this, of course, besides the working with doctors, the master's students,

69
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:26,940
I'm also very interesting were working with our undergraduate students at the School Public Health's undergraduate program.

70
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:37,689
That's to have some research course to support, allow students to do some independent study.

71
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:41,310
So if any of the topics that we discussed interest you,

72
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:49,660
you are interested in constituting a course research course and you should talk to and because of this,

73
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:55,809
you help to set up a series of courses for one of my foremost students who actually

74
00:10:55,810 --> 00:11:07,380
poppyseed paper where that's quite a good position so that I know about my faculty.

75
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:17,200
Now I would like to invite all of you to talk a little bit about your background.

76
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:26,260
Please feel free and feel comfortable talking on your radio because I'm not totally talking with one of my eyes.

77
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:33,399
So swelling, cheering. I couldn't see the likeness of the hospital if I had the lights on.

78
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,090
So I didn't.

79
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:47,170
I might need you, but I would like to see if he doesn't mind to feel comfortable if you don't feel comfortable or if your camera's not working today.

80
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:51,340
I'm looking forward to seeing you next. Next week.

81
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,580
Okay. Now I'm going to invite everyone.

82
00:11:54,580 --> 00:12:00,520
I will just record everyone out front to avoid comfortable some who did not.

83
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:06,970
So I will just use my life as I please tell a little bit about yourself.

84
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:10,480
Mostly why you take this one.

85
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:17,890
Okay. So my name is Aria, Amr Junior and the B program.

86
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:22,120
And I took this class because I honestly just thought it was really interesting.

87
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:29,290
I took an immunology course last year and I feel like this kind of builds off of that.

88
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:33,730
But I also like that a my public health was. That's why I took it.

89
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:45,890
Thank you. Yeah. I think $0.01 is this is your motivation for this and you will come to also share your expectation,

90
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:53,450
you know, maybe what you expect to do not to wear a fluctuating occurrence of course training,

91
00:12:53,780 --> 00:13:03,100
but we can integrate after you have all types of why you do this, I will share my motivation to develop this course.

92
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:07,250
Okay. Now let's the do.

93
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:14,630
I hope I am. My name's there. I'm a junior on the track.

94
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:24,170
I took this course because I really liked 370 last semester and how it kind of touched on infectious diseases a little bit.

95
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:32,900
And we kind of touched on like HPV and HIV, and I just kind of wanted to build on that and also took microbiology, which was really interesting.

96
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:37,790
So I feel like that could kind of help in this course and I really just like that course as well.

97
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:43,400
Good. Thank you. Next, Akron.

98
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:49,379
Acronym. Hey. Yeah. My name is Oklahoma.

99
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:58,650
I'm a senior and the B.S. program at the School of Public Health. And I took this task because I really enjoy physiology and infectious disease.

100
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:02,830
So I think this was a great. Good.

101
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:08,110
Thank you. And to. Hi.

102
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:13,960
I'm Andrew. I'm a junior in the B.S. program at the School of Public Health.

103
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:23,980
Excuse me. And. Well, one, I had a really great experience in a class very similar to this last semester.

104
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:28,809
Public health for 13. And it was also taught by a Dr. Yang.

105
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:39,639
And it was super, super fun. And along with that, I'm just really interested in sort of the like communicable diseases and infectious diseases.

106
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:49,570
So and I had a really like insightful like time in public health 370 and I think this is like a really good and useful extension on that.

107
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:54,960
Thank you. Next the Anna.

108
00:14:56,910 --> 00:15:01,230
Hi, I'm Anna. I'm a junior in the B.S. program,

109
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:10,080
and I took this class because I really enjoy just learning about kind of the connections and interdisciplinary fields with,

110
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:15,450
like, infectious disease and non-communicable diseases. So I'm really excited.

111
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:18,520
She was class. Good. Thank you.

112
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:23,610
Next, I think the. Yeah.

113
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,900
Hi. I'm Dalia. I'm a senior in the ABC program.

114
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:34,190
I'm interested in learning more about infectious and chronic diseases.

115
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:40,160
I also took vaccines in public health course with you last semester and I really enjoyed it.

116
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:43,820
So that's why I wanted to take this course.

117
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:48,060
Thank you. Emily.

118
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:58,350
Hi. I'm a junior in the B.S. program, and I took this class because I wanna learn more about infectious diseases.

119
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:02,820
And I haven't taken a class like this yet, so I'm excited to learn more.

120
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:11,170
Thank you, Hannah. Hi.

121
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:20,920
I'm Hannah. I'm a senior in the B.S. program, and I was interested in this class because I am in the background and also minoring in bio.

122
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:27,040
So I'm just very interested in infectious disease and communicable disease and I really enjoy taking 370 as well.

123
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:31,210
So I just took this class. We like a good extension of that knowledge that we learned.

124
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:35,620
Wonderful. Thank you, Julia.

125
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:39,800
Hi. My name is Julia.

126
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:49,280
I am a junior on the bass track and I took this class because I've been specifically interested in epidemiology and I took a class

127
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:58,099
last year that really last semester that really dug deeper into a few specific infectious diseases and the pathology behind them.

128
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:02,420
So I'm hoping to build on that knowledge. Good.

129
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:06,980
Thank you. Lindsay. Nancy.

130
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:11,510
Hi. My name's Lindsay. I'm a junior in the be a program.

131
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:16,010
I took 370 last semester and I absolutely loved it and thought it was really interesting.

132
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:20,450
And this class seems like a deeper dive on similar topics. I'm really excited to learn more.

133
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:25,100
Good, good. Thank you. Next, Lucy, please.

134
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:34,950
Hi. I'm Lucy, I, I'm a senior in the BBC program and I decided to take this class because I feel like we talk a

135
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:39,929
lot about infectious disease and chronic disease and like separate lenses and public health.

136
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:46,890
And I think it's going to be interesting to like combine them together and talk about, like, the progression of infectious disease to chronic disease.

137
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:52,820
Wonderful. Thank you. My name. Marilyn.

138
00:17:53,300 --> 00:18:04,640
Yeah. Hi, I'm Marilyn. I'm a senior in the B.S. truck, and the reason I took this class was kind of similar to some of the other students are saying.

139
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,150
I took vaccines last semester,

140
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:18,510
and I also read a book recently or somewhat recently that was talking about like the link between certain infectious diseases and mood disorders.

141
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:23,420
So I feel like, yeah, just kind of understanding the link between those two is really interesting to me.

142
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:27,170
Thank you. Thank you all.

143
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,040
You all have good reason. Now it's a minor.

144
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:40,250
Hi. I'm Maya. I'm a B.S. I'm a senior, and I take this class because I also really enjoyed 370.

145
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:45,380
I know we talked about like HPV and cervical cancer connection and that was really interesting to me.

146
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:47,630
And then I'm also a pre-med student,

147
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:55,130
so I think it'd be really interesting to just start learning about infectious and chronic diseases before applying to medical school.

148
00:18:56,190 --> 00:19:01,480
Good. Thank you. Next, I'm going to invite to.

149
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,540
Mean food. I did. Did I pronounce correct?

150
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:11,150
Hi. I'm into. I'm also.

151
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:20,360
Sorry. That's okay. I am also a junior in the BHS program.

152
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:29,840
Last summer I spent some time in Vietnam in, like, the HIV sector.

153
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:33,560
And so. And also in.

154
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:45,079
Ding, ding, ding. And I thought that was really interesting. And they talked about different like the different diseases.

155
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:49,490
And there's a disease I never heard about. So I wanted to learn more about different diseases.

156
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:55,970
Good, good. Thank you. And next to you.

157
00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:04,860
Hi. My name is name Matthew. I'm a I'm a senior in the public health track.

158
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:12,209
And I kind of just take this class because I'm really interested in like disease surveillance and infectious disease epidemiology.

159
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:16,200
So I'm planning on going to grad school.

160
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:20,770
So I decided this class would be a great fit. Thank you.

161
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:27,260
Our next lawyer. Hi.

162
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:33,440
I'm Noelle. I'm a junior in the program, and I thought it was really interesting how this class,

163
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:38,630
the description mentioned like co-morbidities between like infectious disease and chronic disease,

164
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:45,470
which is something I heard mentioned in other classes kind of briefly, but I think it'll be really exciting to dig a little deeper into it.

165
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:52,040
Wonderful. Thank you. Serena. Hi, guys.

166
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:56,449
My name's Serena. I am a junior in the B.S. program as well.

167
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:59,599
And just like how some of you guys have talked about,

168
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:07,040
I'm really interested in the connection and the kind of like bridge between infectious and chronic diseases.

169
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:11,450
And I'm really excited to kind of learn more about all of that.

170
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:17,230
Good. Thank you. Next, Samuel.

171
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:22,530
Yeah. Hi, everyone. I'm Simran. I'm a junior in the B.S. program.

172
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:27,030
And the reason why I think I really wanted to take this class is because in undergrad,

173
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:31,440
I started doing more research in RSV and bacterial co-infection.

174
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:37,649
And so this class really focuses on just co-morbidities and just how different diseases interact with each other.

175
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:41,920
So I'm really excited to learn more about it. Wonderful.

176
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:45,380
Thank you. Now, so here.

177
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:51,330
Hi, guys. My name is Joe Hill. I'm a senior in the B.S. program.

178
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:57,840
Reason I took this class is because I really enjoyed 371 to learn more about infectious disease,

179
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:02,129
and I saw how this class linked it to non-communicable diseases.

180
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:05,970
And I thought that was really interesting because. Thank you.

181
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:12,460
Next. Sophia.

182
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:20,489
Hi. I'm Sofia. I'm a junior in the B.S. program in Public Health, and I took 370 last semester,

183
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:23,790
and I was always really interested in the different chronic diseases that we talked about.

184
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:27,320
So I thought this class would be a good fit. Good.

185
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:32,180
Thank you. And next space, Superman.

186
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:39,950
Hi, I'm Superman. I'm a junior in the B.S. program, and I also really enjoyed 370 last semester.

187
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:43,279
And I'm really interested in the epidemiology of infectious diseases.

188
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,760
So I thought this class was perfect. Good. Thank you.

189
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:50,130
And Suzanne, I think we have lots of.

190
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:54,930
Carrie Lee. Oh. Yes to me.

191
00:22:56,490 --> 00:23:01,010
And I think a lot of people have said this, but I, too am a junior in the BHS program.

192
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:06,080
I took 370 last year and I just thought it was really interesting and wanted to like expand upon that.

193
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:11,040
Wonderful. Thank you all for your introduction.

194
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:14,910
I can tell you all helpful. Good.

195
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:22,469
The background to that to Texas costs the number of costs you mentioned in

196
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:29,080
your previous semester that you took in your previous semester or semesters.

197
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:39,860
And I also can tell you or helpful a good reason to want to take this cost.

198
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:57,120
I also think from what I can tell now, the topic because we had were covered in these costs do seem to match what you expect to led.

199
00:23:57,450 --> 00:24:06,890
And they probably will also go a little bit beyond what you currently had for expected to plan,

200
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:14,340
which is a little encouraging for me because I always want to make sure that

201
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:22,469
you know what the students are interested in and it would be covers because

202
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:37,200
I believe we can always adjust the cost designed to best reflect the interest of the students without compromising the major goal of the class.

203
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:51,030
So for that reason, I really invite everyone, encourage everyone to share your feedback calmly as the cost goes up to come to ask the question.

204
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:59,760
Because sometimes the questions make me a student, of course, and make me think about some something that I didn't think about before.

205
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:06,600
So it's a mutual learning experience, learning from each other.

206
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,750
I learn from you and learning from me.

207
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,430
Okay. Thank you again for your introduction. Share.

208
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:20,280
The reason you want to take these costs now, I'm going to tell you a little bit about.

209
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:29,860
The motivation for me to develop this course in 2018.

210
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:39,040
I think I every year before the pandemic, I tried to some to some international converts.

211
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:44,890
One of the things I noticed is in more recent last.

212
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:57,380
Many in developing countries that used to be many impacted by infectious disease

213
00:25:58,010 --> 00:26:06,740
have also had experience the increase of chronic diseases like diabetes,

214
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:10,490
hypertension, lung cancers, all of these.

215
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:23,270
And so I notice on my trip over there was a major shift in public health, education or poverty, education and disease control.

216
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:35,689
I remember when I went back to China, my home country I originally came from, of course I had four left, 13 years, but still I had many connections.

217
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:41,840
Did the ones that are actually good in a children's hospital into some 1415?

218
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:51,290
And then when I went to see the families, I noticed the tie between prevention.

219
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:57,170
It was like everywhere in the park, in the slums.

220
00:26:57,470 --> 00:27:02,690
There were I have related. I saw labels on the stairways.

221
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:09,410
How many steps to reduce? What's the risk level up for the risk for diabetes.

222
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:18,230
I have to be so and you that relate to infectious diseases and like TB China is one of

223
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:28,370
the is the highest the largest the burden of TB also by incidence rates is the highest.

224
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:32,990
The highest incidence is in sub-Saharan Africa.

225
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:46,880
So I noticed this shift. I was concerned because if we don't recognize the links between infectious disease and chronic disease,

226
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:55,340
the public health may be over responding to one needs and to compromise, reduce the resource for other.

227
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:59,600
And for example, the example I mentioned, diabetes and TB.

228
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:10,160
These are closely related and by beating I would increase the risk of TB, TB patients.

229
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:21,190
So the treatments also. You know, compromise treatment effects effectively support diabetes, HIV.

230
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:28,840
So we don't recognize all those the importance of not even speaking up.

231
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:40,000
A lot of people call the disease hides the infectious cause or the disease and then speak out for debate.

232
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:47,860
I also note, though, people have put in so much emphasize lifestyle change, which is.

233
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:54,880
Perfectly reasonable. But it's not how Italy is.

234
00:28:56,330 --> 00:29:03,440
Complete the stretch. So that's why I think I want to develop a course,

235
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:16,580
focus on the links between infections and the disease and the nutrition and the disease and biofilm, the microbiome and the disease.

236
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:22,880
These are very interesting areas to me and to the for future.

237
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:28,370
It mentions the integration of the different fields.

238
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:35,330
This is mean to make the eyes to think you know and.

239
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:49,950
The intervention control for aiding infectious disease or giving chronic disease should not be solely focused on this disease.

240
00:29:50,110 --> 00:30:05,370
So there is a more systematic approach in considering the impact of different types of health condition and the infectious disease or chronic disease.

241
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:13,710
The military impacts the pathogenesis and also in terms of treatments, conflicts.

242
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:20,160
So these are the parts. So I think it's important if we don't take this systematic approach,

243
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:32,310
we focus on a single disease and not think about the system and how our human system actually impacts by by differences.

244
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:39,690
We are exposed to organic microorganisms in the environment or pathogenic organisms,

245
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:47,460
transmits that across the population or different access to necessary nutrients.

246
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:55,770
This all could impact our system's ability to monitor the negative change in our body.

247
00:30:56,100 --> 00:31:06,419
So that's why I think it's very interesting to do this, because at that time I was asked to develop a course for our new undergraduates program.

248
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:19,380
So I come through this course and in fact now even my colleagues in my departments and graduate program sorts, it would be wonderful.

249
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:25,540
Wish we had one for our master's. So maybe I wear it to one for my school.

250
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:37,200
And so I think I, I think it I'm glad you signed up for this course because I think for future human disease prevention control,

251
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:41,370
we really have to think about a systematic approach.

252
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:50,189
And a systematic approach cannot be developed without understanding the links or some of the links.

253
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:58,020
So we know mechanism, molecular mechanisms or pathogenesis while others we are still learning.

254
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:10,080
And you know, even immigration could impact a one once risk, once my microbiome formation.

255
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:18,090
And so there are a lot of interesting work that could impact our way of thinking about what's

256
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:26,490
effective for public health intervention for some of the major infectious or chronic diseases.

257
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:39,450
That's why I think about these because, you know, more recent years, many lifestyle trends in many developing countries,

258
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:47,879
they used to be mostly impacted by TB, HIV or other major infectious diseases.

259
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:51,110
Now they are also so many the.

260
00:32:53,140 --> 00:33:01,640
Is so high incidence of diabetes, for example, a lot of high burden country at low longer developed countries.

261
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:15,790
So I was concerned this is a shift to make people forget some still ongoing challenges to public health, global health.

262
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:23,210
That's why I think it's important to address this, to discuss the links.

263
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:27,020
This is basically to put to my motivation.

264
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:36,440
Yes, words. I developed this to address my concern when observing this shift, this bias,

265
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:44,570
the distribution of poor allocation of resources for education or for disease intervention.

266
00:33:45,800 --> 00:34:02,230
I think also by doing this course, I, I expect to my students and we all where think about more broadly even you are going to medical school.

267
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:10,870
I know many of you have undergraduate students have medical school as their next step but don't you.

268
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:22,930
And the links between the different the since that's a factor human disease don't just think of you know one disease.

269
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:34,280
Isolate the that's where that is to make you go to physician if your goal is to become a physician and for public health

270
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:46,210
is definitely this understanding where really you make for you to think more so when develop happy house strength.

271
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:50,150
So that's my motivation to develop the course.

272
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:56,780
Now I would like to go saw the highlights that you've since in the course of the syllabus.

273
00:34:57,290 --> 00:35:02,600
And then I will answer your question before I do the second session,

274
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:16,740
which is I you know I was starts on it's it could be joined the discussion was over I put a few slides but I'm sure you have all some.

275
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:21,010
The. Has the technique.

276
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:30,480
You've mentioned in the seventies you said, yeah, you also had a good understanding, some basic kinds of genesis of the disease.

277
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:36,060
So that would be good. Are you able to see my skin?

278
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:45,450
Yeah. We can feel. Okay. Thank you. Yeah. So.

279
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:53,360
Few sense. I want to emphasize why this.

280
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:59,250
Oh, I see. Of the office hour I used to.

281
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:04,530
For those of you who were in my class, you know, I used to hike for one hour.

282
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:13,140
But the truth is, sometimes the students don't necessarily have an absence of our that I choose.

283
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:19,230
And then a lot of I end up not really having student visits.

284
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:26,580
So to to allow and to provide the better opportunities for students to come to interact.

285
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:33,390
If I were to pro appointments, I'm just talking about my hour and usually late afternoon.

286
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:42,120
I'm relatively old. I hope this will wear improve through the you know provides more opportunities for

287
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:50,159
after class interaction and so that's one and the goal the learning objectives.

288
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:56,040
I, I hope your work looks soon and we.

289
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:07,770
We're coming back to check and this is in your program and you can match two nine of that.

290
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:15,159
But what I want to explain a little bit aces the cost structure of what we were.

291
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:27,340
If you cover these costs to make this to allow you to make inform the final decision about what you would be taking for this semester.

292
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:32,960
Okay. This course includes 28 sessions.

293
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:45,560
This of this 28 session, 18 lectures and two sessions is a follow up forum.

294
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:54,469
And the two sessions that were structured to discuss and then to review sessions and I see four sessions of assessment

295
00:37:54,470 --> 00:38:02,660
are basically they are two afternoons which were helpful exam by the standard exam would be one and a half hour,

296
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:09,260
but I left to another one and a half hour to accommodate some special needs.

297
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:13,040
Students had some lots for special accommodation.

298
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:21,710
Could they use that extended time other students can with you know to any sudden you like the delay to

299
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:34,430
reflect on your exam or just the rest that's it's good okay so because this is such interdisciplinary work,

300
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:41,719
it's a cross and it's also involved a lots of changing, constantly changing.

301
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:51,770
I don't recumbent I didn't really come into any textbook, but I will post upload some articles.

302
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:59,440
The how you use the article is you don't necessarily have to read to the people, but.

303
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:12,680
After the costs. If you have time reading those, the articles I posted will help you to extend your learning a full.

304
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:17,780
The each topic. So you can read that.

305
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:21,450
You can use that as additional reference when you do product.

306
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:25,780
But that's what's the reading.

307
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:29,800
It's not that you were have to read that before the course.

308
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:36,790
Then I will quiz you. I may help you to be engaged in class.

309
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:46,449
Discuss. So the goal here is, you know, why is can a better understanding of the history,

310
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:51,190
evolution and the global epidemiological transition of major human disease?

311
00:39:51,610 --> 00:40:03,220
I think this translation, this evolution of disease really has led to some changes in public health programs.

312
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:08,170
The matter is the right direction, or rather, as I mentioned early.

313
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:18,070
So important to understand, to understand for some infectious disease that maybe it's not the peak yet in some population,

314
00:40:18,370 --> 00:40:27,700
while other have also the, you know, concurrent increase of both infections and the chronic disease.

315
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:36,550
So these were some epidemiological concept components, as you mentioned, to want to learn epidemiology.

316
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:41,280
So we are learning this at to, you know, a larger scale.

317
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:48,129
It's not so not necessarily one particular disease over time.

318
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:51,940
But this here, it's really a human disease.

319
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:54,490
What's the trend today?

320
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:04,780
And then, of course, through the discussion of all these different courses, I hope to you would develop an appreciation for the links.

321
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:15,850
You really will come concede these links when you are no matter who you are, you become a public health professional or you become a physician.

322
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:30,610
That it was integral to your appreciation for the such link where really make you make more informed decision about how to treat the patients,

323
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:34,420
how to, you know, improve the population.

324
00:41:34,690 --> 00:41:37,840
So health, if you are working in public health sector.

325
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:52,960
So that's the two major goals and the learning objectives to understand the difference of human disease classification system and do your.

326
00:41:53,980 --> 00:42:03,850
These are the points I were discussed today in module one is infectious disease, another is chronic diseases.

327
00:42:04,330 --> 00:42:13,480
And here, I'm not going to spend too much time on this international classification of disease.

328
00:42:13,870 --> 00:42:21,219
That's a more extensible set of coding codes for different conditions.

329
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:32,560
Different disease has a particular code. For those of you who are using medical records, you may need to, you know, decode what's the particular code.

330
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:39,190
It's that's a single use. That's a misuse. But that's more for medical practice.

331
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:43,750
And that's the here I'm introduce you to different human disease.

332
00:42:44,050 --> 00:42:57,220
It's a basic course of PC based pathogenesis of the disease based on the this, you know, the the natural course of the disease,

333
00:42:57,550 --> 00:43:06,160
because these are helpful implication for public health intervention, including vaccines, including program surveillance.

334
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:11,680
Some of you mentioned the surveillance and surveillance.

335
00:43:11,770 --> 00:43:17,170
One of the major some is to, you know, survey for the cause for certain disease.

336
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:30,790
And so the classification system, what I will be discussing after the break, where we focus on course and the outcomes and to the lungs,

337
00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:41,110
natural course of the disease and the pathogenesis of the disease particular tailored to the needs of public health.

338
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:51,520
And then to understand the history, evolution and epidemiological transition of infectious lung infection in different populations of the world.

339
00:43:52,210 --> 00:44:00,850
This is very important because of the introduction of given disease to our population, especially infectious disease.

340
00:44:01,330 --> 00:44:12,470
And that's the same. So for some populations, how human host may have evolved in the cold.

341
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:19,300
Michael and a human have developed immunity.

342
00:44:19,310 --> 00:44:23,960
That's who to respond to the infectious agents.

343
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:33,950
Very different from another population that was very easily exposed to the agent, the infectious agent.

344
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:41,660
For example, TV, I think I mentioned this in my back some cars and to when TB initially was

345
00:44:42,290 --> 00:44:50,660
brought to no summary to the native people by early your consent at that time,

346
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:58,040
TB cause a very acute infection like typhoid.

347
00:44:58,550 --> 00:45:01,890
And to date, nobody concedes that TB is accurate.

348
00:45:01,910 --> 00:45:09,590
In fact, it's really a common infection and so many people infected and even not develop the disease.

349
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:14,480
But initially, when it was initially introduced to this continent,

350
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:23,630
it's a totally different and 20 over 20% people probably would die of the infection high fever.

351
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:33,480
So. Lisa means the coevolution really determine the outcome of food disease.

352
00:45:33,810 --> 00:45:45,660
And the other hand, the African continent has not been exposed to this disease as long as in Europe, for example.

353
00:45:46,050 --> 00:45:58,910
And then some of the you know, even you try some intervention, you don't necessarily immediately bring the disease down.

354
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:10,980
This, you know, human is one of the important players in the evolution of infectious disease outcome of the disease.

355
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:17,340
I will introduce you this is triangle relationship so that's new groups of.

356
00:46:19,790 --> 00:46:22,880
Appreciates what I just say.

357
00:46:23,330 --> 00:46:29,000
And to be familiar with epidemiological evidence for links between major infections and lung

358
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:34,190
infection and to the missile authorities used to generate this evidence were reviewed.

359
00:46:34,190 --> 00:46:43,999
Some studies or some papers. We're showing you how these links established and to be aware of occurrence known

360
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:50,239
as of about the biological and a societal basis for the links between infectious

361
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:56,300
and communicable disease and to understand the implications of this links

362
00:46:58,610 --> 00:47:05,390
between infectious and chronic disease for public health policy and strategies.

363
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:19,370
What competence is really based on what's your current city, your programs and title match it's you can look at so now I'm going to go through the.

364
00:47:21,350 --> 00:47:25,730
Cross design. What we were doing here was.

365
00:47:27,370 --> 00:47:30,550
This today, I gave you an overview.

366
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:34,030
What's the next section? We're starting unit one.

367
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:39,580
Basically, we were talking about epidemiological transition of human diseases.

368
00:47:39,970 --> 00:47:44,500
I think this is very important to understand this transition.

369
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:50,860
Understand where we are in this transition for different population.

370
00:47:51,160 --> 00:48:05,020
We will know how to deal with what would be the most reasonable, rational strategies for that for prevention and control the disease.

371
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:13,450
So I we're first to talk. Let's give you an overview of disease classification system,

372
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:22,420
which I believe in your previous cancer physiology class or other infectious disease course.

373
00:48:22,750 --> 00:48:27,430
You probably have mentioned, but I'm organized. So that's it.

374
00:48:27,970 --> 00:48:35,110
What we discussed today will form a basis for our future discussions.

375
00:48:36,030 --> 00:48:45,220
But you go from you could offer your thoughts to asking questions.

376
00:48:45,670 --> 00:48:51,910
And then we were next week we were talking about epidemiological transition, Syria.

377
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:58,990
What of different series? What are the different models in studying epidemiology transmission?

378
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:04,720
Then I will also introduce you to understand the parts of the transmission.

379
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:12,040
We also could then look into some global patterns of major the disease, human disease.

380
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:17,930
So I will introduce you to the study of global burden of disease.

381
00:49:17,950 --> 00:49:33,560
It's a very extensive study that hosted in University of Washington synapses and then we thinking about all societal course risk factors that we I.

382
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:41,660
The epidemiological transition is also is in a country with an up population.

383
00:49:42,110 --> 00:49:48,580
It's also largely depends on the society's characteristics.

384
00:49:48,590 --> 00:49:53,900
So we want to look into health disparity from a global perspective.

385
00:49:54,200 --> 00:50:04,180
But for epidemiological transition, we were also talk about some of the lessons we learned from the COVID 19 pandemic.

386
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:09,989
Then the units too. We were kids.

387
00:50:09,990 --> 00:50:21,120
The first unit is some basic is the concept down each and to form a basis for future discourse.

388
00:50:21,450 --> 00:50:25,080
The second unit is a select people.

389
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:36,340
Select kids are set up with theses witchy and important human disease from both

390
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:47,560
infectious disease standpoint and to cancer chronic disease control standpoint.

391
00:50:47,890 --> 00:50:54,790
So first is the hepatitis B, C virus infection and the liver cancer, human HPV.

392
00:50:54,790 --> 00:50:58,240
And two, severe cancer. And the H.

393
00:50:58,540 --> 00:51:03,670
Pylori infection and the gastric cancer. These are three major.

394
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:09,100
Infectious agents. That's the vaccine approach.

395
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:14,710
You have made a contribution to control for the cancer.

396
00:51:15,250 --> 00:51:20,020
They are. We are to establish the course for cancer.

397
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:26,380
Then more emerging problem is AIDS related malignancies.

398
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:32,740
So the control of food. You know, AIDS, HIV infection.

399
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:36,790
It's not just the impact of the AIDS.

400
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:43,990
Does it also impact so many cancers?

401
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:50,250
And so especially now with the increase,

402
00:51:50,260 --> 00:52:05,350
the life expectancy among HIV infected people due to the success of antiretroviral treatment and that we have for people with HIV infection,

403
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:09,160
live longer. And this, of course, also.

404
00:52:11,010 --> 00:52:19,310
For the new challenges. One of them is the cancer AIDS related malignancies.

405
00:52:19,990 --> 00:52:26,060
So that's something I want to talk about and the diabetes and tuberculosis,

406
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:34,630
how they impact each other and what we should do in terms of public health intervention

407
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:41,310
strategies to control both once a major chronic disease and some major infectious diseases.

408
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:57,280
And one of the very practical discussion in the field is should we skinny, you know, avert the type of patients for TB or if the TB is cured,

409
00:52:57,790 --> 00:53:06,490
when the patients that develop the type vitis should, this starts another one type of preventive treatment.

410
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:16,600
These are all practical decisions from both the public health and the medical management system, and the results are good.

411
00:53:16,630 --> 00:53:21,290
Understanding the links, how they impact each other.

412
00:53:21,310 --> 00:53:24,880
It will not be possible to think about any strategies.

413
00:53:26,230 --> 00:53:37,450
Can then this this topic was mentioned above all had something to do with how an infection could increase the risk

414
00:53:37,450 --> 00:53:47,440
of other chronic disease or is presents a challenge for the management of some chronic disease and vice versa.

415
00:53:47,710 --> 00:53:53,500
But then cancer can also increase people's risk of infection.

416
00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:56,940
So it's not a one way impact.

417
00:53:56,950 --> 00:54:07,300
It could be post future. So that's what we will be focusing to discuss in the second units.

418
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:19,090
Basically, we want to illustrate to illustrate this mutual relationship can go hand, you know, in both directions.

419
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:24,910
And then we were discussing how we use this, you know,

420
00:54:25,330 --> 00:54:37,530
actually develop food when we come to determine what's the best strategies to address the epidemic for one of these a

421
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:49,060
disease discussed what we should do as a what would be more comprehensive approach considering such important links.

422
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:58,910
So that's what we were doing. Then the next, then we will have the exam, the third of the parts.

423
00:54:58,990 --> 00:55:09,220
It's also quite interesting and also reflects some, you know, a very latest understanding of food,

424
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:16,480
nutrition and of human disease and the nutrition, human microbiome and the health maintenance.

425
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:23,830
These are all important emerging topics relative to new topics in the field.

426
00:55:24,670 --> 00:55:29,770
First, I would have an introduction to human microbiome.

427
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:39,040
I know many of you have heard about this, and I if any of you have been involved in some research.

428
00:55:39,170 --> 00:55:52,180
Please let me know. I might give you some time to share your research findings or your research approach any of the topics we plan to cover.

429
00:55:52,510 --> 00:56:04,419
I would like I would appreciate your input if you have for some some relate to each of the topics, as you definitely should during the presentation.

430
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:07,750
Give or let's share a little bit of your your work.

431
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:12,570
I think that would be wonderful. That will make the lending teaching more interesting.

432
00:56:13,330 --> 00:56:21,070
And then another thing I find very fascinating is immigration and human microbiota evolution.

433
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:26,470
I have I read some very interesting articles from Nature Medicine,

434
00:56:26,830 --> 00:56:36,850
and that's why I decided to answer this how immigration from, for example, Southeast Asian country to United States.

435
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:43,570
How's the new generation of immigrants succumb to such generation?

436
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:54,670
How their microbiota evolve differently from their ancestral microbiota or their older generations?

437
00:56:55,060 --> 00:57:05,050
This is very interesting, giving microbiome microbiota, important role in human health maintenance.

438
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:09,670
Understand how human activities society.

439
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:14,100
The change could impact these. It's very important.

440
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:26,820
Then we will talk about a couple of examples of the, you know, got some microbiome and human disease,

441
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:34,560
including cardiovascular risk, risk and then your degenerative diseases.

442
00:57:35,550 --> 00:57:38,730
Then nutrition and the house.

443
00:57:40,890 --> 00:57:46,680
We're having for two sessions on the unit three.

444
00:57:47,010 --> 00:57:50,670
Unit four is really using only.

445
00:57:51,330 --> 00:57:55,050
That's what we have discussed.

446
00:57:56,280 --> 00:58:01,860
And to hike through a group or discuss what our students would be.

447
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:05,710
Grouped into.

448
00:58:07,780 --> 00:58:20,440
You know, I see people grow, leave, and then we make up presentations on lessons learned from studies of links between infectious and chronic disease,

449
00:58:21,850 --> 00:58:35,680
evidence and mechanism and implication. So this forum is meant to kind of wrap up the wants of these costs, but also extend what we discussed.

450
00:58:36,190 --> 00:58:50,349
So you will be looking to literature. I may assigned you to particular topics when you observe the first exam and then we

451
00:58:50,350 --> 00:58:59,110
will have some structure to discuss particular questions also based on the course,

452
00:58:59,110 --> 00:59:06,760
but also require some further thinking based on what we discussed here.

453
00:59:07,060 --> 00:59:13,230
And I always do a final review and then we were hyperlinks.

454
00:59:13,990 --> 00:59:19,990
I think that's what I had planned to talk in the first session.

455
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:31,190
We had to. Sometimes some 20 minutes, less than 10 minutes to discuss any questions for the cast.

456
00:59:31,220 --> 00:59:38,720
Does this something interesting, exciting and sounds like what you expect to learn?

457
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:45,980
Going to stop the the. This sounds really interesting.

458
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,360
Thank you, Professor. Oh, good. Yeah, please.

459
00:59:49,720 --> 01:00:00,670
This is my tentative. Well, you know, I had to develop something to stop this, but as the week the course goes,

460
01:00:01,090 --> 01:00:15,760
you are very will come to ask, you know, to request for new particles and all how we extend our discourse in some way.

461
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:20,530
And so that we're all. You will come.

462
01:00:20,860 --> 01:00:24,150
And we also. Yeah.

463
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:31,430
If anything was not so quite in detail or clearly explained.

464
01:00:31,450 --> 01:00:42,030
I also hope you were keeping me time when you've say the back so that we can, you know, address.

465
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:45,620
I can address your concern. Or such as how?

466
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:54,050
Any other questions? I had a question about the forum.

467
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:59,269
So yeah, you mentioned that you may assign some topics.

468
01:00:59,270 --> 01:01:05,240
Do you think you'll most likely make a list of topics for us or will we get to kind of choose what we want to do?

469
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:14,660
I will probably is because the one of the sense is you will be.

470
01:01:16,390 --> 01:01:19,420
Everyone presents the same if I see lessons.

471
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:27,430
People may approach it differently, but I will make sure major lessons were covered.

472
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:42,700
So I may make a list of school since I think, you know, particular lesson for these costs that could be discussed in details.

473
01:01:43,090 --> 01:01:48,510
Then I were randomly assigned the different topic to group.

474
01:01:52,510 --> 01:01:57,280
I think we have 30 students. I would say three students will be in one group.

475
01:01:58,360 --> 01:02:02,090
And it could be two groups share one topic.

476
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:08,620
And I also want to save forum in some points, but it's largely participation.

477
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:14,049
I don't usually have students in my previous class.

478
01:02:14,050 --> 01:02:22,350
I have done this. I know students try very hard to come up with the best presentation they could made,

479
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:30,880
and sometimes for some particular topics or countries, there might be less information than other.

480
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:34,180
So I think it's more participation.

481
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:41,200
It's seriously preparing for presentation, contributing to the discussion.

482
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:47,920
So you don't need to worry about too much, you know, points or grades.

483
01:02:48,250 --> 01:02:52,970
Just try your best to enjoy with the reading literature.

484
01:02:52,990 --> 01:03:01,920
But I will have very detailed instructions for the forum part of your after the second term.

485
01:03:01,930 --> 01:03:05,500
I will also have to notes after the exam.

486
01:03:06,010 --> 01:03:10,090
What resources? Second half of this semester.

487
01:03:10,810 --> 01:03:15,400
And I will also alongside the group by that time.

488
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:30,360
Yeah and yeah. As a questions. It's the first day of the course.

489
01:03:30,390 --> 01:03:37,420
I hope you all. Feel goods and no ax to break.

490
01:03:37,420 --> 01:03:47,480
Come back. And it's not. And it is, of course. If if you don't have any questions, maybe we can pick up right now.

491
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:58,840
You can also, you know, is stop by or we we meet next week to ask additional questions or go back to look at the syllabus or email me if you have

492
01:03:58,840 --> 01:04:08,410
a question right now I and maybe a letter so is my email response to because I just couldn't look at subsequent lectures.

493
01:04:08,650 --> 01:04:14,410
I basically use the one I my other eyes still totally blurred.

494
01:04:14,770 --> 01:04:30,390
So yeah if you don't have and of course that's coming back at 220 so that we can probably finish by 20 minutes before 4:00.

495
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:34,700
And so. 350.

496
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:38,570
Yeah, we have lost 30 minutes of break for now.

497
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:47,780
Okay. I know I can post.
