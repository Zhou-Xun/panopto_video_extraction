Hello and welcome to this two-part podcast series on climate change and the city of Detroit. For this first

2
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:16,640
installment will be exploring how climate change is affecting air quality and the health of Detroiters.

3
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:25,340
Later, you can tune back in to the second podcast, where we'll dove into potential solutions to reduce the impact of climate change on Detroit.

4
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:30,920
First things first climate change. How does it affect the air we breathe?

5
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:38,330
Climate change is caused by the burning of fossil fuels, which releases carbon dioxide into our atmosphere.

6
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:46,010
Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas which traps the heat from the sun and causes temperatures to rise around the globe.

7
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:50,840
When fossil fuels are burned, they also release other harmful chemicals into our air,

8
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:58,190
such as nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds, which are harmful to us when we breathe them in.

9
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:05,810
Now, with climate change, we get a double whammy pollution effect because when those nitrogen oxides and the volatile organic

10
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:11,150
compounds we just mentioned are exposed to the increasing temperatures from climate change,

11
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:22,430
a chemical reaction happens, which forms ozone. Ozone is a major component of smog and is especially harmful to our lungs when we breathe it in.

12
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:28,280
So now that we have all these nitric oxide, volatile organic compounds and ozone in the air?

13
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:36,890
What does that do to our lungs? Those air pollutants that we mentioned above are highly reactive chemicals when we breathe them in.

14
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:41,300
They react with the delicate lining of our airways and cause irritation and

15
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:46,220
inflammation when we breathe in these chemicals over a long period of time,

16
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:56,810
that airway inflammation can turn into asthma. It can also worsen existing asthma and other lung conditions, such as emphysema and chronic bronchitis.

17
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:02,550
Worst of all, exposure to ozone can cause premature death.

18
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:05,970
So we've established that air pollution causes climate change,

19
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:11,400
which in turn makes air pollution worse, which can lead to lung disease and premature deaths.

20
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:21,030
So how does this apply to Detroit? The answer is that Detroit sits at a toxic nexus of air pollution sources DETROIT,

21
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:27,990
the Motor City, the birthplace of the Ford Motor Company and the first mass produced automobile.

22
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:39,180
Metro Detroit has been home to major manufacturing for over a century, from steel mills to auto factories to assault mines to major oil refineries.

23
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:46,980
Most of these are heavily concentrated in southwest Detroit, all powered by big coal power plants.

24
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:55,350
Add to that a major trade thoroughfare between the U.S. and Canada via the Ambassador Bridge, located right in southwest Detroit.

25
00:02:55,350 --> 00:03:00,690
Over 10000 commercial vehicles pass over the bridge on a typical weekday.

26
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:07,320
One zip code in Southwest Detroit Zip Code four eight two one seven sitting right at the heart of that

27
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:14,820
nexus of manufacturing and commercial traffic is known infamously as Michigan's most toxic zip code.

28
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:26,490
The EPA has identified this area as having unacceptably high levels of sulfur dioxide, a major employer, air pollutants produced by coal plants.

29
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:36,100
So what has all this air pollution done to Detroiters lungs? Detroiters have remarkably high rates of asthma compared to the rest of Michigan.

30
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:42,940
In 2019, Detroit adults had 46 percent higher rates of asthma than Michigan at large.

31
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:51,610
Even more shocking, Detroit residents were three times more likely to be hospitalized for asthma compared to the rest of the state.

32
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:58,030
So we've established that Detroit bears the heavy burden of pollution and related asthma rates.

33
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:04,150
Well, we haven't explored yet because the unequal burden of pollution and poor health within Detroit,

34
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:14,530
a burden that falls most heavily on people of color. Let's revisit Michigan's most toxic zip code four eight two one seven in southwest Detroit,

35
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:20,050
this community has more than two dozen major industrial facilities surrounding it.

36
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:28,780
This community is also 82 percent black and has a median household income of twenty four thousand dollars a year.

37
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:33,940
Thirty five percent lower than Michigan at large.

38
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:42,940
In Detroit, like in many other places, there is a market environmental injustice at work in our next episode will explore

39
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:48,580
ways Detroit can move from injustice to environmental justice to concrete action.
