1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,020
We stood outside. It was much later we were like, Oh, yes.

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:08,190
And then came up again. And she was like, So do you want to go? There's more to sure.

3
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:12,990
It was like, Oh, was good. All right, so there's two here.

4
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:17,220
So there's like everything that you would know. But the mystery of the town.

5
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:22,190
And there's nothing. I'm from there. Oh, is it not?

6
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:25,340
Slide show where I can click through. You can click through up there.

7
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:30,800
But like the animation. Oh, yes. It's like stuff.

8
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:39,830
It's like, yes, I can download it. I can download it because if not, I can pull it up as a PowerPoint from my email and I can be downloaded.

9
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:43,060
I guess we have the green light to go or whatever.

10
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,630
I'll go to that thing. There you go.

11
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:54,320
So it's just down here. Is it? Is that what you have to do here to enable the PowerPoint?

12
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:01,150
So was sure that her delay enabled putting us right.

13
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:10,549
One year, I'm looking for anything in your life.

14
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:14,930
And he's never talked about roads.

15
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:18,060
And I was like, I just have to figure out how to do that.

16
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,320
I would just click that enable editing button. Yeah, we're right on target.

17
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:25,580
Yeah, track. That should be good. Perfect.

18
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:32,830
Awesome. All right. Welcome, everybody. And I'm sure more people will be okay.

19
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:39,140
And it sounds good, but we are very lucky to have you still to come here and talk to us today.

20
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:43,290
And you want to just talk a little bit about how you got here.

21
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:46,660
Yeah, sure. Hello, everyone.

22
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:50,630
My name is Terri Doyle. I am a pediatric infectious disease physician.

23
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:57,769
I'm also an associate hospital epidemiologist and work with Emily and Lorraine,

24
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:03,350
who is coming after us and all of the other infection prevention folks you've met so far this season.

25
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:09,500
And I did my pediatric infectious disease training and residency in Pittsburgh.

26
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:14,450
And during my ID fellowship, we actually had a measles outbreak.

27
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,950
And then soon after the measles outbreak, we had H1N1 come through.

28
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:26,780
And that's actually kind of watching my ID attendings and one of my mentors do all the

29
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:31,040
infection prevention work for that is actually what got me interested in infection prevention.

30
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:38,090
And we actually even had the CDC come up because of our measles outbreak and we did some molecular epi and things like that.

31
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:42,770
And so that's how I landed into the infection prevention world.

32
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:48,440
And it has it is never a dull moment, as I'm sure you guys have learned.

33
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:58,639
And so today I am the sole pediatric infectious disease person that does hospital epi from a physician perspective.

34
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,780
And so I get to tell you about the pediatric side of things.

35
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:11,030
I try to make this a little bit interactive, so please feel free to interrupt and answer questions along the way.

36
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:22,940
Okay, so this is all data you probably know. So this information came from the CDC website and from 2018, the numbers are probably different now.

37
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:26,929
But when I looked recently to see if I could update the data, it hasn't changed.

38
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:30,800
They still say one in 31 hospitalized patients will suffer at least one.

39
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:38,450
And we have definitely seen increases in our health care associated infections with the COVID pandemic.

40
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:42,980
I'm not sure how much everyone has talked to you guys about that previously and the different like device related sections.

41
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:48,650
But we do really think that hospital capacity stressors on health care,

42
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:54,920
worker stressors on the system have really led to an increase nationwide of health care associated infections,

43
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,080
both on the adult side and on the pediatric side.

44
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:03,379
So previously you had they've been talking to you guys about like SARS and like standard infection ratios.

45
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:05,210
Okay. So that's the current situation.

46
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:12,770
Previously we used to do kind of mean averages and and different ways that they used to survey the data for NHS in.

47
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:20,240
And so back in 2011 they used to now we get an ACR every year before they used to pool means over a couple of years.

48
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:23,300
And so this is some data that I pulled from back in the day.

49
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:30,020
So in 2011, in that like three year time period, they saw an HCN reported at least 30,000,

50
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:35,660
at least 33,000 infections in the neonatal ICU and 19,000 infections in the well baby nursery.

51
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:41,480
So even in the spaces in the pediatric hospital where you are supposed to be born and healthy and just go home,

52
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:44,000
we still have a lot of issues on the pediatric side.

53
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:52,670
More recently for the NHS in 2020 data, this is annually they reported 1500 classes in pediatric patients,

54
00:04:52,880 --> 00:05:00,950
470 surgical site infections, 350 cordis, 810 cases of C difficile infections and 125 mersa bacteremia.

55
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:06,980
So we are a smaller population as opposed to adults, but we still have a lot of infections to deal with.

56
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,020
There is a group that started several years ago initially called the Ohio

57
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:15,560
Collaborative because it came out of the children's hospital networks in Ohio.

58
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:21,770
Now it is called the Solutions for Patient Safety, and it involves over 80, if not more.

59
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:27,799
Now pediatric hospitals, where we collaborate on quality improvements around health care,

60
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,590
associated infections and other health care associated conditions.

61
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:39,650
And so their data shows that for pediatric numbers, a Clancy will cost an additional $31,000.

62
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:43,640
A surgical site infection will cost an additional $27,000.

63
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:49,969
A ventilator associated infection will cost an additional $51,000 because you're in an ICU,

64
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:55,970
obviously, and then a catheter catheter related UTI will cost up to an extra $1,000.

65
00:05:55,970 --> 00:06:02,600
And so not only over causing morbidity and mortality, we are also causing increase in financial impacts on our.

66
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:06,000
Health care system. So kind of a two pronged hit from that perspective.

67
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:12,060
So as I mentioned before, this is just to kind of highlight a little bit of the differences between adults and pediatrics.

68
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:16,830
So these were the old data when they used to do the pooled means over times as opposed to, say, hours.

69
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:24,240
And you can see the types of infection on the left hand side and the adult pooled means in the middle and the pediatric on the right hand side.

70
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:32,010
And you can see for nearly every single one of them collabs these courtes and what we used to call baps or ventilator associated pneumonias.

71
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:37,830
The pediatric side has higher pooled means than the adult side did.

72
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:44,640
So, you know, we we talk a ton about infections in the adult population, but they're also very important in our pediatrics population.

73
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:50,040
So today we're going to talk about the differences between pediatric patients and adult patients.

74
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,500
We're going to talk a little bit about neonatal care.

75
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:59,520
And then we're going to talk about a couple of infections that are specific to children, particularly gastroenteritis and then respiratory infections.

76
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:07,950
So if you've ever been to a pediatric clinic, you know that they can be not so discrete with their secretions.

77
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:14,549
A little girl that I saw two weeks ago had some copious nasal drainage to the fact that her little mask was all wet.

78
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:17,940
So she took it off. And then I went to go examine her lymph nodes.

79
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:22,410
And when I had my arms up, she thought I wanted to hug her. And she tried to hug me.

80
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:31,139
And I said, no, thank you. I took a step back and I said, I actually said, honey, you're a little too Mukasey for Dr. Stoll today.

81
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:37,680
And the dad thought that was funny and the little girl was confused. But kids, kids will definitely just be all over you.

82
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:42,480
You will you will notice that adult physicians wear really nice clothes.

83
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:48,629
Pediatric physicians generally don't. There have been times where kids will sit on my lap and pick their nose and light their boogers on my arm.

84
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:52,080
And then later in the day, I'm like, What is that on my sleeve? Oh, that's somebody's booger.

85
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:57,120
So you just have to be very careful because pediatric patients are very loving and they're very different,

86
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,329
but they're not so discrete with their secretions.

87
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:04,230
So that is one thing. So how are children different from adults?

88
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:09,089
So a lot of people will say that, well, kids are just little adults.

89
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:13,170
They are not children are not little adults and adults are not big babies.

90
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:20,190
They are very different people. And so before we kind of launch into that, we're going to play a game called What's Wrong With This Picture?

91
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,890
Okay. What's wrong with this picture?

92
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:29,670
What do we see here that could be problematic? A stuffed animal.

93
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:34,380
A stuffed animal inside of an incubator next to a neonate.

94
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:43,860
You will see this a lot in the neonatal ICU. A lot of families like to have stuffed animals.

95
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:51,089
They like to have their knitted hats. They like to have their Halloween costumes with these little babies.

96
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:53,970
And so we just have to be mindful of things that are in our environment.

97
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,260
And it was really great when the old ladies like to knit the hats and donate them.

98
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:02,400
But then we have to figure out a way to clean them before we put them on a neonatal head.

99
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:07,950
So generally, you don't have to worry about that so much on the adult side. What about this picture?

100
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:15,350
So cute, huh? So we have pet therapy.

101
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:18,820
On the pediatric side, we even have facility dogs.

102
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:21,940
We have at least five golden retrievers that live in our hospital.

103
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:28,610
And so we have to kind of worry about the interaction with the animals and our patients.

104
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:36,520
There are some particular things oh, I always call it cabinet side aphasia, but some people call it cabinets.

105
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:42,830
So I don't know if there's particular bacteria in the dog's mouth that like if they look, kids can become really problematic.

106
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:47,590
So but we do have hospital dogs. We let them interact with our children.

107
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:54,360
They don't really have those on the adult side, but we do have them on the pediatric side and I'm not sure.

108
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,530
Can anyone guess what this is? It's hard. It's a hard picture, you know.

109
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:07,020
So this is Astroturf. So I came here about five, six months before we moved into the new hospital in 2011.

110
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:13,590
And they have this place on the eighth floor of a hospital called Michigan GameDay Experience, which is supposed to look like a football field.

111
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:19,800
And they were going to put Astroturf in there on the floor to make it more lifelike for a football field.

112
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:24,030
But what might be the problem with that if you put your infection prevention hat on?

113
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,090
What could be the problem? It's going to hurt.

114
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:35,550
Exactly. So how are you going to clean that if, like, the kid throws up on it?

115
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:41,520
The diaper gets a little leaky, you know, all these different things. And so we were like, you need to pick a different flooring.

116
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:44,610
So now we have a nice flat floor that you can clean really well.

117
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:46,980
But these are things that like,

118
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:54,390
who would have thought when I came out of my ID fellowship that I'd be consulting on Astroturf in the playroom and how you kind of clean that.

119
00:10:54,390 --> 00:11:02,550
So always a good time on the pediatric side of things. So the difference is in pediatrics, the best part about pediatrics is we take care of babies,

120
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:08,700
we take care of toddlers, you take care of school age kids and how we can take care of her because she's still 25.

121
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:14,759
So we have a wide range from birth or even prenatally to about 25 in our pediatric population.

122
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:20,340
When COVID came, they actually licenses it's up to 35, which made a lot of us very uncomfortable.

123
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:26,309
But, you know, the adult hospital was kind of getting really full, so they wanted to be able to flex privileges across the way.

124
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:29,700
But we have a very wide range of of individuals that we care for,

125
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:33,299
which means we have a lot of differences to kind of look out for with regards

126
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:40,020
to their care and then how we keep them safe while they're in the hospital. So how are kids different than adults, basically?

127
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,730
So there are some physiological differences.

128
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:48,150
We say that they have an uneducated immune system, which means the first time they're seeing infection is usually their primary infection.

129
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,150
And so they don't have antibody responses to that.

130
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:57,300
Most of these kids are not you know, you don't get fully vaccinated with your primary series until you're at least 15 months old.

131
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:02,820
And then you get booster again around 4 to 6 years of age, depending on what your school system is like.

132
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,580
So a lot of them don't have the benefit of vaccines,

133
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:10,829
but they're on an increased likelihood of infection because of the first two things and because they how

134
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:16,830
they interact with their environment and they're at an increased risk for increased severity of disease,

135
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:18,780
which then can make setting more of a problem.

136
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:26,579
Infections usually affect kids a little differently because there are different organisms like certain things and we'll talk about RSV later,

137
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:31,709
but certain things will make kids sick that don't usually make adult sick and sometimes kids will have different symptoms.

138
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:34,200
So when H1N1 first came around,

139
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:40,770
a lot of the symptoms on the pediatric side were actually fever and vomiting and diarrhea before they got their respiratory symptoms,

140
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:47,220
which made it very challenging for individuals to know that that was really influenza, because that's not usually how you expect it to present.

141
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:50,430
You know, that data has changed a little bit over time, but, you know,

142
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:55,110
things are symptoms that they'll have a different infections can be very different from the adults.

143
00:12:55,110 --> 00:13:01,709
And so that's just kind of challenging from that perspective. Pediatric patients will shed longer with regards to viruses.

144
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:05,730
So you or I can have an infection we might shed for, you know, allergies.

145
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:09,300
With COVID, everyone's looking at like seven days, ten days, things like that.

146
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:14,339
For some of those initial viral illnesses, pediatric patients can shed for several weeks and sometimes up to four weeks,

147
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,319
if not longer, depending on what their infection is.

148
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,630
So that means that even if they're not having symptoms, they could still be shedding these viruses,

149
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:28,320
which creates a problem from an infection prevention perspective. And then they also have some patients will have congenital anomalies,

150
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:35,070
which will kind of factor in to how they what types of infections they get and different sites of shedding.

151
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:41,190
There's also what we call developmental differences. So they definitely interact with their environments differently.

152
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:44,579
So in the pediatric hospital, if they're in the hospital for a long period of time,

153
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:47,010
we actually have playmates that they can put on the floor so they can kind of

154
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:50,700
crawl around and play and still maintain their kind of developmental things.

155
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:58,770
Certainly you don't see that on the adult side. As we noted with our initial picture in story, they are not discrete with their secretions,

156
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:03,690
meaning they just kind of let stuff flow everywhere and doesn't seem to to bother them at all.

157
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:08,880
A lot of them cannot comply with hand hygiene just because they don't have the developmental skills to do so.

158
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:15,209
And they have poor respiratory and toileting etiquette from that perspective because they're just still learning how to do things.

159
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:23,120
But that increases the risk of contaminants in the environment. And we also have family centered and patient centered rounds.

160
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:28,280
So how someone interacts with a six month old versus a six year old versus a six year old are very different.

161
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:32,480
The families at our hospital are very integral to the care. We have all private rooms.

162
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:36,470
And so we actually have beds at the bedside for families to stay.

163
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:40,250
And so, you know, we have families who are staying overnight all the time.

164
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:47,120
And that really has to be you have to be mindful of that when you're kind of thinking of how you're implementing your precautions,

165
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,570
policies, how you're implementing or restriction policies,

166
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:58,280
and the fact that the health care worker is not only going to be exposed to a patient, but also potentially to a family member in the times of COVID.

167
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:08,470
You know, they we shut down visitors and families from visiting our adult patients, but we never took away visitors from the pediatric side.

168
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,809
They were always allowed to have at least one family member present during the

169
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:15,080
entire pandemic because you can't have those kids without their family members.

170
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:21,290
We also on the pediatric side, as COVID started to get a little bit better, if you will, I put that in quotes.

171
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:28,490
You know, we started to increase the number of visitors on the pediatric side long before we were able to do so on the adult side,

172
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:31,190
just because of the social stressors that causes.

173
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:36,840
If you can't have caregivers at the bedside, both for the family and the patient, but also for our nursing staff.

174
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:41,960
Right. So imagine if you have a whole bunch of two year olds that don't have their parents or their caregivers near them,

175
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:45,469
then those nurses are going to have to be in there to help take care of them on a day to day,

176
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:48,680
because you can't let a two year old just hang out in the room by themselves. That can cause a lot trouble.

177
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:56,329
And so, you know, we really had to balance both the needs of the families and the patients and as well as our staff and to allow those resources in.

178
00:15:56,330 --> 00:16:00,950
So that is very different. You can't just shut things down. On the pediatric side, like you can on the adult side.

179
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:06,920
So then you're risking additional exposures, a different additional potential that people are bringing in things.

180
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:11,749
And, you know, a patient might come in and not be sick with COVID per se,

181
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:15,110
but then, you know, their parents are kind of coming and going and switching off.

182
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:18,919
And so then they're kind of getting risk of still being exposed from the outside world.

183
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:22,100
So something that is a little different than on the adult side.

184
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:29,650
And then we have toys and playrooms and waiting rooms. So everyone thinks that these things are really cool.

185
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:33,670
I look at them and think that they're fomites because they're really hard to clean.

186
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:39,790
We actually got rid of a lot of the stuff in the waiting rooms for kids when I first got here.

187
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:46,420
There used to be tons of stuff in the waiting room. Now, basically, child life will provide you with something that you can take home,

188
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:50,230
so they'll usually give you a coloring book and some crayons and things like that.

189
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:51,760
But it's for your own personal, you see,

190
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:56,890
you can take home so that there's kids not drawing on a whole bunch of different magazines that are hanging out in the waiting room.

191
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:04,060
They also used to have a lot of these a lot of these wall type activities, but, you know, they're really hard to clean.

192
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:08,260
So we actually had one I think we had one on the eighth floor somewhere.

193
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:15,670
And we like spent a lot of time with our environmental services folks being like, how are you going to clean that?

194
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:20,469
And every time a new project opens up, you know, we have to be mindful.

195
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:26,410
They opened something called Sophie's Room, which is a music space that they opened up recently.

196
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:32,500
And they it's very beautifully decorated, but it has a lot of stuff, like a lot of records and things hanging from the ceiling.

197
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:40,440
And we had to think, how are you going to clean those? Like, is your environmental services person going to go and like dust those every single day?

198
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:45,640
There's like hundreds of them. And so, you know, there's fun things you need to think about that you're doing.

199
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:51,940
But then also, too, sometimes you have to be the fun killer because sometimes you have to be like, I don't think that that's a great idea.

200
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,020
Sometimes you get overwhelmed, but at least you can provide them with the knowledge.

201
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:02,140
We also have, let's see, a group activities in schools.

202
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:05,500
So we actually had one patient who lived in our hospital for two years.

203
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:10,810
We have cystic fibrosis patients that come in a lot and like serve for a really long periods of time.

204
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:15,909
So we have a school room in the hospital and a couple of teachers that we have.

205
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:21,729
So you kind of have to worry about what your policies look like for those patients going in and out of the school rooms.

206
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:25,300
If they can go into the school room or if they can have school brought to their bedside.

207
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:30,160
So that's obviously something that you have to worry about on the adult side. We talked about pet therapy.

208
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:33,880
Everyone thinks it's cute. I think that's gross because you know where that tongue has been.

209
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:41,230
And then obviously we have visitors and siblings. So those are some of the main differences between our two worlds.

210
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:47,260
Any questions on that? Awesome. Okay, so, neonates, let's talk about neonates real quick.

211
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:54,760
So technically, so we have a neonatal icu and technically of use the term neonatal, it usually means like 28 days or younger,

212
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:03,760
but neonatal patients and neonatal patients in the ICU can actually be in our ICU for up to a year plus if they're born super premature.

213
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:12,690
And so kind of caveat on how you determine the term neonatal but risk factors in the neonatal population, meaning the baby, baby babies.

214
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:21,460
So anywhere from 20 to 30% of the neonatal, if they survive, the first 48 hours of life, will ultimately get a hospital acquired infection.

215
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:26,800
And a lot of this has to do with a couple of different factors. One, their immune system naivete.

216
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:36,340
So babies that are born premature, particularly if you're born before 30 weeks, starting around 30 weeks gestation,

217
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:41,140
is when maternal antibodies cross over the placenta and start getting transferred to the baby.

218
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:45,520
And so if you're born before that, they won't have the benefit of mom's maternal antibodies.

219
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:54,820
And also, if you're born even earlier than that, like 23, 24, 25 weeks, your kind of t cell, thymus, things like that are not fully developed.

220
00:19:55,300 --> 00:20:04,959
And so they basically have a lot less of an immune system coming into a very potentially I wouldn't say dirty,

221
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,790
but like potentially bacteria in space without a lot of protection.

222
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:15,520
Let's see here. Oh, yeah. So they also have an increase like Miss Day.

223
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:22,690
So, you know, some of those babies are going to be in there for gosh, I think I think the longest one I've seen recently is probably 13 months.

224
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:25,719
And so, like the longest, the longer you're there, like, you know,

225
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:31,120
if you're born at 23 weeks and you have a lot of complications, you're going to have a lot of central lines.

226
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:33,610
You're going to have your breathing tube.

227
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:40,570
You're going to have a lot of procedures kind of done to you in order to keep you healthy enough for you to grow and develop.

228
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:47,740
We don't have as many Foleys in the neonatal ICU or like urinary catheters because you can just diaper them and that's fine.

229
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:51,370
But their increased length of stay is going to increase their risk for infection

230
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:55,840
because of the things that we have to do to them to make them survive.

231
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:02,950
And just obviously, given their age and their size, they are increased risk for mobility and mortality.

232
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:09,370
Again, this is the previous old data. The pool me data was a bit easier to kind of show some of these differences,

233
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:15,460
but this is the older data from an HSN report in 2011 just to kind of prove the point.

234
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:19,390
We do central line infections and we do it based on birth weight.

235
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:26,200
And you can see the the smaller you are when you're born, the increased risk you're going to have for a central line infection.

236
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:29,889
And a lot of that just has to do with probably the number of lines that we have

237
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:34,540
to place in the babies in the length of time in which those lines are present.

238
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:44,740
From that perspective, also, when babies are born, so generally for most babies who they are born vaginally,

239
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:48,070
they will pick up maternal flora as they're coming out of the birth canal.

240
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:52,509
Right. So babies are or should be sterile when they come out, if that makes sense.

241
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:57,219
Right. They've been in this very protected space and they technically should not really have

242
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:00,820
a lot of kind of flora in them unless mom's had infections during her pregnancy.

243
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:06,790
And when babies are born badly, they pick up some bacteria on the way out of the birth canal.

244
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
And that's how they establish their colonized flora.

245
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:17,500
For babies that are really premature and are born into an ICU, for the most part, they are emergent born, so they are born via C-sections.

246
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:24,280
And so when they're coming out and they like don't get to bond with their moms, they're like basically taken from the space that they're born in.

247
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:31,240
They're taken into this ICU. So the established kind of colonized flora is really the flora and the bacteria that are in an ICU,

248
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:34,510
which you can imagine for babies who are there for a long period of time.

249
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:40,870
We use a lot of antibiotics in the ICU. So instead of just kind of the routine kind of maternal flora that you would pick up,

250
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:46,360
you could be picking up some more resistant organisms off the bat just because of the space that you're in, if that makes sense.

251
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:54,639
They also have thin skin. And I like to say it's not because I can't take a joke now, but they actually like usually the 22,

252
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,930
23 or 24 week ers, they come out, their skin is very translucent.

253
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:06,160
Their bodies haven't had a chance to kind of make all of that thicken of the epidermis at that point.

254
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:10,180
So they're also at risk for like skin tears. You can't really put leads on them.

255
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:17,650
They also just it gives them a lot more exposure to the environment and for potential ways for bacteria to get into their system.

256
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:23,950
And so usually those are the micro preemies, the kiddos that are born at less than 28, 27 weeks of age.

257
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:29,710
From that perspective, a lot of the time they'll have continuous feeding and TPN,

258
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:34,390
which obviously can be a space for where they can get additional bacteria.

259
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:43,480
A lot of them are on steroids because of lung development. A lot of them have antacids or H2 blockers, which end up just.

260
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:50,550
The acidic environments in their GI tract tend to put them at risk for infections and obviously we use a ton of antibiotics.

261
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:58,170
As I mentioned before, pediatric patients have different organisms in adult patients, particularly in the neonatal ICU, coagulation,

262
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:03,180
negative staff, and most people wouldn't cause an infection, but in a neonatal can actually cause pretty severe disease.

263
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:11,400
And then also staph aureus is probably the next biggest one. They only have Group B strapped for GBS, which generally doesn't impact adults as much.

264
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:19,020
Enterococcus is pretty high on the list E coli and in Canada, so couple of different organisms that we generally think of in our neonatal population.

265
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:26,730
They also have different sites of infections. As I said, we don't usually use urinary catheters, but we do use a lot of central lines.

266
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,340
Most of them are intubated.

267
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:33,930
So there are primarily if you're going to get a health care associated infection, primarily you're going to have central line infections.

268
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:39,750
Unfortunately, the lumens or the catheter are super, super tiny for some of these babies.

269
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:42,000
So that also increases their clot risk.

270
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:48,150
So then if you get a clot, then you're increasing your risk for central line infection and that can be a struggle.

271
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:52,410
We also get a lot of ventilator associated type infections because of how long intubated.

272
00:24:53,310 --> 00:25:01,530
And so that's a little bit different than the adult population. And then we obviously have to have some considerations for breastmilk.

273
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:08,790
So we actually have probably a couple of years into my stay here.

274
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:20,610
I worked with legal and our patients relations group and we actually had to make a non maternal non donor breast milk policy.

275
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,840
So it wasn't maternal for that particular baby.

276
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:31,020
It wasn't coming from a donor bank where they had already done screening and pasteurization,

277
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,310
but it was coming from like a sister or someone down the street.

278
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:39,720
So there are some families who aren't the moms aren't able to produce breast milk,

279
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:43,919
but like their sister just had a baby and their sister wants to provide the baby breast milk.

280
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,830
And so we had to come up with this whole policy of how to do that,

281
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:54,989
to make sure that the families were aware of the risk of transmission that could involve not only from an infection perspective,

282
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:59,129
but like, you know, we don't know what kind of medications those individuals are taking and things like that.

283
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:02,070
So, you know, not something that my adult colleagues have to worry about,

284
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:06,120
but something that, you know, we created a whole policy in order to kind of be patient,

285
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:12,750
friendly, but also be safe for our patients, because some families wanted to choose alternative therapies from that perspective.

286
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:19,020
Bottle formula versus powdered formula. I didn't really pay attention to this when I was a youngster.

287
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:22,920
But bottle formula is sterile. Powdered formula is not.

288
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:28,380
You'll hear every once in a while when maybe the most recent record was probably just in the last year or so.

289
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:34,130
Yeah. So there, there a particular bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae Zaki.

290
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:43,590
And I think it's called Chrono Back or Suzuki, but there's a gram negative that has been kind of linked in years past to formula, baby formula,

291
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:51,989
because it is not commercially sterile as we would expect some of our other products to be in that can cause infections in our pediatric population.

292
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:56,850
So in the neonatal ICU and for the for the baby baby babies,

293
00:26:57,150 --> 00:27:05,460
we use bottled formula because that should be sterile or we have it made in our milk room, but we have on site under sterile processes.

294
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:10,500
And then but most folks that are like out in the real world will use powdered formula.

295
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:15,600
But again, something that our adult colleagues don't have to worry about.

296
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:24,570
Questions on that section. Okay.

297
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:28,470
So infections that are specific to the pediatric population.

298
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,780
So we're going to talk about gastroenteritis and then respiratory infections.

299
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:40,469
So there are a lot of different things about gastroenteritis, but it primarily it can impact everybody.

300
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:46,800
I'm sure everyone around here has had gastro at some point in their lives, but usually it's a pretty high impact on the pediatric population.

301
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:52,440
With nearly 2 million pediatric deaths globally for kiddos that are under the age of five,

302
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:57,150
it is one of the top five causes of death in low to medium income countries,

303
00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:00,989
and it accounts for nearly 10% of pediatric hospitalizations,

304
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:05,220
primarily just because the kids get really dehydrated and have to come in from that perspective.

305
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:08,790
So it can be caused by bacteria, viruses and parasites.

306
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:15,540
And although our testing has gotten a lot better in the health care system, it's sometimes difficult to know what's actually really causing it.

307
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:22,260
So then it's hard to know how to protect against it. This is a list of various things that can cause gastroenteritis,

308
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:30,600
but we are going to focus mainly on rotavirus as being one that is more specific to the pediatric population as opposed to the adult population.

309
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:37,560
So rotavirus used to be.

310
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:39,419
I have to look at the data. I don't know.

311
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:46,320
Norovirus might be winning out now, but rotavirus used to be the most common cause of viral gastritis gastroenteritis in the U.S.,

312
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:49,680
with 80% of children being infected by age five.

313
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:57,060
Prior to the vaccine, they actually used to account for almost 400,000 physician visits.

314
00:28:57,450 --> 00:29:03,120
Anywhere from 200 to 270000 E.R. visits and up to 70 hospitalizations annually.

315
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:09,450
So I interestingly, my training crossed over the time period that this vaccine was made.

316
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:14,099
So I finished medical school in 2005 and was a resident at that time.

317
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:17,310
And we used to see a ton of rotavirus in the health care system.

318
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:19,589
And let me tell you clearly,

319
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:26,190
my intern class and I didn't know how to wash our hands because every single one of us got it in the span of a week time period,

320
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:32,729
started on the nighttime shift, moved to the daytime shift, went back to the nighttime shift on those who didn't get it the first go around.

321
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:37,110
So clearly our resident lounge not so clean and it was pretty rough going.

322
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:42,780
But then and the vaccine came in 2006 and pretty much all of the rotavirus disappeared.

323
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:46,640
It was amazing how effective that vaccine is. So pretty.

324
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:50,910
Vaccine rotavirus accounted for 30 to 50% of hospitalizations.

325
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:54,480
Post-vaccine We saw about an 85% drop in those cases.

326
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:57,390
And so it is a very good vaccine.

327
00:29:57,690 --> 00:30:08,460
It's one of the few oral vaccines that exist and it works great, but rotavirus is still out there and it peaks usually in the wintertime.

328
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:11,820
Usually it starts kind of December,

329
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:19,680
January in the southwest area and kind of moves across the U.S. Although I will caveat that with COVID has disrupted all of

330
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:25,770
what I would consider usual viral transmission because everyone's seasons have become a little bit different these days.

331
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:36,960
This is the data off of the CDC. So these are the current the last three weeks of data for rotavirus.

332
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:41,099
And you can see the peak last year for the US.

333
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:48,989
This is these are March and April numbers. And so you can see kind of the springtime is usually so it's almost like a double whammy because

334
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:53,969
you'd get done with like flu season and then gastro season would come through pretty vaccine.

335
00:30:53,970 --> 00:31:00,630
So it was kind of like a double whammy. You were finally coming out of flu season, but then gastro season came around.

336
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:06,210
This information is just to kind of give you a little bit of information about rotavirus,

337
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:11,400
but the most important stuff is kind of for this for this lecture, and it's really the transmission part.

338
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:15,090
But rotavirus, the incubation period is pretty short. It's about 48 hours.

339
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:21,840
And usually they'll start with fever and then vomiting and then like a day or two later, they'll get really bad diarrhea.

340
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:24,270
That's generally how that kind of rolls.

341
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:32,459
And so the GI symptoms will usually resolve within 3 to 7 days, but the transmission is fecal oral and then on FOMITES,

342
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:39,420
so kind of surface area stuff and it actually only takes a few viral particles to actually cause disease.

343
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:43,320
So the attack rate, the secondary attack rate is pretty high.

344
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:48,739
So anywhere from 30 to 50% of adult contacts for little kids that have rotavirus.

345
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,630
So like guardians, family members,

346
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:58,589
about 30 to 50% of them will become infected because of the fact that kids will be shedding for quite some time after resolution.

347
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:06,630
And it only takes a few infectious viral particles to cause disease, no real treatment for it other than supportive oral rehydration.

348
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,780
And so kind of given that information,

349
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:16,200
what are some of the control measures we can do for the patients that are admitted in the health care system with rotavirus?

350
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:27,570
Yes. Have them in a contact precautions? Yeah, absolutely.

351
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:38,780
Anything else? Anything else you can think of? Okay.

352
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:42,810
So obviously standard precautions is the first thing, but a lot of people forget without even means.

353
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:46,100
Right. Can't be really standard if people don't understand things.

354
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:52,079
But yes, we place them in contact precautions. Obviously hand hygiene in some spaces.

355
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:56,489
If you don't have private rooms, you can do cohorting.

356
00:32:56,490 --> 00:33:04,040
So meaning that patients that if you have multiple patients have rotavirus, you can kind of stick them in the same room if you have spaces.

357
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:09,210
I will say most of the pediatric hospitals these days have private rooms, which is very nice.

358
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:13,170
Most pediatric hospitals have gotten recalled over the last several years,

359
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:19,260
and most of them have private rooms, which makes things a lot easier from a transmission perspective.

360
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:28,740
You can also we don't usually do this as much as our health care system because we're good with our precautions and the like.

361
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:33,960
But you can also cohort your staff, meaning, you know, if there's a single nurse,

362
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:37,950
there's a couple of different pediatric patients that have a virus here and there.

363
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:43,920
You can try to have one staff member be the one that's assigned to the ones that are like rotavirus positive.

364
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:50,310
So that then they're not going back and forth between healthy kids that don't have the infection versus kids that do.

365
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:57,330
I will say we don't have a lot we don't have a lot of health care transmission in our health care system.

366
00:33:57,570 --> 00:34:03,390
And so we don't really do the cohorting of staff because our precautions are really good and our hand hygiene is really good.

367
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:10,200
And so we don't have that too much. But if you're seeing an outbreak in a particular unit cohorting both of patients

368
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:13,560
in a location and staff can be a way to kind of break that transmission.

369
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:21,990
And then we actually have, like I said, we have the vaccine. So the vaccine is given as three doses and usually in the first year of life.

370
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:28,580
And so that has certainly helped a ton to get the vaccine to them.

371
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:33,810
And like, you know, I don't think so. It's only approved. So and it's actually a very specific time frame.

372
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:39,930
If you do not start the rotavirus vaccine by 15 weeks of life, then you can't give it.

373
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:46,050
And they all have to be done. I forget what the upper limit is, but I feel like they all have to be dosed in by like six months of age.

374
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:50,580
So it gets a little tricky and we'll kind of talk about it on their slide.

375
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:58,170
It gets a little tricky in the neonatal ICU about because it is a live vaccine, it's an oral vaccine, it's a live vaccine.

376
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:03,240
And as we mentioned, some of the little neonates, their immune systems aren't as great.

377
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:10,980
And so do you risk giving them a vaccine that they may or may not tolerate?

378
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:15,540
Or do you risk missing the window because you have to start it by 15 weeks?

379
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:19,050
And so that kind of gets to sometimes that is a question.

380
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:25,500
You know, we don't generally like to give live vaccines in the health care setting because the patients can shed from that perspective.

381
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:30,930
But for this one, because there is that kind of hard drop cutoff, unlike MMR and varicella,

382
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:39,390
we actually do dose it for some of those kids in the neonatal ICU and kind of keep an eye on those things because there is a pretty quick window.

383
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:45,990
So in adults generally, I mean viruses while yeah, it usually is unless you're compromised.

384
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:53,069
Yeah, I've heard a few like, you know, like grandparents or like taking care of their grandkids and then all of a sudden like

385
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:57,210
their grandkids get something and then the grandparents can get pretty sick sometimes,

386
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:03,300
but usually it's just supportive most folks don't usually require from an adult perspective.

387
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:09,990
I will tell you, though, as an adult who got rotavirus, it was a 24 hours of misery.

388
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:15,120
But as long as you stayed hydrated, it's okay. Yeah, I mean, it wasn't pretty.

389
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:20,490
And then the cleanup afterwards, not pretty. But if you're an otherwise healthy human, you should be okay.

390
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,060
Oh, I fast. Why is that window so short? I don't know.

391
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:28,530
I think it just has to do with, like, the vaccine studies and how it was kind of done because actually,

392
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:35,189
if you think about it, there is it's like all about like FDA licensure is.

393
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:39,659
My assumption of the study is that it was done. There were previous vaccines.

394
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:47,729
So currently there's it's called. I don't know the name of it, but there's a there's a a monovalent vaccine and a penta valent vaccine.

395
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:55,350
So they're one with one strain and one with five. Previously, before that, there was a vaccine called RO to shield that one.

396
00:36:55,350 --> 00:37:02,910
I do remember because it went off the market because it was linked to intussusception, which is an intestinal malformation within kids.

397
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:09,989
And so that one went off the market. And so my general sense is that when they were kind of coming to bring new ones to market, right,

398
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:13,200
you only have to do kind of the I don't want to say bare minimum,

399
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:17,669
but some of the companies will do like what they need to do to get their vaccine to market.

400
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:23,520
Right. And so they had kind of this population of patients that were the most impacted.

401
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:29,730
Right. Because most kids will get it by the age of five. And so that's where the vaccine was kind of licensed for.

402
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:35,070
And I just don't know that there's like a lot of benefit or money in it for

403
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:39,960
a company to go back and then do all those trials and all those other ones. So if you look at the code vaccine trials, right?

404
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:46,920
So the best thing about COVID is that, well, best and worst, I guess is that the public is watching science happen.

405
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:51,269
Right? Like we all understand this. We understand what's going on in the vaccine world.

406
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:55,800
We understand these different variants because that is like medicine and science we've been trained in.

407
00:37:55,950 --> 00:38:02,159
But now, like the public is kind of seeing that at play, right? So they see what vaccine trials look like and why it has to be staged.

408
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:06,780
And then you have to do this and you have to wait this many months for data and get all these approvals and things like that.

409
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:13,140
And so, you know, it's really from an R&D perspective, research and development perspective for a vaccine company.

410
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:20,459
Like if the percentage of rotavirus in adults, only 4%, like you're not going to waste your time doing a vaccine for that.

411
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:28,190
So I honestly think it comes down to just like kind of that patient cohort and they found that little niche and that's kind of what they went for.

412
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:37,290
Yeah, I seem to recall that interest perception though is this can be a severe adverse thing to natural rotavirus.

413
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:43,050
So yes, again, yeah, yeah. Because basically into perception is basically like your intestines kind of telescopes on

414
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:46,440
itself and kind of like one part of it kind of slips into the other part and it creates

415
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:50,940
all this inflammation and creates like an intestinal blockage that you then have to do

416
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:54,330
a barium and amount like blow in the air in there to like stretch out their intestines.

417
00:38:54,990 --> 00:39:02,340
But that can happen with gastroenteritis in general because you can get inflammation in your intestines in the prior patches,

418
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:12,180
and that can cause that to happen too. So yeah, because I remember when they had to withdraw, guess it was because it was a big how do yeah.

419
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:17,669
Public health yeah. Has rotavirus is not really a problem in the US in terms of yes.

420
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:20,700
Because we can because we can support it through thoroughly hydration.

421
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:27,240
Yes. But in in low and middle income countries, rotavirus kills.

422
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:29,280
Yeah. Children. Yeah.

423
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:37,830
And so then there was the issue there is the issue about this window into the delivery system and then also in terms of the cost.

424
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:43,620
Yeah, so I suspect and it's a lot vaccine, so you have to worry about cold chain and refrigeration and stuff.

425
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:47,370
So if you know, if you're interested in global health, it really is.

426
00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:55,510
It's a health equity issue. So. That's our contact you guys know about contacting.

427
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:58,770
So let me tell you about two cases of gastroenteritis in our health care system.

428
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:03,780
So speaking of rotavirus, we had a kiddo. There are two twins.

429
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:09,450
One of the siblings got discharged. The other kiddo was still in the health care system.

430
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:17,549
And the kid that was still in the hospital, like, randomly started getting a lot of diarrhea along.

431
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:23,190
That's weird. And there are clinical team tested him, and he was positive for rotavirus.

432
00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:26,280
And so then we did an investigation. We're like, ers are like help.

433
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:33,389
There was the nurse like or some of the health care workers been out recently with rotavirus and you know we call occupational health and be like,

434
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:37,590
is anyone on this floor been out with rotavirus? Is the family member sick or anything like that?

435
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:44,490
And we could not figure anything out except the Twin had gotten his vaccine earlier in the week.

436
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:49,379
And I forget what holiday it was around, but the family wanted to have like twin pictures,

437
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:55,260
so they brought the, the sibling in to visit and put them in in the I slept together and like took pictures.

438
00:40:55,260 --> 00:41:01,469
And so pretty sure that's where that came from. We didn't go as far to see if it was vaccine strain.

439
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:04,650
You can do that. You can test it to see if it's vaccine strain versus not.

440
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:08,640
We didn't not go that far, but that is one thing to consider.

441
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:14,969
We do dose as we're talking about this time. For one thing, we do dose rotavirus vaccine in our health care system.

442
00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:22,260
If you're going to miss that window and then the teams just have to be vigilant about whether or not the babies then develop diarrhea.

443
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,490
If they develop diarrhea,

444
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:32,340
then we put them in contact precautions just preemptively you will shed I think the data says about 7 to 10 days after the first vaccine.

445
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:36,690
The second vaccine, there is a little bit of shedding, but it's a shorter one third vaccine.

446
00:41:36,690 --> 00:41:43,530
There's usually not a ton of shedding after that, but something to be mindful of when you're trying to create a vaccine protocol

447
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:46,740
for your health care system because you don't want them to miss the window,

448
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:51,720
but you also don't want them to be spreading rotavirus around and the norovirus.

449
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:53,459
So this is interesting.

450
00:41:53,460 --> 00:42:00,360
And this kind of goes back to the comment that I made about how families are generally at the bedside for prolonged periods of time.

451
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:04,500
So we actually had a family. This was in the springtime.

452
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:11,729
We had somebody called infection prevention, one other health care workers called infection prevention and said,

453
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:18,750
hey, we have a mom that is at the bedside who seems to have gastroenteritis.

454
00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:27,059
She's throwing up. She's got diarrhea. She doesn't look so great, but she's refusing to leave because her kids, little ones having a lot of issues.

455
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:31,560
And there weren't any other caregivers that could come to take care of the kid and be at the bedside.

456
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:37,140
And so, you know, we have to be very mindful of that. We ought to be kicking parents out if we don't have to.

457
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:43,530
And so they were asking us, what should we do about that? And so what what would you do about that situation?

458
00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:48,690
It's not the patient, but it's the mom. If you got that phone call, what would you do?

459
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:59,770
But. I think he is.

460
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:09,300
So we decided just to preemptively put them in isolation.

461
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:13,260
So we have private rooms with private bathrooms. So that's a good thing.

462
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:17,520
We don't worry about that. And we said that mom could stay at the bedside.

463
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:22,200
But we were then just going to put mom and like just put put contact precautions

464
00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:25,830
onto that room so that when our health care workers came into the space,

465
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,210
they were being protected.

466
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:33,930
And then when environmental services was kind of coming in to the space, you know, the surfaces were getting cleaned appropriately.

467
00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:40,980
Unfortunately, we did not get notified soon enough to prevent a little mini outbreak.

468
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:49,829
And it went through a good proportion of the nursing staff on that floor and then the provider staff on that floor and then the

469
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:56,970
ICU staff on the floor below because the providers cross those two floors because this was a step down unit and then the ICU.

470
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:03,270
And so we had two units where we had lots of people with gastroenteritis.

471
00:44:04,170 --> 00:44:08,750
We had to do a lot of environmental cleaning. It was a season where there was a lot of potlucks.

472
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:13,770
You know, pre-COVID, the hospital potluck was a big thing in the break rooms.

473
00:44:14,370 --> 00:44:18,030
And so we had to be like, throw everything out. No potlucks.

474
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:21,780
If you have candy around anything that's in there, like just get rid of it.

475
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:25,590
Because, like, it's gross to think about. But it's fecal oral mainly.

476
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:29,850
So stuff some people's hands and they're putting stuff in their mouth and you know,

477
00:44:29,850 --> 00:44:33,180
so we just had to like completely clean the environment on both of those floors.

478
00:44:33,450 --> 00:44:36,990
We actually did enhanced screening for visitors coming in.

479
00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:42,450
So, you know, immediate caregivers could come and go.

480
00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:44,669
But like, you know, this is, again, pre-COVID.

481
00:44:44,670 --> 00:44:52,200
So like aunts, uncles, siblings, we actually did a screening at the front entrance of the hospital where our guest services screeners are.

482
00:44:52,440 --> 00:45:00,809
And then we had additional screeners at those two units re asking questions for people coming onto those units about GI symptoms.

483
00:45:00,810 --> 00:45:02,070
And if you had GI symptoms,

484
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:08,220
we were making you leave and we actually did additional screening for about an extra month before we could break that transmission.

485
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:15,750
Yeah. So on the like, the choice of the parent to be with their child will always outweigh.

486
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:18,980
Not always depends. It depends.

487
00:45:18,990 --> 00:45:25,360
I mean, we do have the authority if we think that they're putting other health care workers at risk and if they're not following our policies.

488
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:33,330
Oh, I meant the risk to like the patient. Oh, they're like, oh, I think it depends to depends on what organism you're talking about.

489
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:38,670
Okay. Yeah. I mean, for the most part, though, I would I would say probably.

490
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:43,320
Okay. Right. You don't want to be the person that like. Yeah. Has tells the mom they have to leave.

491
00:45:43,590 --> 00:45:47,459
But I will say in times like this, we will say you can stay.

492
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:54,810
But here are the things you need to do. You cannot leave your room. You must maintain these precautions and like things like that.

493
00:45:54,810 --> 00:46:01,440
And so we we will usually build a contract with the family member and say, here are the things that you need to do.

494
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:04,650
If you do not comply with these, then you will be asked to leave.

495
00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:09,200
And so most families are required.

496
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:16,080
Yeah. Yeah. I think at this point in most of the most situations like this, the kid has already been.

497
00:46:16,270 --> 00:46:21,090
Yeah. I mean, they've been in there for days. So by the time you figure it out, it's too late for that.

498
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:27,090
Yeah. No, because even with, you know, even even with COVID.

499
00:46:27,210 --> 00:46:34,740
Yeah. So on the pediatric side, you know, there was one patient, she was autistic.

500
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:41,200
And the nursing staff, like with her with her dad, it was the dad that was there.

501
00:46:41,610 --> 00:46:45,599
The nursing staff just could not keep her calm like dad needed to be there because,

502
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:52,320
like the environment was just overstimulating for her and the nursing staff was trying their best, but they could not keep her calm.

503
00:46:52,770 --> 00:46:58,410
And dad got COVID and we allowed him to stay.

504
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:05,190
I mean, obviously, we explained risk benefit of the fact that, you know, he could be transmitting to her, but he accepted that risk.

505
00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:09,450
And the fact that, you know, like this is what his child needed for for them.

506
00:47:09,450 --> 00:47:12,839
But he stayed in his room. He wore a mask. He, like, did all the things.

507
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:18,419
And we kind of checked, marked all those things off. And she actually never got sick from that perspective.

508
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:24,310
But it kind of depends, right? So like, would I say, like, I'm going to let a mom with Ebola room with her kid?

509
00:47:24,350 --> 00:47:26,819
No, probably not. Probably not. Probably. Probably not.

510
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:34,049
But but you know, for like for at least with COVID, knock on wood, earlier strains were a little rough on the kids.

511
00:47:34,050 --> 00:47:37,620
But like right now, the Omaha strain is, you know, most of the kids fare pretty well.

512
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:41,279
So it kind of just depends. It really is a patient a patient kind of decision.

513
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:48,180
But you have to weigh all those other factors like the nursing staff take care of this kid sufficiently without their family members by their.

514
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:51,930
Is there something that's going to come up soon where this child might pass away

515
00:47:51,930 --> 00:47:55,260
or have a significant morbidity and mortality and the family needs to be there?

516
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:59,190
You know, those are all kind of things that we we factor in on a regular basis.

517
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:07,480
Good question. Okay. I only got, like, 15 minutes left, so let's just go.

518
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:11,080
Okay. So respiratory viruses, what have these real quick respiratory viruses?

519
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:18,400
This again, pre-pandemic numbers, about 500 million non influenza viral respiratory infections per year.

520
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:23,799
I see kids all the time in clinic for immune evaluations because they are sick all the time and their parents are like,

521
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:30,760
how are they sick all the time? And actually, preschool age kids, toddlers, daycare kids, they can have anywhere from 5 to 7.

522
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:35,589
Some people would say 8 to 10 viral infections a year and still have a completely normal,

523
00:48:35,590 --> 00:48:40,780
healthy immune system because they're just learning to be educated. Their immune system is getting educated to these viruses.

524
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:43,930
And so these infections can last 10 to 14 days.

525
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:51,940
So, yes, if you get seven, eight, ten infections a year and they're lasting 10 to 14 days in a kid, you know, your kid's sick all the time.

526
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:58,750
If any of you guys have kids in daycare or school. My my coworker, her son is two and a half.

527
00:48:58,750 --> 00:49:05,320
And I don't think in his entire life that I've met him, I've never seen him without a snotty runny nose like the kid is sick all the time.

528
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:08,980
And anytime I see her, she's like, Oh, don't worry, that cough has been there for a while.

529
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:15,460
He's like, Okay. I mean, man has I could not had a runny nose in the last two years, so the kid's going to be sick all the time,

530
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:24,310
which then just means that there are little viral spreaders, which is what is the important part of this talk, obviously, from the CDC.

531
00:49:24,310 --> 00:49:30,280
So the National Respiratory and Enteric Bias Surveillance system, so they kind of monitor all of these different viruses.

532
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:33,640
And so that's where some of the data. So RSV, let's talk about RSV.

533
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:36,970
So sorry, I'm going to go pretty fast so I don't run out of time.

534
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:44,680
So RSV is the most common cause of bronchiolitis and currently we're having what the media has now called a triple damage.

535
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:55,150
I think people have short term memories. They forget that it is RSV season and the last two years as a side effect of the pandemic and mask wearing.

536
00:49:55,390 --> 00:50:00,910
RSV basically went away and so I think people forget that RSV can be real bad.

537
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:07,270
I will say the numbers are pretty high this year and it is about a month or so earlier than usual.

538
00:50:07,330 --> 00:50:13,210
COVID is also again messing up that transmission, but it can be bad, particularly for kids under a year of age.

539
00:50:13,330 --> 00:50:18,130
So RSV is biggest issue is it creates a lot of snot and mucus and inflames your airways.

540
00:50:18,490 --> 00:50:24,730
And so little kids who have little airways have inflammation in their airways, have a lot of snot and mucus, and then they just can't breathe.

541
00:50:24,850 --> 00:50:27,900
And that's what brings them into the hospital is oxygen needs and breathing problems.

542
00:50:30,370 --> 00:50:38,609
And most years it can cause about 2% of kids up to 2% with RSV will require hospitalization a little bit higher this year.

543
00:50:38,610 --> 00:50:44,139
It seems so annual, but so adults can get it to some healthy elderly.

544
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:48,850
About 3 to 4% every year will have RSV infections in the higher risk group.

545
00:50:48,850 --> 00:50:55,690
Like the immunocompromised patients, they'll have about 4 to 10% and they can have a comparable length of stay of influenza and

546
00:50:55,690 --> 00:50:59,470
actually sometimes longer because the oxygen requirement can actually last a pretty long time,

547
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:02,290
to the point that a lot of kids actually, at least on the pediatric side,

548
00:51:02,290 --> 00:51:06,460
might go home with supplemental oxygen so we can just get them out of the hospital.

549
00:51:08,330 --> 00:51:15,080
So this is what it usually looks like again. So this is older data, but it used to kind of start if we see like December, January,

550
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:21,469
February and we kind of start around we used to start giving synergistic television AB at the beginning

551
00:51:21,470 --> 00:51:26,240
of December and then your numbers would start kind of kicking up December like late December,

552
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:29,330
January, February, like as influenza season was starting to wane.

553
00:51:29,570 --> 00:51:37,580
Our species and we're kind of come up that has completely been tossed out the window with COVID because I don't know, the virus has got all confused.

554
00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:44,030
Last year we had a whole bunch of cases in August and then it kind of dipped down and then it came back again in September.

555
00:51:44,030 --> 00:51:47,120
And now this year we're having high numbers here in October.

556
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:50,720
So I don't know what's going to happen once,

557
00:51:51,410 --> 00:52:00,200
once kind of COVID stuff kind of settles down a little bit more of these usual viral seasons will, well, stay or not stay.

558
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:04,069
So this is the data from from the CDC.

559
00:52:04,070 --> 00:52:09,530
And you can see last year these data this is actually from like the summer of last year.

560
00:52:09,530 --> 00:52:12,799
I don't know if you guys remember like hearing on the news last year,

561
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:18,290
but it was like a huge thing in like June, July, August, where we were seeing winter like numbers of RSV.

562
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:23,930
And that's because that was the it was in the summer of 2021, so not this past summer, but last summer.

563
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:28,940
And that's because, you know, that was the summer of freedom, right?

564
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:34,429
Because COVID had gone away and everyone took their masks off. And so those other viruses were just waiting for us.

565
00:52:34,430 --> 00:52:39,170
They're just waiting for us to do that. And so we had huge numbers over the summertime last year.

566
00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:43,010
The blue is our antigen detections and the purple.

567
00:52:43,010 --> 00:52:47,570
Our PCR detections are just the two different ways to look at things, and these are the national numbers.

568
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:51,230
And then they kind of came down and then we had a little blip, a little tiny blip this summer.

569
00:52:51,470 --> 00:53:01,090
But now we are skyrocketing for this winter. So the most important part about RSV is the incubation periods, about 4 to 6 days,

570
00:53:01,090 --> 00:53:04,960
but can ranged about two symptoms, usually resolved within 1 to 2 weeks.

571
00:53:05,710 --> 00:53:11,020
And usually most people will shed from 3 to 5 days when you can shed up to about four weeks,

572
00:53:11,950 --> 00:53:18,909
you're most contagious from days, about 3 to 5 droplet transmission and again, high transmissibility.

573
00:53:18,910 --> 00:53:23,500
So similar to rotavirus. About 50% of household members will become infected.

574
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:27,549
With regards to if they're exposed to other people in their health care system,

575
00:53:27,550 --> 00:53:31,030
which is why these numbers are probably so high because a lot of siblings are getting sick as well.

576
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:37,570
Treatment is supportive, and primary infection, unlike some of the other things, does not provide lifelong immunity.

577
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:45,700
There are usually two different types that kind of circulate, usually one predominates per year, but you can get RSV multiple times in a season.

578
00:53:47,770 --> 00:53:57,400
Para influenza. There's four of them. Primarily, it causes croup and bronchiolitis and pneumonia and your eye type symptoms.

579
00:53:57,910 --> 00:54:03,700
Pair of flu three can actually cause aseptic meningitis in some patient populations.

580
00:54:04,390 --> 00:54:12,340
Again, this is pretty ubiquitous in the pediatric population, with most people having had seropositivity by the time of their five years of age.

581
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:19,680
Again, pre-pandemic paraphilia one and two would cycle every other year on off years.

582
00:54:20,050 --> 00:54:24,400
Peripherally one used to be odd number of years and then paraphilia two would be an even number of years.

583
00:54:25,150 --> 00:54:30,309
Pair of flu three pretty much circulates every single year, but primarily in the spring,

584
00:54:30,310 --> 00:54:33,340
in the summer and paraphilia four just kind of trickles around.

585
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:36,550
There's not a lot of data about its seasonality.

586
00:54:37,420 --> 00:54:40,840
Again, this is the data from from the CDC.

587
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:49,090
So this is Theraflu one. And you can kind of see mainly if you look so as that kind of creeps up this one and then starts to come down

588
00:54:49,090 --> 00:54:54,130
and this one kind of comes down this pair for two and then pair of flu three is just kind of all over the map.

589
00:54:55,600 --> 00:55:02,590
So definitely ones circulating out there. Again, incubation period, about 2 to 7 days shedding of the symptoms.

590
00:55:03,220 --> 00:55:10,420
You can actually shed symptoms like influenza. You can start shedding up to a week before symptoms flare.

591
00:55:10,450 --> 00:55:13,599
You can shed a few days before symptoms as similar as COVID.

592
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:17,620
Right. So that makes it tricky because then person looks fine, but they're not fine.

593
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:22,389
Again, you can have weeks worth of shedding even after your symptoms.

594
00:55:22,390 --> 00:55:25,750
Resolve. Transmission is both respiratory droplets and fomites.

595
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:29,410
Again, supportive therapy. And you can get.

596
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:33,190
There's not a lot of cross-protection between the different types.

597
00:55:33,190 --> 00:55:37,299
So I had one patient on a pair of flu three last months, got pair flu for this month.

598
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:44,380
And so unfortunately you don't kind of get a lot of cross-protection, so it can kind of keep perpetuating itself.

599
00:55:45,670 --> 00:55:52,209
And then human metahuman virus, so human that are numerous initially this kind of given its name or discovered, if you will, in 2001.

600
00:55:52,210 --> 00:55:54,340
But we believe it's been around probably since the fifties,

601
00:55:54,970 --> 00:56:01,090
very similar to RSV in the fact that it causes that bronchiolitis type picture where it causes a lot of airway swelling

602
00:56:01,090 --> 00:56:07,870
and a lot of secretions and the children and older adults get infected more than usual kind of mid range adult.

603
00:56:08,710 --> 00:56:14,710
And usually the kids under one are the ones that are most impacted, similar to all the other ones.

604
00:56:14,710 --> 00:56:17,040
Most kids are infected by five years of age,

605
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:21,790
which is why our adult population doesn't have a lot of issues because we should have antibodies by the time

606
00:56:21,790 --> 00:56:30,010
you're an adult and kids can require hospitalization with about 4 to 6% of them having human motor pneumo virus.

607
00:56:32,350 --> 00:56:36,459
This one's a little messy. Ignore the blue part because those are the ancient ones.

608
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:43,180
But if you can see more of the peak kind of here on the purple, so it kind of follows the same time period as ours becomes a little bit earlier.

609
00:56:44,110 --> 00:56:49,050
This is October of last year into November, and then it kind of came down.

610
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:53,680
So basically, although although the media is trying to be scary about the triple.

611
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:57,229
DIMOCK Pretty much, you know, respiratory season is respiratory season.

612
00:56:57,230 --> 00:56:59,710
And there's all kinds of things out there that can get us.

613
00:57:01,660 --> 00:57:09,250
So human melanoma virus again, similar to the other ones incubation period, about 3 to 5 days viral shedding can be prolonged,

614
00:57:09,250 --> 00:57:17,140
similar to the other ones, we believe it's respiratory droplet fomites and larger kind of aerosolized particles.

615
00:57:17,830 --> 00:57:23,559
And again, supportive therapy. So preventative measures for respiratory viruses.

616
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:27,850
What do we do for the kiddos that are admitted with respiratory viruses?

617
00:57:28,330 --> 00:57:32,230
Yes. Yes. What else? Yes.

618
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:42,050
And Corey. Yeah. So we have really standard precautions, droplet precautions, hand hygiene, cohorting in private rooms, as we talked about before.

619
00:57:43,850 --> 00:57:48,440
Not for the patients that have the infections, but for our immunocompromised patients.

620
00:57:48,710 --> 00:57:54,680
We also use something called protective environment. So like our bone marrow transplant patients or solid organ transplant patients,

621
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:58,580
we put them in protective environment rooms which are positive pressure rooms.

622
00:57:58,970 --> 00:58:04,520
So kind of blows air out, has the air curtain where it's pushing air out to try to prevent stuff from coming into their rooms.

623
00:58:05,150 --> 00:58:09,080
So that is helpful for respiratory viruses. Waiting room restrictions.

624
00:58:09,170 --> 00:58:13,070
So on the pediatric side, I don't know if they do this on the adult side,

625
00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:19,010
but on the pediatric side during respiratory season and then maybe throughout the other part of the year,

626
00:58:19,010 --> 00:58:21,649
now that covid's around, you know, a COVID,

627
00:58:21,650 --> 00:58:29,270
we kind of separated well and sick in the waiting rooms like that was something that PE patient Pete's primary care physicians kind of always did.

628
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:31,010
So during respiratory season,

629
00:58:31,010 --> 00:58:37,490
what they would try to do is they would do like well-child visits in the morning and then they take sick visits for the afternoon.

630
00:58:37,790 --> 00:58:41,510
So the night the newborn baby that's coming in for their well-child check for a wait,

631
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:44,900
like they're not sitting in the same room with someone that has a respiratory virus.

632
00:58:44,910 --> 00:58:46,580
So they would do all of their, well,

633
00:58:46,580 --> 00:58:53,840
patient visits in the morning and then they'd start getting those people out of the waiting room and bring in their sick visits for the afternoon.

634
00:58:54,140 --> 00:58:59,340
And then they kind of clean their office space in the evening so that the next day it's clean for when the new kids come in.

635
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:05,000
So just another way of kind of traffic flow that you can kind of keep those patients from intermingling in the same space.

636
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:14,840
Obviously, work restrictions. Everyone knows about that during COVID times and then limiting visitors if you have to also for droplet precautions.

637
00:59:15,770 --> 00:59:21,200
So we make sure that patients do not spend time in other patients rooms,

638
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:27,710
which can be challenging on the pediatric side because everyone likes to be friends and we keep them out of the common spaces.

639
00:59:28,730 --> 00:59:33,530
They can kind of move around the hallway if that's part of their care, like for physical therapy.

640
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:37,130
Or they can go in the courtyards where they have to have like a clean mask on.

641
00:59:38,210 --> 00:59:42,800
If they have to be transported. We make sure that they have a mask on and a clean gown.

642
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:48,290
And outside of the primary caregivers, if there's people with respiratory symptoms,

643
00:59:48,290 --> 00:59:52,820
they're not allowed to visit unless it's absolutely approved by the care team.

644
00:59:54,350 --> 01:00:00,110
So basically the summary for transmission of respiratory virus is obviously we have inhalation of the small droplet particles,

645
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:06,090
we have hand contact with surfaces, your own secretions, other people's secretions and kind of cross-referencing there.

646
01:00:06,110 --> 01:00:07,670
So hand hygiene is really important.

647
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:14,990
And then obviously we use a lot of face shields with the droplet precautions so that the direct contact of the large droplet,

648
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:19,760
when people are sneezing and things like that, do not get into your mucous membranes.

649
01:00:20,870 --> 01:00:24,050
Okay. One last one. So and no virus.

650
01:00:24,380 --> 01:00:28,430
I put this at the end because it's both a respiratory virus, entity virus.

651
01:00:28,820 --> 01:00:33,530
So a combination of both. There are actually probably over 100 people keep forgetting the changes.

652
01:00:33,830 --> 01:00:35,479
There's over 100 serotypes at this point.

653
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:43,820
But we primarily see respiratory issues with three, seven, 14 and 21 and GI issues with 40 and 41 serotype number.

654
01:00:44,330 --> 01:00:50,360
But they can happen with pretty much all of them. Most patients will have been infected by the age of ten.

655
01:00:51,050 --> 01:00:58,430
We see some pharyngeal conjunctivitis, so like sore throats and like pinkeye type symptoms in the summer times around campus.

656
01:00:58,430 --> 01:01:04,219
And you can get a lot of carrier conjunctivitis or like an eye infections in

657
01:01:04,220 --> 01:01:07,610
medical facilities if they're not cleaning like the eye equipment well enough.

658
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:14,870
And it does account for up to 10% of all children's respiratory infections and obviously nosocomial spread can happen.

659
01:01:15,620 --> 01:01:19,849
Again, this is kind of a trend, although it seems pretty if you focus more on the pink line.

660
01:01:19,850 --> 01:01:25,009
The PCR based testing is what most hospitals use these days as pretty consistently

661
01:01:25,010 --> 01:01:28,640
throughout the year from October of last year to October of this year.

662
01:01:29,990 --> 01:01:34,070
Respiratory incubation, about 2 to 14 days year, shorter 3 to 10.

663
01:01:34,790 --> 01:01:37,969
You can get sore throat, runny nose, croup like things.

664
01:01:37,970 --> 01:01:40,670
You get real bad pinkeye or conjunctivitis.

665
01:01:41,450 --> 01:01:47,810
The symptoms usually last for about a week, but can up to two weeks and you can get secondary bacterial infections.

666
01:01:48,470 --> 01:01:53,540
And similar to some of the other viruses, it doesn't take a lot of viral particles to make you sick.

667
01:01:53,540 --> 01:01:56,180
So you have to be very cautious with your hand hygiene.

668
01:01:56,240 --> 01:02:03,959
And usually you're infectious during the first couple of days, but you can have asymptomatic shedding for months to years.

669
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:15,230
So some immunocompromised patients, some of our bone marrow transplant patients can shed or be asymptomatically positive for up to up years or two.

670
01:02:16,190 --> 01:02:23,560
From that perspective, just with like low level viremia, our transmission is droplet fomite and fecal oral supportive care.

671
01:02:23,570 --> 01:02:32,810
There is one antiviral you can use if you're immunocompromised, but for the most population it's just supportive and reinfections can occur.

672
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:37,270
So. Pre-pandemic. In 2018.

673
01:02:38,140 --> 01:02:44,560
I know you guys probably weren't health care associated minded enough in 2018 to pay attention to this,

674
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:54,850
but there were huge outbreaks in New Jersey of Adeno virus and a couple of long term health care facilities in New Jersey, including a pediatric one.

675
01:02:55,300 --> 01:02:59,170
It was almost like a nursing home for pediatric patients, which there aren't a ton of those around.

676
01:02:59,170 --> 01:03:08,560
But and we got there's tons of press. So there are a lot of cases of animal virus in the pediatric facilities and their health department

677
01:03:08,950 --> 01:03:13,090
had to launch a huge the state health department in New Jersey had to launch a huge investigation.

678
01:03:13,330 --> 01:03:14,950
But, of course, it made it to the press.

679
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:21,429
And if you haven't learned one thing yet, you will realize that the press becomes a problem as a hospital epidemiologist,

680
01:03:21,430 --> 01:03:26,620
because they will paint pictures in ways that scare people sometimes when they're trying to be informative.

681
01:03:27,310 --> 01:03:34,480
And so around this time, I actually got a call from someone on campus here because there is a patient that was coming

682
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:39,460
back from New Jersey who happened to have had no virus and happened to be living in the dorms.

683
01:03:39,730 --> 01:03:46,000
And they were then asking me kind of what should they do from a precautions perspective?

684
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:49,650
Because obviously everyone was like super worried about what was going on there.

685
01:03:49,660 --> 01:03:55,540
So. So even even as a hospital epidemiologist at the health care center, you know, we obviously kind of liaison with campus a lot.

686
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:59,019
And particularly if there's like some pediatric things, we kind of get tapped in.

687
01:03:59,020 --> 01:04:02,360
So something you'll have to be mindful of from that perspective.

688
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:07,000
So that patient ended up being fine and we had no problems in the dorms, but.

689
01:04:08,140 --> 01:04:11,680
Okay, so quick story about what happens and alarms in our health care system.

690
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:18,370
So we had a case. The first case is 13 month old with biliary atresia, which is a liver disease that is post liver transplant.

691
01:04:18,790 --> 01:04:25,540
Had been in our hospital for a real long time because of their chronic lung disease and they had four days of emesis and diarrhea, but no fever.

692
01:04:25,540 --> 01:04:28,959
And then they had this rash, took them a while to kind of figure things out.

693
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:33,850
And they finally did a stool test that showed that they had adenovirus and improve without any interventions.

694
01:04:34,030 --> 01:04:40,120
And this is our hallway and that's their room. And then a couple of days later, as this patient was getting better,

695
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:45,550
an eight month old premature, also been in the hospital forever, had two days of fever.

696
01:04:45,580 --> 01:04:51,640
I mean, two days of emesis and diarrhea, no fever. And they, too, were positive and their room was out next to each other.

697
01:04:52,570 --> 01:04:57,580
And then a few days later, we had a third case, a five month old also.

698
01:04:57,580 --> 01:05:01,270
This is this wasn't like in our room or stable unit.

699
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:07,509
So a lot of the kids are there for a really long time, had a couple of days of vomiting and diarrhea, a few days fever.

700
01:05:07,510 --> 01:05:13,899
And this person also had not only in their stool but also in their blood, but all of them got better.

701
01:05:13,900 --> 01:05:18,520
But they were right across the hall from each other. So, of course, the staff on the you know, it's like, whoa, what's happening here?

702
01:05:19,330 --> 01:05:22,809
And we never really found like a smoking gun.

703
01:05:22,810 --> 01:05:27,370
You generally don't. Unfortunately, sometimes our outbreak investigations are very unsatisfying,

704
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:36,820
but we imagine that there's either shared equipment or, you know, shared nursing staff cross covering same nursing techs.

705
01:05:37,450 --> 01:05:43,630
Luckily, after those three, we didn't have any more cases. But, you know, something that was kind of a real life example.

706
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:52,360
So respiratory virus program. So back before COVID to actually one of our infection prevention is Jackie White.

707
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:54,759
I think she might have already talked to you guys. Yeah. Yeah.

708
01:05:54,760 --> 01:06:01,299
So she used to run this respiratory virus protection program where she would like look at every health care associated,

709
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:05,680
respiratory infection on the pediatric side and assess for ill family members,

710
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:14,440
ill staff members, any kind of, you know, travel off the unit kind of are basic like kind of investigation that we do now on COVID.

711
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:18,880
But this was kind of like a novel thing back then. Like people didn't really pay much attention to these respiratory viruses.

712
01:06:19,570 --> 01:06:26,080
And she found unfortunately, like most of the time, we didn't really know, but for the most part it was usually a sick family member.

713
01:06:26,830 --> 01:06:34,299
From that perspective, again, mask wearing, not a huge thing back when she was doing this, I think it was 2000 to 2009 from that perspective.

714
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:40,690
Now we do contact tracing all the time and it's kind of a mainstream type thing, but like she kind of revolutionized that from back in the day.

715
01:06:40,930 --> 01:06:46,630
And the last thing I want to say about occupational health, so your health care providers, as I mentioned earlier,

716
01:06:46,810 --> 01:06:50,800
working with pediatric patients, are going to have very different interactions than what they do with adults.

717
01:06:51,190 --> 01:06:56,019
And so the kids have a higher incidence or greater number of infections.

718
01:06:56,020 --> 01:07:02,140
So that increases your health care workers risk because they're being exposed to more things than they would on kind of the usual adult unit.

719
01:07:03,310 --> 01:07:06,129
The staff may be more susceptible to childhood illnesses.

720
01:07:06,130 --> 01:07:12,790
So as I mentioned, most of these like pediatric infections you have before the time that you're like 5 to 10 years of age.

721
01:07:12,790 --> 01:07:18,460
Right. And so as you get older, your antibodies kind of start to wane over time, they start to drop off.

722
01:07:18,790 --> 01:07:23,799
And so it happens the same thing. Like that's why all of us got sick when we first went in a pediatric residency.

723
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:29,890
Your first year of pediatric residency is horrible. You pick up every virus that you like or like, what is this like?

724
01:07:29,890 --> 01:07:33,340
What is happening here? Because you're exposed to all these kids and you just need your immune.

725
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:35,920
System rebooted. I tell you now, knock on wood.

726
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:41,100
I hardly ever get sick now because I think I get daily doses of exposure when I walk into the hospital every day.

727
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:44,550
But if you think about teachers, you think about first time parents now.

728
01:07:44,580 --> 01:07:48,630
My friend's kid had him put in mouth a couple of years ago and he was like, What is this?

729
01:07:48,660 --> 01:07:51,900
This is the worst thing ever, because he got it. He was like, Good Lord.

730
01:07:52,110 --> 01:07:55,270
And I was like, Yeah, yeah. Welcome. Welcome to the world of childhood illnesses.

731
01:07:55,290 --> 01:07:58,439
So as you get older, your antibody protections wane over time.

732
01:07:58,440 --> 01:08:01,710
So if you are coming into the pediatric health care population,

733
01:08:01,980 --> 01:08:05,190
you're going to be a little bit more exposed to things you might not have protection to.

734
01:08:06,150 --> 01:08:09,600
Obviously, I have close contacts with our health care workers and our pediatric patients.

735
01:08:09,780 --> 01:08:16,470
Not only are kids super friendly and they want to be cared for, but like some of our caregivers, some of your guardians can't be there all the time.

736
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:22,680
They have to work. They have other kids at home, like in their kids. But patients are left without their parents or guardians.

737
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:28,259
And so we have attendants, we have volunteers, we have, you know, nursing staff that are like become their families.

738
01:08:28,260 --> 01:08:35,910
And so, you know, there's a lot more close interaction with the kids on the pediatric side than as opposed to with the patients on the adult side.

739
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:41,820
As I mentioned, kids can also be asymptomatic spreaders in a shelter so they can look fine,

740
01:08:42,060 --> 01:08:45,930
but they can still be shedding these viruses and their different secretions,

741
01:08:46,170 --> 01:08:50,040
which makes it a little bit more challenging because we say you can come out of contact

742
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:54,060
precautions and come out of respiratory precautions once your symptoms resolve.

743
01:08:54,360 --> 01:08:58,920
But if you're still having close contact with these kids and you're not doing good hand hygiene and things,

744
01:08:59,220 --> 01:09:03,840
you're still at risk for them because they are potentially doing asymptomatic setting.

745
01:09:04,470 --> 01:09:08,100
As we mentioned before, they don't have good respiratory etiquette.

746
01:09:09,030 --> 01:09:14,940
And then obviously we also mentioned previously that you're not only potentially exposed to your patient,

747
01:09:15,210 --> 01:09:19,500
but you're also potentially exposed to sick family members that are coming in because they stay long term.

748
01:09:19,530 --> 01:09:23,880
So those are the main differences. And just the fact of pediatrics is one.

749
01:09:25,180 --> 01:09:30,130
It's good. It's good. There are way more fun. So questions.

750
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:40,430
Sorry. That last little bit was fast. Questions.

751
01:09:40,430 --> 01:09:43,850
Concerns. Yes.

752
01:09:43,860 --> 01:09:48,390
Oh, sorry. Yeah. This cover. Mm. Huh. I work with the wastewater.

753
01:09:48,660 --> 01:09:52,980
Oh, yeah. So I'm curious for childhood infections. Does that.

754
01:09:55,230 --> 01:09:59,160
Like stool or feces, like make it to the wastewater treatment.

755
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:03,170
They're usually in diapers. Oh, that's a good question.

756
01:10:03,470 --> 01:10:06,500
Probably not. I've never done landfill.

757
01:10:06,530 --> 01:10:10,700
Yeah, I was going to say. I know, because that's that's a great question. I've never thought of that.

758
01:10:10,700 --> 01:10:16,900
But no, I'd imagine it doesn't because like most of those diapers would just get packaged up and thrown away in the garbage, so.

759
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:21,889
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. As they're older, you can actually.

760
01:10:21,890 --> 01:10:24,920
If they're not smashed into the diaper. Yeah. But yeah.

761
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:28,999
But I would say nursing staff is not or, or parents are not like stupid stuff in there, so.

762
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,729
Yeah. Yeah. That's a great question. No. Yeah.

763
01:10:31,730 --> 01:10:37,760
So probably what most kids start getting potty training three or four or five years of age, you know, like three or four or five,

764
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:43,480
depending on how how aggressive how aggressive family man is was not potty trained until she was five.

765
01:10:43,490 --> 01:10:46,490
She's a slow starter but. So, yeah.

766
01:10:46,490 --> 01:10:52,240
So yeah, there's a, there's a wide range and it's not because they're not intelligence because they don't want to do it.

767
01:10:52,250 --> 01:10:56,389
Yeah. They got better things to do, like watch, like Bluey and stuff.

768
01:10:56,390 --> 01:11:01,310
I don't have time to go to the bathroom, but he is great. It's a great show, right?

769
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:09,080
I don't like it. I mean, who knew the Australian like Public Public Service Group show.

770
01:11:09,890 --> 01:11:14,150
Yeah, yeah. Oh, I love doing background fires.

771
01:11:14,150 --> 01:11:19,280
Like I had a diaper service with my oldest who is now 37.

772
01:11:19,700 --> 01:11:24,860
So that all went in. Oh, yeah, that's fantastic. Yeah, I think most people now use it both.

773
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:30,290
Yeah, yeah. So, but, but I mean, if you, if you catch em early when they Yeah.

774
01:11:30,470 --> 01:11:35,960
When they're being potty trained, you don't have a form story for them, but you got to.

775
01:11:36,870 --> 01:11:42,890
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I was curious because like, I think I've asked, you know, Brazil, it's like, oh yeah, super, super bad.

776
01:11:43,550 --> 01:11:46,970
But now we're seeing it. Yeah. It's not correlating with all that noise.

777
01:11:46,970 --> 01:11:52,930
Well yeah. Well I imagine though I imagine they are getting it.

778
01:11:53,150 --> 01:12:00,440
I'm just not getting Yeah. Just not getting tested or hospitalized because I imagine if you're a parent and you have so if your kid is.

779
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:09,200
RC Yeah. Okay, so little story. My lovely niece Avery, the Thanksgiving before pandemic decided to get herself admitted for RSV.

780
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:15,179
The day I was flying home for Thanksgiving, God bless her. And so I like literally like got off the plane.

781
01:12:15,180 --> 01:12:20,780
I went to the hospital to see my niece and she got discharged just a day later, like she just needed like a little whiff of respiratory stuff.

782
01:12:21,020 --> 01:12:27,559
And I wore my mask the entire time I was in her house because I was like, entry got things to do.

783
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:33,950
She doesn't need any RSV. And literally I was sitting at like they have a very long dining room table and one day I'm sitting

784
01:12:33,950 --> 01:12:38,980
there and she sneezes and you could feel the what I'm like girl like there was like six feet,

785
01:12:38,990 --> 01:12:43,459
like, what are you doing? So I got sick as a dog about a week later, but it was just a cold for me.

786
01:12:43,460 --> 01:12:46,490
Like, it was just like super bad, like sinus congestion and stuff.

787
01:12:46,700 --> 01:12:51,109
So I imagine that adults are getting it just as Emily saying, not getting hospitalized.

788
01:12:51,110 --> 01:12:55,340
And so that's probably a driver of what's putting it into the system there.

789
01:12:55,350 --> 01:12:58,760
Probably lots of other family members getting sick, just not getting hospitalized.

790
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:02,930
But I looked at our data yesterday because the the media requests keep coming in,

791
01:13:03,590 --> 01:13:07,730
and I think we're already up to well, the data was probably it's a little delayed.

792
01:13:08,030 --> 01:13:11,839
I think we've already had like 109 hospitalizations for RSV.

793
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:14,300
And like usually around this year it's like 60.

794
01:13:14,690 --> 01:13:20,180
They're projecting us to be up to like 150 by the end of them, like in the next like month time period.

795
01:13:21,350 --> 01:13:25,430
And so it's probably just the, the other adult folks that are just not as sick.

796
01:13:26,330 --> 01:13:30,979
Yeah. Because the kids are get admitted are the little kids. And that's just like I said, because their airways get swollen.

797
01:13:30,980 --> 01:13:34,100
They have a lot of mucus, a lot of issues for the little, little kids.

798
01:13:34,310 --> 01:13:41,360
They might not even need oxygen. They just can't eat because like little if you think a little babies in their teeny tiny little

799
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:46,070
noses and like like you can't stick a bottle in their mouth and then expect them to breathe.

800
01:13:46,220 --> 01:13:50,000
Right. They just can't do it right because their their nasal passages are too small.

801
01:13:50,270 --> 01:13:56,360
So they're either admitted because they need oxygen or they're admitted because they can't eat and then they like their glucose is get low,

802
01:13:56,360 --> 01:13:57,620
they get to really dehydrated.

803
01:13:58,220 --> 01:14:03,950
And it's all just because, you know, babies are usually mouth breathers, primarily until their nasal passages get bigger.

804
01:14:04,190 --> 01:14:07,400
So if every couple of hours you're, like blocking that off to try to feed them,

805
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:11,750
they're going to stop wanting to eat because they're they can't breathe.

806
01:14:12,620 --> 01:14:15,770
And so that's that's mainly why they're getting admitted.

807
01:14:16,190 --> 01:14:23,180
It just keeps people wandering. There are a lot of respiratory infections, including influenza, where you do get viral particles in the stool.

808
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:30,600
Yes. Yeah. So it's even though you think of them in the airways and that's the transmission system.

809
01:14:30,650 --> 01:14:34,340
Yeah. But you you will get viral particles. I mean, think of like, right.

810
01:14:34,340 --> 01:14:37,550
I mean, polio is caused by enterovirus, which is right here.

811
01:14:37,580 --> 01:14:40,700
Yeah. And polio also can be respiratory, right. So.

812
01:14:40,700 --> 01:14:50,389
Well, and if you think of the huge outbreak of enterovirus D68 in late 2014, all those kids were coming in with like respiratory infections.

813
01:14:50,390 --> 01:14:55,370
And about a week later, they were coming in with paralysis, like like they couldn't use their arms and legs.

814
01:14:56,120 --> 01:15:00,280
But that's all kind of in the same family. And actually a lot of the kids we actually detected it on to.

815
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:04,499
Testing as opposed to respiratory testing or even like CSF testing.

816
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:07,760
So there's more in the stool. Mm hmm. Yeah.

817
01:15:07,770 --> 01:15:12,430
And of course, it ends up with. Yeah. So I'll.

818
01:15:12,550 --> 01:15:16,980
I'll leave Betsy and Emily with my other slide presentation about a day in the life.

819
01:15:17,220 --> 01:15:23,400
You guys can maybe do that sometime later, but it's about the Lego guy because, you know, you ain't got Lego guys in the adult world.

820
01:15:23,670 --> 01:15:30,210
Yeah, it's about the Lego guy that comes in our hospital and how perhaps his cleaning protocols were not so sufficient when he first came around.

821
01:15:30,690 --> 01:15:35,069
Yeah. So they are posted. You can look at. Yeah.

822
01:15:35,070 --> 01:15:40,590
And there's a link. I actually was like literally rounding. So our infection prevention people hate when we round hate when me,

823
01:15:40,590 --> 01:15:45,719
Emily and Lorraine's coming next when we round because we start texting and emailing and be like, guys, I saw this guys.

824
01:15:45,720 --> 01:15:49,080
I saw this the other day. I was snapping pictures of a construction barrier in this.

825
01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:52,050
And like the emergency room when I was down there and I was sending it to Kevin,

826
01:15:52,260 --> 01:15:56,070
our infection prevention is and I'm like, Kevin, could you look at this? This doesn't look right.

827
01:15:56,250 --> 01:15:59,219
And so they hate when we're on the floors because then we start looking at things.

828
01:15:59,220 --> 01:16:04,560
My sister says I am like a killjoy because I look at things and I think of like a dangers on a playground.

829
01:16:04,740 --> 01:16:09,330
I don't let my niece in a sandbox because who knows what's pooping in there, what kind of parasites you can get.

830
01:16:09,540 --> 01:16:13,170
And then you walk around with this mindset of like infection prevention and safety, right?

831
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:17,580
Just warn yourselves. Entering an interesting world, you'll definitely see the world in a different light.

832
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:19,049
And so we snap all these pictures.

833
01:16:19,050 --> 01:16:25,890
And one day I was getting ready and putting my precautions on and I was going into a contact precautions room and there's a Lego guy there.

834
01:16:26,790 --> 01:16:30,689
And I was like, Oh, that's really cool. I was like, Do they all get to keep their projects?

835
01:16:30,690 --> 01:16:33,059
And he kind of looked a little frightened because I guess they're real expensive and they

836
01:16:33,060 --> 01:16:36,930
don't get to keep their projects because it's like this weird electric thing that he does.

837
01:16:36,930 --> 01:16:42,540
Like they build like Lego robots, but that can move. So there's electrical pieces to it so that they don't get to keep it.

838
01:16:42,810 --> 01:16:45,120
And he's like, No, because the kid got real excited and I felt bad.

839
01:16:46,050 --> 01:16:51,660
And then later he I like linger it outside the room and waited for him was like, hey, buddy, hey, can you how do you clean that?

840
01:16:52,050 --> 01:16:55,590
And he was like, What? And I was like, So I work for infection prevention.

841
01:16:55,860 --> 01:17:00,450
And if they don't get to keep those because, you know, we're in a contact room, how do you clean that?

842
01:17:00,460 --> 01:17:04,380
Like, how are you going to clean Legos? They got all kinds of nooks and crannies, like really.

843
01:17:04,770 --> 01:17:07,830
And so then we had to help him with his cleaning protocol.

844
01:17:08,310 --> 01:17:14,970
He tried real hard. I mean, he had a decent start, but definitely, definitely put the steps after that.

845
01:17:15,270 --> 01:17:23,249
But what do you do with electronics? The electronics. So we so what he initially did and you guys can look at it basically he put them in a mesh

846
01:17:23,250 --> 01:17:30,420
bag initially and then he laid the Clorox wipes on top and then filled it with water.

847
01:17:30,810 --> 01:17:35,790
Oh, no, just laid them wipes on top and then fill the container with water as if by osmosis or something.

848
01:17:35,790 --> 01:17:36,870
That stuff was going to come off.

849
01:17:37,110 --> 01:17:44,280
So we switched that and actually gave him a disinfectant that you can soak things in from that perspective and how to like clean and wash.

850
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:50,220
And we actually like have him like shake them up a little bit to try to get some of the nooks and crannies to get the cleaning solution on there.

851
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:54,330
But for the electronic parts, they just wipe them down with an awesome beer and wine.

852
01:17:54,750 --> 01:17:58,260
And he's not he's not they're not allowed to go in contact precaution rooms anymore. Yeah.

853
01:17:58,620 --> 01:18:04,349
Yeah. That's like the most sensible. Yeah. Yeah. So we don't let them in contact the rooms.

854
01:18:04,350 --> 01:18:09,600
We do let them in droplet precautions rooms because actually we're one you can kind of wipe stuff down with.

855
01:18:10,440 --> 01:18:13,530
And if we didn't let him in the droplet rooms, you wouldn't see anybody in the wintertime.

856
01:18:13,530 --> 01:18:20,700
There's every one of the pediatric sides and droplet and so yeah, yeah, that was really fun.

857
01:18:22,470 --> 01:18:29,370
The kids like I get to keep it the guys like no. And I'm like, it was all right, well, let's talk about that because I know things you do.

858
01:18:29,670 --> 01:18:32,970
I don't want you taking that to the next kids room and giving them C diff or something.

859
01:18:33,540 --> 01:18:37,350
So anyway. Well, good to see you guys. Thank you, sir.

860
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:44,430
Yeah, we need some good people in the field, so I get excited when I come to see the fresh new faces who want to do hospital epi.

861
01:18:44,790 --> 01:18:54,690
So. All right. Well, let me bring you in here.

862
01:18:55,770 --> 01:18:59,380
I should. You're circadian rhythm. You have a break.

863
01:18:59,470 --> 01:19:06,010
Yeah, that's right. You know, they should ask going to be North Korea Junior.

864
01:19:06,010 --> 01:19:16,390
I mean, a patient person. Yes. She wasn't sure she was.

865
01:19:16,990 --> 01:19:22,180
Well, we won't know until we get her to my partner.

866
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:28,570
Yeah, that that people forget, like, it's just, like, a real motivator.

867
01:19:28,620 --> 01:19:38,880
So the dancing with that Chris Frazier, that's pretty interesting, you know, hearing, you know.

868
01:19:38,930 --> 01:19:58,860
Yeah. You know she says she's not like I'm like, you know but I just I feel like I'm.

869
01:19:58,980 --> 01:20:02,920
You find anything better off than your boyfriend?

870
01:20:03,340 --> 01:20:10,419
Right. How did you get involved with his mouth?

871
01:20:10,420 --> 01:20:13,780
You know what I mean? Whole.

872
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:30,510
I think, first of all, we do have an exit strategy.

873
01:20:30,510 --> 01:20:40,380
But I think what you're kind of hearing.

874
01:20:42,620 --> 01:20:46,940
Firstly, let us because I know a lot about you.

875
01:20:47,260 --> 01:20:51,910
Yeah, it's interesting because if any of you think that similarly with her.

876
01:20:55,050 --> 01:21:03,660
Like everybody else. I was like, you know, I know what he does.

877
01:21:03,660 --> 01:21:12,840
You know, when it comes on somebody they know exactly they can I.

878
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:31,660
Until very late at night. They were still dancing. He's nothing more than a allegedly.

879
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:35,950
You know, I have no idea.

880
01:21:37,730 --> 01:21:48,370
Ma'am. If that was. Yes, that. You know, I was having.

881
01:21:51,920 --> 01:22:09,570
I don't know. Well, I mean, you realize that, you know, she doesn't have much.

882
01:22:09,990 --> 01:22:13,710
Wow. Yeah, I'm sure you would knew that.

883
01:22:14,390 --> 01:22:19,370
I'm sure. I don't think so. I. I got your slides.

884
01:22:19,390 --> 01:22:24,960
You want them to be what? Do you want them to be in PowerPoint or not?

885
01:22:25,140 --> 01:22:29,170
Because I can. Yeah. Okay. So then why don't you. I mean, I have it on my finger.

886
01:22:29,220 --> 01:22:34,140
Yeah, I have it here. Okay. I can just download it. That's awesome.

887
01:22:34,750 --> 01:22:38,760
Yeah, I'd love it. Oh, okay.

888
01:22:39,110 --> 01:22:43,290
Yeah. And yes, okay.

889
01:22:43,290 --> 01:22:47,640
And then I say enable editing. Yeah, yeah. And then.

890
01:22:47,970 --> 01:22:56,690
Yeah, so. Okay, well, you just let me know whenever, but I'll just give it a minute, you know?

891
01:22:57,040 --> 01:23:05,990
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I really don't know.

892
01:23:06,180 --> 01:23:11,010
I can't see where my you know, your point.

893
01:23:15,540 --> 01:23:25,860
I am. To be fair, I, I suppose you have, you know, I suppose if you are gonna show up, you're going to change the argument around.

894
01:23:26,500 --> 01:23:30,730
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

895
01:23:35,270 --> 01:24:02,270
Yes. We're realizing that all of us are going to be working like ten 000000 yes.

896
01:24:03,770 --> 01:24:07,880
That is accurate. And so I really like this.

897
01:24:08,570 --> 01:24:34,700
Know when I read it's. Making a mother had nothing to do with what we do now, so I don't think we're going to get out of this.

898
01:24:34,940 --> 01:24:46,540
So I feel a little softer, are also not going to be perfect,

899
01:24:46,550 --> 01:25:03,640
but I think it's really important as well that sort of like I guess I would many things that, you know,

900
01:25:05,450 --> 01:25:19,909
it's interesting that there is a conflict over the last year which I don't agree and this is not a good

901
01:25:19,910 --> 01:25:36,410
time is there really is decisions and time is actually know places that have been left out of that.

902
01:25:37,100 --> 01:25:44,420
But I haven't really done anything like that.

903
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:54,080
You know, like what I'm doing is a customer.

904
01:25:58,470 --> 01:26:03,180
Yeah, that's a good question. Oh, man.

905
01:26:04,730 --> 01:26:18,930
I think it's going to be like, yeah, because, you know, I think that people and I,

906
01:26:19,030 --> 01:26:33,680
you know, I've been here for a year, but I know I can tell you what I'm wondering about.

907
01:26:42,020 --> 01:26:56,870
Now I'm like, you know, I want to play for my brother and my dad.

908
01:26:57,360 --> 01:27:06,960
I never felt like I was like before.

909
01:27:11,670 --> 01:27:23,920
And that is obviously the difficulty, I have to be honest, because I got it right know, but I'm doing everything.

910
01:27:24,710 --> 01:27:33,620
So the second half, we have to live in Washington and talk about antibiotic resistant infections.

911
01:27:33,620 --> 01:27:36,739
Right. So it's really good to meet all of you here.

912
01:27:36,740 --> 01:27:40,790
And I just spend the 2 seconds to tell you, tell you.

913
01:27:40,790 --> 01:27:46,669
I work as the hospital epidemiologist at the University of Michigan Health across the street and work

914
01:27:46,670 --> 01:27:53,420
very closely with here at structure Dr. Stoneman who was we worked with the same departments together.

915
01:27:54,260 --> 01:27:58,219
And so today I was going to talk to you about antibiotic resistant infections.

916
01:27:58,220 --> 01:28:01,730
And I think that I spoke to your first your class last year.

917
01:28:01,730 --> 01:28:04,880
And so this isn't a different this is not the same talk.

918
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:10,730
It's a different a different approach. There are a few things that we're going to review again,

919
01:28:11,780 --> 01:28:17,510
but the focus here is really to think about what we do in hospitals to prevent antibiotic resistant infections.

920
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:23,840
And so we'll talk about the burden of antibiotic resistance in the US just to kind of level set again.

921
01:28:24,530 --> 01:28:28,939
I threw in some stuff about public reporting and penalties because they are they

922
01:28:28,940 --> 01:28:34,460
do affect some of the motivation for controlling multi-drug resistant organisms.

923
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:41,300
And if you work in infection prevention in hospitals, this is a part of the world that you live in.

924
01:28:42,350 --> 01:28:48,320
We'll talk again. And this is sort of the review part overall of representative of antibiotic resistant organisms.

925
01:28:48,710 --> 01:28:54,650
And you'll see in some places here some of the slides say MDR rose because that's inside drug resistant organisms.

926
01:28:55,760 --> 01:29:00,860
There's different definitions, but for the purposes of this class, antibiotic resistant organisms arose and arose.

927
01:29:00,860 --> 01:29:08,569
That's that's all the same. We'll talk about risk factors and then the reservoirs for different, different microorganisms.

928
01:29:08,570 --> 01:29:11,660
And then we'll end by talking about the infection prevention strategies.

929
01:29:12,380 --> 01:29:16,730
And we're going to talk about two types of strategies, vertical infection prevention strategies,

930
01:29:16,730 --> 01:29:20,210
which really focus on one organism, one type of resistance,

931
01:29:20,570 --> 01:29:28,040
and then the horizontal strategies, which are all the different things that you've been learning about over the course of this this class.

932
01:29:29,420 --> 01:29:33,530
So just remember that antibiotic resistance is a big problem.

933
01:29:33,530 --> 01:29:37,280
It's a big problem globally. It's big problem in the United States.

934
01:29:38,180 --> 01:29:48,320
And it's estimated that there are a minimum of at least 2000 antibiotic resistant illnesses in the U.S. and associated with 23,000 deaths.

935
01:29:49,190 --> 01:29:53,269
And then there's some information about C difficile, which is not really the focus of the talk here.

936
01:29:53,270 --> 01:29:56,930
But see, difficile is you know, it's not particularly antibiotic resistant,

937
01:29:57,170 --> 01:30:01,999
but it is approached in very much the same way as we think about how to control antibiotic

938
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:08,540
resistant organisms in the way that antibiotic use and how we approach the environmental care.

939
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:19,220
So when we look at what organisms are really thinking about, we have to look at what organisms do we see causing health care associated infections,

940
01:30:19,580 --> 01:30:23,430
and then which ones really are the ones that tend to have more antibiotic resistance.

941
01:30:23,780 --> 01:30:32,570
And so this is a recent table looking at the 15 most frequently reported pathogens across adult health care associated infections.

942
01:30:32,990 --> 01:30:39,860
And the first one is E coli. And anyone think about Y e coli would be the primary number one, not Dr. Foxman.

943
01:30:39,860 --> 01:30:47,720
She can't answer what what infection is E coli classically associated with UTI?

944
01:30:48,200 --> 01:30:53,900
Yeah. So these are a catheter associated utilities or health care onset UTI, which are a problem in hospitals.

945
01:30:54,530 --> 01:30:57,559
And then staph aureus is the the next on the list.

946
01:30:57,560 --> 01:31:01,580
And that causes a myriad of different health care associated infections.

947
01:31:01,580 --> 01:31:05,780
And then you can read through the list and we're going to talk about, you know, all these organs, not all of them.

948
01:31:05,780 --> 01:31:10,880
We're going to talk about the big the top organisms as we go through our talk today.

949
01:31:11,990 --> 01:31:20,240
And then this is just a table looking at, okay, above all those organisms that tend to cause health care associated infections,

950
01:31:20,540 --> 01:31:23,840
what percent of them are resistant to antibiotics?

951
01:31:24,140 --> 01:31:30,799
And at the top, you see staph aureus and you can see that 48% of them are not susceptible.

952
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:34,340
So resistant to Oxo and methicillin.

953
01:31:34,340 --> 01:31:37,490
So they're Mersa. So about 40%, 48%.

954
01:31:37,850 --> 01:31:41,750
You can remember 50% if you wanted to. That's a good number to kind of think about.

955
01:31:42,380 --> 01:31:47,630
And then when you look at Enterococcus VCM, this is where we're worried about vancomycin resistance.

956
01:31:47,900 --> 01:31:53,780
This is a big pathogen, a big problem in hospitals, and it's 82% are resistant to vancomycin.

957
01:31:54,320 --> 01:31:56,450
And you can go down here and I'll just pick out another one.

958
01:31:56,450 --> 01:32:07,130
Klebsiella species, 21% are extended spectrum, beta lactamase producers, so they're resistant to most beta lactams except for carbapenems.

959
01:32:07,580 --> 01:32:11,430
And then 6.9% are actually carbon. Kind of resistant to.

960
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:15,180
And if you look at trends across time, you can see these trends are going up.

961
01:32:17,460 --> 01:32:23,370
So why do we care? Well, multi-drug resistant organisms increase the patient's length of stay in the hospital.

962
01:32:24,180 --> 01:32:30,870
They increase mortality and they increase cost. And you might say mortality is probably the one that we should focus on the most.

963
01:32:30,870 --> 01:32:36,389
And I would agree. And we know that Mersa bacteremia has higher mortality and stuff.

964
01:32:36,390 --> 01:32:41,250
And, as I say, bacteremia. Many studies have shown this and including a meta analysis.

965
01:32:42,120 --> 01:32:48,240
We know that very bacteremia has increased mortality compared to think on licenses and sensitive bacteremia.

966
01:32:48,660 --> 01:32:55,430
And some of this is because we aren't choosing necessarily the right drug to begin treatment or that our treatments are just less effective.

967
01:32:56,910 --> 01:33:01,410
And then length of stay is it's a variable depending upon what infection you're talking about.

968
01:33:01,410 --> 01:33:05,069
And this is when you compare it to somebody who happens to get a health care associated infection.

969
01:33:05,070 --> 01:33:11,729
So already has an increased length of stay. But you compare a sensitive infection to a resistant infection,

970
01:33:11,730 --> 01:33:20,310
and there's an additional 1 to 3 days of duration in the hospital compared to patients with drug sensitive infection.

971
01:33:20,520 --> 01:33:30,179
And the costs are listed there, which add up to somewhere between 2 to 3 and a half billion dollars nationally on an annual basis.

972
01:33:30,180 --> 01:33:35,580
And that's looking at a nice study that looked at 6 million hospitalizations and tried to estimate those costs.

973
01:33:37,160 --> 01:33:42,530
So you can imagine that with that information about mortality, about costs, about length of stay,

974
01:33:42,920 --> 01:33:47,090
that there are lots of people in public health and in government who are interested,

975
01:33:47,090 --> 01:33:51,920
government payers who are interested in making sure that hospitals pay attention to this.

976
01:33:52,820 --> 01:33:58,250
And so there are lots of external factors that we in infection prevention pay attention to.

977
01:33:58,580 --> 01:34:05,630
And sometimes they're thorns in our side, but sometimes they really spark improvements across across hospitals nationally.

978
01:34:05,930 --> 01:34:07,879
One of those agencies is the Joint Commission,

979
01:34:07,880 --> 01:34:14,060
their regulatory agency in most hospitals in the United States choose to be accredited by the Joint Commission.

980
01:34:15,350 --> 01:34:20,089
And one of their goals is that hospitals really need to implement evidence based

981
01:34:20,090 --> 01:34:24,500
practices to prevent health care associated infections due to resistant organisms.

982
01:34:25,010 --> 01:34:28,459
And it's limited to these it's list of these here.

983
01:34:28,460 --> 01:34:32,160
But there are others, obviously, as well. And that's a pretty good goal.

984
01:34:32,180 --> 01:34:39,470
I don't think anyone could argue that we need to do that. But we also need to know what are the evidence based practices to do this.

985
01:34:40,040 --> 01:34:47,170
And we'll talk about that today. And then a lot of different requirements for antibiotic resistance reporting.

986
01:34:47,180 --> 01:34:47,770
They vary.

987
01:34:47,780 --> 01:34:56,570
There's not really a national requirement per say, although a lot of hospitals participate in and HSN and report various antibiotic resistance.

988
01:34:56,900 --> 01:35:02,000
But this is just a list of the different states that require different types of reporting.

989
01:35:02,930 --> 01:35:11,870
And then you'll see that for MRSA, Michigan represents recall requires outbreak reporting or clusters of reporting.

990
01:35:11,870 --> 01:35:18,260
And we do that frequently. If we have a cluster of a variety of things, I will report to the health department.

991
01:35:18,770 --> 01:35:23,080
And then carbapenem producing carbapenem resistant bacteria.

992
01:35:23,180 --> 01:35:28,610
Okay. So CRC are also publicly reportable in Michigan as of four years ago.

993
01:35:30,830 --> 01:35:35,149
And so so those are sort of what's required.

994
01:35:35,150 --> 01:35:38,900
And then there's a sort of a carrot stick.

995
01:35:38,900 --> 01:35:41,900
The stick is the carrot. There's carrots and sticks.

996
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:45,260
So value based purchasing is a carrot, basically,

997
01:35:46,100 --> 01:35:52,430
that there's a component of the Affordable Care Act and it's actually funded by reducing payments to hospitals.

998
01:35:52,460 --> 01:35:56,570
I have the 2% for each hospital discharge and then hospitals have to earn their

999
01:35:56,570 --> 01:36:03,530
money back by performing well on a variety of health care associated conditions.

1000
01:36:03,830 --> 01:36:08,480
And you can get money back by improving. You can get money back by being a top performer.

1001
01:36:09,080 --> 01:36:14,030
And they use the thresholds of how everybody's doing that year of 50th percentile of hospitals.

1002
01:36:14,840 --> 01:36:19,639
And then the benchmark where you're really targeted for is the mean of the top decile hospitals.

1003
01:36:19,640 --> 01:36:23,360
So it's a it's an A-plus kind of thing that you're trying to get here.

1004
01:36:24,170 --> 01:36:28,940
And if you look at this, there's lots of things that go into this report card and how you earn back money.

1005
01:36:28,940 --> 01:36:30,440
But at the bottom is safety.

1006
01:36:31,370 --> 01:36:38,720
And you can see there's lots of measures that you guys have been learning about in this class, like clouds, the antibody and surgical site infection.

1007
01:36:39,020 --> 01:36:43,549
But you'll see there that methicillin resistant staph aureus bacteremia is listed there.

1008
01:36:43,550 --> 01:36:55,220
And so that's how they're incorporating antibiotic resistance and also meaningful outcomes like bacteremia as a measure that we can look at.

1009
01:36:56,930 --> 01:37:07,130
There's also another program called the Hack Reduction Program, also through the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which is a penalty.

1010
01:37:07,310 --> 01:37:16,670
So the stick. So the worst performing quartile or the worst performing, 25% of hospitals are subject to a 1% reduction in Medicare payments.

1011
01:37:17,180 --> 01:37:27,620
And it looks at a variety of things. But what you can see here is that Mersa bacteremia is on the list, as are many other device related infections.

1012
01:37:28,430 --> 01:37:32,750
And then for transparency, this is all reported.

1013
01:37:33,110 --> 01:37:41,149
And anyone you could look it up right now, you could look up how hospitals are are performing based on these measures.

1014
01:37:41,150 --> 01:37:44,809
And I just pulled this. This is actually from, I think one or two years ago.

1015
01:37:44,810 --> 01:37:50,150
But the University of Michigan performs with a standardized infection ratio,

1016
01:37:50,150 --> 01:37:56,750
which is observed to expected ratio for the bacteremia of 0.67, where the benchmark is one.

1017
01:37:57,260 --> 01:38:04,339
So that looks great. It says we're not different than national benchmark because they do want this to be statistically significant.

1018
01:38:04,340 --> 01:38:09,020
So you have to be a really, really top performer to get that to be different.

1019
01:38:09,020 --> 01:38:10,640
But if you were a patient looking at this,

1020
01:38:10,760 --> 01:38:17,780
you don't you may not want to go to a hospital that has a lot of things that say worse than national benchmark.

1021
01:38:18,020 --> 01:38:20,630
You can see Saint Joseph's Hospital there just for comparison.

1022
01:38:20,900 --> 01:38:26,240
And the VA doesn't actually report a lot of their data because they don't actually get paid through CMS.

1023
01:38:26,240 --> 01:38:31,380
They get paid through the Veterans Administration. So. Okay.

1024
01:38:31,730 --> 01:38:36,020
So next, we'll talk a little bit about examples of these different.

1025
01:38:37,010 --> 01:38:41,840
Antibiotic resistant organisms. And this is the stuff that we went over last year.

1026
01:38:42,680 --> 01:38:47,450
We went over the multi-drug resistant organisms that some have termed escape organisms.

1027
01:38:47,930 --> 01:38:52,700
So this is Enterococcus, VCM, Staph aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae,

1028
01:38:52,700 --> 01:39:00,530
and I just added candida auris for the C acinetobacter baumannii pseudomonas and bacteria.

1029
01:39:01,460 --> 01:39:10,730
So you all know methicillin resistant staph aureus. There are over 80,000 severe mersa infections per year and over 11,000 deaths,

1030
01:39:10,730 --> 01:39:14,600
and there really are a leading cause of health care associated infections.

1031
01:39:15,530 --> 01:39:17,329
There has been some decrease in this.

1032
01:39:17,330 --> 01:39:27,200
And that's to the to the credit of all the work that's going on to reduce health care associated infections, and they cause all kinds of infections.

1033
01:39:27,200 --> 01:39:32,840
You remember surgical site infection, central line, bloodstream infections, pneumonia.

1034
01:39:32,900 --> 01:39:40,080
Those are the big ones that we see staph aureus causing in hospitals for vancomycin resistant Enterococcus II.

1035
01:39:40,110 --> 01:39:43,340
This is where we're really talking about that enterococcus fusion.

1036
01:39:44,330 --> 01:39:52,670
And there's the numbers there, up to 66,000 Enterococcus infections per year and 20,000 drug resistant infections.

1037
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:57,230
And these are becoming increasingly hard to treat. They're developing increasing resistance.

1038
01:39:58,010 --> 01:40:00,379
And we do have a handful of drugs that we use.

1039
01:40:00,380 --> 01:40:07,220
But in this organism, we sometimes see development of resistance during treatment, and that's a real problem.

1040
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:11,750
And so this is where we see this in urinary tract infections.

1041
01:40:11,750 --> 01:40:16,040
We see this in interim domino infections frequently and in bloodstream infections.

1042
01:40:19,120 --> 01:40:27,190
Carbapenem resistant ultra bacteria a.k.a. so remember interior bacteria a.k.a. are the organisms that make up the gut flora.

1043
01:40:27,640 --> 01:40:30,670
E coli, klebsiella, things like that.

1044
01:40:31,450 --> 01:40:40,600
And these have kind of came onto the scene probably about 15 years ago now, maybe 20 years ago now.

1045
01:40:41,170 --> 01:40:45,070
And there are about 9000 drug resistant infections per year.

1046
01:40:45,760 --> 01:40:49,660
And some of these are resistant to all or nearly all available antibiotics.

1047
01:40:50,140 --> 01:40:53,920
We see these across the gamut of health care associated infections,

1048
01:40:53,920 --> 01:41:01,059
but primarily it's in urine and in respiratory tract specimens and in wounds we rarely see,

1049
01:41:01,060 --> 01:41:04,690
at least in our hospital bloodstream infections from series.

1050
01:41:04,690 --> 01:41:07,900
But when we see them, they're associated with very high mortality.

1051
01:41:10,720 --> 01:41:15,610
Carbapenem resistant acinetobacter, you'll hear this referred to as crab.

1052
01:41:15,880 --> 01:41:27,130
So crab. This is a real a problem because this is another organism that picks up resistance mechanisms and develops resistance while we're treating.

1053
01:41:28,270 --> 01:41:36,550
And so over time, there has been some decrease in the overall cases of crab in the United States.

1054
01:41:36,970 --> 01:41:41,290
But there are pockets of places where that's their organism that they really have problems with.

1055
01:41:42,040 --> 01:41:46,809
In our hospital, we see very little crab, but we see a lot of pseudomonas.

1056
01:41:46,810 --> 01:41:52,030
That's carbapenem resistance. If you go to places like the Detroit Medical Center, they see a lot of crab.

1057
01:41:52,030 --> 01:41:59,200
It's just sort of what your hospital flora is like. But these organisms really survive for a long time in the hospital environment.

1058
01:41:59,200 --> 01:42:06,610
They're really hardy and they can really when they get into your health care system, they can be a real problem to eradicate.

1059
01:42:08,200 --> 01:42:16,840
So multidrug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as you know, Pseudomonas is a is a very frequent health care associated infection pathogen.

1060
01:42:17,740 --> 01:42:26,469
And we see this primarily, I'll say primarily we see this in pneumonias, to be honest, and pneumonias in our intensive care unit nationally.

1061
01:42:26,470 --> 01:42:30,070
Over time, the number of cases has been going down, which is good.

1062
01:42:30,580 --> 01:42:34,180
And this is an area of focus for the coming years in our hospital,

1063
01:42:34,180 --> 01:42:43,600
we decided we really need to focus on Pseudomonas in our hospital and then I'll, I'll end by talking about drug resistant Candida Auris.

1064
01:42:43,810 --> 01:42:48,400
So Candida isn't is that common? It's a commensal skin organism.

1065
01:42:48,730 --> 01:42:56,320
Everyone has Candida somewhere on their skin and most of the time it does not transmit from person to person.

1066
01:42:56,980 --> 01:43:02,380
Candida Auris is different. Candida Auris does cause outbreaks in hospitals.

1067
01:43:03,040 --> 01:43:08,409
It survives in the environment, particularly kind of warm tropical environments.

1068
01:43:08,410 --> 01:43:12,130
So there's much more problems with this in tropical areas of the world.

1069
01:43:13,270 --> 01:43:17,410
And it's and it survives in the environment in general as well.

1070
01:43:17,980 --> 01:43:20,950
And it is associated with drug resistance.

1071
01:43:21,970 --> 01:43:29,080
And and Dr. Foxman was just telling me, we don't we haven't seen transmission of Candida Auris in our hospitals.

1072
01:43:29,470 --> 01:43:40,930
I'll put s in Ann Arbor. But we have had patients who have acquired Candida Auris at other places and then come in to our hospital.

1073
01:43:41,380 --> 01:43:48,100
And Dr. Foxman was telling me that that their work has seen candida auris in wastewater.

1074
01:43:48,790 --> 01:43:53,320
So she was asking me, do we have any patients in the hospital with us because do we have an explanation?

1075
01:43:54,100 --> 01:44:01,239
So, so but this is really one of the emerging threats that she can really expect to have to know about.

1076
01:44:01,240 --> 01:44:08,350
If you go into infection prevention and health care and the cases are increasing over time and there's always a new bug.

1077
01:44:09,720 --> 01:44:13,480
Don't think that when we, when we finish with one that it's all over.

1078
01:44:14,110 --> 01:44:18,760
Yeah. Infectious diseases will always be with us one way or another.

1079
01:44:19,300 --> 01:44:22,480
That's right. And that's one of the exciting things about the field, too.

1080
01:44:23,470 --> 01:44:29,620
You don't necessarily relearn everything when there's a new pathogen because you can take what you know and then

1081
01:44:29,620 --> 01:44:36,910
learn about the microbiology and the what's happening in patients and then direct your interventions that way.

1082
01:44:38,140 --> 01:44:41,140
I put up a slide for C diff. Again, not antibiotic resistance.

1083
01:44:41,260 --> 01:44:46,030
I suspect you have another talk on this or did last year. Yeah,

1084
01:44:46,030 --> 01:44:49,870
but it's a big one and it costs a lot of money for health care and it makes patients

1085
01:44:49,870 --> 01:44:54,700
miserable even if they don't die from it or have to end up in the hospital.

1086
01:44:54,910 --> 01:44:59,370
You don't want it? Yeah. No, it's a it's a big deal.

1087
01:44:59,380 --> 01:45:04,510
So. Okay, so let's talk a little bit about who's at risk.

1088
01:45:05,140 --> 01:45:11,500
We're all walking around in the community and I don't really worry about picking up Candida Auris myself in the community.

1089
01:45:11,500 --> 01:45:17,110
I don't worry about many of these things in the community. And I don't really worry about them as a health care worker who follows.

1090
01:45:17,380 --> 01:45:21,220
The precautions that we should do, but who is at risk? It's really our patients.

1091
01:45:22,210 --> 01:45:28,090
And so it's our patients who are under selective pressure with antibiotics.

1092
01:45:29,440 --> 01:45:36,040
It's our patients if we're in a facility that has poor compliance with infection prevention practices, if hand hygiene is poor,

1093
01:45:36,490 --> 01:45:43,780
cleaning is poor for environmental cleaning is poor in places where there's increased rates of community colonization,

1094
01:45:43,780 --> 01:45:50,589
I guess I could say for community acquired more so that could get into the hospital and spread and in places of the world.

1095
01:45:50,590 --> 01:45:54,850
Since for instance, India, where there's a lot of carbapenem resistance,

1096
01:45:54,850 --> 01:46:00,880
the community colonization rate may impact what's going on in the hospital, but also host characteristics.

1097
01:46:01,630 --> 01:46:09,670
And this shouldn't surprise you, really. And I can put up a slide for each row, but they're really going to have very common risk factors.

1098
01:46:10,450 --> 01:46:13,870
In particular, patients in the ICU are at increased risk.

1099
01:46:14,290 --> 01:46:19,750
Those who have invasive devices, those who've had recent surgery, those who are on dialysis.

1100
01:46:20,170 --> 01:46:25,900
And then if you're in a unit or a hospital where there's lots of other patients who have those resistant organisms,

1101
01:46:26,170 --> 01:46:29,950
that's called colonization pressure. And I'm going to explain that to you in a later slide.

1102
01:46:31,420 --> 01:46:36,970
And then if you look at specific organisms, you can see some differences in the risk factors.

1103
01:46:38,050 --> 01:46:45,970
And I just picked MRSA as an example, high age like extremes of ages, elderly and then neonates,

1104
01:46:46,120 --> 01:46:50,950
kind of the to two extremes intensive care units being in the hospital,

1105
01:46:51,010 --> 01:46:58,750
prior hospitals being in the hospital a long time, going from one hospital to another hospital, living in a nursing home or extended care facility.

1106
01:46:59,140 --> 01:47:05,379
We said dialysis, cystic fibrosis, transplant patients, patients who've been on antibiotics,

1107
01:47:05,380 --> 01:47:08,800
those who have invasive procedures or devices, colonization, pressure.

1108
01:47:08,800 --> 01:47:18,370
Again, intravenous drug users, those who have open skin lesions tend to kind of hang on to so organisms like staphylococcus burn units,

1109
01:47:18,370 --> 01:47:21,070
burn patients and those with rheumatologic diseases.

1110
01:47:21,610 --> 01:47:30,670
And each of these organisms will sort of have their own slightly unique risk factors, but there are many overlapping, overlapping risk factors.

1111
01:47:32,710 --> 01:47:37,690
So when we talk about multi-drug resistant organisms, antibiotic resistant organisms,

1112
01:47:38,440 --> 01:47:43,240
we need to be thoughtful about what we're talking about in clinical medicine.

1113
01:47:43,750 --> 01:47:47,110
You know, the outcomes that we care about are clinical infection.

1114
01:47:47,560 --> 01:47:52,090
Patients need to get treated if they have bacteria in their blood,

1115
01:47:52,150 --> 01:47:57,520
if they have symptomatic bacteria in their urine, if they have a surgical site infection.

1116
01:47:58,670 --> 01:48:08,410
But but those are just a minority of the patients who actually have multi-drug resistant or antibiotic resistant organisms within their microbiome.

1117
01:48:08,830 --> 01:48:14,739
And this is just a kind of the classic picture that people will show that those

1118
01:48:14,740 --> 01:48:19,120
that we know about from clinical infection are really just the tip of the iceberg.

1119
01:48:19,360 --> 01:48:26,980
There's a whole bunch of people in the hospital who are colonized carrying asymptomatically, multidrug resistant organisms.

1120
01:48:27,310 --> 01:48:32,620
And knowing that and thinking about that really impacts how we think about control.

1121
01:48:34,750 --> 01:48:42,640
So I'm going to talk to you about reservoirs of colonized patients and infected patients, but these are different for different organisms.

1122
01:48:43,120 --> 01:48:52,699
So for MRSA or staph aureus, colonized and infected patients frequently can have the organism identified in the anterior nares.

1123
01:48:52,700 --> 01:48:56,200
So the very front part of the nose, it's nice and cool. The bacteria like to grow.

1124
01:48:56,200 --> 01:49:01,030
There can also be seen in the axilla. The armpits, the groin, the perineum.

1125
01:49:02,830 --> 01:49:06,180
Any skin lesions? If someone has a wound, if someone has eczema,

1126
01:49:06,190 --> 01:49:12,940
more likely to carry staphylococcus ulcers in the skin and then the GI tract can be colonized by Mersa as well.

1127
01:49:13,660 --> 01:49:21,290
And then colonies, health care workers can be a reservoir, but that typically isn't the reservoir that we worry about in endemic Mersa.

1128
01:49:21,310 --> 01:49:26,680
We do worry about that if there is an outbreak that that health care workers could be involved in.

1129
01:49:27,340 --> 01:49:33,669
And then the environment is probably a lesser role for Mersa than other materials, but it's certainly there.

1130
01:49:33,670 --> 01:49:38,650
And, you know, Dr. Foxman works can show that it's definitely there in an environment of places like nursing homes.

1131
01:49:38,850 --> 01:49:45,780
Yeah. Yep. Okay. And how about a resistant Enterococcus II?

1132
01:49:46,360 --> 01:49:50,530
So this is primarily intestinal tract colonization.

1133
01:49:50,530 --> 01:49:53,920
So Antarctica's is an organism that's in the gut.

1134
01:49:54,430 --> 01:50:01,540
The gut, basically. And enterococcus ficus, which is not the one that is associated most often with resistance,

1135
01:50:01,750 --> 01:50:09,250
is found in 80% of patients, which is it's normal to have enterococcus and 30% of patients have Enterococcus VCM.

1136
01:50:09,850 --> 01:50:14,070
So in some portion of those patients that have resistant Enterococcus VCM,

1137
01:50:14,650 --> 01:50:23,410
what we know is that people with important outcomes like Enterococcus bacteremia, 100% of them also had intestinal colonization.

1138
01:50:24,100 --> 01:50:27,700
So colonization precedes infection in many of these cases.

1139
01:50:28,720 --> 01:50:36,160
What's not intuitive about Enterococcus is that it's found on the skin and in hospitals flies patients.

1140
01:50:36,820 --> 01:50:41,290
86% of patients with the ear bacteremia are colonized on the skin.

1141
01:50:41,680 --> 01:50:47,110
And so people will talk about our skin isn't sterile. It's kind of gross, but it's also a barrier.

1142
01:50:47,110 --> 01:50:48,880
It just protects itself. Things are there.

1143
01:50:49,510 --> 01:50:57,520
But when you put a central line is you disrupt that barrier and some of these bacteria resistant and sensitive can get in.

1144
01:50:58,390 --> 01:51:08,490
And so we see this on the skin and people call this the fecal patina, which is like being covered in lots of mycobacterium from the the the feet,

1145
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:17,050
the fecal areas we see enterococci in wounds and environmental surfaces are really important for enterococci.

1146
01:51:17,350 --> 01:51:23,470
There have been outbreaks associated with electronics, thermometers, particularly in the days when rectal thermometers were used.

1147
01:51:23,770 --> 01:51:30,550
Although we don't do that in hospitals anymore, at least in adults, and that can be a good pressure.

1148
01:51:31,410 --> 01:51:42,389
Gowns and linens and beds and bedside tables and certainly on commodes for carbapenem resistant Enterobacteriaceae A C or E, we see rectal carriage.

1149
01:51:42,390 --> 01:51:47,370
So the GI tract, we see skin carriage, the groin and stuff below the waist typically.

1150
01:51:48,270 --> 01:51:53,220
And then the hospital environment in the vicinity of the patient. Frequently you can find the organisms.

1151
01:51:53,670 --> 01:52:01,230
We also see this in our sinks and in our trains, which I was not going to talk about much here, but it's fascinating to think about this.

1152
01:52:02,640 --> 01:52:06,660
And then for Candida Auris, mostly it's the skin and it's the warm,

1153
01:52:06,720 --> 01:52:12,900
moist areas such as the armpits and the groin and then also in the external ear canals.

1154
01:52:12,900 --> 01:52:17,460
And you can say, hmm, that's interesting because Candida auris, auris is here.

1155
01:52:18,200 --> 01:52:21,840
And so some of the first cases were seen in that location,

1156
01:52:22,290 --> 01:52:27,630
but it does survive on environmental surfaces and you can find it in urine wounds and the rectum.

1157
01:52:29,460 --> 01:52:33,300
So it's promising that I'll tell you about colonization pressure.

1158
01:52:33,720 --> 01:52:44,460
This is how we talk about what someone's risks might be in the various units or various hospitals or various other demographic areas,

1159
01:52:44,820 --> 01:52:49,560
you know, in the state of New York or in particular country.

1160
01:52:50,070 --> 01:52:57,360
So acquisitions of MRSA and other materials in the ICU is highly determined by colonization pressure.

1161
01:52:57,960 --> 01:53:03,360
So you may be less likely to get Mersa if you're in an ICU that doesn't have any other of patients in.

1162
01:53:04,470 --> 01:53:11,940
And so this is calculated by taking the number of mercy carrier patient days, dividing it by the week,

1163
01:53:12,480 --> 01:53:16,980
per total number of patient days per week on the date of the patient's admission.

1164
01:53:16,980 --> 01:53:18,370
So that's kind of complicated.

1165
01:53:18,390 --> 01:53:31,290
But if you have a patient, if you have a ten that I see you and you have ten patients in that ICU for seven days, you would have 70 patient days.

1166
01:53:31,440 --> 01:53:35,970
Right? Okay. So that's your denominator, total patient days.

1167
01:53:36,330 --> 01:53:44,190
And if you had one patient who had Mersa and they were there that same week, they would have seven patient days.

1168
01:53:44,310 --> 01:53:49,740
So your colonization would be seven over 70 and you can do the math for that.

1169
01:53:51,300 --> 01:53:59,040
And it's been found that if that colonization pressure is above 30%, the risk of acquisition of Mersa is five times higher.

1170
01:53:59,340 --> 01:54:03,870
And it's not not an, you know, switch that goes off at 30%.

1171
01:54:03,870 --> 01:54:07,560
It's incremental. And you see this with other organisms as well.

1172
01:54:08,220 --> 01:54:10,110
But it continues from. Yes.

1173
01:54:11,220 --> 01:54:19,350
So I'll just remind us how two patients get exposed to multi-drug resistant organisms as we think about ways to prevent this.

1174
01:54:19,650 --> 01:54:23,010
This is just a model of looking at patients who come into the hospital.

1175
01:54:23,010 --> 01:54:29,730
They don't have antibiotic resistant organisms and they either come out of the hospital with an antibiotic resistant organism or without.

1176
01:54:30,270 --> 01:54:37,379
And the things that we talked about that that predict that or that our risks are the patient factors which are listed above.

1177
01:54:37,380 --> 01:54:44,130
We went through those and then facility factors. And so how often are invasive devices like urinary catheter juice?

1178
01:54:44,340 --> 01:54:49,500
How good is the hand hygiene? How good are gown and gloves usage for particular organisms?

1179
01:54:49,770 --> 01:54:53,520
How about staffing? Are the environmental services people working too hard?

1180
01:54:53,550 --> 01:54:58,170
Are they overseeing in the correct ways? How about nursing? Do we have a shortage of nurses?

1181
01:54:58,170 --> 01:55:02,140
Does that affect how we can? Actually do our job in the correct way.

1182
01:55:02,830 --> 01:55:04,360
And then the cleanliness of the environment.

1183
01:55:04,360 --> 01:55:12,250
And then also just like is your hospital, an old hospital that has a bunch of multi patient rooms where you're going to be exposed to your roommate.

1184
01:55:14,290 --> 01:55:17,890
And so those those are really important things to think about and try to mitigate.

1185
01:55:18,070 --> 01:55:20,740
Not everything, not everything you can change.

1186
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:28,510
And then just this is also just really important, sort of I think the basic of basic about this class in general.

1187
01:55:29,140 --> 01:55:37,450
But, you know, our susceptible patients, our goal is to make them not have a multi-drug resistant organism and they

1188
01:55:37,450 --> 01:55:42,370
can they're at risk from directly contacting contaminated and adamant surface

1189
01:55:42,370 --> 01:55:47,079
if they're kind of hanging out and there's a whole bunch of theory on their in

1190
01:55:47,080 --> 01:55:51,820
their bathroom and a whole bunch of area on their tabletop where they eat.

1191
01:55:51,880 --> 01:56:00,970
Right. That can be direct transmission or it could be indirect where I as a health care worker, touch all those areas,

1192
01:56:01,300 --> 01:56:10,030
get it on my hands, and then don't wash my hands or use the hand sanitizer effectively and transfer it to a susceptible patient.

1193
01:56:12,660 --> 01:56:16,950
So now we're going to go on to, well, what are the strategies? And these are really important.

1194
01:56:17,430 --> 01:56:23,909
And some of these strategies become are very, very agreed upon in infection prevention.

1195
01:56:23,910 --> 01:56:31,380
And some are more controversial, and they become more or less popular based upon evidence that changes from time to time.

1196
01:56:32,670 --> 01:56:37,620
But what I want you to think about is as we think about these strategies is something

1197
01:56:37,620 --> 01:56:42,870
called is vertical infection prevention versus horizontal infection prevention.

1198
01:56:43,650 --> 01:56:49,920
When we talk about a vertical approach, we're really focusing on one pathogen or a subset of pathogens.

1199
01:56:50,430 --> 01:56:54,690
We're talking about we want to prevent Mersa, we want to prevent very we want to prevent surgery.

1200
01:56:55,500 --> 01:56:58,710
And if you look at, say, for instance, and Bursa targeted approach,

1201
01:56:59,100 --> 01:57:08,400
we know that that approach can save about 1500 to 3000 lives and a lot of money, 24 245 to $980 million annually.

1202
01:57:10,050 --> 01:57:14,520
Or and or we could do a horizontal approach where we say, you know what,

1203
01:57:14,520 --> 01:57:18,690
it's really not okay for anyone to get any kind of hospital associated infection.

1204
01:57:18,960 --> 01:57:25,770
And we want all of it to go down. And by so doing, maybe we'll also see a decrease in resistant pathogens.

1205
01:57:26,310 --> 01:57:31,470
And this is a population based approach that saves more lives and more money, at least in modeling.

1206
01:57:32,070 --> 01:57:37,530
And it's really not all or other. We have to do both of these in the real world of hospital infection prevention.

1207
01:57:39,090 --> 01:57:45,900
And this is an old slide, but it just illustrates the fact that if we were only to focus on Mersa in our hospital,

1208
01:57:47,070 --> 01:57:51,420
we would be focusing on that very small slice of the pie, which is red.

1209
01:57:52,180 --> 01:57:59,280
And so the percent of all infections caused by Mersa in the hospital is really only about 6%.

1210
01:58:00,480 --> 01:58:03,720
And then that if you that's a one window to look at it.

1211
01:58:04,260 --> 01:58:08,579
If you were focusing, say, on Mersa and you looked at another window and you said,

1212
01:58:08,580 --> 01:58:13,799
yeah, but it's, you know, 38% of all your staph aureus infections, you could see,

1213
01:58:13,800 --> 01:58:21,090
depending upon what lens you're looking at, what leads you to maybe different approaches to how you're managing infection prevention in your hospital.

1214
01:58:21,840 --> 01:58:26,909
And also, you know, it's not good to get at methicillin susceptible staph or his bacteremia.

1215
01:58:26,910 --> 01:58:29,280
The outcomes aren't good, treatment is hard.

1216
01:58:29,730 --> 01:58:35,490
And then things like your base strap, if you have an outbreak of group A strep in your in your O.R., that's bad too.

1217
01:58:35,490 --> 01:58:39,479
And it's not necessarily resistant. Yeah, it's still penicillin sensitive.

1218
01:58:39,480 --> 01:58:44,010
Thank goodness. We'll see on that. Yeah, it's pretty amazing, isn't it?

1219
01:58:44,400 --> 01:58:49,889
Yeah, it's very surprising. Yeah. So group B strep is is remains penicillin sensitive.

1220
01:58:49,890 --> 01:58:54,840
That's why if you get a strep throat, you'll get penicillin or amoxicillin and it's super effective.

1221
01:58:54,840 --> 01:59:04,260
And I don't know, it's also had a lot of penicillin pressure over time, so there's got to be something evolutionary about it.

1222
01:59:04,260 --> 01:59:07,989
So yeah. So getting erythromycin resistance.

1223
01:59:07,990 --> 01:59:10,890
So yeah, it's not to everything. So yeah.

1224
01:59:11,730 --> 01:59:18,690
So when we talk about these infection interventions, infection prevention interventions, I've listed them here,

1225
01:59:18,690 --> 01:59:23,940
we're going to go through them and elicit a, V, R and H, whether about whether they're vertical, more horizontal.

1226
01:59:24,480 --> 01:59:30,330
So there's contact precautions, active surveillance and patient decolonization, which are vertical strategies.

1227
01:59:30,810 --> 01:59:33,810
And then for horizontal strategies, we have hand hygiene,

1228
01:59:34,230 --> 01:59:40,350
all of the evidence based insertion and care of devices, environmental cleaning and antimicrobial stewardship.

1229
01:59:41,760 --> 01:59:44,790
So again, those are the vertical infection prevention strategies.

1230
01:59:45,390 --> 01:59:49,680
So contact precautions. So contact precautions isn't one thing.

1231
01:59:50,070 --> 01:59:52,110
It's a group of things. It's a bundle, right?

1232
01:59:52,920 --> 01:59:59,249
And it's really putting patients who are either colonized or infected with a multidrug resistant organism of interest into

1233
01:59:59,250 --> 02:00:06,450
a private room or putting two patients with the same antibiotic resistant organism into the same room called Cohorting.

1234
02:00:07,360 --> 02:00:14,610
And in and when we care for those patients, we as health care workers use gloves, gowns every time that we go into the room.

1235
02:00:14,820 --> 02:00:18,420
And of course, we should wash our hands before and after putting on those glass.

1236
02:00:19,020 --> 02:00:23,250
We shouldn't take the patient from room to room to room and wander them around the hospital.

1237
02:00:23,260 --> 02:00:27,870
So we should limit their transport. They should have disposable or dedicated equipment.

1238
02:00:28,050 --> 02:00:31,200
So the blood pressure cuff needs to stay in the room.

1239
02:00:31,260 --> 02:00:39,120
It shouldn't be going in and out of the room. We use disposable stethoscopes to listen to the patient's heart, lungs,

1240
02:00:39,510 --> 02:00:43,640
and then in some cases, there's different environmental cleaning that's done for it,

1241
02:00:43,650 --> 02:00:51,330
particularly for things like C difficile, where where you need to use a societal cleaning agent that you probably have learned about in this class.

1242
02:00:53,020 --> 02:01:01,240
So that's contact precautions. The second component of vertical infection prevention for Medeiros is active surveillance testing,

1243
02:01:01,840 --> 02:01:07,479
and this is where you're really purposely going out to try to find out who in your hospital

1244
02:01:07,480 --> 02:01:13,570
is colonized but doesn't have an infection with a particular antibiotic resistant organism.

1245
02:01:14,650 --> 02:01:22,630
And so this is typically done by collecting samples, and you can either do molecular screening or culture based screening.

1246
02:01:22,990 --> 02:01:27,160
And for Mersa, this is where knowing where the reservoirs are are important.

1247
02:01:27,550 --> 02:01:37,810
If you were to screen for Mersa doing a dry swab of the external kind of the opening of the nose in areas is the most common.

1248
02:01:37,810 --> 02:01:43,959
And if you need to increase your sensitivity, you can also get swabs from the axilla or the groin for very.

1249
02:01:43,960 --> 02:01:50,260
It's a rectal sample. Very rectal sample. And the same for multidrug resistant gram negatives.

1250
02:01:50,680 --> 02:01:54,160
For Candida auris, it's the axilla in the groin.

1251
02:01:55,570 --> 02:02:02,350
As we talked about, clinical cultures identify only a small proportion of colonized patients with antibiotic resistant organisms.

1252
02:02:03,010 --> 02:02:07,480
But asymptomatic carriers may play a role in patient to patient transmission.

1253
02:02:08,500 --> 02:02:15,700
But we don't just do this to no, necessarily, although you might just want to know what your asymptomatic colonization rate is,

1254
02:02:16,030 --> 02:02:23,080
but you wouldn't necessarily do that forever. You might do that for a prevalence sample or in an outbreak, etc.

1255
02:02:23,470 --> 02:02:28,530
But these results really then lead to an intervention, and that intervention could be contact precaution,

1256
02:02:28,540 --> 02:02:33,100
isolation if you're colonized or some decolonization procedure.

1257
02:02:34,690 --> 02:02:40,300
So an example of a decolonization procedure for is for IRSA.

1258
02:02:40,600 --> 02:02:47,260
And we know that if we try to eradicate Mersa in the nose, in the skin, maybe in the GI tract,

1259
02:02:47,560 --> 02:02:53,980
we can decrease the risk of MRSA, carriage transmission and infection in individual patients.

1260
02:02:54,460 --> 02:02:59,740
And we can do this by using an intranasal antiseptic because we know the staff hangs out in the nose,

1261
02:03:00,340 --> 02:03:05,620
a classically that's fairly new person and but there is data now and just pop

1262
02:03:05,620 --> 02:03:10,360
it on iodine in the nose and there products that are available to do that.

1263
02:03:10,960 --> 02:03:15,640
We also use topical antiseptics on the skin with chlorhexidine.

1264
02:03:15,640 --> 02:03:21,010
That's an antiseptic that will kill staff and also other bacteria on the skin.

1265
02:03:21,460 --> 02:03:29,170
And then in some cases for patients who have persistent colonization results in infection, we'll use systemic antibiotics as well.

1266
02:03:30,340 --> 02:03:35,650
And this decolonization can either be targeted just to people, you know, to be colonized with Mersa,

1267
02:03:36,100 --> 02:03:41,440
or you could do it universally to a specific population like all ICU patients.

1268
02:03:44,310 --> 02:03:47,670
So that all sounds great.

1269
02:03:47,790 --> 02:03:55,530
It's pretty labor intensive and there's a lot of mixed evidence on contact precautions, particularly for Mersa.

1270
02:03:56,760 --> 02:04:02,040
And there is evidence that contact precautions are effective, particularly for outbreak control.

1271
02:04:02,250 --> 02:04:09,120
So if you're in a neonatal ICU and you have several neonates who have developed during that time period,

1272
02:04:09,810 --> 02:04:15,360
you may wish to put contact precautions as part of your response to an outbreak.

1273
02:04:15,360 --> 02:04:24,150
And we know that that's an effective component of response. We also know that those who are really focused on preventing one organism can do it.

1274
02:04:24,360 --> 02:04:30,570
So in the Netherlands, they have a very low like 2% or so rate in their hospitals.

1275
02:04:31,830 --> 02:04:41,430
And they do this by screening everybody who comes into a hospital for putting people preemptively in contact precautions if they're at risk.

1276
02:04:41,430 --> 02:04:44,610
So not waiting for the results to come back preemptively.

1277
02:04:44,610 --> 02:04:48,320
At risk could include anybody who's lived in the United States.

1278
02:04:48,330 --> 02:04:53,040
We're all at risk. So if we get hospitalized in the Netherlands, we would go to contact precautions.

1279
02:04:53,040 --> 02:04:54,960
And so they probably are not an immersive carrier.

1280
02:04:56,250 --> 02:05:01,350
And so that's an effective approach, but it doesn't really do much for the rest of the organisms that might be at risk.

1281
02:05:02,310 --> 02:05:09,240
There are some good studies that show that if you combine contact precautions with active surveillance and ICU use,

1282
02:05:09,600 --> 02:05:17,220
this can impact immersive activities and active surveillance with contact precautions.

1283
02:05:17,370 --> 02:05:21,390
And decolonization can also decrease MRSA disease.

1284
02:05:23,300 --> 02:05:27,440
But there are also, on the flip side, evidence that contact precautions aren't effective.

1285
02:05:28,220 --> 02:05:33,799
So if you were to screen all surgical patients and those who are positive,

1286
02:05:33,800 --> 02:05:37,850
put them in contact precautions, decolonize them, adjust their perioperative antibiotics.

1287
02:05:39,050 --> 02:05:44,240
There was at least in this large study, there was no difference in health care associated mersa infections.

1288
02:05:44,870 --> 02:05:51,019
If you do that specifically for a very small population of those who are getting cardiac surgery,

1289
02:05:51,020 --> 02:05:54,470
for instance, there's some good data that maybe it's effective just in cardiac surgery.

1290
02:05:56,090 --> 02:06:01,160
And then lastly, there's a lot of empiric experimentation that goes on in hospitals.

1291
02:06:01,640 --> 02:06:08,630
And so a meta analysis looking at hospitals who who were doing contact precautions for Mersa and then stopped

1292
02:06:08,960 --> 02:06:15,740
and looked before after a at trends before after have generally not seen an increase in infection rates.

1293
02:06:17,180 --> 02:06:18,709
So the evidence is mixed.

1294
02:06:18,710 --> 02:06:25,540
And for this it really requires hospital epidemiologists, infection prevention departments to really look and think about, you know,

1295
02:06:25,610 --> 02:06:34,520
what are their most urgent patient safety issues and what can they reasonably accomplish and follow data to change if if the need be.

1296
02:06:35,990 --> 02:06:39,560
And one of the problems with contact precautions is compliance.

1297
02:06:39,770 --> 02:06:44,240
So people are busy in health care. You know, the problems with compliance, with hand hygiene,

1298
02:06:44,650 --> 02:06:51,770
I can imagine that that's difficult for people to take the time to put on their gowns, put on their gloves and do it correctly.

1299
02:06:52,220 --> 02:07:00,200
And so Dr. Stoneman Ashley was involved in the study where there were 11 teaching hospitals that did observations of contact precautions, compliance,

1300
02:07:00,590 --> 02:07:04,249
and they looked at lots of things and they found that in general, it was about an 80,

1301
02:07:04,250 --> 02:07:09,140
70, 80% compliance with the basics of putting on the golden glove.

1302
02:07:10,010 --> 02:07:16,430
But the other important parts were very good. So people didn't wash their hands before putting on the gowns and gloves.

1303
02:07:17,750 --> 02:07:20,090
That was the major thing. And they didn't always do it after.

1304
02:07:20,630 --> 02:07:26,060
And and so certainly, you know, you can contaminate gloves when you're putting them on your hands.

1305
02:07:26,870 --> 02:07:33,200
So you want to have clean hands when you put them on. And when you're taking them off, it's very easy to contaminate your hands as well.

1306
02:07:33,230 --> 02:07:37,640
So that's a really important part, is that that that if you're not focused on this,

1307
02:07:37,910 --> 02:07:44,210
if you have a lot of people in contact precautions, you may really have a detrimental effect on your hand hygiene.

1308
02:07:45,090 --> 02:07:48,530
And if you have lots of people, it's a burden of isolation increase.

1309
02:07:49,700 --> 02:07:54,320
There was a decrease in compliance. People kind of just see it as while paper they don't find is important.

1310
02:07:55,130 --> 02:08:06,290
And then research done by Sarah Crane, who's one of our nursing researchers, really has found very poor technique of taking out and putting off PPE.

1311
02:08:08,300 --> 02:08:11,780
And then, you know, there's some other downsides to contact precautions.

1312
02:08:12,260 --> 02:08:20,240
And we think that we're making this a safe environment for patients, but maybe there's causing some unintended consequences.

1313
02:08:20,690 --> 02:08:25,099
And so this is just a study that Dr. Saint, also at the University of Michigan, did a long time ago,

1314
02:08:25,100 --> 02:08:32,810
and he found that patients who were in contact precautions were less likely to be physically seen or examined by the attending physician.

1315
02:08:33,950 --> 02:08:39,019
This is a little bit surprising to me because I think that things have changed where that's really required.

1316
02:08:39,020 --> 02:08:42,260
But in those days, that was the case.

1317
02:08:42,950 --> 02:08:47,629
But also, isolated patients were often had a higher risk of other adverse events.

1318
02:08:47,630 --> 02:08:52,130
And what kind of things might go on if someone in contact precautions takes time to get in there?

1319
02:08:52,460 --> 02:08:59,600
What kinds of things do you think could happen to patients in the hospital if if we put barriers between the patient and the health care worker?

1320
02:09:04,700 --> 02:09:09,569
But the health care worker might be reluctant to go into the room as frequently.

1321
02:09:09,570 --> 02:09:15,650
And so they might miss important signs that an event might be about to happen.

1322
02:09:15,920 --> 02:09:19,190
Yeah. So somebody might be getting ill and people aren't really on top of it.

1323
02:09:19,970 --> 02:09:24,980
Yeah, that's that's definitely true. And some of those important events really are things like falls.

1324
02:09:26,690 --> 02:09:30,350
And so patients get up when they shouldn't be, they can fall.

1325
02:09:31,220 --> 02:09:34,790
And then I think that that's a bit that's a big one,

1326
02:09:35,420 --> 02:09:40,820
but they're more likely not to have their vital signs recorded, which could certainly impact how we look at them.

1327
02:09:41,720 --> 02:09:44,870
And there's lots of different things about that. And it's true.

1328
02:09:44,870 --> 02:09:50,510
I mean, and I'll say contact precautions, not so much, but in the special pathogens precautions world,

1329
02:09:51,230 --> 02:09:53,600
when I'm around, I'm going to have 20 patients to see.

1330
02:09:54,320 --> 02:10:04,520
I'll probably put the patient that I've got to put on a 95, my masks, my girls, my gloves last on my list is I got to do it at the end.

1331
02:10:04,880 --> 02:10:12,590
I may not do it with my whole team. And so and I'll probably be in there for a shorter period of time because I'm uncomfortable.

1332
02:10:13,040 --> 02:10:18,949
So so I think it's really you have to really think about all of these things as important

1333
02:10:18,950 --> 02:10:23,420
contributors when we make decisions to put patients in transmission based precautions.

1334
02:10:24,710 --> 02:10:28,040
It's utterly costly. Costs money. Yeah.

1335
02:10:28,320 --> 02:10:31,910
And, you know, there's all the waste that's associated with it.

1336
02:10:33,050 --> 02:10:37,770
Yeah, lots of waste to waste. Yeah. I mean, it really is a mixed bag.

1337
02:10:37,880 --> 02:10:45,050
Yeah. So in our hospital, we use contact precautions for the gram negative resistant organisms.

1338
02:10:46,010 --> 02:10:50,030
We definitely would use them for Candida Auris because it's an emerging pathogen.

1339
02:10:50,420 --> 02:10:54,560
But some of our what we would call endemic organisms, where we already have a lot,

1340
02:10:54,590 --> 02:11:00,050
we really rely not on contact precautions, but on these horizontal infection prevention strategies.

1341
02:11:00,560 --> 02:11:06,770
So I'll remind you again, these horizontal infection prevention strategies are meant to target all infections,

1342
02:11:07,280 --> 02:11:14,030
resistance and sensitive infections, hand hygiene, the evidence based insertion and care of devices.

1343
02:11:14,170 --> 02:11:20,000
Talk about chlorhexidine bathing again in this regard, environmental cleaning and antimicrobial stewardship.

1344
02:11:20,540 --> 02:11:24,499
For much of these things, you've had other lectures about it, so I'm not going to go into detail,

1345
02:11:24,500 --> 02:11:28,520
but I just wanted to put them in context of how they fit into the area of prevention.

1346
02:11:29,330 --> 02:11:38,330
So this is a reminder of the five moments of hand hygiene by the World Health Organization before touching a patient, before a clean,

1347
02:11:38,330 --> 02:11:45,200
aseptic procedure, after touching bodily fluids, after touching a patient, and after touching the patient's surroundings.

1348
02:11:45,470 --> 02:11:53,300
So a lot of times to wash your hands. But so we measure hand hygiene compliance for World Health Organization moments

1349
02:11:53,510 --> 02:11:59,210
one and I guess five because we do before in and out of the patient's room.

1350
02:11:59,810 --> 02:12:02,810
And you can see that in 2015.

1351
02:12:02,810 --> 02:12:05,990
And if we went back to 2014, I can show you even worse numbers.

1352
02:12:05,990 --> 02:12:13,549
But in 2015 only, it was a coin flip whether people were going to wash their hands, coming in and out of patient's rooms.

1353
02:12:13,550 --> 02:12:20,780
And that was unacceptable. If we really needed to rely upon this as the base of our pyramid in a horizontal infection prevention strategies.

1354
02:12:20,780 --> 02:12:26,930
And it took us years, but a lot of work and improvement. But we've got to above 95%.

1355
02:12:27,350 --> 02:12:32,570
That's our goal and it's really 100%. But our observation goal is greater than 95%.

1356
02:12:32,930 --> 02:12:37,850
We saw some decline over Coban when we stopped measuring and now we're back up again.

1357
02:12:40,130 --> 02:12:46,459
And I know you guys had, you know, about some of the difficulties with contact precaution, observation and eye contact precautions,

1358
02:12:46,460 --> 02:12:54,170
but hand hygiene observations, because you've had an opportunity to do that, I'll just comment upon the prevention of device related infections.

1359
02:12:54,170 --> 02:12:59,930
So if you can prevent an infection, you can prevent antibiotic resistant infections.

1360
02:13:00,320 --> 02:13:09,590
And so this is just an example of the falling rates of collapses over time, which is a national and international phenomenon.

1361
02:13:10,730 --> 02:13:17,810
And on the bottom you'll see the pink, which is MSA Clancy, which decreased over time.

1362
02:13:18,050 --> 02:13:24,110
You'll see MRSA classes decreased over time. And that's just really looking at trying to prevent device related infections.

1363
02:13:24,470 --> 02:13:31,460
If, however, you looked and said, well, what about the percentage of staph aureus infections,

1364
02:13:31,610 --> 02:13:37,580
you actually see an increase over time of the percentage of staff or infections that are MRSA.

1365
02:13:38,060 --> 02:13:44,690
So it's really important what you're trying to accomplish and really it's decreasing overall patient harm that we're trying to accomplish.

1366
02:13:46,550 --> 02:13:53,600
So chlorhexidine gluconate, we call it CSG is also another horizontal infection strategy.

1367
02:13:54,170 --> 02:13:57,170
I talked to you a bit about it for decolonization with the versa.

1368
02:13:57,890 --> 02:14:02,180
And when we put it on the skin, it decreases the burden of mersa on the skin.

1369
02:14:02,420 --> 02:14:06,889
But it also is it is a broad antiseptic so it can decrease.

1370
02:14:06,890 --> 02:14:15,380
And rackauckas in the skin, which I told you was the fecal patina, it can decrease staph aureus on the skin, candida auris on the skin and others.

1371
02:14:15,950 --> 02:14:22,159
And so there are there's good data that daily bathing with chlorhexidine leads to significant reductions of the

1372
02:14:22,160 --> 02:14:27,890
risk for acquisition of these antibiotic resistant organisms and health care associated bloodstream infections.

1373
02:14:28,760 --> 02:14:34,010
And it decreases the risk to the individual patient because they have less bacteria on their skin,

1374
02:14:34,340 --> 02:14:39,740
less likelihood that there's some of this bacteria is going to get introduced into their central line or other devices.

1375
02:14:40,400 --> 02:14:44,690
But it also decreases contamination of the health care workers hands in the environment

1376
02:14:44,870 --> 02:14:50,000
and therefore can impact the spread to other people in the unit or hospital.

1377
02:14:51,560 --> 02:14:55,340
And this is just looking at we're going to move on to cleaning the environment.

1378
02:14:55,340 --> 02:14:57,710
And you may have seen pictures like this before,

1379
02:14:58,010 --> 02:15:06,440
but if you culture a room that a patient's been in before cleaning it, you can find lots of bacteria everywhere.

1380
02:15:06,800 --> 02:15:14,210
And if there's resistant bacteria, the patient has a resistant bacteria or the prior patient has a resistant bacteria, you'll find that as well.

1381
02:15:17,180 --> 02:15:23,020
And these bacteria, they live for a long time. And it's surprising, actually.

1382
02:15:23,030 --> 02:15:26,730
But Acinetobacter. R can live for months in the health care environment.

1383
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:28,820
C difficile can live for a long time.

1384
02:15:28,830 --> 02:15:37,050
These are really hardy organisms and they look you can look and see the ranges that you see for some of these other organisms as well.

1385
02:15:39,090 --> 02:15:47,220
So we need to clean the rooms. We need to clean the surfaces. We need to clean them with effective and and disinfectants and cleaners.

1386
02:15:47,310 --> 02:15:54,210
We've learned about that in your environmental cleaning product talks, and you probably learned about some of the ways to monitor,

1387
02:15:54,360 --> 02:16:01,380
as well as just reminding you about the UV marker, which is just looking for whether things that have been mechanically touched over time.

1388
02:16:01,710 --> 02:16:09,240
You may have talked about pros and cons of these as well. I talked about ATP bioluminescence, which is looking for organic material.

1389
02:16:09,300 --> 02:16:11,040
Whether it's alive or dead, doesn't matter.

1390
02:16:11,760 --> 02:16:17,820
And it's been used to track cleanliness of food prep surfaces and it's been used some in the health care environment as well.

1391
02:16:19,260 --> 02:16:29,160
And then because we are not perfect and our our disinfectants aren't perfect, our environmental services workers are not perfect.

1392
02:16:30,510 --> 02:16:40,139
We can have gaps in our cleaning. And so people have looked at no touch technologies to add on to physical cleaning of hospital rooms.

1393
02:16:40,140 --> 02:16:45,090
And one of those is ultraviolet light. These are just some of the pictures of what the machines look like.

1394
02:16:45,780 --> 02:16:52,410
And it's a uv-c light. It destroys microbial DNA and it can be used as an adjunct after traditional cleaning.

1395
02:16:52,500 --> 02:16:58,680
It decreases residual microorganisms and there is some clinical outcome data, but it's pretty limited on whether this is effective.

1396
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:03,870
It takes time. If you can't have the patient in the room while this is going on.

1397
02:17:04,860 --> 02:17:08,490
And so but it's helpful in some circumstances.

1398
02:17:09,150 --> 02:17:16,020
And then we actually use hydrogen peroxide vapor for this purpose and some of our antibiotic resistant organism rooms.

1399
02:17:16,860 --> 02:17:30,089
And basically, this is a vapor. So the room gets taped off, walled off, and the machine creates a vapor refreshment peroxide.

1400
02:17:30,090 --> 02:17:35,850
It goes everywhere, goes to the ceiling corners that they open up the drawers, it goes in the drawers, etc.

1401
02:17:36,690 --> 02:17:43,080
And so there's some actually more clinical data with the hydrogen peroxide vapor and that patients are less likely to acquire.

1402
02:17:43,370 --> 02:17:50,190
It was if the room was decontaminated with hydrogen peroxide vapor and particularly with organisms like VRD.

1403
02:17:50,910 --> 02:17:59,730
So I'm just going to have to stay empty. It's so it depends on the product that you use, but I think it's about 45 minutes of nothing.

1404
02:18:00,120 --> 02:18:05,070
It is, though, in the world. In our world is. But I mean I mean the world I remember it was 3 hours.

1405
02:18:05,330 --> 02:18:09,899
Yeah, it would be 24 hours. Oh, yeah. So there's different generations.

1406
02:18:09,900 --> 02:18:13,140
But it used to be the ones that we first had were like 3 hours.

1407
02:18:13,500 --> 02:18:17,190
And then I believe hours are like 45 minutes now. Yeah.

1408
02:18:19,150 --> 02:18:26,440
Yeah. I always worry that it means people feel like they don't have to clean as well because they have of that.

1409
02:18:26,890 --> 02:18:32,950
Yeah. And that's not true. That's not going to help when you actually have material that needs to be scrubbed off.

1410
02:18:33,020 --> 02:18:40,190
Yeah. If you've got a big gunk of something with a lot of bacteria in it getting on the outside of, it's not going to be particularly helpful.

1411
02:18:40,250 --> 02:18:45,790
It doesn't have to be this big. You can do. Yeah, yeah. Very tiny, but yes, yeah, yeah.

1412
02:18:46,150 --> 02:18:48,220
And then lastly, I think next week,

1413
02:18:48,400 --> 02:18:54,760
Doctor Patty is going to talk with you about antimicrobial stewardship and it's a really important horizontal infection prevention strategy.

1414
02:18:55,180 --> 02:19:00,399
And really that just means that we in health care want to ensure that appropriate

1415
02:19:00,400 --> 02:19:04,960
antimicrobials are used for the optimal selection of the the type of drug,

1416
02:19:05,110 --> 02:19:10,540
the dose and the duration. It's much more complicated than that when you kind of break it down, but that's the gist.

1417
02:19:11,020 --> 02:19:15,970
And we do this to improve patient outcomes and to reduce adverse events related to antimicrobials.

1418
02:19:16,330 --> 02:19:21,220
And it's been associated antimicrobial stewardship programs with decreased morbidity mortality,

1419
02:19:21,550 --> 02:19:29,530
decreased length of stay and some emerging evidence and in some situations of reducing or attenuating, advancing antimicrobial resistance.

1420
02:19:29,980 --> 02:19:32,650
And they actually pay for themselves for the most part.

1421
02:19:32,650 --> 02:19:40,570
So this is a good thing in health care if you can decrease health care expenditures while also improving morbidity and mortality.

1422
02:19:42,970 --> 02:19:45,250
So this is just leave you with this analogy.

1423
02:19:45,550 --> 02:19:52,570
So when we talk about the vertical versus the horizontal infection prevention for multi-drug resistant organisms,

1424
02:19:53,920 --> 02:20:03,340
we believe that infection control programs that focus only on one organism are unlikely to succeed because they may squeeze out the MRSA.

1425
02:20:03,340 --> 02:20:10,120
But then they've got to go look at very or some other antibiotic resistant organism that increases over time.

1426
02:20:11,560 --> 02:20:18,940
So it's my belief and I think a general belief that horizontal infection control interventions in

1427
02:20:18,940 --> 02:20:23,860
which all infections and any site are reduced are the backbone of the infection control approach.

1428
02:20:24,400 --> 02:20:31,990
But that targeted vertical intervention programs for specific MDR rules should be assessed to see if they have incremental value in your circumstance.

1429
02:20:32,800 --> 02:20:41,410
And emerging areas like carbapenem resistant bacteria series or Candida Auris really require an aggressive combined approach.

1430
02:20:42,580 --> 02:20:47,920
And that's all I have for you. I left you some extra slides with some of the literature that supports the contact

1431
02:20:47,920 --> 02:20:51,579
precautions stuff because it's actually pretty complicated for your purposes.

1432
02:20:51,580 --> 02:20:55,180
I think it's really just important to note that there's conflicting data.

1433
02:20:56,620 --> 02:20:57,610
So I have a question.

1434
02:20:57,620 --> 02:21:09,250
So like when I read about the chlorhexidine bans and stuff, I mean, it's kind of a mixed bag because, you know, it's not nice on your.

1435
02:21:09,260 --> 02:21:18,730
Yeah. And then we do know that there is a skin microbiome and so like if you take everything off then you're at risk of colonization.

1436
02:21:18,850 --> 02:21:22,629
Yeah. So I think yeah. So I think that's right.

1437
02:21:22,630 --> 02:21:27,790
And that's why it's not done for every patient in the hospital. And it's only done, you know, for acute.

1438
02:21:28,120 --> 02:21:31,149
And you guys, the long term care is looking at this too. So I think that's difficult.

1439
02:21:31,150 --> 02:21:36,430
But it's it's in our intensive care units where the risk benefit may be important.

1440
02:21:36,430 --> 02:21:44,110
And then those who have central lines are the other sort of group that that the data would support using and and yeah

1441
02:21:44,110 --> 02:21:52,659
we have worried about we saw an increase in in particular Canada just general Canada or East classes over time.

1442
02:21:52,660 --> 02:21:54,700
And there's lots of reasons that could be.

1443
02:21:54,700 --> 02:22:00,249
But we wondered whether they were chlorhexidine resistant, to be honest, and we were able to have our burn ICU lab,

1444
02:22:00,250 --> 02:22:04,959
actually urban lab that does a lot of microbial culturing kind of tests for that.

1445
02:22:04,960 --> 02:22:10,870
They they do culturing for sensitivity to topical antibiotics or they use for treating burns.

1446
02:22:10,870 --> 02:22:15,199
And we asked them to do it for chlorhexidine and we didn't see resistance sort of interesting.

1447
02:22:15,200 --> 02:22:20,589
It doesn't mean it didn't change that. But I seem to remember this is really all that.

1448
02:22:20,590 --> 02:22:25,000
There was like an outbreak in a neonatal intensive care unit associated for infections.

1449
02:22:25,750 --> 02:22:29,710
So those that outbreak was associated with contaminated chlorhexidine.

1450
02:22:30,460 --> 02:22:31,220
Yeah. Yeah.

1451
02:22:31,780 --> 02:22:41,259
So we see that from time to time that our infection control products are contaminated with some organism like Burkholderia or some bad, bad organism.

1452
02:22:41,260 --> 02:22:49,300
And so when we look at outbreaks of weird infections, we often look at pharmaceuticals and other products that could be involved.

1453
02:22:49,330 --> 02:22:52,870
Yeah, that was that was bad. Yeah.

1454
02:22:53,950 --> 02:22:58,330
Yeah. So that's that's that's an organism that is resistant, relatively resistant to chlorhexidine.

1455
02:23:00,020 --> 02:23:05,140
So that's a that's a potential downside, is that you have to look out for when you're doing these interventions.

1456
02:23:05,260 --> 02:23:08,919
So would you say as a general rule, when we think about doing the vertical approach,

1457
02:23:08,920 --> 02:23:12,489
like around an outbreak, for example, definitely around an outbreak.

1458
02:23:12,490 --> 02:23:18,610
And for emerging pathogens, once they become endemic, that's where the controversy starts and how you define.

1459
02:23:18,670 --> 02:23:26,470
Endemic like it's an also controversy, like how much you need to have or how long before you would call something kind of entrenched.

1460
02:23:27,430 --> 02:23:34,680
You know. So this question. Excellent.

1461
02:23:34,790 --> 02:23:39,980
Enjoy the weekend. I hear there's some stuff going on outside this big game.

1462
02:23:41,440 --> 02:23:47,420
This have 200,000 people coming. So let's review about the active surveillance for Facebook.

1463
02:23:48,050 --> 02:23:52,129
Yeah. So my feelings for this have gone, have evolved over time.

1464
02:23:52,130 --> 02:23:56,209
And so we we I think that we don't know the answer to this.

1465
02:23:56,210 --> 02:24:03,350
And I think that that active surveillance in a perfect world, combined with contact precautions or compliance,

1466
02:24:03,350 --> 02:24:08,420
was perfect, probably is effective for things like Amazon resistant Enterococcus.

1467
02:24:08,870 --> 02:24:13,309
But what we know is that we don't live in a perfect world and we have limited resources

1468
02:24:13,310 --> 02:24:18,260
for which to put put on our health care workers and our infection prevention departments.

1469
02:24:18,260 --> 02:24:22,909
And and so I'll tell you that what we've done and we'll have some of this information, I hope, pretty soon.

1470
02:24:22,910 --> 02:24:28,250
So we've done very active surveillance culturing for since, I think, 2008.

1471
02:24:29,210 --> 02:24:36,890
And we we stopped doing contact precautions in the middle of the pandemic because we didn't have enough gowns.

1472
02:24:37,310 --> 02:24:40,790
And so we had to make some judgments about where to use our gowns.

1473
02:24:41,330 --> 02:24:46,129
But we kept doing the surveillance culture and we're going to be stopping that pretty soon.

1474
02:24:46,130 --> 02:24:53,330
But the reason we did that is we wanted to see if we had if those contact precautions really changed our transmission at all.

1475
02:24:53,690 --> 02:24:57,560
And nobody's really done that in that way in the literature.

1476
02:24:58,100 --> 02:25:02,720
And one of our colleagues, Dr. Woods, in infectious diseases,

1477
02:25:03,050 --> 02:25:09,560
actually has many of those isolates and is looking at genetically whether you can look at that transmission as well.

1478
02:25:10,010 --> 02:25:16,820
So when we do infection prevention research and not me, but people who are doing infection prevention research,

1479
02:25:17,120 --> 02:25:22,489
it's messy because your laboratory is a hospital and we don't usually look just at nonintervention.

1480
02:25:22,490 --> 02:25:28,160
We look at a bundle of interventions and it becomes really hard to tease out what's the effective component.

1481
02:25:28,420 --> 02:25:32,960
Yeah, yeah. So we'll see. I mean, I think that different places do different things.

1482
02:25:34,070 --> 02:25:37,820
And if you go to one hospital, you may find that like the VA, for instance,

1483
02:25:37,820 --> 02:25:46,969
does a lot of versus screening and or is a contact precautions and feel like that kind of has left the bar in a long time.

1484
02:25:46,970 --> 02:25:48,740
Yeah. Yeah.

1485
02:25:48,860 --> 02:25:56,750
Well, these are lots of we have lots of conversations about this, so we don't put Mursi in isolation there unless someone has a yucky drippy wound.

1486
02:25:56,850 --> 02:26:01,390
So yeah. Questions. Awesome.

1487
02:26:01,660 --> 02:26:20,630
Well, thank you so much. Yeah, no problem. Thank you. The great thing for me in the literature which are a lot better than we do on the.

1488
02:26:24,750 --> 02:26:30,100
I've done it early for my work.

1489
02:26:30,150 --> 02:26:32,550
And then when I hear, I think.
