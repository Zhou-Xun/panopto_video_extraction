1
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:17,220
okay is everybody ready.

2
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:22,560
so we'll get started. so just have_to get apartment.

3
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:28,220
just curious. hi this is me here. it wasn't even a term that was. so

4
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:33,780
I'm here you have for

5
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:39,840
half or so. everybody know what it is or isn't covered in another course.

6
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,280
I know Lisa couple of you and postings on the Arkansas foresight.

7
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,700
I have had some have some practical experience somebody did some

8
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:57,500
in Ann_Arbor. you can up know that.

9
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:05,207
so anyway I think it's a great topic because it really

10
00:01:05,207 --> 00:01:11,367
encompasses our familiarity with everything that we experience

11
00:01:11,367 --> 00:01:16,467
from day to day. I assume you don't live in the wilderness. but it puts in a completely different

12
00:01:16,467 --> 00:01:22,187
frame or contacts so was all familiar stuff. but perceive now in a different

13
00:01:22,187 --> 00:01:27,687
in different context or different. you know you you frame. topics and this is a new.

14
00:01:27,687 --> 00:01:32,687
what I think of us a re framing. so. so it's really fascinating

15
00:01:32,687 --> 00:01:38,527
please jump in if you have questions or if you have your own personal experiences.

16
00:01:38,527 --> 00:01:43,567
they didn't need me this in school. so we're sort of in exploring this

17
00:01:43,567 --> 00:01:48,587
to some extent together. but if you have had some experience

18
00:01:48,587 --> 00:01:54,147
please. please try again. and and feel free to ask or contribute.

19
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:59,397
so the building environment is strictly speaking everything that humans

20
00:01:59,397 --> 00:02:05,237
make that we'd experience in terms of where we live where we work where we play

21
00:02:05,237 --> 00:02:10,357
again. except for wilderness experiences

22
00:02:10,357 --> 00:02:15,937
which is not the built environment to totally national government. it encompasses everything

23
00:02:15,937 --> 00:02:20,977
and so and the second bullet is really

24
00:02:20,977 --> 00:02:26,037
kind of a critical concept and that is. and it's something that is still being

25
00:02:26,037 --> 00:02:31,617
explored and is to a large extent. really much of the science

26
00:02:31,617 --> 00:02:36,797
is really. so in the same sentence. talking about shift

27
00:02:36,797 --> 00:02:42,197
work in association with various diseases. a_lot_of the research and build environment.

28
00:02:42,197 --> 00:02:47,257
with respect to help using this contingency and a_lot_of the research is not

29
00:02:47,257 --> 00:02:52,277
very robots show concept that was that just the way

30
00:02:52,277 --> 00:02:57,537
this room is designed to determine how we interact. so that's good. absolutely

31
00:02:57,537 --> 00:03:02,545
ideas Bolton Berman's where we live. how we get to

32
00:03:02,545 --> 00:03:07,665
where we go and so forth. can did turn into about our

33
00:03:07,665 --> 00:03:12,785
own individual health. so that sort of it and capture

34
00:03:12,785 --> 00:03:18,085
leads. the whole concept. so in terms of the built environment there. there's everything

35
00:03:18,085 --> 00:03:23,125
from whatever used to reach the board to a very large scale. so

36
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:28,645
it's a very very Broadway looking at a whole range of potential

37
00:03:28,645 --> 00:03:33,765
issues from Micro to the macro. the entire

38
00:03:33,765 --> 00:03:38,765
city. and that your week. so it's not only structured

39
00:03:38,765 --> 00:03:43,885
the physical structures with some of the structures have processes so there is transportation system.

40
00:03:43,885 --> 00:03:49,365
so it's not only the fact that there are real lines that you're versus our city

41
00:03:49,365 --> 00:03:54,705
and create physical garments but it's also a process for

42
00:03:54,705 --> 00:03:59,985
removing people moving freight and so forth it incorporates the idea of architecture

43
00:03:59,985 --> 00:04:05,645
and planning. end of course as you all well known your parks in

44
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:10,685
these building garments that was written for Ms. Parks like Central Park and so forth.

45
00:04:10,685 --> 00:04:16,265
the fact given the opportunity for some experience with nature in the human made

46
00:04:16,265 --> 00:04:21,525
environment. so can you another way of sort of

47
00:04:21,525 --> 00:04:27,525
flipping or expanding the concept of environmental health. so traditionally

48
00:04:27,525 --> 00:04:32,805
in the days. Rachel Carson wrote the book science framing probably

49
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:38,245
somewhere with it was what toxins are toxic and we exposed

50
00:04:38,245 --> 00:04:43,305
to chickenpox fuel period. help fix the lead in change.

51
00:04:43,305 --> 00:04:48,485
for example and lead poisoning. by that route. and

52
00:04:48,485 --> 00:04:53,625
so we talked about seventh in the field of the round of toxicology. the metal

53
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:58,939
Solomon's persistent organic pollutants all these kinds of things Dan we're supposed

54
00:04:58,939 --> 00:05:04,639
to do bad things to us. they don't do anything good. I just do bad things to us.

55
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:10,639
so that's historically. call me regarding environmental health and when I was a student here.

56
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:15,739
both in the seventies and then my residency not facial medicine in the eighties.

57
00:05:15,739 --> 00:05:22,099
that was the focus in terms of. so thank you to see

58
00:05:22,099 --> 00:05:27,399
a couple of important changes are returning to turn

59
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:32,459
in still changing this and one was the idea that they were buildings because

60
00:05:32,459 --> 00:05:37,559
of the energy crisis. high buildings and then before long we get the term six building syndrome.

61
00:05:37,559 --> 00:05:43,919
you can get sick from being in the house or building. that was too airtight and

62
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:49,039
mostly pollutants generated in doors are now. you're now exposed to

63
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:54,299
and then also was in vertical justice movement. and if you've been around campus

64
00:05:54,299 --> 00:05:59,615
for a_while you maybe familiar with the name Bonnie and Brian school resources

65
00:05:59,615 --> 00:06:04,815
in firm and he was really one of the leaders in developing the few environment

66
00:06:04,815 --> 00:06:11,075
for justice and that concept was that there were disadvantaged populations.

67
00:06:11,075 --> 00:06:16,075
because of where they live. maybe where they were. mostly where they lived near hazardous

68
00:06:16,075 --> 00:06:21,195
waste sites and test your plants and other than just

69
00:06:21,195 --> 00:06:27,035
horrible areas of the built environment. to no concept is

70
00:06:27,035 --> 00:06:32,475
not just exposures to toxins toxic and some so forth. but

71
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:37,693
two environments were brought in the concept cancel. there

72
00:06:37,693 --> 00:06:42,913
is no progress in our we're talking about. not us. this is Vantage population in certain

73
00:06:42,913 --> 00:06:47,953
areas of the city. but other things as well. in fact

74
00:06:47,953 --> 00:06:53,233
so in the last few decades. with

75
00:06:53,233 --> 00:06:58,273
the obesity epidemic. researchers are looking into

76
00:06:58,273 --> 00:07:03,533
possible factors and they start looking at the built environment and use it the built

77
00:07:03,533 --> 00:07:08,733
environment. it's permanent suit that neighborhood that doesn't have sidewalks

78
00:07:08,733 --> 00:07:13,733
that you seen in residential areas to use. we are between the turn in and

79
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:18,893
there's no side of additional place for people to walk. just they have an impact is that mean that people don't

80
00:07:18,893 --> 00:07:24,093
walk as much in there for the drive even half mile down to go to the store.

81
00:07:24,093 --> 00:07:29,573
instead of walk. so are those factors important in terms of

82
00:07:29,573 --> 00:07:34,900
determining whether people are are overweight

83
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:40,320
it's interesting suit. there there's two readings. they're actually both from the same person Howard from Ken.

84
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:45,680
one is sort of a text book chapter about the built environment which

85
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,760
I came Leslie. I wrote a_lot_of information from for this. you know who is

86
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:55,900
this patient I have editorial that he offered for an issue

87
00:07:55,900 --> 00:08:01,540
of our of environmental health perspectives. they had multiple articles about the growth environment.

88
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:06,540
this is re re selected as a patient here if you can get through. you know in a matter of minutes.

89
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:12,040
really kinda captures a_lot_of what this is all about.

90
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:18,100
and in particular in particular that in equity

91
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:23,160
in social justice issues.. so this is. it's a good article

92
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:28,520
and it will reinforce the stuff were talking about. looking for information from this.

93
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:33,880
I found this really fascinating there. seven founders of the American Public Health Association

94
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:39,832
A P H eight eight eighteen seventy two including architect in the housing specialist.

95
00:08:39,832 --> 00:08:45,152
so back in the eighteen seventies. they working to roll to forming. the Milton

96
00:08:45,152 --> 00:08:50,752
Public Health Association. and only now. now meeting in recent

97
00:08:50,752 --> 00:08:55,772
years of decades. are we re discovering the importance of forming planning

98
00:08:55,772 --> 00:09:01,412
landscape architecture and so forth. in terms of the built environment

99
00:09:01,412 --> 00:09:06,532
and creating environment that both don't have it. create negative impact

100
00:09:06,532 --> 00:09:11,992
but maybe even on the flip side. have a positive outcomes.

101
00:09:11,992 --> 00:09:17,492
so and that kinda can at this other concept that I think is really fascinating.

102
00:09:17,492 --> 00:09:22,692
so give her just talking about legs and Solomon's and so

103
00:09:22,692 --> 00:09:28,132
forth. we're talking about preventing illness from being poisoned right.

104
00:09:28,132 --> 00:09:33,132
the flip side. is can we create apartments that not only keeps us from getting

105
00:09:33,132 --> 00:09:38,240
you know but actually improve health. so it kinda reminds me of there's

106
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,360
a song from the forties. I. I was in the library by

107
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,380
processing the song. extension wait the positive. so it. anyway we're still sent

108
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:53,780
with the positive and eliminate the negatives and watch out for Mister in between.

109
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:59,020
but in this case we're talking about eliminating the negatives meeting. those exposures

110
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:04,080
in the environment that can harm you. while you were situated in the positive

111
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:09,220
meaning you're creating an environment and actually you can have a positive impact

112
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:14,600
on health. so it's totally different than avoiding toxins and toxic

113
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:19,660
and it's right and then as I see here that integrates all these various kinds

114
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:24,940
of the fax. lots of outcomes are not talking about just getting

115
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:29,940
you know an e-mail from less exposure. we're

116
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:36,193
talking about. not only physical health maybe weight loss psychological

117
00:10:36,193 --> 00:10:41,313
health and well being physical activity and so forth. so it's really. again it's

118
00:10:41,313 --> 00:10:47,273
a different framework different context for looking at something

119
00:10:47,273 --> 00:10:53,153
to tell you. think about it. you know you experienced all these things without

120
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:58,873
understanding their impact.

121
00:10:58,873 --> 00:11:03,873
so this is what I just said about it being a different framework where there's eliminating the

122
00:11:03,873 --> 00:11:09,013
negative extenuating. so there is a very small

123
00:11:09,013 --> 00:11:14,513
scale tools and so forth that's the area that we're gonna Alex. I'm

124
00:11:14,513 --> 00:11:20,113
mechanics not something that is typically dealt with and with in the scheme

125
00:11:20,113 --> 00:11:25,133
of the built environment. more probably that's the topic

126
00:11:25,133 --> 00:11:30,353
here. but also Gordy mentioned in the way this room is

127
00:11:30,353 --> 00:11:35,533
design. there's his physical separation I had to stand here to make sure the microphone

128
00:11:35,533 --> 00:11:40,838
gets picked up my voice and I can operate the keyboard or I could use I have_to stick

129
00:11:40,838 --> 00:11:45,918
around here for an hour. this physical separation which I think is a little bit weird.

130
00:11:45,918 --> 00:11:51,298
you know it is it's crazy. this physical barrier to interaction. a big class

131
00:11:51,298 --> 00:11:56,418
and it's a little hard in a wreck anyway but just is just another example immediate example

132
00:11:56,418 --> 00:12:01,578
of how the structure within the building can determine social interaction. I

133
00:12:01,578 --> 00:12:06,618
know somebody who has the opportunity to visit the Walt Disney Studios and they had a new

134
00:12:06,618 --> 00:12:12,658
building that was constructed. so that people from different disciplines

135
00:12:12,658 --> 00:12:17,658
in. so hurry do that. when you have different departments but to get to

136
00:12:17,658 --> 00:12:22,738
the water cooler or the lunch place for the bathroom. you all had to converge on the same

137
00:12:22,738 --> 00:12:28,078
hall way. so just a bad idea. building structure

138
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:33,498
designing the interior of the building to Foster interaction.

139
00:12:33,498 --> 00:12:38,558
could you could easily do it and just have people quite separate. every little pot. so on

140
00:12:38,558 --> 00:12:43,622
bathroom or lunch area or something like that so

141
00:12:43,622 --> 00:12:49,022
and with respect to buildings there's all these other features. the lighting temperature humidity noise air quality

142
00:12:49,022 --> 00:12:54,342
and so forth. and it is important to think about

143
00:12:54,342 --> 00:12:59,442
this last blue sack. many injuries occurred in the home environment

144
00:12:59,442 --> 00:13:04,442
and firms trips and falls and so forth

145
00:13:04,442 --> 00:13:10,162
and so that's a difficult problem to address but

146
00:13:10,162 --> 00:13:15,718
especially with the existing infrastructure for with new building there are opportunities for architects

147
00:13:15,718 --> 00:13:20,738
to incorporate concepts that might help prevent injuries at

148
00:13:20,738 --> 00:13:26,018
home. so the largest Kia

149
00:13:26,018 --> 00:13:32,098
in before and it was for all the Mercedes. we're trying to been apparently

150
00:13:32,098 --> 00:13:37,658
livable because they were intensely populated with us

151
00:13:37,658 --> 00:13:42,958
and this concept is important to us. the idea of land use mix.

152
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:48,018
so that was in a very small area of the city. you had where people live. you have

153
00:13:48,018 --> 00:13:53,398
stories to you have places where you can buy whatever you need as opposed

154
00:13:53,398 --> 00:13:58,578
to it's. where you have some connections extra rooms where you can go

155
00:13:58,578 --> 00:14:03,678
for miles and all of our houses but there's nothing to buy. you can. you can shop for

156
00:14:03,678 --> 00:14:08,878
food and so this now creates a

157
00:14:08,878 --> 00:14:14,027
red in the header genius mix plans uses Steve no for

158
00:14:14,027 --> 00:14:19,367
people to get in their car to go. three miles to by bill.

159
00:14:19,367 --> 00:14:24,807
instead of walking to the corner and in buying it. and

160
00:14:24,807 --> 00:14:30,127
so the difference between active transportation. where you use your own physical

161
00:14:30,127 --> 00:14:35,567
energy. I walking or bicycling. bicycle in for example to pass of transportation

162
00:14:35,567 --> 00:14:42,107
where you sit in your car and let the gasoline and energize your your transport.

163
00:14:42,107 --> 00:14:47,407
seating with running in a bus. so there's just contact the concept

164
00:14:47,407 --> 00:14:52,807
of making sure that there is still an opportunity to interact with nature

165
00:14:52,807 --> 00:14:57,867
within the built environment. so this term has people file for Leah. Celia

166
00:14:57,867 --> 00:15:03,647
is in Philadelphia the said you probably love. so feel you been slow in Bio Life.

167
00:15:03,647 --> 00:15:09,247
close this definition you lately emotional affiliation with human beings to other living organizms

168
00:15:09,247 --> 00:15:14,321
plants in the natural settings and so forth and so not

169
00:15:14,321 --> 00:15:19,461
just like you could say you five for Leah this manifest in your life for your

170
00:15:19,461 --> 00:15:24,561
your your daughter for your Capital also the natural world. you

171
00:15:24,561 --> 00:15:30,301
can interact with and without interaction with the natural world.

172
00:15:30,301 --> 00:15:35,621
the research is suggesting in supporting this idea that you can improve mental

173
00:15:35,621 --> 00:15:40,921
well being and including your ability to concentrate. copy of the ability and so forth.

174
00:15:40,921 --> 00:15:46,141
so I've got a friend colleague in the status station and she is part

175
00:15:46,141 --> 00:15:51,641
of this and to project here. anybody heard of M Q. so the university is

176
00:15:51,641 --> 00:15:56,741
financing the enter disciplinary research projects you have table base.

177
00:15:56,741 --> 00:16:01,881
excuse me at least three different disciplines represented itself. so my calling

178
00:16:01,881 --> 00:16:07,001
is the status station. my friend I collaborated with someone from there for

179
00:16:07,001 --> 00:16:12,317
resources and from the Medical School and may have developed an app

180
00:16:12,317 --> 00:16:18,437
and you get a prescription to go out to the Arboretum or something like that. you can actually take a picture

181
00:16:18,437 --> 00:16:23,657
that can be analyzed to determine the extent to which you are experiencing

182
00:16:23,657 --> 00:16:28,897
a natural environment. the telephone poles. I was in the picture or just trees and open fields

183
00:16:28,897 --> 00:16:34,417
and so forth. so they can actually their ways of taking these photographs

184
00:16:34,417 --> 00:16:39,557
and grading the degree of natural list of the environment

185
00:16:39,557 --> 00:16:44,997
and in this case they're starting the impact of these nature interventions.

186
00:16:44,997 --> 00:16:50,257
take a walk in the are on health and they're actually looking at cortisol

187
00:16:50,257 --> 00:16:55,677
as a measure of stress. one of the tension capacity well being

188
00:16:55,677 --> 00:17:01,437
self reports and so forth so very interesting study conducted here.

189
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:06,897
that is entirely within the Rome of this full concept of file for Leah.

190
00:17:06,897 --> 00:17:12,871
the built environment in this case. the benefits of experiencing danger

191
00:17:12,871 --> 00:17:17,911
so I'm on the same line. this is a

192
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:24,031
child. children Nature Network prescription. it says nature plain prescription

193
00:17:24,031 --> 00:17:29,091
and it's from this website children and teacher group of pediatricians develop

194
00:17:29,091 --> 00:17:34,271
this and so the idea is. it's skid steers. researchers suggest that

195
00:17:34,271 --> 00:17:39,391
if you're living in an area with nearby trees you have better. the same kinds of things and just talk

196
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:44,611
about attention. you better focus ability to manage your life

197
00:17:44,611 --> 00:17:49,751
problems and so forth. lower laws of aggression and violence. lower levels of report crime

198
00:17:49,751 --> 00:17:54,891
better self discipline and so forth so that the can

199
00:17:54,891 --> 00:18:00,031
be these kinds of impact. again. a_lot_of these are not

200
00:18:00,031 --> 00:18:06,751
definitively establish in terms of call nation but there's a_lot_of suggestions research.

201
00:18:06,751 --> 00:18:12,321
so so know the concept of physical activity certainly

202
00:18:12,321 --> 00:18:17,461
whether you engage in extra physical activity or try to maximize it or not

203
00:18:17,461 --> 00:18:22,721
it's a personal choice but it also is determined to. so I just learned

204
00:18:22,721 --> 00:18:27,941
from my father that when it's time to go to the store let's say and

205
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:33,241
it's a place to park rather and fishing around for the closest spot and sitting in your car and waiting and waiting

206
00:18:33,241 --> 00:18:38,301
and waiting for said to call the store. you go to the farthest parking spot and walk. okay.

207
00:18:38,301 --> 00:18:43,661
because when they maybe your door is not in your car which is when my father did.

208
00:18:43,661 --> 00:18:49,601
it's an opportunity to walk a little bit more. so and in fact this is a message

209
00:18:49,601 --> 00:18:55,341
exercise. our team looked through the day so if you have risk walk from the

210
00:18:55,341 --> 00:19:00,501
far parking lot and had seven minutes of risk walking to your day

211
00:19:00,501 --> 00:19:05,841
you've now. if you need that much more positive physical activity that is

212
00:19:05,841 --> 00:19:12,083
can be a possible benefit to your overall health. and so

213
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:17,283
so mentioned neighborhood is without side walks. is there trails available

214
00:19:17,283 --> 00:19:22,523
and so forth and a_lot_of these can determine how much physical activity you get involved in

215
00:19:22,523 --> 00:19:27,803
and I already mentioned this concept. so I have_to

216
00:19:27,803 --> 00:19:33,063
transport versus passive and

217
00:19:33,063 --> 00:19:38,843
how to design the layout. and planning. can affect

218
00:19:38,843 --> 00:19:44,443
that issue. so soon

219
00:19:44,443 --> 00:19:49,843
here. systematic review. looking at build environment and physical activity.

220
00:19:49,843 --> 00:19:55,551
hundred and sixty nine articles hey found. first of all that there's been a_lot more research

221
00:19:55,551 --> 00:20:00,671
lately. so any increase in articles one. one article because the starting

222
00:20:00,671 --> 00:20:05,731
physical activity in the built environment in two thousand one and in in ten years forty

223
00:20:05,731 --> 00:20:10,891
three articles. so a_lot more interest in starting this

224
00:20:10,891 --> 00:20:16,271
month a very important beneficial sucks but they're kinda lousy stories. they didn't really have reverse

225
00:20:16,271 --> 00:20:21,911
metrics for what is the city what is activity in when he started getting

226
00:20:21,911 --> 00:20:26,911
screwed nice thing. the rigger of the research and sort

227
00:20:26,911 --> 00:20:33,411
of the exposure in the fact how you're measuring it. let's have a positive relationship.

228
00:20:33,411 --> 00:20:38,471
so. so there's some intuitive sense that yes there's

229
00:20:38,471 --> 00:20:43,771
probably benefit. but they're still remains to be some

230
00:20:43,771 --> 00:20:49,111
more definitive research that would that would allow more

231
00:20:49,111 --> 00:20:55,130
of a causal conference regarding office of activities in the building burner.

232
00:20:55,130 --> 00:21:00,490
so most of this in this review most of the studies. virtually all in fact

233
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:05,630
use just simple observation of study designs and you know

234
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:10,790
you you read the end paragraph of the discussion of the research article almost

235
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:16,010
always says well we need more research right. and as part of what we what you learned

236
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:21,490
about in terms conference. regarding conversation that his repeat ability

237
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:27,070
to different researchers from different areas of different centers

238
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:32,470
using similar techniques. come up with the same results repeat ability.

239
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:37,490
obviously is is important. so don't apartment

240
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:43,750
with respect to walking. this is a review from two thousand eight at found.

241
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:49,110
this is all commonsense you know. so if there's more walking there places tomorrow

242
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:54,756
to right. if it's miles and miles before you get to anything besides.

243
00:21:54,756 --> 00:21:59,836
hey another house and you're not gonna be as likely to walk to get some

244
00:21:59,836 --> 00:22:04,976
place in that. also in folks this concept of

245
00:22:04,976 --> 00:22:10,076
explain use. you've got more things

246
00:22:10,076 --> 00:22:15,336
with more fax of uses within a certain area lending itself

247
00:22:15,336 --> 00:22:21,116
to more destinations and that also goes with higher density. so

248
00:22:21,116 --> 00:22:26,536
there's exchange tonight. I got to know this got your family quite well I spent some time in

249
00:22:26,536 --> 00:22:31,636
in the Netherlands and one of the family members lives in Amsterdam. anybody been

250
00:22:31,636 --> 00:22:36,716
in Amsterdam. most people know that what you doing in in the double

251
00:22:36,716 --> 00:22:42,456
and see ride a bike right. everybody rides a bike and. so this

252
00:22:42,456 --> 00:22:47,826
this friend lives in Amsterdam and where as I go shopping

253
00:22:47,826 --> 00:22:52,826
once a week for the food for the whole week. she stops on her walks home from

254
00:22:52,826 --> 00:22:58,086
work. took my suit in the market which is just a block from where she lives.

255
00:22:58,086 --> 00:23:03,586
so it's a whole different concept. you know also because

256
00:23:03,586 --> 00:23:09,146
of the density of the city and the highway

257
00:23:09,146 --> 00:23:14,386
headed to needy uses excuses. there's

258
00:23:14,386 --> 00:23:19,426
all these opportunities including just walking ticket to work to get home and

259
00:23:19,426 --> 00:23:24,706
so forth that are in this matter is available in United_States.

260
00:23:24,706 --> 00:23:29,906
so these are all are Carlos with walking. if there's a nice place to walk. you're more likely

261
00:23:29,906 --> 00:23:34,966
to walk then. if there's not. you got sidewalk to same place to walk to

262
00:23:34,966 --> 00:23:40,106
snap just you not less likely to walk in the street. and if you got little

263
00:23:40,106 --> 00:23:45,246
kid you not gonna ask them to walk in the street and they do have ways

264
00:23:45,246 --> 00:23:50,584
of metric supply to neighborhoods. this is to define walk

265
00:23:50,584 --> 00:23:55,604
ability which is probably some of. like I said

266
00:23:55,604 --> 00:24:00,644
whether there's a FedEx safe place to walk. so here's an interesting. I think I took

267
00:24:00,644 --> 00:24:05,644
it from the this text book chapter. that's part of your reading. just comparing the

268
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:10,864
percent of all city trips on the bicycle or foot compartment. in Zimmerman

269
00:24:10,864 --> 00:24:16,964
the US and you can see the significant variation

270
00:24:16,964 --> 00:24:22,064
between these countries in terms of percentage of trips by these

271
00:24:22,064 --> 00:24:27,124
active modes of transportation. if you been to Amsterdam you may have

272
00:24:27,124 --> 00:24:32,364
seen the parking lots for bicycles. it's fascinating. so you take the train

273
00:24:32,364 --> 00:24:37,944
into Amsterdam if you live outside of the city and at the train station. are these

274
00:24:37,944 --> 00:24:43,064
parking lots. you get on your bicycle and you can complete your commune.

275
00:24:43,064 --> 00:24:49,026
so it's sort of testing to see this but

276
00:24:49,026 --> 00:24:54,206
you don't see the same kind of thing. and in this country. so

277
00:24:54,206 --> 00:24:59,326
father hazard Center more conventional that. I know air pollution. you'll

278
00:24:59,326 --> 00:25:04,586
be covering. I think in early April. in door air pollution

279
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:10,406
or indoor here in farmers wells outdoor air pollution. so

280
00:25:10,406 --> 00:25:15,966
but any event air pollution exposure is greater typically in the city

281
00:25:15,966 --> 00:25:21,306
of Motor Vehicle crashes. you can see the statistics

282
00:25:21,306 --> 00:25:26,426
about pedestrian injuries. the talent ease average per

283
00:25:26,426 --> 00:25:31,986
year. quite significant so. so the city

284
00:25:31,986 --> 00:25:37,746
is a dangerous place to live in with respect to walking with respect to biking and in fact

285
00:25:37,746 --> 00:25:42,906
again from the reading chapter in two thousand and one mile walk

286
00:25:42,906 --> 00:25:47,966
in twenty three times more likely to kill a pedestrian that a mile driving

287
00:25:47,966 --> 00:25:52,986
was likely to kill the car occupant. and I look biking was twelve times more likely to kill a

288
00:25:52,986 --> 00:25:58,406
bunch of clothes and I was driving was likely to kill the car occupant.

289
00:25:58,406 --> 00:26:03,786
I was calling of mine. he's at the University of Toronto and he he bikes

290
00:26:03,786 --> 00:26:09,846
about ten miles or so to work everyday and

291
00:26:09,846 --> 00:26:15,546
it's potentially dangerous up. I think to to drive it right if I can.

292
00:26:15,546 --> 00:26:20,826
and if you've done that now. okay so back to the environment and

293
00:26:20,826 --> 00:26:26,286
obesity. this is a literature review from two thousand seven.

294
00:26:26,286 --> 00:26:31,586
review that scrutinize the methodology hi and then cut

295
00:26:31,586 --> 00:26:36,646
the list of articles that met including great year and to just twenty

296
00:26:36,646 --> 00:26:41,666
till twenty articles in here. some draft measures of body wage

297
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:46,686
and to find the built environment. that's a little bit of everything to

298
00:26:46,686 --> 00:26:51,826
do. how do you put metrics. the excess ability

299
00:26:51,826 --> 00:26:57,146
to physical activity or food outlets and the fall in Jackson all these different things which

300
00:26:57,146 --> 00:27:03,286
are being done to try to make sense out_of these kinds of studies.

301
00:27:03,286 --> 00:27:08,466
so just review said that there was an eighty four percent of the studies. this is

302
00:27:08,466 --> 00:27:13,566
to simply significant positive association. what the problem is with even the

303
00:27:13,566 --> 00:27:18,926
design of the studies that we met including criteria. a_lot_of them cross sectional.

304
00:27:18,926 --> 00:27:24,306
you know what that means in terms of their ability to predict calls in the fact.

305
00:27:24,306 --> 00:27:29,646
a_lot_of inconsistent measures. and even considering

306
00:27:29,646 --> 00:27:34,776
rigorous measures of physical activity and live together not just one

307
00:27:34,776 --> 00:27:40,055
or the other. so end up

308
00:27:40,055 --> 00:27:45,475
in the work environment for example. I don't know what they serve here

309
00:27:45,475 --> 00:27:50,495
in the cafeteria you probably have more experience than I do I know from my experience in different

310
00:27:50,495 --> 00:27:55,495
work environments. you should be which his vending machines and was just candy

311
00:27:55,495 --> 00:28:00,575
and chips and and soda pop in and stuff like that. and that

312
00:28:00,575 --> 00:28:06,516
really has changed. I think I mean where I work still bringing Pete sessions.

313
00:28:06,516 --> 00:28:12,075
some fried chicken and all that. but they do have vending machines that have fresh fruit

314
00:28:12,075 --> 00:28:18,396
and other healthier food so that's happening more than it ever did in the past.

315
00:28:18,396 --> 00:28:23,435
also a place to exercise. mean you got here. see seriously

316
00:28:23,435 --> 00:28:30,115
example. but you know a_lot_of especially larger work areas. work environments

317
00:28:30,115 --> 00:28:36,277
walking your areas. work out facilities and

318
00:28:36,277 --> 00:28:42,318
and just more of an emphasis on healthy eating. I know my wife works over at

319
00:28:42,318 --> 00:28:47,677
the hospital here and I think she was saying that the

320
00:28:47,677 --> 00:28:52,897
two near the elevators and the stairways. there are little signs that say walk

321
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:58,797
up one and down to. so we encourage you. encouraging you to use the stairs

322
00:28:58,797 --> 00:29:03,917
and here. if you just going up one flight or down to and if you are more interested

323
00:29:03,917 --> 00:29:08,917
you can go up ten if you want you know it's a good. again a good opportunity. take a few

324
00:29:08,917 --> 00:29:14,017
more minutes and get some exercise in. when you're not setting aside a half an hour

325
00:29:14,017 --> 00:29:19,097
an hour to actually work out.

326
00:29:19,097 --> 00:29:24,097
so the concept of the built environment and mental health. there's a

327
00:29:24,097 --> 00:29:29,797
research that suggest that for a high rise housing. if there's

328
00:29:29,797 --> 00:29:35,497
more psychological distress. that seems to be consistent in repeated

329
00:29:35,497 --> 00:29:41,807
research less consistent in from cross sectional date.

330
00:29:41,807 --> 00:29:47,147
depending on the floor. see if the high rise facility that there maybe

331
00:29:47,147 --> 00:30:03,987
an impact for those living in the upper floors having more psychological distress.

332
00:30:03,987 --> 00:30:08,987
right it's good question earlier. explanations are really serious as to

333
00:30:08,987 --> 00:30:13,987
why these affects. I think so. but again this is I'm reaching

334
00:30:13,987 --> 00:30:19,007
the depth of my knowledge about this topic and like some of the other topics so.

335
00:30:19,007 --> 00:30:24,927
I couldn't tell you but I'm sure that that's been speculating upon

336
00:30:24,927 --> 00:30:30,207
why that might be the case because you're talking about. possibility right with or if

337
00:30:30,207 --> 00:30:37,611
you believe in the biological possibility for that association

338
00:30:37,611 --> 00:30:43,111
so more about the built environment and mid mental health. so

339
00:30:43,111 --> 00:30:48,411
there are techniques to try to determine our

340
00:30:48,411 --> 00:30:53,731
client metric on neighborhood quality and that there's greater psychological

341
00:30:53,731 --> 00:30:58,851
stress and for cognitive development in children.

342
00:30:58,851 --> 00:31:03,991
but again mostly cross sectional and allergies. even

343
00:31:03,991 --> 00:31:09,551
in this case that second bullet is the study and psychiatric patients. we're furniture

344
00:31:09,551 --> 00:31:14,731
placement. which will determine whether your sitting close or further

345
00:31:14,731 --> 00:31:20,091
away from other people. so it's awful distance thing. the architecture single rooms

346
00:31:20,091 --> 00:31:25,911
versus shared rooms as an example. can be determined into to

347
00:31:25,911 --> 00:31:31,811
degree of social interaction including isolation

348
00:31:31,811 --> 00:31:36,899
and some consistent research showing that that better function in psychiatric

349
00:31:36,899 --> 00:31:42,159
patients when you attend to the cell again.

350
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:48,380
designing facilities for mental health patients that can improve

351
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:53,459
their psychological state. some

352
00:31:53,459 --> 00:31:58,959
mixed data with respect to distress and children and exposure to aircraft noise.

353
00:31:58,959 --> 00:32:04,159
you know we drive by the airport and you see the rows of housing. right under

354
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:09,179
the flight pass and then some some consistent information with

355
00:32:09,179 --> 00:32:14,279
respect to pollutants and into work here. especially indoor

356
00:32:14,279 --> 00:32:21,259
air that you can smell something wrong with link to negative affect.

357
00:32:21,259 --> 00:32:26,599
and then this is interesting. so like it's between how much you drive

358
00:32:26,599 --> 00:32:32,019
through commuting to work and your psychological state and

359
00:32:32,019 --> 00:32:37,557
anybody was driven on the road. that's everybody I have seen

360
00:32:37,557 --> 00:32:43,237
that behavior on the road and enough to make you HS. if not angry

361
00:32:43,237 --> 00:32:49,617
and so there are some there were some research in this case.

362
00:32:49,617 --> 00:32:54,718
association between blood pressure and self-reports self-reports

363
00:32:54,718 --> 00:32:59,737
but attention there was feelings determined by how long it takes

364
00:32:59,737 --> 00:33:05,393
you to get to work. and in this particular report in the long term follow up

365
00:33:05,393 --> 00:33:10,773
people who had more freeway changes and road changes

366
00:33:10,773 --> 00:33:15,974
number free was route changes. actually had more frequent calls. influenza in

367
00:33:15,974 --> 00:33:21,133
sixties off work. so interesting weather. long

368
00:33:21,133 --> 00:33:26,493
can you interacting with you consider

369
00:33:26,493 --> 00:33:32,214
a driver shall we say. leading to more stress and maybe more volatility

370
00:33:32,214 --> 00:33:37,253
or separately to the common cold. is

371
00:33:37,253 --> 00:33:42,693
anybody ever while driving and they get cut off sworn out loud

372
00:33:42,693 --> 00:33:48,013
or given somebody the finger. yell at somebody else or Paul because

373
00:33:48,013 --> 00:33:53,133
you've been offended. even if it wasn't safe unsafe somebody cut you off to get

374
00:33:53,133 --> 00:33:58,573
angry hot. so more. so and they're actually is for the purposes of research the definition

375
00:33:58,573 --> 00:34:03,933
of road rage and angry or inpatient driver. tries to kill or injured

376
00:34:03,933 --> 00:34:09,549
another driver. after a traffic dispute so I'm sure this is resident for

377
00:34:09,549 --> 00:34:15,869
everybody. there's a Disney cartoon. I think it's Pluto.

378
00:34:15,869 --> 00:34:21,189
but it's really worth it to pro rate curtain. it's from three zero four

379
00:34:21,189 --> 00:34:26,649
East and he's. it's funny. but also Ian is completely

380
00:34:26,649 --> 00:34:32,309
relevant today. getting angry and steamed up to go from calm and collected

381
00:34:32,309 --> 00:34:37,309
to and angry in range. person who

382
00:34:37,309 --> 00:34:42,869
can do terrible thanks. and just as an example this is the of news

383
00:34:42,869 --> 00:34:48,189
from about two and half years ago. Reading or follow us to stop the road

384
00:34:48,189 --> 00:34:53,349
West on ninety six. this for funeral guy's wife are driving to pick up their

385
00:34:53,349 --> 00:34:58,509
kids from school. first day of school and some kind of pick up. he's tailgating

386
00:34:58,509 --> 00:35:03,869
and you can't even see the lights head lights of the guys pick up because he's tailgating

387
00:35:03,869 --> 00:35:09,771
and then the guy comes around cuts in front of the car

388
00:35:09,771 --> 00:35:14,990
in slammed on breaks he does had a couple of times so. this is a little bit here

389
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:20,110
but it's not I'm not at plenty of time. people from slam on

390
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:25,571
brakes and did a couple times. the guy got his car husband father.

391
00:35:25,571 --> 00:35:30,930
the kids were gonna pick up and do something I would never do that engage

392
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:36,250
somebody from the general public especially who showing crazy behavior.

393
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:41,351
he walked behind his heart to talk to the guy. what are you doing. and he can

394
00:35:41,351 --> 00:35:46,351
shop for you. just like the guy in the pick up truck shot and killed

395
00:35:46,351 --> 00:35:52,430
him and so judge send them into trial and feel little break shooting.

396
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:57,430
not not terribly unusual that you can direct from Rotary. so this

397
00:35:57,430 --> 00:36:02,591
is AAA Foundation for traffic safety. looking between the years

398
00:36:02,591 --> 00:36:08,031
of nineteen ninety nineteen ninety six. first of all a fifty one percent increase in reported

399
00:36:08,031 --> 00:36:13,138
road rage rich reporting or an actual increase. I'm

400
00:36:13,138 --> 00:36:18,219
not sure if that was investigated. that included ten thousand documents

401
00:36:18,219 --> 00:36:23,618
reports with over twelve thousand injuries in two hundred and eighteen tax. so

402
00:36:23,618 --> 00:36:30,058
it's not trivial. this idea of road region what happens out there on the roads.

403
00:36:30,058 --> 00:36:35,538
okay. so the concept of different exposures. which was sort of what

404
00:36:35,538 --> 00:36:40,719
initially the the environmental Justice movement and that

405
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:45,918
there are certain domains within the building environment that

406
00:36:45,918 --> 00:36:50,918
we are desperate exposure tends to occur curve both specially and also in terms of

407
00:36:50,918 --> 00:36:55,998
certain populations. so wanna be housing that there

408
00:36:55,998 --> 00:37:01,078
some senior housing in most especially most big cities that for

409
00:37:01,078 --> 00:37:06,158
many reasons can be better helpful for exposures like flag and

410
00:37:06,158 --> 00:37:11,244
so forth. it's been often said in fact at the school here at the

411
00:37:11,244 --> 00:37:16,324
the previous teens. lots of research into asthma. in the

412
00:37:16,324 --> 00:37:21,984
university. there's also always other kinds of

413
00:37:21,984 --> 00:37:27,125
exposures. two situations that can create disease. but also just

414
00:37:27,125 --> 00:37:32,664
infrastructure buildings with holes in the wall on the floors and lack of

415
00:37:32,664 --> 00:37:37,865
utilities. as an example. and then again the flip side to contrast

416
00:37:37,865 --> 00:37:43,504
that good housing can promote health and not just prevent

417
00:37:43,504 --> 00:37:48,844
your health but actually have a plus from from the

418
00:37:48,844 --> 00:37:54,484
from the neutral level. also transportation.

419
00:37:54,484 --> 00:37:59,724
of course transportation. bus cross train routes and so forth are important and

420
00:37:59,724 --> 00:38:04,784
they connect the built environment. and so of course it's it's

421
00:38:04,784 --> 00:38:09,804
a structure but also process it's very important for the functioning

422
00:38:09,804 --> 00:38:14,969
of the build environment but also the infrastructure can often

423
00:38:14,969 --> 00:38:20,589
be desirable and a_lot_of times it's near highway

424
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:25,789
near a bus depot. where some. sometimes you find

425
00:38:25,789 --> 00:38:31,129
this advantage groups living and so therefore exposure to noise air pollution maybe

426
00:38:31,129 --> 00:38:36,148
to increased risk of injury and just exposure to work. it's been

427
00:38:36,148 --> 00:38:41,448
called smaller and actually measured is smaller and so

428
00:38:41,448 --> 00:38:46,969
and it's ironic. and again part of this concept of social justice.

429
00:38:46,969 --> 00:38:52,668
often times it's the people who don't ever can't benefit from this transportation Systems.

430
00:38:52,668 --> 00:38:58,029
who may actually be the recipients of the disparity

431
00:38:58,029 --> 00:39:03,049
some terms so. it's a living next to the trash port to the bus station

432
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:08,388
and being exposed. not sure he will heard of food service.

433
00:39:08,388 --> 00:39:13,397
this also gets incorporated into the concept I know last year. last time

434
00:39:13,397 --> 00:39:18,657
was wrong of course out there was a number of people who are familiar with. I think is

435
00:39:18,657 --> 00:39:23,977
relatively new whole foods in the city of Detroit. there's some. yeah. so some

436
00:39:23,977 --> 00:39:29,157
of you I think at least some awareness about that. so you are familiar with

437
00:39:29,157 --> 00:39:34,777
who does or just where where instead of going to the farmers market in Ann_Arbor

438
00:39:34,777 --> 00:39:39,857
or to one of the local grocery stores. you go to the corner store it's a convenient

439
00:39:39,857 --> 00:39:45,413
store that sells is much shorter path as you can imagine. would beer or cigarettes

440
00:39:45,413 --> 00:39:50,433
or chips. but not very much in terms of fresh fruits and smokes

441
00:39:50,433 --> 00:39:55,633
and so forth and so there is this potential link between food

442
00:39:55,633 --> 00:40:00,713
gestures or rolling to scarcity and healthy food in certain environments for people

443
00:40:00,713 --> 00:40:07,193
living there for they don't have access and prop perhaps they have increased

444
00:40:07,193 --> 00:40:12,353
phone ability vendors to set the ability to these conditions obesity diabetes and heart

445
00:40:12,353 --> 00:40:17,453
disease and so forth. so similarly to be just very reasonable environment with

446
00:40:17,453 --> 00:40:22,633
respect to access to nature and in the in the form of City parks

447
00:40:22,633 --> 00:40:27,833
and green spaces. and two for a talk about that there is

448
00:40:27,833 --> 00:40:32,833
value to experiencing. I need your major your vote. in terms of cognitive

449
00:40:32,833 --> 00:40:37,873
service psychological help. but also for physical activity so physical health

450
00:40:37,873 --> 00:40:43,213
and social interaction. alright. you want to talk to somebody else extra conversation

451
00:40:43,213 --> 00:40:48,555
and now it's a little bit more richer experience and there maybe disadvantaged

452
00:40:48,555 --> 00:40:54,975
cruise with respect to access to this kind of component of the bill to convert.

453
00:40:54,975 --> 00:41:00,495
so make scholar and sort of involved. this idea

454
00:41:00,495 --> 00:41:05,695
of the broken window series which was published about thirty five years

455
00:41:05,695 --> 00:41:10,815
ago in the early eighties and the concept is fairly straight forward. if

456
00:41:10,815 --> 00:41:16,075
you are in an environment in the city and there's a building. so it's not

457
00:41:16,075 --> 00:41:21,575
happening in the windows is broken. if that's left on repaired pretty soon.

458
00:41:21,575 --> 00:41:26,735
all the windows in the building or in the area will be broken because it looks like nobody

459
00:41:26,735 --> 00:41:31,896
cares about it. nobody's gonna repair it. then it's sort of a free for all and

460
00:41:31,896 --> 00:41:37,656
so. so that idea that the message

461
00:41:37,656 --> 00:41:43,115
that school our clinics is broken windows graffiti and so forth.

462
00:41:43,115 --> 00:41:48,366
can be permitted to exist and not be attended to. the concept

463
00:41:48,366 --> 00:41:53,726
is that you become self reinforcing. they have a smaller index that looks

464
00:41:53,726 --> 00:41:58,826
at these things including what I said in in in leader and so forth. and this one.

465
00:41:58,826 --> 00:42:03,886
research high compared high school and got ready and found that they were

466
00:42:03,886 --> 00:42:08,886
fire. got rear rates in these areas. so call us at

467
00:42:08,886 --> 00:42:14,346
two or just come together. the idea is. however that

468
00:42:14,346 --> 00:42:19,366
residence or the neighborhood where you live. can be a protector both of more minutes even and

469
00:42:19,366 --> 00:42:25,266
also actually more town. so population is at risk.

470
00:42:25,266 --> 00:42:30,306
this is Heidi here is out for the soccer moms will attend to

471
00:42:30,306 --> 00:42:35,626
be that women. just proportionately lower at home. driving

472
00:42:35,626 --> 00:42:40,906
their kids to and from places school sports doctor and on and on and on

473
00:42:40,906 --> 00:42:46,446
and that there's a_lot_of time I'm in average mothers morning father's.

474
00:42:46,446 --> 00:42:51,738
spend doing this kind of activity more there in our driving twenty nine miles

475
00:42:51,738 --> 00:42:58,878
or more more than five trips. so I need typical day. and here's a grass from

476
00:42:58,878 --> 00:43:04,058
the surface transportation policy partnership. we are on the Y axis

477
00:43:04,058 --> 00:43:09,298
the vertical axis. it's the number. average daily trip. so how many trips

478
00:43:09,298 --> 00:43:14,778
by car per day. and on the X axis is a time line just comparing

479
00:43:14,778 --> 00:43:19,798
from nineteen eighty three to nineteen ninety five and you can see that the

480
00:43:19,798 --> 00:43:25,018
national average is the lower line and mud versus the upper line. that the number of

481
00:43:25,018 --> 00:43:30,038
trips per day has grown tremendously from eighty three ninety

482
00:43:30,038 --> 00:43:37,518
five. with mother is leading the national average. over the entire times.

483
00:43:37,518 --> 00:43:42,618
so our children. we talked a little bit about children that you have learned a little bit

484
00:43:42,618 --> 00:43:47,798
about children in terms of the risk for not occupational obviously but

485
00:43:47,798 --> 00:43:53,354
for of our mental illness kids have more exposure

486
00:43:53,354 --> 00:43:58,454
to air pollution as an example. they're not just small adults. they

487
00:43:58,454 --> 00:44:03,494
have proportionately higher degree exposure.

488
00:44:03,494 --> 00:44:08,594
given their their mass then Dallas too. they tend to have more

489
00:44:08,594 --> 00:44:13,594
exposure. due to more time outdoors and

490
00:44:13,594 --> 00:44:18,934
as you probably learn. not only are the referee system still developing after birth but also

491
00:44:18,934 --> 00:44:24,494
in your logical system the central nervous system continues to develop after

492
00:44:24,494 --> 00:44:30,234
and so you can should be a higher problems of asthma.

493
00:44:30,234 --> 00:44:35,274
in there and partly because there are more vulnerable to

494
00:44:35,274 --> 00:44:41,074
pollutants. here's a kind of an extreme example this is Stephanie. this is

495
00:44:41,074 --> 00:44:46,114
after the earthquake in twenty ten. risk a quick in Haiti. so many people

496
00:44:46,114 --> 00:44:51,514
we're displaced today at about a thousand people we're living in the median of the busiest

497
00:44:51,514 --> 00:44:56,738
route in the country so you can imagine these thousand people.

498
00:44:56,738 --> 00:45:01,938
families in the kind of exposures. not just two

499
00:45:01,938 --> 00:45:07,057
automobile exhaust noise. but to

500
00:45:07,057 --> 00:45:12,198
for danger injury and so forth. I'm not sure how long

501
00:45:12,198 --> 00:45:19,057
that situation lasted but it was not just a matter of days.

502
00:45:19,057 --> 00:45:25,377
so children are more on a role to these kinds of injuries and accidents

503
00:45:25,377 --> 00:45:30,557
and and also they some

504
00:45:30,557 --> 00:45:35,877
populations will be more inclined to use

505
00:45:35,877 --> 00:45:41,238
the passive molds of transportation to school

506
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:46,698
and so forth and so there's increased risk. therefore in terms of

507
00:45:46,698 --> 00:45:51,718
diabetes and obesity service this. this position.

508
00:45:51,718 --> 00:45:57,855
pediatrician in Washington DC got a_lot_of press. he had a patient

509
00:45:57,855 --> 00:46:02,855
hi Tina looks like we need to get more exercise shoes or fees. and he actually

510
00:46:02,855 --> 00:46:08,855
wrote a prescription that says get off the bus. four blocks before your regular stop

511
00:46:08,855 --> 00:46:13,875
and walk that last part every day and

512
00:46:13,875 --> 00:46:19,015
she lost considerable amount of weight. just from that prescription for

513
00:46:19,015 --> 00:46:24,398
physical activity. to take a percentage of the passive transport

514
00:46:24,398 --> 00:46:29,958
to and from school and turned in to active transport.

515
00:46:29,958 --> 00:46:35,598
so the elderly are also at risk. typically only helps

516
00:46:35,598 --> 00:46:40,978
increase degrees. physical and parents limited ability to pop

517
00:46:40,978 --> 00:46:46,098
in seeing arthritis in the knees and so forth and so

518
00:46:46,098 --> 00:46:51,338
and if they're also unable to drive. then they are just advantage

519
00:46:51,338 --> 00:46:57,278
to specially in environments that are built on

520
00:46:57,278 --> 00:47:02,278
pass of transportation for sample. if you don't drive and you have a

521
00:47:02,278 --> 00:47:08,958
difficult time walking and you live in LA. that's a bad combination.

522
00:47:08,958 --> 00:47:14,578
and so these kinds of scenarios can lead to the elderly being

523
00:47:14,578 --> 00:47:19,638
isolated in looking for people and people

524
00:47:19,638 --> 00:47:24,658
of color disadvantage drug groups that can be discriminated

525
00:47:24,658 --> 00:47:29,665
again based on the location where

526
00:47:29,665 --> 00:47:35,445
they reside in the Dupree

527
00:47:35,445 --> 00:47:41,105
house crawl in these in this context

528
00:47:41,105 --> 00:47:46,125
can create a greater degree of separation. so if you have separation

529
00:47:46,125 --> 00:47:51,505
separation of classes income classes so if you can on the status is

530
00:47:51,505 --> 00:47:56,845
and so forth. with the same just for the facts and people with disabilities

531
00:47:56,845 --> 00:48:02,765
or physical impairment similar to the elderly. I

532
00:48:02,765 --> 00:48:08,465
have the same kind of potential for being isolated transportation systems that may not

533
00:48:08,465 --> 00:48:16,065
be amenable to someone with a physical impairment.

534
00:48:16,065 --> 00:48:21,165
and you know in the past at work the curb cuts to get around in a wheelchair

535
00:48:21,165 --> 00:48:26,171
for example. more more that's the case so

536
00:48:26,171 --> 00:48:31,171
in terms of building environment. again I think it's a fascinating topic.

537
00:48:31,171 --> 00:48:36,511
every time I go through this material I think about it. just when I'm driving

538
00:48:36,511 --> 00:48:41,511
or walking or bicycling. I can think about this in terms of use

539
00:48:41,511 --> 00:48:47,111
to determine what to do and how you do it. in the scale

540
00:48:47,111 --> 00:48:52,391
which this can affect population. and it's

541
00:48:52,391 --> 00:48:57,911
again the concept is limited to negative the toxic environment

542
00:48:57,911 --> 00:49:03,071
but also send you wait the positive improving environment or developing

543
00:49:03,071 --> 00:49:08,191
environments that can actually improve health as opposed to just preventing. I

544
00:49:08,191 --> 00:49:13,951
do look your recent clocks that taking effect mental health psychological well-being.

545
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:19,131
if there's a broad range of the spirit of using social justice issues again. I captured

546
00:49:19,131 --> 00:49:24,635
quite nicely in this in this perspective article and that

547
00:49:24,635 --> 00:49:29,735
the environment can really have a strong impact. what we do how we get to

548
00:49:29,735 --> 00:49:34,835
from one place to another. that there's a possible relationship to obesity.

549
00:49:34,835 --> 00:49:40,095
hope we see that still being investigated and that people who live in suburbs

550
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:45,135
and places that are far out in our bedroom communities are just gonna be driving in

551
00:49:45,135 --> 00:49:50,215
consuming gasoline. morning people who live in cities and

552
00:49:50,215 --> 00:49:55,735
are able to access their destinations more readily

553
00:49:55,735 --> 00:50:01,535
that a highly walkable neighborhood. tends to have high density mixed use.

554
00:50:01,535 --> 00:50:06,935
connectivity transportation and so forth. that there are

555
00:50:06,935 --> 00:50:12,315
three Line Street and second side walk up much more pleasing as statically

556
00:50:12,315 --> 00:50:18,215
safer and so forth. and again that the science is. he's quite young.

557
00:50:18,215 --> 00:50:23,337
there's need just like there is for. as I mentioned for shift work

558
00:50:23,337 --> 00:50:29,017
more Rivers everything the LG two to kinda solidify these concepts.

559
00:50:29,017 --> 00:50:34,497
but really the whole idea of the building is really taking off in waste

560
00:50:34,497 --> 00:50:39,517
that. like I say ten twenty three years ago really it wasn't

561
00:50:39,517 --> 00:50:45,477
the level of consciousness research or certainly and

562
00:50:45,477 --> 00:50:58,217
an hour or so. so that's it for the built environment in the

563
00:50:58,217 --> 00:51:06,097
right

564
00:51:06,097 --> 00:51:11,197
part of it at some point in terms of. yeah I assume. so said he have done zoning for

565
00:51:11,197 --> 00:51:17,597
years and whether they've incorporated the concept of the built environment with respect to hell.

566
00:51:17,597 --> 00:51:22,805
I suspect you know in the field of architecture and urban planning landscape architecture

567
00:51:22,805 --> 00:51:27,825
all these areas. I think you're right. are coming out this concept and maybe

568
00:51:27,825 --> 00:51:33,205
they use a different term I don't know if that term built environment is in common usage for

569
00:51:33,205 --> 00:51:38,705
urban planners. this is an example. but my guess is that they would have a consciousness

570
00:51:38,705 --> 00:51:43,825
of these issues more so than maybe in the past.

571
00:51:43,825 --> 00:51:50,905
it's a good point. anything else.

572
00:51:50,905 --> 00:51:56,025
okay. so talking about shifting gears from

573
00:51:56,025 --> 00:52:01,125
the macro scale to the DVD scale. so

574
00:52:01,125 --> 00:52:07,945
this is just kind of a short presentation about mental technology.

575
00:52:07,945 --> 00:52:13,005
I guess same question. ten years ago. I didn't hear much

576
00:52:13,005 --> 00:52:18,125
at all. she didn't have all of you had at least some experience in course

577
00:52:18,125 --> 00:52:23,223
work and so forth. I'm in the chair of the department Andrew Maynard

578
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:31,523
the article that's reading. probably spread the word and

579
00:52:31,523 --> 00:52:36,603
the curvy and in fact it's a_lot_of work with new technology. so.

580
00:52:36,603 --> 00:52:43,223
so this will be entirely new to. most of you. but we'll go ahead and sort of do an overview.

581
00:52:43,223 --> 00:52:48,343
first of all just understanding our terms and in what we're speaking up

582
00:52:48,343 --> 00:52:53,923
to one nanometers. it is ten to minus nine meters over billions of the meter.

583
00:52:53,923 --> 00:52:59,123
you can compare it to a few in here you can compare it to our red blood cell. it's very

584
00:52:59,123 --> 00:53:04,271
small it's really on the size of a Malik user or viruses and we're

585
00:53:04,271 --> 00:53:09,311
talked we talked previously about microns and science and so forth. there's

586
00:53:09,311 --> 00:53:15,311
a thousand nanometers and one microns. so get we're talking about orders of magnitude

587
00:53:15,311 --> 00:53:20,551
smaller than what we typically talk about

588
00:53:20,551 --> 00:53:26,091
and it already mentioned about air pollution there will be some analogy to air pollution because air pollution

589
00:53:26,091 --> 00:53:31,331
does involve a particular matter. p.m. that's

590
00:53:31,331 --> 00:53:36,911
a very very small size including the sides that includes

591
00:53:36,911 --> 00:53:44,191
and materials. so there's some relevance there. although we're not talking about that here.

592
00:53:44,191 --> 00:53:49,271
so in terms of mental materials for our purposes were talking about

593
00:53:49,271 --> 00:53:54,491
between one and a hundred nanoliters. and so we're just talking about something

594
00:53:54,491 --> 00:53:59,944
of a certain size if you talked about. everything gets between one and two feet long

595
00:53:59,944 --> 00:54:05,504
give me a call me about anything and so if you keep that in mind we're just talking about very very small

596
00:54:05,504 --> 00:54:10,604
stuff and that stuff could be made out_of any. so we really are

597
00:54:10,604 --> 00:54:15,644
talking about. she should do first least Lexington water pollution.

598
00:54:15,644 --> 00:54:20,764
what's in the water mother's living stuff there's dead stuff in it again next out there for

599
00:54:20,764 --> 00:54:26,584
cancer. there's cup chemicals are so much there. so we're really talking about.

600
00:54:26,584 --> 00:54:32,784
just got huge range of types of materials.

601
00:54:32,784 --> 00:54:37,784
with respect to the materials and you know I don't

602
00:54:37,784 --> 00:54:42,984
know if Doctor Robin's talked about when the discussion about

603
00:54:42,984 --> 00:54:48,604
organic solvent and so forth that with your Cosco EPA is responsible

604
00:54:48,604 --> 00:54:54,244
for regulating chemicals in production. there's like over eighty thousand of them.

605
00:54:54,244 --> 00:54:59,324
so given enough time we're gonna be talking about probably greater

606
00:54:59,324 --> 00:55:05,330
diversity with respect to really small things that we call in the materials.

607
00:55:05,330 --> 00:55:10,330
so I'll let you. for over is expanding in

608
00:55:10,330 --> 00:55:16,190
scream at another time but just so you can see that on the left side on your left.

609
00:55:16,190 --> 00:55:21,290
our natural objects ranging from somewhat small like

610
00:55:21,290 --> 00:55:26,950
a centimeter down to nano scale and smaller and on the right side.

611
00:55:26,950 --> 00:55:32,350
and inmate materials. and it's four inches gazing at that a little bit and kind of observing

612
00:55:32,350 --> 00:55:37,970
it again because we're talking about such a huge range size.

613
00:55:37,970 --> 00:55:43,510
very ability that just to get a sense for

614
00:55:43,510 --> 00:55:48,650
really two sides of these and the materials and this is also

615
00:55:48,650 --> 00:55:54,450
this actually slides from the presentation about air pollution. so I mentioned that

616
00:55:54,450 --> 00:55:59,990
your pollution is described with respect to particular matter side

617
00:55:59,990 --> 00:56:05,122
so that should be needed. p.m. and so the course fraction

618
00:56:05,122 --> 00:56:10,222
here p.m. between groups between ten and

619
00:56:10,222 --> 00:56:15,222
two. five microns. you can see seven of them sitting on the

620
00:56:15,222 --> 00:56:20,362
just cut and you a human here and then find a particular matter. that is

621
00:56:20,362 --> 00:56:25,982
particular matter that it's two. five microns in last in size.

622
00:56:25,982 --> 00:56:31,102
you can see the relative size compare to this particular matter and then

623
00:56:31,102 --> 00:56:36,182
alter fine particles. otherwise notice PM zero point one two zero point

624
00:56:36,182 --> 00:56:41,322
one microns and now we're getting down to zero. one microns

625
00:56:41,322 --> 00:56:46,502
particular matter is between ten and a hundred nanometers were talking about

626
00:56:46,502 --> 00:56:54,062
that size and even smaller. in terms of panel materials.

627
00:56:54,062 --> 00:57:00,022
so the thing is that size the physical

628
00:57:00,022 --> 00:57:06,166
characteristics of stuff this small can first up on these materials.

629
00:57:06,166 --> 00:57:11,426
unique properties. it's the physical chemical logical behavior. better that's

630
00:57:11,426 --> 00:57:17,766
on Lexie's. take the same mass of

631
00:57:17,766 --> 00:57:24,006
carbon as an example. one is macro size particles one is micro

632
00:57:24,006 --> 00:57:29,246
size particles of carbon and he behave totally different. and typically the

633
00:57:29,246 --> 00:57:34,846
nano size materials are much more active via logically.

634
00:57:34,846 --> 00:57:40,146
in terms of zero five. so that's what that second bullet is trying to say that

635
00:57:40,146 --> 00:57:45,146
they say size matters and the small size has

636
00:57:45,146 --> 00:57:50,566
a significant impact on how these particles contract

637
00:57:50,566 --> 00:57:57,926
with people and animals and so forth. so

638
00:57:57,926 --> 00:58:03,442
we're talking about. for our purposes engineered manner materials. not

639
00:58:03,442 --> 00:58:08,762
intentionally produce materials like you can seen diesel exhaust or other

640
00:58:08,762 --> 00:58:13,942
particular it's in the air so the alter fine particular the PM zero point one.

641
00:58:13,942 --> 00:58:19,082
there is an allergy. in terms of Halifax the fax but we're not talking about that we're talking about

642
00:58:19,082 --> 00:58:24,642
stuff that people make the engineer. so

643
00:58:24,642 --> 00:58:29,942
you probably are we are that the reason why we have the concern about materials

644
00:58:29,942 --> 00:58:34,942
is that nano technology is growing by leads and balance because there were a_lot_of

645
00:58:34,942 --> 00:58:40,462
positive aspects of these kinds of materials being developed

646
00:58:40,462 --> 00:58:45,782
and so there's no warmest variety

647
00:58:45,782 --> 00:58:50,982
and range of applications that can help us in many ways

648
00:58:50,982 --> 00:58:56,002
to prevent pollution to remove pollutants using it to

649
00:58:56,002 --> 00:59:02,386
design cleaner and just your processes. and and so forth. so

650
00:59:02,386 --> 00:59:08,126
so huge benefits potentially. there's a_lot_of thought into this article

651
00:59:08,126 --> 00:59:13,426
which is our ten years old. hundreds of consumer products. more

652
00:59:13,426 --> 00:59:19,646
rotten materials that are intermediary is in as components.

653
00:59:19,646 --> 00:59:24,726
just like feed stock chemicals to produce others. other materials that are

654
00:59:24,726 --> 00:59:30,606
you will be used either in commercial products consumer products or even industrial applications.

655
00:59:30,606 --> 00:59:35,806
and here's just a list of things that can can and some of which

656
00:59:35,806 --> 00:59:40,946
contain micro or materials. refrigerators that

657
00:59:40,946 --> 00:59:46,282
have holdings that are anti- macro. so they're not chemicals.

658
00:59:46,282 --> 00:59:51,582
the are the physical structure. these particles that are on the surface coding

659
00:59:51,582 --> 00:59:57,542
the refrigerator that kills bacteria. as an example.

660
00:59:57,542 --> 01:00:03,762
okay. so there are types. all engineered

661
01:00:03,762 --> 01:00:09,262
materials and so I've just listed in there this is for my book report

662
01:00:09,262 --> 01:00:14,402
card base metal based on drummers composites. I don't know much about this job but

663
01:00:14,402 --> 01:00:19,542
it's just FYI that there were different categories. these

664
01:00:19,542 --> 01:00:25,002
human designer engineer and the materials and make pretty pictures. which is why I

665
01:00:25,002 --> 01:00:30,002
put that picture there. so the question is what about the health

666
01:00:30,002 --> 01:00:35,502
of Texas exposure. specially for those who are involved in the manufacturing

667
01:00:35,502 --> 01:00:42,367
process applications in the industry. so

668
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:47,487
the problem is that we have an opportunity now to be. we've meeting people who

669
01:00:47,487 --> 01:00:52,767
work with us stuff to be exposed to just one more message range. these

670
01:00:52,767 --> 01:00:58,047
engineered materials that have new shapes sizes and physical and chemical

671
01:00:58,047 --> 01:01:03,487
properties. much of which we have very little knowledge.

672
01:01:03,487 --> 01:01:08,527
so that's another take a message we're really at the front in the very beginning. the

673
01:01:08,527 --> 01:01:14,187
front tier and trying to catch up with the development

674
01:01:14,187 --> 01:01:19,667
of these materials. we tried to catch up meeting trying to define what

675
01:01:19,667 --> 01:01:25,567
potential hazards are to exposure. even how to exposure is Kurt.

676
01:01:25,567 --> 01:01:31,887
so much of this stuff is clearly unclear.

677
01:01:31,887 --> 01:01:36,947
certainly at the very beginning of our ability to

678
01:01:36,947 --> 01:01:42,143
to actually understand and can't predict what might happen

679
01:01:42,143 --> 01:01:47,303
so even in terms of knowing for sure what the damage exposure

680
01:01:47,303 --> 01:01:53,183
roads are and what levels are safe and

681
01:01:53,183 --> 01:01:58,503
what the taxes. these are these materials. so rather than

682
01:01:58,503 --> 01:02:04,063
having a discussion of the exposures that we have definitive

683
01:02:04,063 --> 01:02:10,383
causal relationship established here it's all the stuff really that we don't know.

684
01:02:10,383 --> 01:02:15,583
so lot of stuff not well defined and but I did

685
01:02:15,583 --> 01:02:21,143
I've already alluded to. I'll to find air pollution. PM zero point one micron

686
01:02:21,143 --> 01:02:26,583
stuff. that have an allergy so we talked about

687
01:02:26,583 --> 01:02:31,623
possible injury for a conference. you learned that in some cases you

688
01:02:31,623 --> 01:02:37,503
can find an allergy saver. this particular chemical.

689
01:02:37,503 --> 01:02:42,609
is the truth fact this chemical has similar properties

690
01:02:42,609 --> 01:02:47,809
and so maybe we can draw some conclusions there. so there is some

691
01:02:47,809 --> 01:02:52,809
potential to do that and in some cases. researches has

692
01:02:52,809 --> 01:02:58,109
borrowed on that and I do have an allergy. so for example

693
01:02:58,109 --> 01:03:03,309
if your pollution. give an example.

694
01:03:03,309 --> 01:03:08,329
so most of the research has look on insulation. look at in relation

695
01:03:08,329 --> 01:03:13,789
as a primary route of exposure. but they're gonna be other potentially

696
01:03:13,789 --> 01:03:19,349
significant ropes. we would look at the lunch because stuff is floating in here.

697
01:03:19,349 --> 01:03:24,609
the likelihood is that largest fraction of the largest actual

698
01:03:24,609 --> 01:03:29,709
exposure opportunity to get in your body is gonna be in

699
01:03:29,709 --> 01:03:34,949
handling loan in handling here in your lungs I think you remember me and Hill about fifteen

700
01:03:34,949 --> 01:03:40,589
kilograms of your day. lot of here that moves in and out and if you have an exposure

701
01:03:40,589 --> 01:03:46,009
then you're probably gonna get the maximum exposure by installation. but

702
01:03:46,009 --> 01:03:51,069
stuff that's this is small. might be important in terms of durable

703
01:03:51,069 --> 01:03:56,569
exposure. so I talked about somebody's blog who's HIV positive

704
01:03:56,569 --> 01:04:01,689
get splash on your skin. it's basically a non- issue. if your skin

705
01:04:01,689 --> 01:04:06,749
isn't have these in with you real some of them are so small as

706
01:04:06,749 --> 01:04:12,389
possible. again they were all talking about. we're talking theoretically but it's possible

707
01:04:12,389 --> 01:04:17,489
that some of the stuff can for me to skin. you coastal Services were there.

708
01:04:17,489 --> 01:04:22,609
it's the high lining of the mouth. inside of your nose. where exposure

709
01:04:22,609 --> 01:04:29,189
can occur and even oral exposure.

710
01:04:29,189 --> 01:04:34,409
and then sort of like there's always ways to explain how it gets even more

711
01:04:34,409 --> 01:04:39,425
complicated than that. so you have individual national materials

712
01:04:39,425 --> 01:04:44,725
Andy because of their structure. they can essentially

713
01:04:44,725 --> 01:04:50,985
form thinking form of a blonde rich which are essentially close. and these are not held together

714
01:04:50,985 --> 01:04:56,085
by chemical bonds they're held together by weeks physical forces. based

715
01:04:56,085 --> 01:05:01,905
on their structure. but when they online rate together and form these clowns.

716
01:05:01,905 --> 01:05:08,105
now they may have different behaviors and if their individual particles

717
01:05:08,105 --> 01:05:13,465
and so that can confuse our understanding.

718
01:05:13,465 --> 01:05:18,825
all these particles behavior near Sue. those of you specially

719
01:05:18,825 --> 01:05:23,945
industrial hygiene. know that we talked about Aero dynamic air dynamic

720
01:05:23,945 --> 01:05:29,765
diameter of the particle. alright so to try to project how how

721
01:05:29,765 --> 01:05:35,105
rapidly and they settle out. as an example. what we talk about. yeah no materials

722
01:05:35,105 --> 01:05:40,639
are so small and then they conform these requirements that can

723
01:05:40,639 --> 01:05:46,319
in a very confusing way confuse the picture in our ability to predict what happens

724
01:05:46,319 --> 01:05:51,539
to these materials. somebody mentioned that. some studies

725
01:05:51,539 --> 01:05:56,759
actually said yes. some of these materials can enter the body through even

726
01:05:56,759 --> 01:06:02,619
in tact skin. and there's there's controversy about whether

727
01:06:02,619 --> 01:06:07,899
truly a tech scan is protective or only to damage skin. this stuff

728
01:06:07,899 --> 01:06:13,019
is hard to study. killer exposure. same thing.

729
01:06:13,019 --> 01:06:18,059
the listening surface of your cornea. did not protect you as

730
01:06:18,059 --> 01:06:23,761
rightly as in tax can nine alert service area but nonetheless

731
01:06:23,761 --> 01:06:28,861
there's a possibility for for deposition and exposure that

732
01:06:28,861 --> 01:06:34,521
way. if you want health stuff. you learn about these.

733
01:06:34,521 --> 01:06:40,341
you could still here he asked later in your longs that kinda bring mucus

734
01:06:40,341 --> 01:06:45,701
along with other debris. you call. you swallow. I know you

735
01:06:45,701 --> 01:06:50,721
just did. whenever not just mucus but other what might be in the mucus that

736
01:06:50,721 --> 01:06:55,761
you and handle that. it became apparent

737
01:06:55,761 --> 01:07:02,461
to the lining of your of your airways and so now you can just do this material.

738
01:07:02,461 --> 01:07:07,541
so and there's very little research on and just

739
01:07:07,541 --> 01:07:12,801
didn't know materials. actually this is like if you think

740
01:07:12,801 --> 01:07:18,541
that's bad enough. think about animal studies that suggest that these particles

741
01:07:18,541 --> 01:07:23,672
can be so small that would you and help him just like oxygen going from the old

742
01:07:23,672 --> 01:07:29,192
dealers to the E reason suspend that circulation. it's possible

743
01:07:29,192 --> 01:07:34,232
that these materials can into the blood stream and be trans located systematically

744
01:07:34,232 --> 01:07:39,492
and two other organs. animal studies that showed

745
01:07:39,492 --> 01:07:44,552
mental particles depositing in the nasal view coast able to inches of

746
01:07:44,552 --> 01:07:49,552
rain along the factory nerves and that conducts sense of smell to the

747
01:07:49,552 --> 01:07:54,992
brain little bit like science fiction right. so these are

748
01:07:54,992 --> 01:08:00,152
suggestions Scotty's dad. there maybe a problem here. but we know very little

749
01:08:00,152 --> 01:08:07,492
about the after toxicity of these kinds of exposure ropes.

750
01:08:07,492 --> 01:08:12,672
so this is concept that decreased particle size link and

751
01:08:12,672 --> 01:08:18,052
the service area the particle. maybe a better area. that are metric for measuring

752
01:08:18,052 --> 01:08:23,226
exposure and in the fact is one of the reasons why the number you will have

753
01:08:23,226 --> 01:08:28,506
such active features via logically. is there a very high

754
01:08:28,506 --> 01:08:34,566
ratio of service. to to mass. so.

755
01:08:34,566 --> 01:08:39,846
so again this concept that you could have the same Master Card

756
01:08:39,846 --> 01:08:44,986
material in the macro state versus Nano state

757
01:08:44,986 --> 01:08:50,226
in the Nano state because of the service to mass. high service the master

758
01:08:50,226 --> 01:08:57,486
issue is much more reactive and much more likely to cause an adverse fact.

759
01:08:57,486 --> 01:09:04,486
so based on that. the study suggest that if you and he'll alter fine particles.

760
01:09:04,486 --> 01:09:09,806
they have the size kinda affected toxicity equally if not more so than even

761
01:09:09,806 --> 01:09:14,966
the chemical composition of the material. so maybe less to do with what

762
01:09:14,966 --> 01:09:20,086
the chemical the Adams are in there as opposed to the actual

763
01:09:20,086 --> 01:09:25,244
particle science

764
01:09:25,244 --> 01:09:30,844
so that works confusing enough. you can take Reese Ned on materials

765
01:09:30,844 --> 01:09:35,904
and coat them. don't ask me what the cost and what I actually don't know. but you can call

766
01:09:35,904 --> 01:09:42,464
them and the properties. these materials can therefore be changed.

767
01:09:42,464 --> 01:09:47,824
so the service chemistry can be influence and so forth so if you have another dimension

768
01:09:47,824 --> 01:09:55,344
of complexity with respect to understanding the toxicity of these materials

769
01:09:55,344 --> 01:10:00,764
and so. well this is already a something upset that somebody is never skill materials

770
01:10:00,764 --> 01:10:06,544
can be distributed and unpredictable ways and

771
01:10:06,544 --> 01:10:12,124
there's certain evidence that certain particles materials. I have preferential

772
01:10:12,124 --> 01:10:17,164
distance disposition or deposition in certain organ else

773
01:10:17,164 --> 01:10:22,312
with in individual cells so here's

774
01:10:22,312 --> 01:10:28,652
some information based on animal studies. comparing asbestos

775
01:10:28,652 --> 01:10:33,832
and carbon tubes that they were similar signal and pathways

776
01:10:33,832 --> 01:10:38,912
with respect to the path apology and so in this

777
01:10:38,912 --> 01:10:44,032
particular study of pass is showing more greater greater policy.

778
01:10:44,032 --> 01:10:49,272
but it's a little bit scary then to think that somebody scanner carbon know to have

779
01:10:49,272 --> 01:10:55,452
similar biological pathways. had discussed us.

780
01:10:55,452 --> 01:11:00,932
so this other study. anybody know about titanium dioxide.

781
01:11:00,932 --> 01:11:05,952
very very common stuff it's still white and white paint. it's use and lots of

782
01:11:05,952 --> 01:11:11,032
application sun screens. foods cosmetics. taking Dock Side and

783
01:11:11,032 --> 01:11:16,852
a_lot_of materials. so nano or alter fine size

784
01:11:16,852 --> 01:11:22,546
titanium dioxide showing animals to call is pulmonary information

785
01:11:22,546 --> 01:11:28,146
and responses. Edwards responses in your old system.

786
01:11:28,146 --> 01:11:34,646
alter fine titanium dioxide again. any animals were carbon black more inflammatory.

787
01:11:34,646 --> 01:11:39,646
then titanium oxide or carbon black on last Joe's basis. so

788
01:11:39,646 --> 01:11:44,866
again the same in cereal. but if it's in the small nano size.

789
01:11:44,866 --> 01:11:49,966
more likely to be in in inflammatory. then on non- dental size and

790
01:11:49,966 --> 01:11:54,966
that carbon Nano tubes are shown to be you know toxic. can

791
01:11:54,966 --> 01:12:02,126
transform long at the sealed legal cells. potentially suggesting

792
01:12:02,126 --> 01:12:07,266
development of partial Genesis. just got a

793
01:12:07,266 --> 01:12:12,806
looking at this single wall carbon no tubes and multi wall

794
01:12:12,806 --> 01:12:17,966
covering into to pulmonary exposure. invoice is showing

795
01:12:17,966 --> 01:12:23,126
cute and chronic systemic responses and cardiovascular. so when

796
01:12:23,126 --> 01:12:28,526
you get to air pollution. one of the pain Halifax the.

797
01:12:28,526 --> 01:12:33,766
certain components of air pollution outdoor air pollution. are the cardiovascular

798
01:12:33,766 --> 01:12:38,906
fix or increase risk for cardiovascular disease. as an example.

799
01:12:38,906 --> 01:12:43,926
so Visa card note to another single or multi wall.

800
01:12:43,926 --> 01:12:49,406
as well as carbon dental fighters. greater equal or greater purpose calling

801
01:12:49,406 --> 01:12:54,806
L Andrews Halifax and lab animals. pulmonary information

802
01:12:54,806 --> 01:13:01,040
fibrosis. so like still a closer specials scarring in the wheeler

803
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:06,600
portion of the lawn. compared with other in here particles.

804
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:11,860
like to look at in this process.

805
01:13:11,860 --> 01:13:16,980
so there were some gimme a shout Easter mostly quite limited

806
01:13:16,980 --> 01:13:22,840
in terms. terms of the volume of the research.

807
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:28,560
in this case workers exposed to aerosol. some

808
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:34,780
small but not the name skill and also alter fine never in the skill particles.

809
01:13:34,780 --> 01:13:40,660
people have shown that documents and lung function structure. one disease

810
01:13:40,660 --> 01:13:46,340
like asthma. but also if I brought up on diseases and of course if you've already learned.

811
01:13:46,340 --> 01:13:51,540
if I brought long disease is causing scarring in the dealer in your area. we

812
01:13:51,540 --> 01:13:56,720
call restricted one sees you know a smaller scars long that's not here

813
01:13:56,720 --> 01:14:01,905
the last so

814
01:14:01,905 --> 01:14:06,945
as I say a_lot more to know a_lot more to learn about

815
01:14:06,945 --> 01:14:14,405
the health of sex. okay. so

816
01:14:14,405 --> 01:14:19,485
you know I look at those lines about the scale. then the materials compare to

817
01:14:19,485 --> 01:14:24,845
non- outside materials just kinda try to cement in your minds.

818
01:14:24,845 --> 01:14:30,105
what we're talking about. we're talking about engineered human engineered materials

819
01:14:30,105 --> 01:14:35,145
and the size that have very unusual properties based

820
01:14:35,145 --> 01:14:40,245
on their side stairs. their surface to mass

821
01:14:40,245 --> 01:14:45,365
ration or service or billing ratio. that size is so critical in terms

822
01:14:45,365 --> 01:14:51,245
of both exposure trans location and lots of unknown.

823
01:14:51,245 --> 01:14:56,741
send some suggestions of folks. so service very very important

824
01:14:56,741 --> 01:15:01,941
you just said that in terms of service to mass ratio. and there's a_lot that

825
01:15:01,941 --> 01:15:07,401
we don't know. and of course

826
01:15:07,401 --> 01:15:12,701
you know the information that's available. we suspect

827
01:15:12,701 --> 01:15:18,841
for major extra exposure routes maybe but there's a_lot more to learn

828
01:15:18,841 --> 01:15:24,361
and keep in mind that we're talking about issues your range of different

829
01:15:24,361 --> 01:15:30,621
materials made up of different Adams elements and so forth.

830
01:15:30,621 --> 01:15:36,741
with a variety of service County codings that can really lead to a very confusing

831
01:15:36,741 --> 01:15:41,861
world of potential exposures and they're making

832
01:15:41,861 --> 01:15:46,881
more new and different and materials all the time. the goal obviously

833
01:15:46,881 --> 01:15:51,941
is not to have another horrendous experience like the world

834
01:15:51,941 --> 01:15:57,161
experience in this field experience was this past years. where we get ahead of the game.

835
01:15:57,161 --> 01:16:02,693
this concept of the outside precautionary principal

836
01:16:02,693 --> 01:16:09,213
which I think some of you've heard of and we'll hear more about this course is

837
01:16:09,213 --> 01:16:14,273
that. if we have no reason to believe that there could be serious

838
01:16:14,273 --> 01:16:19,453
health effects that we take precautions to prevent exposure. resident finding

839
01:16:19,453 --> 01:16:24,513
out perhaps even years or decades later that we shouldn't know if permitted.

840
01:16:24,513 --> 01:16:40,973
would be great exposure that we have. so question.

841
01:16:40,973 --> 01:16:46,213
so the physical work environment. next class is really about hot and cold environment

842
01:16:46,213 --> 01:16:51,653
since only about twenty five minutes. so they'll be probably close to one hour.

843
01:16:51,653 --> 01:16:56,733
to refuse to remind Emily that was the plan.

844
01:16:56,733 --> 01:17:02,193
alright. bye just woke up.

845
01:17:02,193 --> 01:17:07,413
any other questions or comments. okay.

846
01:17:07,413 --> 01:17:12,553
thanks for all your attention and I'll see you next Tuesday.

847
01:17:12,553 --> 01:17:25,162
and I'm calling Herman Sandy
