00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:06,053
This is a brief review of the role of very low density lipoproteins in triglyceride

2
00:00:06,053 --> 00:00:07,570
trafficking.

3
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:10,560
We talked about several types of lipoproteins in this class.

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:15,086
And in this video I'm gonna focus on very low density lipoproteins which function to

5
00:00:15,086 --> 00:00:19,310
take triglycerides from the liver to the other target tissues.

6
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:23,236
Now as a reminder, lipoproteins and lipoprotein particles are the way that we

7
00:00:23,236 --> 00:00:26,746
transport triglycerides, which are by their own nature insoluble,

8
00:00:26,746 --> 00:00:29,880
through the blood so that they can reach other tissues.

9
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,169
They're comprised of a triglyceride and cholesteryl ester core,

10
00:00:33,169 --> 00:00:36,398
a phospholipid outer layer which has some free cholesterol in it,

11
00:00:36,398 --> 00:00:41,260
and apolipoproteins, which are proteins that coat the outside of these particles.

12
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:45,612
These apolipoproteins are important so that the cell that the proteins come

13
00:00:45,612 --> 00:00:49,828
in contact with can detect what kind of particle it is and decide whether or

14
00:00:49,828 --> 00:00:51,467
not it should respond to it.

15
00:00:51,467 --> 00:00:54,488
There are several types of apolipoproteins, chylomicrons,

16
00:00:54,488 --> 00:00:57,965
which are the lipoproteins that transport triglycerides from the gut to

17
00:00:57,965 --> 00:01:01,448
the liver and to other tissues, are the first type that we talked about.

18
00:01:01,448 --> 00:01:05,070
But in this lecture we're gonna focus on very low density lipoproteins.

19
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:08,229
As you can see, they're still very rich and triglycerides, and

20
00:01:08,229 --> 00:01:10,814
they're quite a bit smaller than chylomicrons, yet

21
00:01:10,814 --> 00:01:14,050
still much bigger than low and high density lipoproteins.

22
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:17,661
They're also less dense, which means they have more of a tendency to float,

23
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:21,570
because of their enrichment of triglycerides.

24
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:24,543
Very low density lipoproteins are generated in the liver and

25
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:26,291
they're synthesized as nascent,

26
00:01:26,291 --> 00:01:30,000
very low density lipoprotein particles within the liver cell.

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,153
These are then secreted into the blood,

28
00:01:32,153 --> 00:01:36,272
where they can then acquire the other apolipoprotein particles shown here,

29
00:01:36,272 --> 00:01:39,522
that turns them into a mature very low density lipoprotein.

30
00:01:39,522 --> 00:01:42,979
These particles can then travel through the bloodstream to particular target

31
00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:45,980
tissues that might be in need of these triglycerides.

32
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:50,153
In order for the triglycerides to get into the cell, they need to have the action

33
00:01:50,153 --> 00:01:54,452
of an enzyme called lipoprotein lipase, which is gonna take the triglycerides,

34
00:01:54,452 --> 00:01:59,580
convert it into fatty acids, and allow for fatty acid uptake.

35
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:02,410
The lipoprotein lipase is made inside some cells.

36
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:05,734
So for example, this could be an adipocyte, but

37
00:02:05,734 --> 00:02:09,300
is then secreted into the external face of the cell,

38
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:14,429
where it is able to enzymatically act on the very low density lipoprotein.

39
00:02:14,429 --> 00:02:18,466
The apolipoprotein CII, which is a component of the VLDL particle,

40
00:02:18,466 --> 00:02:23,338
helps to activate lipoprotein lipase so that when the very low density lipoprotein

41
00:02:23,338 --> 00:02:27,236
particle comes in contact with lipoprotein lipase, it allows for

42
00:02:27,236 --> 00:02:30,630
hydrolysis of the triglyceride to occur.

43
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:34,725
Once this hydrolysis happens, the fatty acids can enter into the adipocyte,

44
00:02:34,725 --> 00:02:37,828
where they can be esterified into triglycerides again, or

45
00:02:37,828 --> 00:02:42,590
they can transfer into the muscle, where they might be oxidized for fuel.

46
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:48,357
The remaining particle, which is now going to be largely depleted of triglycerides,

47
00:02:48,357 --> 00:02:50,885
and is relatively cholesterol rich,

48
00:02:50,885 --> 00:02:54,760
is taken back up by the liver as a low density lipoprotein.

49
00:02:54,760 --> 00:03:00,270
To review, very low density lipoproteins are made in the liver.

50
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:05,290
They traffic full of triglycerides to other tissues.

51
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:08,556
Lipoprotein lipase breaks down the triglycerides to allow for

52
00:03:08,556 --> 00:03:09,608
fatty acid uptake.

53
00:03:09,608 --> 00:03:13,550
And the remaining particle gets taken back up into the liver.

54
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:17,593
This is a very important process, cuz the liver where these triglycerides start is

55
00:03:17,593 --> 00:03:21,420
a very poor storage tissue for lipids relative to adipose tissue.

56
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:25,346
The VLDL system allows for liver triglycerides to be taken out of the liver

57
00:03:25,346 --> 00:03:29,588
and moved to target tissues where they can either be stored long-term, such as

58
00:03:29,588 --> 00:03:34,700
adipose tissue, or they can be used for fuel, such as muscle in the heart.

59
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:38,312
Any defects in the system would make lipids build up inside the liver, and

60
00:03:38,312 --> 00:03:41,331
that can lead to a disease called non-alcoholic fatty liver.
