1
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:34,740
Hey, good morning, everyone. Welcome back. Good to see you all.

2
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:39,960
Hopefully, you were able to enjoy some sort of a holiday break.

3
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,430
Maybe it was full of celebrations.

4
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:50,430
Maybe it was just like complete downtime to kind of recover or catch up or get ready for the home stretch here on the end of the semester.

5
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:59,160
I just wanted to pull up the calendar quickly. We truly are in the homestretch and the classes for the university is next Friday.

6
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:10,770
So two more weeks, less than two weeks and then hopefully after a strong finish, you guys will get a well-deserved extended break.

7
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:21,930
Today, we're going to go over topics around climate and energy and their impacts on health on Thursday.

8
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:29,730
We'll actually start our first round of student debates and the structure for for

9
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:36,000
Thursday will be I'll prepare a short lecture around issues of indoor air quality.

10
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,840
I'll try to be as timely as possible and get out of the way and leave the podium to air to debate.

11
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:52,320
Teams won't go ahead and go through that debate process just to kind of remind folks, the Pro Group, this is the format for all three of the debates.

12
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,600
The Pro Group will have 10 minutes to present.

13
00:01:54,600 --> 00:02:00,410
You'll all be invited to come up to the podium, you know, have your presentation ready to go up on the screen.

14
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:07,980
I'll join everyone else in the seats and be a participant as well.

15
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:14,820
The group will then have 10 minutes. We'll have like a two minute pause at the end of both formal presentations.

16
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:25,470
I'll find that I think just, you know, one group can have out into the back hallway here to kind of huddle up and come up with your rebuttal.

17
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:27,900
Another group can kind of just walk out into the front hallway.

18
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:32,650
And that way you have a little bit of privacy and you're strategizing and come up with your rebuttal.

19
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:38,460
I'll kind of invite both groups back in. We'll do two minutes, we'll do two minutes.

20
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:39,450
Then we're going to have some, uh,

21
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:47,850
some voting from the class to think who won the debate separate from winners and losers of the debate itself on the issue.

22
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:55,100
What do folks think you know, in favor against and so forth and have a little bit of time for discussion?

23
00:02:55,100 --> 00:03:01,870
Uh, any any questions about about that debate format?

24
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:09,690
I have more of a look at the technical question. Sure. When you presented like a PowerPoint on there, are you able to see like the notes section?

25
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:18,510
I think it's a setting that I don't know if I could draw the line.

26
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:21,900
I personally use a Mac and I know how to do it.

27
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:31,990
I mean that I just think of the look with the way that the yeah, I mean, this is a PC, like a Windows based system you are.

28
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:33,370
I don't know if you have access to one,

29
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:40,850
otherwise you're welcome to step in here any time that there's not a class and just mess around with that object.

30
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:45,000
Yeah, I unfortunately, I'm not the I mean, I can look at some settings here.

31
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,130
Anybody like a Windows person who knows exactly how to do this in PowerPoint.

32
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:55,470
I would think you'd be able to be using PowerPoint or Google Slides. Just he just couldn't handle it.

33
00:03:55,470 --> 00:04:00,910
I don't know. I think be some sort of. Yeah, I do like the way that projected the whole screen capture.

34
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:07,710
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Let's see.

35
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:16,120
So a good question. Sorry, I don't have a better answer. Anything else that comes to mind with regards to the debates themselves.

36
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:24,120
And if you want just to like, turn it in like the night before, I forget, like when you want to turn it down and whatnot it, it's up to you.

37
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,680
And like, I used to ask people that just send it to me before class.

38
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:36,780
And oftentimes people are using PowerPoint, and I would kind of try to have it prep just to save time.

39
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:42,210
In more recent years, people are using shared files and whatever the whole access thing and logging in,

40
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:46,890
and it's easier just to have the group come up and pull up their file and start that way.

41
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:54,540
So in terms of a requirement, send it to me on that day even after your presentation.

42
00:04:54,540 --> 00:05:02,250
Like there's there's no hurry. I'll, of course, be able to review it when I'm doing my own scoring or evaluation or whatever.

43
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:09,030
It's more just the logistics. If if you have like a an easily accessed file that you want to like,

44
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:13,590
send to me as an attachment and I can have it just kind of prepped before class starts.

45
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:18,120
I'm happy to do that, but it's not a requirement at all. Thank you.

46
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:26,330
Yeah. Any other questions?

47
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:35,570
All right, I'm excited for the debate. They're going to be fine going back to this just as they're using it as a calendar.

48
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:40,130
You should have all received and this is relevant to this class, the relevant ordered classes.

49
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:50,630
You should have received an invite to complete course evaluations, think it's through the blue system or something like that.

50
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:57,140
And so I wanted to strongly encourage you to do that, not just for this course, but for all of your all of your courses.

51
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:05,060
They generally don't. Don't take too much time. They are extremely valuable to me personally.

52
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:10,550
For this class. I will absolutely value whatever feedback and comments you can provide.

53
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:16,010
You know, both both positive and, you know, areas that you think the course could be improved.

54
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:24,830
I truly utilize it and implement it going forward in the next offering of the course and that that feedback is especially valuable.

55
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:30,410
You know, kind of during the pandemic and with all the constraints and logistics and management issues.

56
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:35,870
So I'd really appreciate your feedback as a little bit of incentive to complete that.

57
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:43,550
Actually, let me take a step back. Not all of you, but I know many of you this is this might be your first semester at Michigan.

58
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:49,040
So your first time submitting these course evaluations. So not just for this course, for all of your courses.

59
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:53,600
Just so folks are clear whenever you submit your evaluation.

60
00:06:53,600 --> 00:07:02,750
The instructor can't doesn't have access to it until after the semester is ended, and they have submitted all final grades for the course.

61
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:08,570
So just so you know that that's the case.

62
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:18,170
And then as the incentive, since we do have a class participation component in this course, I don't actually see either somewhere in canvas.

63
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:24,110
I can see how many course evaluations have been completed, but I don't know who's completed them.

64
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:28,880
So instead of doing it one by one, I'm going to set a bar.

65
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:37,520
And if we can hit 90 percent, which there's 22 students enrolled, so that means we could go with two not submitting it.

66
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:44,390
But don't be one of those to try not to be. If we hit the 90 percent mark, I can give everyone like an additional class participation.

67
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:51,410
So it's so it's 10 percent right at your fourth grade. I can add one percent to everyone's if we did that 90 percent bar.

68
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:54,560
But again, I don't actually see, you know, who is who is completing it.

69
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,090
I just kind of get a report of how many people are. They are open for quite a while.

70
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:06,640
I think it goes into at least the last day of classes, which is which is next Friday.

71
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:18,990
Any any questions about the the course evaluations? And not just for this class, but for the whole concept.

72
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:31,490
All right, sounds good. So let's go ahead and get into today's topic.

73
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:35,180
So with regard to the climate and energy goals for today,

74
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:41,570
are we able to to go over the major sources of the energy production that we

75
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:48,230
sort of demand and then those resulting health effects that come along with it?

76
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:56,870
We want to gain an understanding of the history and some of the scientific background and greenhouse gases specifically,

77
00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:05,990
and then be able to look at some of the global data that's observed that kind of helps inform us around these climate change issues.

78
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:16,490
And then, you know, gain an understanding of not just the present, but looking into the future and where, you know, some of our concerns might lie.

79
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:21,600
All right, so this is, I don't know, probably the third or fourth time I've showed this slide again, right?

80
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:29,030
So we've talked about urban smog in terms of PM and ozone, you know, primarily in urban areas.

81
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:36,230
Huge problem driven by fossil fuel emissions. You referenced a little bit, actually, I think and look, what's your next Tuesday?

82
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:40,160
I'll touch more specifically on some aspects of mercury,

83
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:49,670
but atmospheric deposition of things like mercury and persistent organic pollutants are driven primarily by fossil fuel emissions.

84
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:53,990
We're going to talk on Thursday about indoor air quality issues.

85
00:09:53,990 --> 00:10:02,810
Much of that is driven by fossil fuel emissions. And then, of course, today we're talking about in the climate and energy and climate change.

86
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:08,390
And again, these greenhouse gas emissions are almost entirely driven by fossil fuel emissions.

87
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:16,190
So that's kind of a punch line up front. We've looked at this slide as well, even though,

88
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:23,870
you know there are efforts towards renewable sources of energy and we're making some progress as a globe.

89
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:32,720
We're going to be living with and dealing with fossil fuel emissions at least over the coming couple of decades.

90
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:42,650
When we look a little bit at how that breaks out kind of both historically and then going forward projecting in time,

91
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:48,770
you know, basically the way to interpret this plot is the orange part of the bar are from high income countries.

92
00:10:48,770 --> 00:11:00,620
So this would be energy consumption by high income countries in the orange and yellow colored bar is basically middle and low income countries.

93
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:10,580
And this is where the projection for that, that energy demand and consumption is expected to just continue to grow over the coming decades.

94
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:23,000
And the challenge is that as countries develop their socioeconomic development, you know, primarily income at a household level,

95
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:33,140
going from low and middle to high, there's a very well described and documented energy ladder that comes along with that.

96
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:47,090
So low income countries are relying on very basic sources of fuel crop residue, animal dung, wood, charcoal.

97
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:56,870
And it's not until you get all the way up to the top of that energy ladder with high socioeconomic development that you're talking about,

98
00:11:56,870 --> 00:12:00,590
you know, nuclear renewable sources of energy and so forth.

99
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:11,930
So there's a very heavy demand on the fossil fuels on the lower and middle part of that energy ladder.

100
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:21,860
Looking specifically at coal consumption, we're kind of piecing things out, looking at bike by country grouping.

101
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:26,750
Again, a little bit back in time, but then projecting into the future.

102
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:31,880
We've got China here in this orange color, India and I, my colors are terrible.

103
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:37,940
What is that even called like aqua and perhaps the U.S. and this blue color?

104
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:45,500
And then basically everybody else, all other countries in this yellow color and again, coal consumption,

105
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:52,460
even though we're, you know, we're making progress in different phases, bring cleaner coal.

106
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:57,710
You know, some coal fired power plants are being sunset. There's still coal plants being built.

107
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:04,010
You know, all over the world presently today.

108
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:14,150
And then, you know, why should we be worried about coal? Absolutely. Um, this is this is hitting on a couple of different pollutants.

109
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:16,070
So when the yellow,

110
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:25,850
it's giving us an indication of how much emissions that each of these pollutants comes from all power plants that generate electricity.

111
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:29,690
And as you can see, it's a pretty high fraction of those pollutants.

112
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:39,350
So almost 40 percent of carbon dioxide this is in the US is emitted from power plants.

113
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:44,180
A little over 60 percent of the sulfur dioxide comes from power plants.

114
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:48,860
About a quarter of the nitrogen oxides come from power plants.

115
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:53,540
And maybe about a third of the mercury emissions come from power plants.

116
00:13:53,540 --> 00:14:01,250
The orange bars tell us how much of those emissions from power plants are coming specifically from coal-fired power plants.

117
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:09,470
Right. So as you can see, the orange bar is, you know, greater than 90 percent of the yellow bar and almost all of these instances.

118
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:17,170
So it's really the coal combustion. It's the primary driver of these emissions.

119
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:26,620
In terms of some of the impacts, this is more of a of an overview slide, we're going to go into a fair amount of detail here over the next little bit.

120
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:33,820
But when we look at these major sources of energy and their impact on both, you know, human health as well as psychological health.

121
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,770
Again, it's, you know, the takeaway message here.

122
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:48,160
It's it's primarily driven by fossil fuel rates, but not for petroleum, coal, natural gas, biomass, you know, both outdoors as well as indoors.

123
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,660
You know, a variety of impacts directly on human health.

124
00:14:52,660 --> 00:15:02,420
And then, you know, kind of ecological impacts that also translate indirectly to impacts on human health and well-being as well.

125
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:10,390
I'm kind of curious of how is the hydropower increase in malaria and other bacterial diseases from the formation of the lakes?

126
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:19,750
Yeah, right, right. And management of it. Um, it's, you know, an interesting and I don't have any slides prepared on it.

127
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:25,240
We're going to add some references to talking about climate change issues and obviously drought.

128
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:28,780
But just in recent years, I mean, two years,

129
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:39,130
if we go to the western part of the U.S. and look at the hydrological effects from from hydropower with with

130
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:49,510
these reservoirs being just depleted right massively and to the point that it's barely creating electricity,

131
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:58,630
that's clearly not, not sustainable. And then right, the impact on on fisheries and so forth.

132
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:05,740
But but uh, yeah. And remind me, as we're going through the slides that there might be an easy way to kind of like segue way back around to it.

133
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:16,250
I can't recall if there's something more specific. There are some slides towards the end talking about, uh, vector borne disease, for sure.

134
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:21,310
Uh, okay. So let's take a step back and just make sure we're all on the same page.

135
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:25,810
So everyone's heard of the greenhouse effect. Right? But I want to ask you to describe it.

136
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:31,240
Right. So I just want to make sure that we're all able to to describe exactly what this means.

137
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:39,430
And we've talked actually a little bit about some aspects of this in terms of the Earth's energy balance, right?

138
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:46,460
When we're talking about air pollution and vertical mixing and temperature inversions and things like that, right?

139
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:54,970
So it's kind of picking up with that level of understanding, but then applying it to the greenhouse gases and the effects that they have.

140
00:16:54,970 --> 00:17:03,490
So as we talked about before, right, we have this incident sunlight coming in that reaches the Earth's surface.

141
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:12,580
Most of that radiation is absorbed right by the Earth's surface, warms it and then the surface starts to give that heat off, right?

142
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:18,340
So from the surface up and we have these and parcels of air that solar radiation,

143
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:24,460
some of it actually gets reflected through the atmosphere and back out to space,

144
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:34,990
but also an increasing proportion of it is being absorbed within the lower atmosphere by these greenhouse gases.

145
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:44,390
And that's what is contributing to a warming atmosphere and a warming global mean surface temperature by design,

146
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:51,460
uh, without anthropogenic emissions and increases in CO2 and other greenhouse gases.

147
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:57,070
We actually rely on the greenhouse effect to allow us to have sustainable life here on Earth.

148
00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:02,620
This just from kind of natural levels of greenhouse gases.

149
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:10,820
This effect keeps the surface of the Earth about 33 degrees Celsius warmer than it otherwise would be.

150
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:18,550
Right. So if you want I mean, it's cold, snowy outside, but let's let's take off thirty three degrees Celsius and try to manage things.

151
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:24,400
So it's really a benefit kind of by design to allow us to function.

152
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:35,610
But we're going to talk here about how, you know, the increases through through human activities are really stressing this Earth system.

153
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:46,620
All right. So when we talk about changing climate and we look back historically at some data,

154
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:52,530
how do we know these things and what are we looking at and what's the basis of how we're interpreting it?

155
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:59,040
So starting with the figure over here on the right, we're looking at the last 1000 years.

156
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:14,580
And this is specific to the northern hemisphere and it's looking at data in the departure in temperature from a 30 year average from 1961 to 1990.

157
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:24,060
Right. So you take that that average global mean surface temperature for the northern hemisphere from 1961 to 1990.

158
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:35,820
And here it is. And then you go back in time and look at, OK, what was the Earth's mean surface temperature in relation to that?

159
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:39,210
So going back a thousand years, it was less than that.

160
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:46,320
It was a point two degrees cooler than it was from 1961 to 1990.

161
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:52,920
And it was cooler. It was cooler with cooler. It was cooler for a long time.

162
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:58,980
Excuse me until about this period right here.

163
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:01,680
Right. And so if we try to extrapolate down,

164
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:11,820
this is like the early 1800s and we have this dramatic increase in global mean surface temperature in the northern hemisphere,

165
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:17,550
a little jog here and then another increase taking us higher.

166
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:23,910
The there's a blue line going back for most of this time period.

167
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:36,660
And then we kind of start to add this red line here. The distinction is that the Blue Line are estimates of using proxy data, whereas the red,

168
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:42,030
our actual direct measurements of temperature and using the student temperature sensors,

169
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:46,830
you know that that the people developed and started to record.

170
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:53,340
So what actually, what's the when we look at this, this blue line going back so far, what is that proxy data?

171
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:58,050
Where does that come from? Yeah.

172
00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:01,610
Don't they do samples are bringing out their oxygen and ice cores.

173
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:06,470
Exactly. Yeah. So ice core data you can you can date right?

174
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:17,000
The depth of the core and looking at radioactive decay of different isotopes, you can estimate what surface temperature was.

175
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,380
And so that is how all of this data is constructed.

176
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:29,060
Going back in time and actually that that continues right to the blue line here is continuing to use that core data.

177
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:34,070
And then the red is superimposed over top of it, which is the actual temperature measurements.

178
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:38,120
So if we take just the most recent, I don't know,

179
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:47,060
one hundred and fifty years or so at the end of this plot on the right that then that's what we're looking at here on the left.

180
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:51,980
So this is only looking at the last 140 years. It's no longer the northern hemisphere.

181
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:57,870
It's it's global. So this is the entire globe. Same comparison, right?

182
00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:04,920
So its reference comparison to the 30 year average from 1961 to 1990.

183
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:12,800
So that's here the zero line. And then what was mean, surface temperature in relation to that over time?

184
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:18,440
So back in 1860, right, it was about minus 0.4 degrees.

185
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:22,250
It's been increasing. It's been increasing. It's been increasing up.

186
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:32,410
Here's that little bit of a jog. And then in the most recent decades, it's really began to ramp up.

187
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:36,250
Some similar data, but then adding to it.

188
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:46,480
So in the backdrop, this red line again is that global mean surface temperature going back about a thousand years.

189
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:54,640
Right. And it's really those last hundred and fifty years or so that you see a dramatic increase with that plotted next to it in this

190
00:22:54,640 --> 00:23:05,290
brown trend is looking at CO2 concentrations over that same time line again with about the last hundred and fifty years or so,

191
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:16,450
you know, huge increases. This, of course, is coming with, you know, the industrial revolution, our use of fossil fuels for energy and transportation.

192
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:24,880
The plot in the foreground here is looking specifically at that carbon emissions and then importantly,

193
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:31,120
adding in the fraction of those carbon emissions from fossil fuels and kind of the salmon color.

194
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,000
And as you can see, right, a large percent, you know,

195
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:44,220
basically all of that increase is driven by the addition of fossil fuels over that most recent time period.

196
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:57,600
Looking at much more recent data, this is from the US EPA, I guess start over here on the left with greenhouse gases.

197
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:07,320
So if we look at them by type of gas, a little over three quarters of greenhouse gas emissions are attributed to CO2,

198
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:15,480
the carbon dioxide within a significant fraction as well of methane and nitrous oxide.

199
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:18,000
If we look over here at the right,

200
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:27,930
we begin to kind of break down or get an idea of what type of emissions source sectors are contributing to these emissions.

201
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:39,570
We have, you know, about a quarter coming from energy supply, a decent amount from transportation and industry, agriculture and forestry practices.

202
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:44,730
And then in terms of, you know, regionally looking at how it's divided up,

203
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:53,580
this is listing individual nations right and how much of it specific to CO2 from fossil fuel combustion.

204
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:59,430
About a quarter from China. Another 20 percent or so from the US.

205
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:01,780
Another quarter or so from the European Union.

206
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:11,220
So, you know, maybe two thirds of the global CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion are coming from the combination of China,

207
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:23,390
the US and Europe within, you know, notable contributions from India, from Russia, Japan and Canada.

208
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:28,670
All right, so there is this Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,

209
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:40,970
the IPCC who meets every couple of years to basically scour every peer-reviewed publication, analyze, synthesize and come to conclusions.

210
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:47,750
And very interestingly, these are consensus conclusions, and I'll talk about a little bit more about the IPCC in a minute.

211
00:25:47,750 --> 00:26:00,830
But the take home message for the last maybe eight years or so has been the following that there's very strong evidence that most of the warming

212
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:09,860
that we've observed across the Earth's surface over the last hundred and fifty years is directly attributable to those human activities,

213
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:17,720
and that warming in the last 1000 years is unusual and unlikely to be entirely natural in origin.

214
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:24,890
And that natural forces alone can't explain the recent substantial warming over the most recent decades.

215
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:33,680
And those, again, those consensus conclusions and these are really the important take homes that forced us to consider all kinds of

216
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:45,020
dynamics are that that global mean temperature and global sea level will continue to rise under all future scenarios.

217
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:53,030
And we'll look at some of those model scenarios here in a minute. But you know, the worst case is that we continue to increase emissions.

218
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:56,270
That's a bad future in terms of projections.

219
00:26:56,270 --> 00:27:02,360
But even if we had some magic to just turn off the faucet immediately and just cut out all emissions today,

220
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:14,240
we still have a lot to manage because of what's already been done historically in terms of impact on climate going forward for several decades.

221
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:25,340
OK. Right, so, uh, you know, over the last, I don't know, twenty years you might have heard global warming climate change being like a debate, right?

222
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:34,580
Is it real? Is it not? I mean, just, you know, kind of stated that that debate was over some years ago.

223
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:44,800
This IPCC, which is composed at 2013, was composed of two hundred and fifty nine authors representing thirty nine different countries.

224
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:49,220
These are all expert scientists in their field doing this review.

225
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:56,420
Providing this synthesis report, uh, reached consensus on these conclusions.

226
00:27:56,420 --> 00:28:02,900
Again, the warming of our climate system has been unequivocally confirmed and linked directly to human activity.

227
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:11,240
And it is interesting that at the time that this report was being published was also another study that found that

228
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:18,460
climate change might have affected about one half of extreme weather events that occurred in the preceding year.

229
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:24,440
And we'll talk about some of those extreme weather events here in a few minutes.

230
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:27,840
So I mentioned some of those projections, right?

231
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:41,300
So here is reorient ourselves again. So variations in temperature over that last, you know, one thousand year period using the zero point from 1990.

232
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:50,750
And you see the kind of bobbing and weaving a little bit below the zero line and then in recent decades, starting to increase.

233
00:28:50,750 --> 00:29:01,520
So then going forward, what are we looking at? This is a number of different emission case scenarios going forward, right?

234
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:09,110
We're increasing by a lot where status quo continuing with current emissions, we're able to make,

235
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:14,720
you know, fractional reductions in emissions all the way down to combines the best cases.

236
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:22,310
We've we've managed to somehow turn off that faucet and there are zero greenhouse gas emissions from human activities going forward.

237
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:27,590
And basically, that's the spread that you see up here at the top of this scenario.

238
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:32,330
And this is looking at, right? This is degree Celsius departure.

239
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:36,800
So we're currently above the zero line.

240
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:41,810
And the worst case scenario is that we continue to increase emissions and we end up some here in

241
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:49,310
this range of five to six degrees Celsius deviation increase in global mean surface temperature.

242
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:56,330
The best case if we're able to turn off the faucet right now and just cut out all emissions,

243
00:29:56,330 --> 00:30:01,880
you know, is that we maybe don't go above the 1.5 degrees Celsius.

244
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:12,980
So anyway, the takeaway here is that we have a lot to manage and deal with, regardless of the emissions scenario going forward looking.

245
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:20,990
So we're talking about ice core and global mean surface temperature, right, as indicators historically and as a way to project into the future.

246
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:27,050
Another really useful data source has been global mean sea level.

247
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:32,960
So this is looking at, you know, roughly that same time period in the last hundred and forty years or so,

248
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:42,590
starting at kind of a zero line for global mean surface level and just looking at the increases based on Typekit data.

249
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:47,600
There's the the bars around it represent uncertainty.

250
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:51,710
And then and most recent years, we were able to add satellite altimeter data.

251
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:53,600
That's where the red line comes in here.

252
00:30:53,600 --> 00:31:01,520
But you can see this steady and dramatic increase over the one hundred and forty year time of global mean sea level rise.

253
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:14,780
So this is as ice caps and glaciers, you know, melt that melting ice fills the ocean systems and overall increasing sea level.

254
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:29,120
Why is that a concern? Well, there's about 40 percent of the world's population that lives in relatively close proximity to two ocean coasts.

255
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:35,090
It's kind of hard to see in this plot. That's a plot of height above sea level.

256
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:43,640
The green means you're above it. Once you get down to the red, you're you're barely above it and super sensitive to any sea level rise.

257
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:51,770
And so you can kind of see as you follow along here at the coast, the reds and yellows and so forth across the globe.

258
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:58,190
What are those concerns? One is just simple, you know, inundation of seawater flooding.

259
00:31:58,190 --> 00:32:04,820
But another really important concern is salinization of coastal aquifers, right?

260
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:12,760
So freshwater drinking sources then now also become inundated by seawater and then that freshwater is.

261
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:22,490
No longer usable or as a resource. Any any questions so far, I feel like I'm flipping through like lots of data find.

262
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:30,330
I had a question. Yeah, like in your opinion, what scenario are we tracking like the recent big debate we had?

263
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:37,490
Everyone's like by 2050, 20 30, and that's still putting us off the worst case scenario in my mind.

264
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:42,810
Yeah, I think you're going to go back to this slide to talk about it.

265
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:47,540
Uh, yeah. In a nutshell, I think what you stated is it's pretty accurate.

266
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:58,310
We're going to talk about kind of like some some will finish by talking about some policy, uh, going back to the Rio Convention, the Kyoto Protocol,

267
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:08,300
um, the annual or during the pandemic, not quite an annual conference of parties to kind of revisit those conventions and try to improve upon them.

268
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:14,660
And yes, with each iteration, you know, the goals going in are ambitious.

269
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:21,260
And then, you know, the outcomes and results tend to not hit those ambitious marks or even come close.

270
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:23,840
Honestly, yeah,

271
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:31,760
I find really interesting because most scenarios that lead us being remaining under two degrees Celsius require negative emission technology,

272
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:38,580
which I've read and kind of covered, which none have been actually developed at scale, actually like because you have to build a base to do that.

273
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:43,840
And so. And he doesn't need to invest big time, right?

274
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:48,660
It's a great great observation. And we'll talk. It's a good point, actually. Thanks, Josh.

275
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:54,050
You know, we'll talk about strategies. We'll kind of finish with strategies. But there's there's two approaches to this.

276
00:33:54,050 --> 00:34:00,090
One is to mitigate by reducing emissions, right?

277
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:07,700
Another is to mitigate, by increasing things right as a way forward for removal technology.

278
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:12,090
And so what cut kind of finished by talking about that, but that thanks.

279
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:21,300
Sorry for a not a more optimistic answer, but I think that there are some more data here.

280
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:27,680
This is looking at high CO2 levels.

281
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:38,720
Again, those most recent decades, this is in the open Pacific Ocean, a monitor, you know, measuring atmospheric CO2 at an altitude.

282
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:46,460
This is the top the Mauna Loa volcano on the on the Big Island of Hawaii.

283
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:52,550
And so tracking that so it's not the purpose of making this high altitude measurement at an

284
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:56,270
island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean is that it's not impacted by local emissions,

285
00:34:56,270 --> 00:35:00,890
right? So this is truly representative of kind of like a hemispheric.

286
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:10,130
I mean, and again, it's a, you know, it's a very steady increase over those recent decades.

287
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:15,530
This isn't an animated, uh, pretty cool, actually.

288
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:23,690
This is from NASA, where they've mapped out changing temperature and it's hard to see the scale.

289
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:34,430
But you know, the take home is that, uh, blue is better and orange and red is worse in terms of warming temperatures.

290
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:38,960
But we've talked a lot so far about global mean surface temperature, right?

291
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:47,180
So that means like what's the average temperature around the globe or maybe the average temperature for the northern hemisphere?

292
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:58,850
This is this animation will highlight how it's yes, the mean is important and it's important to track and it's intuitive and instructive.

293
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:06,050
But the reality is that how the changing climate is impacting the Earth is not happening.

294
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:09,470
It's not happening, spread out on average across the Earth.

295
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:16,820
It's happening very regionally with quite a bit of variation in how one region is impacted versus another.

296
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:20,930
And we'll talk about some of the ways and how those impacts play out.

297
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:28,340
But the starting point here is kind of look at how those changing temperatures look regionally, and I'm going to play it a couple of times.

298
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:33,480
It starts in 1884 and it ends at, I think, 2010 11.

299
00:36:33,480 --> 00:37:06,120
It takes like, I don't know, 30 seconds or so. I'll do it twice. All right, so we ended 2011, and I'll play it again,

300
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:12,090
but it's really just those recent couple of decades where you see the oranges and reds really

301
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:44,050
come on strong and again with a with a heavier focus up here in the northern hemisphere.

302
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:53,290
OK, so just a couple of observations spatially here, so the largest deviation,

303
00:37:53,290 --> 00:37:59,770
the change in temperature right is happening in those polar regions does the most northern latitudes here in the southern hemisphere.

304
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:03,790
In the northern hemisphere. And similarly in the southern hemisphere, right?

305
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:13,510
This is where that unfortunate, very easy contribution in impact comes in two polar ice caps melting of those caps right into the oceans,

306
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:18,880
increasing sea level lots of downstream impacts.

307
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:25,240
But but otherwise, you know, if you look at continents, it's not, you know, it's not a smooth out average.

308
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:34,440
There are definite regional impacts, some areas being more strongly impacted by others in terms of the changing temperatures.

309
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:41,430
OK, right, so the point here is, you know, picking up on that animation is it's not just, you know,

310
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:47,550
on global warming was kind of the now kind of antiquated term used to describe this,

311
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:54,120
this concern that yes, it's true on average, the globe is warming.

312
00:38:54,120 --> 00:39:03,870
But the reality is, or the concern is really that the change in climate and it's not happening on average across the globe.

313
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:16,200
You you've no doubt heard comments from folks, whether it's in social media or people you know personally who say, Wait, you know,

314
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:23,970
we just had like a record cold temperature last February, you know, it was minus twenty five degrees, you know, it hasn't happened.

315
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:30,210
And then the hundred and fifty years we've been, you know, recording temperatures in Ann Arbor, whatever it is, right?

316
00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:33,270
How can there be? How can there be global warming?

317
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:39,660
And you know, the answer lies in some of this information here that it's really the change in climate.

318
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:46,980
And what's happening is that we're having larger extremes on both sides, right?

319
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:56,580
So this distribution of temperature is not only being shifted warmer, but it's also being, you know,

320
00:39:56,580 --> 00:40:04,530
flattened out so that we have a higher percentage of extremes, both in terms of hot as well as cold.

321
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:10,740
Um, I, you know, it's very much kind of like a meteorological climate exercise.

322
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:17,010
I don't have any slides prepared on it, but you, I'm sure, heard two terms about, oh, the polar vortex, right?

323
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:19,890
And oh my gosh, it's going to be freezing cold.

324
00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:29,280
And you know, this is the consequence of those polar ice caps melting is that the climate at the poles is change.

325
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,700
The meteorology, the meteorology at the poles is change.

326
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:42,330
So instead of keeping that cold air wound in a tight ball at the poles, it's allowing it to become kind of oblong and have dips in it,

327
00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:49,470
which allows that cold air to push in the northern hemisphere to push further south up to the more southern latitudes.

328
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:53,760
That's why we get those cold air intrusions at times.

329
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,460
You know, here it's happening in North America, as happened in Europe.

330
00:40:56,460 --> 00:41:02,100
And yes, for a couple of days you can get a record cold temperatures because that didn't used to happen.

331
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:10,890
All of that cold air, which kept over the poles, kept the ice caps and glaciers frozen.

332
00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:23,280
So, you know, I'm going to shift gears a little bit and start talking about water issues in terms of water as a resource and water scarcity concerns.

333
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:27,930
And there's a couple of different things, so every region is not affected the same.

334
00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:39,890
There are big differences. In general, the warmer the air is, the more moisture it's able to hold right before it precipitates out.

335
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:51,900
But the more moisture you have in the air, the better case you have for kind of like heavy rainfall, extreme precipitation events.

336
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:57,000
In some areas we have warm air. In some areas we have colder air.

337
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:04,680
So as you create these extremes on each end of that distribution, it's actually the difference on a regional scale,

338
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:09,450
the difference between warm air and cold air that drives the wind, right?

339
00:42:09,450 --> 00:42:15,570
So that that gradients between warm and cold. So we have higher amounts of wind.

340
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:22,620
We talked about the melting ice leading to higher sea level changing ocean currents.

341
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:27,780
So the reality is that some regions actually end up warmer,

342
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:34,590
while others are ending up colder on average, and some areas are ending up wetter than they used to be.

343
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:40,450
While some areas are ending up drier than they used to be.

344
00:42:40,450 --> 00:42:54,640
I mentioned water resources, so drought and melting of glaciers that serve as sources of fresh water are a concern.

345
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:58,960
And then, you know, water scarcity itself, it's not.

346
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:06,910
Maybe it already is becoming an issue on different scales.

347
00:43:06,910 --> 00:43:13,990
So, you know, there are parts of the globe, the Middle East, where, you know, water scarcity has been an issue for a long time now.

348
00:43:13,990 --> 00:43:26,530
But, but even in recent years, and it's kind of developed kind of politically actually even in the U.S. for how to manage water and water resources.

349
00:43:26,530 --> 00:43:35,470
So, you know, we're looking here at the end of the southwest U.S., as you know, being in extreme areas.

350
00:43:35,470 --> 00:43:39,920
And this is where this is a region that even though the climate is getting warmer and other areas,

351
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:44,560
we're getting weather and having, you know, flooding rains.

352
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:53,140
This part of the US is experiencing less rain right in drought, less snowfall, less snowmelt.

353
00:43:53,140 --> 00:44:00,280
And it's creating, you know, true water scarcity in the southwest U.S. And it's, you know,

354
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:06,610
it's gotten, unfortunately, a lot of coverage over the last just recent couple of years.

355
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:14,950
Uh, you know, leading to crazy amounts of wildfires in the western U.S. and wildfire smoke and exposure,

356
00:44:14,950 --> 00:44:19,990
you know, very quickly, we're talking about air pollution issues from this.

357
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:25,670
But it was actually going back to and politics are not my strong point, either.

358
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:29,320
I think it was like twenty seven twenty.

359
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:38,770
Yeah, I think it was 2007. So leading up to the 2008 presidential election, there was a candidate named Bill Richardson,

360
00:44:38,770 --> 00:44:44,520
who actually ran part of his platform or whatever ran on, and he's from the southwest.

361
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:52,720
US was building this pipeline from the Great Lakes to to the southwest U.S., right,

362
00:44:52,720 --> 00:45:03,580
as a way to whatever the growing population in the southwest and as you bring fresh water resources through anyway,

363
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:09,040
moving from water to food and agriculture. Uh, some areas.

364
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:15,250
And again, we kind of we've talked about the the western part of the U.S. and drought and wildfires,

365
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:21,040
and we've also heard about agricultural constraints and limitations for farming.

366
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:30,820
California has been hugely impacted just in recent years, right? There's not enough water in the reservoir systems to actually water crops.

367
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:38,290
And so yields are dramatically reduced. Cost of goods has dramatically increased.

368
00:45:38,290 --> 00:45:45,730
But it's not an across the board. It's not that agriculture is now adversely impacted everywhere.

369
00:45:45,730 --> 00:45:51,520
There are definite areas right here to the southwest US projects.

370
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:58,930
These are projections going out into the 2000 and 80s so, so several decades from now with,

371
00:45:58,930 --> 00:46:04,810
you know, dramatic reductions in agricultural productivity. And you can look across the globe here.

372
00:46:04,810 --> 00:46:05,710
But other areas,

373
00:46:05,710 --> 00:46:16,440
generally those that lie in kind of northern temperate climates because of that little bit of warming and a little bit more precipitation.

374
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:23,440
Right. So even here where we are here in Michigan, the projections are that we'll actually have longer growing seasons, right?

375
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:27,300
We'll have enough precipitation water for those crops.

376
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:36,040
So the growing season might start a little bit earlier and it might last a little bit longer from kind of the spring to the fall.

377
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:40,660
So again, the point here is that it's not an across the board all bad.

378
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:49,810
There is potentially some benefits, but it's on a regional scale that these things are changing quite dramatically in time.

379
00:46:49,810 --> 00:46:55,060
This is kind of backing out a little bit on impacts of climate change on human

380
00:46:55,060 --> 00:46:59,960
health and what we're going and focus on a couple of more detailed examples.

381
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:08,650
We're talking about water quality impacts already talking about impacts on food and agriculture.

382
00:47:08,650 --> 00:47:15,220
We referenced we'll talk more in a minute here about extreme heat and about severe weather and about air pollution.

383
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:21,880
Let's see. Yeah. So in terms of extreme heat, this one is actually examples getting a little bit old,

384
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:27,370
but it was one of the first kind of like, Wow, this is a problem, and it's real.

385
00:47:27,370 --> 00:47:38,470
Was this 2003 heat wave that impacts in Europe, and it was the table here that's shown is representing.

386
00:47:38,470 --> 00:47:41,980
Statistics from just the month of August of 2003,

387
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:56,530
so there was this extreme heat event and there were forty four thousand excess deaths in the month of August, simply from extreme heat exposure.

388
00:47:56,530 --> 00:48:04,330
Most impacted was was France at about fifteen thousand out of that 44000.

389
00:48:04,330 --> 00:48:17,850
And you know, the the the biggest impacts and excess deaths from extreme heat events have generally happened in more northern temperate climates.

390
00:48:17,850 --> 00:48:27,920
Right. So even in high income countries, generally speaking, and air conditioning infrastructure wasn't needed for people to stay cool.

391
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:33,370
Right. Because historically the number of like truly hot days was very few out of the year.

392
00:48:33,370 --> 00:48:36,190
Lots of heating infrastructure, but very little.

393
00:48:36,190 --> 00:48:41,770
And especially if you do look at lower income neighborhoods within the U.S. in these northern climates,

394
00:48:41,770 --> 00:48:50,410
you know, public housing, senior centers, you know, these types of of multi-unit living arrangements,

395
00:48:50,410 --> 00:48:56,200
there's not air conditioning in place so that when these extreme heat events happen, there's no way for people to cool.

396
00:48:56,200 --> 00:49:08,590
And again, it's similar to to most other environmental insults. There are some populations that are most vulnerable to the impacts.

397
00:49:08,590 --> 00:49:15,460
So, you know, similarly, we've talked about this a little bit earlier about the urban heat island, right?

398
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:17,320
So this kind of exacerbates the whole thing.

399
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:25,630
We have these impervious surfaces, you know, roadways, rooftops and so forth that raise the temperature even further.

400
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:28,090
And then we have an indirect effect.

401
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:37,690
We have these warmer days, a bigger demand on energy, you know, more fossil fuel combustion to create the energy to actually run the air conditioners.

402
00:49:37,690 --> 00:49:43,930
And we are setting a perfect stage for more photochemical production of urban urban smog.

403
00:49:43,930 --> 00:49:48,550
So in addition to being exposed to extreme heat,

404
00:49:48,550 --> 00:49:59,050
people are also being exposed during those exact same time periods due to high levels of elevated levels of air pollutants.

405
00:49:59,050 --> 00:50:04,000
So moving to storms and specifically hurricanes.

406
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:11,320
So and this one is this one is tough. Four not very well understood reasons.

407
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:17,590
This is a kind of like a weather geek and somebody who's interested in studying this stuff.

408
00:50:17,590 --> 00:50:24,580
It's very frustrating, actually, that we aren't able that we don't understand hurricanes and we aren't able to forecast them better.

409
00:50:24,580 --> 00:50:31,770
Right? I mean, it's like it's 24 hours away from making a landfall and like the error bars are still like, you know, hundreds of miles of coastline.

410
00:50:31,770 --> 00:50:36,100
Really, we aren't able to to model where this is going to go.

411
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:42,520
But anyway, it's no sidebar for reasons not very well understood.

412
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:53,680
In order for a hurricane to form. So for low pressure to develop low enough to make a strong enough storm to produce hurricane force winds,

413
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:58,480
the sea surface temperature needs to be above twenty six degrees Celsius.

414
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:04,720
So if it's at twenty five and a half, we're not going to form a hurricane if it's above twenty six.

415
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:07,090
Now we have the potential to form a hurricane.

416
00:51:07,090 --> 00:51:14,590
So when we talk about global mean surface temperatures right and melting ice caps and redistribution and warming oceans,

417
00:51:14,590 --> 00:51:18,670
it doesn't have to warm by 30 or 40 degrees, right for something bad to happen.

418
00:51:18,670 --> 00:51:21,340
It's just getting us over this threshold.

419
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:31,360
And we're seeing this over recent decades are some pictures from Hurricane Sandy that were affected primarily or

420
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:38,080
in terms of cost the northeast coast of the US either some kind of like before and after picture side by side.

421
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:48,430
So this one here with this bridge and then with it being washed out this one here a tunnel and then completely flooded right and cars piled up.

422
00:51:48,430 --> 00:52:00,650
I think I should remember this stuff. I think Hurricane Sandy was like 70 billion dollars in damages just specific to the northeast part of the US.

423
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:10,360
They're not going, not really looking back in the earlier part of the hurricane and this was in 2013.

424
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:14,380
I believe so we could pull up. The last two years have been awful.

425
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:19,120
They have been the most costly. The highest number of named storms,

426
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:30,850
the highest number of severe hurricanes that have made landfall and impacted the southeast U.S. Louisiana is just like got a giant bull's eye on it.

427
00:52:30,850 --> 00:52:37,750
The last two years have been absolutely awful, but anyway, the point is it's not an anomaly.

428
00:52:37,750 --> 00:52:49,310
It's not like you're looking at. The trend is kind of tough to tell. There are a ton more severe storms from these, these impacts of changing climate.

429
00:52:49,310 --> 00:52:53,260
I'm talking about the cost, but I mean, obviously, we're concerned about deaths, right?

430
00:52:53,260 --> 00:53:01,730
Injuries, disability, people being displaced, you know, livelihoods lost.

431
00:53:01,730 --> 00:53:06,350
Diseases, so coming back to Josh's question from from earlier.

432
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:19,580
But yeah, this is is causing us grief in terms of the incidence of water borne diseases that are affected by hydrologic changes.

433
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:26,900
And actually, I had a I got plotted here from Peru, a data from a paper from some time ago.

434
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:33,650
This is going back to the 1990s looking at a time series of temperature and incidence of childhood diarrhea.

435
00:53:33,650 --> 00:53:38,600
So it's, you know, showing the impact of how climate impacts diarrheal disease.

436
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:46,580
But I want to actually pick up on something local. So whether you're from Michigan or not, you've probably at least heard some some local news.

437
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:59,270
The city of Detroit metropolitan Detroit has a combined sewage and wastewater system, so under normal conditions,

438
00:53:59,270 --> 00:54:05,000
right when someone runs, the faucet goes down a drain and someone flushes the toilet, it goes down a drain.

439
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,900
All those in the same place. When it rains, the water runs off the roadways.

440
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:13,010
And I'll go to the same place. It goes to a water treatment plant.

441
00:54:13,010 --> 00:54:19,670
The water is treated so that hopefully safe water. Now it's discharged into the Detroit river.

442
00:54:19,670 --> 00:54:26,390
All of the solid waste is is burned. That's another issue in terms of air quality.

443
00:54:26,390 --> 00:54:30,320
But this is the infrastructure that's in place.

444
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:40,200
Detroit, like many other areas, has had some really extreme rainfall events over the last just a couple of years with increasing frequency.

445
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:44,240
You know, large scale flooding and what happens?

446
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:54,680
It's pretty common in Michigan that people have basements. They have a drain in their basement and when when the region is inundated with rainfall,

447
00:54:54,680 --> 00:55:03,560
that combined wastewater and runoff system isn't able to manage all the water.

448
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:09,650
So it all, it's backing up into people's homes. And it's not just the rainwater, it's the sewage with it.

449
00:55:09,650 --> 00:55:15,410
So people's homes are flooded not just with rainwater, but with basically toilet water.

450
00:55:15,410 --> 00:55:27,750
And really, you know, very nearby, very relevant, you know, kind of example of how waterborne diseases.

451
00:55:27,750 --> 00:55:31,550
You don't have to go to, you know, to like a low income country or whatever and go through.

452
00:55:31,550 --> 00:55:39,680
These might look like far off exotic examples right here in Michigan, 40 minutes away.

453
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:53,960
This is happening on a routine basis. I'm going to continue along also with these changing climates more rain, less rain, right, flooding drought.

454
00:55:53,960 --> 00:56:00,230
Mosquitoes are possibly like the worst thing on Earth, shaking them.

455
00:56:00,230 --> 00:56:14,870
They are a huge vector in terms of disease transmission, so West Nile virus, chikungunya and dengue.

456
00:56:14,870 --> 00:56:25,430
These are all issues of increasing concern with these regional changes in climate presently and going forward,

457
00:56:25,430 --> 00:56:28,910
air pollution, I promise I was going to come back to that right?

458
00:56:28,910 --> 00:56:36,290
So climate change is resulting on a regional scale in some areas and more stagnation of air masses, right?

459
00:56:36,290 --> 00:56:44,960
So for air pollution, that's bad. We like wind ejecting horizontally to kind of remove pollution out, to create vertical mixing,

460
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:51,860
to allow air pollution to dilute so that we have now even with even with static

461
00:56:51,860 --> 00:56:58,250
emissions of those precursors that form ozone or that form secondary particles.

462
00:56:58,250 --> 00:57:05,390
Just by changing the meteorology, we're able to form more pollution, which is which is very unfortunate.

463
00:57:05,390 --> 00:57:12,620
Combined with that, you know, we mentioned the potential for longer growing seasons, right?

464
00:57:12,620 --> 00:57:20,360
Warmer air, maybe more precipitation, you know, vegetation is happy.

465
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:29,180
That's also able to facilitate increases in allergens that are often in the air.

466
00:57:29,180 --> 00:57:40,400
So you've got, you know, increased heat exposure, increase air pollution in terms of, you know, inorganic anthropogenic pollution.

467
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:52,280
But then also, you know that from trees and pollen, other allergens and exacerbation of, you know, respiratory conditions and so forth.

468
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:58,980
All right, I'm gonna shift into the the policy stuff here. Any questions so far?

469
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:12,180
And I hope I'm not depressing you too much. This is not like a pumped up like smile and be happy type of topic, a little bit of history.

470
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:15,990
Certainly, most people have heard about the Paris climate agreement, right?

471
00:58:15,990 --> 00:58:25,260
This was going back to 2016. If you really keep up on this stuff, you know that there was one just finished a couple weeks ago in Scotland,

472
00:58:25,260 --> 00:58:29,640
which is the most recent annual conference of parties.

473
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:37,320
And these Conference of Parties are an annual event that are in follow up to the original 1992 Rio Convention,

474
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:44,040
which was where the first U.N. framework United Nations framework on climate change was was adopted.

475
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:52,380
It became effective in 1994. There were hundred and ninety five signatory nations to that back in 1992,

476
00:58:52,380 --> 00:58:58,380
and then every year since then, everyone gets together and says, OK, how are we doing?

477
00:58:58,380 --> 00:59:07,230
And what we agreed to? And what else do we need to do, perhaps to address issues that continue to emerge?

478
00:59:07,230 --> 00:59:14,580
And as Sam pointed out earlier, with with better or worse success in achieving that.

479
00:59:14,580 --> 00:59:24,480
But yes, the Paris Climate Paris Climate Agreement is probably the most well known in terms of local cop meetings,

480
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:32,250
you know, because of some, some significant headway that was made during that time period.

481
00:59:32,250 --> 00:59:46,320
Looking at some other related political policy history, the Kyoto Protocol was another that came into play back in 1997,

482
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:54,360
where developed countries and emerging markets agreed to reduce emissions of

483
00:59:54,360 --> 01:00:02,400
six greenhouse gases to five percent below what the word 1990 levels were.

484
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:07,800
And the goal was to achieve this between 2008 and 2012.

485
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:22,680
So by 2007, the Kyoto Protocol and the agreement here had been ratified by all parties in the UN, except the US.

486
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:26,700
Kind of important because not everybody was getting on board.

487
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:39,840
Canada withdrew in 2012, and Russia, Japan and New Zealand basically said they're not interested in setting any new binding commitments.

488
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:53,950
In the end, the outcome was that these original goals of reducing six greenhouse gases between this time period were largely not achieved.

489
01:00:53,950 --> 01:01:00,520
All right. So a little bit of terminology, a little bit of discussion kind of finishing up with.

490
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:03,850
All right, where are we? And you know what's in front of us?

491
01:01:03,850 --> 01:01:07,990
What are the actions to take? So a couple of definitions.

492
01:01:07,990 --> 01:01:17,740
This comes from the IPCC. So when we talk about mitigation strategies, mitigation means an intervention by us,

493
01:01:17,740 --> 01:01:27,700
right by by humans to either reduce the sources of greenhouse gases or enhance the sinks.

494
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:36,850
So as Josh kind of referenced a few minutes ago, renewable options or opportunities of those greenhouse gases.

495
01:01:36,850 --> 01:01:48,280
And then when we talk about climate adaptation, we're talking about an adjustment in our systems, whether they're natural systems or human systems.

496
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:54,040
But in response to what's actually happening or what we expect to happen going forward

497
01:01:54,040 --> 01:02:01,390
with regards to impacts from climate which can either moderate harm or exploit,

498
01:02:01,390 --> 01:02:07,840
you know, beneficial opportunities going forward, various types of adaptation can be distinguished,

499
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:14,920
including those that are anticipatory as well as reactive. They can be private in nature.

500
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:25,300
They can be public in context. They can be autonomous or they can be very well known or in plan conversation.

501
01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:34,990
And then when we use the term climate resilience, this basically means the capability or ability to adapt.

502
01:02:34,990 --> 01:02:39,160
Right. So you can have a lot of good ideas,

503
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:52,090
but this is more of a measure of how practical or evil a community or region a country is and its ability to adapt.

504
01:02:52,090 --> 01:03:02,800
So I'm going to stop talking. I really need your voice in the previous year, and I think probably easiest to just turn to.

505
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:07,240
I don't know whether it's two or three years with ever convenient doesn't have to be an exact number.

506
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:09,850
I'll give you a couple of minutes. Let's let's start a couple of minutes.

507
01:03:09,850 --> 01:03:19,750
First, think of with some examples in terms of public health responses for mitigation strategies related to the climate.

508
01:03:19,750 --> 01:03:25,810
Climate change and its impacts and stressors. We'll kind of break out, report out.

509
01:03:25,810 --> 01:03:35,080
See what folks came up with and then we'll take a couple of minutes to think about examples of adaptation, public health responses.

510
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:40,120
So with that? Go ahead. If you need to move, it's fine. If not, you can get groups of two groups of three.

511
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:47,320
Whatever works for you. Go ahead and talk about opportunities for mitigation for a few minutes.

512
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:58,600
So just thinking about the tree for getting exposure to any of those comments.

513
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:09,140
I mean, so you're reducing the energy efficiency for like insulating homes better and starting to use less.

514
01:04:09,140 --> 01:04:18,050
A lot of people like the like the giant who have 90 degrees or really want to get

515
01:04:18,050 --> 01:04:24,880
crazy with able to talk about like James better and they'll try putting up aerosols,

516
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:28,010
the atmosphere, which is probably not a good idea.

517
01:04:28,010 --> 01:04:42,210
Yeah, maybe a better idea than the earlier mitigation of the world of carbon reducing, which I don't think has been proven to work.

518
01:04:42,210 --> 01:04:48,980
But that's because it's like an expression up the geothermal energy,

519
01:04:48,980 --> 01:04:56,450
whether getting geothermal energy or something like that is like what is in Canada doubling up when you.

520
01:04:56,450 --> 01:05:03,140
You have to do this every day with all the other stuff and that way that kind of traffic in the way that I think we should.

521
01:05:03,140 --> 01:05:15,550
I know another thing and we went where it was limited to the and it's like 30 miles of our entire city going to a few after the end of the department.

522
01:05:15,550 --> 01:05:28,230
Yeah, I don't know what happens. So, yeah, solar panels, just for the company to find some things that are doing at least the right size for itself.

523
01:05:28,230 --> 01:05:37,650
But yeah, that's a good thing. Yeah, yeah, those adaptations feel like moving.

524
01:05:37,650 --> 01:05:41,380
Now what if they were chatting about all spring? Let me give you an idea.

525
01:05:41,380 --> 01:05:45,630
Was actually pretty much everything is really better than this,

526
01:05:45,630 --> 01:05:54,960
where Jesus lives that are really trying to be interesting to do a big that make him or her to prove he's not there.

527
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:57,150
I never wanted to search for detective, for instance,

528
01:05:57,150 --> 01:06:02,820
but it's like you came back the water system I needed for that kind of thing, increasing or dividing.

529
01:06:02,820 --> 01:06:07,030
So are you going to prevent the scorpions on Earth from?

530
01:06:07,030 --> 01:06:13,690
In Detroit, the city is like having a better system where you're not exposed to any terror drought that

531
01:06:13,690 --> 01:06:20,320
would grow better quality part of that structure to make sure the water system encourages,

532
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:31,990
I'm sure, of course, mitigation. You could always talk about, like wealthier countries helping poorer countries develop.

533
01:06:31,990 --> 01:06:36,500
These make small plans to go all solar.

534
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:40,670
May have history on that issue and quite a lot of stuff.

535
01:06:40,670 --> 01:06:54,650
So you think there are huge, huge, huge issue of greenhouse gas emissions?

536
01:06:54,650 --> 01:07:04,220
Adaptation, I guess, would be like kind of adopting like more very controversial diseases like Zika has acted like bridge for very little.

537
01:07:04,220 --> 01:07:10,420
Maybe COVID started taking sandwich precautions that people or people are like in Central America?

538
01:07:10,420 --> 01:07:21,030
Are it like mosquito nets or do you like from.

539
01:07:21,030 --> 01:07:26,610
You know. All right.

540
01:07:26,610 --> 01:07:41,490
What did what did folks come up with first? Sorry to interrupt for some examples of mitigation strategies or responses.

541
01:07:41,490 --> 01:07:45,420
I'm hoping you came up with something or in big trouble, yeah.

542
01:07:45,420 --> 01:07:54,120
Anything that reduces ambition or energy use decreases the carbon that you're putting in the atmosphere or.

543
01:07:54,120 --> 01:07:57,550
Uses more renewable. Excellent.

544
01:07:57,550 --> 01:08:04,690
So what would be I mean for everybody, what would be some, some specific examples of that of those incursion, like energy efficiency?

545
01:08:04,690 --> 01:08:09,910
So we have to use less to get the same outcome. OK, so energy efficient,

546
01:08:09,910 --> 01:08:16,660
maybe the products themselves or the use of the products could both achieve sales also sometimes increase consumption of energy,

547
01:08:16,660 --> 01:08:27,280
too, which is a right right. We're talking about reducing output at all rather than maximizing efficiency, just reducing output.

548
01:08:27,280 --> 01:08:28,810
We're talking about driving cars.

549
01:08:28,810 --> 01:08:38,050
You got like a phase or speed limits in a certain area, so you don't waste that plays into the efficiency alternative, right?

550
01:08:38,050 --> 01:08:43,330
Public transportation versus personal vehicles? Absolutely.

551
01:08:43,330 --> 01:08:52,150
Any others the science of backing back out to just overall mitigation examples of mitigation responses,

552
01:08:52,150 --> 01:08:56,290
planting trees and improving like ecosystem services offered carpet.

553
01:08:56,290 --> 01:09:01,540
OK, so this is now moving to the more specifically the CINCs component, right?

554
01:09:01,540 --> 01:09:14,230
Yeah. So so trees, right vegetation. We inhale oxygen right and give our CO2 plants do the reverse right.

555
01:09:14,230 --> 01:09:28,060
So they are actually a sink for CO2. There's also aspects of four for for coastal areas,

556
01:09:28,060 --> 01:09:35,110
and the concern about flooding is the different types of vegetation take up water through their root systems.

557
01:09:35,110 --> 01:09:43,690
From what I understand quite differently, I know that like South Florida is probably like the whatever the poster for the at in the US,

558
01:09:43,690 --> 01:09:48,760
for her kind of urban coastal flooding on a regular basis.

559
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:51,070
And I know there are big initiatives down there, too.

560
01:09:51,070 --> 01:10:00,370
You know, everybody likes the pretty palm trees, but they're apparently like terrible in terms of providing any benefit with with water uptake,

561
01:10:00,370 --> 01:10:05,500
but also just support for for shade or cooling right in an urban landscape.

562
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:08,620
And so these big initiatives to kind of replace like over time,

563
01:10:08,620 --> 01:10:16,660
a huge percentage of those palm trees with other trees that I don't really know the details of, but that are better in both regards.

564
01:10:16,660 --> 01:10:22,750
Yeah, yeah. Along those lines and it is more adaptation, but like for a hurricane impacts as well,

565
01:10:22,750 --> 01:10:27,460
you know, mangroves or certain types of vegetation really shelter?

566
01:10:27,460 --> 01:10:33,280
Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. So good examples of specific to more extreme weather with like with hurricanes.

567
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:38,680
Absolutely. What else for mitigation?

568
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:45,110
I don't talk about the type. Something I heard that was really.

569
01:10:45,110 --> 01:10:52,680
And you'd be kind of far fetched, but great scientists that are doing the debate and the.

570
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:58,440
And trying to bring back our health and social environment and then reintroduce it into

571
01:10:58,440 --> 01:11:04,050
the environment because they said that it's like all this something around is going to.

572
01:11:04,050 --> 01:11:14,490
The soil is going to keep my hair cold, and it's really a lot of weight, but very cool.

573
01:11:14,490 --> 01:11:21,900
Yeah, yeah, I think the guy constantly floods the theme park or something there.

574
01:11:21,900 --> 01:11:32,710
That's awesome. Everybody gets a little bit about like potential future technology for taking carbon out of the air or like,

575
01:11:32,710 --> 01:11:39,780
I think there are some suggestions for some kind of particles into the atmosphere to reduce the amount of sunlight.

576
01:11:39,780 --> 01:11:44,730
Sure. Yes. Talk about how those things themselves could have some impact.

577
01:11:44,730 --> 01:11:53,790
Yeah, yeah, absolutely. And so, you know, that's actually the kind of the focus of some of our our debate topics that we're going to talk about.

578
01:11:53,790 --> 01:12:04,200
But uh, with our with our hierarchy of controls, right and eliminating or substituting it that applies here, right?

579
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:08,700
We might come up with what we think is a better idea to help solve something else,

580
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:14,450
but we better stay a couple of steps ahead of what the impacts of that of that strategy might be as well.

581
01:12:14,450 --> 01:12:31,690
Let's I'm sensitive of the time. Let's go ahead and switch and chat for a couple of minutes about examples of adaptation responses.

582
01:12:31,690 --> 01:12:39,490
So he's creating a drought resistant crops like genetic of sorry, Josh, I'll give you guys like maybe two or three minutes,

583
01:12:39,490 --> 01:12:44,050
go ahead and pair or three or four or whatever you want, and then we'll I'll save a couple of minutes.

584
01:12:44,050 --> 01:12:55,210
Are you going to pull it back up? Sorry about that. I thought we had maybe five people trying to have better, better ways to deal with them.

585
01:12:55,210 --> 01:13:03,700
And even if they were just creating greater barriers for infectious disease,

586
01:13:03,700 --> 01:13:10,050
then there's a lack of a better way to paint buildings in cities like this,

587
01:13:10,050 --> 01:13:22,970
like white mountain duplex, where somebody like this is kind of like, Yeah, that would be the right.

588
01:13:22,970 --> 01:13:27,290
Early green roofs, the ability to access water.

589
01:13:27,290 --> 01:13:46,820
Well, I agree with the green. Eighteen have better not even drawn by previous I would like people to take as much water, even as much water and.

590
01:13:46,820 --> 01:13:54,020
Or even just have better, very fast direction for the reservoir is formulated quite now.

591
01:13:54,020 --> 01:14:02,330
So that's why I love them are leaving unless they don't have any time to go.

592
01:14:02,330 --> 01:14:08,200
Adding or sharing their cooling systems and also green space communications is a big one.

593
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:37,800
Yeah, absolutely. Especially during.

594
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:49,680
Interesting, what is the British scientist reported that the idea of activating the volcano when you I had I was playing with that idea the other day,

595
01:14:49,680 --> 01:14:55,140
I'm like, What if you had like or something must be around to like some kind of changes?

596
01:14:55,140 --> 01:14:59,970
And one of my classes tomorrow, we're going to remember it like there's a figure of a limited nuclear exchange

597
01:14:59,970 --> 01:15:05,040
would produce like like they're like nuclear but difficult to produce two Celsius.

598
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:18,310
Yeah, because sort of the hazard and that's at the same volcano idea of like the aerosol yeah, becomes like the same like limiting the Bill Gates.

599
01:15:18,310 --> 01:15:22,290
He's really advocating for the idea of injecting like that.

600
01:15:22,290 --> 01:15:28,290
It's like, Oh my gosh, it's awesome. It's terrifying. I don't think it would turn this guy.

601
01:15:28,290 --> 01:15:31,710
All right. Let's put it like this. Sorry to interrupt.

602
01:15:31,710 --> 01:15:36,300
Let's go ahead and reconvene and report out. So what? What ideas did folks come up with?

603
01:15:36,300 --> 01:15:48,150
Examples of adaptation for climate responses? I know you've got one jury started with one.

604
01:15:48,150 --> 01:15:56,360
Yes, you could genetically engineered crops for different characteristics to adapt to the different growth versions, depending on where you are.

605
01:15:56,360 --> 01:16:06,390
OK, so genetic engineering? What else I think you do like some geoengineering like I have that I don't know what it is.

606
01:16:06,390 --> 01:16:10,580
They think that they want to inject an atmosphere to like reflected more.

607
01:16:10,580 --> 01:16:18,650
This is Rebecca was speaking of. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That would be a very easy adaptation, but you've no idea what.

608
01:16:18,650 --> 01:16:26,390
Yeah, sure. Everything said more resilient infrastructure like buildings and stuff,

609
01:16:26,390 --> 01:16:32,690
especially in coastal areas that are more resistant to flooding and won't be damaged in half two year period every time.

610
01:16:32,690 --> 01:16:40,140
Absolutely, absolutely. So more resilient infrastructure for sure in California.

611
01:16:40,140 --> 01:16:46,540
And I think the issue to me is like birds of going to want to stomp down like hills.

612
01:16:46,540 --> 01:16:56,570
So don't try to force the wildfires will be intense. OK, so as a way to add depth to effects from from wildfires?

613
01:16:56,570 --> 01:17:05,310
Absolutely. And Rebecca, in extreme heat waves, just like air conditioning in the North West this summer.

614
01:17:05,310 --> 01:17:12,350
A lot of the health effects are because people don't have the air conditioning, they're really cooling centers and public places.

615
01:17:12,350 --> 01:17:19,380
Right? So opportunity. So in response building and kind of an infrastructure for how to stay cool and extreme heat events?

616
01:17:19,380 --> 01:17:22,950
Absolutely. All right. That's great. Thank you so much.

617
01:17:22,950 --> 01:17:30,240
I think I have one slide left, which is kind of just to bring us all back around, and it's a complicated framework.

618
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:36,690
We won't go through it all, but you know, all the science and then bringing in mitigation and adaptation frameworks.

619
01:17:36,690 --> 01:17:43,080
And you know, the takeaway message is this important is that it's not an either or argument, right?

620
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:48,960
We're not trying to decide to the focus, be on mitigation or should the focus be on adaptation,

621
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:52,650
the focus needs to be on both because both are facing us.

622
01:17:52,650 --> 01:17:55,380
We need to strive for mitigation strategies.

623
01:17:55,380 --> 01:18:05,640
But we're we're kind of already past the point of no return in terms of we're going to need to also adapt to climate changes coming forward.

624
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:11,520
So we are right at the end of the class period, folks that have any other questions, I'll go ahead and wrap up.

625
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:16,710
Have a good rest of your day and I'll see you on Thursday. I'll hang up here for another minute.

626
01:18:16,710 --> 01:18:21,870
Folks have any questions. You know, it's like the aerosol injection.

627
01:18:21,870 --> 01:18:30,240
I'm like, it's kind of a separate schools. Cloud seeding potentially cause drought and what the weather pattern.

628
01:18:30,240 --> 01:18:35,448
But I mean it while am daily and we're like, I like.
