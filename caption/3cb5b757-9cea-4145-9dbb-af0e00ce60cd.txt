1
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:32,620
She also. Papers concerning her.

2
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:47,880
I actually saw her completeness.

3
00:00:50,810 --> 00:01:03,280
Oh. This sentiment has been.

4
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:55,440
Okay. Well. Okay, guys.

5
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:58,829
So I just updated our little course evaluation numbers.

6
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:03,780
So if you have a chance, go ahead and complete those if you haven't already.

7
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:09,629
Welcome to our last day of class. Try to end on positive notes.

8
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:16,170
Talk about positive youth development and some programs that have happened here at U of M and in Beijing.

9
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:20,730
And yeah, just confirming.

10
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:27,690
I know I have received some papers from people already, so thank you. I've been able to sort of start start doing some looking at those.

11
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:39,600
And so the rest I know are coming Monday. And so I will be getting feedback to you guys shortly thereafter how it goes.

12
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,040
So I hope everybody's hanging in there with everything I have to do.

13
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:52,770
I know it's just everybody's at max peak peak stuff today or this week.

14
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:57,420
Um, okay, so today we want to talk about positive youth development.

15
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:03,209
I gave some readings. I like the one with the G.

16
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:08,910
Brooks and one about kind of components of youth development programs.

17
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:14,010
So I would say, for those of you who want to kind of go out and be in this space,

18
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:19,200
this is a handy paper to kind of hang on to just because it it's almost like a cookbook.

19
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:23,129
These are good components to put into your youth development program.

20
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:27,660
If you're working with one or want to approve it or create your own or whatever you guys want to do.

21
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:35,130
So that's that's good resource. Oh, and then the other thing I wanted to say is that you guys may know better than I,

22
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:42,420
but like your canvas, access to all the class materials does end after class at some point.

23
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:45,510
And so if people have want to like download stuff,

24
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:51,389
what I have suggested people do in the past and seems to have been helpful for folks is to like make just a

25
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:57,510
Google folder or something and dump readings in if there's like particular meetings that you're interested in.

26
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:04,200
And if people are like, you know, in two years like, oh my gosh, I need more like just email me because I have access.

27
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:09,059
But I know that, you know, certain topics like people like to do deep dives into.

28
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:17,470
So I just, I tend to just keep like a running list of all of those, you know, additional readings for people who are interested.

29
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:24,210
So but I did want to note that so like after finals, if you're like one on the couch, you just download a bunch of them.

30
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:34,079
Like that's a good thing to do. So I think that's kind of what I want to say about the sort of end of class stuff.

31
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:41,040
So, okay, so moving on to positive development, we know this like we've talked about this a lot, right?

32
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:50,310
Especially in adolescence, which is where a lot of these positive youth development programs kind of tend to happen in middle school and later.

33
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,399
So how can we prevent these risks?

34
00:04:53,400 --> 00:05:00,479
And I think the other thing is that, again, hopefully has come forth in this classes of being that like being sort of problem free is not enough.

35
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:04,260
And we want to talk about resilience, driving, positive development.

36
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:14,070
So here are some just examples of healthy behaviors that we can focus on in, you know, youth, adolescents, middle schoolers,

37
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:26,550
adults eating right, getting exercise or moving, getting sleep, avoiding injury and substance use and engage in responsible sexual behavior.

38
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:33,299
And then these are sort of these like psychological characteristics that are really particularly critical for youth.

39
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:38,910
And as, again, with so many things we've discussed in this class, like these are, I think,

40
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:45,360
like very under threat in the COVID and whatever post COVID era we're in right now.

41
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:55,590
This is just really these are so important for that teen emerging adulthood time and yet I think we

42
00:05:55,590 --> 00:06:03,809
have really we're living in a space where these are really like at risk for not developing optimally.

43
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:06,840
So it's important to keep those in mind.

44
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:14,820
And when we're talking about positive youth development, we want to think about increasing protective factors and decreasing risk factors.

45
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:25,680
And then this again, kind of like that article is thinking of thinking through if we're thinking about developing positive youth development programs,

46
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,180
working in those programs, directing those programs, deciding whether to fund those programs,

47
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:37,650
and how like these are elements of the setting that are important to kind of think through.

48
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,620
And so, again, thinking also about the prevention papers,

49
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:46,979
when I asked you guys to talk about like logistics and what the implementation would look like in your setting of choice,

50
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:53,670
these are kind of things to think about. So in any given health promotion setting, what's the.

51
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:58,020
Developmental sort of appropriate space you could create.

52
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:02,110
Like, remember we talked about that room with the early on and early intervention stuff

53
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:05,639
with like the corner table with corners on it and like colors on the walls.

54
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:11,730
So like if you think about a youth development setting, those are sort of elements to think about.

55
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:18,809
We want to make sure that settings are structured, safe, and I would argue relationship focused.

56
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:23,040
And so we talked so much about early childhood in those early developmental relationships.

57
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:29,910
As we're talking about teens and youth, we often think about mentoring, mentoring, type relationships.

58
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:35,160
So that was another one of the readings, how to create those so that they're helpful and sustainable,

59
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:41,790
I think is a good question and it often doesn't happen and some mentoring programs and it's hard to maintain.

60
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:48,270
The other idea here with Youth again is that promotion of healthy norms.

61
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:55,799
So like you want to get youth together in a positive way, promote healthy norms, positive social norms,

62
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:03,629
as opposed to those AstraZeneca effects that we talked about the other day and then the other things that are really important for youth.

63
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:11,100
And again, this kind of sense fits in here, but the idea of self efficacy and mastery like teaching skills and having youth actually

64
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:16,530
learn something that's applicable in their life is really critically important.

65
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:20,879
And so that can obviously vary wildly.

66
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,780
Lots of different topics.

67
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:33,929
I was just joking about like how I don't do cooking well like that's a, that's a good life skill to acquire as, as a young person, as an example.

68
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:37,860
So you can think of lots of different examples, but these are kind of, I think,

69
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:41,880
cross over elements of settings that are, that are important to consider.

70
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:46,500
The other thing that I think is important to know about,

71
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:53,250
and I don't know if people have heard of the positive developmental assets framework, does that familiar to anybody?

72
00:08:55,290 --> 00:09:01,859
Well, good or maybe not good because it's like lived in the research world.

73
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:04,679
But anyway, it's actually been around for a while.

74
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:11,910
And you know, I like end date on sort of positive youth development because we talk so much about this,

75
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:19,829
you know, these youth are at risk is youth are at risk. And although that is sort of true from a like epidemiological perspective,

76
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:26,900
like I think having a lens on prevention and positive development relationships and this

77
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:33,270
developmental assets framework is all about what can we think of as assets that we can build.

78
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:42,240
And so kind of similar to, you know, it's like the flipside of the ACES framework, these cluster in different areas.

79
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:48,719
So talk about support, empowerment, boundaries and expectations that sort of that healthy norms thing.

80
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:55,230
So like avoiding iatrogenic effects but also promoting positive norms, constructive use of time.

81
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:59,430
So this is where like a lot of after school program interventions come in.

82
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:07,169
So thinking about how can we, you know, reach youth in spaces where they are and where they sort of have downtime.

83
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:14,190
So like everything from kind of homework clubs to like exercise after school, Girls on the Run is an example of something like this.

84
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:22,500
So those are all sort of like setting factors or external, like things we can set up for youth that are positive.

85
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:31,530
And then these internal assets, which are more sort of individual difference factors, so things like youth being committed to learning,

86
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:37,109
having positive values, social competence and positive identity sort of out themselves.

87
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:47,309
So these sort of self developmental assets and also external and developmental assets that we can we can develop this.

88
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:50,490
The Search Institute is kind of a good one to know about.

89
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:54,240
Again, if people are in that sort of adolescent, adolescent youth space,

90
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:59,760
there are these they I think there are 40 developmental assets that they talk about.

91
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,940
There are measures that they provide on that site.

92
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:10,139
And so they have, you know, tools where you can assess like how are the developmental assets in this community of kids?

93
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:15,690
What do they look like? Emily, did you have that question?

94
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:28,740
Yeah. So I think this is a good one to know about because they do do these little reports that sort of, you know, you can be working with a school,

95
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:35,400
for example, and you can say, oh, I want to map to developmental asset mapping of the school that I'm working in.

96
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:41,220
So the Search Institute is a good one to know about for tools and resources in that space.

97
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:49,890
What they do, you know, this is just like one example of the little report that they came up that they had.

98
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:54,590
This is grades four through 12. So again, it's the sort of older kid. Space.

99
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:59,540
And what they find here for this age is like kids are reporting more developmental

100
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:04,940
assets in their family setting compared to like school or community.

101
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:17,450
And so this kind of research has been going on for the past few decades and really pointing towards community as a space where like,

102
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:25,610
gosh, we could do more to support our youth. And I would argue that we urgently need to do more in that space to support our youth,

103
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:32,900
because really are youth struggling big time in terms of what we've talked about, mental health and other things.

104
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:41,480
And so, again, this is a really important gap, and there are examples of programs that sort of seek to fill this gap.

105
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:46,220
But I would say, like, if you're if you're interested in youth and adolescence,

106
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:51,920
like this is a really powerful place to be and to be thinking about interventions.

107
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:57,440
And that can be lots of different communities could be like hospital focused, school focused,

108
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:03,320
public health, you know, health department focused, community organizations, etc.

109
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:12,860
So it's very flexible. But community kind of making communities engage youth and be better for youth,

110
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:18,290
I think is like a great overarching goal for people who are interested in these kind of these older kids.

111
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:30,980
Okay. And then, of course, this is partly why we have talked a lot about all of these things.

112
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:36,850
I think I think we've mentioned at least every single one of these words in this class.

113
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:44,950
And some of these words, but probably less.

114
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,260
Like, I don't know if I've said social capital,

115
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:58,330
but I think it's just so critical to like pause on that space because we do we're like spending increasing time up here, which is good.

116
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:04,330
I think that's important and we want to be aware of that. And everybody, you know, like finishing this class should be very aware of these things.

117
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:08,890
But I think also grounding it in this idea of community and of course,

118
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:16,300
why we're doing that at this developmental stage is that like kids are moving out more into that community than their younger, younger selves were.

119
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:24,400
So this is a good model they talk about. This is Wendy Ellis, the person who developed this, and that's this like pair of aces idea.

120
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,920
So again, I don't know if this is familiar to people,

121
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:36,939
but Aces has obviously really taken off and this sort of way of thinking about grounding it in the community is a tree is

122
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:43,280
often used with that like roots and wings metaphor and 0 to 5 years in the tree and a lot of tree metaphors going out.

123
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:49,420
I like this one because it sort of spells out a little bit parts of the community that we could think about.

124
00:14:51,060 --> 00:15:00,010
It makes a lot of sense. So I just, you know, there are some work that's there's some work,

125
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:05,620
some intervention work actually that's starting to kind of use this model really explicitly.

126
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:17,770
So I got interested. Good to know about. And the other thing that I'll just kind of go through is that so I'm talking a lot about community.

127
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:25,750
These are examples. It's an example of community improvement projects actually for my hometown, which is kind of fun.

128
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:33,910
But we also have obviously talked a lot about family factors and here kind of a review as well as individual child factors.

129
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:36,790
Right. And so we're thinking about positive youth development.

130
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:42,610
One of the common ways to think about it is that if we go in through the sort of community space,

131
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,989
then we end up having impact on these other factors too.

132
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:50,620
So we can think about like, you know, the social ecological model.

133
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:55,149
It's like work on the child and make them better work on the parent child relationship, make that better.

134
00:15:55,150 --> 00:16:02,170
You know, let's look, we've spent a lot of time in those spaces, but this is kind of coming down a little bit more, you know,

135
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:12,760
mid to top down from the community side and saying if kids can engage here, it will actually improve this whole process.

136
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:19,760
And again, it makes sense then that it's for older kids. Okay.

137
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:25,040
So how do we go about doing this and like building these assets?

138
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:30,110
So there's one. I'll just pop all these up here. The, you know, this.

139
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:38,449
So there's a bunch of social development researchers at the University of Washington that have sort of like,

140
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:43,399
on the one hand, social development strategies, like the most generic name you can possibly think of.

141
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:52,250
But it's sort of this process. So if you're providing opportunities for youth to become engaged in their community in very specific ways,

142
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,960
and I'll talk about this program here you have them.

143
00:16:55,700 --> 00:17:02,030
You want to also focus on, you know, building the skills that the youth need to be successful in that setting.

144
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:05,930
Right. So if you're talking about, you know, doing a building project,

145
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:12,230
you have to make sure that you're providing opportunities for youth to learn building skills.

146
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:15,770
And for that, you often need mentors from the community.

147
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:24,890
So this is this very concrete way to think about like, well, how do we get youth community involved?

148
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:33,650
Another key point here in terms of this process is providing recognition for effort and achievement and building a social group.

149
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:44,660
And this is back to those healthy, healthy, pro-social norms that hopefully will be developed through these shared activities.

150
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:51,379
And what I would say is that there is actually a lot of research behind this.

151
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:59,540
And again, these for those of you who've been involved in youth programs, I don't know if this sort of sequence makes sense,

152
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:05,149
but these are I would say like these hopefully underpin a lot of successful youth

153
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:11,590
programs and there's certainly a lot of research to show that they've been,

154
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:17,270
do you know, have impact on those youth health risks that we want to reduce?

155
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:28,190
Okay. So I could there's this video and make sure this video that.

156
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:37,610
Yeah. Let me see what you guys think. This video. We move to YouTube.

157
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:51,650
So I was messing around with my slides. So, okay, so here I'm going to show you dozens video of this community in Denver, outside of Denver,

158
00:18:53,060 --> 00:19:01,970
not accrues, but basically what they're trying to do is like figure out a way to implement this sequence.

159
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:13,640
And what I want you guys to think about is the steps they're taking and where you might consider based on what they're talking about.

160
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:16,860
Like think about interventions. What kind of interventions?

161
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:21,020
I'll just play the cruise ad for a minute. We not think about going on vacation.

162
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:26,570
Oh, my gosh. There's another one. Okay, now I got to get there. We'll get more done.

163
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:30,020
And they quickly can share with you.

164
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:33,380
Okay. That was like a lot of ads.

165
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:38,860
Okay. Feel like it's blasting. All right. I shouldn't be lifting.

166
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:49,100
Oh, good observation. I like that.

167
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:55,650
We haven't really talked about that stuff in here, but I love that feedback.

168
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:05,900
Yeah, the body image. Okay, so these guys are going to talk about this project.

169
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:09,560
It's called The Communities the Care. It's based on that social development strategy model.

170
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,970
And just, you know,

171
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:19,610
think about the kinds of things they're doing and what what it would make you think about in terms of what we might implement in this community.

172
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:24,030
Okay. So I'll probably stop you guys.

173
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:40,080
Why not start? Just start there. Montebello is a neighborhood in Denver's far northeast area.

174
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:44,460
It is removed geographically from the hub of Denver,

175
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:53,160
which is important because while Denver is a thriving and booming city, Montebello has historically been underserved.

176
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:59,160
It has not received the same number of services that other Denver neighborhoods are perceived.

177
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:03,719
When we look through the lens of data and looking at Montebello,

178
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:11,490
one of the things we see is is high higher levels of kind of simple assaults, not necessarily always violent assaults, but simple assaults.

179
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:19,110
We also have in this community our share of violent types of issues that have come out because of gangs.

180
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:27,570
We have a lot of children who are here, a higher rate of children under the age of 18 in this particular community, in other communities.

181
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:32,670
If you ask any young person at my table, they'll be able to tell you where to,

182
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:37,410
where they can go to, to buy drugs, where they can go to have access to certain things.

183
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:42,180
I think the Montebello Park and Ride is notorious for drug sales.

184
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:46,720
It's kind of a hub that many of the normal residents go through.

185
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:50,250
We have a bridge. Okay. So just pausing there.

186
00:21:53,320 --> 00:22:01,240
What does it make you? What does it make you consider, like the type of data they collected, what they noticed from their data, their process?

187
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:09,469
Based on your general knowledge of child and family and community functioning.

188
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:16,650
And the stuff I was just talking about and just thinking about the data they collected is interesting.

189
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:25,879
Just asking you like even if maybe they aren't purchasing drugs where they would get them and generally they know where that is,

190
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:32,180
which isn't surprising, but. Yeah. You. Just like the quality you asked me was like, where would you get it?

191
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:41,749
Yeah. So they, they've engaged you for years. They are asking about the risk side, which makes sense.

192
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:44,870
Like that's what we're sort of paid to eliminate this risk.

193
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:48,979
So you need to know that. But yeah, that was going to be mine.

194
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:53,750
They didn't really focus on the assets of the community, not I mean I saw some parts of like, you know.

195
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:59,360
Mm. You talk about those and other things that they can ask that could answer in general.

196
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:04,910
Yeah. Yeah. So they didn't really get into the asset side for sure.

197
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:12,200
Which is interesting because a lot of this research that's done both like done risk community risks and assets.

198
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:24,110
So if you guys were like just at this point thinking of intervention in this community, like where where might you consider focusing?

199
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,820
Or what type of intervention.

200
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:36,720
Like what Caroline said, like maybe youth who are using the like know how like engaging them in like what looks like a protective factor.

201
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:38,799
Like why? Even though they know where they can get them,

202
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:46,000
why are they able to figure out like how you can implement like the things that they have in their life to you for maybe engage in interviews?

203
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:55,630
Mm hmm. Right. So if you guys know the term positive deviance, the idea that, like, you know, it's kind of like a protection or resilience factor.

204
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:03,069
So you may know all about like the bus station or the bus, you know, the bus shelter there, but you're not doing that.

205
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:11,490
So what is it about you, your situation, your community, your ties, something that is having you not engage in that in those behaviors, so.

206
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:17,049
Absolutely. Yeah. And also makes me think about some, like, place based interventions, you know,

207
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:24,430
that idea of like I like how she said she's a little bit like loosey goosey with the turquoise earrings.

208
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:31,900
But she's she's like when we we looked at the data like she just has this like, love of data signs through.

209
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:37,419
But she also talked about two different kinds or three different kinds of like violence indicators.

210
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:43,810
Right. And so it's important to be precise like that, if you can, to think about what you might do.

211
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:49,510
And if you have place based interventions, it's like, well, let's get somebody to the bus stop and see what's happening.

212
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:55,180
But then if you go to the bus stop, you're going to maybe push, you know, activities out to other areas.

213
00:24:55,180 --> 00:25:00,190
So then you want to also monitor those other areas and what's happening with that kind of police based type of work.

214
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:08,830
Okay, so let's keep going. Transient neighborhood. So there's not a lot of emotional attachment and we have a lot of single parent families.

215
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:17,170
It's low income. The school across the street from the Boys and Girls Home has a 98% free or reduced lunch rate.

216
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:24,340
Right now. It's undergoing a significant educational turnaround effort targeting elementary, middle and high schools in the area.

217
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:33,759
This began about two years ago. So a few things you just ticked off like tons of like those standard risk factors.

218
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,790
And I hear about all the time in the literature and you're like, okay,

219
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:42,430
this and it sounds like there's maybe a transition and it's kind of educational space that they could maximize.

220
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:55,950
There's the data. The data committee or the Risk of Protective Factor Committee really did an excellent job of spending hours

221
00:25:56,100 --> 00:26:02,220
combing through the data that came from both our small climate survey as well as our community survey.

222
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:09,420
The risk factors that they identified as priority were early and persistent problem behavior,

223
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:18,570
family management and family conflict, as well as teens having friends that were engaging in problem behavior.

224
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:25,499
The data that we received through their communities that care interview process in the community with all kinds of stakeholders,

225
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:30,659
which was wonderful to have that rich data showing us on things and on the risk factor

226
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:35,160
areas that showed as areas around family conflict and family management issues,

227
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:46,110
early onset of issues and that kind of peer engagement, both those of older adolescent peer influences, types of that issues over time.

228
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:51,600
Okay, so what's another thing that just came up with our second deep review of data by the data committee?

229
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:57,970
Another possible area of focus. Yeah.

230
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:06,280
They talked about like just influences from peers but also from like older role models, I guess.

231
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:13,630
And it made me think of, I guess looking back, I guess it was kind of an intervention that we had in, in high school called example.

232
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:23,170
And we got um, once a month, every Saturday our English teacher hosted it, bring in speakers playing fun games, tournaments, competitions,

233
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:30,880
and you come in the goal or like the message was that you can have a that high school experience without using alcohol or drugs.

234
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:38,770
Mm hmm. Um, and it was focused mainly on alcohol and opioids and stuff, because a lot of us were like athletes getting injured and things.

235
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:48,909
But if you take one senior girl and one senior boy every meeting to speak and kind of give their experience throughout high school,

236
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:51,549
that's kind of what I'm thinking could be done here.

237
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:58,660
Have some sort of group where older and younger kids are brought together and kind of not like necessarily mentor because

238
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:03,999
ours wasn't really long term and I think it might be hard to implement something long term in this type of a setting.

239
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:14,079
But just to show like here's a model behavior of someone who's older, who does not or never did engage in these type of behaviors.

240
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:17,590
And it's possible for you to. Hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. That's interesting.

241
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:22,710
And I think that that term mentor, it is like a heavy it implies a lot, right?

242
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:28,659
Implies a lot. And I think in that article, it kind of came up like these guys are much more than mentors and like they built all these relationships.

243
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:33,729
But could something that's that would take a lot of organization but it's a lighter touch kind

244
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:39,250
of intervention than a mentoring program that you need to really keep the relationships going.

245
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:45,070
But like example, peer example compared to peer mentor is like a different level of intensity.

246
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:50,889
Great, great example. Yeah. So yeah, kind of building on that better.

247
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:59,470
That sounds like sharing like positive experiences rather than like fear based like this is what happened to me and I think that is it.

248
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:03,490
As if I maybe for something stupid like scared straight or whatever.

249
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:13,190
And I don't know, I feel like it's better to instill, like, positive experiences and make it more, like, encouraging and like that.

250
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:24,459
That's possible. Like the scary, like slippery slope narratives when you're already is like or has tried drugs or alcohol and they might feel like,

251
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:28,270
Oh, I'm already like a lost cause, right?

252
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:30,729
Like either I'm a lost cause or like, I tried this.

253
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:39,850
I'm doing okay so far, like, you know, and remember their that was that much more like fear based exposure, you know, scared straight.

254
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:42,850
And we know it didn't work and it did get evaluated that it didn't work.

255
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:47,830
So yeah, sort of having more of a positive role modeling that can provide more of a roadmap.

256
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:53,740
So like especially from kids in your community who are making these positive choices, right?

257
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:55,360
That's that like positive, healthy norms.

258
00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:04,540
I mean, it sounds very like either like simple or kind of Pollyanna ish, but I think it is important to think about it developmentally,

259
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:08,049
like, okay, kids are trying to figure out like who they want to be, what's their identity.

260
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:13,030
So like, can we, you know, give them like a close identity that is positive one.

261
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:24,309
So I think the other thing that came up too was the like that early start, early behavior problem stuff and family conflict management stuff.

262
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:31,620
So that also points to like that that younger age group maybe providing some like parenting supports that they found data.

263
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:35,260
So it's like these sort of two elements that they're that they're considering.

264
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:45,100
I'm I hope that the communities that care process really brings more people to the table, enriches the community of Montebello,

265
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:51,310
helps to empower them to take even more ownership of the things that happened to Montebello.

266
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:59,470
And in Montebello. I think the communities that care process, because it requires so many people to come to the table,

267
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:08,620
really fosters this ongoing relationship with different aspects of the community that otherwise would not be enjoyed.

268
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:15,190
And so what I hope to see is that grow and build so that when that when change needs to happen,

269
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:18,970
it's not about building an infrastructure and then trying to solve problems,

270
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:22,230
but there's already a network of people that are available to do something.

271
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:34,899
I like that. And so I think the other point there is really just sort of investing in those community networks, right?

272
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,910
So that when she she said, you know,

273
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:44,500
before something happens and you kind of have the networks that are built and the idea of doing community surveys,

274
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:48,760
which I don't know if people have had experience with, but that's certainly something we think about a lot.

275
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:53,770
And you know, each bag kind of approaches and thinking about like engage with communities,

276
00:31:53,890 --> 00:32:01,900
collect data from communities and think about the kind of data you're collecting and then go back to communities and check in and say like,

277
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:04,510
now that we know this, what do you guys think?

278
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:09,069
Where are your strengths and assets in your community that we can bring to bear on these kind of issues?

279
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:19,110
So it's interesting that, again, that that video is filled.

280
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:24,429
It's got a little bit of like a like a Pollyanna vibe to it.

281
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:26,500
But I like that they sort of describe the process.

282
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:37,490
So just to kind of link a little bit to the reading so that Gina Burks on paper is all about just what makes for effective programs.

283
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:42,160
So it's kind of like a cookbook of these are important elements to consider in youth focused programs.

284
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:51,999
This one is I like to to parent because it's really trying to identify like, who are these youth mentors?

285
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,930
Who are they? What should they be like, what they should be? Should they be prepared to do?

286
00:32:56,860 --> 00:33:02,379
Because those of us who've tried to, you know, who've worked with youth in that sort of leadership role,

287
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:08,950
like maybe the people who came to the groups Carly was talking about or, you know, some other spokesperson who could be a youth mentor.

288
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:12,400
That's like not an easy person to find necessarily.

289
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:16,660
And so it's a great model, but you have to find the right people.

290
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:20,350
So there are, I think, increasing,

291
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:26,020
which I think is positive groups in like high schools that are talking about mental health awareness and that kind of thing.

292
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:33,280
And so that's a place that's an example of one of these type of programs and then the mentoring piece.

293
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:37,270
Any thoughts on that on that question?

294
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:47,230
I guess in terms of like what are key ingredients for either youth mentors or, you know, adults who are youth mentors or youth who are peer mentors,

295
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:57,170
that people have had experience or thoughts about, you know, what qualities make for a good mentor mentee ideas.

296
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:03,420
It's it can be really hard to find. Yeah.

297
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:10,170
How do you go back to someone who is empathetic and relatable?

298
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:19,060
But also, if you can't be too soft, you can just hear but can't get away with things because you want them to like you.

299
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:22,950
It's not your goal really to be like that at the end of the day.

300
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:29,710
Like, the kids will realize that you have to be real with them to make it as much as possible.

301
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:32,100
Yeah, that's a really good point.

302
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:40,740
And that's a hard one to avoid if you're working with a kid and you don't you don't want to be, like, mean with parenting.

303
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:46,890
Yeah. So you add on to like establishing in the beginning that like I am kids like, you know,

304
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:51,959
get to know you and I relate to you and I can be afraid to not be your friend but

305
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:55,980
like establishment in the beginning so that the time for you to crack down on them.

306
00:34:55,980 --> 00:35:01,469
Like I definitely understand your point of view, but like here are alternatives that could have been a lot better.

307
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:07,160
So instead of like closing it is the communication is like this is what you should have done the most.

308
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:11,249
Like, okay, these are things you could've done, but I'm not positive.

309
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:16,730
Like, you should have done this, you should have done, but like when you're relating to them singly,

310
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:21,089
actually take the time to connect to their perspective, to actually give different alternatives.

311
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:30,410
I think is has come up with a better way to look into people who are around your age, where you feel like that connection,

312
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:37,570
loss of life so that they see that you're taking in their life surrounding circumstances and everything.

313
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:40,950
Yeah. And yeah, like sort of that providing of resources.

314
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:44,280
Like here's some, here's a range of options that were choices.

315
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:48,239
You did this one and like next step, maybe consider this and this and this. Absolutely.

316
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,500
Yeah, there is this. I think enthusiasm is important.

317
00:35:51,630 --> 00:36:01,860
Like you want a mentor who's like also interested in like engage with you and then just kind of drawing from like my experience as a wellness coach,

318
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:06,569
like not wanting to like wave the finger and tell them that they've done something wrong.

319
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:12,960
It's more about like figuring if they're engaging in some sort of adverse health behavior,

320
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:19,379
how like that fits into their life and maybe where within that they can make changes rather than being like,

321
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:27,360
Oh no, you shouldn't do this, do this, and said, Oh yeah, because that might not be effective and they might not agree with that.

322
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:33,150
And they've, and like for very good reason, like they know how it would or wouldn't fit into their,

323
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:36,659
their life, their life context and circumstances and everything.

324
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:38,370
Absolutely. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

325
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:47,670
I feel like that ties in in my thought, I was like, if I train the motivational interviewing to do that by high school, I don't know.

326
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:53,549
But it's making me think, well, I was thinking about like my mentor and like what makes her good.

327
00:36:53,550 --> 00:37:02,130
I know it's like a different scenario was really adults, but when it comes to like, um, it's exactly motivational interviewing instead of like,

328
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:09,750
so ask questions that challenge my thoughts and get me to think of like the answer versus instead of like criticizing or critiquing.

329
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:17,520
So it's very clear that she's listening, but she like, challenges me by like supporting of like certain questions to like push me.

330
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:26,459
But it doesn't feel like because if someone, like I had someone telling me like, I don't know, like don't do something or like that's not a good idea.

331
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:32,760
Like, I would immediately get, like, defensive, and I feel like teenagers would do the same thing.

332
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:38,080
It's very natural, right? Right. They're primed for that. Yeah, that's good.

333
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:45,659
Absolutely. So there's a lot to it and sort of figuring out the level of intensity or the level of relationship building that

334
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:51,630
can happen in these like transitory lives of youth is I think that's a key challenge for any youth development.

335
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:57,120
You know, the the out-of-school time interventions are really, really important,

336
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:02,790
but sort of making them work well, you have to have the right kind of players involved.

337
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:09,719
So let me talk a little bit about the yes program.

338
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:15,240
So do people. It's interesting because there's kind of a cohorts move through.

339
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:24,330
There used to be like videos about this playing a lot in the like in the entryway of HPT but I don't think they do those over.

340
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:37,079
So this is a program that Marc Zimmerman his and HPT had developed over many years and based on research, based on with many,

341
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:46,350
many, many years of research and points basically looking at like youth strengths, youth resilience, natural mentors.

342
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:53,009
So like, you know, you know somebody in your community and you happen to like share interests and you have occasion to, you know,

343
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:59,489
hang out together and then that person becomes your mentor, like that natural mentor, which is wonderful, but sort of like, how do you create that?

344
00:38:59,490 --> 00:39:00,690
That's really hard, right?

345
00:39:01,890 --> 00:39:12,660
So the Yes program is really focused on youth empowerment and it uses like community based projects, youth driven approaches, etc.

346
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:19,290
So I'll show you guys. Let's see, there's a bunch of videos about.

347
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:23,150
Yes. And I thought that. This one.

348
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:26,780
Where is it? There's Mark. I know Mark.

349
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:32,420
Okay, this Jeremiah is this one.

350
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:37,330
Sorry. There's like. I figured out that the.

351
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:42,810
Sorry, the Russian.

352
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:56,010
Oh, here it is, 21st century skills. So this is kind of an example of like from a teachers perspective.

353
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:59,470
So yes, uses and I'll talk more about the program and just sort of give you a flavor.

354
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:04,750
Yes. Happens and after school settings, it's a classic like after school program.

355
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:13,269
We did do an evaluation where we looked at kids who were in the Yes program and not in the S program doing other things.

356
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:21,969
But as you guys can imagine, it's really hard to find a comparison group because there's a lot of factors that also and also have hard to

357
00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:26,560
generalize because there's a lot of factors that determine whether or not a kid is attending an after school program.

358
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:35,530
But basically the focus of this is that it's a curriculum that I'll outline and it's run by after school teachers and staff.

359
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:41,230
And so they're sort of in that mentoring role, or they can be.

360
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:45,639
But really the curriculum is kind of driven by and designed by students.

361
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:50,050
So I'll just play this one about a part of it and then talk more about it.

362
00:40:55,110 --> 00:41:00,989
We started off the program doing the US curriculum. We also did a really cool thing,

363
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:07,770
which was a scavenger hunt where they had to go and introduce themselves to people to really get to know people in their school and in the community.

364
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:13,770
That was a huge challenge for a lot of them because they had to go and tell something about themselves to a complete stranger.

365
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:23,459
Okay. Just pausing there like this is this took place in like she's probably talking in like, I don't know, 2014 or 15,

366
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:30,960
maybe pre-pandemic and like even at an earlier phase of like screens and phones and everything like that.

367
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:38,760
So regardless of like pandemic induced, you know, social anxiety and all of the different things that that has wrought,

368
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:43,890
this is already a hard developmental stage to like go off and introduce yourself to a stranger in your community.

369
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:53,140
And so just to just to kind of highlight that it's a it's a skill that they're very purposely trying to build in this program.

370
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:59,270
And it's not like, you know, we might call it at age 20 years, professional development.

371
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:02,880
And so, like, what does that mean, you know, in that sort of middle school age?

372
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:05,940
And they're definitely two high school students and they're middle school.

373
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:12,480
So it wasn't a challenge and I think I think they really enjoyed it after that, although they were stressed for the middle of it.

374
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:19,810
When we started looking into doing our service project, we decided to take on different tasks.

375
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:29,129
Some of us looked up prices for the basketball hoop, some of us looked up prices for benches, or how we could incorporate different local businesses.

376
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:36,540
We called many different people, which I think was pretty brave of some middle schoolers to call and ask questions to try to find the best prices.

377
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,390
We did a lot of searching online, which was new to a lot of them.

378
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:43,820
They did not know how to Google for prices and things, so that was a really good learning experience.

379
00:42:43,830 --> 00:42:46,080
I didn't expect to even teach them.

380
00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:52,800
So their project and I'll talk more about the project for their project is to build a basketball hoop in their school.

381
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:55,709
And so that kit they just showed on the on the thing,

382
00:42:55,710 --> 00:43:00,000
I don't know if you guys saw that there's like a like kind of an oldish cell phone parked right there.

383
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,750
So he ends up calling this in a different video.

384
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:08,940
There's like all these little videos, but he ends up calling a place that's actually located in Wisconsin,

385
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:16,469
but that he didn't realize that you're on the phone. And so he's like Wisconsin and she's like, say, thank you very much.

386
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:20,210
I'm so sorry, you know, goodbye. And he, like, just didn't know what to do.

387
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:23,610
He was kind of frozen because he was thinking he's calling somewhere local.

388
00:43:23,610 --> 00:43:26,280
But like, how much do your basketball hoops cost? You know?

389
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:37,229
And so it was just this, like, super concrete example of doing this thing that's like really hard and aversive, but you do it in service of, like,

390
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:42,870
the group project of like we need to figure out how much these basketball hoops cost so that we can do our project because they all got a budget.

391
00:43:42,930 --> 00:43:48,629
And this in this program, they had to work within a budget and like the look on his face and he was like,

392
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:53,100
Oh, you know, and then she kind of helped him, you know, get through that phone call.

393
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:57,959
And then he walks away with like, remember that crazy time I called Wisconsin and I handled it,

394
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:04,800
and I was like able to move on and it like, I didn't, like, disappear in a big shame, you know, I actually, you know, moved on.

395
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:08,110
So that's one example of like many, many.

396
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,680
Looking for skills or teaching as well as doing research.

397
00:44:16,950 --> 00:44:21,570
We had to figure out how we were going to put a basketball hoop in the ground and how we were going to actually keep them there.

398
00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:27,690
So we did a lot of walking around on campus to try to figure out exactly where the best place would be.

399
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:33,150
We had a lot of discussions about so the basketball courts were horizontal, single vertical, should we have one or two?

400
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:39,510
And we took a lot of time on measuring feeling out exactly what size a basketball court should be,

401
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:44,010
where to look that up and forced them to do these things on their own.

402
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:49,979
I didn't give them the answers I could have looked at. The basketball court, wasn't figured out if it was okay out there, but they had to do it.

403
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:57,059
And I think because they had to do those things, it really gave them a sense of pride and taught them a little initiative,

404
00:44:57,060 --> 00:45:00,570
which is something that isn't always taught in a classroom full of 30 students.

405
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:09,209
Okay, let's look. Another example. So math like we talked about math last time was like t one day checking, but they're like measuring, measuring.

406
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:16,020
And those of you guys who've ever built anything in like had to do that like measure and then cut or anything like that.

407
00:45:16,770 --> 00:45:20,040
That's, you know, that's that's a skill. That's an important one.

408
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:22,410
And it's a lesson learned if you do it wrong, right?

409
00:45:23,610 --> 00:45:29,249
So they had a lot of like planning tasks that have they had to kind of figure out and they had to figure out all the steps.

410
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:33,480
So it was like a little kind of project management almost of the project that was in the group.

411
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:40,709
And what she said also about I could have looked up the basketball hoop dimensions, but like I have them do it.

412
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:42,180
So that's another mentoring piece.

413
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:48,660
Like she's not telling them what to do, but she's sort of saying, here's where we need to get what steps are you going to take to get there?

414
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:59,620
It really got the students super involved. I really wanted the kids to be able to make a difference in their community, not just in their school.

415
00:45:59,710 --> 00:46:01,540
A lot of times it doesn't see what we do.

416
00:46:01,570 --> 00:46:09,200
I decided that, yes, I'm going to be a good program to get involved in because I got to instill a sense of community within our school.

417
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:11,370
We don't have a lot of that feeling at our school,

418
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:15,160
and this is a really good opportunity to do something outside of school that can affect the community.

419
00:46:18,270 --> 00:46:25,309
Okay. So there's a bunch of these little videos,

420
00:46:25,310 --> 00:46:30,230
but that just kind of gives you a flavor of like the projects that they were doing and that thing

421
00:46:30,230 --> 00:46:35,660
that she said about how like often what schools are doing the community doesn't isn't aware of.

422
00:46:35,690 --> 00:46:42,450
So I think that's also helpful to like just cogitate on a little bit because if you're, you know,

423
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:47,630
in a school setting like you want to make sure like if there's some awesome program happening in the school setting,

424
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:51,920
you know, advertising that and connecting that to the community and what.

425
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:53,780
Yes. To which I'll talk about.

426
00:46:53,780 --> 00:47:00,560
But they actually really brought in community people for these sort of bigger events like breaking ground on the basketball hoop.

427
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:06,640
Or they did a bunch of different neighborhood projects that were very community facing and community evidence.

428
00:47:06,650 --> 00:47:11,719
And so I think that that was a way that the community was like, Oh, hey, wow, we are investing in our youth.

429
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:15,920
You know, it was very overt way to show that.

430
00:47:17,330 --> 00:47:20,330
Okay. So just so you know, like yes.

431
00:47:20,330 --> 00:47:23,240
Is based on a lot of it's a research also theory.

432
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:30,470
So thinking about like, you know, is community and neighborhood influences on kids going through the school context.

433
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:35,590
Um, this is sort of just roughly what was covered in the curriculum.

434
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:36,860
So there's a bunch of lessons.

435
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:47,899
What's good about yes, as it turns out, is that these are pretty like first unit one youth as leaders and also has like an identity unit.

436
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:50,870
So like ethnic identity was a big thing in. Yes.

437
00:47:51,350 --> 00:47:57,920
And sort of figuring out like who am I and what are my leadership skills because youth are going to enter and think,

438
00:47:58,460 --> 00:48:04,430
I don't know if I have leadership skills. Right. And so sort of identifying, hey, these are the things that are leadership skills.

439
00:48:04,430 --> 00:48:07,640
You have these things was a really powerful part of this program.

440
00:48:08,030 --> 00:48:14,750
So that was kind of always the first unit. And then from there we could sort of switch around the order of some units.

441
00:48:15,620 --> 00:48:21,100
But I'll talk about the building intergenerational partnerships part and then this planning for change and then action and reflection,

442
00:48:21,110 --> 00:48:25,610
this planning for change with like community project. So like what community project are you doing?

443
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:34,370
Those of you who have worked in like research settings and schools know like so many things interfere with your research project.

444
00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:42,949
And so that was totally true for this as well. And the main thing was that the planning for change things projects usually needed to happen

445
00:48:42,950 --> 00:48:47,629
kind of like in May or over the summer because of weather in Michigan and all of these things.

446
00:48:47,630 --> 00:48:53,150
So this was sort of that we wanted to get through as much of this before we got to this unit.

447
00:48:53,150 --> 00:49:03,170
So just to get a little like reality based, school based research, sometimes it's hard to do everything exactly as you want it.

448
00:49:03,170 --> 00:49:09,409
But here's the sort of setting for yes after school program.

449
00:49:09,410 --> 00:49:12,590
This is a lot of why the units would switch around.

450
00:49:12,590 --> 00:49:18,580
So like if you're in a school setting and you're doing an after school program, there can be events in that school day that happen.

451
00:49:18,590 --> 00:49:23,239
So like there were some, you know, violence incidents and things that happen.

452
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:29,630
And then that day the program would be like converted to sort of processing the incident as opposed to like,

453
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:35,390
hey, we're supposed to be talking about ethnic identity. But you know what? This huge gang fight just happened outside school.

454
00:49:35,390 --> 00:49:37,610
We actually have to really address that before we can do that.

455
00:49:37,610 --> 00:49:42,679
So that sort of went towards, I think like relationship building and the mentor, you know,

456
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:47,300
after school personally taking time to kind of get to know the kids context and circumstances.

457
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:52,070
So that was sort of like an implementation science lesson.

458
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:59,660
And the thing about the neighborhood like so this is that intergenerational partnership, peace and mentoring.

459
00:50:00,470 --> 00:50:06,799
What was really cool about the Yes program is that we had the kids actually like interview

460
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:11,000
parent or not parents interview adults who came to want to work with the program.

461
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:17,670
And so like we called the, the adults were like neighborhood advocates or the teachers in the school.

462
00:50:17,670 --> 00:50:24,440
And so neighborhood advocates would be people like I'm a painter and I had painting skills and I like know how that works.

463
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:30,229
And these kids want to paint a bench. So like they reached out to the community, they found somebody with those skills,

464
00:50:30,230 --> 00:50:38,719
and then they interviewed them to see if they would be like a kid, appropriate mentor or neighborhood advocate in this case.

465
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:46,010
So this idea that the kids were sort of driving the decision making was really important.

466
00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:49,040
And that even came down like this is one of the interview times.

467
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:52,670
So like people from the community came and they were like, Oh, I want to work with this youth program.

468
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:56,450
The kids were like, We're going to decide if you can work with us.

469
00:50:56,450 --> 00:51:02,720
So we talked a lot about like, can adults like take direction from kids and, you know,

470
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:08,959
not be really like proactive but sort of stand back and say, oh, gosh, I know exactly how to do this thing they're trying to do.

471
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:13,280
It's really frustrating that I could, like, swoop in and do it, but I need to have them do it.

472
00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:19,370
So that was, I think, kind of a cool process like from the get go that the youth got to interview these adults.

473
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:26,210
And so that was a good thing about. Graham as well. I mean, so we had a whole unit on ethnic identity.

474
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:32,960
And then this also just, you know, for those of you guys who have been work with different programs and thought about like program adaptation.

475
00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:37,070
So people were really interested in using yes. In lots of different communities.

476
00:51:37,070 --> 00:51:43,310
And so this was a lot of interesting discussion because we were like trying to figure out how to adapt,

477
00:51:43,730 --> 00:51:48,170
you know, the sort of ethnic identity components that had been developed with this community in Flint.

478
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:54,470
So it's very African-American youth focused. But then there are some communities in California that want to share with the Latino communities,

479
00:51:55,220 --> 00:52:00,110
etc. So there were a lot of different cool adaptations that were made to this program.

480
00:52:01,850 --> 00:52:05,840
And I mentioned that we did start with that identity unit because that's kind of where they were.

481
00:52:06,470 --> 00:52:12,290
And then this is just some examples of the like outward facing community pieces.

482
00:52:12,290 --> 00:52:17,479
So these are this is at a school, but you can see like the, you know, the before pictures on the after picture.

483
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:21,709
And they were just very invested like in figuring out what program, you know, what,

484
00:52:21,710 --> 00:52:26,900
what, what activity they wanted to do in the community and what it would look like.

485
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:31,370
And then they had to figure out, like, what it cost. And so here's another one.

486
00:52:31,370 --> 00:52:34,930
And I don't know if you guys have seen this is like up in various places and HPT,

487
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:42,409
but it's a big wall that they painted and Flint and this was all about you can sort of see but you can this

488
00:52:42,410 --> 00:52:50,030
was like sort of about violence causes and slavery and ships and lots of different details are in this mural.

489
00:52:50,030 --> 00:52:55,489
And it all really came sort of from this collaborative ideas of kids and community members.

490
00:52:55,490 --> 00:53:01,310
So just some examples of those. Let's see what else I'm going to say.

491
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:11,730
Yes, I guess the other thing to say is that we were able to actually evaluate, yes,

492
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:14,940
we did all this implementation work on really changing around the curriculum.

493
00:53:15,450 --> 00:53:20,460
And then we also evaluated the impact and we did find positive impacts of the program.

494
00:53:21,810 --> 00:53:26,530
And so I would say, again, people are interested in this youth development space.

495
00:53:26,550 --> 00:53:29,880
There's been some cool work on that here.

496
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:37,260
Another thing that they did find about. Yes. Which I don't think is on this slide.

497
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:44,280
No. But so they did these neighborhood beautification projects, not not in each case, but in some cases.

498
00:53:44,610 --> 00:53:52,530
And they actually were able to then overlay like crime data from police reports and look at the sort of

499
00:53:52,530 --> 00:53:59,100
geographic spread like positivity spread basically beyond the neighborhood beautification program projects.

500
00:53:59,550 --> 00:54:08,760
And so they they actually were able to sort of extend this work and show when there's a beautification project happening in the crime rates,

501
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:15,960
like in a proportional way, you know, related to where that project is located, actually decreased.

502
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:23,340
So it's a pretty awesome and linking up sort of youth development,

503
00:54:24,270 --> 00:54:29,040
neighborhood projects and community awareness and this sort of like what I would call like,

504
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:34,050
you know, this like hard crime administrative data from police reports.

505
00:54:35,070 --> 00:54:39,420
So just presenting this like overall project really briefly,

506
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:44,970
but just to sort of illustrate like this can be a really powerful from youth to community direction impact.

507
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:56,100
Yeah. I wonder about like when people are like doing programs like this as a participant, is there any concern about them leaving?

508
00:54:56,100 --> 00:55:02,399
Like so they do all this work and then like as they age or maybe go off to college or something and they leave,

509
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:05,430
there's a problem back or like how do they.

510
00:55:06,270 --> 00:55:09,420
Is there any like. Yeah, you mean like the individual participants.

511
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:17,489
Yeah. And just like if they're, if using like this knowledge throughout the community and then the community may be receptive to it,

512
00:55:17,490 --> 00:55:21,600
but the crime that whatever is still there, they leave.

513
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:26,550
Like, is there any concern about like capacity building in that regard?

514
00:55:26,580 --> 00:55:33,060
Oh, yeah. Yeah. So one of the things, a few things I would say actually one of the videos has one of the participants,

515
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:36,380
you know, like from a middle school or he came back and was like a youth leader.

516
00:55:36,390 --> 00:55:38,940
So like, if you ever have that, that's amazing.

517
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:45,980
But I think because so many of these projects were like outward facing and very visible in the community,

518
00:55:45,990 --> 00:55:52,430
the community had a really positive, was like positive, positively disposed to the program.

519
00:55:53,730 --> 00:56:02,610
And yeah, I mean, that's not the only thing that's going to change crime rates, obviously, but it's had pretty decent sustainability over time.

520
00:56:02,610 --> 00:56:13,620
And so one of the ways that like is grant proposals to keep it going and community based grant proposals to keep it going.

521
00:56:14,310 --> 00:56:25,370
We've talked about that crime effect because that's impactful on, you know, a good number to say to your grant funders like,

522
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:30,270
hey, you know, you should fund this youth afterschool programs because of crime rates.

523
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:36,360
So yeah, I mean, it's oh, there's always issues of sustainability and capacity for sure.

524
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:40,409
The afterschool programs, I think I mentioned this also be incredible.

525
00:56:40,410 --> 00:56:45,239
Yours, you know who your interventionist is, who your mentor is, who your teacher is,

526
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:51,569
who the people are in your program can make such a difference, do always make such a difference.

527
00:56:51,570 --> 00:57:00,180
And so in this program, similarly, there were like teachers who just like this changed their life and this became kind of what they did,

528
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:05,070
you know, as their as as their main activity.

529
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:12,570
But, of course, that's not everybody. And so, you know, as with all interventions, I think that involves humans.

530
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:14,940
There's going to be that factor. Right.

531
00:57:16,230 --> 00:57:22,650
And that's also why I think it is helpful to really carefully think through like, who are we going to get to staff our program?

532
00:57:22,650 --> 00:57:31,260
Like if you guys are hiring people, right? And thinking like, here's this great group of resumes of people and like how to understand,

533
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:36,270
like who should be, who I should be talking to to do my programs.

534
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:42,330
So I think especially that youth mentor, because also like adolescents are cynical and you know,

535
00:57:42,390 --> 00:57:47,310
I mean, it can be you really have to have those great people who love working with you.

536
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:59,070
Super important. Actually, that's kind of sort of on the next like summary kind of slide.

537
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:04,780
So like this idea of positive development, we don't want to only focus on preventing bad behaviors,

538
00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:09,689
quote unquote, but by promoting protective factors and positive development.

539
00:58:09,690 --> 00:58:16,360
And hopefully we do have that impact on the behaviors we would like to see less of or the activities that the youth aren't even doing.

540
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:18,010
That could be crime rates in the community.

541
00:58:19,690 --> 00:58:25,299
Important to connect it to the own community, the youth own community and have that reflected to the community like again,

542
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:31,230
advertising the activities that you're doing. And then for youth in particular, building skills.

543
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:36,850
So having youth walk away with that feeling of like I have higher self-efficacy,

544
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:41,229
you know, they may not say that you hope they say that on your evaluation survey,

545
00:58:41,230 --> 00:58:46,930
but like they actually learned how to do something new and have something that they didn't know how to do before.

546
00:58:46,930 --> 00:58:52,419
So that's critically important. And then the other idea is that engaging youth in both,

547
00:58:52,420 --> 00:58:56,470
like the setting of the goals and sort of figuring out how the program is going to going to run.

548
00:58:57,220 --> 00:59:00,220
What we want to do in this program. And so that's a balance, right?

549
00:59:00,220 --> 00:59:05,830
Because you can come in as an adult, as like a public health professional and say, look, I got this awesome program.

550
00:59:05,830 --> 00:59:14,080
It's evidence based and it worked before. And then you're like, Oh, but I have to get my youth to, you know, shape the program.

551
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:21,670
Like, how do those two things sort of coexist? And also out of the CDP are right, like you can come in and say, look, I have these great ideas.

552
00:59:21,670 --> 00:59:26,739
I know what to do in a community. And the community is like, Yeah, we want to be over here.

553
00:59:26,740 --> 00:59:31,149
And so if you're doing a community based participatory research, you really have to go over there to where the community is.

554
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:38,020
So it's that again, adaptation type process is important and then your energy and experience that enthusiasm.

555
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:44,980
So yeah, absolutely. The people who are running the program need to be youth people.

556
00:59:48,220 --> 00:59:54,070
And the other thing I just wanted to share as tools and resources,

557
00:59:55,210 --> 01:00:01,390
there's a lot of interest right now in child impact assessments like really from a policy perspective.

558
01:00:01,390 --> 01:00:09,640
So this idea of if some policy comes down the pike, how will it impact youth and maybe youth and families?

559
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:14,350
And so we've talked a lot in here about child care type policies for school policies,

560
01:00:14,350 --> 01:00:22,090
school board policies that are increasingly important to know about.

561
01:00:22,870 --> 01:00:29,259
And so these are just some this is a site that is looking at like, again,

562
01:00:29,260 --> 01:00:41,710
providing tools to kind of evaluate how these policies might shape kids and what are what programs as a result of those policies might reach kids.

563
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:48,850
So if people are interested in the policy space and how that might impact child development health, that's a good resource.

564
01:00:50,050 --> 01:00:58,720
They also just kind of give some like like tool kits and worksheets about if you're starting this process, like who should you engage, right?

565
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:04,930
And so again, linking to like the intervention paper idea, like who should be at the table if you're going to try to develop an intervention.

566
01:01:07,270 --> 01:01:15,490
This is more of a report from there's actually a juvenile justice group in Michigan that's kind of doing some similar stuff.

567
01:01:16,780 --> 01:01:22,089
But this is a report that just sort of goes over some ways to be a youth advocate

568
01:01:22,090 --> 01:01:26,710
and to work with youth and to do youth advocacy and youth led advocacy.

569
01:01:27,790 --> 01:01:37,120
So I think those are two potentially, again, helpful resources for people who are interested in this area and working with youth.

570
01:01:39,370 --> 01:01:46,089
And the other thing I would just say is like I know I talk a lot about relational health, like parent child,

571
01:01:46,090 --> 01:01:51,430
young infants, little kid relational health, but like teens, relational health is really important to obviously.

572
01:01:51,430 --> 01:01:58,300
And so we have like peers, but also that adult relationship can be really critically important for kids.

573
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:10,180
And again, one more kids count thing that's sort of pointing that out and then just sort of bigger picture.

574
01:02:10,180 --> 01:02:12,669
And I know there are some young adults in the room,

575
01:02:12,670 --> 01:02:21,000
but these I like to just sort of show this because it's the sort of as it goes, like mental check of like, do I do these things?

576
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:26,410
So this this is like a little report that came out and there have been some more.

577
01:02:26,410 --> 01:02:32,320
But these are just sort of like health habits to think about as you're, you know, are in your twenties.

578
01:02:33,790 --> 01:02:36,969
And we probably all know a lot of these things.

579
01:02:36,970 --> 01:02:44,860
But I do like to say also find a job you love if you can, or at least components of a job that you know, the components of your job that you love.

580
01:02:45,550 --> 01:02:54,900
Because that really is important for. You emotionally, if possible, as well as you know, you need to make some money to feed your self physically.

581
01:02:56,520 --> 01:03:00,920
But I also like to point out in this list they didn't address sleeper media.

582
01:03:00,930 --> 01:03:04,260
So those are also important things, just like keep on your little mentalist.

583
01:03:06,030 --> 01:03:13,020
And then the final thing I'll say is that if you guys I know, like holiday seasons are coming up.

584
01:03:14,010 --> 01:03:18,660
So if you guys are like in a position of like gift giving or anything to like little kids,

585
01:03:18,990 --> 01:03:25,530
there are some awesome lists of books out there that are like inclusive,

586
01:03:25,770 --> 01:03:31,649
looking at lots of different family and child and relationship relational experiences.

587
01:03:31,650 --> 01:03:36,450
And there's some just really amazing like child literature out there.

588
01:03:36,450 --> 01:03:39,990
And I think I hope that if, you know, taking away from this class,

589
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:48,330
if we can get in there early and change kids attitudes like that, that generational change hopefully should follow.

590
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:50,549
It may take a little while,

591
01:03:50,550 --> 01:04:02,970
but I think that that's especially now in this era of like book banning in schools and the activism of school boards kind of against books like this.

592
01:04:03,690 --> 01:04:05,999
It's really, really important to know about them.

593
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:10,340
And there's resources that I'm happy to share more, and I can actually post them on the class website.

594
01:04:10,350 --> 01:04:15,059
But I think this is important to know about because there are some amazing, amazing,

595
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:20,340
amazing resources out there that are not like as widely known as a lot of books.

596
01:04:20,340 --> 01:04:23,880
So there's, there's definitely good books out there.

597
01:04:24,510 --> 01:04:27,629
And if people haven't read Wonder, I know it was a movie too.

598
01:04:27,630 --> 01:04:31,620
It's kind of good movie, but it's an amazing book and like even for grown ups.

599
01:04:34,650 --> 01:04:44,720
And so yeah, I feel like those are sort of the core, the core class messages and we can pause there.

600
01:04:44,730 --> 01:04:54,780
But I do like to just say, like if you guys feel like it and have a moment, email me some suggestions for improvement feedback session.

601
01:04:54,780 --> 01:04:59,849
Do you like best session you would drop readings you like or readings you suggest a change?

602
01:04:59,850 --> 01:05:08,430
Because I'm always like tinkering, which is fun and you know, if you want to fill out evaluations, that's great and that's all.

603
01:05:08,730 --> 01:05:12,990
So thanks, you guys. Very good class. And I will probably say something.

604
01:05:16,350 --> 01:05:19,499
Thank you guys. But yeah, keep in touch.

605
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:27,080
And especially like if you guys have questions about like Allison, do you know about any job stuff, challenge family stuff, where should I go?

606
01:05:27,090 --> 01:05:31,320
You know, I'm always happy to, like, feel filled. Those questions so cool.

607
01:05:31,620 --> 01:05:46,870
Thank you. And have a good break, everyone. The club didn't collect the.

608
01:05:48,190 --> 01:05:53,079
That was fine, too. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

609
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:58,470
I think I try to send things around so I don't have to remember to look here.

610
01:05:58,820 --> 01:06:02,950
Yeah, well, I like talking to a lot of the things that you sent me on the list.

611
01:06:03,310 --> 01:06:11,080
It's like meeting with some of them. Oh, some of them were busy with, like, searching for factory meet with some more, like after he done.

612
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:14,620
So it was really helpful. Oh, for me. Oh, God.

613
01:06:14,890 --> 01:06:18,780
Keep me posted on stuff that you find out. So hopefully.

614
01:06:18,910 --> 01:06:43,810
Yeah, that would be awesome. What do you think? 120 5000 with another question?

615
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:50,919
Yeah, I've been writing it. I had a moment. I actually want to double check to issue something.

616
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:55,959
I try. Yeah, yeah. But I'm still doing the topic of, like, eastender.

617
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:59,710
You can just ask for an introduction.

618
01:06:59,890 --> 01:07:06,140
I want to propose is just like increasing access to gender affirming care in primary care settings.

619
01:07:06,230 --> 01:07:10,810
Oh, okay. Because that has been like the first practice.

620
01:07:11,050 --> 01:07:17,860
Yeah. Well, like, get kids connected kind of underground around my connection to different service providers.

621
01:07:18,820 --> 01:07:26,379
But I just want to make sure that like if I'm kind of like I'm training pediatricians in my family,

622
01:07:26,380 --> 01:07:31,420
my docs to be more like gender inclusive and gender affirming in their practice,

623
01:07:31,420 --> 01:07:36,550
if that's what I'm on the right track of still being an intervention, you know, not directly working with them.

624
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:41,810
Yes, I think it totally everything that like if you tick through like that.

625
01:07:42,830 --> 01:07:49,960
Yeah. And just looking at how much I try to be consistent with myself, I feel like I need it.

626
01:07:49,990 --> 01:07:53,460
I always edit a little bit, but yeah, yeah, that's okay.

627
01:07:54,250 --> 01:07:57,420
That should be just. Just right. Okay.

628
01:07:57,550 --> 01:08:03,280
Because it's like it's like people that are going to be talking to the kids have that.

629
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:09,099
And so yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. No very cool thoughts on that because I was getting a little nervous.

630
01:08:09,100 --> 01:08:14,700
But I appreciate that. And thank you. Thank you.

631
01:08:15,820 --> 01:08:19,420
Yeah. Yeah, thank you. And that. Are you still working with Jenny?

632
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:23,680
Yeah. Yes. And I'll be doing that next semester as well.

633
01:08:23,950 --> 01:08:29,349
Oh, good. I have a new research assistant starting and things are really picking up.

634
01:08:29,350 --> 01:08:36,400
It's been quite busy, but good. Finally, finally in like the thick of it, which I've been reminded for for a while.

635
01:08:36,430 --> 01:08:41,169
So it's good. That's good. Well, I'm hope for hope then. I'm actually kind of similar.

636
01:08:41,170 --> 01:08:45,430
Your paper like this. We just submitted the thing to look at,

637
01:08:45,430 --> 01:08:53,409
like trying to make the pediatric clinic in Ypsi more of like a pediatric medical home community focus point, medical home.

638
01:08:53,410 --> 01:08:59,200
So I'm hoping that we get a chance to work on that. Yeah, Jenny and I and others and yeah.

639
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:04,050
So I feel like there are definitely be some people in this class. I'd be like, you'll be interested in like working on this.

640
01:09:04,940 --> 01:09:09,450
That was really cool. It would be it would be really cool.

641
01:09:09,530 --> 01:09:12,850
We'll see. We'll see. And I feel like we could do parts of it kind of no matter what.

642
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:16,630
Yeah, that's my thought. Yeah. Yeah. I'm dying for some info about that.

643
01:09:16,630 --> 01:09:20,100
Yeah. Yeah, that would be fun. Yeah.

644
01:09:20,100 --> 01:09:26,140
Have you hopes? But this.

645
01:15:05,290 --> 01:15:06,230
I anything.
