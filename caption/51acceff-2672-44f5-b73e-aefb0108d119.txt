1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:00,270
Marilyn.

2
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:08,840
Was that like their five yard line right behind their goal and like they sacked the QB, the ball went live and they got a touchdown off of that.

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:14,580
It was so sad. Oh, it was brutal. Yeah, very, very intense.

4
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:22,700
That's awesome. Yeah, I think it's more likely that.

5
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:26,690
But I was asking about the possible links. I was emailing her to like say thank you for coming, you know.

6
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:30,359
Oh yeah. Should I mention this? Oh, yeah. Max just asked me to.

7
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:36,270
I'm going to her today and now I think she's too.

8
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,230
I know, I know. Well, it's like for the designer company, man.

9
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:51,989
Mark, I know. Didn't like the message, but I can't believe I just like any kind of message big time coming on, you know, just trying to pick a time.

10
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:55,830
Everyone's available and true. Yeah, I heard.

11
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:02,610
No, no, no stress. This was like I already I was like, okay, maybe next morning where I was.

12
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:10,610
Yeah. Yeah. So the HBCU faculty area, I think, you know.

13
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:18,480
I know, I do know. She's very that's why she sat there and then I'm like, I thought, know you haven't told me to move.

14
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:25,230
Are you all right? So I think we're going to get started today.

15
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:35,399
We have throughout the semester we've been talking about high cost interventions that I really want to highlight that again today because

16
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:42,420
I think that's the thing that really drives a lot of what we're talking about and it drives a lot of the interest in cost effects.

17
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:46,350
So I want to go through a few examples today.

18
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:51,720
One is some therapies for chronic retinal diseases. This is a project that I'm worked on.

19
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,959
Some people at the Tel Aviv Center just down the hill, and also students.

20
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:02,340
So students can sometimes be involved in these kind of projects as well, a former student person.

21
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:07,380
So I'll give you some background on some of these retinal diseases.

22
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:12,510
Talk about policy importance and then talk about cost effectiveness that fits in here.

23
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:23,460
So these two examples I'll go through briefly with here are diabetic macular edema and age related macular degeneration of diabetic macular edema.

24
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:27,120
As the name suggests, it's caused by diabetes.

25
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:33,660
As you know, diabetes can lead to a lot of different complications, one of which is we know as blindness.

26
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:41,790
And there's age related macular degeneration. This is just something that happens kind of with old age and it's loss of central vision.

27
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:51,389
So this picture here might be similar to diabetic demand, and the second might be similar to what you might see age related macular degeneration,

28
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:55,860
both of which are not fine and leading causes of blindness in the United States.

29
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,829
Recently, though said recently, the last decade or so,

30
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:08,330
there have been a couple of medications or several medications that are developed to address these issues.

31
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:15,650
And just as an example, so these are two from like a decade ago or so, there are a few more that have come on the market since then.

32
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:23,990
Very similar, though. They're called anti vascular endothelial growth factors developed again by Genentech.

33
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:36,980
Originally they were designed to Avastin or bevacizumab was developed first here and designed for treatment of certain cancers.

34
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,360
The idea is if you have a tumor growing in your body, it needs blood vessels to feed it.

35
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:48,190
And this reduces the growth of blood vessels.

36
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:57,680
And these these eye conditions are they can be exacerbated by excess fluid in the eyes.

37
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:05,180
The damage to the retina. So reducing the growth of unnecessary blood vessels can potentially help with these diseases as well.

38
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:10,660
So anyway, originally Avastin or bevacizumab was developed for cancer treatment.

39
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:12,530
You may have heard about it for cancer treatment.

40
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:17,960
Again, it's it's it's just another medication that might be given to reduce the cost of growth of blood vessels.

41
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:32,780
And then an engineer said, Hey, wow, this is great, let's try to develop Lucentis or ranibizumab, and we will develop it for these eye diseases.

42
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:37,370
And lo and behold, it seems to work for the GI diseases. So again,

43
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:51,920
they went through a bunch of FDA trials to give the arm to get ran a bit or sorry bevacizumab Lucentis or sorry Avastin approved for cancers.

44
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:56,520
And then. The major problem centers for the Arts.

45
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:04,080
Now, interestingly, if you give someone Avastin for cancer, you give them a large dose in an infusion center.

46
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:09,840
So you can as you can't read back there, this is for intravenous use.

47
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:16,860
So this is a large vial that would be given intravenously, systemically for for cancer treatment.

48
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:26,910
This eye injection here is a small little file that's actually injected directly into the eye for these diseases.

49
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:36,740
So as these. As Lucentis was kind of going through its clinical trials for the eye conditions.

50
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:48,469
There'd be someone giving a presentation at some sort of biology conference saying, Look, we're developing Lucentis ranibizumab here, phase one.

51
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:54,800
Phase two trials seem to be promising and all these ophthalmologists are sitting in the audience going, Wow, that's really exciting.

52
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,950
And they're saying, I've got a lot of patients who are going blind here.

53
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:03,770
And all the initial indications are actually this can actually reverse some of that blindness.

54
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:09,200
Sounds really great, but the outcome just can't give their patients Lucentis an abysmal.

55
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:15,140
It's not available yet. It hasn't gone through FDA approval. So they say, well, I know we have Avastin.

56
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:27,000
In our pharmacy for the cancer patients. I'll see if we can get our pharmacist to split up this large dose of Avastin into small doses.

57
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:30,510
And then maybe I can give that small those to my patients.

58
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:38,400
So there are optometrists using Avastin or bevacizumab off label for these diseases as people are kind of learning about this.

59
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:45,240
And so then right before the Ranibizumab was getting FDA approval, you know,

60
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,870
someone from the pharmacy company would present, hey, welcome with great results.

61
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:53,759
And then, you know, maybe someone else in the conference would be presenting their off label results saying,

62
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,850
Hey, look, in our clinic, we gave a bunch of people bevacizumab.

63
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:08,330
And it also seems to work. So later on, both the U.S. and the U.K. government did some randomized trials to compare both of these drugs.

64
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:11,720
I actually found them to be very, very similar.

65
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:17,570
So you can use the unlabeled drug and it's gone throughout the FDA approval, 2000 and 2000 hours a dose.

66
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:22,550
Or you can use the off label drug here, $50 dose.

67
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:26,060
Now, it's not $50 for cancer because it's a large dose given cancer.

68
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:32,000
But when you take that large dose for cancer and split up into tiny doses to be injected into your eye, it's about $50 a dose.

69
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:37,550
Now, the concern and the concern, if you're Genentech, is what actually mean.

70
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:41,600
I'll ask you guys, what's your concern if you're Genentech, by the way, you've manufactured both these products.

71
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:47,290
What's your concern? I would say like the long term side effects.

72
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,470
Right. So you might be concerned about long term side effects, right?

73
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:56,200
Well, I will say, though, for all of these drugs, when they go through FDA approval,

74
00:07:56,710 --> 00:08:00,160
you probably know about short term side effects in the first half, in the first six months to a year.

75
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:02,920
You probably don't know a whole lot about long term side effects.

76
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:10,390
I will say in the cancer trials where that says Avastin is given systemically throughout the entire body,

77
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:16,030
there was a higher there were higher rates of cardiovascular events, heart attacks and strokes.

78
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:20,810
So very serious things that that you don't want to happen. Yeah.

79
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:28,070
I think they're like the manufacturers are worried about like the fact that you can do it for $50 and test what they want you to do it for $20.

80
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:32,899
Exactly. Right. Um, and they kind of it's hard for them to stop.

81
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:37,960
You know, you're oncologists are buying, you know, these large doses for cancer.

82
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:44,660
They want to sell that for for cancer. But they also prefer to buy their 2000 gross drug for the eye injections.

83
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:51,530
And by the way, they probably spent, you know, $50 million or whatever getting this through clinical trials.

84
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:58,220
Right. But wait, wait. We spend a ton of money creating a special medication, by the way.

85
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:05,540
And if you talk to people genetic, they will tell you, look, this molecule, although it's very similar, it stops the growth of blood vessels.

86
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:10,940
It is a smaller molecule than the other one. And because of these countries subsidy,

87
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:17,360
we actually think Lucentis ranibizumab is better than this one because this one was specifically developed for the eye,

88
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,610
it went through all the FDA approvals and so forth.

89
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:30,920
But yeah, it's it's challenging for Genentech or Roche here because yeah, they don't want to they want people paying for the $50 dose drug.

90
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,030
They prefer that they spend $2,000.

91
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:42,590
So anyways, there are these head to head trials in the US, in the UK and basically had very, very similar efficacy.

92
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:46,700
Um, so much of that you couldn't really tell the two apart in the trials that they ran.

93
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,930
Now could you have run bigger trials and maybe seen a small difference potentially?

94
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:59,740
But, but you know, it was, you know, thousands of people there were there were potentially differences in side effect race.

95
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,610
But also that's hard to tell.

96
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:08,320
And oftentimes when you have really low rates of bad things happening, it's hard to tell if the rates are different into in two groups.

97
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:14,450
Let's say you have a thousand people in this group and a thousand people in that group, and the rate of heart attack is like one in a thousand.

98
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:20,700
It's going to be hard to tell if the rates are different group. There have also been.

99
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:26,820
So these were kind of randomized trials. There are some Medicare claims analyzes that looked at people who had received ranibizumab

100
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:31,290
and bevacizumab and found the rates of side effects and so forth were similar as well.

101
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:32,780
Yeah.

102
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:46,670
Now I want to point out here that really bevacizumab randomization took up about $2 billion or one sixth of the Medicare Part B drug budget in 2010.

103
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:58,219
And this is yeah. So at the time when we did our first analysis, this was, you know, a big chunk of spending.

104
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:02,360
Although I will say this is Medicare Part B spending.

105
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:10,340
What does Medicare what how does Medicare or what's that between Medicare Part B and other Medicare drug spend?

106
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:17,770
Well, what is the Medicare what's Medicare Part A, B, C and D?

107
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:24,300
Do you know what those are, what each one of those does? So A is for hospitals.

108
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:33,950
B, As for outpatient, yeah, physician services and outpatient and C is Medicare Advantage and A D is outpatient drugs.

109
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,809
So this now this isn't so this isn't all drugs. It's just Medicare Part B drugs.

110
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:44,150
But physician administered drugs are often really expensive, right? Sometimes the pills can be expensive, too.

111
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:48,540
But oftentimes if you're in some sort of infusion or injections and so forth, they're quite expensive.

112
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:53,509
And so this is, you know, one sixth of the Medicare Part B drug budget of of a drug budget,

113
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:58,880
which has a lot of expensive, you know, chemotherapies and other things like that.

114
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:07,280
So we built a markov model of Vision C, a lot of you know, you know, the eye charts, say 2020 and so forth.

115
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,460
This is better vision. This is worse almost blindness.

116
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:21,230
And then we also did include potential for strokes and heart attacks as well, although those rates are quite low.

117
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:29,480
So in this analysis, we can kind of get a sense of, well, what we think the health outcomes might be.

118
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:33,080
And the Lucentis here,

119
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:41,240
the expensive drug might have slightly better chance of vision and lower rates of eye infections and these embolism and so forth.

120
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:49,430
But it had a cost effectiveness ratio of $10 million per point or something, so quite expensive.

121
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:57,740
Now new probabilistic sensitivity analysis here, too, and the kind of low chance that ranibizumab would be cost effective.

122
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:02,890
And then can also do threshold analyzes.

123
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:06,130
Thinking about some of those long term side effects that we don't know a whole lot about.

124
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:11,620
So here's the probability of one of these cardiovascular accidents or strokes.

125
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:21,160
Sure, sure, sure. Or vascular access. And if they're equivalent and bevacizumab is preferred, which is too surprising.

126
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:29,220
But the rates would have to be. A one and a half percent higher with ranibizumab and with that is as well.

127
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:33,840
In order for ranibizumab to be preferred, I think it's probably not too surprising.

128
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:40,400
Right? Stroke is a pretty serious deal. But the rates seen in the trial were much, much lower than that.

129
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:46,160
So it's highly unlikely that bevacizumab would have a rate that much higher.

130
00:13:53,680 --> 00:14:00,220
We also did a kind of budget impact analysis because this was an interesting thing here, because it was taking up so much of Medicare's budget.

131
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:07,240
So we looked at some kind of alternative scenarios here. What would happen if everyone started using bevacizumab?

132
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:13,080
Everyone started using ranibizumab. In order to do this, we have to think about, you know, what's the population size?

133
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:17,170
How many of them have this disease? Who's getting treatment, and where does the final cost here?

134
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:21,070
So we looked at kind of the entire population. Think about both diabetics and the elderly.

135
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:24,640
Getting diabetic macular edema or macular degeneration.

136
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:34,480
And then if you have macular edema and also macular degeneration, it needs to be a specific type and clinically significant.

137
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,440
And then are you getting anti-VEGF therapy and then you're back generation?

138
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:42,070
Is it the kind that can be treated with this and then get the anti-VEGF there?

139
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:49,180
So kind of simulated. What's the U.S. population of diabetics going to look like over time?

140
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:55,200
And how many of the people have clinically significant diabetic macular edema

141
00:14:56,910 --> 00:15:02,969
and will have age related backwards degeneration and then look at adoption.

142
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:06,600
I think I've shown you kind of a curve like this before here, which if we're thinking about budgets,

143
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:13,200
is try to match, you know, how would uptake occur over time with these new therapies?

144
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,730
And adoption is never going to be 100% also.

145
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:20,160
So there's kind of a maximum adoption that might actually happen here.

146
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:25,230
And so what we're able to do is kind of simulate what we think the long term costs might be.

147
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:35,490
Cost to Medicare, billions of dollars. And so the base case was if you had the kind of current mix and actually in 2010 or so,

148
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:43,170
about two thirds of people were using the off label bevacizumab and about one third were using the label and the mismatch.

149
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:51,270
But if you kind of followed along that trajectory, you'd spend about, you know, 20, $20 billion over over a decade or so.

150
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:56,790
Now, if everyone used bevacizumab, you could save that $20 billion or so.

151
00:15:57,150 --> 00:16:03,420
And if something happened were somehow bevacizumab were maybe legal or something like that, everyone had to use ranibizumab.

152
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:09,870
Then you'd, you know, jump up and spend $60 million something, you know, really, really expensive.

153
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:14,160
So we can now only look at is something cost effective again, think about cost effectiveness.

154
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:18,510
Is value for money going into the grocery store, you're buying a can of beans.

155
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:22,470
This can of beans is cheaper than that can of beans. It's value for money.

156
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:30,630
But this is budget impact. What's the total impact on your budget? How big is that receipt at the end of your get in program?

157
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:31,740
How much do you spend on things?

158
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:39,060
So this is something where we thought, you know, this could be really, really expensive if everyone starts using cannabis.

159
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:43,680
Now, interestingly, after ranibizumab came out, there have been two new,

160
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:53,260
very similar anti-VEGF therapies and have come out also kind of in that same ballpark though of cost two to ranibizumab early.

161
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:59,820
So why, why do you think back in 2010 and even today, so many people were using the off label bevacizumab.

162
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:12,020
Compare. I mean, the the the Lucentis, the FDA approved drug, you know, went through all the FDA approvals, etc., etc.

163
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:22,400
Imagine. Put yourself in the shoes of an ophthalmologist. You've got a patient coming in there.

164
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:25,780
They're starting to go blind. You want to give them one of these anti-VEGF therapies?

165
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:41,550
Why would you prescribe one versus the other? So like ease of, like, patient access and like lower like financial barriers for patients.

166
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:49,240
Exactly. And I it and what was happening at the time and it kind of still happens today is people would get bevacizumab because it is cheaper.

167
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:58,590
Now, if you if you're on Medicare, many people are on Medicare Part B, typically you're paying 20% co-pay.

168
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:03,960
Okay. And so if you have a $2,000 a month, these are monthly injections.

169
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:12,990
That's $400 in co-pays every month. So you can imagine if you're in fixed income and actually if especially if you're low income,

170
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:18,030
you probably haven't paid for supplemental Medicare insurance, which would which would pay for some of that co-pay.

171
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:24,090
And so you're you'd be paying $400 a month out-of-pocket for that drug.

172
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:28,860
And again, if you're low income, maybe you're just on Social Security or something like that, you know,

173
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:35,189
your social see, that's eating up, you know, like 20% of your social your income each month or something like that.

174
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:40,920
I mean, that's that's a lot of money. $400 is a lot of money for for someone on a lower fixed income.

175
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:47,490
And and if you're that modest, you you probably don't want to bankrupt your bank or your patients.

176
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:54,210
And also, you know that if if that patient pays the $400 co-pay and realizes that's a lot of money,

177
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,110
they might not come in next month for the next injection. Right.

178
00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:01,770
And so oftentimes, even if you if you're orthodontist and you care nothing about your patient's finances,

179
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:05,760
but you only care about their vision, you still want to give them the low co-pay drug.

180
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:15,209
So they'll come back next month and get another injection. And so you can imagine, you know, $50 a month injection versus 2000 a month injection.

181
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:17,190
It's not just the insurance company paying for it.

182
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:22,000
Oftentimes, especially in these populations, it's the patient actually is paying a significant fraction of that.

183
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:27,060
That is it's a meaningful amount. This isn't a $2 co-pay versus a $4.

184
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:36,210
So an interesting thing, though, is why why might.

185
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:44,170
I actually don't take it as Arsalan Melvin is from South Florida.

186
00:19:46,780 --> 00:20:01,540
He's always a fun one here. Scott here.

187
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:14,250
A pardon, I believe, by Donald Trump. So this is an ophthalmologist in south Florida.

188
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:21,360
He was serving a 17 year sentence for $73 million in Medicare fraud conviction.

189
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:30,750
So what he is was convicted of doing here is he was giving out a lot of these stories.

190
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:35,129
Imagine South Florida to a lot of older individuals, many of whom might face these chronic eye disease,

191
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:47,730
which is very important population to be to be treating. So he was giving out a ton of these ranibizumab injections or Lucentis injections and.

192
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:54,290
He was doing a few things. One of which was he would take the.

193
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:06,330
The vial here and you draw the stuff out of the violent and inject it for the first time and realize, hey, there's a little bit left over in here.

194
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:15,059
So you would you would use, you know, use multiple vials for four patients, which actually I don't think is technically illegal.

195
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:17,760
But that was that was, you know, very concerning.

196
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:30,150
And there was a concern, though, that he was maybe also over billing and inappropriately encouraging patients to get these injections.

197
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:37,540
And part of the challenge, when you ask yourself why, why would someone give all these people these extra injections?

198
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:43,140
Well, Medicare is obligated to pay 106% on the average sales price.

199
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:57,870
And so if you're an ophthalmologist and you have the option to give someone a $2,000 an injection drug or a $50 injection per injection drug,

200
00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:05,800
which one gives you more profit? 6% of 2000.

201
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:10,630
So you get hundreds. And that extra 6% is what you're getting, as is your profit margin here.

202
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:15,510
And 6% of 2000 is much better than 6% at $50 right now.

203
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,950
There are some you talk to acknowledge there are some risks.

204
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:24,970
If you've got a refrigerator full of 2000 hour dose stuff sitting around and then the power goes out or something like that,

205
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:27,639
you risk a lot of wastage and so forth.

206
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:34,300
So you have to you know, that is a concern about having a high priced product just sitting around in your in your refrigerators.

207
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:40,330
But if you're a high volume provider who's providing a ton of these injections, you probably had systems in place to take care of that.

208
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:44,650
Also, if you're a high volume provider, are you paying the average sales price?

209
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:50,960
Well, maybe not. Maybe you worked out a deal where you get this at a discount.

210
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:57,160
So now 106% of $2,000. That gives you a lot.

211
00:22:57,170 --> 00:23:01,860
But then if you're not even paying 2000 hours a dose, maybe you're paying $800 a dose, stuff like that.

212
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:04,280
That's even extra kind of profit margin for you.

213
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:13,450
When when the drug is $50 a dose, there's not much room, wiggle room for that extra margin that you make on selling the the medications here.

214
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:24,890
So anyway, solid margin, making a ton of money off of selling Lucentis here to his to his patients,

215
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:33,410
also really doing very, very sketchy stuff, giving a bunch of money to some senators and stuff like that.

216
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:39,980
But you can imagine, though, there's there's a lot of incentive here with a lot of money going around.

217
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:48,890
And if you're the doctor selling a really expensive medication, that can be a big financial incentive for you to give them a more expensive drug.

218
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:56,930
So we argue that it might be difficult to restrict that 106% reimbursement, but we said, well,

219
00:23:56,930 --> 00:24:03,530
what if maybe so maybe Medicare's not allowed to reduce that reimbursement for ranibizumab,

220
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:09,170
but maybe they could give a bonus to physicians if they prescribed bevacizumab.

221
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:14,470
And we actually looked at this here and said, well,

222
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:24,130
what if you increase the bevacizumab reimbursement up from $50 or so and maybe you could pay doctors,

223
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:32,439
let's say $250 per injection instead and kind of give them extra profit on the bevacizumab, if that.

224
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:39,880
And then we said, well, if you changed behavior, so if you paid doctors $250 for bevacizumab injections and well,

225
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:48,490
maybe that's making 200 here, if you had an 18% reduction in ranibizumab use, then you'd actually be budget neutral.

226
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:54,820
So we were able to look at some kind of interesting policy hypotheticals here.

227
00:24:55,780 --> 00:25:01,420
Of course, if you did bevacizumab, if you increased bevacizumab reimbursement, it didn't change any provider behavior change.

228
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,920
Then, of course, you're you're losing. That's not that's not a winner.

229
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:12,430
But if you can make a slight bump up in bevacizumab reimbursement and have a big jump up in randomized MAB use,

230
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:19,990
you actually might save, you know, billions of dollars over ten years. This is kind of interesting as we were looking at.

231
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:31,030
Yeah. So, you know, there's some, you know, tens of billions of dollars that could be spent on these drugs.

232
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:36,100
Next, I want to share any questions about that.

233
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:42,550
So I think there are just kind of these, you know, tens of billions of dollars problems kind of hiding in different places.

234
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:46,360
I'm sure many of you never heard of Lucentis or Avastin before this.

235
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:52,420
Another one you may have heard about is so of all the years of our school year for the hepatitis A, hepatitis C treatment,

236
00:25:53,290 --> 00:26:01,240
this was much more of a concern, you know, five or ten years ago, less of a concern today because there were new drugs that came on market.

237
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:05,570
I want to walk through some interesting policy challenges people were facing when this came out.

238
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:10,120
So so last year is it was hepatitis C treatment before this.

239
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:13,510
You'd have to take interferons for like six or nine months.

240
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:20,020
It'd be like having flu like symptoms for six or nine months. And then even then, you'd only have a 50% chance of having your Hep C cured.

241
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:25,990
Sebastian, your came out very expensive, but it's $1,000 a pill.

242
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:33,760
$84,000. But it cost effective because it was like 90 something percent effective at getting rid of your hep C,

243
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:38,470
very few side effects and probably over 25 to 50000 hours per body.

244
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:47,170
So if something cost effective, we think it's a good value for money, but it has some interesting kind of budget questions.

245
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:49,780
I want to walk through an example here with the prison system.

246
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:57,280
So at the time, you know, about 2014 or so when this was kind of a new thing, that's still quite expensive and kind of the only game in town.

247
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:06,250
I want to walk through a simple example here. Let's think about the Michigan prison population at the time for 40,000 prisoners.

248
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:13,480
And why are we talking about prisoners? Well, among prison inmates, they have very high prevalence of hepatitis C,

249
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:21,639
anywhere between the CDC estimates between they were treated like ten and 35% of the population in prisons has hepatitis C.

250
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:25,900
This is something where you offense, you know, unsafe injections and things like that.

251
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:28,900
Well, we'll give you hep C and also.

252
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:38,560
Yeah, so it's a it's a big problem there. But again, at the time, treatment was $84,000 per person.

253
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:45,280
Now, if you're, you know, managing in prison or the prison population,

254
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:50,760
you have a legal obligation to take care of the health of the patient population there.

255
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:54,940
It's under your care. But, you know, again, $84,000 per person.

256
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:00,190
It's quite expensive. So let's actually kind of walk through.

257
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:29,290
A very brief example here. So here we have the population, 43,704 prisoners prevalence.

258
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:39,420
Let's be conservative and say maybe 15% prevalence sort of number with hepatitis C.

259
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:47,820
That's just simply 42,000 has 15.

260
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:53,820
So that's 6000 people, prisoners or so with hepatitis Chronic, hepatitis C.

261
00:28:54,390 --> 00:29:03,090
And then we have the treatment cost per person, $84,000.

262
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:13,100
So what would be what would we spend then? If you're in charge of Michigan's prisons,

263
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:28,250
what will your spending be for giving all of these people Hep C treatment that you're well and simply be 6000 people at $84,000,

264
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:36,480
which give us a big number here. $550 million.

265
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:51,560
It's hard to see. So, Chuck, $550 million just on hepatitis C spending.

266
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:59,240
And by the way, that would be one year. And then maybe next year you'd have new patients coming in with chronic hepatitis C or something as well.

267
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:04,700
So the total present prison budget is about $2 billion in time,

268
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:09,110
and state spending on prisoner health care and mental health services was $291 million.

269
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:13,640
So you can imagine if you're in charge of that, can you imagine as a legislator saying, okay,

270
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:19,700
now we've got to treat people with hep C and the prisons are total prison budget is $2 billion.

271
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:23,450
Now we need have another half a billion dollars just for hep C treatment.

272
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:33,890
So, you know, guards and food drive busses around and the state spending for personal prisoner health care and mental health was 291 million.

273
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:41,750
And now all of a sudden you're saying, oh, maybe we need to spend another $500 million on hep C treatment.

274
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:52,010
So that's one of the one of the challenges that we were facing about ten years ago was what to do about this.

275
00:30:54,740 --> 00:31:00,920
Again, very expensive medication and large number of people in the prison system would need it.

276
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:07,100
And so, you know, if you were to immediately treat everyone, you'd spend $5 million.

277
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:11,510
Again, just in that context, this that would be a big, big amount.

278
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:16,600
It's not pocket change. So actually, maybe I'll turn over to you guys.

279
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:21,110
What do you think the state of Michigan should have done at the time,

280
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:25,760
or what would you have done if you were in the Michigan Department of Human

281
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:31,670
Services or Michigan Prison System or Michigan Legislature five or ten years ago?

282
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:38,920
Yeah. So, like, if we're just thinking about the state of Michigan, I guess I'm just wondering,

283
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:47,400
do you know if there was because like people who are in prison aren't eligible for insurance like Medicaid.

284
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:57,570
So could they have like applied for a waiver to get Medicaid to cover this medication to take some of the cost off?

285
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:01,320
And so that's an interesting question.

286
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:04,530
I'm not sure that's a good question potentially.

287
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:15,420
And so what would happen then, I suppose, is so that this this spending goes out of the prison budget, but then into the Medicaid budget,

288
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:21,810
now state Medicaid, typically, roughly, you know, Michigan pays around half and the federal government pays for the other half.

289
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:25,620
So this would cut Michigan spending in half or so.

290
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:30,660
So that would that could potentially substantially reduce the budget for Michigan.

291
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:37,110
Of course, money does come from somewhere. It comes from the whole country that gets sent to the federal government.

292
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:39,300
Yeah, but that's potentially one.

293
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:48,220
One way to reduce that big shock to the Michigan budget and Michigan corrections budget to put it into the Medicaid budget.

294
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:53,950
So that's an interesting approach. I think that's.

295
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:09,240
So imagine you're a state representative or senator and you're in a town hall meeting.

296
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:15,510
You say, Hey, guys, I need you to raise your taxes to pay for hep C treatment for prisoners.

297
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:20,930
How was that going to go over in that townhall or the debates?

298
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:25,849
Well, I'll send out the little fliers to everyone.

299
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:29,390
Mailers. Vote for me. I'm going to spend now.

300
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:35,299
Okay. And also think about this. You know, $550 million going to roughly 10 million people in Michigan.

301
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:43,820
So it's 50 bucks a person saying, hey, everyone can raise your taxes by $50 so we can pay for hep C treatment for prisoners right now.

302
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:49,160
Morally, that's probably right. They do. But it's not a big political.

303
00:33:52,640 --> 00:34:04,280
That's a stigma. So what actually happened with this is and this happened, of course, the prison system, but also in other settings as well.

304
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:09,230
So this is this is, you know, expensive. The good news is it's a one time expense.

305
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:13,280
You pay the money 12 weeks later, you're either cured or not.

306
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,850
And most of the time they're cured, you know, 90 something percent chance that they're cured, too.

307
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:20,120
Theoretically should have paid for this, although actually in the prison system,

308
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:28,580
this population is at high risk for getting reinfected, which means another 84000 hours of treatment, which is which is a challenge.

309
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:34,820
Anyway, what happened in the prison system and a lot of other systems is they kind of tried to wait it out.

310
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:39,650
They said, well, this person's, you know, they're going to be released in a month or two.

311
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:45,140
We'll just not treat them and hope that that won't be a problem once they're released.

312
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:54,440
Also, the hepatitis C, there is kind of a continuum of how bad your hepatitis C is, how scarred your liver is.

313
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,960
And basically they said, well,

314
00:34:57,170 --> 00:35:03,200
we're not going to give it to people with kind of mild versions of this growing in people in the in the later stages of hep C.

315
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:10,850
So they triage it and again, only give the treatment to people with the later worse forms of hep C,

316
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,209
which in some ways, I mean, if you're going to give the treatment to anyone,

317
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:21,710
that's probably the best population to give it to because there are the most risk of severe outcomes because their liver so damaged.

318
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:27,350
And so that was that was their way of kind of rationing the treatment so that.

319
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:34,760
So this big amount here instead of giving it all 6000 people would have C maybe don't they give it to 600 people with hep C and so that,

320
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:39,720
you know, reduces this spending from 550 million down to 50 million or something.

321
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:44,480
So now that's the right approach.

322
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:51,650
But that's approach that prison systems took is they would really try to severely restrict who actually would get this.

323
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:59,540
Well, you have to have the really worst the worst form of the liver disease in order for us to actually make eligible for this.

324
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:05,990
Or if you're and you have to have more than a year or two on your sentence or something like that, we're going to be there for a long period of time.

325
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:10,490
But also, you would you would see this in private health insurance plans as well.

326
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:11,750
They did something similar.

327
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:19,850
They they would say, well, we're only going to give this to you if you have a fibrosis score of three or four or five or whatever it was,

328
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:25,879
the people with the most severe forms of the disease and and in some ways they were kind of waiting it out over time.

329
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:34,580
Some competitors came into the market. And so there was you had more choices and just so all the rest of us were there.

330
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,410
And so the price has dropped dramatically. It's, you know, 187.

331
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:47,790
Well, anyone know which country on the planet has the highest prevalence of hepatitis C?

332
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:53,360
So Egypt. Egypt has the highest prevalence of hepatitis C.

333
00:36:55,100 --> 00:37:04,129
It's between five and 10% of the population as chronic hepatitis C now because there are really high risk population or something like that.

334
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:08,630
But apparently, again, like the 1960s or something like that,

335
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:14,209
they were doing some vaccination campaigns for some other disease, just biases or something like that.

336
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:19,060
So workers would come around, they'd say, okay, I'm going to give you this injection and give you this injection.

337
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:23,760
And you say, We don't give you this injection and these and and yeah, so have this.

338
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:34,310
Egypt has really high prevalence of hep C who here thinks drug companies are bad and what not so the the makers of civil

339
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:42,740
the use of us for beer so 3 to $4000 a pill in the United States they said look we know Egypt is a big problem in Egypt,

340
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:48,620
$1 a day. They saw the pills for $1 a day, $1 killed in Egypt.

341
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:57,049
So yeah so you might think big that drug companies but they I mean maybe you know they weren't they felt they weren't those that much market share

342
00:37:57,050 --> 00:38:06,020
by selling these pills to Egypt but they sold again $1 a day something because they're so clearly the manufacturing cost isn't that high for this.

343
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:12,800
They're they're recouping their investment in the United States and then, you know, selling it for low price in Egypt.

344
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:21,380
Okay. Any other questions or comments about Hep C?

345
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:28,630
See you next time when I talk about immunity.

346
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:35,230
Immunotherapy is an exciting area of cancer research since I knew this about cancer treatment.

347
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:41,080
Immunotherapy works by using the body's immune system to fight cancer.

348
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:48,190
The immune system is a complex network of organs, tissues and cells and the substances they make.

349
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:55,660
Immunotherapy uses different ways to boost the immune system to do a better job of killing cancer cells.

350
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:03,070
This video describes one type of immunotherapy that uses immune checkpoint inhibitors to treat cancer.

351
00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:09,940
T cells are a type of immune cell and are powerful weapons the immune system uses to fight cancer.

352
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:14,830
Immune checkpoints on cell surfaces help control an immune response.

353
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:18,400
Usually the immune checkpoints keep t cells inactive.

354
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:24,070
That is in an open state until they're needed. This keeps the T cells from harming normal cells.

355
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:28,900
Cancer cells can take advantage of these checkpoints to switch T cells off.

356
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:35,560
This keeps the cancer cells from being killed, immune checkpoint inhibitors or drugs that block the checkpoint.

357
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:44,290
This frees the T cells to attack the cancer. Immune checkpoint inhibitors are an effective way to treat some types of cancer,

358
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:48,820
but they don't work for every patient and can cause serious side effects.

359
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:57,540
To learn more about immunotherapy, visit cancer, dark sludge therapy or so immune checkpoint inhibitors.

360
00:39:57,550 --> 00:40:08,680
Kind of a unique novel, a newish approach to addressing certain types of cancers, and that it's a really great idea.

361
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:13,209
Hey, why don't we use the body's natural immune system to kill cancer cells?

362
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:19,150
And so this is a relatively new approach to to get treatment.

363
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:25,000
But I suppose, as you can imagine, if your immune system starts healthy cells, that's not good.

364
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,299
But you want it to to block this.

365
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:31,390
And one example is this PD one inhibitor here.

366
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:37,030
So we know kind of block that kind of checkpoint and then allow the T cells to

367
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:43,270
kind of attack these cancer cells of a lot of different types of inhibitors here.

368
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:48,940
Here are some ones you may have heard about, PD-L1 PD, one inhibitor PD.

369
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:56,679
I want to hear some SEO inhibitors and so forth. You may have seen commercials actually.

370
00:40:56,680 --> 00:41:15,940
Let me look and see if I can find. Four adults with advanced non-small cell lung cancer, previously treated with platinum based chemotherapy,

371
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:22,240
including those with abnormal ALT or EGFR gene who tried an FDA approved targeted therapy.

372
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:28,180
This is being a chance to live longer without development.

373
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:35,250
Development of TiVo demonstrated longer life and is the most prescribed to an entire thing there.

374
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:39,760
But notice that the language there a chance to live longer.

375
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:45,970
Okay. So that's that's what's there. There is a new novel treatment here.

376
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:53,440
And the idea here is that these kind of medications can treat a lot of different types of cancers.

377
00:41:55,740 --> 00:42:00,930
And so here are a few examples of some some results from a clinical trial.

378
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:05,190
This one is is that that drug Opdivo nivolumab.

379
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:14,970
Here to more know all about versus Dr. Taxol and of standard chemotherapy here for advanced squamous cell non-small cell lung cancer here.

380
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:19,350
And we've got a couple different lines here.

381
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:23,010
This is overall survival, this time in months.

382
00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:28,790
So which one is better? At these survival curves.

383
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:33,700
If you care about living longer, which ones are better? Treat.

384
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:42,560
Reported that all that the blue line, the lines better might have higher survival over time.

385
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:49,460
That's pretty good, right? We want to if we want to live longer. So you want your higher line here is better over time.

386
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:59,600
Now, how much better is it, though? Look at it have survival rate.

387
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:03,950
Yeah. So one way of looking at it. It's kind of vertical distance here.

388
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:18,410
And so you can say, okay, at 12 months, 42% of the people in the nivolumab arm were alive and 24% in the dose of Taxol group were alive.

389
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:22,279
So that's that's actually pretty good, right? That's a that's a meaningful difference.

390
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:29,300
You don't have to go through a microscope or your your magnifying glass to see the difference between these two lines.

391
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:38,670
That's a meaningful difference there between the two lines. 42% chance of being alive in a year is much greater than 24% chance of being alive.

392
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:45,390
Now, by the way, these things are higher in advanced cancers, which, again, it's these are pretty serious to start with.

393
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:58,000
This is a really low risk cancer. And so now keep in mind here, too, though, this is not a silver bullet.

394
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:01,120
This is not 100% survival versus 20% of central.

395
00:44:01,150 --> 00:44:04,510
This is 42% survival versus 24% survival.

396
00:44:04,990 --> 00:44:10,719
So this is not some sort of, you know, as as as nice as the music was and, you know,

397
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:16,030
soft focus and and and beautiful vacation that this should be on or whatever.

398
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:23,740
This is not 100% survival either. It's 40, 42% survival at one year and even at two years, 24.

399
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:29,620
Right. Maybe 30% survival or something. So this is not a silver bullet that magically cures cancer.

400
00:44:30,070 --> 00:44:36,370
Okay. And by the way, so this is this is published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2015.

401
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:41,380
And I have a similar graph here. Also overall survival.

402
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:47,660
And I actually was looking through my notes. I'm like, What is the difference between these two?

403
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:53,990
So here's another graph also for advanced non-small cell lung cancer.

404
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:58,340
Here in 12 months, it's 51% versus 39%.

405
00:44:59,270 --> 00:45:05,060
And actually, in a year sorry, two years, it's again, maybe 30% versus 15% or something like that.

406
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:08,730
But there isn't actually a difference between these. There's actually two different papers.

407
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:13,960
One is squamous cell non-small cell lung cancer, the other non-squamous, not so small cell lung cancer.

408
00:45:13,970 --> 00:45:18,240
So no different types of cancers might have different side effects either.

409
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:22,640
Either type here, though, none of these things are our silver bullets, right?

410
00:45:22,670 --> 00:45:27,170
This is not a magical here, too. Cancer is definitely has an improvement.

411
00:45:27,170 --> 00:45:31,880
We can definitely see the improvement. This is this is why this is an outcome we care about.

412
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:37,940
This is overall survival. This isn't progression free survival. This is actually being alive versus being dead.

413
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:43,490
So this is and again, these are meaningful differences that people would share.

414
00:45:45,470 --> 00:45:49,820
But this is in the past, there's always a fight.

415
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:54,530
So you give three milligrams per kilogram every two weeks.

416
00:45:57,130 --> 00:46:04,690
Average patient is, let's say 75 kilograms or so, so it's 225 milligrams every two weeks.

417
00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:11,830
The cost here is 26 or $22 per 100 milligrams or about $6,000 every two weeks.

418
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:17,590
So it's about $12,000 a month or $20,000 a year.

419
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:22,080
Now, not everyone is living an entire year to get a whole year's worth of this.

420
00:46:22,090 --> 00:46:32,110
But again, that is, you know, $6,000 a month or sorry, $600 after every two weeks or so is a fair amount of money as well.

421
00:46:32,770 --> 00:46:36,760
So this is, as they say in the commercial, a chance to live longer.

422
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:45,250
But you're paying, you know, $3,000 a week, $12,000 a month or so for that.

423
00:46:46,490 --> 00:46:50,560
Well. So this is this is a challenge here. These these new.

424
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:55,140
These new checkpoint inhibitors.

425
00:46:55,440 --> 00:47:04,110
Again, very innovative and they actually do provide a better outcomes here on something we care about overall survival.

426
00:47:04,470 --> 00:47:06,420
This is and this is a noticeable difference.

427
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:14,460
This isn't something we're again, we have to bring on your microscope to see the differences between the two lines, but also can be quite expensive.

428
00:47:14,550 --> 00:47:17,010
And this is just one example of these kind of checkpoint inhibitors.

429
00:47:17,310 --> 00:47:25,620
There are a ton of other cancer medications that are very, very high cost and might not even show this big of kind of differences.

430
00:47:27,090 --> 00:47:34,230
But that's that is a challenge, is that there are a lot of new cancer medications out there that are quite,

431
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:45,809
quite innovative, but also quite expensive. Just kind of back of the envelope if this costs that amount when you when you think it's going to be

432
00:47:45,810 --> 00:47:50,670
cost effective or how would you just at a high level think about how cost effective this treatment.

433
00:47:53,840 --> 00:48:08,870
Just knowing that you seen so far. Is it likely to be cost effective if not cost effective?

434
00:48:10,230 --> 00:48:17,400
I think cost effective. So why would it be cost effective? Because just like from the raw data, there's at least like.

435
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:26,520
A large percentage difference and like at least in a year's time frame between the between the other drug.

436
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:33,450
So you'd have a chance of. So we're saying, you know, like cost and effectiveness.

437
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:41,490
And if you have docetaxel, the standard of care here, you're saying nivolumab or octavo.

438
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:45,810
It definitely is better. Right. So it's going to be better on and in fact, factor is probably more expensive.

439
00:48:45,810 --> 00:48:54,900
Go to as we said here. So I mean, people are living and if people are living, then that have a higher chance of qualities than being dead.

440
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:58,080
So. Exactly. Yeah. And so I agree with you.

441
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:02,150
I think if we're comparing to docetaxel, nivolumab, your Opdivo, it.

442
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:07,620
Yeah, I mean, probably it does have some additional side effects, but you are alive longer.

443
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:12,930
And so and this is, you know, meaningful increase in life expectancy here.

444
00:49:13,230 --> 00:49:16,920
So you're probably here increased effectiveness, increased costs.

445
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:21,690
So the good news is we're probably not down here dominated and we're probably not out here

446
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:28,380
where know higher cost and or dominant or dominated or probably not down here either.

447
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:36,330
So we think we're having better effectiveness. So think about our in this in this upper quadrant here.

448
00:49:42,350 --> 00:49:47,750
You know, though, roughly speaking, how cost effective do you think it might be if it's in that order?

449
00:49:52,310 --> 00:49:56,690
Is it $10 equality? $100,000 equality?

450
00:49:57,620 --> 00:50:02,930
$10,100 million probably. Yeah.

451
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:07,920
It will be very expensive because patient leave very short.

452
00:50:08,250 --> 00:50:12,990
It's in their late stage. Yeah. So there are a few things going on here, right.

453
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:20,460
The the benefit to patients in terms of life expectancy is basically the area between these curves.

454
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:28,320
That's the benefit in life expectancy. So first of all, you have to think about, you know, how big is that area?

455
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:34,020
And again, this is this is kind of one year. This is two years.

456
00:50:36,510 --> 00:50:46,229
So this area between these two lines in the first years, maybe I don't eyeball it like point one or something like that.

457
00:50:46,230 --> 00:50:53,720
And this is maybe point to. So we have kind of a small smallish benefit, at least in the first couple of years of life expectancy.

458
00:50:53,730 --> 00:50:57,450
Now, if these people who are alive at 24 months,

459
00:50:57,750 --> 00:51:06,630
if they have if they have infinite life expectancy after that, then maybe maybe you would have more quality.

460
00:51:06,870 --> 00:51:10,860
But you point out another thing, too. These are people with advanced cancer.

461
00:51:11,550 --> 00:51:18,330
These aren't, you know, 18 year olds who are full, healthy and otherwise might drop dead.

462
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:23,970
These are people with advanced cancer who probably have diminished quality of life as well.

463
00:51:24,390 --> 00:51:27,510
So not only is it life expectancy, but it's quality adjusted life expectancy.

464
00:51:27,510 --> 00:51:39,120
If someone has this condition, they might not be, you know, walking around the streets, enjoying a nice day outside.

465
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:47,880
Right. They might be bedridden or something like that. So again, this is might not have perfect quality of life.

466
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:57,410
And so that. So the the gains and qualities here.

467
00:51:57,770 --> 00:52:07,010
I mean, let's let's say let's say that you do gain a point to call these for every year, for every additional year.

468
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:20,030
Right. Yeah. So it's. It's not a giant increase in in quality adjusted life expectancy.

469
00:52:21,230 --> 00:52:27,740
And then what's the. So let's say someone does. Let's let's look at the extreme case here.

470
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:34,490
What if. When Pop Diva was here.

471
00:52:35,870 --> 00:52:48,210
And. What is? Never all the docetaxel was here if your survival curves look like this.

472
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,660
So if you give them an octavo, they and let's say quality of life is perfect.

473
00:52:56,600 --> 00:53:00,470
So every year they took up TiVo. They got one quality.

474
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:08,210
If the survival curves were were exactly like this, you gain one quality for every year of their lives.

475
00:53:09,230 --> 00:53:11,960
But how much are you paying for each year? Their lives?

476
00:53:27,050 --> 00:53:32,930
If you're paying about $6,000 every two weeks, you're paying by $12,000 every four weeks or every month.

477
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:42,200
And so that would be, you know, $144,000 per year, let's say, here.

478
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:51,990
So even if it were perfect to keeping you alive and you're all the alternative was you immediately die.

479
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:56,010
It would be about and your and your quality of life is perfect health.

480
00:53:56,370 --> 00:54:05,400
It'd be $144,000 per person. But it doesn't give you perfect health and it doesn't completely eliminate your risk of dying.

481
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:12,240
And so, yes, the cost factor ratio is likely, you know, many, many hundreds of thousands of dollars,

482
00:54:12,630 --> 00:54:19,090
if not millions of dollars per following are most insurance companies are covering up objetivo?

483
00:54:19,170 --> 00:54:29,220
Yes. Yeah. And that is an interesting point here, is oftentimes, yeah, the insurance companies are paying for these really high cost medications.

484
00:54:30,910 --> 00:54:39,150
Now I will say this is the list price. It is possible insurers will get a discount if they negotiate or something.

485
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:44,950
Then how much is a loss of tax? Oh, that's pretty cheap, I think.

486
00:54:45,170 --> 00:54:53,649
I mean. Well, it's certainly. It's not free. Yeah. But, you know, I would guess, you know, under $500 a month.

487
00:54:53,650 --> 00:55:03,030
That's okay. But yeah, that's a good question about the Internet.

488
00:55:03,450 --> 00:55:11,379
Yeah. Yeah. So it's worth mentioning there are a lot of high cost cancer medications and it is challenging to find them cost effective,

489
00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:18,700
even if they have a, you know, have a noticeable increase in life expectancy.

490
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:22,450
Again, oftentimes these medications are thousands of dollars a month.

491
00:55:22,930 --> 00:55:28,180
And it's it is challenging to justify the amount of cost effective grounds, cost effective sprouts.

492
00:55:32,740 --> 00:55:38,950
And then, you know, one of the other things we we talked about,

493
00:55:38,950 --> 00:55:50,700
I think something we talked about earlier is Nusinersen and Spinraza or Zolgensma is Zolgensma.

494
00:55:50,710 --> 00:55:56,680
Was that really high cost, $2 million gene therapy?

495
00:55:57,790 --> 00:56:01,359
And then there's another drug this looks turn out for some eye diseases.

496
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:04,450
One of the reasons you had for today was talking about, you know,

497
00:56:04,450 --> 00:56:08,890
how are insurers going to be thinking about paying for some of these high cost medications, gene therapies?

498
00:56:09,250 --> 00:56:15,880
So we talk about the high cost cancer medications. Also, high cost gene therapies are another another area where things are quite expensive.

499
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:26,890
Again, Zolgensma, I think we talked about this earlier in this semester is that high cost, $2 million gene therapy for spinal muscular atrophy.

500
00:56:27,730 --> 00:56:36,550
But when we compare it to the alternative here, spinraza this $100,000 injection into the spine, it's happening many times a year.

501
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:42,550
It actually might look more cost effective compared to that. But either way, though, these are expensive and expensive.

502
00:56:44,210 --> 00:56:47,090
Treatments. And one of the articles you read said Cigna,

503
00:56:47,090 --> 00:56:55,340
another payer was going to add just to pay for these gene therapies within at a cost of a dollar per member per month to do this.

504
00:56:55,370 --> 00:57:00,529
And so again, I want to highlight that these high cost medications, in the end, someone has to pay for them.

505
00:57:00,530 --> 00:57:03,469
They don't come for free and typically that person has to pay for them.

506
00:57:03,470 --> 00:57:09,260
Is, is you or the kind of general population in terms of higher insurance premiums or higher taxes.

507
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:17,340
So one of the ways that CVS was planning on addressing this was, you know,

508
00:57:17,810 --> 00:57:25,010
put out in a paper from four years ago about their current and approved and new approaches to making drugs more affordable.

509
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:31,040
And so, you know, a few things that they suggest for ways to keep drug prices under control were

510
00:57:31,250 --> 00:57:35,810
encouraging the use of lower cost alternatives like generics or through step therapy.

511
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:41,479
So step therapy might be we're going to give you bevacizumab. And if that doesn't work, then we'll let you get ranibizumab.

512
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:49,670
The other eye injection. I'll use prior authorization rules and obtain lower costs by using competition.

513
00:57:49,910 --> 00:57:54,050
Basically negotiate lower prices with drug drug makers.

514
00:57:54,320 --> 00:58:01,550
They say, however, more needs to be done. This kind of stuff is insufficient to bring drug prices under control.

515
00:58:03,020 --> 00:58:10,730
There are three interventions they talked about were zero out-of-pocket costs for chronic diseases, maybe for that before.

516
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:23,020
I would say the previous example, the one to start, right. The first example used.

517
00:58:23,020 --> 00:58:27,219
Is that the one you're referring to. Yeah. Well, yeah. So so you could Yeah.

518
00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:30,610
Say bevacizumab, you know, reduce the out-of-pocket costs.

519
00:58:31,030 --> 00:58:37,330
But what, where have you ever heard about just kind of in general about reducing out-of-pocket costs for chronic disease management?

520
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:47,500
Oh, yeah. So Obamacare or the Affordable Care Act, that was one place where, yeah,

521
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:52,930
they they wanted to reduce the out-of-pocket costs for for chronic disease management.

522
00:58:53,140 --> 00:58:56,700
And also, hopefully with when Mark Hendrickson came here to talk about things,

523
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:59,170
I think that's one of the things he was talking about, carrots and sticks.

524
00:58:59,170 --> 00:59:05,080
And and one of the things is, you know, should we charge co-pays for insulin?

525
00:59:06,070 --> 00:59:15,580
Probably not. Right. I mean, that's that's a really, really valuable medication for people with with and or severe forms of diabetes.

526
00:59:15,850 --> 00:59:20,410
And so you want to make sure people take their insulin and you don't want a Coke to be a barrier.

527
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:28,089
So that's one thing here. But I think the key thing here for us today is reducing launch price.

528
00:59:28,090 --> 00:59:34,809
Using comparative factors is one of the things they highlight today in their white paper in 2018.

529
00:59:34,810 --> 00:59:38,230
They talk about, you know, high launch prices.

530
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:43,170
For some of these specialty drugs over time.

531
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:48,030
And, you know, back in the 1990s, you know, the latest drug that it was really expensive.

532
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:52,380
You know, we have, you know, a $10,000 annual price or something.

533
00:59:52,770 --> 01:00:04,150
Whereas, you know, more recent things when they were launched, um, were launched and, you know, Harvoni here is this hep C Medicine Center.

534
01:00:04,170 --> 01:00:09,360
So all the area, so these are really $80,000 a year or so.

535
01:00:09,690 --> 01:00:14,400
So these other things are, you know, $200,000 a year. So they say, hey, this is really expensive.

536
01:00:16,230 --> 01:00:17,219
And so as I see this,

537
01:00:17,220 --> 01:00:24,480
Caremark is initiating a program that allows clients to exclude any drug launched in a price of greater than $100,000 per policy from their plan.

538
01:00:27,870 --> 01:00:30,960
So CBS actually did create a special buy now.

539
01:00:31,050 --> 01:00:40,230
It wasn't done for everyone. But they say, look, if you're an employer, we will offer you a special plan where you can exclude drivers with a really,

540
01:00:40,230 --> 01:00:43,820
really expensive, you know, cost or value for money to the cost per point.

541
01:00:45,270 --> 01:00:55,800
And then they and then they say this is based on data from this Institute for Clinical and Economic Review or ICER, which we talked about earlier.

542
01:00:56,220 --> 01:01:02,510
True. And really what I think also it's intriguing on this quote here,

543
01:01:02,870 --> 01:01:08,810
they say no wonder manufacturers have until now had any control over launch price with patent drugs.

544
01:01:09,890 --> 01:01:15,800
And so, you know, this is really I think also there you think about this as a tool for price negotiation

545
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:20,300
rather than just accepting whatever price the manufacturers are putting out there,

546
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:25,670
they're saying, look, we're going to, you know, exclude drugs that cost more than $100,000, probably.

547
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:33,830
And presumably then if a manufacturer wants to be included on the formulary, then they have to reduce their price to meet that threshold.

548
01:01:35,550 --> 01:01:41,040
So this is someone who got her in really innovative plan from four years ago,

549
01:01:42,090 --> 01:01:59,370
from CVS for these drugs and was designed to allow the clients here probably employer plans to restrict medications based on cost effectiveness.

550
01:01:59,370 --> 01:02:04,260
And this is something, you know, again, we really don't do in the U.S. So that's just kind of interesting and unique here.

551
01:02:06,420 --> 01:02:15,330
But then, of course, the article you read in 2019, the title here is CVS Drug Coverage Plan based on outside primary review is off to a slow start.

552
01:02:16,230 --> 01:02:24,060
So why do you think that is? So they offered this plan, hey, we're going to allow you to exclude drugs that are not cost effective.

553
01:02:26,110 --> 01:02:29,410
And then they basically stopped marketing this this new plan.

554
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:34,380
Why do you think? You're reading that? Why why was that the case?

555
01:02:34,950 --> 01:02:40,860
Why wasn't there more uptake of this? I mean, here in this class, we've been talking cost effectiveness, cost effective.

556
01:02:40,870 --> 01:02:45,330
So great, so great, so great. But I mean, here it is.

557
01:02:45,890 --> 01:02:49,440
You know, you know, CBS saying, hey, we're going to offer this plan.

558
01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:57,480
And then they kind of said, well, maybe we want to offer it, but we're not going to be marketed and there's just too much uptake of it.

559
01:02:58,050 --> 01:03:05,680
Why is that? Because the pharma companies don't like it.

560
01:03:07,190 --> 01:03:10,930
Some companies don't like it. You're right. And again, that is I mean.

561
01:03:10,940 --> 01:03:16,130
Right. It's probably because CBS is going to use that to negotiate for lower drug prices.

562
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:23,300
So how did pharma express express their displeasure with this plan?

563
01:03:28,390 --> 01:03:33,160
Right. They're not going to abide by the rules.

564
01:03:33,350 --> 01:03:37,510
He's excluded. How would they not abide by the rules?

565
01:03:38,260 --> 01:03:44,840
By not trying to reduce their costs. So it's possible they would say, oh, you don't want to pay for a drug.

566
01:03:44,890 --> 01:03:48,370
Fine, you don't pay for a drug. We're still going to keep the high price. That could be one way.

567
01:03:52,040 --> 01:04:02,220
Anything else? They increased the other drugs price to make their profit so well.

568
01:04:02,250 --> 01:04:08,160
So one potential thing they could do is if they have another drug that has a cost effective ratio of $50,000 for quality,

569
01:04:08,460 --> 01:04:11,700
they could increase the price. It would be right up to $100,000 per bottle.

570
01:04:11,850 --> 01:04:15,330
And then they kind of make up the margins maybe that way.

571
01:04:16,050 --> 01:04:24,960
Now, that's one potential approach, although presumably there is a reason that that other drug has a price that makes it $50,000 per bottle.

572
01:04:25,140 --> 01:04:29,310
And then in that, if they increase the price, maybe people would switch to a different drug.

573
01:04:29,430 --> 01:04:36,150
So there might not be much cut, but there might be more competition for some of those those drugs that have more cost effectiveness ratios.

574
01:04:51,190 --> 01:04:52,690
So in the first paragraph here.

575
01:04:57,740 --> 01:05:05,510
It's gained little traction with customers, according to Tottenham executive, and has drawn fierce criticism from patient advocacy groups.

576
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:19,450
So who's going to complain if you have a really expensive drug for a spinal muscular atrophy or for non-small cell lung cancer,

577
01:05:20,620 --> 01:05:24,760
which advocates for spinal muscular atrophy and non-small cell lung cancer?

578
01:05:32,900 --> 01:05:34,010
And also it had a law.

579
01:05:34,010 --> 01:05:42,319
And so so, you know, drug companies, you know, we're not happy about this and wrote op eds and things like that about retailers,

580
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:45,950
about why they thought it was not a good, good idea.

581
01:05:46,970 --> 01:05:54,500
And you hear this, too. The analysis is based on additional years of quality of life gained from a given treatment, and they say it's arbitrary.

582
01:05:55,820 --> 01:06:02,720
And also, more importantly, from their perspective, it disregards the costs of drug development and patient needs.

583
01:06:03,830 --> 01:06:09,620
And it does right. It disregards the cost of how much you know, oh, you spent $100 billion developing this drug.

584
01:06:09,890 --> 01:06:15,860
I don't care that that's a sunk cost. And from a cost perspective, they're not going to worry about that.

585
01:06:16,070 --> 01:06:17,690
It will cost you $10. It doesn't matter.

586
01:06:18,110 --> 01:06:22,910
All we care about is, you know, what's the additional value this drug provides and what's the additional cost it provides.

587
01:06:25,550 --> 01:06:31,010
And so pharma here is the pharmaceutical industries and main lobbying group.

588
01:06:31,010 --> 01:06:35,940
They were not happy with this either and criticized it fully.

589
01:06:36,050 --> 01:06:40,880
So since then, this icer group and super clinical economic review,

590
01:06:41,300 --> 01:06:46,010
they not only look at things in terms of dollars properly, but also look at things in terms of dollars per life.

591
01:06:46,010 --> 01:06:52,640
You're to kind of avoid the criticism that they're looking at things in terms of quality or quality of life.

592
01:06:53,570 --> 01:07:07,520
What's one other thing you notice here in this paragraph? That last clause in the first sentence.

593
01:07:12,540 --> 01:07:16,660
Many of which receive funding from the pharmaceutical. Yes. Yes.

594
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:21,409
So the Spinal Muscular Atrophy patient advocacy organization, interestingly,

595
01:07:21,410 --> 01:07:27,270
it probably provides it is provided funding from the manufacturer of these spinal muscular atrophy

596
01:07:27,300 --> 01:07:34,560
treatment or that the cancer advocate group gets some money from the manufacturers of those applications.

597
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:38,540
So it is a little bit murky about, you know,

598
01:07:39,330 --> 01:07:52,080
how much of this is real customer concern and how much of it is its end run around that by the manufacturers now.

599
01:07:52,140 --> 01:07:56,770
So so that's, you know, just yet another kind of concern again in this class.

600
01:07:56,910 --> 01:08:01,980
You know, I think the crossword puzzles can be valuable. I've seen experiences where it can be legal and policy making.

601
01:08:02,580 --> 01:08:05,910
But I want to highlight here that even with really expensive medications,

602
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:11,160
there can be a lot of challenges with using cost effectiveness to decide how we want to

603
01:08:11,580 --> 01:08:15,180
pay for these and also using cost proposals and kind of negotiating for lower prices.

604
01:08:17,340 --> 01:08:22,160
Just to wrap up here today, I want to mention one thing you're having.

605
01:08:22,170 --> 01:08:28,700
Think about one other thing, too. Which rectangle has the larger area, the yellow one or the blue one with blue one going?

606
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:32,870
Well, I mean, depends on how we're looking at the graph per se, but I'd say like the blue.

607
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:38,220
So it might be the blue on here actually. And maybe one way to ramasamy rectangles here.

608
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:42,980
Well, one thing to think about here is we've been talking a lot about high cost medications today.

609
01:08:43,020 --> 01:08:43,950
So you know what?

610
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:50,940
Well, yeah, cost per person is the high cost medication, but your total spending is going to be the population size times the cost per person.

611
01:08:51,030 --> 01:08:57,990
So the total area in here is really the kind of total cost or maybe even the total benefit you can think about that is benefit per person,

612
01:08:58,030 --> 01:09:03,810
population size. That's the area here is going to be a function of price per person, but also the population size.

613
01:09:04,170 --> 01:09:09,899
And today, we've been talking a lot about high cost medications, but you could have something also.

614
01:09:09,900 --> 01:09:14,729
This is a big budget buster that might have a small cost per person, but it's affects a large population.

615
01:09:14,730 --> 01:09:18,840
Also could be a big budget buster as well or something that with a lot of benefit as well.

616
01:09:19,410 --> 01:09:27,930
And so oftentimes I will say we in this class, we had a dog on the medical interventions that really high cost per person.

617
01:09:29,010 --> 01:09:34,380
Oh, it's really high cost medication for spinal muscular atrophy. This really high cost medication for a rare cancer.

618
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:40,920
Yes, those are high costs. But if it's a small population, maybe the total budget impact is not so great.

619
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:47,550
Now, keep in mind, we're all public health people where the pure, pure of heart, we all have halos over our heads and angel wings.

620
01:09:47,910 --> 01:09:54,600
We're public health people. All we care about is, is that large populations and our cost per person for these interventions,

621
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:57,719
like vaccination and so forth, oftentimes are very small. We're all we're going to do.

622
01:09:57,720 --> 01:10:00,240
Patient education's really cheap, it's very inexpensive.

623
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:05,910
But if you're talking about something for a large population, it actually could be expensive as well.

624
01:10:06,210 --> 01:10:10,380
So keep in mind that, you know, we're not necessarily all angels are saints here in public health.

625
01:10:11,010 --> 01:10:16,319
If we it's something we advocate for also could be really expensive.

626
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:22,590
Also could have really big benefits as well. But we're talking about something for if we're talking about something for a large population,

627
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:26,309
even if it's a small cost, it could be something very expensive.

628
01:10:26,310 --> 01:10:33,960
So we say, hey, everyone should get a 17th coronavirus booster or something like that if we were able to get that for everyone.

629
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:38,670
And oh yeah, the booster is not that expensive. But, but if you apply it to a large population,

630
01:10:38,670 --> 01:10:45,060
it might be more impactful or more wasteful than something that's really high cost per person, but affects a very small population size.

631
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:51,920
So just think about that. I mean, we in this class, again, we talk a lot about these high cosmetic medical interventions.

632
01:10:52,580 --> 01:10:55,280
They're very visible because of those high cost. We a lot of press.

633
01:10:56,120 --> 01:11:01,100
But keep in mind, I think cost effective analysis is also valuable for the other types of interventions here.

634
01:11:01,460 --> 01:11:07,190
We're talking about large populations. It might be low cost, but large populations, it is a big impact.

635
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:15,200
And I will say it is a concern for payers as well when you're saying, hey, just give everyone this was really small cost.

636
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:18,379
When you talk about getting it for everyone, that could be a really big expense.

637
01:11:18,380 --> 01:11:23,770
And if if you can't justify it in terms of cost factors, it is it can be challenging to get payers behind that.

638
01:11:26,670 --> 01:11:32,220
So last few minutes, just any general thoughts here? What should we do about high cost, high benefit therapies?

639
01:11:33,830 --> 01:11:43,050
And will restricting payments affect innovation? You smart guys here in this class?

640
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:55,380
I know. I saw a lot of your transcripts when I. When you say restricting payments, is that for patients?

641
01:11:55,410 --> 01:11:56,130
Is that what you're saying?

642
01:11:56,640 --> 01:12:06,719
So let's say we receive payments and say, okay, you know, Roche, we're only going to pay $500 for a drug instead of 2000 and now say,

643
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:11,040
hey, we're we're we're going to negotiate lower prices and maybe it's Medicare, too.

644
01:12:11,550 --> 01:12:17,280
The Senate is going to talk about doing that as well, is saying, hey, we're going to pay lower prices for this.

645
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:22,739
And actually, pharma pharma foundation might say, hey, look, I know you think that sounds great,

646
01:12:22,740 --> 01:12:28,980
but if you restrict their payments to us, that's going to be less motivation for us to develop the next generation of drugs.

647
01:12:29,220 --> 01:12:33,030
And actually, the people working in our companies would love to develop the next generation of drugs,

648
01:12:33,570 --> 01:12:36,780
but we can't get capital from Wall Street if we're not profitable.

649
01:12:37,140 --> 01:12:42,570
Right. And so we won't have the capital to hire more scientists and stuff to do all this stuff because we don't have the profit margins.

650
01:12:42,570 --> 01:12:49,170
And Wall Street's not going to give us money to expand and hire more people and buy more microscopes and whatever it is, you know.

651
01:12:49,170 --> 01:12:52,440
So we need high profits in order to do great things.

652
01:12:52,770 --> 01:12:56,760
And if you restrict payments to us, that's going to restrict our profits and that's going to hurt innovation.

653
01:12:57,300 --> 01:13:07,050
Yeah, but I think like you mentioned earlier, though, like a lot of those a lot of the capital that they that they gain that these are

654
01:13:07,050 --> 01:13:11,490
companies gains is recouped within the US market as compared to other markets.

655
01:13:12,030 --> 01:13:22,290
So maybe it's just like a US kind of centric thing in regards to like these just high, high costs.

656
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:30,450
Well, yeah. So I think I will agree with you that the US does subsidize a lot of innovation and the US pays high prices,

657
01:13:30,450 --> 01:13:35,370
higher prices in general than many other countries. Well, although from an equity perspective,

658
01:13:35,370 --> 01:13:39,750
I think a lot of people would argue and maybe the US should pay more than, you know, Egypt or somewhere else.

659
01:13:40,570 --> 01:13:46,600
Right. But that's that's hard to say when you're the tax payers or, you know,

660
01:13:46,650 --> 01:13:51,360
paying for them or the people paying the insurance premiums and you're paying, you know,

661
01:13:51,420 --> 01:14:01,200
thousands of dollars a month for your insurance premiums or your employer is less excited about hiring

662
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:06,479
you when they know they have to pay insurance for you and they're paying $1,000 a month in that cost.

663
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:08,370
And that's that's, you know, money. You know,

664
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:14,330
an economist argue that's money you don't have in your paycheck because the employer has to pay $1,000 a month or whatever for your health insurance.

665
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:18,840
But anyway. So what do you think?

666
01:14:19,640 --> 01:14:31,550
I mean, how how relevant of a concern is that that if we don't pay high prices for some of these, you know, really interesting innovations and I.

667
01:14:32,750 --> 01:14:34,020
You know, that's a recent development.

668
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:39,290
I think there's a fine line between like how much like patients pay compared to like how much the insurance company pays.

669
01:14:39,290 --> 01:14:43,499
Because I know that a lot of like PBMs, everyone like co-pay, accumulator programs.

670
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:48,760
So I kind of take away some of the patient revenue for themselves as opposed to giving it to like manufacturers.

671
01:14:48,780 --> 01:14:52,170
I think that's also something to look into. Yeah.

672
01:14:52,200 --> 01:15:01,680
And that's yeah. Another great point here, too. We always think of, you know, manufacturer versus the patient or the payer.

673
01:15:01,860 --> 01:15:08,960
But in the end, in the middle, you have the PBM. As an intermediary here.

674
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:13,310
And you know,

675
01:15:13,640 --> 01:15:21,080
we sometimes think about PBM is as needs is kind of negotiating on our behalf if we're the patients to get lower prices from the manufacturer.

676
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:29,390
But if instead they're just siphoning off a certain fraction of that and as a middleman kind of increasing costs, you know, that can be a problem.

677
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:40,520
And typically you think about market power and there are, you know, millions.

678
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:48,680
Patients, maybe tens of manufacturers, kind of from a five forces perspective, you'd say, oh,

679
01:15:48,680 --> 01:15:53,000
the manufacturers have more market power than the patients because there's millions of undifferentiated patients.

680
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:57,020
But then you look at the PBMs and there may be like three or something PBMs.

681
01:15:57,470 --> 01:16:03,470
And so so now you say, Oh, well, now who's got the market power? Maybe it's the PBMs versus the tens of manufacturers.

682
01:16:03,680 --> 01:16:11,420
And also then you have the insurance companies, too, here. But there are probably, you know, hundreds of insurance companies.

683
01:16:12,020 --> 01:16:15,350
Yeah. So they're kind of interesting market dynamics here.

684
01:16:16,100 --> 01:16:19,819
It's unclear if this is not what probably clear.

685
01:16:19,820 --> 01:16:22,850
This isn't the optimal structure. One is unclear.

686
01:16:23,570 --> 01:16:28,130
You know, if if there are other system, the other which other approach would be a better one?

687
01:16:28,550 --> 01:16:32,810
I suppose there are a lot of problems with other alternative arrangements as well,

688
01:16:32,990 --> 01:16:38,690
but this clearly isn't some sort of perfection handed down from high.

689
01:16:43,410 --> 01:16:51,570
Other questions or thoughts. Okay.

690
01:16:51,930 --> 01:16:56,820
I think I will wrap up then and just also mention your.

691
01:16:57,060 --> 01:16:58,540
So next week or so.

692
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:11,520
First of all, we I think we don't have I think I said we don't have class on Wednesday and then next Monday will be another project workday.

693
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:18,390
And then next Wednesday we'll have a guest speaker and come up with some reading.

694
01:17:18,720 --> 01:17:22,680
I think there's one reading for that. And then we have the final presentations.

695
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:28,649
And just for the final presentations here, typically you want to think about kind of introduction methods,

696
01:17:28,650 --> 01:17:36,180
results in results from the base, case results show sensitivity analysis, the discussion, tournament policy and limitation implications.

697
01:17:36,180 --> 01:17:42,960
Limitations of your analysis and future research. There are a lot of things potentially covered here.

698
01:17:43,170 --> 01:17:50,300
I would really be light on the introduction of methods.

699
01:17:50,310 --> 01:17:54,180
Don't spend half your time saying, Oh, here's what our topic's all about.

700
01:17:54,300 --> 01:17:57,540
I really want you to meet at this presentation to be results and discussion.

701
01:17:59,010 --> 01:18:04,079
So give us an intro so we know what you're talking about and methods. So we know how you did it in a high level.

702
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:07,200
But really, I think it'll be most interesting.

703
01:18:07,620 --> 01:18:09,720
We've already seen some of that other stuff before.

704
01:18:09,990 --> 01:18:14,340
So I think really focus on the results and discussion will be the best use of your time for your projects.

705
01:18:14,730 --> 01:18:19,850
I have about 15 minutes and my typical recommendation here is, you know,

706
01:18:20,370 --> 01:18:24,209
so many times you're faster than this, but you know, roughly about a spy per minute.

707
01:18:24,210 --> 01:18:26,670
Use visuals to the best of your ability here.

708
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:37,230
And also, if you have preferences for those presentation dates or presentation order during class, that's December 5th and seventh.

709
01:18:37,590 --> 01:18:39,330
Let me know if you have a preference for that.

710
01:18:39,690 --> 01:18:48,480
And so, you know, if you have any questions and I enjoy the Thanksgiving holiday and I will see you next week.

711
01:18:50,020 --> 01:19:01,190
Thank you. In some dramatic upheaval.

712
01:19:01,190 --> 01:19:16,200
Demonstrators on Monday. You should go for extensions of horizon like that, which is kind of like your taxes,

713
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:21,360
like since you guys kind of lie to me because that's like cool proposition.

714
01:19:22,770 --> 01:19:31,656
Yeah. Well, I'm going to visit her after a few more serious but minor things.
