1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,730
Yeah, right. Got it.

2
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:11,030
Okay. So I'll make sure that we finish well on time today.

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,470
We're a little late Tuesday.

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:26,669
Let's start with, ah, just a quick discussion of the article and I'll read, of course, read your discussions on this and then we'll do a case study.

5
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:32,730
So we'll have some time where you can work independently or together on a case study and then we'll kind of go through it together today.

6
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:38,850
So. So no formal lecture today. Okay.

7
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:49,320
So hopefully, first of all, today in your article discussions, this was published in the Annals of Internal Medicine in 2014.

8
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:55,350
The reason I still have a review in this class is it has received a lot of attention.

9
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:04,319
It's still cited quite a bit. So it's kind of held in terms of not necessarily controversy.

10
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,370
I think it's less controversial now than it maybe was when it first came out,

11
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:16,380
just because there have been more and more data to potentially support some of the conclusions of this article.

12
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:25,890
But this was a meta analysis. This was the Association of dietary circulating and supplement fatty acids with area risk.

13
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:38,069
And so this paper looked at 72 individual studies to gauge how different fats influence the risk for coronary disease, which was defined.

14
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:42,600
So I always like to see what outcomes they're looking at and then how they define those outcomes.

15
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:47,309
Same with exposures. What are the exposures to looking at and then how are those defined?

16
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:53,950
So they defined risk for coronary disease as a fatal or nonfatal M.I.

17
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:59,600
So a myocardial infarction, that's a heart attack, coronary insufficiency.

18
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:06,360
Now, depending on how they defined that, there could be various ways in different studies.

19
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:15,749
Again, when you compile a bunch of studies in a review or a meta analysis, it's always good to see how they define things.

20
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:22,229
So that's a little bit broad. The also looked at coronary death angina.

21
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:27,000
So just chest pain, angiographic coronary sinuses.

22
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,270
So some some evidence of maybe plaque buildup and then stenosis of the vessels.

23
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:42,960
So they included 45 prospective observational cohort studies in the analysis and 27 randomized controlled trials.

24
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:52,230
The RC cheese looked at fatty acid supplement supplementation in trials in which the participants were randomly assigned to different diets,

25
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,110
as well as the observational studies in which participants intake of fatty acids was determined by

26
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:04,470
either asking them about their diet or measuring the fatty acids circulating in the bloodstream.

27
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:12,900
And I'll be honest, I don't know much about the utility of the fatty acid biomarkers,

28
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:20,940
so I think they looked at those blood levels of different fatty acids, but also like tissue sample and adipose tissue.

29
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:32,009
I don't know enough about that to like I would I would guess that like circulating fatty acids may be influenced by recent dietary intake.

30
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:43,320
So it'd be interesting to really if we get a really big deep dive to look at how those individual studies included in the analysis.

31
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:48,190
What was the methods for the measuring of the fatty acids like?

32
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,420
Were the patients fats or the subjects fasting?

33
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:54,540
Did it consider their dietary intake or whatnot?

34
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:04,460
All right. This is just the first table that looks at kind of the summary of the studies included.

35
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:11,120
So these are the prospective cohort studies of dietary fatty acid intake.

36
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:16,220
That's usually what I'm most interested in. But of course, we will consider all of these.

37
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:21,500
So dietary questionnaire. Did anybody see how those were defined?

38
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:28,070
What types of things were considered? A dietary questionnaire in this meta analysis?

39
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:36,830
Yeah. Oh, yes. One of them was a dietary recall.

40
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:40,280
Like a 24 hour recall food diaries.

41
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:46,609
But they also had a food frequency questionnaire and also just diet records.

42
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:57,860
So they had open ended instruments, a 24 hour recall food diaries, which are more like perspective, and then the food frequency questionnaire.

43
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:05,930
So those are all different methods that are then going to be combined into the measure of dietary intake.

44
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:14,470
Okay. So these fatty acid biomarkers circulating fatty acid composition, and then the adipose tissue,

45
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:20,320
fatty acid composition, again, that's only two out of those out of all of these studies.

46
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:28,930
All right. So again, I'm always more interested in the dietary intake results.

47
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:38,559
So what did this first figure, what is this showing us when we look at this is talking about the relative risks for those coronary outcomes.

48
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:44,290
Again, multiple outcomes in prospective cohort studies of dietary fatty acid intake.

49
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:48,880
So these are the prospective studies looking at dietary intake.

50
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:54,790
What does this show us? Yeah.

51
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:02,670
Just like those two separate reads.

52
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,990
Reviews of entrance documents. Yeah.

53
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:13,989
So if we look at, you know, if we're looking at a relative risk, if something crosses that whole value,

54
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:18,480
which is like a relative risk of one means, there's like no difference in risk.

55
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:29,139
Right? So if you are at any point, if you have your little and whiskers touching that line, that means it's not going to be a significant finding.

56
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:38,740
Right, because it includes that null value. So if we look at what's outside of that, like either this way, which would be more of a protective effect,

57
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:45,940
so your relative risk is lower with the consumption of whatever nutrient we're looking at for outcome.

58
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:56,760
So that's the omega three fatty acid intake. And then this is pretty, pretty notable that those trans fatty acids are above that relative risk.

59
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:59,100
And that's been really a consistent finding.

60
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:07,450
So trans fat to eat them consistently has shown that there is an increased risk for a variety of culinary outcomes.

61
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:17,470
So when comparing the top versus the bottom thirds of dietary fatty acid intake from these prospective cohorts,

62
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:23,010
prospective studies probably a lot for a large cohort study.

63
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:29,590
The relative risk for outcomes associated with total saturated fat intake was not significant.

64
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:36,640
So let's take a look at this one. It's the very top one. So it's a relative risk of 1.03.

65
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:43,330
So it includes that in all value as we look at that confidence interval 0.98 to 1.07

66
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:49,510
and similar findings were found for total model and saturated fat intake as well.

67
00:07:51,430 --> 00:08:01,810
What do you just if you're looking at it, if you're not ignoring like statistics, what does this show you in this box here?

68
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:08,500
We're talking about saturated fat number. It's comparing kind of the top to bottom third of.

69
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:23,080
What if you're just like us that we took away this like any of this information?

70
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:27,120
Just look. This this right here. Does anything stand out to you?

71
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:33,310
Yes. This one is not within the system.

72
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:39,420
So it doesn't this important right there.

73
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,960
This is not. Yes, exactly.

74
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:49,920
So for omega three fatty acids, this is not for us to set on why that is a significant sign of a reduced risk.

75
00:08:51,030 --> 00:09:01,260
What about this very first one for saturated fat? Yeah, it's like it's like this squares, like the square is larger with.

76
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:07,050
What do you notice about the little? Yeah, it's very small.

77
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:11,450
Right. What do you what does that tell you?

78
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:20,850
If we're comparing top versus bottom thirds of dietary intake of saturated fat and we have this small.

79
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:29,399
These whiskers are pretty small. Yeah, exactly.

80
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,670
So that's a huge criticism of this paper.

81
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:44,400
For for saturated fat, the top versus bottom in terms of the highest consumers and the lower consumers, which are those that are being compared?

82
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,280
We're pretty close. Right.

83
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:57,480
So those that have high intake as defined by the study were probably not that much different than those that have lower intake for comparison.

84
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:02,220
So what happens if you compare two groups that aren't that different?

85
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:08,780
Do you do you often detect a difference in the outcome using that?

86
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:15,000
No. And then they did it right. The relative risk is 1.03.

87
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:25,350
So that's a big criticism as a the groups you're comparing are not that different and B, they're both have high intake of saturated fat.

88
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:32,250
What else? If you just look at where this sadness, this is just like visual.

89
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:35,040
It's really not fair because it doesn't line up with the statistics,

90
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:46,030
but it's over the line in the direction that maybe would be like, okay, it's like hovering still if the risk is this way, right?

91
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:48,270
If anything over here is going to be a higher risk.

92
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:55,080
So if you look at the position, again, that's not really fair to do because statistically it wasn't significant.

93
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:58,260
But where this is, Hubbard is leaning towards a higher risk.

94
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:09,340
So the groups were not that different with regard to their intake and their intake was high and the risk was still high.

95
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:16,229
So I think that's the problem with saturated fat research in that analysis is that we're looking at

96
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:23,670
something where our risk for cardiac outcomes is high in this country and many other countries.

97
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:31,049
So whether or not your consumption of saturated fat increases that risk,

98
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:36,330
usually it's not associated with an increased risk, almost like just maintaining your risk.

99
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:40,110
So you're maintaining a high risk with that level of intake.

100
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:52,700
So I think sometimes that how that gets translated is that whether your intake is high or low, there was no difference in outcomes.

101
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:57,150
But both of these groups had high intake and high risk.

102
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:04,650
Does that make sense? Kind of.

103
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:15,780
So there's no difference in outcomes between the group, but the outcome is still potentially an elevated risk and their intake is still.

104
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:22,640
Both groups had a high intake. So that's that was a big problem with this.

105
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:30,389
This little box we see is that those the differences between the groups are potentially not not that different.

106
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:35,940
So when we're comparing similar groups, we're often not going to find a difference in the outcome.

107
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:42,030
Okay. So what about these monounsaturated fatty acids? Was anybody surprised to see that?

108
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:46,010
Because usually that's touted and even though we had some discussion about panel, etc.,

109
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:52,260
yes, it's this really you know, if you look at the relative risk, it's right up one.

110
00:12:52,770 --> 00:13:01,169
So no difference in outcomes between the highest and lowest consumption of any acids with anybody surprised by that,

111
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:05,910
since these are potentially touted as like healthy heart healthy fatty acids.

112
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:12,270
Not super surprised. No. Yeah.

113
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:15,670
No, I don't. Ethnic. Yeah.

114
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:29,940
Not better. I think the reason that it's not as healthy as an time to put something into my head.

115
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:44,250
Has been the most. Oh, okay. I think it's I think traditionally we've had consider them very healthy.

116
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:49,120
That's because of the content and. Well, but you're right.

117
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:52,630
Not all unsaturated fatty acids have some saturated fats.

118
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:59,530
And the criticism of this study is that the studies included in this analysis that looked

119
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:06,790
at mono and saturated fatty acid intake were primarily from the food sources of the model.

120
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:14,410
Unsaturated fatty acids of the studies included were primarily dairy and red meat as opposed to the plant based oils.

121
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:24,130
So that could make a difference if the majority of your model and saturated fatty acid intake is coming from red meat,

122
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,870
you may not see the real benefit as this means. Where do see it from like now?

123
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:37,050
Predominantly olive oil or nuts? Yes, I would hope so.

124
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:44,700
That not that that's misleading because that is a big source of monologues have trade in fatty acids, especially in this country.

125
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:53,519
But it probably doesn't tell the whole story. But these fatty acids, let's see.

126
00:14:53,520 --> 00:15:00,749
And then we did we talked about the omega three that showed significant protective effect and then the trans fats.

127
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:04,800
Of course, there are over here an increased risk.

128
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:13,890
So total polyunsaturated fatty acid intake was also not associated with a decreased risk of coronary event.

129
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:26,579
The relative risk there was .98. There were some calls for this to be retracted because the the studies that they included for

130
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:35,940
the assessment of other omega six fatty acids had incorrect risk ratios that were then added.

131
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:39,540
So that is a problem, right, for getting the data wrong.

132
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:43,799
But they I think we did that analysis and it didn't really change the conclusions.

133
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:54,840
But it's a lot of a lot of issues, a lot of letters to the editor to have this looked at because of the conclusions that were made.

134
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:03,260
Okay. So one thing another thing to note, there was evidence of heterogeneity among the studies included.

135
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:19,149
What does that mean if we're looking at a meta analysis? There's ways when when scientists are conducting net analysis,

136
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:29,410
there's statistical methods they can use to assess what we call heterogeneity or how divergent or different the studies are.

137
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:39,490
Why is that important in a meta analysis where you're pooling results to make one kind of outcome measure?

138
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:51,070
If you want to make apples to apples and say, well, you can't do that, that's you know, it's really hard to hear this.

139
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:56,040
Exactly. So you want your populations,

140
00:16:56,050 --> 00:17:05,470
your exposures and your outcomes to be comparable if you're going to put them all together and just come up with one measure here.

141
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:09,350
So like this is looking at how many say you say, you know,

142
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:18,549
47 studies to then come up with one measure from those studies if they're very different is is can be potentially really misleading.

143
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:24,280
So you will almost always see a measure of heterogeneity looked at as in meta analysis.

144
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:32,290
And there was evidence for that, meaning that the studies that were put together were potentially very different in what they examined.

145
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:38,680
So that can be a limitation. Let's see what else.

146
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:50,920
Talked about the model in saturated fat in the studies was mostly from red meat and dairy products, not from nuts, olive oil and other plant sources.

147
00:17:53,200 --> 00:18:01,629
Okay, also something like this. We know that if when you lower saturated fat intake but replace it with carbohydrates,

148
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:07,240
you can lower LDL levels without seeing a change in heart disease.

149
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:17,049
So there's no way to know like replacement of of foods like those that had low intake, what else were they consuming?

150
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:22,870
So if they were on the lower end of saturated fat, did they have higher consumption of refined carbohydrate?

151
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:27,490
Again, that's getting a little nip there, but that's an important consideration.

152
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:29,770
Those with lower intake,

153
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:40,530
what didn't they then have more or less of in their diet would be an important detail as well to really make some some conclusions about risk here.

154
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:52,750
Okay. So this is looking at the relative risk recorded outcomes in prospect, the prospective studies of circulating fatty acid composition.

155
00:18:53,400 --> 00:19:02,530
Again, I don't know enough about this measure to speak to it, but you know, this is like pretty wavy if we look at all the different fatty acids.

156
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:09,640
Does anything stand out here to you guys? Yeah.

157
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:16,130
Four out of the six omega three is are significantly protective.

158
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:24,050
Yeah. That's yeah. That's what if you look at again, here's our line of like no risk.

159
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:32,690
This is the group where we see some more of a protective effect pretty consistently with the omega three fatty acids.

160
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:40,670
So that's that's a that's pretty concordant with a lot of the data that's out there that these do, in fact,

161
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:51,230
lower risk here in terms of the outcomes measure the omega six polyunsaturated fatty acids, you know, there's one that's below the line here.

162
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:56,120
The other is kind of like reading a little bit over this way.

163
00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:03,650
So that's that's interesting, too, not seeing quite the protective effect that observational studies have shown.

164
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:08,090
And again, that could be due to some error in an input,

165
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:19,070
but it really essentially was not these conclusions didn't really change when they they did make some adjustments in the studies that they included.

166
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:30,670
What about saturated fat? It really just depends kind of on which specific type.

167
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:37,749
According to this study and all that. One mark was Margaret is like professor.

168
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:43,570
Yeah, that's right. Yeah. But then yeah. And just kind of it seems like kind of hit or miss according to this study.

169
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:50,320
Yeah, they're pretty divergent in terms of individual saturated fatty acids and risk.

170
00:20:52,870 --> 00:21:04,750
And it's I think that could be I think I know Palmitic acid is one of the more common saturated fatty acids in the fluids in the US food supply.

171
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:13,540
There's quite a bit of citric acid, but like the larger acid that that would be nuts differently.

172
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:26,260
So anybody though have thoughts like as a future dietitian potentially looking at these individual fatty acids and risk, is this helpful?

173
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:40,350
I mean, kind of. But we're not just eating isolated, citric acid.

174
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:51,300
So this is good to know. But I think it gets overblown in terms of the real utility and translating into practice, in my opinion.

175
00:21:54,210 --> 00:22:03,830
Okay. So. Let's take a peek at some of the backlash this.

176
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,890
Okay. So again, this is out of the Harvard group.

177
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:27,630
Who is responsible for our nurses health study or health professionals follow up study?

178
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,569
Why were they so upset, this man analysis?

179
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:39,080
Because it really kind of took their findings and it kind of flipped them like almost made it seem like, you know,

180
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:47,610
really this caught it from what they found from those very large prospective cohort studies which are well done.

181
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:50,220
But they are also of course, there are limitations there.

182
00:22:50,730 --> 00:23:01,680
So this is just a publication that was written in response to that paper suggesting that it is potentially very misleading.

183
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:08,339
So it's talking about there that the conclusions of that meta analysis suggests there's

184
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:12,540
no evidence supporting the long standing recommendation to limit saturated fat intake.

185
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:24,000
And so they just they did put in a specific letter to the editor, but the paper is bound to cause confusion.

186
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:28,650
A central issue is what replaces saturated fat. Somebody reduces the amount in their diet.

187
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:31,860
If it's replaced with refined sugar like we talked about,

188
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,810
then the risk of heart disease remains the same or newer studies have shown it may actually go up.

189
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:44,480
So if saturated fat is replaced with polyunsaturated fat or models unsaturated fat from olive oil,

190
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:48,240
nuts and seeds, we have evidence that the risk will be reduced.

191
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:56,130
So there's really no discussion of that. And he also talked about there is multiple errors and omissions.

192
00:23:56,310 --> 00:24:06,630
And some of the studies included were, in fact, again, like I mentioned, inaccurate in their relative risks that were added to the model.

193
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:16,469
So this was a huge deal. This is Walter Willett. He's like probably one of the most renowned nutritional epidemiologist.

194
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:19,840
So he is kind of the pi on those big observational studies.

195
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:24,060
And so he he called for a retraction. That did not happen.

196
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:34,110
The analysis did get adjusted, but this was a big a big deal in the nutritional world.

197
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:42,300
So I think that leads us that would lend a discussion to sex or meta analysis in general.

198
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:47,930
So I want to talk about that briefly. Okay.

199
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:52,040
So what is the benefit of a meta analysis, do you think?

200
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:57,670
Because there are more and more popular. Yeah.

201
00:24:57,690 --> 00:25:00,760
Many the the literature on the topic.

202
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:06,330
So you don't have to look. Yeah, it kind of takes.

203
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:18,540
Okay, let's look at this whole body of evidence for maybe this one topic and give like a general or like composite value or conclusion from it.

204
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:23,250
Right. So in theory, combining studies gives you a larger population.

205
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:31,170
So meta analysis really should have more power than like a single study to detect meaningful differences.

206
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:40,590
However, like we discussed, some analysis lumped together studies with very different populations, different methods,

207
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:47,460
and that variability can reduce the power actually of the studies so the real effects can be missed.

208
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:57,570
So like for this Chowdhury meta analysis, eating saturated fat or in a lot of studies in obesity,

209
00:25:57,930 --> 00:26:02,130
being overweight no longer looks so dangerous in a meta analysis.

210
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:07,290
And some will argue that's just an artifact of this method where you can almost

211
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:14,160
dilute the real association by combining a bunch of potentially discordant studies.

212
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:26,150
So some science that compiled data from many individual studies to get a clear result are popular,

213
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:31,249
like we talked about, because then it can now be said synthesize a lot of data into one.

214
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:37,170
So they tend to get a lot of attention once they're published. And I think that's continue to be the case.

215
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:45,319
Those are usually when we have like a 32nd blip of a recent study out on the news.

216
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:49,070
A lot of times it might be an analysis, maybe a clinical trial.

217
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:54,200
But often it's like these these big studies that combine a lot of data.

218
00:26:56,330 --> 00:27:01,850
So what type of studies do you think meta analyzes tend to work very well for?

219
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:13,450
Because there are certain settings that they're probably really well well-suited for.

220
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:22,060
Yeah, I don't know specifically, but just ones that have similar criteria like we were talking about like Yeah.

221
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,620
That are really looking at the same thing.

222
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:30,060
So a lot of times that's like drug trials so well or, you know,

223
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:35,010
randomized trials that are looking at an intervention of like a drug or a supplement where it's

224
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:40,829
pretty well controlled in terms of like who was given what and how much or at least you know,

225
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:45,479
that information. So drug trials are often similar in design.

226
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:52,110
Make it making it easy to combine the results then analysis are not easy in terms of that that statistical practice.

227
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:58,229
But so that's like an example of something that might work really nicely for a meta analysis.

228
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:07,100
Like even those fish oil supplementation studies like it might make sense to do a meta analysis to look at all that data as long as they were pretty,

229
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,810
pretty similar in their approach to that design.

230
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:21,809
Nutritional studies, when we're looking especially dietary intake, often vary really widely in the way they are set up and how,

231
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:29,400
again, diet as a measure is ascertained, you know, 24 hour recall is really different than a food frequency questionnaire.

232
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:38,430
Right? Or like a prospective food diary, it's different than somebody asking open ended questions about your intake.

233
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:49,350
So often the strengths and weaknesses of individual studies get lost and those associations can become diluted in a meta analysis.

234
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:55,540
So again, small but important associations are often lost in a about analysis.

235
00:28:56,650 --> 00:29:01,780
Should we disregard a well-done observational study that did have good methods?

236
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:06,580
If those results are polluted or not observed in the analysis, what do you think?

237
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:14,319
So like the the meta analysis, we looked at a different conclusions than what has been shown in like the nurses health study,

238
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:23,710
the health professionals follow up. So should we kind of disregard those results because a different finding was was found in that meta analysis.

239
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:31,030
Yeah. Not entirely disregard the results, but they limited generalizability.

240
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:37,890
Search results because it might not violate other populations and things like that that may have also been included in that analysis.

241
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:49,450
Yeah. So don't disregard, especially if the studies were well designed and the standards prospective studies are are kind of the gold standard.

242
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:57,790
We can't do a randomized trial for a reason, but yes, consider the generalizability of like a cohort study,

243
00:29:57,790 --> 00:30:06,030
especially among like the nurses health study gets it gets some flak on generalizability.

244
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:10,210
Does anybody know why? And I don't expect you to know the history with that study.

245
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:16,299
But if you think about the title of the Nurses Health study, who was the population of women?

246
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:25,540
They're looking at nurses. Power nurses may be different than all women in the U.S.

247
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:33,490
And probably probably some more analogies about health in general.

248
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:42,130
They're healthy enough to be working right as a nurse, so they're healthy enough to work professionally.

249
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:47,890
So that's sort of a criticism of that. And the health professionals follow up study.

250
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:52,960
Same thing. These are males that are primarily doctors.

251
00:30:53,830 --> 00:31:00,440
That's a pretty specific group. A lot of, you know, that's really applies to that population.

252
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:06,970
So, yes, really considering who we are generalizing our observational fitness to.

253
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:12,220
And so maybe that analysis would be potentially more generalizable in that sense.

254
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:23,090
So that analysis can be a useful summary of a large pool of data if high quality studies with similar groups of people and study methods are used.

255
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:30,470
So that's at their best. At their worst. It can be a mismatch of findings from studies that differ significantly.

256
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:40,700
Comparing apples to oranges that offer. This is from the Harvard folks that offer meaningless or even misleading conclusions.

257
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:48,410
That's probably a little bit. Drastic of a language to use, but flawed men.

258
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:56,630
Analyzes and nutritional sciences have increasingly made headlines by producing seemingly definitive summaries on popular topics,

259
00:31:57,140 --> 00:32:00,740
stirring up controversies and types of dietary fat and heart disease.

260
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:04,850
Specifically, there's a lot more than just this one that have come out recently,

261
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:10,430
and also the relationship of excess weight and risk of premature death, among others.

262
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:22,610
So those that are. Looking at, trying to avoid I don't know how to say this specifically,

263
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:30,200
but there is a group of scientists that repeatedly referenced a study that a met analysis

264
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:36,380
that showed that excess weight did not lead to premature death or risk of premature death.

265
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:47,120
And that is a really flawed analysis. But you will hear that reference often as it as kind of a dig at why we focus so much on overweight and obesity,

266
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:51,859
which there are definitely negatives to doing that.

267
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:56,810
But that specific meta analysis that often is referenced has a lot of issues, too.

268
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:05,149
So the result of having too many differences in amount analysis is a what is a wider variation in the findings,

269
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:11,660
which again can then skew the conclusion or dilute an otherwise significant finding if the studies are too variable.

270
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:17,149
So I would say when these men analysis come out, because this is a very popular approach.

271
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:28,940
Now just read the article, not just the abstract, not just the headline, see what kind of studies were included,

272
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:38,620
if it's something you're interested in and really see how variable, you know, did they control for that or address the heterogeneity?

273
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:42,560
How were the studies selected all of that before?

274
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:45,380
Just kind of making broad conclusions from it.

275
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:54,200
But you know, this and that analysis that we talked about today probably isn't as controversial as it once was,

276
00:33:54,200 --> 00:34:03,500
because we do have more and more supporting data that maybe saturated fatty acids are not definitely not as harmful as trans fats.

277
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:11,570
The problem is the messaging that saturated fatty acids may not increase our risk of heart disease, but our risk is already high.

278
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:20,089
So when we replace saturated fats with these polyunsaturated fats model and saturated fatty acids, we definitely see a reduced risk.

279
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:30,260
And that is that has been consistent. So there is a benefit to lowering saturated fat when you do that, replace it with these other healthier fats.

280
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:40,100
Okay. So does anybody have any thoughts or questions about this meta analysis or about analysis in general?

281
00:34:41,930 --> 00:34:46,220
Yeah. Well, you want to just.

282
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:50,810
Yeah. So the search part also.

283
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:55,580
I know, you know, what we want is of those.

284
00:34:55,890 --> 00:35:00,980
So yeah. So that's another thing. If you're interested in research,

285
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:10,430
a meta analysis should always have a table that has their inclusion criteria for what studies were then included and why some were excluded.

286
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:18,290
They'll always have that, or they should have that figure, but it could be bias in the way that works.

287
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:22,579
So when we do our research, it's a good idea.

288
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:29,270
We always look at these groups that seems to be agree, but then we also need to look at the opposite.

289
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:32,390
That's what I, I want to see the. Oh, yeah.

290
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:40,550
You can't just you can't just include studies that you wanna show the outcome of interest or the outcome you want to see.

291
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:48,379
Right. And usually that it should be there should be a relatively good framework for how you select these.

292
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:50,750
But of course there can be some bias,

293
00:35:50,750 --> 00:36:00,280
which is there a lot of sequences we're talking about that if this were not how you do it, then the outcome is very different.

294
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:07,970
Oh, yeah. I mean, this, you know, if they try to control for, you know, smoking status, maybe.

295
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:18,259
But there's so many things, so many other variables that are difficult for that could in terms of the risk of that taking is one thing.

296
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:22,640
Are you able to to metabolizes quality?

297
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:30,260
That's true. Sure. Yeah. And so usually you would hope that the studies that were then conducted would

298
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:35,719
probably be an either relatively healthy population for that like liver disease,

299
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:40,990
for instance, would probably be an exclusion criteria for some things.

300
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:46,100
The only problem is probably is probably most who are not very healthy.

301
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:55,549
Sure. Yeah. Okay. So let's try and put together some of what we've talked about the past few days.

302
00:36:55,550 --> 00:37:01,430
So I'm going to have you open up the case study I posted on campus.

303
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:13,170
Let's take a look at that. And this will just be something we'll discuss.

304
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:25,920
Class. So read through the case, study it, get a good understanding of this patient's history, and then you can work together or on your own.

305
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:32,009
We're going to go through these questions. So we're going to take about like half an hour or so just to kind of work through these.

306
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:37,740
And then we'll discuss them for the last ten, 20 minutes of class.

307
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:49,140
So if you will calculate the ten year risk of heart disease and stroke, write to nutrition diagnoses for this patient to smart goals.

308
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:59,160
Right. At least two interventions. Okay. And then how would you translate our not necessarily dietary guidelines,

309
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:04,290
but what we've talked about in terms of the appropriate M.A. for this patient?

310
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:11,250
How would you translate that into actual recommendations of like food choices for for this patient?

311
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:20,399
And then we'll talk about what we could monitor. So make sure you do spend a little bit of time on a number five to see how you would actually try.

312
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:26,490
And based on this patient's history, risk current intake,

313
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:34,200
how would you apply current recommendations to improve his heart health with specific dietary recommendations?

314
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:42,379
Okay. So let's take probably at least 25 minutes or so to work through this.

315
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:43,970
So we'll look at it together.
