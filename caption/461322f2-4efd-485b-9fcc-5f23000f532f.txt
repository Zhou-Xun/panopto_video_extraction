1
00:00:03,243 --> 00:00:09,770
So next, let's talk about the Biology and
mechanisms underlying infectious disease.

2
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:14,090
Pathogenic microorganisms generally
fall into five broad categories.

3
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:18,390
Bacteria, Viruses, Fungi,
Parasites, and Prions.

4
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:20,590
Although there are some that
don't fall into these groups,

5
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:23,080
like certain types of algae.

6
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:28,130
One example of the disease that's caused
by a bacteria is Tuberculosis or TB.

7
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:32,970
TB is caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium
tuberculosis, and TB has been around for

8
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:33,650
a long time.

9
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:37,060
When you peer people talk of
consumption in historical movies or

10
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:39,530
books, they're often referring to TB.

11
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:44,950
And so it's transmitted via coughing,
sneezing, and in close quarters

12
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:48,320
you can have kind of this sort of airborne
transmission from person to person.

13
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,000
It has a latent phase
that can be quite long.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,270
And then it can eventually, it can move to
an active phase, where it causes coughing,

15
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:59,920
chest pain, eventually coughing blood,
weakness, chills, fever.

16
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,230
And TB is fairly widespread.

17
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:04,492
It infects 8 million people every year,
and

18
00:01:04,492 --> 00:01:07,280
causes 2 million deaths
per year worldwide.

19
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,141
Two major issues emerging with TB
include co-infection with HIV, and

20
00:01:11,141 --> 00:01:18,661
increase in drug resistance that can
make it very difficult to treat.

21
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:21,860
One example of a disease caused
by a parasite is Malaria,

22
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:25,780
which is caused by the protozoan
parasite of the genus Plasmodium.

23
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:29,970
And there are several different
kinds of these Plasmodium parasites.

24
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:35,260
But they tend to cause fever, chills,
sweating, headaches, nausea, and vomiting.

25
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:39,910
And the disease is vector-borne, so it's
transmitted by Anopheles mosquitoes, and

26
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:44,780
it passes between humans and mosquitoes
as part of its transmission cycle.

27
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:48,250
It infects over 300 million
people per year, and

28
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:51,190
causes over a million
deaths per year worldwide.

29
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:55,610
Many of the interventions for Malaria
involve prevention of mosquito bites,

30
00:01:55,610 --> 00:02:00,610
by for instance using mosquito netting, or
insect repellents as well as spraying for

31
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:04,070
mosquitos and removing standing water so
that they can't breed.

32
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:08,459
There are also anti-malarial medications
that travelers can take, and there's not

33
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:15,262
yet a malaria vaccine, although
that's an area of active research.

34
00:02:15,262 --> 00:02:19,890
Lastly, an example of a disease
caused by a virus is the flu.

35
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,400
And so, influenza or

36
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,660
the flu is a seasonable respiratory
virus that affects people of all ages.

37
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:29,790
It causes about 36,000 deaths
annually in the U.S. alone.

38
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:32,760
It spread through airborne particles, or

39
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:37,740
by touching surfaces with flu viruses on
it, and then touching your mouth or nose.

40
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:41,840
And so probably most of you have
had the flu, but it causes coughs,

41
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,750
fever, muscle aches, chills,
tiredness, and headaches.

42
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:49,690
And it has a contagious period
of about one day before

43
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:52,720
to five days after the onset of symptoms.

44
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,560
To avoid getting the flu, you wanna
make sure that you get vaccinated, so

45
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,130
there's a flu vaccine that's
available every year.

46
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:03,009
You wanna practice good hand hygiene,
and avoid close contact with those who

47
00:03:03,009 --> 00:03:09,867
are sick, and also avoid touching
your eyes, nose, or mouth.
