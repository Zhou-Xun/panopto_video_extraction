1
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:13,516
After watching this video, you will
be able to describe usual formats for

2
00:00:13,516 --> 00:00:17,910
table 1 in research articles.

3
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,340
Let's assume that you're finally ready for
the analysis.

4
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:22,514
You got the data.

5
00:00:22,514 --> 00:00:26,030
You clean it,
you have your analysis blank ready, and

6
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:29,478
you are more than ready to
start analyzing your data.

7
00:00:29,478 --> 00:00:30,903
So what do you do first?

8
00:00:30,903 --> 00:00:31,556
And second?

9
00:00:31,556 --> 00:00:33,770
And third?

10
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:36,812
In general and
think about the final product.

11
00:00:36,812 --> 00:00:38,216
A research article.

12
00:00:38,216 --> 00:00:43,880
Most epidemiologic research that is trying
to assess exposure outcome relationships,

13
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:48,949
will need to have some type of descriptive
analysis, that will be our table 1.

14
00:00:48,949 --> 00:00:51,465
Then some type of bivariate analysis or

15
00:00:51,465 --> 00:00:54,677
confounded assessment
that will be our table 2.

16
00:00:54,677 --> 00:00:59,000
And some type of multivariable
analysis that will be our table 3.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,543
So, although of course this
is not the same always for

18
00:01:02,543 --> 00:01:05,800
most of the articles that you will.

19
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:09,074
This will actually be the case and
this is what we are going to follow for

20
00:01:09,074 --> 00:01:10,550
this course.

21
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:14,278
Also, although I was talking
more on that later table 1 and

22
00:01:14,278 --> 00:01:18,828
table 2 will help you to evaluate
confounding, because they're often

23
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:24,860
the outcome covariate and
they exposure covariate tables.

24
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:29,190
So we will agree the more
table 1 are the scripted.

25
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:32,357
But in truth they come in all colors and
flavors.

26
00:01:32,357 --> 00:01:37,047
For example, this is an outcome
covariate table where characteristic of

27
00:01:37,047 --> 00:01:39,850
reported by case control status.

28
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:44,600
And also there is some type of bivariate
analysis because they're P values.

29
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,970
You can see reported P
values on the right.

30
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:52,970
However, this other one is in
this partial covariate table.

31
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:56,861
We do have here all the covariates
work winters of this portion,

32
00:01:56,861 --> 00:02:00,463
which is dieteria Alpha,
linolenic acid in this case, and

33
00:02:00,463 --> 00:02:04,666
we will use this partial coverage
table as our table 2 in our course.

34
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:07,666
So even though this authors
use it as a table 1,

35
00:02:07,666 --> 00:02:12,470
we will use this type of
table as our table 2.

36
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:16,544
And of course you can come up with
all type of possible variations.

37
00:02:16,544 --> 00:02:21,638
This table one is exclusively descripted
by sex and no P values have reported here,

38
00:02:21,638 --> 00:02:27,400
which is perfectly fine too and
you can find many elder combinations.

39
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:32,194
So the bottom line is that although
there is study specific issues that will

40
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:36,986
tell you what type of Table 1 and
Table 2 are most adequate, and also there

41
00:02:36,986 --> 00:02:41,959
are many different preferences for
the purposes of this course, we will do.

42
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:47,011
Table 1 will be the outcome covariate
table, and we're going to add P values for

43
00:02:47,011 --> 00:02:52,930
learning purposes and Table 2 will
be the exposure covariate table.

44
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:56,764
So in summary in this video will
learn about the usual formats for

45
00:02:56,764 --> 00:02:58,690
table 1 in research articles.

46
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:03,104
In the next video we will
finally start the analysis.
