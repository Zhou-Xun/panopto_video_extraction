Aging Part four, work income and poverty among the elderly.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:17,000
In previous segments of this lecture, we examine changes in the age structure of the US population and potential impact of such changes.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We also looked at health among the elderly and how this may be changing over time.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And finally, we examined the three major social programs that support the elderly Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The current segment, we'll look at work, income and poverty among the elderly and how the major social programs impact these issues.

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:50,000
As we can see, as can be seen in this diagram, poverty among the elderly has been relatively low in recent decades,

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:59,000
particularly when compared to younger segments of the population. This is a good thing, but it was not always the case.

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The graph also reveals some interesting and important historical trends.

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Prior to 1965, the poverty rate among the elderly, though declining, was much higher than among children and working age adults.

10
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:21,000
A key reason for the decline in poverty among the elderly prior to 1965 was due to the impact of Social Security.

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Recall that Social Security was created in 1935. But in order to qualify to receive benefits under Social Security,

12
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:36,000
must one of previously worked and contributed to Social Security via payment of payroll taxes and reached the age of 65.

13
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So initially the number of beneficiaries was small but then grew over time as the number of Social Security beneficiaries increased.

14
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:53,000
The poverty rate among older people declined, but in 1965, the poverty rate among the elderly had another sharp decline.

15
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:01,000
What changed? The answer is that Medicare Medicaid programs were created by Congress and went into effect in 1965.

16
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
The impact of these three social programs was so successful that by the 1980s,

17
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:16,000
poverty among the elderly was well below that for children under 18 and about the same as for working age adults 18 to 64.

18
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
And since the late 1990s, the elderly have had the lowest poverty rate.

19
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Overall, the major social programs Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid have been very successful in reducing the historically high levels of

20
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:40,000
poverty that had existed among the elderly prior to the implementation of these three programs.

21
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
So what has been the pattern of work or labor force participation over time?

22
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
One of the most conspicuous changes in employment is related to sex.

23
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:59,000
In 1945, at the end of World War Two, only about one third of women, 18 to 64 years old were employed.

24
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
But ninety five percent of men, 18 to 64 were employed.

25
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Over the ensuing decades, the employment rate of women more than doubled to just over 70 percent today,

26
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
while the corresponding rate for men has declined somewhat to about 84 percent.

27
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:27,000
But what about changes in employment among those who are 65 and older? In 1945, almost half 47 percent of men 65 and older were employed.

28
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
But by the mid 1980s, this had fallen to about 16 or 17 percent.

29
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:39,000
However, since the mid 80s, the percentage of older men who work has increased to almost 24 percent today.

30
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:46,000
For older women, the pattern of employment since 1945 has been different than for men.

31
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Overall, the employment rate for older women was low.

32
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Only about nine percent in 1945, and it stayed more or less the same until the year 2000, when it began to creep up.

33
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Currently to about 16 percent.

34
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Clearly, although the numbers have increased slightly in the last 20 years or so, fewer older people are choosing to work compared to the 1940s,

35
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
i.e. during the era before the major social programs had any significant impact.

36
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:28,000
However, these overall numbers mask some important details, which we will examine in subsequent slides.

37
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:38,000
This slide examines income sources as a percent of total income for people aged 65 and older in the year 2012.

38
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Again, there are a number of important patterns. First, among people in the lowest three income quintiles, which includes 60 percent of older adults,

39
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
the overwhelming source of income is Social Security benefits.

40
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,000
On average, people in the lowest three income quintiles have very little income from assets or pensions.

41
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
And notably, little income from earnings or current employment.

42
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:11,000
In other words, without Social Security benefits, almost all of these people would be in poverty.

43
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
But as we have seen, most of them are not.

44
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:22,000
And this reflects the impact and the success of Social Security as a social welfare and public health program.

45
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Notably, it is people in the upper two income quintiles who have substantial earnings from current employment.

46
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:39,000
These same people, on average, also receive a substantial fraction of their income from personal assets, private pensions and retirement savings.

47
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Social Security is also an important source of income among those among these wealthier people.

48
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:57,000
But it is not as critical in terms of avoiding outright poverty. So why are people with higher incomes continuing to work when they reach 65,

49
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
even when they may not need the income as much as people with lower incomes?

50
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
This is a complex question,

51
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:12,000
but a key factor has to do with the nature of employment among people with higher incomes compared to people with lower incomes.

52
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Higher income workers tend to have jobs that do that involve excuse me,

53
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
higher income workers tend to have jobs that do not involve significant physical labor.

54
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Think of lawyers, accountants, doctors and even university professors.

55
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
So even with some degree of chronic disease and physical limitation,

56
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:41,000
higher income workers can continue to perform their jobs and likely achieve fulfillment from doing so.

57
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:48,000
In contrast, lower income workers tend to be employed in jobs that require physical labor.

58
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:56,000
As we have seen previously, the prevalence of chronic disease and morbidity from chronic disease is high among the elderly.

59
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Not surprisingly,

60
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:07,000
elderly lower income workers are more likely to find it difficult or impossible to continue to perform their jobs due to physical limitations.

61
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
In addition to these observations.

62
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Recall that the prevalence of chronic disease and morbidity from chronic disease is correlated with socioeconomic status.

63
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Hence, on average,

64
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:28,000
higher income workers are likely to have fewer chronic conditions and associated morbidity compared to lower income workers overall.

65
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Despite whatever flaws they may have,

66
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Social Security and also Medicare and Medicaid have been remarkably successful in reducing poverty among the elderly.

67
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:46,000
But maybe not surprisingly, the role and positive impact of these programs has been especially important

68
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:56,000
for the large majority of people at the lower end of the income distribution.

69
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:03,000
As we've seen, sources of income among the elderly vary considerably by the level of income, in particular,

70
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Social Security is the major source of income for the 60 percent of elderly people at the lower end of the income distribution.

71
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Previously, we have seen how Social Security and the other major social programs, Medicare and Medicaid, are fiscally stressed.

72
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:27,000
One proposal for reducing such fiscal stress on Social Security has been to increase the standard age for retirement.

73
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:37,000
The standard age for retirement is the age at which one is eligible for full benefits if one retires earlier than benefits are reduced.

74
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
The standard retirement age has already been changed.

75
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:49,000
In the 1980s, the Congress passed legislation to gradually increase the standard retirement age from 65 to 67.

76
00:08:49,000 --> 00:09:01,000
This transition began in 2002 and will be fully implemented when people born in 1960 reached the age of 67 or the year 2027.

77
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
But what has been the impact of this change?

78
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:12,000
One obvious impact and a primary goal of increasing the standard retirement age has been to reduce benefits,

79
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
which serves to improve the long term fiscal status of the Social Security program.

80
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:29,000
But there are other impacts as well. The graph displays the life expectancy at age 65 for cohorts of men born in 1912 through 1941,

81
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:38,000
with the results shown separately for those in the upper and lower halves of the income distribution for those born in 1912.

82
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,000
There was very little difference in life expectancy at age 65 by income less than

83
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
one year difference between the upper and lower halves of the income distribution.

84
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:55,000
However, over time, life expectancy at age 65 has diverged by income.

85
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Men in the upper half of the income distribution have seen their life expectancy increase by about six years,

86
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:10,000
while those in the lower half of the income distribution have seen their life expectancy increase by just over one year.

87
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Hence, workers in the lower half of the income distribution are less likely to reach the

88
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:22,000
new standard retirement age of 67 and are more likely to receive reduced benefits.

89
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:32,000
And even if they do reach 67, they are projected to have shorter life expectancies and therefore are likely to receive less cumulative benefit.

90
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:40,000
This means that lower income workers who are unlikely to have alternative alternative sources of income in retirement such as assets,

91
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
private pensions,

92
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:52,000
retirement savings and ongoing employment are likely to receive even less from Social Security compared to their peers with higher incomes.

93
00:10:52,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Any further increase in the standard retirement age for Social Security would only serve to worsen these differences in outcomes.

94
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:15,000
So how did the United States end up with 65 as the standard age for retirement and receipt of benefits

95
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
over the course of the 19th century and the growth and expansion of the industrial revolution?

96
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:27,000
The issue of aging and retirement also changed. Previously, societies were almost entirely rural.

97
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Most people lived and worked on family farms, either as owners or workers.

98
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Retirement meant being supported by one's family, usually on a farm with industrialization.

99
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:44,000
More people began to live and work in cities. The challenges of aging changed,

100
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:51,000
along with the shifts in circumstances of living and working in Germany under the leadership of Otto von

101
00:11:51,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Bismarck was the first major country to institute a program of Social Insurge or old age pension system.

102
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,000
It was adopted in 1889 and the retirement age was initially set at 70.

103
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:16,000
A program for health insurance was also instituted at about the same time, and later the retirement age was lowered to 65 in the year 1916.

104
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:24,000
In the United States, soon after the return, the turn of the century, there was talk about social insurance.

105
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:31,000
But there was no significant political traction for such programs until the Great Depression during the Depression.

106
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Unemployment was very high and so was poverty, particularly among the elderly.

107
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:45,000
President Roosevelt took office in 1933, and in 1935, the Social Security Act was passed and went into effect.

108
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Recall that in 1940, the elderly dependency ratio was low.

109
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Only eleven or for every 11 people 65 and older, there were 100 working age people aged 60 to 64.

110
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
By 2020, the elderly dependency ratio had increased to 28.

111
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:13,000
In other words, there were more older people for every active worker who was paying taxes into the system.

112
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:20,000
So having examined how we ended up with 65 as the so-called standard retirement age.

113
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:28,000
What was the impact when Social Security started? And what is the impact today?

114
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Life expectancy at birth has increased substantially since nineteen hundred.

115
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
But life expectancy has also increased that all other ages.

116
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:42,000
So, for example, in 1940, among persons who survive to age 21.

117
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Only 57 percent were expected to survive to age 65.

118
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:54,000
And if they survive to 65, their life expectancy was then only thirteen point seven years.

119
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
In other words,

120
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:05,000
more than 40 percent of workers who contributed to Social Security payroll taxes in 1940 never lived long enough to receive any benefits.

121
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:16,000
And even if they did survive to 65, on average, they would only receive benefits from Social Security for thirteen point seven years.

122
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:24,000
By 2009, the numbers had changed quite a bit, first among persons who survive to age 21.

123
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Nearly 80 percent were expected to survive to age 65 and therefore become eligible to receive Social Security benefits.

124
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
And furthermore, once reaching age 65,

125
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:45,000
their life expectancy and the duration of Social Security benefits was increased 40 percent to nineteen point two years.

126
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Overall, a larger fraction of workers are now surviving long enough to become eligible to receive Social Security benefits.

127
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,000
And they are also living longer while receiving such benefits.

128
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:10,000
These changes in life expectancy are a great success, but they also represent a major challenge to the fiscal solvency of the Social Security program.

129
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:18,000
The good news is that over the last few decades, poverty rates among the elderly have declined to historically low levels.

130
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:28,000
And this success is largely due to the combined effects of a major social programs, Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.

131
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:38,000
As the population has aged and the birthrate has declined, all of the major social programs have become fiscally stressed and underfunded.

132
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,000
This fiscal stress is expected to worsen in coming decades,

133
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:53,000
as we have seen the major policy choices for addressing the fiscal challenges involved some combination of three options raising taxes,

134
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,000
decreasing eligibility and or decreasing the level of benefits.

135
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:10,479
Each of these options is controversial and faces considerable political opposition.
