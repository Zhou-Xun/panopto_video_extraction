00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:08,960
Canvas has introduced a new editor that changes how you incorporate links and other course items into your pages,

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:14,060
announcements, discussions and assignment and quiz instructions.

3
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:21,170
Let's walk through some of these changes so you can be ready as you update your core sites for the upcoming semester.

4
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:32,120
The edit tools can be found under these menus or in the row of icons below, several tools are available in both locations.

5
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:38,120
If your browser window is small, some tools may collapse under this more menu,

6
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:44,670
you can click to see them or expand your browser window if you are able.

7
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:58,410
Standard text formatting tools are available here in the first set of icons, additional text formatting options are available under the format menu.

8
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:04,650
The insert menu is where you'll find the ability to incorporate most content types,

9
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:11,690
the equation editor is also located here and in the last grouping of icons.

10
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:23,190
To insert a link, I can select the text, I want to hyperlink and go to insert link to add an external link to a Web page.

11
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:28,050
Or choose course link to add an item in the course,

12
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:34,350
a redesigned side panel will appear on the right hand side of the screen to browse through your pages,

13
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:41,870
assignments, quizzes and other items using the toggles to expand each header.

14
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:55,820
Notice your files are not included in this list to access your files, change the content type from links to files and choose Korth files.

15
00:01:55,820 --> 00:02:00,770
This will allow you to insert files already in canvas.

16
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:06,080
At the time of this recording, you're not able to upload a new file from this panel.

17
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:16,040
So we'll look at that next. You can continue to switch between files and links until you've completed all of your edits when ready,

18
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:21,380
this panel can be closed using the X in the upper right corner.

19
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:31,040
The ability to upload a new file while editing has moved to the documents option under the insert menu, while you can upload a new document here.

20
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,840
Note that you will not be able to organize it into a specific folder.

21
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,550
Canvas will create a new folder titled Uploaded Media.

22
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:50,720
If you prefer to upload documents into designated folders, you may want to visit the files area and upload items their first.

23
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:58,580
To add a file already in canvas, you can also use the court documents link to open the side panel.

24
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:11,090
It immediately displays only my documents, but again, at the top, I can switch to view other course items sought to see images or media.

25
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:20,540
Or view my file folders using the all option.

26
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:26,540
While you can upload audio and video files using the media option provided here,

27
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:34,340
we recommend using the university's my video tool or our own Panopto tool.

28
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:37,190
These work better for streaming video,

29
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:47,650
are easier to use across different semesters and offer automatic closed captioning features not available when storing media in canvas.

30
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:53,650
Access to my video or Kaltura content using the icon in the toolbar.

31
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:59,770
This is also how you would insert video you've copied from the video repository

32
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:09,470
Access Panopto from the app's icon shaped like a plug or from the tools menu.

33
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:22,620
You can see I already have Panopto listed as an option, however, you will likely need to first select it from the bottom of this list.

34
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:28,770
Lastly, you'll see this link options button up here over your links as you work,

35
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:35,550
these options primarily allow you to edit the text of the link if needed, or change the euro.

36
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:41,940
Additional options are available for files and images to make changes how they're displayed.

37
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:50,220
But for the most part, you'll need to use the insert menu to add and edit your links.

38
00:04:50,220 --> 00:05:01,718
