1
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:03,740
Right.

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:15,650
So this is kind of the last lecture before we get really stuck into things and sort of go through a few housekeeping items before you get started.

3
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:22,280
I've also come with some props to give you an idea of some of the technologies that have been developing and where we're going to go with the class.

4
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:28,700
And before I go any further, I wanted to make sure we're on the same page.

5
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:36,710
So basically it's going to appear you've got an assignment to do that's part of the discussion piece,

6
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:43,310
and that's what we're going to do in a few seconds. We will have quizzes from right here on that one exam.

7
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:49,100
Essentially, it's a midterm, and that is it. And then you have some questions about this, the homeworks.

8
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:58,490
There's two, right. And one is going to be, I think, decided on I mentioned some phase technology and the other one is your choice.

9
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:04,400
So I'm going to next time give you some information on that to give you some rethinking.

10
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:11,360
And the idea is and make sure you guys are happy with this one by saying how the first like we can and talk about things and if you're not happy,

11
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:17,230
let me know. The idea would be that I am the CEO of the company.

12
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:21,560
All right. You all senior scientists. Okay.

13
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:28,880
The idea would be that then you go out and find a technology and talk about it and it's inviting.

14
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:33,229
This advice is why it's better than something in the past. So why not this way?

15
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:35,690
Not to be lectured about all this innovation stuff?

16
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:44,690
And then you are going to basically make a report as well as your final homework on this technology and its application.

17
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:48,020
And you can actually have an application so interesting to you.

18
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:56,389
I thought is kind of cool because we've got people from pharmacy, dentistry, backgrounds, interests and health.

19
00:01:56,390 --> 00:02:01,790
Obviously hospitals, domestic want to go into medicine.

20
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,750
I thought this is a kind of a cool thing that will cater to everyone's interests.

21
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:11,030
And the idea is part of this as well as we will discuss it in the class as we go.

22
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:17,000
Does that make sense? Yeah. And maybe I haven't fully decided upon yet.

23
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:26,480
Maybe do a little presentation each. Okay. Uh, which you then take out a little bit from the final writeup school and actually park presentation.

24
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:33,160
I want to note I know some people don't like presenting, so I'm not too sure about anyone.

25
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:36,410
Emailed me with strong opinions. Let me know.

26
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:46,550
But that's what I thought the overall structure would be. I have done this before both formats basically with a um,

27
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:55,430
both related to this idea of being a um of us being the company and or developing by trying out new terminology in describing it.

28
00:02:55,790 --> 00:03:01,700
And it works really, really well. So 1st of July that idea anyone going to concerns.

29
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,600
You. Yeah. Okay.

30
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:13,670
That's the idea. It works really, really well, and it caters to everyone's interests.

31
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:20,000
And I'm actually, you know, I can give you if you get stuck, I'm more than happy to give you directions.

32
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:27,379
Um, no one is really or stuck in the past, and we've had people from undergraduate all the way through to students doing this,

33
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:30,530
and they all seem to enjoy it unless you've had really good evaluations for it.

34
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:32,450
So I thought, you know what? I would do it again.

35
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:39,019
And the only evaluation sort of comments I've had was talking to me afterwards where we didn't have standard presentation or something

36
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:46,280
like that and thrash out a lot of the ideas that we've been developing so much to show how we could do that and maybe be in some way.

37
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,030
But I'm just thinking the essay is a big piece. Does that make sense?

38
00:03:51,410 --> 00:04:00,830
I'm happy to give loads of information next lecture sites and my share on that in way in advance, because that's the other comment that was made.

39
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:06,770
I wish we had it sooner so we can really chat amongst ourselves and with me about the ideas.

40
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:12,709
So that sounds good. Okay. And then obviously the first homework is not be that particularly bad at all.

41
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:19,210
It's like I think it's spacey or on a paper and describing similar things.

42
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:26,810
So I get more questions on there than accentuating to to a to be patient stage technology I think is kind of cool.

43
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:30,260
So that's what I'm thinking about here. Okay.

44
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:37,910
So that's where we are in this now the bit for next week, I want to make sure no one's gaining share throughout this is might be fun.

45
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:44,360
Okay so if we so because you haven't seen my announcement last time so is my announcement.

46
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:50,230
Uh, but. Is it here?

47
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:54,500
Okay, so again, everybody's coming in and filtering in and out, what have you.

48
00:04:54,680 --> 00:05:01,000
Welcome to the classes, the great. You're here, and we're looking forward to this, um, and this whole description here.

49
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:05,870
I'd like to have it done by Thursday. Next week, we can sit around, shout out technologies.

50
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:11,540
Okay, but you don't any later than that, we could be covering those technologies in this class.

51
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:16,550
Does that make sense? This is kind of like you pique your interest also.

52
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:19,610
I'm hoping you will be. I think I said it in here.

53
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:25,700
The aim is for you to realize the prevalence and diversity of anti microbes in the home and discuss your findings in the class.

54
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:33,390
This should not be a laborious exercise and as we discuss, you should bring your white it with you next Thursday for a class discussion.

55
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:34,489
You can guess what I'm doing.

56
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:40,970
The basis is already making sure everyone's getting involved in class discussion because that's part of this syllabus, right?

57
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:45,830
And it's not. If you don't know much, don't worry.

58
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:49,580
That's the whole point is make us realize, oh, we don't know that much.

59
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:54,200
And actually, it makes me realize how little I know every single time I do this.

60
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:58,130
Okay. This things that some people put out on me, I've never heard this technology before.

61
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:02,840
Right? So we can actually, as a group discuss these things.

62
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:07,700
And actually it might even give you ideas for the final project at the end of the semester.

63
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:13,070
He gave me this. It's kind of like revolution things repeating yourself.

64
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:17,960
I know the last time I didn't give you a full description, so I put it in here.

65
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:21,560
Put it you're focusing on. Actually, it was a guide. Okay.

66
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,910
And you don't need to put references in if you want to get a couple of PubMed things.

67
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:31,760
Obviously, is a product information you can find in the Web, do web link to it and that kind of stuff.

68
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:38,300
If you would have made such a quick look, that's fine by me. This is more for discussion purposes, just a game.

69
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:42,889
And then we have the class stabilized and we can introduce themselves again and say, Hey, this is what I found.

70
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:47,810
And that's cool that we can say, Yeah, it's really scary or, you know, make these comments that make sense.

71
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:55,240
Okay. And this ties in with another lecture we'll be doing actually on green technology.

72
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:59,640
There is a huge push in the United States and actually in Europe as well.

73
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:03,270
Big time for green technology. Does that does that make sense?

74
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:07,270
I say green technology stuff that uses natural products.

75
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:14,530
And actually the government, the US government, federal government actually encouraged it through financial support for companies.

76
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,760
So we were talking about that as well. This makes sense.

77
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:21,790
I'm trying to do okay. Any concerns?

78
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:28,290
I will tell you now that I'm happy to answer emails. It really comes down to what you want to discuss.

79
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:36,780
Things go through Zoom as well. I'm always open to that and just let you know the weekends that I tend to be a little bit slow in responding,

80
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:42,809
I usually respond on Sunday, Saturday, usually my day off from Sunday.

81
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:46,090
You might if you something on Saturday you probably get response on Sunday morning.

82
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:49,920
I'm cooking much better that way. So does that make sense?

83
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:54,660
The week, of course. It's going to email me any day back. Urgent.

84
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:58,470
Just email me again. I am absolutely fine with you pestering me.

85
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:05,100
No, that's the wrong word by with you reminding me and I won't feel passive very often.

86
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:09,690
I say okay. And those that know me know that I'm like, that sense?

87
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:13,350
Would you get that? Yeah. So that's all good.

88
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:19,060
Okay. Any questions? Right.

89
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:29,450
Okay. So I updated the slides to see in a little bit because know there's an area where I said about blue lights and red light.

90
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:37,459
Last time I went to that mistake, so oft repeated that you now see, you know what I've done, I always emphasize I know some of the formatting went in.

91
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:47,880
The PDFs I'm hoping is back again. Um. So I talked about definitions.

92
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:54,860
And then we talked about the first sort of like big thing growing solutions.

93
00:08:55,250 --> 00:09:03,460
We talked about how this seems to be like this revolution of certain products, ethanol, and to try to send it back to ethanol again.

94
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:14,810
We talked about Coachella, which would be like, let's go to Qatar Airways and realizing how even old technologies are still being used today.

95
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:21,340
In fact, some of them are actually being increasingly used all over again. Could do this.

96
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:27,020
And here we go. Here's a mistake wall found in 87. That blue light was more toxic to bacteria than red light.

97
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:33,770
But I had blue blue that by accident. So I corrected that for you. And of course, I talked about it as people do it.

98
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:38,390
Now, all you need to know, really, for this is a bit of history. Who did what, when?

99
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:46,100
That's it. And that's important because it actually sets this your thought processes for what things are happening now.

100
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:49,580
And I want to tell you right now that technology is going at a pace.

101
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:55,490
I have a lot of experience working with companies.

102
00:09:56,780 --> 00:10:03,180
I will play my own trumpet for 2 seconds on. It's a full disclosure now, so you get an idea for next time and Thursday we start talking products.

103
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:11,149
I have been working with people directly or indirectly with SC Johnson, Johnson Johnson,

104
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:17,510
Procter and Gamble, Colgate-Palmolive, Unilever, Reckitt and Sitka Wrigley's chewing gum.

105
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:24,180
How close are companies? Right. And what these stuff make them yield patterns.

106
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:31,790
Now you see why. I'm also saying at the end of the last project we had you guys where I'm taking it into understanding

107
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:38,060
the importance of technology driving products forward and increasingly improving public health.

108
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:50,570
Um, so best way for me historical background is important because actually sometimes that older technology comes back again to haunt us, to hang on.

109
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:54,520
If we do this, Amazon is going to get better. And it sounds bonkers.

110
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:56,270
I'm not to say to act because I can't,

111
00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:06,319
but this is actually happening right now in our lab where we're using reagents for an idea that actually was characterized back in the 1960s.

112
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:12,049
And now we're like, hang on a second. They didn't do something back then, but we now know we can use it.

113
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:16,010
And it is and this is it makes sense. So history is important.

114
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:24,799
Okay. Um, that is the assignment accommodating to be clear and is in the message as well.

115
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,100
19th next week. Please don't make a big thing about it.

116
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:32,360
It is more about the discussion and obviously having a document so I can the authors

117
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:36,340
and even with your notes when you read out everyone or just read out in a place,

118
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:39,760
I don't mind. Okay, see?

119
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:47,560
Fine. Um, now, actually, I'm going to tell you about one of the things that I did in previous years with the class.

120
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:53,120
So I told the class and did one, and I chose something which you may or may not know what it's about.

121
00:11:54,350 --> 00:12:04,710
What's that? Anyone using it.

122
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:11,280
It's a complex polyphenol. Do you know what you do with that?

123
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:19,240
Some of you. I'll give you a clue. But if people knew a lot about. T.

124
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:26,580
Yup. This is actually one of the key ingredients in tea that provides an anti-microbial activity.

125
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:31,590
Think about it. Kind of ironic because what we do in TB drink and what we know for bad oral health and we drink medicine,

126
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:36,060
this is actually kind of actually good for our teeth. Yes, it does do staining as well.

127
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:42,810
But tea contains a variety of compounds that actually have the hidden health benefits.

128
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:48,190
And you could almost argue that people have been running around. It's my little joke.

129
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:52,110
Not all this is a terrible joke. We had to face storm in a teacup.

130
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:59,010
No, no. To do that. It's an English phrase. And I think I hate to the this even worse than I thought it was.

131
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:03,750
Storm. A storm in a teacup means it's much ado about nothing.

132
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:10,770
It's not a big deal. Okay. People got really concerned about sort of like what's going on with tea is intoxicated, the other activities.

133
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:15,540
And then you realize that actually it's critical for health and.

134
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:21,310
What I was thinking. It kind of ties in with the revolutionary,

135
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:29,590
the realization that there are things that we might naturally do which actually have hidden health benefits.

136
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:39,010
Okay. And I'll just proved his point on further black tea contain heavily oxidized leaves.

137
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:44,710
The case is how you prepare the T so often better than whites or green tea.

138
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:51,760
There was a lady in Africa say that she's a researcher with a nightmare.

139
00:13:52,060 --> 00:14:00,190
I'm struggling here. She was in Illinois, a prominent transplant here, but she was on CNN.

140
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:09,430
She got me first interested back in early 2000 to 2003, and she was talking to health benefits of green tea and preventing plaque buildup.

141
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,950
It actually turns out she was on the right track.

142
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:19,330
But actually black tea, which is made through its fermentation process and oxidization process, actually is even better.

143
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:24,160
And you can see this. So here's a paper on ResearchGate.

144
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,750
Groups that do this. Just try this way.

145
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:42,210
It's not work. Antibacterial activity of black T against streptococcus mutation and extension of antibiotics.

146
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:47,150
So as I said last time, people are not thinking not only is it cool, but maybe even,

147
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:51,360
you know, makes it even better with antibiotics to do things like severe tooth decay.

148
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:58,690
On a cool. Here's another one.

149
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:02,740
And this one is where you can see where my interest actually arises.

150
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:11,860
Tannic acid. Having acid is also anti okay and is actually with David Payne and blaze bold blaze those is a professor here.

151
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:24,880
Part of this initiative does Highlander and we the tannic acid present in tea actually inhibits Staphylococcus aureus and colonizing surfaces.

152
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:32,060
So you can almost imagine maybe we could take some technological ideas in the tea and use it for surface cleansing.

153
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:36,460
Because if you disrupt the biofilm and potentially enhance anti-microbial penetration.

154
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:41,440
I know she knew this house anyway and that sort of thing.

155
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,090
But technology and tying them together. Okay.

156
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:50,710
And for full disclosure, and I haven't done this until this year, but.

157
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:08,020
Even though the pandemic really messed up in my lap, it's were kind of a cool paper out disparity and I would find it.

158
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:18,810
Even when you have tea that has sucrose in it, it still has strong antibacterial, antibacterial properties.

159
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,629
And this was actually a collaboration with Constanza Fernandez.

160
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:31,890
She's a dentist in Chile. So this is a really cool study to do somehow during COVID and unconscious.

161
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:38,310
And that seems to be that he actually is a he's associate dean now in a dental school.

162
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:44,430
Okay. So pretty cool by both teams, which is spoken by myself and by him.

163
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:50,340
Architecture. Clancy had an enhanced effect that may relate to the cheeses of anti-microbial activity.

164
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:59,820
The addition of sucrose, a sugar to produce did not appear to reduce the impact of either T in modifying or bathroom architecture.

165
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:04,980
So you can have your cake and eat it. You can have your tea with your sugar.

166
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:10,410
It seems to be pretty cool now, but this is in vitro, but more studies to come.

167
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:18,480
So that's the one I would have chosen if I had to choose from calcite.

168
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:29,140
You know, a fresh start gives the idea about what you could potentially look around for, keep your mind open to what could be anti-microbial.

169
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:34,110
Even think about surfaces many of you have in your if you had a shared house, you own homes,

170
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:37,920
cutting boards and even not cutting boards have empty microbrews in them as well.

171
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:44,580
All these sort of things keep your mind open to this. And if you're not sure, email me.

172
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:49,290
Okay. So today I want to talk about physical treatment strategies.

173
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:54,690
Okay. Ways to control communities using physical treatments.

174
00:17:55,050 --> 00:18:02,400
And we are going to touch on a lot more on this in future to actually this is like laying the sound foundations, if you will, going forward.

175
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:12,700
So. So the first one is autoclaves, also referred to as Sterilizers, also known as being cookies and things like that.

176
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,200
Okay. And pressure cookers is also known as a pressure cooker.

177
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:20,590
Okay. And steam under pressure is the sterilizing agent.

178
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:26,590
Here we have spoons here. It's kind of one of my favorite to first understand.

179
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:34,850
Can we just listen here? High pressure equals steam to reach high temperatures that's increasing its heat content and killing power.

180
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:38,270
So what I'm trying to say, though, is boiling water is hot.

181
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:47,910
But what's hotter, Steve? Okay. And it's all about the latent heat of vaporization, i.e., it's going to endothermic.

182
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:51,220
So actually, the mechanism is taking all this energy,

183
00:18:51,390 --> 00:19:01,410
then form steam phase transition that resolves energy during that transition from liquid to steam and all this energy suddenly contained in.

184
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:05,760
Interesting point. I'm not a physicist. I'm trying to set in the best way that I can.

185
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:16,019
Okay. So the liquid to the gas team and the way I kind of like envision this Steve has all this extra power,

186
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:19,920
this energy, this killing potential and this fun fact which I put in bed.

187
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:26,190
Because the key to everything, 80 calories are required to make one liter of water boil.

188
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:39,440
80 calories. Energy. As opposed to 540 calories to convert the same mixture of water to boiling water to put to tip of the boiling water to steam.

189
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:45,680
Okay. You have a lot more energy in there for steam at 100 degrees.

190
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:49,460
C has almost seven times more heat than boiling water.

191
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:56,310
Seven times more. That makes sense. So when you have an ordinary surface exposed to steam.

192
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:01,620
That's way worse than to handle an issue like hot water. Okay.

193
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:05,250
And not only when you think about autoclaves, is that sort of a big thing.

194
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:09,450
We also seem to have got it under pressure. Okay.

195
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:14,330
So actually, the temperature goes higher. They wouldn't know the temperature.

196
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:18,740
Somebody should feel that glass 15. Pretty likely.

197
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:22,400
I'm 150. 120. That study that was on the exam.

198
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:28,280
I know. So. So they should be above 100 degrees because you're under pressure.

199
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:34,880
Okay. And as a consequence of that, you have this extra energy as well being put in just more than seven times.

200
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:40,370
Now, find another way of thinking about it. If you ever worked in the hospital or worked in a burn wound wards.

201
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,700
They always say steam burn is way worse than a hot water body.

202
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:47,450
So we think about how we would respond to this.

203
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:53,630
Okay. Pretty horrendous. Okay. And this is rapid shock things happening as well.

204
00:20:53,840 --> 00:21:01,430
See if culture is like a bottle of broth, a liquid broth that we have in our lab, put in the autoclave and then the steam hits it.

205
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:10,340
And it's this massive transition of heat. That's why we've got to use things like pirate glass, tempered glass, and then we have super huge change.

206
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:16,280
Okay. This causes coagulation of proteins and nature of macromolecules, the whole of whole thing.

207
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:19,280
Just basically. So just pop because of this effect.

208
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:26,570
Nothing survives. Okay. I even sport sports how even surviving to this is done correctly.

209
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,410
Now autoclaves come in all shapes and sizes. Have you seen the autoclave in the past?

210
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:37,190
Have you one? Yes. No. No. Yes.

211
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,790
Maybe some knows what they look like here.

212
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:45,860
Interested? I'm happy to do a little toward the lab and show what's going on.

213
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:52,070
Oh, are you talking about dental school? So I've heard back from the dean's office and watch this space.

214
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:56,719
What little future of their lives at another person.

215
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,330
And hopefully they'll say yes. So I'll be more fortunate.

216
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:08,470
But part of that trip, if we do it, will be showing you some of their things they had and they have huge roll on, roll off of his legs.

217
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:11,950
Bit like this one here. Okay. Way bigger.

218
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:15,590
And the door, one side, the door, the other side stepping on one side,

219
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:22,950
the door shuts you all to close the press on the other side to open the door, takes you to say stuff out and gets you prepared for treatment.

220
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:29,540
Supposing that if you so you in surgeries or in the hospital in a dental clinic as well.

221
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:38,420
But those are big ones. Yes, like smaller ones. We have this one in our lab where you can hold probably under ten liters of fluid.

222
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:43,729
And we'll say that you have these ones that I used to have a lot of mice my first I've been recently,

223
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:47,240
Paulson and Craig is a small unit essentially like this hand build up.

224
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:55,670
You open the door, you put your samples any closer and you set the timer, set the temperature and so forth, and off you go.

225
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,560
And there's more modern units here, as was shown, is when you put down into units,

226
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:08,329
this one actually you might see at home or more likely in a something like a tattoo parlor.

227
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:11,450
I know that this is more akin to a pressure cooker.

228
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:15,860
And of course, you should mention as well, you have some of these little weeds that weed out.

229
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:21,110
So that's useful to think about this for a second. It's not think about regulations.

230
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:26,030
If you are in a hospital or you are in a dental clinic and you're doing all this work.

231
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:32,420
And by the way, I'm just telling you right now is medical practice and probably a case study that we're going to be talking about.

232
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:38,120
You don't have the correct facilities that print to document what you've done.

233
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:43,370
You might miss things like incomplete autoclave cycles and therefore be introduced and not sterilized.

234
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:47,360
Okay. It's good to have these readouts and these documentations.

235
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:53,900
And of course, I'm guessing now I'm not change this late the last couple of years,

236
00:23:54,230 --> 00:24:02,240
but I'm pretty sure now we have probably digital variations where you have USB stick, so we find documents and things as well.

237
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:07,220
I like the hard hardcopy stuff. I'm not going to use this to react.

238
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,760
And then you should get really, really, really ridiculously scary.

239
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:14,450
This thing you could walk and see is happy doing it shut behind you.

240
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:19,310
That is a war game or today where you put a huge items.

241
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:23,870
Okay, don't ask me what because I've been thinking on both of you what would be super huge that you'd

242
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:29,689
want to autoclave and anything I can think of of things like using in semiconductor industry.

243
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:34,219
So you'd want to have clean rooms, whether it makes manufacturing chips.

244
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:38,870
So my guess is we would use these sort of items to sterilize big items if we weapons of the.

245
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:45,410
And, you know, ideas because I don't when I started when I came up with. So there you go.

246
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:50,230
I mean, of course, thing is, you would do mass bulk water cleaning of waste and stuff like that.

247
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:54,700
I sort of thought, there you go. I.

248
00:24:55,850 --> 00:25:04,640
Okay. So 115 is the lower end, 121 is the optimum temperature and typically is round about 15.

249
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:12,200
So it becomes ten. So you can get super high as well and 32 degrees C at 27.

250
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:15,770
So it was a piece like good point, pounds per square inch as the pressure.

251
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:26,090
Okay. And the big thing to remember is the more volume to treat, really, the longer you should autoplay for, the more aggressive you should be.

252
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:32,280
Why? Because the bigger the volume, the steam is going to have to take longer to heat in the cool.

253
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:36,470
Okay. To transfer that energy to the core. So it is a big volume of liquid.

254
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:42,530
The outside might become sterile geologically, but the core will not.

255
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:49,280
So then when you take that volume out is eager, for example, of golf within a day of be contaminated.

256
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:56,310
Okay. And this is often so disregarded, forgotten about me.

257
00:25:56,330 --> 00:26:05,800
But I do know the people and the people. And so it just following what we read and so they don't think that the volumes they're using now.

258
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:09,770
Is it a little definition for you? This is what kind of important.

259
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:17,420
When you think about the effectiveness of killing, we refer to this as the sum or death time,

260
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:24,800
and this is the time required to kill a known population of micrograms in a specific suspension at a particular temperature.

261
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:31,250
So my point is we feel a thermal death time. Think about the type of micrograms you're looking at.

262
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:36,440
There's cell density and the type and volume of liquid that you're trying to treat.

263
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:45,080
Okay, more volume, longer time. What makes sense setting over there like that might form spores could be taking longer to kill.

264
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:49,250
So we tend to have guidelines.

265
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:55,699
If it had been especially dangerous, opens Priscilla some places of homeschooling, for example.

266
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:59,659
That's not good to how we actually autoclave things.

267
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:04,670
And this all relates to the thermal death time and that's a really important definition.

268
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:09,020
Okay. There's lots of parameters here as an asset. Okay.

269
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:11,010
And I was going through some thought processes,

270
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:18,950
all the orgs in the same way that I can dispense packaging is the same SEM items easy and the scopes cannot withstand single repeated autoclave.

271
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:25,500
I said, that's a good point. So and this goes within the scope.

272
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:29,839
Just me. You get to an older age, you get to know when to do it.

273
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,860
And the scope is. I'm getting that out.

274
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:38,390
Well, I'm looking forward to it. But anyway, the point is that out loud.

275
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:41,419
So and in this tape, of course,

276
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:47,520
the example gets put places depending on which type of thing you're thinking about and would you really want that globalized thing to be jacket,

277
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:55,550
you know. And of course an all basically I would do that it would cause the rubber to temper and basically become

278
00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:03,020
an asteroid and break down the many items you do go into how one looking to become very comfortable,

279
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:07,160
but also it would hold microorganisms in between the cracks and so forth.

280
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:10,720
Okay. I don't get to an alternative for that in a second.

281
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:18,560
Okay. You know, I've that going to say, but I don't know what's in the slides following and those one should be sterilize we gassed evidence

282
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:26,480
softer is not heat but it's a terrible chemical which I mentioned last time in a few minutes.

283
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:29,800
Okay. Um. No.

284
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:37,430
However, an author the jokes aside, when proper conditions in time employ no living organisms,

285
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:44,930
spores and those 4000 cells, nothing will survive in autoclave treatment for long, long as it's done properly.

286
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:50,910
Okay. Okay. Any questions so far?

287
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:58,610
Okay. And we will cover all this in future.

288
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:07,520
But I think that like now preparation is everything. You want to make sure the chief example, I'm not going to just give the absolute extreme here.

289
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:15,350
I can remember when someone started in my lab a long time ago and I said didn't really appreciate what was coming on.

290
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:23,209
They were pretty junior and they just kind of buckling of wolf into the oil slick stuff.

291
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:26,780
They didn't even set the time correctly. It was a lease and they set it for the next 5 minutes.

292
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:30,620
And no, that's not going to work. And the second thing was, they didn't put any autoclave tables.

293
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:34,580
They didn't have to be in order to come in and get that in. Second and third of all, they left the lid off.

294
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:41,330
So whatever happened, it wouldn't have worked. Okay. So first and foremost, you make sure you put the packaging together properly.

295
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:50,750
You see samples there. You know, oftentimes in the dental office, in the hospital, you have patches where East Instrument can then be purchased.

296
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:53,900
And of course, when you autoclave it, that means when you take it out,

297
00:29:53,930 --> 00:30:00,110
each item you can open at your own choice, at your own time, and the mistakes sterile until you open it.

298
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:07,670
Okay. The other thing is we use basically a jack Super Bowl and this was some of the sides of it.

299
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,980
It has banding. And those bands basically change color from transparent silicon,

300
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:17,990
whitish color to a different kind of color, depending on what type of material it is used in there.

301
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:24,170
But eventually the change is color designed to do so in the high heat iron based compounds,

302
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:30,890
often using the old days you see hidden from black residue has been oxidized by the high heat and steam.

303
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:41,080
Okay, so you go from before which you go on your hands to an ultra cold water cure that fill it perfectly.

304
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:46,670
They don't have anything, you know, if my laptop's getting hot, you know, remember the glass.

305
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:55,130
I think it took more heat than that. And and you see this transition from one to the other.

306
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:59,000
I can see what you see that you know, that that lighting is being able to take.

307
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:06,860
Okay. Right. Any plan to get off the role of gloves on?

308
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:11,240
Yes. So your gloves alternative these things out? Yes.

309
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:16,080
How do you view in engrams right now? Through it.

310
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,750
How many of you have gone to the east end of the year left or to in the program,

311
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:25,050
reprogram you in two or three or even a year if this is your final year?

312
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:28,610
Well, my first year. The first year. Okay. So here's a quick question for you.

313
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,640
If you had an interest in working in the lab,

314
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:39,340
I'm actually looking around for potentially one H in exchange or a master's student broadly and maybe one or two undergraduates.

315
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:44,050
So if you're interested, we can talk about later on, but I'll put that one out there now.

316
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:49,570
This concept is interesting, you and microbiology in general and sterilization and antimicrobials.

317
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:54,820
I just remember I need to say this because we was mentioning projects that are developing.

318
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:02,470
So feel free to reach out. And uh, by the end of class today or via email, we have a chat.

319
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:06,820
That's my brief interlude. This bit of advertising we're doing in the lab. Anyway, moving on.

320
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:11,230
So the author case is the Sterilize Sterilizes fun, basically.

321
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:15,220
Um. I love these slides. I'm sorry. Don't be.

322
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:20,490
Don't take it in the first place. Really makes mistakes in the lab alone.

323
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:28,509
Automatic change it kind of after exposure to extreme temperatures strips applied to eyes and reported leaving dates time item lot numbers

324
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:37,479
name of deposit to use you to listen on to the autoclave tape as well to use high tech instrument a sharpie obviously not the sharpie.

325
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:42,550
That is the one that's water soluble, a permanent one. You write songs, the tape will be information.

326
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:49,000
You stick it to the bottle, you ought to save it. And then, you know, when the whole thing was processed and you know that it was processed.

327
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:55,330
Okay. And you just saw composition is similar to masking tape, a slightly more sticky adhesive.

328
00:32:55,430 --> 00:33:02,919
She made us demonstrate to this laptop and basically typically is an oxidizing reaction iron or Simpson metal mark that changes

329
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:11,950
color and of course big thing I should put here put my I'm in the I'm involved with the idea of health and safety things on campus.

330
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:18,490
So I should make sure I always make sure that the environmental health and safety rules are in place as well if you're doing waste.

331
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:23,540
Any questions? Okay.

332
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:26,100
This one I selected.

333
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:32,159
This wasn't in the previous slide like that because I was thinking about this last night and I woke up in the middle of the night and as you do,

334
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:39,629
it gained traction. I missed that one out. So all these years I didn't think about filtration and so I quickly put some slides together.

335
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:49,110
And so this one here I did about 430 this morning, as you do.

336
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:53,870
I wasn't watching good ones anyway. So what is which were were filtration?

337
00:33:53,880 --> 00:34:04,920
Well early observations are foul water packaging soil and gravel we were would notice to give spring like water so we have bottles of water.

338
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:12,000
Perrier for example I think is a really posh one. Basically though, these early observations and this is all based on the idea that, well,

339
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,470
what is spring water in spring water effectively is water has gone through the soil.

340
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:24,660
Contaminants are being removed by binding to the organic components in the soil as well as the microorganisms that are not pathogenic.

341
00:34:24,990 --> 00:34:28,410
Breaking down things and pesticides,

342
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:37,500
nox noxious chemicals and people notice this and you know hundreds of years ago

343
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:44,490
and this led to two kinds of filters being constructed based on this observation.

344
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:55,230
And the first is by Chamberlain and the second was by and Chamberlain actually used to work with Pasteur, you know, had a Pasteur like pasteurization.

345
00:34:55,530 --> 00:35:04,470
So this happened in every summer in the late 1800s, people realizing this microorganisms, these tiny little things, and they can cause these issues.

346
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:07,710
And water contamination was one of them.

347
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:18,240
And so he basically developed an idea that used permeable ice and he would actually keep it from his unclear used force.

348
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:23,820
Okay. So if you're seeing courses in China, that's not material.

349
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:27,450
It's typically glazed, smooth ice. That's been these glazed.

350
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:34,740
He didn't use that. He just knew straight out no sort of porcelain that is actually porous and high pressure.

351
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:42,060
It's not glazed and it's thin enough. Fluid can go through 600 pores going through the course.

352
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:50,610
It's actually, you know, and the high pressure essentially a filter and so that he actually that and realized this

353
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:57,640
and develops the butterfly filter which essentially is the tap with water going in and

354
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:03,059
you have pressure going through it goes into this piece here is inside the actual metal

355
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:12,070
casing and the water then comes out and the water is being filtered through this this,

356
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:17,700
this, this porcelain. It's the microbes are left inside the unit where they're under the pressure.

357
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:25,620
They start dying as water as well. And then the component capacity, the metal back to the sound won't be going will be causing disease.

358
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:28,140
So you're essentially purifying water.

359
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:36,180
This is huge, especially you think about your life in cities and have access to streams and fresh running water.

360
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:45,749
This was a way to actually filter water. And actually it's now being talk about revolution being used again today in a similar concept.

361
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:49,030
What for? I don't know.

362
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:54,060
Like the they play, like people do hiking and everything, you know?

363
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:59,370
You know, because what I do is I try to say and they call me like I just thinking.

364
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:02,890
So they also have, like, the ones you pump through a filter.

365
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:08,760
Yeah, like. Like that. Like that. That's exactly like a CamelBak filter or something like that.

366
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:17,790
And yet these people, this is really cool. New technology. I actually history in action like this has been around for a long time.

367
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:22,320
Just reinventing the wheel. Things to be speaking.

368
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:24,780
Okay. Um, and.

369
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:33,960
But either way, then this then led to the many new technologies, thought processes, and we actually even use it in the lab today very often.

370
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:37,290
So I'll pass the companies around with a big bag of them.

371
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:42,569
Uh, we actually used the same idea. Okay, well, you have a piece of material on this case.

372
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:47,520
There's a bit of nylon in here. Okay? You pass fluid through the top, through a syringe.

373
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:49,649
Okay? It might be contaminated microorganisms.

374
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:56,430
And what comes out the bottom is free of those microorganisms because it's basically been filtered through to the bottom picture here.

375
00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:00,720
These red balls of the bacteria heads to a filter.

376
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:04,170
This can be this material. All is very fine.

377
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:08,610
That's how fine. Now, can we put it down, too? I was sure you should blow your mind.

378
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:19,150
Feel free to pass this lot of that fine.

379
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:26,800
I do history here. It's like, Oh, there's nothing in it.

380
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:31,600
So there's actually a large filter there and a smaller version and offset around.

381
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:38,430
So we've actually miniaturized the whole process and we even know the poor size like that one.

382
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:43,450
There is 0.22 microns. Tiny, right.

383
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:48,460
Average size of a bacterium, about 1 to 2 microns. It's not going to get to that.

384
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:52,440
Okay. So it passes around the membrane.

385
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,870
You're playing my you look at it is so, so, so fine. Okay.

386
00:38:56,530 --> 00:39:00,160
So we go to this clumsy thing all the way down and out is fine, too.

387
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:07,150
And that's why I think like the life tools of making that point changing but really refine the process.

388
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:17,440
Okay. So the initial sort of find back in 1884 and now back with this is still in use and actually being enhanced nowadays.

389
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:23,310
Isn't that cool? You can see why I was I was going through my my mind,

390
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:28,700
not going to really emphasize the points like the matrix and evolution of the matrix having happened.

391
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:34,050
They went over again. What's happened in the past year will happen again, like the matrix.

392
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:38,970
But the point is it's doing the same in this field, controlling microorganisms.

393
00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:45,690
Okay. I definitely would like you to have a quick look at who this.

394
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:55,540
Website, though. It's a quick look at this particular list.

395
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:59,670
Have a look at it. It's very short. It shows if you don't, you show.

396
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:05,830
But this diagram here, what it took me and I'm sure I cited it. There's another example here, too, showing here's the pressure.

397
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:12,160
This is the device she was going on and that is the output here.

398
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:16,770
And I think he to get big as. Pastor Chamberlain.

399
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:18,660
There you go. And actually,

400
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:25,860
that that made people realize this thing smaller than bacteria that can cause problems like these toxins that are produced by microorganisms.

401
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:31,100
Okay. So definitely have a look at this. It's easy to read several beans.

402
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:34,439
Pretty cool and blow your mind a little bit. Okay.

403
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:38,280
And if you're not sure about how the mechanism actually works this, but you don't really have to read.

404
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:45,210
It's a bit more laborious. It's a seven minute video in there, I believe I actually it to you.

405
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:55,340
But it just makes you cement the idea that you could have that person who traces an interesting sterilization method in the.

406
00:40:56,330 --> 00:41:00,650
Yeah. It's essential to have both sides here.

407
00:41:02,330 --> 00:41:08,030
That's why I got that image from and you can see here and there's cut offs here, so you can go really, really low.

408
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:14,780
What we're talking about right now is microfiltration with a medium, medium to limit ultra filtration.

409
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:19,610
This video, if you're interested, there's a device you just handling right now.

410
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:24,720
Okay, there's a syringe. Yeah.

411
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:34,120
Okay. I don't have a habit of even had this kind of information in basketball.

412
00:41:34,330 --> 00:41:39,180
My preaching is open, but actually it's all new to. Okay.

413
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:44,930
Okay. Okay.

414
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:50,160
So let's move on from that. We talked about labor, transportation.

415
00:41:50,790 --> 00:42:01,279
I mentioned with Dorsett leaving the, um. Obviously it would seem like and I see you cheaper the gas and I mentioned it actually last

416
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:06,890
election briefly and the gas I was talking about is ethylene oxide also referred to as oxidant.

417
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:12,410
Okay. This is a heavily controlled substance.

418
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:16,339
It is a major weapon of mass. It could be used weapon.

419
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:21,140
It could be used as a weapon of mass destruction. Yes. Actually, it could be exceedingly toxic.

420
00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:27,380
Just even repeating. No contact with living on that material.

421
00:42:27,410 --> 00:42:32,300
Okay. Extremely strong alkylating properties.

422
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:40,910
It causes an immediate contact coagulation of proteins, deactivation of enzymes and other biologically relevant components.

423
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:47,420
You do not want to expose to this, and because of that there are obvious concerns with the use and strict guidelines.

424
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:55,819
And that is why we didn't get back to the seventies and eighties.

425
00:42:55,820 --> 00:43:04,100
People were having no hospitals had these and a lot of dental potentially dental clinics and universities had them as well.

426
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:11,060
But there's been a increasing concern about their use for accidents, obviously misuse.

427
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:15,590
And there's obviously a requirement for permits now.

428
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:18,830
Just just very in-depth regulation.

429
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:23,800
And that was why we only have one unit left on campus.

430
00:43:23,870 --> 00:43:27,710
So with the medical, dental, school ones being shut down. Okay.

431
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:32,030
Um, and anything is really fine. Needs to be done. Is taking them to med school.

432
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:39,800
Do you have any at all? Thank you. So none of them at school, but I know at Michigan Medicine, they actually don't use ethylene oxide anymore.

433
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:41,720
So I don't know if they're still using it and that's a problem.

434
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:49,340
So it's interesting that they're now announced and they just said that this had happened during COVID, that we got an outside source.

435
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:57,440
They said they did. But I think I think you're right. I think because we did a tour of the decontamination lab for swabbing.

436
00:43:57,770 --> 00:44:02,899
When was that semester? This year. Okay. My batch is in Texas.

437
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:07,340
So pre-COVID. That school was the last building last week.

438
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:10,160
And you have this clearly that's not changed you more.

439
00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:17,210
So my bet is it's now an outside service that does it under control conditions, whatever it may be.

440
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:22,940
And thank you. I mean, if I can change my story a little bit to make it more extreme, they don't.

441
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:26,450
You said it didn't. The medical school is the last building standing. There isn't a building.

442
00:44:26,450 --> 00:44:35,269
No abuse on campus anymore. So yeah but it does kill onan virus bacteria can spores and fungi and it's very good against material

443
00:44:35,270 --> 00:44:42,709
it can't autoclave rubbers obviously the rubber lives then after like that it also actually become

444
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:51,230
cracked and efficient and so it's good to hold good for Australia more sensitive instruments I don't

445
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:56,300
know will happen now I think PBS in a bizarre thing but autoclave claimable sensitive instruments.

446
00:44:56,870 --> 00:45:01,830
Um. Obviously annual safety inspections.

447
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:07,890
And there are a number of companies like to hear the picture from their website showing the units.

448
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:11,210
And they're not these big monstrosity of units. They can actually be fairly small.

449
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:16,410
You put the cartridge of the gas and that intrigues the material you want in it in a lot.

450
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:24,079
Unit. Sealed unit. Okay. Physical treatments.

451
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:24,890
What else are you talking about?

452
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:35,240
Well, there's also when you start thinking about stuff light and obviously part of life has been part of the electromagnetic spectrum.

453
00:45:35,690 --> 00:45:43,280
And a couple of things that have really gained interest over the years is ultraviolet X-rays and gamma rays.

454
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:49,460
Okay. This would be touch on and off to my class, but I want to put this up here so we're all aware.

455
00:45:49,580 --> 00:46:01,550
Okay. So you have increasing energy required on the right hand side and the wavelength obviously diminishes going to the right hand side as well.

456
00:46:02,330 --> 00:46:05,600
And so you have greater penetration into things. Okay.

457
00:46:05,990 --> 00:46:11,960
And potentially damage. So let's go to a key one, and that is radiation.

458
00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:21,559
Okay. And that's what we want to focus on. What you mentioned blue light UV before, but radiation is high energy, ionizing radiation,

459
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:26,240
which destroys microorganisms and is used to sterilize prepackaged surgical equipment.

460
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:32,360
This actually can be expanded further. So I was not going to watch it, but I will say it and then I'll remind you later.

461
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:37,480
It's also becoming very big now for foods.

462
00:46:38,490 --> 00:46:42,030
Okay. Believe it or not, a lot of food is now being irradiated.

463
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:47,160
Even heard of this. Well, I wouldn't have the would do a symbol.

464
00:46:48,030 --> 00:46:53,400
No, I think you you might see some of your packaged foods on symbol and everything about it.

465
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:58,020
What we would do is do it basically means if it was irradiated, we'll get that later.

466
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:03,820
No, it's not dangerous. Example, spices.

467
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:08,870
How did you stabilize places? Become solution, right?

468
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:15,530
So this is where mediation comes into play, saying it's full of materials we use in the lab and in the hospitals.

469
00:47:15,830 --> 00:47:21,180
It's hard to water. Clay is hard to autoclave. We can actually irradiated.

470
00:47:21,230 --> 00:47:27,590
So those that have worked in labs before or been in a lab class where you're given like plastic tubes that is sterile,

471
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:35,980
the lid on the sterile not because they were autoclaves, but they were radiated back into the company, sterilized by heat or chemicals.

472
00:47:36,290 --> 00:47:42,709
Radiation sterilization has been permitted so to survive when attentive to ethylene oxide, eto.

473
00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:45,740
Sterilization. Okay, it doesn't have a mass.

474
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:51,979
The concern regarding the gas escaping, but of course it's radioactive material.

475
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:59,540
You have to use irradiated. That has another concern. Okay. Also Caddy's be taken because not all materials can be irradiated successfully.

476
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:06,850
So. If you're Clark Kent from Superman and you also know about biology in general, you know,

477
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:15,730
things that might have led are actually really hard to do X-ray vision or you're treated with X-rays of radiation, hard to penetrate.

478
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:22,360
So if you have items that you want to see, sterilize, that have like, you know, through this use to get to my head.

479
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:23,980
Yeah, I'm thinking of electron microscopes.

480
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:30,640
Ironically, you have led shielding that you want to autoclave really sterilize autoclave in probably the way forward.

481
00:48:30,670 --> 00:48:33,850
Not using radiation, obviously. Okay.

482
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:39,729
Currently used by manufacturers but not used in veterinary hospitals.

483
00:48:39,730 --> 00:48:52,210
Um, it is used, has been used in passing some hospitals, but it's primarily, um, uh, manufacturers to have a particular license to do this stuff.

484
00:48:52,570 --> 00:48:56,110
Common source of radiation using electron beam and cobalt 60.

485
00:48:56,290 --> 00:49:01,360
Okay. These are basically types of where you can create radiation.

486
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:07,480
In the case of cobalt, 60 has a half life of about five point Tuesday about 5.27 years.

487
00:49:07,870 --> 00:49:16,120
Um and that had mixed gamma radiation. Now before you thinking of what kinds of radiation are there out there I broke it down for you.

488
00:49:16,450 --> 00:49:20,829
So let's have a look at this. There's Alpha Theta, Gamma Alpha.

489
00:49:20,830 --> 00:49:24,040
These are fast moving helium atoms in the form of radiation.

490
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:29,810
They have high energy, but due to large mass, it is a few inches of paper or a piece of paper.

491
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:33,280
So not too much worry there.

492
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:42,400
Obviously, if you were to drink that solution of radiation, that's very significant said altogether, data radiation, these are fast moving electrons.

493
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:46,330
So moving from helium atoms to make smaller units.

494
00:49:46,330 --> 00:49:51,969
Now electrons since electrons are lighter than helium atoms can penetrate further through

495
00:49:51,970 --> 00:49:57,880
several feet of air or several millimeters of plastic or less of even light metals.

496
00:49:58,210 --> 00:50:04,300
Okay. And of course, the extreme is gamma. These are folk songs.

497
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:08,380
If you don't like light x, X-rays and gamma rays are really the same thing.

498
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:13,150
It's classic, the same thing. The image is how they were produced.

499
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:22,420
Depending on the energy, they can be stoked by a thin piece of aluminum or aluminum or they can penetrate many inches of net.

500
00:50:23,130 --> 00:50:32,010
Okay. And so really that sums up alpha, beta.

501
00:50:32,010 --> 00:50:36,360
Gamma. Okay. Paper, aluminum letter. Okay.

502
00:50:36,870 --> 00:50:41,220
Gamma is the best. Okay. Depending on the gamma source, of course.

503
00:50:42,910 --> 00:50:50,170
Okay. Any questions? You want to do it?

504
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:58,500
Okay. Ulrich has a briefing on Grand Prix greatest machinery and various things on thermal plasma.

505
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:03,450
Ultraviolet light actually causes damage to DNA.

506
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:08,520
How does it do it? It causes demoralization between the TS and DNA.

507
00:51:08,670 --> 00:51:17,700
So you have a t thymine demise and that basically created a bubbles in the DNA and that can mess up replication.

508
00:51:18,690 --> 00:51:23,760
Transcription cell cycle. Okay. Resulting in cell death.

509
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:31,880
Sort of chickens home quickly actually noticing that might. Yeah, that's right.

510
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:41,090
To lose the ultimate. Okay. Now, some up and comers you mentioned this last time and I just a little preview to this.

511
00:51:41,130 --> 00:51:50,990
Um, we're thinking about novel ways to treat things plasma cold, non thermal plasma or cool plasma.

512
00:51:51,670 --> 00:51:58,190
And I mentioned it last time when I saw your faces and I thinking, I know I'm glad to be sliding in my thinking about this.

513
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:01,730
You've always seen these things, right? The shops. That's plasma.

514
00:52:02,090 --> 00:52:07,550
Okay. Uh, plasma essentially is the match of us.

515
00:52:07,830 --> 00:52:11,630
Yeah, it's designed to find matches. Not liquids, not gas.

516
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:23,870
Um, it's basically kind of gaseous body, but it's basically a solution, if you will, of electrons and ions that inactivate pathogens.

517
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:31,460
Okay. And you can produce about lives here wasting electrical discharge under a certain type of gas, if you will.

518
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:38,540
So in an inert gas like nitrogen or argon, with a little bit of oxygen.

519
00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:43,020
And when you do, that reignites it. It creates this pillow.

520
00:52:43,610 --> 00:52:45,880
And that's the thing you're seeing going to.

521
00:52:45,890 --> 00:52:55,240
SCHULTZ But you also have a device and this current investigations, they're looking at how potentially what we saw, again,

522
00:52:55,430 --> 00:53:00,140
we know it has anti-microbial properties because it oxidizes things, um,

523
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:06,200
and it's been looked at right now for dental applications, treating wounds and so and so forth.

524
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:12,080
And this is actually been that by a gentleman at Queen's College, Belfast.

525
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:17,150
Graydon Dunsmore and I do a lot of work on this right now,

526
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:24,980
which has great applications beyond just simple solutions, anti-microbial swabbing solutions for treating things.

527
00:53:25,550 --> 00:53:31,490
Okay. So we will be talking more about this later on, but this is produced through an electrical discharge resource.

528
00:53:31,490 --> 00:53:39,380
So, by the way, creates UV. So this thing that comes out, yes, it is safe.

529
00:53:39,670 --> 00:53:46,260
Okay. Full disclosure, which means that I can developing to this as well. A few years ago, we were trying to create a handheld version.

530
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:52,400
We got beaten to it and essentially the same idea.

531
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:58,879
You you can basically have this wound in is actually reduce the number of bacteria

532
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:04,550
by orders of magnitude from 100 down to ten or ten down to one within 30 seconds.

533
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:10,550
Just really affecting other up and comers I thought I'd like to talk about and this is all

534
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:14,690
have given some purpose as well to make you realize I know that I said the beginning.

535
00:54:15,410 --> 00:54:20,090
Okay, at the end you have these new technologies and new technology.

536
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:26,150
You'll be blown away about the technologies that are out there. This one even had a shot at technology.

537
00:54:27,750 --> 00:54:31,390
This is cool. So again member it's nothing anti micro.

538
00:54:31,410 --> 00:54:36,390
We can be controller Michael you jump in many Michael things do they bind to surfaces.

539
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:40,670
Okay. Um so, um.

540
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:46,240
What happens if you make a surface to separate? Right now.

541
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:52,270
Has anyone ever seen a shark covered in barnacles or a shark covered in seaweed?

542
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:59,170
Nope. And that's because it's not by a phone number I showed at the beginning about the conversations and how they discovered

543
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:04,360
they use copper and patch to prevent the biofilm from performing on the ships mentioned in the phone calls,

544
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:08,979
the seaweed from attaching the ships going really, really fast, the water expansion.

545
00:55:08,980 --> 00:55:14,680
And then one of those ships, a shark. And that is because they are covered in fouling either.

546
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:21,730
And that casual observation wasn't made until about eight, nine years ago.

547
00:55:22,870 --> 00:55:28,990
And it was a group down in Florida. They're like, what is that? When shops said, catch the shark, good for them.

548
00:55:29,830 --> 00:55:35,560
And they did it. And the natural microscope and this is what they saw.

549
00:55:36,590 --> 00:55:39,720
And this is at a ridiculously high magnification.

550
00:55:39,740 --> 00:55:44,600
If you look at a bacterium who's on this, you're to go back to your fabric.

551
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:48,530
Okay. Kind of stick with these ridges effectively. No.

552
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:55,010
So they're like, hang on. Bacteria attach themselves firmly to the surfaces.

553
00:55:55,340 --> 00:56:02,150
And therefore, that's why we don't see that happening. So then they went to a Nanofabrication lab and said, hey, go to something like this.

554
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:05,490
Then I have to make something like this. And we tested it.

555
00:56:05,810 --> 00:56:09,830
And lo and behold, bacteria cannot attach to their surfaces.

556
00:56:11,370 --> 00:56:19,060
Okay. So now, Matthew, the thing is shock, this kind of original shock technology that prevents attachment.

557
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:25,170
Why is that big thing. Okay. Um, would be desensitize it.

558
00:56:25,170 --> 00:56:29,520
In the US population and in many populations the world is aging.

559
00:56:30,410 --> 00:56:33,470
Okay. As you get older, things go wrong.

560
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:37,790
An example would be hip replacements, knee replacement.

561
00:56:38,390 --> 00:56:43,010
What is a big problem about those being contaminated microorganisms resulting

562
00:56:43,010 --> 00:56:46,400
in having that device removed and have the whole thing done all over again?

563
00:56:47,730 --> 00:56:54,150
And what happens, though, if it can't get contaminated to think about the pain,

564
00:56:54,210 --> 00:56:59,070
suffering, the cost, the time that you could eliminate if that didn't happen.

565
00:56:59,310 --> 00:57:09,420
And we're talking between one and 10% of all the media outlets that went before this technology, you know, effectively controlling them.

566
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:13,680
That causes news to come from communities in the sense Barcelona.

567
00:57:13,860 --> 00:57:15,810
And therefore this could be a way for.

568
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:25,290
I mean, I didn't see what other folks thinking about new ways to prevent biofilms attaching to surfaces of pipes.

569
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:35,260
All right. Also things. So to translate your thoughts into other areas, other technologies, um,

570
00:57:36,250 --> 00:57:41,889
amino acid technology using some amino acids has been shown to change the composition.

571
00:57:41,890 --> 00:57:47,120
In fact, even the name of penetration of antimicrobials into biofilms.

572
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:54,160
So you have saliva, you have arginine mixed in that makes the bottom fall apart and changing and changing composition.

573
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:57,100
Okay, so that's another thing. Okay.

574
00:57:58,540 --> 00:58:09,300
Prebiotics So you had a probiotics that's using a one heard about adding an organism to enhance our health which are more that way.

575
00:58:09,310 --> 00:58:15,790
So having an organism liking yogurt to an iron alongside gut health prebiotics are compounds

576
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:24,340
that actually encourage the gut microorganisms to grow and discourage the bad organisms.

577
00:58:24,730 --> 00:58:31,870
Does that make sense to you? It's a bit like using a fertilizer in a field that is good for wheat, but not good for weeds.

578
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:37,750
That makes sense. This is automotive nutraceuticals.

579
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:46,400
Okay so prebiotics the isn't really bizarre stuff happening in the last few the last decade.

580
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:53,600
Prebiotics work recognize that first and then they were regulated with the use of the word simple and strong.

581
00:58:53,610 --> 00:58:59,630
So we're not going to use the word prebiotic work on nutraceuticals instead and that's how that word came about as well.

582
00:58:59,660 --> 00:59:02,950
But they are interchangeable. Nishant.

583
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:06,440
This is a really interesting molecule that we're catching on this.

584
00:59:06,830 --> 00:59:18,530
This is actually produced by microorganisms and it's a short peptide, if you will, and it actually it has anti-microbial effects.

585
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:23,570
It was first discovered in cheese in the 1950s, and now we're realizing, oh,

586
00:59:23,570 --> 00:59:30,440
we could potentially use in all sorts of things to control infections as well as potentially using mouthwash and toothpaste.

587
00:59:31,070 --> 00:59:34,100
So this is another thing that I think that we're going to be talking about.

588
00:59:34,610 --> 00:59:39,920
BACTERIOPHAGE I've already mentioned that, and I think that's the one we're going to do the first assay and work on.

589
00:59:40,850 --> 00:59:48,170
And then the other thing I started talking about was quorum sensing modifiers.

590
00:59:49,010 --> 00:59:55,220
I don't know. Anyone know of quorum sensing? Raise your hand if you've heard of one before.

591
00:59:55,430 --> 01:00:00,110
You guys know, Oh, you're in for a bit of a mind explosion.

592
01:00:01,050 --> 01:00:07,700
Um, I'll tell you what. We're going to. I'm going to tell you in the next couple of weeks, but actually, my colleagues talk to each other.

593
01:00:09,390 --> 01:00:13,350
So you've heard of it? I think that it's actually the last class they played in my lifetime.

594
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:15,560
And when you guys got them, I showed you what's going on.

595
01:00:15,830 --> 01:00:20,990
So we should really mind you seeing that the bulk of the bobtail squid, the squid that close in the dog.

596
01:00:21,830 --> 01:00:28,700
Yes, maybe Dominican Republic, because you've got the squid that close that thing and the sand.

597
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:32,610
No, you didn't. You know, we had bioluminescence.

598
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:38,210
Yeah. So that's something to the bioluminescence. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

599
01:00:38,220 --> 01:00:43,400
So that's the microbes that live in the squid actually live in some fish as well, and that makes them glow.

600
01:00:44,060 --> 01:00:51,060
And that's the bacteria sensing each other. And they tell each other to gather once in a critical concentration.

601
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:56,160
Okay. It turns out that same process, for example, is happening in all your mouth right now.

602
01:00:56,220 --> 01:00:57,720
No, your powers are not glowing.

603
01:00:58,020 --> 01:01:07,290
But when the bacteria reach a certain level, they start producing toxins and proteases can break down your guns or cause damage to your teeth.

604
01:01:08,370 --> 01:01:17,430
So it's a bit like the bill is exactly gone back to communicating with each other to coordinate their behavior.

605
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:21,000
And many diseases are a consequence of that.

606
01:01:21,670 --> 01:01:30,240
You only realize this in the last two decades, really. We knew about it back in 1968, but it was like this fundamental papers on.

607
01:01:30,250 --> 01:01:33,719
Why is that squid blowing? Oh, it's the bacteria regrew them in a flash.

608
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:42,930
They glow. But we didn't really mean that to fund that that that's a fundamental discovery lead to is applied concepts.

609
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:48,389
Okay that happened really in the last decade, a half to two decades.

610
01:01:48,390 --> 01:01:51,690
We started going in the last five years really gaining traction.

611
01:01:52,260 --> 01:02:03,450
Okay. So we can use quantum sensing modifiers to or analogs that look like warm sentiment activities early on to kill them,

612
01:02:03,660 --> 01:02:11,820
to prevent them from talking, to do all sorts of things and break things down that people didn't realize before.

613
01:02:12,830 --> 01:02:17,380
So the best way I can put this is I love this whole topic area here.

614
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:22,990
We can be the judge of the upcoming lectures by warmongers.

615
01:02:23,890 --> 01:02:30,160
Yeah, and here's a politicians one. Uh, so basically, I mean, I'm here to turn you in.

616
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:33,729
If you weren't here serving warmongers and using anti-politics would be bad.

617
01:02:33,730 --> 01:02:37,540
Politicians were lies at Michael's and it tells you one thing when they should be doing another.

618
01:02:37,870 --> 01:02:39,990
I'm a single politicians lib. I'm a musician.

619
01:02:40,330 --> 01:02:49,690
The point is, though we speak in the feed and miscommunication may be feelings of like new information that changes how the Michael is behave.

620
01:02:49,690 --> 01:02:55,540
We we we changed how they do things that can be a good thing or a bad thing.

621
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:56,470
Okay.

622
01:02:56,800 --> 01:03:06,460
We may modify the behavior to enhance protection, or you might modify their behavior through that communication to prevent them from causing disease.

623
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:12,090
Okay. Okay.

624
01:03:12,150 --> 01:03:18,570
Um, I mentioned a second ago be prebiotics, but I would like to touch on probiotics that the move design piece.

625
01:03:18,780 --> 01:03:22,560
So that's another big thing that I think we should talk about.

626
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:28,380
And microbial predators. So the idea of using things that go after pathogens.

627
01:03:30,150 --> 01:03:33,990
Okay. Um, I like this one.

628
01:03:34,140 --> 01:03:39,000
It's a bit of a spare expense, but I have in mind persistence eyes.

629
01:03:39,570 --> 01:03:44,670
The idea that I mentioned this last time someone goes is in a coma.

630
01:03:45,700 --> 01:03:51,640
And you can throw any amount of antibiotics out of them and they just won't catch and they'll wake up later and cause disease all over again.

631
01:03:51,940 --> 01:03:56,950
Right. So there's ways to potentially wake up microorganisms.

632
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:06,590
Wake up. It's time to die, isn't it macabre? They go also to try and poisonous, and they do it automatically that poison when they die as well.

633
01:04:06,890 --> 01:04:10,940
Okay. There's also a emergence of invasive polymer technologies.

634
01:04:11,990 --> 01:04:22,549
Um, so these are like things which actually can scrape things off bottoms off, effectively surfaces, surface, cashless hygiene strategy.

635
01:04:22,550 --> 01:04:25,930
This is a cool one for the sturgeon mild case.

636
01:04:26,060 --> 01:04:39,590
Now you'll see the webcam was on my old boss in Manchester. He developed a technology which has enzymes on hand at all compounds attached to surfaces.

637
01:04:40,670 --> 01:04:45,200
And when he took that first, so you have compounds attached to surface.

638
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:54,620
When bacteria land onto the surface, they produce enzymes that break down those compounds and the products, those compounds are anti-microbial.

639
01:04:55,190 --> 01:05:06,110
So essentially you have you have microorganisms dying by the act of attacking to a surface and trying to multiply over.

640
01:05:06,890 --> 01:05:14,600
So that's another one. And then ablation technology similar to paints the idea that material leaches

641
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:18,740
off over time but takes the material with it so nothing can really attach.

642
01:05:19,340 --> 01:05:28,400
Okay. So for example, on the houses ships, they're looking at putting particular paints down, but this is a huge issue right now.

643
01:05:29,030 --> 01:05:35,269
And eventually, can you see some falling hold of ships going back about 30 years ago?

644
01:05:35,270 --> 01:05:44,850
We're using single tributo to. Travel Retail ten did a good job at preventing bacteria forming biofilms are ships and the Navy loved it.

645
01:05:44,890 --> 01:05:50,480
Their ships been really, really ridiculously fast. Downside was all the marine life died.

646
01:05:51,740 --> 01:05:58,070
It actually wiped out large populations of cockles and whelks and shrimps and so forth.

647
01:05:58,100 --> 01:06:01,490
Shrimps, shrimp, even in the harvest.

648
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:07,910
So we actually had to get rid of that kind of new technology, which we technology is stuff that actually comes off over time.

649
01:06:08,150 --> 01:06:17,780
So it's like self-cleaning. Okay. Based on all discussions and analysis.

650
01:06:17,820 --> 01:06:23,070
Well, this is why I'm also posing that we're gonna be covering now with this whole this coming together.

651
01:06:23,430 --> 01:06:28,050
I definitely will talk about Trip as I'm with you all. I mentioned it last time and I'm like, we want to talk about that.

652
01:06:28,230 --> 01:06:35,700
It's use in cosmetic and health care. I will be surprised if any of you have or discover Trump is on anything you find in your house.

653
01:06:36,450 --> 01:06:40,590
I guess we working at the weekend or next week, but if you do still act.

654
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:47,040
But it's been it's been toned down as this news is being removed when a lot of products worldwide.

655
01:06:47,410 --> 01:06:58,410
Okay. It is a it is a big huge moment for a lot of companies and apologize and to turn it off.

656
01:07:02,860 --> 01:07:08,920
Okay. Um. So, uh, so yeah.

657
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:14,080
Basically, I'm thinking that I like to cover the tracks on pace.

658
01:07:14,410 --> 01:07:17,650
Does that sound good then? Nitrates.

659
01:07:19,180 --> 01:07:23,709
What do you think of bacon on the screen? And even heard about the nitrates.

660
01:07:23,710 --> 01:07:32,920
Nitrates should be nitrates there as well, actually. Nitrates, nitrates doing nitrates, nitrates doing the type of in nitrates.

661
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:38,800
Nitrates together should be listed. There's all sorts of concerning additives to foods.

662
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:45,010
Nitrates in particular are used for as a food preservative.

663
01:07:46,110 --> 01:07:51,600
Actually, it's the way my father controls way. The sterilization process prevents food spoilage.

664
01:07:51,750 --> 01:07:56,010
It also has a nice additive set to making meat your bread. That's what the bacon express.

665
01:07:56,580 --> 01:08:02,639
So the big concern right now over its use in bacon and foods like sausages is preservatives.

666
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:07,000
It never had its. Two celery salt.

667
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:09,630
You know, that's why a lot of companies that smoke,

668
01:08:10,010 --> 01:08:18,049
they don't put like I wouldn't say synthetic but they it was celery salt and said, you know, they say it's nitrate free.

669
01:08:18,050 --> 01:08:24,260
And then they claim Ashton was like, oh, we use celery. So that's nitrates because it's kind of the same thing.

670
01:08:24,590 --> 01:08:32,150
Yeah, this is a national total kind of thing. It's not quite as bad as actually going to cover smoking as well.

671
01:08:32,930 --> 01:08:36,550
The smoking of foods has got a really long history and it's making a comeback.

672
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:45,800
I mean, you just go up. Jackson was that restaurant that we spent food, Zingerman's segments.

673
01:08:47,270 --> 01:08:53,540
It's good. It's good. But traditionally, smoking was not so much for the taste is about preserving foods.

674
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:57,800
So we all agree on that. But there are issues, health issues of affecting that every day.

675
01:08:58,380 --> 01:09:07,340
Okay. Also want to touch upon certain growth. Promoters are blow your minds with about how much of the world's meat actually has

676
01:09:07,340 --> 01:09:13,590
been enhanced using compounds that are involved in microbial control movement.

677
01:09:14,630 --> 01:09:17,810
So we might have heard about this. Anyone at the institute.

678
01:09:17,900 --> 01:09:24,830
It doesn't really doesn't matter what it does make the meat bigger.

679
01:09:24,890 --> 01:09:28,970
Yes. That's part of what the argument is and the concern at the same time.

680
01:09:29,510 --> 01:09:33,950
So, yes, it's not on use of antibiotics as good promoters as well as other things.

681
01:09:34,690 --> 01:09:40,190
You guys are aware of this. I guess we all, some of you notice are not.

682
01:09:40,190 --> 01:09:45,470
So it's great. There's actually new fantastic question. And then the final thing is alcohol and mouthwashes.

683
01:09:46,190 --> 01:09:51,080
So I think one of the quizzes we're going to do and she's going be on alcohol and mouthwashes and alternatives as well,

684
01:09:51,410 --> 01:09:55,730
I think that'll be a lot of fun to do. And I should make you the mouthwash in a different way.

685
01:09:56,210 --> 01:09:59,980
Okay. Um. That's it.

686
01:10:01,250 --> 01:10:04,660
You actually finished 5 minutes early for that. Any questions?

687
01:10:08,710 --> 01:10:12,460
That is fantastic. Again, this isn't now the large.

688
01:10:12,460 --> 01:10:14,230
This is the bell was about to go.

689
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:20,710
So if there's any other things that you can think of that you haven't heard in here that you would like to hear about.

690
01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:26,500
Email me. Okay. Because I can easily set things in,

691
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:35,980
modify events in several types of events to cater to things that you might be interested in or heard on the question of What's all this about?

692
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:41,780
Okay. Well, um, speed wise was, I don't know.

693
01:10:41,780 --> 01:10:45,970
Okay. Is, I don't know. Words that I know I'm bullish and talk fast.

694
01:10:47,790 --> 01:10:55,209
But again, I won't be offended if I start going too fast. I know I get excited about some of these things and I start talking fast.

695
01:10:55,210 --> 01:11:00,300
Feel free to just behind me say, Hey, it's going to be back and I'll be okay.

696
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:10,240
Okay, wonderful. Well, have a good rest of the day. Um, and, uh, I'm grateful that should was done.
