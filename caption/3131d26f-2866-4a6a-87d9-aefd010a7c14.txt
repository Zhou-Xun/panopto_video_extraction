1
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:05,430
I feel like. Yeah, it's nice.

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:24,720
See? So, like, I'd like to thank you guys like you have got it where I feel like I know he works.

3
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:32,110
Like I would have my hands on leave to try to fix something.

4
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:55,950
I got I was like moving things like, oh, you know, I it's like my feelings, but, you know,

5
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:15,620
and I was doing like a little market and they had like those kids where I was 11 making them so much and they were really good.

6
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:31,630
It was something that was just going to stop, just like, Yeah, yeah, here.

7
00:01:33,060 --> 00:02:13,200
So. And I was just like, you know, like, because it was like I was also very that there's not enough blankets and I'm like near like,

8
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:23,440
yeah, actually that's in there before you go in there.

9
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:28,300
That was really nice trading drinks for you.

10
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:33,810
I, I was like, I can see why.

11
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:50,370
You know, there's more like there's not a chance that Marjorie passed out.

12
00:02:55,030 --> 00:03:10,469
And I'm already, like, walking in this hallway, and I could hear people talking to each other like it was felt like the guys,

13
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:27,280
like I heard it was about $20 and everyone was, like, starving again.

14
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:35,940
I wanted to just reiterate that I was so I wasn't raised by the presentation this last week and all that.

15
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:40,709
I didn't it was it was just so amazing to see it.

16
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:48,330
I'm like something even more forward to today. It was also for those of you who present in BuzzFeed's excellent work.

17
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:52,110
And so we have another set of presentations today,

18
00:03:52,620 --> 00:04:04,409
and Dominique is going to send out that we talked about last week just through canvas like we did last week, and we added some perks to it.

19
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:13,170
So if you want to do, I can point to many of you donated, you've been doing so well, but if you choose to utilize them, you can.

20
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:23,130
Each group has about 15 minutes and I apologize to the groups last week that I wasn't quite clear about.

21
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,680
This was quite sad. Little plan.

22
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:33,270
Clearly you can't see from back there. But I'm going to put out two sides for keeping track.

23
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:38,150
So 2 minutes and then time's up and you can sort of keep track of this.

24
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:42,719
Okay. So let's get started with our five groups.

25
00:04:42,720 --> 00:05:26,840
So we have chronic diseases management. But do you recognize anything else that you've got to do?

26
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,120
I don't think I have. Oh, your parents.

27
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:41,150
Do you have somewhere we could put the other thing we can use?

28
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:50,750
We can just play one Google drive. Yeah. Yeah. So users, the doctors and all that.

29
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:18,690
James. Know.

30
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:49,310
Thank you so much. I was like.

31
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:22,540
Yes. How?

32
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:56,310
Like plates. You know, what would you do if you could do all of those things?

33
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:20,950
Tonight, looking into these six people out of their homes, I do not expect to be able to about this.

34
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:28,600
I think that someone is going to be okay.

35
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:32,350
Hi, everyone. My name is Mary. This is my son, Abby. So I'm Elizabeth.

36
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:38,950
And our conceptual motto is focused on rheumatoid arthritis detection and index smokers.

37
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:45,580
So I'll give you some background on rheumatoid arthritis if you're not as familiar as we are at this point.

38
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:54,549
It's a chronic disease that essentially attacks the lining in your joints if you have it, and causes a lot of swelling and inflammation.

39
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:58,570
And from this like pain and it's progressive.

40
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:03,400
So it gets worse over time and really limits people's ability to physically function.

41
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:08,739
At this point, the biological cause is unknown, so it's really hard to diagnose and treat.

42
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:20,250
It takes a lot of like blood tests and stuff to figure out. So at this point in time, about 1.3 million adults in the US have rheumatoid arthritis.

43
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:25,620
70% of those are women. So it's really disproportionately high in women.

44
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:34,740
And typically the average age of onset is between 40 and 60, but it's generally detected more in your sixties.

45
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:41,310
And so we really wanted to look at some early detection and you can see some like effects of it there.

46
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:45,510
People with aura have higher risk of heart disease and stuff like that too.

47
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:56,180
And then we looked into what the estimated kind of societal cost of our rate is, and it's about $39 billion annually.

48
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:02,900
And that comes from various things like direct medical costs, you think hospitalizations, screening, stuff like that.

49
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:07,240
Pharmacological costs are like the medication required to treat it.

50
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:13,249
That's really expensive. And then the big one that we honed in on was this like on or underemployment,

51
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:20,209
which means that there's a lot of people who aren't able to continue to work full time or at all as this disease progresses,

52
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:23,210
because it takes such a physical toll on their body.

53
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:29,750
And that kind of loss of wages and loss of productivity is a huge hit to our society.

54
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:35,170
Okay. So so that kind of mentioned don't go into this a little bit.

55
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:38,300
So who's more at risk for developing Aria than others?

56
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:46,850
So as we know, women are especially individuals of Hispanic or black ethnicities, smokers and those who suffer from obesity.

57
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:49,339
Because of this,

58
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:59,000
we decided to hone in our target population to Hispanic women under the age of 60 who are currently smoking or have a history of smoking.

59
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:08,190
So research shows that our target population has a difficulty accessing our education.

60
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:15,690
So are proximal outcomes for our conceptual model was to increase early detection and early access of our treatment,

61
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:22,650
and we assumed that by reaching these proximal outcomes that we would be able to reach our distal outcomes,

62
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:32,250
which is a decreased cost of care for our treatment and decreased amount of women having to leave the workforce due to having.

63
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:41,860
You know, our model, our main goal was to get this group of people who are oftentimes higher at risk but don't know it,

64
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:49,030
to recognize their risk and recognize the threat that IRA poses to them, but also to know the benefits of early detection.

65
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:52,389
Maybe you'll go with the details of the series after this.

66
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:59,740
But basically, we want them to, first of all, know things like insurance and what options for testing exist, how to access them.

67
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:06,040
A big motivation. So we want them to know to be motivated to go get this.

68
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:09,970
That's because they'll know how it helps them, you know, feel better.

69
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,060
Oftentimes we know that with them earlier, that leads to better outcomes and lower cost of care in the long run.

70
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:21,760
Right. And so what they know of that and they are seeking out their annual blood test.

71
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:27,760
And it wasn't really anything, not just for a blood test, because oftentimes people don't know to ask for that when they go to the primary care.

72
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:33,730
So short term, we expect that this disease will be detected earlier in the population,

73
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:40,810
but also long term that it'll help them to treat it and then give people looked at the workforce and contribute to the economy longer as well.

74
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:48,790
Yeah. So like I mentioned, our conceptual model was informed by social cognitive theory.

75
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:58,720
So this helped us understand both the individual and structural barriers that contribute to and the under diagnosis and under treatment.

76
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:04,809
So the integrated behavior includes things like the knowledge of our risk factors,

77
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:10,460
for example, smoking woman and the effects and the treatment options.

78
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,629
So yeah, just understanding that.

79
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:19,800
And then the antecedents include the factors that make people more or less likely to pursue treatment.

80
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:22,210
So we'll see. In the intervention that we designed,

81
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:31,450
we really wanted to meet people where they were and understand if they had access to primary care and like where they were getting access.

82
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:34,810
So that was really important to designing an effective strategy.

83
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:41,350
And then individual barriers include things like the inability to quit smoking and how to cope with the disease.

84
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:53,280
As we mentioned, it's very progressive, so people may not see the need to address their are until it progresses too far and makes it harder to treat.

85
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:58,749
So kind of understanding earlier on how to treat that and then structural barriers

86
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:02,920
include things like language barriers at their provider only speaks English,

87
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:08,290
but that's not their first language and they're not comfortable with that lack of primary care access.

88
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:17,350
Obviously people in the US do not all have access to primary care and many people don't and lack of education surrounding our age.

89
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:27,129
And then the outcomes, like Mary mentioned, early detection of early access to treatment and then the longer term outcomes of women

90
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:33,880
leaving the workforce and the overall costs of care that can be reduced by early diagnosis.

91
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,270
So now I was just going to talk about the intervention.

92
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:46,720
And based on our conceptual model, we decided to go for a intervention that was a combined educational and support program.

93
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:55,150
And this was this was to increase the awareness of our right and the motivation to seek screening and treatment services,

94
00:14:55,180 --> 00:15:03,100
specifically early on when it can be detected. And since a partnership with federally qualified health centers, because, as was just mentioned,

95
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:09,040
a lot of the individuals in our population do not have access to health care in a traditional primary care setting.

96
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:16,680
So this is going to be targeting self-efficacy, barriers, knowledge and motivation related to writing.

97
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:24,490
And the first part of this is a screening for people with risk factors for me at these federally qualified health centers.

98
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:31,930
And then for individuals that we find to be at high risk, we'll start out by providing them educational materials right on site.

99
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:37,090
This will be physical materials such as brochures and also prerecorded videos.

100
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:44,410
They will contain information on the risks and benefits of early diagnosis of our ED and

101
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:52,300
emphasize the increased risk and hence increased benefits that are possible for this population.

102
00:15:52,840 --> 00:16:01,270
And overall, the aim will be to reinforce the perceived benefits of detection of risk and increase the self-efficacy,

103
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:07,600
which will encourage the belief that the long term outcomes of the behavior related to this will benefit.

104
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:15,610
And the second component is a referral to an RJ preventative care support group.

105
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:20,560
And this specifically will be facilitated virtually by a member of the population

106
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:25,000
who has experienced themselves with living with it and working to manage it.

107
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:33,540
And we are going to be working with the health centers to provide both the location and the technology that is necessary for accessing this,

108
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:38,129
since it's very possible that many of the people in this group in our population

109
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:43,230
will not be able to access it themselves at home due to a variety of challenges.

110
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,890
We will focus on discussions of self-management, financial resources and communities,

111
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:54,090
since we think that these in particular would be helpful to facilitate our goals.

112
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:58,870
But whatever would be helpful for these populations to discuss is completely open.

113
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:03,059
We want them to focus on whatever they need. And once again,

114
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:07,500
this will aim to improve self efficacy and also to decrease the perceived barriers

115
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:13,170
related to screening treatment for and knowledge of the disease management.

116
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:21,750
Okay. So some reflections from this journey and make making our conceptual model.

117
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:25,440
We recognize that trial and error is progress.

118
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:32,610
We went through a lot of trial and error, specifically in our research and creating the diagram of the conceptual model itself.

119
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,750
So with all that trial and error, we wouldn't have gone where we are now.

120
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:40,770
Time time management is very crucial for success.

121
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:42,389
We found that in a group of five.

122
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:48,629
It is pretty difficult finding a time that worked for everybody with everyone's busy schedules and things that pop up.

123
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:53,870
So that was especially important throughout this.

124
00:17:53,880 --> 00:18:03,180
And then also a piece of advice going forward would be to get feedback early on or on the research part on all of it.

125
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:07,290
So thanks to Dominique on that one. Yeah.

126
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:19,160
This sexual health, infectious disease.

127
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:42,580
Just like. Was.

128
00:18:52,620 --> 00:19:03,650
Okay, everyone, we are the SETI Prevention Group, and our project focuses on homeless woman who are living in Detroit, Michigan.

129
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:13,400
My name is Emma. Sarah Charania TV So jumping into the background of a.

130
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:27,700
She doesn't like that. Oh, it's back again.

131
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:33,170
Do we trust you? Okay.

132
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:38,750
So our project centers the increasingly important topic of STI prevention.

133
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:47,540
In 2018, the estimated SETI prevalence and incidence in the US was approximately 68,000,026 million respectively.

134
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:53,750
Preliminary data for 2021 surveillance also suggests rising rates of cities across the country.

135
00:19:54,740 --> 00:20:02,060
It's important to note here that STIs are pretty often asymptomatic and therefore can go undetected and also unreported.

136
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,110
And because these surveillance data are based on reported diagnoses,

137
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:12,410
it's likely that these estimates are actually underrepresentation of the true high rate in the country.

138
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:19,230
And because ashes are transmitted at a variety of ways, they truly can affect anyone.

139
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:23,520
However, there are some key groups who are disproportionately affected.

140
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,319
These groups include racial and ethnic minorities, women, infants,

141
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:33,330
adolescents and young adults and people who face housing instability and homelessness.

142
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:42,570
Research suggests that the more days that someone spends homeless, the more likely that person is to engage in high risk sexual practices over time.

143
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:49,770
Specifically homeless young adult women in the US have a higher reported prevalence of chlamydia and gonorrhea.

144
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:56,220
And within Michigan, the city of Detroit has the highest rates of gonorrhea, chlamydia and syphilis in the state.

145
00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:03,270
And as of 2021, the rate of gonorrhea in Detroit has increased by 75% since 2010.

146
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:11,820
So given the disparate rates of STIs among young women who are also facing housing instability,

147
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:21,000
we decided to target our project around women who are aged 18 to 30 and are facing housing instability while living in Detroit, Michigan.

148
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:26,579
So for a little more information on our target population today,

149
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:32,670
homeless women and their families comprise the fastest growing subpopulation of homeless people in the US,

150
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:36,990
and an estimated 39% of people facing homelessness are women.

151
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:46,740
This subpopulation is also primarily made up of young, single women between the ages of 18 to 30 who belong to a minority racial status.

152
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:55,160
Previous research demonstrates that childhood abuse, substance use disorders and mental health concerns are some of the primary factors

153
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:59,930
that put homeless women at greater risk for STI infection than the House population.

154
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:05,180
A qualitative study of homeless mothers living in Detroit echoed these themes.

155
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,420
Many women shared stories of experiencing violence,

156
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:14,120
substance use disorders and intergenerational poverty in addition to challenges managing mental health concerns.

157
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:20,060
So given the heightened risk of infection among this group that is growing in size.

158
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:27,410
Interventions that address the root causes of STI infection and also meet the needs of women experiencing homelessness are really crucial.

159
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:36,220
So just to kind of go into the outcomes that affect our target population and that my.

160
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:41,710
Our first outcome is going to be the proximal outcome of just the contraction of stages.

161
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:46,150
But then our first distal outcome is pelvic inflammatory disease.

162
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:51,819
So PID can develop between one and 12 months after someone's initial STI infection.

163
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:58,600
So it's especially crucial, especially when guys are left untreated, that we combat the rising rates in PID.

164
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:06,460
And then our second distal outcome of interest is chronic pelvic pain, which I'll go into a little bit more into a couple of slides.

165
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:16,030
So with regard to the specific STIs that we kind of that our literature kind of suggested our target population are predominantly impacted by,

166
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:19,570
these we found were syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.

167
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:24,700
And to kind of go a little bit more into our first distal outcome and just to kind of

168
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:29,440
give everybody some important stats as to how prevalent and important this issue is.

169
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:36,190
About 2.5 million women between the ages of 18 and 44 were unfortunately impacted by PID,

170
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:41,920
according to the 2013 2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.

171
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:47,860
And as I said earlier, if ACS are left untreated, they can lead to PID.

172
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:55,450
So just as a reminder this there be an increased prevalence in individuals who have had a prior contraction of an STI.

173
00:23:56,860 --> 00:24:01,000
And then with regards to our second distal outcome, which was chronic pelvic pain,

174
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:08,170
this is defined as pain symptoms perceived to originate from pelvic organs and structures, and this typically lasts longer than six months.

175
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:16,300
And just to kind of give everyone a sense of how how much how many people are impacted by chronic pelvic pain.

176
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,630
This is about one in seven women in the U.S. per year.

177
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,080
So it's a pretty, you know, predominant issue that people face.

178
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:30,790
And then lastly, just to kind of give everyone a more individualized impact as to what this looks like on a monetary scale.

179
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:41,530
Women each women per year is expected to spend about between 1.8 K and 20.9 K on health care costs related to chronic pelvic pain.

180
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:47,980
So clearly, this is obviously very important financially, very important physically, health wise, very important.

181
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:56,229
So the prevention and early diagnosis and treatment of STIs is really, really crucial, especially in our vulnerable population.

182
00:24:56,230 --> 00:25:00,730
That AMA highlighted where the rates as guys have been rising and this ultimately I

183
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:05,110
would hope we would hope would be to decrease for proximal and to sort outcomes.

184
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:09,310
So now I'm going to hand it off to Katie to talk about our conceptual model.

185
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:14,930
Thank you. Awesome. So I'll be talking about our conceptual model.

186
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:22,180
So this is kind of our final project of our model of looking at the predictor of exchange homelessness

187
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:27,880
in our proximal and distant outcomes of contraction of eyes in PID and chronic pelvic pain.

188
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:33,520
And as a few groups noted last week, this took many, many iterations to get to this point,

189
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:37,930
and it was a big struggle getting from our initial product to here.

190
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:42,550
So again, thanks to Dominique and Dr. Patel for your support in this difficult process.

191
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:50,860
But we came up with one key mediator, which was sex practices, especially risky sex practices,

192
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:57,010
as mediating the relationship between experiencing homelessness and contraction of ties.

193
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:01,570
And then we came up with a couple of moderators who supported by the literature.

194
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:09,130
So our model focused had a few different theories that supported our findings.

195
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:12,310
The first one I'm going to talk about is social cognitive theory.

196
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:24,640
So examining our mediator, especially the concept of self efficacy, came up a lot, which is one of the key concepts in social cognitive theory.

197
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:33,670
So just to review, the concept of self-efficacy refers to the level of a person's confidence in their ability to successfully perform a behavior.

198
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:41,770
So self-efficacy has been shown to be an important predictor of condom use, as well as the ability to consent or not consent to sex.

199
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:47,230
And then another key from social cognitive theory was outcome expectations.

200
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:54,190
So the anticipated consequence of a person's behavior, which also has been shown to inform whether people use condoms or not.

201
00:26:56,070 --> 00:27:00,900
Another theory that informed our model was the transactional model of stress and coping.

202
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:04,950
So specifically in our moderators substance use,

203
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:12,320
we found in the literature that substance use strength increases in between risky sexual practices and STI contraction.

204
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:15,790
So using that transactional model of stress, opening,

205
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:23,520
coping to look at that substance use like alcohol consumption for example, allows for temporary relief from daily stressors,

206
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:34,200
which reinforces coping mechanisms like alcohol use or any substance use in attempt to regulate a negative effect like housing insecurity especially.

207
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:37,410
So we found that to be one of the moderators of this association.

208
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:47,130
And then lastly, we'll talk about the social ecological model, particularly for this part of our conceptual model.

209
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:57,350
So the social ecological model considers the interplay between different levels, including individual, interpersonal, community and societal factors.

210
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:04,980
So we use this theory to consider the demographic factors in access to care, in the impact between these relationships.

211
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:10,620
So people experiencing homelessness have been shown to have worse access to health care,

212
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:18,030
which leads to barriers to STI screening and safer sex products, which can lead to increased likelihood of contraction of STI.

213
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:22,110
And then individual demographic factors also impact access to care.

214
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:31,249
Now we'll talk about our intervention. So we looked at how to do this.

215
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:38,989
We obviously measure theory, but we also looked at the theory of action in our entire organization, inflation theory.

216
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:46,850
So we talked a lot about the theory that is the increase of democracy causing for sex and harm reduction through abuse and action.

217
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:53,070
It addresses volitional motivation control in practicing these next halving,

218
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:59,180
practicing and the international relations theory talks about community and community organization.

219
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:05,750
And so what we'll be doing is in collaboration with alternatives for Girls Attorneys for Girls,

220
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:11,780
a Detroit based nonprofit that works with women and girls.

221
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:17,750
And so they create housing stability for them. So we'll collaborate with them to create an accessible community clinic.

222
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:24,019
And then I'll be guiding this collaboration because that so we hope that

223
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:30,020
attorneys for Girls will train formerly homeless females to deliver educational

224
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:39,440
workshops and to provide information about this community clinic so that they are forming about these workshops that will have about consent,

225
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:42,590
what a condom is, how to use a condom.

226
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:51,950
And they will also have the clinic will also provide screening safer sex supplies, such as condoms, male and female condoms.

227
00:29:52,340 --> 00:30:00,530
And then we'll also provide a syringe services program where it will be access to and have a safe, dismal title for needles and syringe.

228
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:07,100
So we're hoping that these workshops and the community clinic, if it is successful here in Detroit,

229
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:11,650
the hope is to be able to apply this intervention in other areas of homelessness.

230
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:26,400
Awesome. Yeah. So as many people have echoed throughout these presentations, we found the same thing that building conceptual models is not easy.

231
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:36,220
It requires a lot of iterations and thinking deeply about what evidence to back the arrows that you draw between box to box.

232
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:47,389
And then being able to delve really deep into a really broad and important topic such as SETI prevention was really eye opening for all of us,

233
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:53,900
and especially getting to kind of cater that to a target population that was specifically within Southeast Michigan was really unique to us.

234
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:58,520
And I think we all learned a lot, especially those of us that haven't had much exposure to this topic.

235
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:03,470
And we just kind of learned that there is a lot of room for improvement and a lot of work to be done within the field.

236
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:13,639
And then we were lucky to have a really supportive team and we were in communication with the whole process through the

237
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:20,690
semester so much easier and learn that like setting up dates beforehand to meet was super helpful for the whole process.

238
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:24,620
But yeah, having a supportive team make the whole project experience really great.

239
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:32,030
And lastly, Tom, in Health Sciences, libraries are political space to use education as has access after hours.

240
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:36,500
So go ahead and use them. Thank you all.

241
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:50,660
Thank you. The actual convention can be in the building.

242
00:31:50,980 --> 00:32:02,350
Of course, at some point we're going to see physical work.

243
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:14,120
At that point, if you go somewhere else, like I'll be different next, it's like I'm like this.

244
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:22,710
Like someone.

245
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,060
I'll take it one last night.

246
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:34,190
Oh, yeah.

247
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:40,210
Try to put that together. It's really good. It's a transition.

248
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:46,720
I'm going to go choosing the same consulting club as true an undergrad.

249
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:51,370
So, like, she wants to bring in another.

250
00:32:55,490 --> 00:33:06,250
At least 30 M.D.

251
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:43,650
See every single person and every account which you can see, okay, allow everyone.

252
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:46,889
We are the cancer prevention and management group in order to be talking about

253
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:51,150
prostate cancer screening for transgender and gender diverse individuals of prostate.

254
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:55,980
And just for reference, we will be using that acronym throughout the presentation.

255
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:03,240
So we know that prostate cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in the United States after breast cancer.

256
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:10,800
It's expected that there's around 268,000 new cases of prostate cancer that will be diagnosed in the United States in 2022.

257
00:34:12,390 --> 00:34:19,080
With that. We also know that about one in eight individuals are assigned to male at birth, will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in their lifetime.

258
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:26,969
And there's also additional statistics out there that really emphasize the importance of detecting prostate cancer early.

259
00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:32,520
So if it's found early on, nearly 100% of individuals will live five years or longer.

260
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:40,920
But if it's caught a bit later, after the cancer has metastasized beyond the prostate, the five year survival rate drops to about 31%.

261
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:50,249
We also know that aside from sex assigned at birth, that there are additional factors that contribute to the risk of prostate cancer,

262
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:53,700
which includes age, race and genetics or family history.

263
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:58,770
So we also see like these examples here that six out of ten cases develop and individuals,

264
00:34:58,770 --> 00:35:05,130
65 and older, higher rates of non-Hispanic black men and that family history is also a contributor.

265
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:11,540
So our target population is the target population.

266
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:16,040
So there is about 1.3 million adults in the United States that identify as transgender.

267
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:22,520
It's about 38% of those being transgender women and around 25% being gender non-conforming.

268
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:30,830
An important note about that is the statistic doesn't tell us which of those in gender non-conforming were assigned to male at birth,

269
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:38,660
but still does tell us that there is a large population of individuals that are transgender in the United States.

270
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:46,190
This image on the right also talks a little bit about what gender affirming care looks like.

271
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:52,010
So often when individuals seek gender affirming care, surgical intervention does not remove the prostate.

272
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:56,000
So the prostate still is often in these individuals bodies.

273
00:35:56,330 --> 00:35:59,990
And then this these arrows, they don't expect you to be able to follow them.

274
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:08,389
But it's just talking about how gender or gender affirming hormone therapy and how that impacts the hormones throughout the body,

275
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:17,840
including in the prostate. So this also tells us that prostate cancer is technically at a decreased risk in individuals of the target population.

276
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:23,240
But it also emphasizes to us that prostate cancer is not nonexistent in this population.

277
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:28,540
So when we think about prostate cancer screening,

278
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:35,630
you're probably very familiar with lots of different bodies and organizations that have these screening guidelines.

279
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:43,299
So American Cancer Society USPSTF of a lot of this is based in extensive research

280
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:49,300
that's been analyzed and reviewed like this recommendation is from 2020.

281
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:52,270
I can tell you that these don't even look the same now in 2022.

282
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:59,140
So we do have a lot of information around prostate cancer screening, but that is for cisgender men.

283
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:03,910
So our question was really, what is the slope like for the TDD population?

284
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:05,850
And it honestly is a big question mark.

285
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:13,450
There aren't any set guidelines currently because we don't have the research behind it to back what those would possibly look like.

286
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:23,200
So these articles do show us that this is becoming a more prevalent conversation.

287
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:28,870
So a lot of these are from 2022. So it is becoming a question of what should we be doing?

288
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:32,380
What should screening look like for transgender women in terms of prostate cancer?

289
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:40,510
A lot of these are fantastic, too, that we're starting this conversation, but often in these articles appear to look at that and they say,

290
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:48,370
Well, we don't have enough information, so let's just have them follow the cisgender social gender male guidelines, which isn't relevant.

291
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,980
You're tailoring their screening for them.

292
00:37:52,780 --> 00:38:00,520
So all of those statistics are to say that we didn't even touch on the negative experiences that the TGT population has with the health care system.

293
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:08,320
So often they face a lot of discrimination. They have a lot of fear in interacting with their health care providers because they've been mistreated.

294
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,499
And the third one really talks about education.

295
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:17,410
A lot of health care providers aren't appropriately trained in providing gender affirming, inclusive care.

296
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:22,780
So that puts the burden back on individuals to be training their own health care providers on how to do this.

297
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:32,270
So. So based off of all of our background information that we gathered, this is the conceptual method we came up with.

298
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:38,529
I want to start off with the outcomes. For our outcomes.

299
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:43,000
The ultimate goal is to reduce mortality and morbidity, and we have a few ways of giving this.

300
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:46,960
First, we propose creating a better prostate cancer screening plan.

301
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:54,010
As, as Amy mentioned, there are a lot of unknowns as to what factors are important in terms of our population.

302
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:59,230
So creating a better screening plan that is informed by research and personalized to this population is really important.

303
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:08,380
There are some questions that we still need to answer, such as like which test for prostate cancer screening might be better for this population.

304
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:15,310
One of those tests is testing PSA blood levels of what PSA levels are significant for this population because it could be different than suspend.

305
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:22,780
We also want to increase prostate cancer screenings for appropriate individuals in this population.

306
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:29,379
And so some of our distal outcomes were to train health care providers in gender inclusive

307
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:34,450
care because many health care providers admit they were never trained on treating on.

308
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:42,670
They were never trained in gender inclusive care. So creating a training program will will help them provide better care to this population.

309
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:49,810
We also want to create evidence based clinical guidelines that promote earlier detection rates and directly impact patient care.

310
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:55,080
Now, Nicole, walk us through the rest of the conceptual maps. Thanks to you.

311
00:39:55,190 --> 00:40:00,429
So actually, I'm just going to walk us through the different variables that are leading to our outcomes.

312
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:03,220
So I first want to start with our antecedents.

313
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:08,500
So as we know, antecedents are just the background conditions that directly impact our outcome of interest.

314
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:15,940
And so for our conceptual model, and these include policy factors that will help lead to the training of health care providers,

315
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:24,969
of evidence based clinical guideline formation. And so was these policy factors there very much at a foundational level of intentional curriculum

316
00:40:24,970 --> 00:40:31,270
development and research funding that promotes inclusive training and tailored evidence based guidelines.

317
00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:37,960
Kind of like what Amy had mentioned, there's really insufficient literature currently to inform clinical guidelines for this community,

318
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:44,260
which can obviously be addressed through increased research funding and expenditure targeted for this population,

319
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:49,390
and guidelines both inform clinical care, clinical practice and clinical training.

320
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:53,139
So with these appropriate resources,

321
00:40:53,140 --> 00:41:01,660
if providers are able to receive intentional preparation on providing inclusive care while being informed by tailored evidence based guidelines,

322
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:07,060
this will affect the provider factors that eventually lead to our outcomes that I will.

323
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:18,719
So next I'll be talking about our predictor. So as we know, these are just variables that influence our outcome of interest.

324
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:23,910
So for us, our predictors are patient factors, clinical factors and provider factors.

325
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:33,149
And so with these patient factors, differences and modifying factors like demographic information and medical history will impact an individual's

326
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:40,410
awareness and personal beliefs and following screening recommendations provider factors on the bottom.

327
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:47,940
I'm kind of like what I mentioned before an ability of a provider's competency and their knowledge in providing care

328
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:55,229
and being able to communicate with their patients in the TDD community along with what personal attitudes or biases

329
00:41:55,230 --> 00:42:01,260
that they may have against this population is going to impact how a patient interacts with the provider and ultimately

330
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:09,780
impact their attitude and knowledge towards engaging in prostate cancer screening and also clinical factors.

331
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:16,890
So kind of like what Amy mentioned before as well, they face a lot of fear and discrimination in the clinic environment.

332
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:22,500
So whether or not clinics are inclusive in their interactions with their patients in the environment,

333
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:28,139
inaccessibility to clinic access for this community will also impact their perceived

334
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:32,550
barriers and their attitudes towards engaging in prostate cancer screening.

335
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:40,120
So this kind of leads us into our last set of factors which are mediators.

336
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:48,299
And so these are factors that explain the relationship between our predictors and our outcome of interest as we know.

337
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:57,480
And so for us, these include individual patient beliefs, likelihood of behavior of engaging in prostate cancer screening and cues to action.

338
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:01,870
And so our individual beliefs include the perceived susceptibility,

339
00:43:01,890 --> 00:43:08,790
perceived benefits and perceived barriers to engaging in prostate cancer screening and developing prostate cancer itself.

340
00:43:09,210 --> 00:43:11,460
So if a patient has an individualized,

341
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:18,510
personalized understanding of their risk for prostate cancer and whether or not they have that accurate knowledge and resources to receiving

342
00:43:18,510 --> 00:43:24,900
prostate cancer screening is obviously going to increase or decrease their likelihood of engaging engaging in that healthy figure,

343
00:43:25,830 --> 00:43:27,570
as well as our cues to action.

344
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:34,230
So that's kind of cut off the arrows pointing from provider factors to cues to action and then to the likelihood of behavior.

345
00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:40,650
And so providers are adequately able to motivate patients and communicate with them and engaging in behavior that's

346
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:47,880
going to either increase or decrease our patients in their likelihood of pursuing prostate cancer screening.

347
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:59,860
Okay. So that brings us to our intervention. And we are the intervention is pretty broad, so we're just a few arms of our intervention.

348
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:04,900
The title is Tap In, which is our little creative acronym.

349
00:44:05,350 --> 00:44:10,480
So TAP stands for Talk about Prostates and then that stands for inclusively.

350
00:44:11,590 --> 00:44:16,570
So that first arm of our campaign is a social marketing campaign.

351
00:44:16,930 --> 00:44:19,149
And the branding, as you can see here,

352
00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:26,110
really counters a lot of the existing social marketing branding around prostate cancer, which is typically very masculine.

353
00:44:26,110 --> 00:44:28,720
So if you think of something like Movember, like mustaches,

354
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:34,750
suits and ties like this man is typically what you see with existing social marketing campaign.

355
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:42,190
So ours uses gender inclusive and organ specific language because we really want to emphasize that

356
00:44:42,190 --> 00:44:48,130
it's not not everyone who is a man has a prostate and not everyone with a prostate is a man.

357
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:54,670
So our materials will be both digitally distributed. So we have an example of an Instagram story right here.

358
00:44:55,720 --> 00:45:00,150
And then we would also have print materials like a brochure in the middle or posters that

359
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:04,150
would be available both in clinic settings and then also in community spaces as well.

360
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:11,650
So that's our that's the first part of our intervention. And then we also came up with a few digital tools as well.

361
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:19,480
So like we said before, there's this really unfortunate lack of provider training and how to provide gender inclusive and gender affirming care.

362
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:27,250
So on the top, you'll see an example of what could be like an on demand training for medical providers to help them

363
00:45:27,250 --> 00:45:32,200
maintain competence and learn new skills about how to provide gender inclusive and gender affirming care.

364
00:45:32,890 --> 00:45:40,390
And we could foresee expanding this out into integrating this into clinical training programs, live workshops, handbooks and things like that.

365
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:48,280
And then on the bottom is our patient decision tool or decision aid that we came up with,

366
00:45:49,030 --> 00:45:54,490
because we know that not all TGT individuals have access to providers who have received this kind of training.

367
00:45:55,030 --> 00:45:58,630
So we have this patient decision aid tool to kind of settling some of those gaps.

368
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:04,690
As we alluded to, there's a lot of complex decision making that goes into that choice, that prostate cancer screening.

369
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:08,350
Whether or not you want to do a screening when you start it, when you stop it,

370
00:46:08,350 --> 00:46:12,010
what type of screening should you have and how often you should be screening?

371
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:18,160
So we want people to be able to make to make their way through that decision making process to help people

372
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:24,340
understand what is my personal risk to develop prostate cancer and what are my options as far as screening goes?

373
00:46:26,990 --> 00:46:31,220
So our interventions are informed by the belief that all the social cognitive theory.

374
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:35,600
So for Pistorius susceptibility as well as murder beliefs,

375
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:40,580
we really want to emphasize the idea that it's not just cis men who have a risk for prostate cancer.

376
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:45,920
It's everyone who has a prostate. And our social marketing materials and our decision aids,

377
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:50,809
they both really highlight some of these individual risk factors and risk modifying factors like age,

378
00:46:50,810 --> 00:46:55,010
ancestry and family history for perceived barriers.

379
00:46:55,340 --> 00:47:01,010
Some barriers like Amy was talking about are things like fear of discrimination and bias in the health care setting,

380
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:05,300
like a provider knowledge dysphoria due to non-inclusive clinic environments.

381
00:47:05,870 --> 00:47:09,800
So even the presence of our type in material in the clinic environment,

382
00:47:10,070 --> 00:47:15,080
it's kind of a signifier that this clinic is committed to providing gender inclusive and gender affirming care.

383
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:20,130
For perceived benefits and for outcome expectations.

384
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:27,179
Our campaign really wants to highlight one of the benefits of prostate cancer screening, which would be the early detection of prostate cancer.

385
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:31,680
Because, like Amy showed you, early detection is really key to preventing mortality.

386
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:38,700
And then for self efficacy and knowledge from the provider and the patient standpoint, our trainings,

387
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:44,790
our social marketing campaign, our decision aid, all of these will come together to help health care professionals.

388
00:47:44,790 --> 00:47:49,200
They'll feel more confident and competent in providing gender inclusive and gender affirming care.

389
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:55,710
And then patients will feel empowered to have these discussions and advocate for the appropriate cancer screening for themselves.

390
00:47:57,660 --> 00:48:01,830
So some takeaways and final thoughts. We had a lot of fun working together this semester.

391
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:06,480
A couple of things that came up. Amy and I are both taking risk communication with doctors.

392
00:48:06,690 --> 00:48:14,760
Fisher And a couple of weeks ago we actually discussed how prostate cancer screening alone may not actually be as effective as people think it is.

393
00:48:15,270 --> 00:48:19,379
So we discussed as a group how that information might change our project,

394
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:26,580
but we came to the decision that our model and interventions have the potential to make a large difference for this small,

395
00:48:26,730 --> 00:48:33,120
targeted population, and that's often overlooked. The risk is nuanced and must be addressed for this population.

396
00:48:34,050 --> 00:48:41,459
And as I mentioned, there's a lot of stigmatizing marketing in regards to right now what's available, which is very masculine.

397
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:49,920
And so we wanted to do something that was more inclusive. And in general, we are a group of genetic counseling students and public health students.

398
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:58,770
And so the interprofessional collaboration was something that we kind of got the feel for, the need for how important that is in public health.

399
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:10,790
You come back. I see.

400
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:32,440
Just that you get the nice things about your spirit.

401
00:49:35,570 --> 00:49:39,580
I mean, it's like. It's like it's just.

402
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:43,330
It's not very much about how it happens.

403
00:49:47,850 --> 00:49:52,000
It's just where they're going.

404
00:49:52,040 --> 00:50:10,350
I was like, you know, so I was like, Oh, I like doing things here, and you don't have to do what you want.

405
00:50:11,710 --> 00:50:22,950
You can protect my sister.

406
00:50:22,990 --> 00:50:34,080
You'll have to go.

407
00:50:34,090 --> 00:50:37,260
Maybe because she doesn't know.

408
00:50:38,590 --> 00:51:05,330
You just mentioned earlier this year, I suppose, right next to my colleague Hyde Park signed.

409
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:15,030
I think I should have already said so. All right.

410
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:21,550
Hello, everyone. We are going to be talking about preventing intimate partner violence for inner city women of color.

411
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:24,640
My name is Mikayla. I'm the likes of.

412
00:51:27,410 --> 00:51:31,370
And this is just a brief overview of what we're talking about today.

413
00:51:33,110 --> 00:51:36,370
So to provide you some background. All right.

414
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:40,550
Now, intimate partner violence is a huge issue both around the world and in the US.

415
00:51:41,030 --> 00:51:46,220
Intimate partner violence can be defined as any type of violence against a current or former intimate partner.

416
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:51,080
Some examples of intimate partner violence can include but aren't limited to.

417
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,550
I'm sorry. Okay.

418
00:51:56,940 --> 00:52:04,050
So some examples of intimate partner violence can include physical or sexual violence, psychological abuse and or stuff.

419
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:12,719
Unfortunately intimate partner violence is a huge problem in the US is one out of three or 33% of

420
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:17,670
adults living in the US have experienced intimate partner violence at some point in their lives.

421
00:52:18,810 --> 00:52:23,460
Intimate partner violence is most prevalent amongst 18 to 24 year olds women,

422
00:52:23,670 --> 00:52:28,290
persons of color, sexual or gender, minorities, and people with disabilities.

423
00:52:28,710 --> 00:52:36,060
However, women of color are more likely to be victimized, which prevents or presents major health equity challenges for us.

424
00:52:38,910 --> 00:52:40,860
Intimate partner violence and public health.

425
00:52:41,580 --> 00:52:49,500
Intimate partner violence is a huge public health issue, as one in five female homicides are perpetrated by current or former intimate male partners.

426
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:55,230
So one in five of all female homicides are perpetrated by an intimate partner.

427
00:52:56,760 --> 00:53:01,290
So some health outcomes that come with intimate partner violence include STIs,

428
00:53:01,290 --> 00:53:08,220
unintended pregnancies, post-traumatic stress disorder, suicide, anxiety, and substance abuse.

429
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:16,610
Alongside the health care outcomes. Intimate partner violence has a huge economic consequence on the US.

430
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:20,809
It comes with increased medical care costs, social burden,

431
00:53:20,810 --> 00:53:25,940
do the loss of productivity so that going into work, not going into school, dropping out of college,

432
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:35,180
things as such, and the criminal justice system, the overall lifetime burden of intimate partner violence in the US is relatively $3.6 trillion.

433
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:48,409
And as you were saying, the target population is pertained to of color in larger inner city populations and it's part of their

434
00:53:48,410 --> 00:53:56,660
part of lower income areas where the statistical evidence and they have less education pertaining to IPV.

435
00:53:57,290 --> 00:54:05,450
If they some people don't even know that they're in there facing intimate partner violence or they don't know the signs to look for.

436
00:54:06,530 --> 00:54:12,739
And these women are often underrepresented when it comes to speaking about intimate partner violence or not.

437
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:16,729
Listen to people just for some time to get out of the relationship.

438
00:54:16,730 --> 00:54:23,990
They have other barriers that they have to worry about, whether it's children, financial burdens, and just things of that nature.

439
00:54:26,580 --> 00:54:38,730
Okay. So this is our conceptual model for addressing intimate partner violence against women of color ages 18 to 24 years living in inner cities.

440
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:45,420
So our conceptual model is based on the self-determination theory and social cognitive theory concepts.

441
00:54:45,930 --> 00:54:57,270
And we address two main categories to inform our intervention, which are person centered factors and socio environmental factors.

442
00:54:58,380 --> 00:55:06,120
So firstly, our persons and our factors are focused around personal processes such as perceived susceptibility,

443
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:10,590
perceived benefits, perceived barriers and self-efficacy.

444
00:55:11,870 --> 00:55:17,510
And then. So for social factors, we wanted to define ourselves.

445
00:55:17,870 --> 00:55:26,540
For socio environmental factors, we wanted to dig deep and social environmental factors because those play a huge role in our everyday lives.

446
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:33,620
So for social factors, we discussed social support and social attributes or attitudes and structural racism.

447
00:55:34,190 --> 00:55:42,080
In terms of environmental factors. We discussed accessibility to the neighborhood that these people grew up in, live and work in.

448
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:47,420
And poverty. And unemployment rates. We also discussed community.

449
00:55:47,870 --> 00:55:57,800
So in this community, we discussed the legal structure of the resources that are in this community and perceived perceived safety and violence rates,

450
00:55:59,390 --> 00:56:05,930
together with all these antecedents, come and really influence what we think are going to be our moderators of our outcome,

451
00:56:06,290 --> 00:56:09,710
which are perceived competence and outcome expectations.

452
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:16,390
So in this population, the perceived competence is going to be the ability to leave a relationship, to seek help.

453
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:17,330
I'm so sorry.

454
00:56:18,710 --> 00:56:26,870
Leave a relationship or feel that they have the ability to seek help and then outcome expectations is going to be the idea of whether or not

455
00:56:26,870 --> 00:56:33,140
they think that something good or bad will happen if they able to leave a relationship versus the benefits of staying in a relationship.

456
00:56:36,140 --> 00:56:40,730
And both of these then come together to inform help seeking and behaviors,

457
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:44,809
which is one of our outcomes that we're hoping to address in the help seeking behaviors,

458
00:56:44,810 --> 00:56:52,940
include accessing the IP help line, reaching out to meeting members or family members if they need help or resources.

459
00:56:53,990 --> 00:57:01,280
And basically, we're also doing this in a safe manner to not just trying to lead, but trying to help create a plan by doing so.

460
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:04,850
And yeah, access and community resources as well.

461
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:11,950
They're able to. So we really use this conceptual model to inform our intervention, which we'll get into on the next slide.

462
00:57:11,950 --> 00:57:18,379
But I just want to highlight that we're really trying to influence a couple areas across the different conceptual models.

463
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:21,700
So we're using education to address some of these individual beliefs.

464
00:57:22,090 --> 00:57:30,069
We're also using more style empowerment, which we'll get into to address some of the perceived competence.

465
00:57:30,070 --> 00:57:33,430
And then we're really leaning into the impact of social systems as well.

466
00:57:35,470 --> 00:57:43,930
So our intervention is an after school program for high school girls in grades nine through 12th grade that uses black feminist pedagogy,

467
00:57:43,930 --> 00:57:51,400
as well as other critical pedagogies and an empowerment framework to help reduce incident incidents of intimate partner violence.

468
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:55,060
So couple of things as to why we chose this intervention.

469
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:59,649
Like we talked about that target population and where we see most episodes or

470
00:57:59,650 --> 00:58:04,360
incidents of intimate partner violence happens in that 18 to 24 age range.

471
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:12,790
So we're trying to be as upstream as possible, trying to help girls to learn the signs and symptoms and how to feel empowered,

472
00:58:13,030 --> 00:58:17,590
to listen to the inner voice that tells them like this is a red flag earlier on,

473
00:58:17,830 --> 00:58:23,799
but also acknowledging that intimate partner violence can start in middle school girls and high school

474
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:29,440
girls and really at the point where people start learning about and exploring experiencing relationships.

475
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:36,459
So we think that's really important for groundedness. We also are planning to partner with high schools in the inner city,

476
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:44,140
and we're hoping to have this program run by health education specialists who are specialists in intimate partner violence,

477
00:58:44,470 --> 00:58:51,760
but also important nation with valued members of the community and trusted teachers to increase community buy in.

478
00:58:52,030 --> 00:58:58,419
And we really thought that it was important that this curriculum center had to go to some people of

479
00:58:58,420 --> 00:59:03,640
color because we really want it to be culturally responsive and makes sense for this community.

480
00:59:04,810 --> 00:59:10,840
And so hopefully with this intervention, we'll be able to address some of these goals, but we'll talk about those as well as we get into outcomes.

481
00:59:12,130 --> 00:59:16,810
So our key aspects of the intervention is that we're hoping to really increase self-efficacy,

482
00:59:17,110 --> 00:59:21,310
enhance that community and social support piece and reduce stigma.

483
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:31,270
And most of this is going to come through both the idea of what the curriculum is, as well as the just shared space that we're hoping to create.

484
00:59:31,270 --> 00:59:36,849
And, and with that some community. So increasing self-efficacy like I talked about,

485
00:59:36,850 --> 00:59:45,759
we really want to enhance how these young girls come to understand like signs of intimate partner violence, like what are red flags,

486
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:54,160
understand what they should seek in relationships and what are the benefits of a healthy relationship, what those things look like,

487
00:59:54,520 --> 01:00:04,180
and using that empowerment framework alongside that to help encourage them to speak up as they see red flags and to trust their gut, really.

488
01:00:05,020 --> 01:00:11,290
And then along with that, we're hoping to have this like shared space where we're helping to create community

489
01:00:11,290 --> 01:00:17,109
and address some of those communal norms that exist around intimate partner violence,

490
01:00:17,110 --> 01:00:23,319
which along with that includes a lot of the stigma about what is included in if you

491
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:28,030
were in an intimate partner violence situation or what help seeking looks like.

492
01:00:28,030 --> 01:00:35,169
So we're hoping to really enhance those social networks and help people to feel that within their community, their social support.

493
01:00:35,170 --> 01:00:39,999
And there's this belief that it's okay to seek help if they are to end up needing to seek

494
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:46,719
help and that they feel like just empowered with each other to help support other girls,

495
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:53,050
that they experience intimate partner violence or they mentioned that something is happening in their relationship.

496
01:00:55,380 --> 01:01:01,420
Yeah. So each of these key aspects works towards our proximal and distal outcomes.

497
01:01:02,620 --> 01:01:08,199
So overall, our goal is to reduce the incidence of intimate partner violence.

498
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:12,850
And in order to do so, we've outlined these personal goals.

499
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:21,250
One is increasing self efficacy, as we just mentioned, reducing stigma, including empowerment within a community,

500
01:01:21,550 --> 01:01:28,660
and then connecting and accessing resources such as counseling, safe spaces, support groups and medical care.

501
01:01:29,170 --> 01:01:36,940
And each of these proximal outcomes works to build upon our more broad and distal outcomes,

502
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:46,750
which on the next slide are increasing the percentage of women who are able to seek help and those who encourage others to seek help as well.

503
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:56,560
And then our main goal of decreasing overall incidence of intimate partner violence among inner city women of color.

504
01:01:56,920 --> 01:01:58,180
And then in doing so,

505
01:01:58,180 --> 01:02:06,970
we're hoping to reduce the negative health outcomes associated with IPV and the trauma induced injuries that people can incur with.

506
01:02:07,060 --> 01:02:21,640
I as well. And so overall, all of these work towards the main goal and all of them come together in reducing this overall incidence.

507
01:02:24,370 --> 01:02:39,690
That's really it. Thank you very much.

508
01:02:41,990 --> 01:03:18,000
Now, those of you. It's fine, but it's something you've got to put.

509
01:03:42,660 --> 01:03:48,960
All right. Hello, everyone. My name is Mohammed Kadir and this is McKenzie.

510
01:03:49,140 --> 01:03:55,890
I'm Chad. And we're going to be presenting today reducing the prevalence of obesity in African-American female adolescents.

511
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:07,120
So why is obesity? Obesity is basically a health condition that is characterized by excessive body fat or excessive BMI increases of the risk

512
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:13,540
of developing the serious medical problem or complications that could occur from obesity include cardiovascular disease,

513
01:04:13,540 --> 01:04:16,630
diabetes, stroke, high blood pressure and cancer.

514
01:04:19,570 --> 01:04:26,230
So some of the risk factors or other factors that could contribute to obesity is family inheritance,

515
01:04:26,270 --> 01:04:32,950
lifestyle choices, diseases, medications, social issues, financial situation or even age.

516
01:04:33,370 --> 01:04:38,110
These are different factors that could cause or contribute to obesity.

517
01:04:40,090 --> 01:04:47,710
So the prevalence of obesity in the United States right now, the prevalence of obesity in the U.S. is greater than 40%.

518
01:04:48,010 --> 01:04:50,050
That's mainly attributed to poor diet.

519
01:04:50,380 --> 01:04:57,700
So the prevalence has been trending upwards for the last two decades, but the lowest prevalence has seen in Asian Americans about 15%.

520
01:04:57,790 --> 01:05:01,480
The highest prevalence that's seen in African-Americans, about 50%.

521
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:07,050
So the medical cost of obesity is not cheap at all.

522
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:14,549
In 2020, the cost nearly reached $200 billion spent because of obesity,

523
01:05:14,550 --> 01:05:19,050
just due to all the different factors, like we said earlier, strokes and so forth.

524
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:22,500
So along with it comes a lot of treatments are needed.

525
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:31,530
So usually is it increased medical costs. So for our target population,

526
01:05:31,530 --> 01:05:38,430
we decided to focus on African-American female adolescents because they have the highest prevalence of obesity amongst us adolescents.

527
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:46,620
As you can see in this chart that we took from the CDC, 25% of female adolescents in this population have obesity.

528
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:55,740
All right. So some of the goals that we want to accomplish with this is improving DEI and

529
01:05:55,740 --> 01:05:59,340
increasing the rate of physical activity amongst within our population group.

530
01:06:00,330 --> 01:06:06,540
And then the goals are preventing obesity and preventing chronic disease associated with obesity.

531
01:06:09,290 --> 01:06:13,390
That's not going to go over the conceptual model. All right.

532
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:15,430
So we're working on this conceptual model.

533
01:06:15,430 --> 01:06:21,909
What we hope to accomplish was to develop a product that is easy to follow and understand something that is logical.

534
01:06:21,910 --> 01:06:29,440
And evidence based on a conceptual model is broken up into five components all the social determinants of health,

535
01:06:29,740 --> 01:06:31,810
individual and community characteristics,

536
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:38,410
behavior change constructs health behaviors that we intend to change and health outcomes that we hope to accomplish.

537
01:06:39,370 --> 01:06:43,720
Overall, this model was informed by social cognitive theory and health belief model.

538
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:50,460
For social cognitive theory. You're going to see the role of reciprocal determinism within this conceptual model.

539
01:06:50,470 --> 01:06:59,250
So, for instance, personal factors such as self-efficacy and outcome expectations make up a portion of our behavior change components.

540
01:07:00,340 --> 01:07:06,670
Social environmental factors like built environment, social support make up our individual and community characteristic component.

541
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:13,750
And finally, the behavioral factor of intent makes up part of our behavior change component as well.

542
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:21,550
For the belief model, we use constructs of modifying factors to inform the social determinants of health component.

543
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:30,370
We also used constructs of perceived barriers and benefits to inform behavior change constructs as well.

544
01:07:31,660 --> 01:07:37,150
So with that in mind, as I kind of go over this a little bit more that so reading this thing from left to right,

545
01:07:37,430 --> 01:07:42,640
you're going to have modifying factors such as race, age, gender and socioeconomic status.

546
01:07:43,450 --> 01:07:49,930
These are social determinants of health that impact individual and community characteristics are within our target population.

547
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:57,550
Specifically, we found that characteristics such as inherited risk knowledge and skills, built environment,

548
01:07:57,730 --> 01:08:02,800
mental health and social support, influenced perceived barriers and benefits tied to obesity.

549
01:08:04,660 --> 01:08:09,040
Not depending on whether or not the perceived barriers could be mitigated by the perceived

550
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:13,900
benefits is going to be dependent or is going to determine one's behavior one time.

551
01:08:15,010 --> 01:08:23,650
And now this prevalent component is dependent on social cognitive theory, constructs of outcome expectations and self efficacy.

552
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:28,089
This is important to note because an individual from our target population finds that

553
01:08:28,090 --> 01:08:32,290
our proposed interventions that we're going to mention shortly to be effective.

554
01:08:32,290 --> 01:08:36,099
This will lead to high self efficacy and improved outcome expectations,

555
01:08:36,100 --> 01:08:41,980
which is ultimately going to result in an improved diet, increased rate of physical activity within our target population,

556
01:08:42,730 --> 01:08:50,530
which is going to allow us to achieve our proximal, and thus the goals of improving diet and increasing physical activity and ultimately

557
01:08:50,530 --> 01:08:54,220
reducing the prevalence of obesity amongst or within our target population.

558
01:08:58,150 --> 01:09:00,940
So to reach our target population of black adolescents,

559
01:09:01,210 --> 01:09:08,470
we designed a community based intervention that focuses on parents in the Detroit area because Detroit

560
01:09:08,470 --> 01:09:14,020
has a particularly high obesity rate and also a large percentage of African-American residents,

561
01:09:14,020 --> 01:09:22,870
which we've discussed, also have high obesity rates. And in order to achieve our proximal goals of improving improving obesity related health

562
01:09:22,870 --> 01:09:28,390
behaviors and our distal goals of improving obesity rates and the related health conditions,

563
01:09:28,660 --> 01:09:31,420
we built an intervention that has three main segments.

564
01:09:32,350 --> 01:09:38,290
Parents will be invited to participate in this nine week intervention, where they will attend educational sessions,

565
01:09:39,310 --> 01:09:43,270
support group sessions, and then finally work together to plan to drive.

566
01:09:47,780 --> 01:09:53,240
So our first differentiates apparent eradication program, and this program can be divided into two parts.

567
01:09:53,270 --> 01:09:56,390
The first part is parent company two and behavioral change.

568
01:09:57,080 --> 01:09:57,830
And this part,

569
01:09:57,830 --> 01:10:05,000
our interaction is to provide parents within the community with an occasional course to teach them knowledge about nutrition and physical activity.

570
01:10:05,450 --> 01:10:12,590
So, for example, nutrition knowledge could include house eating behavior, like eating slowly and selecting a proper serving size,

571
01:10:13,010 --> 01:10:18,649
and also includes food choice, like how to purchase vote by reading labels and how to prepare our house balance.

572
01:10:18,650 --> 01:10:20,930
Go down meals and a physical activity.

573
01:10:20,930 --> 01:10:28,040
Education is more about how to choose the appropriate intensity of exercise and how to exercise that in a healthy way.

574
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:32,000
So there are five courses provided on different time being awake.

575
01:10:32,120 --> 01:10:37,700
So parents involved in this program need to attend at least a two courses a week based on their own choice.

576
01:10:38,150 --> 01:10:45,170
So this part of intervention is informed by social cognitive survey to accomplish cognitive and behavioral change.

577
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:53,720
The interaction teaches Paris knowledge and help them to acknowledge their ability to change their own eating patterns and physical activity habits.

578
01:10:53,900 --> 01:10:59,660
To believe that they are capable of imparting good eating and physical activity habits to their children.

579
01:11:00,170 --> 01:11:04,550
So self advocacy is an important construct in this precise of behavior change

580
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:09,050
because it determines how long a person will persist in the face of obstacles.

581
01:11:10,370 --> 01:11:19,100
So the second part of this intervention is environmental change, which aims to have a positive impact on our children directly.

582
01:11:19,340 --> 01:11:21,110
So in our later adaptation courses,

583
01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:29,930
parents can communicate with the course providers to explore how to apply this knowledge to their family and build a house, a family style lifestyle.

584
01:11:30,350 --> 01:11:35,209
So the key point of this part is that parents provide a major social learning environment

585
01:11:35,210 --> 01:11:40,400
for their children and in this way to utilize it to form a house lifestyle to prevent,

586
01:11:40,430 --> 01:11:44,400
obviously. So this part is also informed by social cognitive theory.

587
01:11:44,420 --> 01:11:49,610
The family actually provides a major social learning environment for the children and plays a role model.

588
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:56,750
So in this way, children may imitate their parents behaviors, and imitation is an indispensable aspect of learning.

589
01:11:56,960 --> 01:12:02,720
And the process of adopting a new behavior can be enhanced by the presence of proper social models.

590
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:10,340
And parents have significant influence on their children as serve as his or her first motto or behavior.

591
01:12:10,550 --> 01:12:18,530
So parents who overeat or eat fast or ignore their internal satiety clues provide a poor example for their children.

592
01:12:18,980 --> 01:12:25,459
It is up to them to pray that a house eating style in the hope an external social environment

593
01:12:25,460 --> 01:12:30,860
to model how C selection and consumption of foods and to engage in regular physical activity.

594
01:12:35,910 --> 01:12:43,950
To address our conceptual models, constructs of social support and self-efficacy, we propose implementing a community support group for the parents.

595
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:51,870
The group will meet regularly in a community location and will be led by community members with relevant expertise in obesity prevention.

596
01:12:52,770 --> 01:13:00,839
Support group activities will include discussing participant's recent successes and challenges in healthy eating and exercise setting,

597
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:07,290
goals about relevant health behaviors and identifying barriers to healthy eating and exercise to then brainstorm solutions.

598
01:13:09,810 --> 01:13:16,290
The aim to enhance social support through increased social engagement, by the selection of community experts as group leaders,

599
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:20,310
and by discussion of successes and challenges in practicing healthy behaviors.

600
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:27,780
Participants sense of relatedness will be bolstered by the enhanced social engagement and by allowing parents to connect with each

601
01:13:27,780 --> 01:13:33,840
other through sharing their difficulties and performing positive eating and exercise behaviors for themselves and their families.

602
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:40,710
A decision to train community members themselves as group leaders is likewise intended to enhance relatedness.

603
01:13:41,910 --> 01:13:48,410
These social interactions are also designed to influence behavior by generating group norms surrounding commitment to engaging in health.

604
01:13:48,420 --> 01:13:49,680
Promoting behaviors.

605
01:13:53,010 --> 01:13:59,550
The support group activities will also function to improve our proximal and distal health outcomes by building parent self-efficacy.

606
01:14:00,420 --> 01:14:05,040
Many of the models we've discussed in this class have featured self-efficacy or similar constructs.

607
01:14:05,610 --> 01:14:12,479
It's a main construct of the health belief model. It fits into social cognitive theory as a personal factor and appears in

608
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:16,710
self-determination theory as competence and into the theory of planned behaviors.

609
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:24,080
Perceived control group leaders will be trained to build self-efficacy through the methods laid out by self-determination theory.

610
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:28,650
And one of these includes reframing past failures as short successes.

611
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:36,170
Self-determination theory also supports the next three activities, which are discussing successes and challenges,

612
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:41,670
goal setting and identifying barriers in these work to an enhance self-efficacy.

613
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:47,720
And lastly, social cognitive theory and a theory of planned behavior.

614
01:14:47,730 --> 01:14:48,120
Likewise,

615
01:14:48,120 --> 01:14:56,190
support these activities because they pose that perceived control and self-efficacy are built through vicarious experience of similar other successes.

616
01:15:00,580 --> 01:15:04,510
Okay. Our last paragraph of our intervention is for dry.

617
01:15:04,810 --> 01:15:09,210
So this program is that parents in the community, while underserved,

618
01:15:10,740 --> 01:15:17,110
not develop an organization that's focused on building food drives to aid underserved and advantaged families in the community.

619
01:15:17,470 --> 01:15:20,590
So by delivering healthy food to disadvantaged families,

620
01:15:20,590 --> 01:15:26,290
we want to improve their food accessibility and address the issue of food houses versus food deserts.

621
01:15:26,860 --> 01:15:30,040
So this program is informed by cereal plan behavior,

622
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:37,690
which could account for factors that exist outside of people's volitional control that can influence intention and behavior.

623
01:15:37,960 --> 01:15:39,100
So if a controlled belief,

624
01:15:39,310 --> 01:15:46,600
our interest is to improve the accessibility to housing food in order to make people in the community program obviously a less difficult

625
01:15:47,230 --> 01:15:54,430
and the more perceived power the food drive could make people believe that they have consistent access to housing food options.

626
01:15:55,150 --> 01:16:02,140
So in this way, people in this community who have high perceived control will most likely engage in good eating behaviors,

627
01:16:02,150 --> 01:16:09,620
Ali, to decrease the risk of obesity. So lost our group experience.

628
01:16:09,740 --> 01:16:14,300
For me personally, I think in the process of making the conceptual conceptual models,

629
01:16:14,660 --> 01:16:18,290
there are some concepts and theories that is more abstract for me.

630
01:16:18,620 --> 01:16:23,720
So I think reading solid literature or just reading some existing conceptual models is

631
01:16:23,750 --> 01:16:29,330
very helpful for me to apply this abstract thing to real world public housing problem.

632
01:16:32,930 --> 01:16:37,190
I just want to throw like one of the limitations that we've had when doing our research

633
01:16:37,190 --> 01:16:43,190
was we found a lot of the studies were more towards adults opposed to adolescents.

634
01:16:43,250 --> 01:16:47,390
So it kind of made it a little difficult to find relevant data.

635
01:16:48,350 --> 01:16:49,610
So that was kind of a challenge.

636
01:16:49,640 --> 01:16:54,890
Another thing too is that I kind of liked how everybody within our group kind of came from a different background academically.

637
01:16:54,900 --> 01:16:58,430
So we were able to kind of bring in different skillsets to make this thing possible.

638
01:16:58,760 --> 01:17:02,780
And it was also cool because like public health, we know like interdisciplinary work.

639
01:17:02,780 --> 01:17:05,810
And so we were able to kind of simulate that within this project.

640
01:17:06,590 --> 01:17:28,730
I think. Another very excellent day of presentations and I continue to be blown away by how much you have applied what we've learned this past year.

641
01:17:30,410 --> 01:17:36,530
So great work, everyone. And we did an excellent job keeping us safe.

642
01:17:36,530 --> 01:17:45,530
So we saved us ourselves. 3 minutes. So be sure to fill out the survey that Dominique is sending you and then we'll meet again on Wednesday.

643
01:17:48,980 --> 01:17:52,200
So it was interesting, you know.

644
01:17:54,930 --> 01:18:03,650
I am. I think it's hard, you know.

645
01:18:06,980 --> 01:18:10,490
I'm sorry. That's all. Well, your group does.

646
01:18:15,660 --> 01:18:26,069
At the time, it was aware that, man, I don't know.

647
01:18:26,070 --> 01:18:50,580
I just don't want to sleep. But I feel like I have no idea what has changed.

648
01:18:51,720 --> 01:19:03,560
All right. So you just tell us what I'm saying.

649
01:19:03,700 --> 01:19:30,990
As long as you have someone other than someone just looking over my, like, 30 minutes and it's point to 5 minutes, I'm going to go.

650
01:19:31,710 --> 01:19:34,830
I'm going to go so I can get my exams.

651
01:19:36,990 --> 01:19:45,360
Yeah. Yeah.

652
01:19:46,240 --> 01:20:12,660
You know, I better get this stuff right, because I'm really, really, really, really trigger happy.

653
01:20:13,020 --> 01:20:17,160
Just like I really like women naturally have become a little bit adults,

654
01:20:17,630 --> 01:20:44,170
but they don't teach you me why women have higher than everybody else interacts with the right thing to say so.

655
01:20:44,230 --> 01:20:49,710
But I'm like, Yeah, yeah.

656
01:20:49,740 --> 01:20:55,800
I was like, Oh yeah.

657
01:20:56,460 --> 01:21:04,830
Especially when I actually I don't think, you know, you can tell.

658
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:11,850
Yeah, I was just coming up here to check this out.

659
01:21:13,080 --> 01:21:17,610
This is like, oh, I was going to say statement Wednesday.

660
01:21:17,830 --> 01:21:24,150
I want to play a little piece that goes to you.

661
01:21:26,160 --> 01:21:31,680
I like panic. We got to do one more.

662
01:21:33,730 --> 01:21:38,040
Yeah, yeah, right. Right. Yeah, me too.

663
01:21:41,070 --> 01:21:48,360
Because it's restaurants still like that. I'm like, yeah, well, you're also we were just at I was like, oh, but then I,

664
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:59,729
I don't think any of us how we all think of these things because I think this is what needs to be his last night.

665
01:21:59,730 --> 01:22:17,100
So I'm not going to be like, okay, I'm so glad it was me, but I just didn't work because I noticed like, oh, it doesn't fully go like,

666
01:22:17,430 --> 01:22:27,900
oh, let's try to my point, I have this text or I think it's about, you know, not about just the bomb actually, or anything.

667
01:22:28,230 --> 01:22:39,720
I mean, yeah, try it now. Everyone sounds is a powerful if you ask what they're doing online for the next week and it's really easy to delete 16.

668
01:22:40,170 --> 01:22:45,020
Oh, okay. Well, that's funny. I was on my way.

669
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:53,219
Yeah. Hi. Oh, I didn't realize it was right there.

670
01:22:53,220 --> 01:22:59,129
I thought it was on this site, so I thought I was being helpful. So let's see if it works sometimes.

671
01:22:59,130 --> 01:23:02,400
But that's hard to bring alcohol here. I know.

672
01:23:04,020 --> 01:23:08,460
Yeah. Yes.

673
01:23:08,890 --> 01:23:12,670
Because every one of us doesn't have a case.

674
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:19,390
That's that's just the same thing, but not me. I want to thank you for your support on this journey.

675
01:23:20,470 --> 01:23:30,630
You guys have already presented. You literally made my name that I can send mine from all over from America.

676
01:23:31,510 --> 01:23:35,590
So did I ever tell you about the concept? To my description?

677
01:23:35,740 --> 01:23:39,440
It's time for I'm done. Now, just let me know when you guys want to.

678
01:23:39,990 --> 01:23:43,600
To. I just saw your face.

679
01:23:43,710 --> 01:23:49,750
See? That's so funny. You know, if you don't do anything to me, she does.

680
01:23:50,530 --> 01:23:58,720
Which is why I was going to go to our screening. Just take one second to hear the directors offer.

681
01:23:58,810 --> 01:24:07,540
You know, nobody's walking across campus. Winced. I don't see the reason I was bothering you, remember?

682
01:24:08,170 --> 01:24:11,650
It's like our folks never let me get called.

683
01:24:12,150 --> 01:24:16,209
So, yeah, I'm gonna stay and do work, but everyone's like, I don't want to stay here.

684
01:24:16,210 --> 01:24:22,340
If you work some intervention of yours, and we have dignity.
