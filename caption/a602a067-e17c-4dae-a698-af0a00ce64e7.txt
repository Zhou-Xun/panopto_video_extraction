1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:09,900
Tuesday and Thursday. Hey, good morning, everyone.

2
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:17,470
Welcome back to your science and health. You've heard enough from me right already.

3
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:24,570
It's time for a break. We are so fortunate to have one of my close colleagues here in Environmental Health Sciences,

4
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:31,020
Professor Rick Neitzel, who just happens to be an expert on physical exposure.

5
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:40,020
And I'm just looking back and think of a screen that happens to be an expert on physical exposures.

6
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:45,659
So, yes, I can teach this material to you, but you are going to hear from one of the best.

7
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:52,590
And actually, I think we'll talk a little bit at some point in the lecture about his particular expertize.

8
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:59,640
Rick is one of the world's leading experts on noise exposure and some really cool research he has going on.

9
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:02,790
But I'll leave it to you to talk more in detail about that.

10
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,329
Anyway, thank you so much. The floor is yours. Thank you so much, Tim.

11
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:12,330
And good morning, everybody. I should say, you know, being a world's leading expert in noise, there's like three of us.

12
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:17,070
So basically leading experts or the worst in the field, depending on how you do this.

13
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:23,330
I'll also say Tim's absolutely right. He can teach about physical exposures, so I'm going to teach it this morning.

14
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:30,060
It's not going to be the most captivating material either way, but I will try to keep it light in the area.

15
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:34,650
It's sort of a set of pretty hefty topics and I want to move through them quickly.

16
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:41,700
But please do pause and, you know, raise your hands, shout out a question if you have them as moving along.

17
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:46,530
Actually, maybe I'll give you just a little bit of background on me.

18
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:49,620
So this is now my 11th year here at the university.

19
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:58,800
I direct our industrial hygiene program. I've focused much of my career on physical exposures or physical hazards.

20
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:04,970
We use those terms interchangeably with most of my work, having focused on noise.

21
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:11,250
And instead I also actually have the pleasure of chairing something called the Physical Agents Committee,

22
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:18,750
which is part of a group called the new CGI Agency. It's such a horrible long name, the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists.

23
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:25,170
You can see why they like the acronym. So this is one of the few organizations around the world that actually recommends

24
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:29,040
occupational exposure limits for different types of hazards in the workplace.

25
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:34,919
And so for the past four years, I've been chairing that committee and we put out recommendations or sort of

26
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:39,149
guidelines on all of these topics that I'm going to talk to you about today.

27
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:42,629
So that's that's been just a great opportunity. Nothing I ever set out to do.

28
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:45,690
But it's been a wonderful way to learn even more about these topics.

29
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:50,250
So in terms of what I'm hoping you get out of today's lecture,

30
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,240
hopefully you'll have a better sense of some of the sources and the health effects that are

31
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:59,400
associated with all of these different types of hazards or exposures that will run through today.

32
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:07,570
So we're going to start out with radiation and we'll talk about thermal stress and then we'll move on to human migration and we'll wrap up with that.

33
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:14,040
So as I said, it's kind of a property here of different physical hazards that people could face either in the workplace,

34
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,880
which is my primary interest, but certainly also in the community as well.

35
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:24,130
So with that short introduction, let's go ahead and roll into ionizing radiation.

36
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:28,400
And I'll tell you, as a member of Generation X, which I probably am,

37
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:36,230
the first thing that comes to mind for me when I hear the words ionizing radiation is essentially nuclear explosion.

38
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,929
So I can't speak for ten.

39
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:46,729
But my childhood, there was a sort of a constant threat of potential nuclear war, and that was kind of ground into, as we all learned,

40
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:52,070
of course, that if you could shelter under the flimsiest of school desks, you'd be completely immune to any nuclear blast.

41
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:58,370
That was very reassuring. But this is kind of what I think about when I hear the words ionizing radiation.

42
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:05,780
Some of you may also be familiar, for example, with the Chernobyl sound event that happened in 1986,

43
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:11,690
either because you read about it or maybe because you've seen that kickass HBO mini series, which is really great if you haven't seen it.

44
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:20,030
Some of you may know of our own sort of mini Chernobyl, Three Mile Island that occurred in 1979.

45
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:24,140
That was the closest our country has come to having a nuclear meltdown.

46
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:34,040
Some of you, probably most of you remember more recently back in 2011, the Fukushima junior reactor meltdown that occurred in Japan.

47
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:39,500
So while I envision nuclear weapons, there are certainly other things that may come to mind.

48
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:47,690
All right. I'm going to try to do it all everywhere, some of maybe logging into this earlier and it seems like it didn't.

49
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:52,520
Let's try this again. This is always the challenge.

50
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:56,610
What is the password here?

51
00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:00,050
Okay. So if you guys are on your devices,

52
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:07,070
I encourage you just to go to all every dot com forward slash our night Neitzel here and so I've talked to you now

53
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:13,940
about a couple of different sources or possibilities through which you might become exposed to ionizing radiation.

54
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:23,180
Now, I'd like to get your sense essentially, which of these do you think are more likely to give you ionizing radiation exposure and which are less?

55
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:31,340
So I'll give you all a moment to log in. I hope this works. I should say pull everywhere works for me maybe 50% of the time.

56
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:38,740
So we'll keep our fingers crossed that this is one of those times. And with any luck, we'll start to see some results roll in here.

57
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:43,220
So while you're pulling it up again, just thinking about your daily life,

58
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:48,280
which one of these things do you think might give you more of or less radiation exposure?

59
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:52,219
So food and water. Cosmic rays.

60
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:58,740
Radon. Indoor air pollution. Living within 50 miles of a coal fired power plant.

61
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:07,850
But also, we got here fallout from historical nuclear weapons tests, like I said, and living within 50 miles of a nuclear power plant.

62
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:15,490
All right. So we'll probably see these rankings jump around a little bit as folks are making their decisions.

63
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:22,549
That's fantastic. It looks like living within 50 miles of a nuclear power plant is up to sort of a clear lead.

64
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:26,300
Here is no sorry. Radon in indoor air. Now tied for first.

65
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:34,340
So it seems like folks are generally thinking cosmic rays and food and water or maybe not so much to be worried about here.

66
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:41,000
Radon indoor air going first, nuclear power plant second, coal fired power plant third.

67
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:45,650
And yeah, we've got now tied for for fifth or sixth.

68
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:53,000
So I'll let you just finish up here, but I can tell you your intuition here,

69
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:58,730
if you've been on an indoor air, what's first is in fact absolutely correct.

70
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:08,090
So if we actually rank these sources in terms of the exposure to radiation that a typical American would get over the course of a year,

71
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:13,330
in fact, radon in indoor air is far and away the leader here.

72
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:20,630
So we'll talk a little bit about the numbers or the units that we use to describe ionizing radiation here, the MG.

73
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:27,319
So that's one representation basically of how much radiation got into a person's body, for instance.

74
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:32,899
So for radon in indoor air, for a typical American, it's something like 200 milligrams per year.

75
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:38,480
You can see that's five times higher than the next highest category, which actually is food and water.

76
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:46,940
Down in 40 milligrams. The typical person gets about 26 mg of radiation every year just from cosmic rays.

77
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:50,030
So that's radiation coming into Earth's atmosphere from space.

78
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:57,380
You know, despite my childhood fears of nuclear fallout, it turns out fallout from the historical nuclear weapons test.

79
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:01,100
We have had a ban on atmospheric tests for four decades now.

80
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:06,139
You get a tiny contribution from some of those historical tests living there.

81
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:12,290
A coal fired power plant is down at about 0.03 mg and living near a nuclear power plant,

82
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:18,140
which seemed like the class that was about number two on the list, as you can see is.

83
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:26,600
Like six orders of magnitude less radiation exposure than you get just from breathing radon in typical indoor air.

84
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:33,350
In fact, you can see this is just by far the lowest exposure potential that you have on here.

85
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:39,500
Now, that's assuming normal operating conditions. Of course, if there's a meltdown or something, those numbers could change radically.

86
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:44,590
But for a typical operating nuclear plant, you are getting virtually no radiation from that.

87
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:50,600
So you can see our perception maybe as members of the public in terms of where the risk is coming from,

88
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,040
in terms of radiation may not necessarily match kind of the reality.

89
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:58,280
So this is a good opportunity for us to kind of reset our perception.

90
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:04,340
So let's take a moment here and we'll go through some very rudimentary physics.

91
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:10,880
We'll move through this very quickly. But just sort of trying to understand, well, where does the ionizing radiation come from in the first place?

92
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:16,760
So if all of you remember maybe back to high school where you learned about the composition of an atom,

93
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:24,530
you remember hopefully that there's a nucleus at the center of an atom and there's also protons and neutrons within that.

94
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:32,000
So you've got this sort of tight bundle of protons and neutrons that make up the nucleus of any atom.

95
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:36,950
Now, protons are positively charged. Neutrons don't have a charge.

96
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:44,269
We know that if the number of protons is different than the number of neutrons, that's going to result in some instability.

97
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:48,440
And atoms don't like to be stable if they are unstable.

98
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:56,239
So if we get that sort of disagreement basically between the positively charged protons and neutrons,

99
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,640
we're going to end up with an atom that wants to decay.

100
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:06,080
And in doing so, it's going to release electromagnetic radiation, basically, or it could release particles of radiation, as we'll talk about.

101
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:13,160
So that's the nucleus. And again, if it is unbalanced, we're going to end up with instability and radiation getting emitted.

102
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:18,980
We've also got circulating in orbit around that nucleus, some electrons.

103
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:24,170
And so ideally in a stable atom, the number of electrons is equal to the number of protons.

104
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:29,660
We've got an equal number of positive and negatively charged elements here.

105
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:33,200
If there are a different number of electrons and protons,

106
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:41,870
we're going to have an ionized atom here and an ionizing atom is going to also emit electromagnetic radiation.

107
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:46,219
So basically when we talk about radiation, we're just talking about atoms that are unstable.

108
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:50,810
We're trying to get to a stable state. And the way they do that is by emitting radiation.

109
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:58,879
Now, I'll throw the term radiation out here quite often in this lecture you might ask yourself,

110
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,810
Well, why are we specifically talking about ionizing radiation here?

111
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:11,540
Are there other types of radiation? And it turns out there are we call radiation ionizing, essentially, if it has if an element, for instance,

112
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:19,669
has enough or enough energy that it's able to essentially remove electrons from other elements or atoms in it,

113
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:23,030
which can cause those atoms to become charged or ionized.

114
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:32,120
And so the amount of energy that it takes to be ionized depends on the particular element or type of atom that we're talking about.

115
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:38,149
But there's a range sort of generally accepted that somewhere between ten and 33 electron volts,

116
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:45,049
if you've got more energy than that coming out of an atom that's going to be called the ionizing radiation will not have to remember those numbers,

117
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:48,020
just sort of giving them to you for the reference.

118
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:55,560
So I mentioned that there's a couple of different types of ionizing radiation, and this turns out to be pretty important.

119
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,800
So we've got alpha and beta, which some of you may have heard of.

120
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:06,630
And then Gamma and X-ray, I'm sure all of you have heard of Gamma because of course, that's what created the whole range to ground this.

121
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:13,980
In reality, an X-ray is probably most, if not all of you have had an X-ray at some point in your life for medical imaging purposes.

122
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:19,250
So those you may be more familiar with, but alpha and beta turned out to be pretty darn important here.

123
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:24,210
So alpha radiation is essentially we've got an atom again that's unstable.

124
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:31,890
And to get stable, basically that atom will kick out two neutrons and two protons.

125
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:37,470
So this is basically the core of a helium atom that this initial atom is kicking out.

126
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:43,380
And it's doing that again to get stability. It's getting rid of excess energy and trying to get to a more stable state.

127
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:49,740
Now, alpha radiation is actually a particle, so it's it's a couple of protons and a couple of neutrons.

128
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:59,520
In terms of radiation, this is considered a pretty massive, a heavy and generally pretty short range type of radiation.

129
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:08,340
So alpha radiation is essentially emitted by some of the heaviest radioactive elements, things like uranium, for instance.

130
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:16,200
Now, beta radiation occurs when we have a single neutron in the nucleus that converts to a proton and ends up getting,

131
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:22,080
as a result, an electron that sort of gets spit out of the nucleus here, kind of ejected from its house.

132
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:28,790
And so now in this case, for beta radiation, we've got a single electron just getting kicked out of the atom and floating along.

133
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:37,830
This is much less massive, much less dense than the two neutrons and the two protons that make up and alpha particles.

134
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:46,950
So a beta particle is very small, it's very light, and as a result, it can travel much, much farther than an alpha particle.

135
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:57,750
Beta radiation is produced by sort of a diverse range of different unstable elements and then gamma and X-ray radiation that these

136
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:06,540
things typically occur after there's already been sort of an attempt by the atom to get stable by emitting alpha and beta radiation.

137
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:13,290
And when we talk about gamma and X-ray radiation, we're no longer talking about sort of particles of radiation.

138
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:19,739
Now we're talking about photons. So these are movements of energy that don't have mass or charge to them.

139
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:23,670
And because they have no mass, they can travel very, very far.

140
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:31,650
So these are kind of the three major categories that we need to be thinking about when we are worried about ionizing radiation.

141
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:42,270
And the reason I bring these up is because the type of radiation is very relevant to how bad this radiation might be if you come into contact.

142
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:51,749
So if we imagine all these blue circles, here are some human tissue and we've got different types of radiation interacting with that tissue.

143
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:56,520
Well, let's let's talk about what happens. So I've already talked to you about alpha particles.

144
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:03,210
Again, these are massive. They're very heavy. They don't tend to travel very far, but they've got a lot of energy in them.

145
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:08,280
So what this means is they don't tend to penetrate very far.

146
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:11,190
So this is not something that's going to zip all the way through you.

147
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:18,600
They're actually pretty easily stopped because they're big, but they have a lot of the energy that gets imparted at that first surface.

148
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:25,320
So Alpha is again something that we're not going to be concerned about zipping all the way through us.

149
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:32,549
But if it's contacting certain tissues, this is dead skin on the outside of my body maybe.

150
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:35,670
And that's some worried. But this is tissue inside my lung.

151
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:40,090
Very delicate, sensitive tissue. I might be much more worried about that alpha region.

152
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:46,299
As I said, Vader particles are much, much smaller. They have much better penetrating ability.

153
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:49,450
So Vader radiation is going to tend to go further into us.

154
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:55,150
Instead of depositing all that damage at the surface, it's going to kind of spread the damage throughout its path.

155
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:59,980
And then gammas and x rays again are pure energy.

156
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:02,559
They've got no mass. They are the most penetrating.

157
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:09,220
So these are going to zip all the way through you and continue on out the other side and again distribute their damage along the way.

158
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:15,220
So this is why we can use X-ray radiation for medical imaging, right?

159
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:19,209
It's not as if the radiation gets absorbed in your body. It actually travels through.

160
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:24,040
And then we can have that energy imparted on a film plate and we can see, okay,

161
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:31,420
now areas of relatively more density on this film plate would show more density in your body bones, for instance.

162
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:40,810
And areas that don't show such a change might be soft tissues, basically, that the gamma or x ray can sift through much more easily.

163
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:49,150
So again, that kind of the penetrating power of radiation is pretty important when we think about health outcomes.

164
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:55,570
Something else that we always have to be concerned about for radiation is the concept called the pathway.

165
00:16:56,380 --> 00:17:03,850
And so we use the same equation to think about radiation half life that we do for a half life of a chemical in your body.

166
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:10,240
So you may all know if you end up getting a chemical inside your body, your body's naturally going to excrete that.

167
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:17,970
And we can talk about the half life in terms of how long does it take your body to clear half of that chemical, whatever it is, out of your body?

168
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:21,129
We can think about the same thing in terms of radiation.

169
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:27,070
So if I have a big chunk of contamination that's generating radiation, how long is it going to take?

170
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:31,090
For half of that radiation to be emitted is half of the total amount of radiation

171
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:35,350
it's ever going to be emitted from that particular source contamination.

172
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:38,860
And here we've got a huge range of half lives.

173
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:46,780
So some of you may know Uranium 238. This is something that's been used for nuclear power generation and weapons creation.

174
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:53,109
Unfortunately, a half life there on a planetary scale of four and a half billion years.

175
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:57,669
So this is stuff that once it's in the environment, it's not going anywhere.

176
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:59,860
It's going to be around for quite a long time.

177
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:09,310
And plutonium 239 And again, another particular atom that's been used extensively for weapons development has a shorter half life.

178
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:13,360
It's only about 24,000 years, but that's still a quite long time.

179
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:18,219
If you think about the kinds of chemicals that we might deal with in the environment,

180
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:25,110
typically the half lives there on the order of maybe days or months or decades, not tens of thousands of years.

181
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:31,720
So when we think about radiation, this is just a much different time scale than we're used to dealing with with environmental hazards.

182
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:37,360
Another element that some folks may have heard of is carbon 14.

183
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:44,169
Does that ring a bell? Anybody know what carbon 14 when it just shout out what we might use this for using carbon dating.

184
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:48,100
Exactly. So for this particular radio isotope,

185
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:55,059
we can look at how quickly it's decayed and based on how much carbon 14 is there in comparison to other types of carbon,

186
00:18:55,060 --> 00:19:02,800
we can say, well, here's how old this particular material is that's useful for dating, fossils, shipwrecks and all sorts of things.

187
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:12,879
A half life there on the order of 5700 years. But then, as I said, there's also radio isotopes or elements that have shorter half lives.

188
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:19,870
So Cesium 137 is used in medical imaging, among other purposes, and that has a half life of about a month.

189
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:27,970
Tritium has a half life of about two weeks. And radon, what you will talk about, Warren has a half life of just under four days.

190
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:35,440
So again, the the type of radiation we're dealing with dictates how much of that radiation is going to get deposited in our body.

191
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:42,160
And the type of element the radiation is coming from is going to dictate how concerned we have to be about this stuff.

192
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,760
Are we thinking on the order of days or weeks or months or, you know,

193
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:51,430
on the order of like half of the age of the entire planet and everything in between?

194
00:19:53,340 --> 00:20:02,160
So when we are talking about ionizing radiation, we're typically interested in sort of how much radiation is actually being made.

195
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,110
So one of the ways we quantify that is trying to estimate, well,

196
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:13,500
how many atoms in a particular chunk of of contamination that it's generating radiation, how many atoms are getting in a given period?

197
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:19,830
Maybe a second. And so some of you may have heard the term theory used before.

198
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:25,469
That's one of the units that we use here in the United States to talk about radioactivity, of course,

199
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:34,170
because in virtually every sense of measurement, we use different units than the rest of the world does in terms of the metric system.

200
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:35,730
They use units called Becquerels.

201
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:44,340
One of the things we're interested in, in addition to just how much radiation is there, is how much is actually getting into our body.

202
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:50,549
So typically we're concerned about human health here. And so we can talk about the absorbed dose.

203
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:53,760
And so here we can use units of rads.

204
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:59,250
And those are what we use in the United States or in the international system, use units of grays.

205
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:05,640
And then really what we're most interested in is what we call the effective dose.

206
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:12,150
So you might imagine just kind of intuitively, gosh, if I get a big blast of radiation to my fingertip,

207
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:19,480
that's probably a different sort of health outcome than a big blast of radiation to my brain or to my kidneys or to my heart.

208
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:26,610
You're absolutely right. So we can actually adjust the dose depending on the organs that are getting it here.

209
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:35,220
And this is really what we're typically interested in. And so in the United States, we use units of RAM or MG more commonly.

210
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:38,970
And again internationally they have an equivalent unit called a sievert.

211
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:42,490
So really, it's this effective dose that we're most interested in.

212
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:47,580
How much is getting into me and is it getting into organs that are especially sensitive to it?

213
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:55,640
All right. So let's do another quick poll everywhere just to get you guys moving and engaged.

214
00:21:56,300 --> 00:22:02,300
So the question now we've got is which of these activities, again, has the greatest radiation exposure?

215
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:06,260
So certainly got an early vote in four, two days living in Denver.

216
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:14,870
We've got another vote for one coast to coast airline flights a year next to a nuclear plant.

217
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:18,559
And maybe you're all weary of that one after our discussion earlier.

218
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:21,710
But still, we see some some folks voting for that one.

219
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:29,480
Know you may know that there are some types of watches that use slightly radioactive paint to mark their dials so you can see them.

220
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:31,190
They're essentially glow in the dark.

221
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:39,950
And we've got a year of watching TV, so nobody wants to take that one because, oh, my God, if that's bad for me, that's not good news.

222
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:49,010
And three days living in Atlanta. Okay, so looks like folks are still making their entries here.

223
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:53,840
Seems like one coast to coast airline flight is sort of in the lead here.

224
00:22:54,890 --> 00:23:04,920
We give it just a few more seconds to wrap it up. All right now.

225
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:08,100
Looks pretty stable. So can anyone tell me why?

226
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:12,210
What? I want you to be especially concerned about an airplane flight here.

227
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:20,260
Any thoughts or rationale for why you chose that one? Why?

228
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:30,690
48% of you chose that one. Yeah, please. So you're higher up in the atmosphere, so you're getting more radiation from the sun and cosmic rays?

229
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:40,260
Absolutely right. So. So when we're in an airplane flight altitude, we might be off maybe 35,000 feet or about seven miles above the earth.

230
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:44,190
That means there's much less atmosphere between us and the cosmos.

231
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:47,880
So we're getting a lot more cosmic radiation that ends up getting down to sea level.

232
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:52,980
That's also why I made a distinction here between two days in Denver, which is,

233
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:57,650
you know, the mile high city versus living much closer to sea level in Atlanta.

234
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:05,550
So as we increase in elevation, we're going to end up getting more radiation exposure from the cosmos for a given time period.

235
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:11,650
Again. Glad to see folks are not so alarmed about the nuclear power plant here.

236
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:16,500
Some of you didn't think the watch was the leading agent here.

237
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:20,910
I'll jump ahead to the answer and tell you it's actually a trick question.

238
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,790
All of those give you about the same dose.

239
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:31,360
So for each of these activities, you're getting about one milligram of radiation and again, a very trivial quantity.

240
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:33,099
But you can start to see, you know,

241
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:42,580
the amount you get from watching TV for the year is also approximately the amount you get from wearing the watch with over this dial for a year.

242
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:46,900
And that's equivalent maybe to just a five hour airplane flight.

243
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:54,820
So you can get more or less radiation over a very short time period or, you know, for example, if your exposure.

244
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:59,740
So apologies for the trick question, but I just wanted to illustrate that for you.

245
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:07,479
Pivoting here to the health effects of radiation, which is what most of us are perhaps worried about here.

246
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:11,170
We've got two major kinds of health effects that we're concerned about.

247
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,880
One is called deterministic.

248
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:21,130
So these are sort of acute health effects, things that are going to happen typically within minutes, 2 hours, two, maybe days of you being exposed.

249
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:24,370
And then we've got so-called stochastic or delayed effects.

250
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:32,710
So these are effects that will often have or will often manifest, maybe years or even decades after your exposure.

251
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:38,440
And so a highlight here. We actually have two different so-called dose response curves.

252
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:43,810
So what we're trying to relate here is the amount of radiation dose someone is getting from none or all the way up to a lot,

253
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:47,680
and then essentially the effect of radiation damage.

254
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:54,310
And so for these deterministic effects, again, this is kind of for acute responses.

255
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:59,469
You can see we actually have a sigmoid or stage dose response curve here.

256
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:07,060
So it's not a straight line. We end up having not much effect down at the low levels and a very steep rise in the impact that we get.

257
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:16,990
And then it starts to sort of level out here. So when we think about this, stochastic effects, again, those were longer term effects here.

258
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:24,160
We think there's a much more linear association between basically the probability that you're going to get cancer,

259
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:27,190
for instance, and the amount of radiation you see.

260
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:31,090
I'll also highlight here, you'll see this threshold.

261
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:38,620
So a threshold, meaning if I'm below some value of radiation exposure, I'm not going to get any help.

262
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:44,739
And so if you look at deterministic effects here, we can see, in fact, we actually do think there's a threshold.

263
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:52,720
So if you have a short term, relatively intense exposure to radiation, here's a level below which you're not going to be harmed at all.

264
00:26:53,680 --> 00:27:02,380
So we want to be below that threshold ideally. On the other hand, when we talk about these stochastic effects, so this is more long term impacts,

265
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:07,750
you can see we don't actually ever cross down at the origin here.

266
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:13,850
So basically any radiation exposure you get, we think is going to cause some, you know,

267
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:17,950
potentially infinitesimal, but some increase in your risk of a health outcome.

268
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:24,130
So again, in terms of acute impacts, we do think there's a threshold below which you're not going to be harmed.

269
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:29,990
But over the long term, you know, any radiation, unfortunately, is going to increase your risk slightly.

270
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:37,870
Now, I don't mean to alarm you because we should recognize that every organism on earth has evolved over time in the presence of radiation.

271
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:43,240
We're all getting radiation exposed constantly. We have mechanisms in our body to repair the damage.

272
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:47,440
So I don't want you to think, oh, my God, I've been exposed to radiation. I'm going to get sick.

273
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:55,720
The trick we have is trying to tease out of sort of background incidents or spontaneous incidents of some diseases,

274
00:27:56,170 --> 00:27:58,180
what do we think might actually be attributable,

275
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:03,910
which becomes especially difficult when you're thinking about exposures that might have happened decades ago.

276
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:09,520
How much do we think that exposure might have contributed to some particular health effects?

277
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:15,370
So let me give you some examples of some of these different kinds of health effects that I'm talking about.

278
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:23,650
Excuse me. I'll highlight. As you can see from the image here, there's lots of different systems that can be impacted by radiation.

279
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:28,660
In fact, virtually every system in the body is going to be harmed if we have a high enough exposure.

280
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:35,710
But I mentioned, you know, a year of watching TV or one coast to coast flights going to give us like one milligram of exposure.

281
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:40,209
A single chest x ray might give us maybe ten milligrams of exposure.

282
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:46,300
And you can see we start to climb up here. So down at the bottom here we're in MG, some thousands of a REM.

283
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:52,120
We get up to maybe one day here, which we might get as an exposure.

284
00:28:52,120 --> 00:29:02,349
For instance, if we get a full body computed tomography scan or a CT scan, just as a point of reference for nuclear workers,

285
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:07,900
what we're typically aiming for for those folks is to keep them at two REM per year or less.

286
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:16,240
Now 40 REM. So this again is orders of magnitude higher than what you and I are getting on an annual basis.

287
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:21,910
That was the highest amount of power radiation that was measured at the Fukushima meltdown.

288
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:26,940
And I should highlight here and to remember last, we're down in this green zone.

289
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:33,880
Really it's it's an exposure that we don't really have the ability to even link to any health outcomes because it's so small.

290
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:41,499
So this is kind of the Green Zone. When we get up to this Fukushima level of 40 REM, you know, no really immediate symptoms,

291
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:46,480
but there might be a substantial increased risk of cancer, for instance, later in life.

292
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:54,250
And when we get up into this high risk zone of, say, 200 REM, so that's about well,

293
00:29:54,250 --> 00:30:01,960
it's let's see, like 10,000 times more than what most people are getting in a typical year.

294
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:06,939
If you hit 200 REM, you're very likely to get what's called acute radiation sickness.

295
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:13,120
And that's going to well, we'll talk about that more in a few moments if you get 500 REM.

296
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:19,420
So this is an incredibly high amount of radiation. Half of the people with that exposure are going to be dead in 30 days.

297
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:23,830
And if you get a thousand REM, everybody is going to be dead within a couple of days.

298
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:28,929
So if we think about this compared to other environmental hazards, you know, typically we're like, well, you know,

299
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:31,390
you wouldn't want to be exposed to high levels of benzene,

300
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:36,010
but if you are exposed to high levels of benzene, you know, you might get cancer decades from now.

301
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:41,649
It is possible that you could breathe in enough benzene, that you can poison your central nervous system and die immediately.

302
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:49,030
But that's very rare. And we can't necessarily predict with great accuracy how many people are going to die at that exposure.

303
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:56,319
Whereas for for some of these very high levels of radiation, we have extreme confidence like this is a lethal level.

304
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,979
We know that based on empirical evidence from the past.

305
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:05,140
So so we do have some pretty good understanding here. And again, the types of injuries we might get here.

306
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:11,559
It turns out your stomach is extreme. The lining of your stomach is pretty darn sensitive to radiation exposure.

307
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:14,290
Of course, your reproductive organs are highly sensitive.

308
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:20,680
Your lungs can be damaged, you can get ocular damage or maybe cataracts from high levels of radiation.

309
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:28,870
Your skin can be burned, you can get damage to your bone marrow and then potentially leukemia, for instance, and other health outcomes.

310
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:36,250
So so lots of sort of immediate results that can happen with a high enough dose of exposure of radiation.

311
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:42,370
But on the other hand, if we think about these more late or stochastic health effects here,

312
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:46,300
we're not worried about burns to your skin or cataracts or things like that.

313
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:52,690
Primarily, we're concerned about cancer and there is essentially no type of cancer that can't be linked to.

314
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:59,469
In particular. So you can see there's a whole list of target organs here in virtually every

315
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:04,240
organ in the body is potentially at risk from high enough exposure to radiation.

316
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:07,990
The other thing, though, that we have to worry about is genetic effects.

317
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:14,770
So it's possible that you don't develop cancer, but that your DNA are altered from that radiation exposure,

318
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:19,140
and then you can pass along some heritable defects that might show up in your kids.

319
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:24,130
So that's an especially sort of alarming prospect about radiation.

320
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:31,809
Now, in terms of cancer risk, it turns out your risk really begins at an exposure of about ten grams.

321
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:39,190
So recall, that's much higher than what most of us are getting, you know, orders of magnitude higher than what most of us are getting.

322
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:43,000
And if you had a single exposure of 100 REM.

323
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:52,270
Sorry. So if we're all kind of in this moderate risk area of the chart, we have a single exposure at 100 REM.

324
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:57,000
We think that's going to result in maybe a 5% increase in cancer risk over your lifetime.

325
00:32:57,010 --> 00:33:00,570
So, again, I don't want you to think, oh, my God, I've had radiation of cancer.

326
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:07,980
It's not that likely. But certainly the more radiation you have, the more likely cancer risk becomes.

327
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:14,240
So I mentioned now that there's lots of different things that might expose us.

328
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:19,810
We talked about full body scans. We've talked about cosmic rays and chest x rays.

329
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:23,979
Just to put this in in sort of terms of, well,

330
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:32,010
what am I getting compared to what a nuclear plant worker might that I said we try to keep nuclear plant workers below about two REM per year.

331
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:37,190
But in fact, in the United States, we actually have a limit of five REM per year.

332
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:44,200
So if you were an operator at a nuclear power plant, we would be monitoring you every day of your career there.

333
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:50,829
And we would want to make sure that in any given year, you never got a total of more than five REM of radiation.

334
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:51,910
And if you did,

335
00:33:52,510 --> 00:34:00,880
then we would remove you from that job and put you in a different non exposed position for the rest of your workers are very tightly monitored.

336
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:04,880
Again, we're trying to keep them below five REM per year here in the.

337
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:14,080
Most of us are going to get on a personal level something around 600 milligrams per year or six rem per year.

338
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:22,030
So we're getting, again, several orders of magnitude less than what a person in a nuclear plant might get.

339
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:29,020
And I'll tell you that while we might get this total amount from all the types of radiation were exposed to,

340
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:33,069
we actually have a limit that says if you live near a nuclear plant,

341
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:37,990
you can't get more than 100 milligrams per year from that plant or that plant's going to have to be shut down.

342
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:42,969
So there's very strong limits in place to make sure that nuclear workers are protected and to

343
00:34:42,970 --> 00:34:47,470
make sure that the radiation from that nuclear plant isn't getting out into the community.

344
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:54,910
Again, just thinking about all of us kind of on a typical basis.

345
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:58,000
Where is our radiation coming from, coming from?

346
00:34:58,690 --> 00:35:07,120
If we look at the whole US as a population, it turns out some people, older folks tend to get a lot of medical imaging done.

347
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:12,160
And so for the typical American, about half of their dose comes from medical imaging.

348
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:15,610
Now, you're all presumably young and healthy. This probably doesn't apply to you.

349
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:23,530
But if we look at the population as a whole, about half of our exposure comes from medical sources, about a little over a third.

350
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:27,430
It comes from breathing in radon. And so we're on an indoor air.

351
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:33,430
And then, as you can see, we've got some other sort of smaller contributions here from cosmic radiation,

352
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:37,629
from internal radiation, from consumer radiation.

353
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:44,320
So again, if you've got that luminous dye on your watch that's giving you a little bit of exposure, you also,

354
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:51,310
most of you hopefully have a source of ionizing radiation in your home that's designed to help protect you.

355
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:55,570
Anybody know the consumer product in your home that might have radiation in it?

356
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:05,840
Scary to think about. It's put there purposely. It's very safe. Yes.

357
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:10,290
Well, it turns out smoke detectors actually have a small amount of radiation in there.

358
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:16,210
They use that radiation to help detect smoke particles. So we should all have smoke detectors in your home.

359
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:21,540
You don't go out and get one. And that's the reason why you don't just toss smoke detectors in the trash when

360
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:25,560
you're done with them because they actually have a little bit of radiation in them. So we want to dispose of them properly.

361
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:32,069
So let's talk a little bit more about radon and I'll tell you a story here.

362
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:37,440
When I moved to Ann Arbor from Seattle, where I live previously,

363
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:46,110
you can see Seattle here on this national county map of radon sort of probability is in a yellow zone, meaning basically this is low potential.

364
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:53,849
So I had never given any thought to radon when I lived in Seattle and my family and I moved to southeast Michigan here,

365
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:59,270
which you can see is in a red zone, meaning we have the highest potential for radon exposure.

366
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:01,860
We moved here. I was not aware at all.

367
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:09,630
We rented a home on the west end of town that had a basement playroom for my daughters, who were playing down there constantly.

368
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:16,229
I moved here in September. January rolls around and someone told me, Hey, it's National Radon Awareness Month.

369
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:20,580
I was like, Why not? You know, just they were given this any thought. And I was like, Why should I should test this?

370
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:27,479
This is kind of what I do. And so we did a test of radon in our basement and discovered that the levels

371
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:31,680
in my daughter's playroom were five times over the federal recommendation.

372
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:35,009
So that's pretty alarming. Again, it's a short period of time.

373
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:42,120
So no real health risk, but but very concerning. And so the EPA, the Environmental Protection Agency,

374
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:50,909
has done surveys tens of millions of measurements across the U.S. and figured out which counties are at more or less risk of radon exposure.

375
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:58,380
So you can see here there's a distinct geographic pattern, the south and southeast, not especially high levels,

376
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:03,750
the upper plains and Midwest and parts of the Northeast have pretty darn high levels.

377
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:06,360
And so this is due purely to geology.

378
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:15,180
So it turns out wherever you see red here are areas where there tend to be high concentrations of uranium in the soil.

379
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:22,440
And uranium, as it decays, ultimately creates a daughter product called radon.

380
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:26,340
And so wherever we've got uranium deposits, we tend to have high radon.

381
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:33,450
Now, I will say, while you might think, well, gosh, every place in Washtenaw County has to have high levels, that's absolutely not the case.

382
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:37,530
This is on a home by home basis. So for instance, we tested our basement.

383
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:41,910
It had extremely high levels. The neighbors then tested theirs and they had none.

384
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:47,190
So it's pretty unpredictable. And this is why it's so important actually to test your home.

385
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:55,829
So for $10, you can get a test kit from Washtenaw County Environmental Health and they will send you instructions,

386
00:38:55,830 --> 00:39:01,170
send you the kit, you'll send it off to a lab and tell you how much radiation is present in your home.

387
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:02,880
So I encourage all of you to do this.

388
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:12,540
I'll also highlight radon is pretty important because it turns out to be the leading cause of lung cancer among smokers in the United States.

389
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:16,949
So radon kills more people than drunk driving and false and things like that.

390
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:20,100
So it's a serious matter.

391
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:29,280
Fortunately, it's also something that's really easy to fix if you find you have a problem in your home and relatively inexpensive to do so.

392
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,640
I've included a map in case you guys want to look up where you live.

393
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:36,420
You get the link here in the slides. I encourage you to take a look.

394
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:44,080
But regardless of whether you're in a high or low potential zone, really the only way to know is to test at your home yet.

395
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:50,520
Please. I've heard that it's only in basement. Just a lie or it's a great question.

396
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:56,370
So radon is one of the heaviest naturally occurring gases, so it does tend to settle to the lowest spot.

397
00:39:56,910 --> 00:40:01,140
So when you test your home, you want to test the lowest level of the home that you live here.

398
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:06,179
So like if you have a crawlspace underneath your house, most of you probably don't live in the crawl space.

399
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:13,440
No need to test there. You test on the lowest level. Eventually, however, lots of homes will have air intakes in the basement,

400
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:18,959
meaning that when you have your ventilation on your your cooling fan or your heating,

401
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,920
for instance, it's pulling air from the basement and moving it throughout your house.

402
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:29,520
So we it may naturally want to be in the basement, but it can be spread through ventilation to every level of your house.

403
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:35,100
Typically, though, if you don't have a problem in the basement, you're not going to have a problem the other one's basement.

404
00:40:35,370 --> 00:40:39,090
And if you don't have a basement, then it would just be the first point in the testing. Good question.

405
00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:46,419
Also highlights the EPA has an estimate for your radiation dose.

406
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:51,330
So if you're kind of curious, what might my dose be on an annual basis, you've got a link there.

407
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:59,519
And I'll point out, radiation is, you know, a substantial enough threat to public health that we have a whole radiation monitoring network read net.

408
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:04,620
So you can see all of these measurement locations around the entire United States, including a bunch of.

409
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:14,590
Michigan are designed to help us know if there's been a release or an emergency at a plant, we can serve the public.

410
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:22,660
This has also been used historically to figure out, well, are other countries testing nuclear weapons, radiation emissions?

411
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:28,360
So just one final question for you before we shift away from ionizing radiation.

412
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:30,969
I'm curious what what jobs, of course,

413
00:41:30,970 --> 00:41:36,700
all of you are going to go out and become environmental health professionals or occupational health nurses or other degrees.

414
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:44,620
We may not have so much exposure in our professions, but what jobs are out there that you think might actually have potential for radiation exposure?

415
00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:50,490
Yeah, please. X ray technicians. X ray technicians. Excellent.

416
00:41:51,510 --> 00:42:03,620
Who else out there might have reduced exposure? Highlands Islands.

417
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:10,160
Sure. Flight crew in general. So again, if they're spending time at 35,000 feet every time they're in that plane at work,

418
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:16,370
they're getting a much higher exposure than you and I down here at 772 miles.

419
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:28,140
Miners. Miners, sure. So, you know, you might have exposure at 35,000 feet.

420
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:35,920
You might also work 20 feet underground and you breathing in radon gas or other uranium byproducts.

421
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:39,890
So, yeah, we can get an elevation. We can also get it underground.

422
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:47,180
So those are great ideas. It turns out there's actually a ton of jobs out there that potentially have radiation exposure.

423
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:56,090
So x ray technicians and really all the other folks who do different types of medical imaging with nuclear medicine, but also like your dentist.

424
00:42:56,270 --> 00:43:00,110
And if you have a pet, your veterinarian might be taking x rays of your pet.

425
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:07,820
Of course, people that work in nuclear plants, lots of researchers are involved in research that,

426
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:12,770
let's say, includes radiation and people who check out,

427
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:21,440
you know, sort of trucking and shipping containers are often X-rayed to look for illegal cargo or human smuggling, things like that.

428
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:26,450
So lots of different jobs out there that have some potential for violence and radiation exposure.

429
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:32,719
All right. So let's take the opportunity to kind of pivot away from ionizing radiation.

430
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:36,170
And now we're going to talk for a few minutes about non ionizing radiation.

431
00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:43,520
So analyzing radiation, as I said, is radiation that has enough energy to actually ionize an atom.

432
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:47,150
And all of these other non-ionizing sources still have energy.

433
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:53,990
It's just not enough to actually ionize or strip away atoms from stripped away electrons from other athletes.

434
00:43:53,990 --> 00:44:01,760
And so you'll see we've got this whole spectrum here. We've already talked about x rays and gamma rays, and I guess I didn't emphasize this,

435
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:05,450
but really the problem with radiation is that it damages our DNA.

436
00:44:06,050 --> 00:44:13,360
We've got all sorts of other types of non ionizing radiation that can create currents in our body,

437
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:20,180
the electrical currents that can cause heating of our tissues and that can maybe cause some optical effects for us.

438
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:30,770
So let's talk about this. So something that all of us are exposed to constantly is extremely low frequency, non-ionizing radiation.

439
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:41,240
So the power lines that we power very efficiently around our country can actually cause burns if we're close enough to them and get into this field.

440
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:50,480
There's also been for some decades questions about, well, gosh, if you are living underneath a high voltage power line.

441
00:44:51,170 --> 00:44:57,079
So the problem here is some of you may know our electricity cycles 60 times per second.

442
00:44:57,080 --> 00:45:02,900
So we have 60 hertz electricity alternating current delivered here in the United States.

443
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:10,360
So every time the direction of the electricity reverses in the power line, it induces a field in our bodies.

444
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:16,820
So we've essentially got this constant flip flopping 60 times per second reversal of polarity here.

445
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:21,530
And there's been a thought that, well, gosh, if you live very close to these fields in your kitchen,

446
00:45:21,530 --> 00:45:27,349
for instance, maybe you're at risk of getting severe or reproductive effects or developmental effects.

447
00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:30,919
So that's a theory that's been out there for decades now.

448
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:38,120
There's really no conclusive evidence that living near a high voltage power line is going to give you an increased risk of cancer.

449
00:45:38,510 --> 00:45:41,360
But, you know, it continues to be explored. It's a possibility.

450
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:48,229
The other thing is, any time you're an electrical field, electrical fields are always accompanied by a magnetic field.

451
00:45:48,230 --> 00:45:54,590
And so now we can have this magnetic fluctuation within our bodies that can be especially

452
00:45:54,590 --> 00:45:59,329
problematic if you have a cardiac pacemaker to help your heart maintain a certain heart rate,

453
00:45:59,330 --> 00:46:08,659
because that can be reset by magnetic energy. You know, for anyone who's ever had an MRI imaging test done, you know,

454
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:12,830
it's a quite large machine with a series of magnets that move it high speed around.

455
00:46:12,830 --> 00:46:19,900
You create a huge magnetic field. And I will say, you know, in addition to sort of chronic risks of maybe, you know,

456
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:24,649
cancer and so forth, it's also possible that things get sucked into that MRI with you.

457
00:46:24,650 --> 00:46:26,360
And this does happen from time to time.

458
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:33,830
Or you will read about some police officer whose gun got sucked out of their holster into the MRI or a medical bed they got.

459
00:46:35,150 --> 00:46:40,400
That's my my best representation of what that would look like from an MRI monster perspective.

460
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:49,280
So there's there's risks there in terms of direct injury. We're also all exposed constantly to radio frequency and microwaves.

461
00:46:49,670 --> 00:46:56,990
So radio frequency are the frequencies that are driving all that data to your cell phone and letting you talk to people from your phone.

462
00:46:57,710 --> 00:47:01,700
The primary issue for radio frequency in microwaves is we get tissue.

463
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:07,370
And so there's essentially behavior disruptions that occur.

464
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:11,870
So particularly as your brain starts to heat up, you can start to behave radically.

465
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:13,190
Maybe that makes good sense.

466
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:20,190
And in fact, workers who work on microwave towers who have potentially high exposures can get what's called microwave sickness.

467
00:47:20,190 --> 00:47:23,720
So while they're up on the tower, they may get headaches, they may get dizzy,

468
00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:30,890
which is really a concern when you're 200 feet off the ground, irritability, sleeplessness and memory loss, etc.

469
00:47:32,490 --> 00:47:39,840
When it comes to optical radiation, probably everyone has heard of infrared radiation or ultraviolet radiation.

470
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:47,249
So we've got a whole series of frequencies here in the ultraviolet range, in the visible range.

471
00:47:47,250 --> 00:47:51,660
So the visible range or the frequencies of light that we can actually see with our eyes.

472
00:47:52,290 --> 00:47:59,040
And then we've got the infrared range here. A lot of the health effects here are also associated to some degree with heating.

473
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:05,520
So we can start to get, for instance, retinal burns or corneal burns that are exposed to too much infrared energy.

474
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:13,560
We could get potentially cataracts. We could get erythema or reddening of our skin from ultraviolet light.

475
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:17,700
That's why you put sunscreen on. And we can also get some thermal skin burns.

476
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:24,270
And the little trace here is essentially showing how efficiently these different frequencies penetrate the skin.

477
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:29,700
So it turns out this particular range between infrared A and infrared B,

478
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:36,659
we get the deepest penetration of that energy and you can get the burn out of the surface of your skin, but actually in your tissues.

479
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:45,080
So that's certainly something that. Michael. You know, lots of folks out there having read radiation if you've ever worked in a kitchen.

480
00:48:45,290 --> 00:48:49,490
There's a lot of infrared radiation from the stove and others.

481
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:57,709
There are also glass blowers. If you've ever seen somebody blow glass by hand, you know, they have this bubble of molten glass.

482
00:48:57,710 --> 00:49:01,400
It's emitting a huge amount of infrared energy very close to their eyes.

483
00:49:01,910 --> 00:49:05,360
So, in fact, as is the case with lots of diseases,

484
00:49:06,050 --> 00:49:12,340
a lot of what we know about cataracts is things we've learned from people like glass blowers who got cataracts from work.

485
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:18,709
We also use infrared energy to our advantage so we can do a scan of a house, for example,

486
00:49:18,710 --> 00:49:25,910
and figure out how is the heat escaping from that house so we can identify leaks and seal those up and look more sustainable.

487
00:49:27,050 --> 00:49:34,760
We've also got ultraviolet light, and so U.V. is again what we're primarily concerned about when we put on sunscreen.

488
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:39,340
So we know that ultraviolet light can cause erythema or reddening of the skin.

489
00:49:40,130 --> 00:49:45,260
We know that skin cancer is particularly associated with UVB.

490
00:49:46,070 --> 00:49:54,460
We also know that aging of the skin is associated with UVB and the skin will become tougher with higher exposures to you, you see.

491
00:49:54,470 --> 00:50:00,270
So when you're buying your sunscreen, you want to be buying sunscreen that's effectively blocking it.

492
00:50:00,290 --> 00:50:06,700
UVB. A lot of sunscreens will say blocks you be a that's not really the kind of ultraviolet light that we're most concerned about.

493
00:50:06,710 --> 00:50:12,890
We're buying a sunscreen. Also, ultraviolet light can certainly harm our eyes.

494
00:50:12,890 --> 00:50:16,190
So it turns out ABC and UVB can inflame your cornea.

495
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:26,209
If ever any of you have been out, for instance, on a very bright day in the snow, we're out on the water with very intense light.

496
00:50:26,210 --> 00:50:31,670
You may feel at the end of the day, like you've got grains of sand in your eye or in your eye.

497
00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:35,840
That's something called photo keratitis, also called snow blindness.

498
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:41,270
So that, again, is inflammation of your cornea that will resolve when you get out of those conditions.

499
00:50:42,050 --> 00:50:46,160
And we do think that ultraviolet light is also linked to cataracts as well.

500
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:50,659
And we've. A few minutes. 999 is a radiation.

501
00:50:50,660 --> 00:50:55,280
And I meant what I said. So that's actually all I'm going to say about nano non-ionizing radiation.

502
00:50:55,280 --> 00:51:06,220
Any questions about that before we move on? So let's switch to something that's a little more familiar, perhaps thermal exposure here.

503
00:51:06,790 --> 00:51:12,050
I tried to search for some cartoons to liven up the lecture here.

504
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:17,230
It's pretty slim pickings online, so hopefully that's mildly entertaining.

505
00:51:18,010 --> 00:51:23,800
So when we think about thermal exposure, you know, we can all be out on a hot summer day and have thermal exposure.

506
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:31,750
There's some jobs that tend to have very high exposure. So anytime you return to school or visual arts, high potential for exposure.

507
00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:35,800
As I said, people who work in kitchens tend to have a lot of thermal exposure.

508
00:51:36,850 --> 00:51:44,080
People who work outside the courtroom, workers, farmworkers at the road, workers I've got here are getting kind of a double whammy.

509
00:51:44,410 --> 00:51:50,950
Road works typically done in the hot summer months, and you're working with this hot asphalt product on top of that.

510
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:54,269
You know, agricultural workers specifically,

511
00:51:54,270 --> 00:52:00,630
we have dozens of agricultural workers die every year in this country just from working in conditions that are too hot.

512
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:08,970
We can also think about first responders. So firefighters put on this turnout gear to protect them from flames, among other things.

513
00:52:09,330 --> 00:52:15,540
But that turnout gear also holds heat in and they're working very hard so they can oversee, in fact, inside that suit.

514
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:23,460
And then, of course, as we think about a warming planet, all of us are having more and more thermal exposure as temperatures increase.

515
00:52:24,930 --> 00:52:29,760
So when we think about thermal stress, there's a number of key factors we have to keep in mind.

516
00:52:29,790 --> 00:52:36,010
One of them is heat production. So all of you are generating heat right now just by being alive.

517
00:52:36,030 --> 00:52:40,430
You've got a basal metabolic rate. And then, of course, you know,

518
00:52:40,650 --> 00:52:47,760
right now none of you are working especially hard and struggling to stay awake while you work at learning physical hazards here.

519
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:55,400
But if you were construction workers out shoveling, you would be, you know, generating a lot of internal body heat through that work as well.

520
00:52:55,410 --> 00:53:03,270
And so your overall metabolic rate is the sum basically of how much heat you're generating just to stay alive,

521
00:53:03,270 --> 00:53:08,670
plus the heat you're generating through work. So that's what's produced inside your body.

522
00:53:09,270 --> 00:53:12,410
But then, of course, our body is interacting with the environment around us.

523
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:16,720
And so we've got a number of ways that we exchange with the environment.

524
00:53:16,730 --> 00:53:21,390
So one of them is evaporation as we sweat and the sweat evaporates off our skin.

525
00:53:21,430 --> 00:53:26,339
That's a tremendous cooling benefit that we get. We also have radiation.

526
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:32,690
So if we're near a hot surface, we might get infrared transfer of energy that's going to heat up our body.

527
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:34,980
We can have convection.

528
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:44,640
So any time we've got air or a liquid moving across our body that can either keep away from us or it can deposit heat into our body.

529
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:53,080
And then we've got conduction as well. And conduction we don't typically worry about it, except for maybe two or two particular scenarios.

530
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:58,290
One is if you're working in a kitchen, as I said, and you put your hand on the stove, you're going to get burned.

531
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:02,610
That's a conductive burn. The other thing, which is not a problem this time of year,

532
00:54:02,610 --> 00:54:07,739
but in a few months will be is when you're standing outside waiting for the bus to get to class,

533
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:13,620
you're going to notice your feet get cold first because your feet are in direct contact with the cold ground.

534
00:54:13,710 --> 00:54:18,000
So you get conductive heat lost that way. So if you don't have them already, get some good.

535
00:54:19,650 --> 00:54:24,300
Really what we're worried about in terms of thermal stress is what we call the heat storage rate.

536
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:29,910
So if I have a positive heat storage rate, that means my body is heating up, storing more and more heat.

537
00:54:29,910 --> 00:54:33,660
And if I have a negative heat storage rate, that means my body is losing it.

538
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:42,470
Now, when we talk about thermal stress, there's really just a couple of well, there's a host of things that we might be at risk of.

539
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:46,799
We could get prickly heat, essentially a skin rash.

540
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:50,040
We could get into syncope or fainting from heat.

541
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:55,860
Those things are relatively minor. The two that we're really worried about, our heat exhaustion and heat stroke.

542
00:54:56,610 --> 00:55:02,009
So for heat exhaustion, basically, we're right at the body's limit of its ability to cool itself.

543
00:55:02,010 --> 00:55:05,940
So we're sweating as hard as we possibly can. We may be dizzy.

544
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:11,849
We might have low blood pressure because our body is putting all of our blood into our extremities to try to lose heat.

545
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:16,740
We might be weak. We might be nauseous. This is a red flag.

546
00:55:16,770 --> 00:55:18,680
Heat stroke is what can actually kill you.

547
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:25,680
So heatstroke happens when you transition out of heat exhaustion and your body is no longer able to effectively cool itself.

548
00:55:26,250 --> 00:55:33,389
So whereas for heat exhaustion, you're going to be sweating as hard as you can when you get into heat stroke, your skin is going to be dry and red.

549
00:55:33,390 --> 00:55:37,080
You're not sweating anymore because you don't have any liquid left to sweat.

550
00:55:37,770 --> 00:55:41,459
Typically, you're going to be confused. You're going to have a very high core body temperature.

551
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:47,000
You may faint, you may people, so you may die. And so heat stroke is really what we're trying to prevent.

552
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:51,000
And in doing so, ideally, we're preventing heat exhaustion as well.

553
00:55:52,530 --> 00:55:56,549
Now, there's a lot of ways to measure thermal exposures.

554
00:55:56,550 --> 00:56:03,970
So I think I will go through each of these things individually, but I'll say we have different aspects of temperature we can measure.

555
00:56:03,990 --> 00:56:10,950
So really what we're trying to get at at the end of the day is what is the temperature that the human body would perceive in this condition?

556
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:16,229
So we need to account for evaporation, conduction, convection, radiation,

557
00:56:16,230 --> 00:56:21,300
all those things that are going to influence our health and our perception of heat.

558
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:29,460
So we've got a number of ways that we can measure and we can combine all of those things into what's called a wet bulb globe temperature.

559
00:56:30,030 --> 00:56:36,389
So this accounts for the air temperature, the humidity, the speed of the air blowing in process and rain heating.

560
00:56:36,390 --> 00:56:41,760
And again, that's kind of our best estimate of the actual conditions our body is experiencing.

561
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:45,080
That's something we can just measure in the environment.

562
00:56:45,090 --> 00:56:51,240
Sometimes we're even more concerned about a particular worker, and so we could actually have them wear a device that measures their own.

563
00:56:51,510 --> 00:56:59,100
Personal temperature, typically in their ear canal over the course of a day or even sort of more invasive,

564
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:05,009
we could actually have them swallow a thermometer pill that passes through their system over the course of a day or so.

565
00:57:05,010 --> 00:57:11,400
And that pill can send through telemetry information to someone else who can say, okay, this worker is doing fine.

566
00:57:11,410 --> 00:57:13,500
We're looking at their internal body temperature.

567
00:57:14,010 --> 00:57:19,070
That is way more popular than the alternative, which is to take a rectal body temperature over the course of the day.

568
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:25,860
You can imagine nobody's superrich, you know, in terms of limits that are out there.

569
00:57:26,190 --> 00:57:31,200
Excuse me for heat. I said this kills dozens of workers every year, always.

570
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:38,680
And yet we don't have an OSHA limit. So the Occupational Safety and Health Administration does not have a particular limit for 14.

571
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:42,989
They have something called the general duty clause, which says that if you're an employer,

572
00:57:42,990 --> 00:57:48,510
you have to provide a place of employment that's free of recognized health and safety hazards,

573
00:57:49,140 --> 00:57:55,410
meaning that an inspector from OSHA could walk out of a field and they can't say, Oh, you're violating the heat stress standard.

574
00:57:55,410 --> 00:58:03,540
But they could say any reasonable person would look at these conditions and say that worker is at real risk of, you know, fainting, collapsing, dying.

575
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:06,660
So I'm going to cite you for not providing a safe workplace.

576
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:13,660
HGH. The group I said that I'm a part of actually does have a recommended limit here.

577
00:58:13,670 --> 00:58:20,989
That's called a threshold limit value. And this limit is a combination of what is the wet bulb globe temperature,

578
00:58:20,990 --> 00:58:27,830
basically our our best guess at how the body is perceiving heat and a combination of that and your metabolic rate.

579
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:34,129
So as you might imagine, if you're not working very hard, you can probably tolerate higher temperatures.

580
00:58:34,130 --> 00:58:41,110
But the harder and harder you're working, the lower and lower the temperatures are the tolerated because you're creating all that internal life.

581
00:58:43,170 --> 00:58:47,520
That last slide was for the sort of workforce this one is for the public.

582
00:58:47,530 --> 00:58:55,139
So probably most of you have heard of the index. This is a combination of the air temperature and humidity, same basic concept.

583
00:58:55,140 --> 00:59:01,200
It's just not quite as accurate as predicting sort of human perceptions.

584
00:59:01,740 --> 00:59:09,000
But you can get the idea here that for higher and higher amounts of humidity in the air, in higher and higher temperatures,

585
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:17,340
we get into this red zone here where it's very, very dangerous to be out exercising or working in a high temperature, high humidity conditions.

586
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:21,900
All right. Switching now to two cold stress.

587
00:59:22,170 --> 00:59:27,030
Again, the cartoons I had available to me were limited, although I have to say, I think this one's pretty hilarious.

588
00:59:27,030 --> 00:59:33,089
But that's that's just been so, you know, heat stress is maybe more of a concern this time of year.

589
00:59:33,090 --> 00:59:39,749
But over the next couple months, we will inevitably switch more to a cold stress situation.

590
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:43,110
So I'm curious again, just kind of thinking about work environments.

591
00:59:43,110 --> 00:59:49,570
What kind of jobs or work environments might have potential exposure to cold, cold stress?

592
00:59:50,650 --> 00:59:54,900
Yeah, construction workers and machines in winter. Yes, absolutely.

593
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:58,290
So when I moved here from Seattle, I was like, oh, my, I think we're going to winter here.

594
00:59:58,290 --> 01:00:03,059
That's insane. It's so cold. And I'm like, Well, it's cold, but it's manageable.

595
01:00:03,060 --> 01:00:06,510
So construction to have outdoors in winter is a great example.

596
01:00:06,990 --> 01:00:14,280
Other jobs or yeah, please. People work in like butcher like things because they have like sure.

597
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:19,019
So anybody who's around them in food preparation or a butcher shop where they might be in a walk in freezer.

598
01:00:19,020 --> 01:00:22,350
Very cold. Did you ever watch it? Yeah, I was going to say food packaging.

599
01:00:23,130 --> 01:00:26,520
Food packaging. Absolutely both. Good examples. What's your one over here?

600
01:00:26,670 --> 01:00:33,569
Postal workers. Postal workers. Right. So, you know, neither rain or snow nor all the other conditions will stop the postal worker,

601
01:00:33,570 --> 01:00:36,930
they're absolutely out there under every condition imaginable.

602
01:00:36,930 --> 01:00:38,820
So those are great examples.

603
01:00:39,420 --> 01:00:48,240
I'll kind of amend those to also say, you know, really anybody who's doing natural resource extraction, so oil and gas workers,

604
01:00:49,170 --> 01:00:53,010
folks who are out doing research, maybe collecting ice samples,

605
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:59,100
people who work in walk in freezers, and there's sort of the food angle for walk in freezers.

606
01:00:59,100 --> 01:01:05,480
But we also use this for research. We've got lots of these freezers in the building, and there's kind of a, you know,

607
01:01:05,510 --> 01:01:12,690
a very unique circumstance here where you can go from heat stress to cold stress almost immediately.

608
01:01:13,140 --> 01:01:20,430
So if you think about shoveling snow, for those of you who have shoveled snow before, you know, when you're out there actually shoveling,

609
01:01:20,430 --> 01:01:28,470
it's quite intense work and you will heat up very rapidly, oftentimes maybe stripping off a few layers because you're overheating.

610
01:01:29,070 --> 01:01:35,940
But the second you stop shoveling the snow, if you don't have someplace warm to get to all that sweat you just created, it's going to freeze onto you.

611
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:42,420
And you can pivot from, you know, potentially heatstroke all the way to hypothermia in the space of even a few minutes,

612
01:01:43,050 --> 01:01:48,480
which is why I don't shovel snow, I guess is a long way of saying it's way too dangerous to let the machines do that.

613
01:01:50,010 --> 01:01:55,200
So when it comes to cold or whatever I'm really worried about here, all of you will notice this in the winter months.

614
01:01:55,200 --> 01:02:00,480
You know, the first kind of sensation you'll have is, well, I'm losing manual dexterity in my hands and fingers.

615
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:03,959
That's unpleasant, but not harmful, really.

616
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:06,870
We don't start to get concerned until we get down to temperatures where you might

617
01:02:06,870 --> 01:02:11,429
get frostbite or physical damage because your skin is freezing or hypothermia,

618
01:02:11,430 --> 01:02:19,500
where your core body temperature is melting far enough that you are at risk of losing consciousness or even dying.

619
01:02:20,580 --> 01:02:25,139
I'll emphasize this. It's true in Michigan in the summer. It's also true in Michigan in the winter.

620
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:27,480
Clothing is very important, especially in the winter.

621
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:36,180
We want to have clothing that provides good insulation, is breathable and allows permeation of water but will keep us dry.

622
01:02:36,190 --> 01:02:42,809
Of course, layering is really critical too. So in terms of temperatures here, I've included this complicated table.

623
01:02:42,810 --> 01:02:51,330
I'll just mention that all of us have an approximately normal temperature that we can take rectally and a slightly lower temperature in our mouths.

624
01:02:51,330 --> 01:02:58,739
That's much easier to measure. You know, shivering is our primary mechanism for heating ourselves up.

625
01:02:58,740 --> 01:03:04,979
It's not nearly as effective as sweating it, is it reducing heat stress so you can only shiver so hard.

626
01:03:04,980 --> 01:03:08,820
So by the time your core temperature is down about 95 degrees,

627
01:03:08,820 --> 01:03:14,490
you are shivering as hard as you possibly can if we get down to a core temperature of 91 degrees,

628
01:03:14,490 --> 01:03:18,540
so again, that's about eight degrees colder than it should be.

629
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:27,420
We start to get severe hypothermia. But I'll point out, you know, we quite purposely lower people's core body temperature is much lower than that.

630
01:03:27,420 --> 01:03:33,629
So we might take someone's core body temperature down to the fifties or even the forties for the

631
01:03:33,630 --> 01:03:38,940
purposes of inducing hypothermia medically to do very delicate operations like heart surgery.

632
01:03:39,750 --> 01:03:45,120
So just getting cold isn't necessarily going to kill you. It. If you were in a hospital, then they're doing this purposely.

633
01:03:45,540 --> 01:03:51,299
But certainly we know that if your core temperature is getting down into the high seventies and you're out on your own,

634
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:54,570
the chances are you're going to become unconscious and potentially freeze to death.

635
01:03:57,050 --> 01:04:01,090
All of you have probably heard of the wind chill chart that I've got displayed here.

636
01:04:01,100 --> 01:04:11,329
So this is, you know, sort of akin to the index that I showed you earlier where as temperatures decline and wind speeds increase,

637
01:04:11,330 --> 01:04:21,319
it's going to feel colder and colder. So fortunately, we rarely in Ann Arbor get down into these really cold sort of dark zones,

638
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:25,190
but we will hit the light blue zones here in the course of the winter.

639
01:04:25,190 --> 01:04:29,299
So, you know, if the air temperature is high and there's no wind, we're not really concerned.

640
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:35,690
But again, lower temperatures and higher wind speeds essentially reduce the time it takes for you to get frostbite.

641
01:04:35,810 --> 01:04:42,780
Fortune. And I will just acknowledge that winter is coming no matter how much I don't want that to be the case.

642
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:51,270
All right. So two more topics to cover here. We'll move through them quickly in our sort of race through the physical hazards here.

643
01:04:51,660 --> 01:04:56,879
So the next thing I want to talk about is human vibration. We really break this into two types.

644
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:59,220
We've got hand, arm or segmental vibration.

645
01:04:59,230 --> 01:05:06,850
So if you imagine you're using a power tool that vibrates, mostly vibrating your hands and arms, or we have whole body vibration.

646
01:05:06,870 --> 01:05:15,179
So, for example, if you're sitting on a piece of machinery that's vibrating around now, your entire body vibrates with any type of vibration.

647
01:05:15,180 --> 01:05:17,820
We're really interested in measuring the acceleration.

648
01:05:17,830 --> 01:05:23,820
So what's the change in the velocity of this particular surface you're in contact with over time?

649
01:05:24,990 --> 01:05:28,530
Vibration exposures are not uncommon, at least in the workplace.

650
01:05:28,530 --> 01:05:36,360
We think there's on the order of about 8 million total workers who are exposed to hand, arm or whole body vibration or both.

651
01:05:37,290 --> 01:05:39,749
For the community, we really don't have any good estimates here,

652
01:05:39,750 --> 01:05:45,290
but you might imagine every time you get into a car or you ride a bus or you're riding on an airplane or a train,

653
01:05:45,330 --> 01:05:48,090
you're getting your vibration exposure that whole time.

654
01:05:48,090 --> 01:05:53,820
We just don't have good estimates of how how big are those exposures and how regularly do they happen.

655
01:05:55,730 --> 01:05:59,809
So if we think about human vibration, it's it's a little bizarre.

656
01:05:59,810 --> 01:06:08,990
But like back in the 1950s, there was this whole movement that said, gosh, if you can vibrate your tissues, you can like vibrate the fat away.

657
01:06:09,380 --> 01:06:14,060
So people would essentially strap themselves to these devices and the devices

658
01:06:14,060 --> 01:06:17,750
would shake them and they would just hope that they would lose weight that way.

659
01:06:18,590 --> 01:06:21,190
That was largely discredited in the 1960s.

660
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:31,790
And yet I notice if you go on through Amazon today, you can buy vibrating exercise equipment that allegedly will reduce your your body fat.

661
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:38,870
Now, the key difference, I think, between this belt, which just was vibrating literally in your belly fat and melting it away,

662
01:06:39,260 --> 01:06:45,499
and the devices you see today is the devices today are whole body vibration devices where essentially you're standing.

663
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:51,799
And the idea here is as the surface below you is vibrating, your core is tensing up to hold you solid.

664
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:55,250
So it's actually exercise rather than just melting the fat away.

665
01:06:55,790 --> 01:07:04,790
There are way better ways to lose body fat than either. Yes, this is the bottom line there, because if whole body vibration eliminated body fat,

666
01:07:04,790 --> 01:07:09,790
there would never be an obese bus driver or taxi driver or farm worker.

667
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:17,600
You know, there's just clearly no association here with the jobs that tend to have very high levels of vibration exposure.

668
01:07:19,490 --> 01:07:23,940
One of the things we're concerned about with vibration is this concept of resonance.

669
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:32,120
So it turns out that if you apply vibration to your body, your tissues have a natural frequency that they want to vibrate at that sort of innately.

670
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:42,350
And so when we're focused on vibration, exposure really are key outcome is to prevent vibration in our core system.

671
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:50,030
So we don't want our cardiac area vibrating in the frequencies that the heart is most sensitive to.

672
01:07:50,330 --> 01:07:54,710
We don't want our eyeballs vibrating at a particular frequency that makes it very difficult to see.

673
01:07:55,220 --> 01:08:02,750
So we've designed limits to, again, kind of reduce the amount of vibration we get to these various components of our body.

674
01:08:04,370 --> 01:08:11,059
Now in terms of how we measure vibration, all of you who have a smartphone have a device that's measuring vibration constantly.

675
01:08:11,060 --> 01:08:17,150
So the little accelerometers in your phone that let you play video games and know the orientation of your phone.

676
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:23,570
Those are accelerometers. We use the same type of technology to measure vibration in environments.

677
01:08:24,170 --> 01:08:31,399
We have devices that essentially fit into your hand here so we can measure how much vibration is coming from the joystick,

678
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:37,490
for instance, into your hand. Or we have a device that everybody uniformly calls the whoopee cushion that you

679
01:08:37,490 --> 01:08:41,840
can sit on that essentially measures how much your whole body is vibrating.

680
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:46,909
And so we can measure how intense is the vibration and how long does the exposure last and

681
01:08:46,910 --> 01:08:53,000
start to figure out if this is potentially problematic when it comes to hand arm vibration.

682
01:08:53,030 --> 01:08:57,049
The health outcome is the very logically named hand arm vibration syndrome.

683
01:08:57,050 --> 01:09:04,520
So I love a clear name there. Typically, this is something that starts out as tingling or numbness in the extremities your fingertips.

684
01:09:04,940 --> 01:09:11,950
And then if you have more and more exposure, your fingertips will start to blanch or turn white and you may start to lose sensation in them.

685
01:09:12,110 --> 01:09:20,210
So that's sort of the hallmark of early hand arm vibration syndrome can start to spread to your entire finger.

686
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:26,520
And if this is continuing to occur without intervention, ultimately this can lead to gangrene.

687
01:09:26,540 --> 01:09:35,480
Now, we rarely see conditions like this anymore, but for instance, when gas powered chainsaws first came out in the 1940s and fifties,

688
01:09:35,780 --> 01:09:42,200
this was not an uncommon outcome among loggers, where using these things was their only source of livelihood and they would,

689
01:09:42,460 --> 01:09:49,300
you know, basically destroy their hands doing this job. For whole body vibration, the health effects are a little less clear.

690
01:09:49,330 --> 01:09:54,940
We know absolutely that flight vibration is linked to spinal pain or low back pain.

691
01:09:56,140 --> 01:10:00,640
If you're exposed to continuing kind of ongoing whole body vibration,

692
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:07,030
you can actually lose a couple of centimeters of height that you will recover after you stop the vibration exposure.

693
01:10:07,810 --> 01:10:13,510
You know, any of you who have ever been on a boat and not felt so great or maybe thrown up, that's a motion.

694
01:10:13,510 --> 01:10:17,800
Sickness is a result of very low frequency, full body vibration.

695
01:10:18,370 --> 01:10:23,500
And it's possible that whole body vibration is also linked to hypertension or cardiovascular disease.

696
01:10:24,580 --> 01:10:29,800
All right. Now, coming into the home stretch, our last physical hazard here, we have noise exposure.

697
01:10:30,580 --> 01:10:35,750
And so I'll just mention a few things about noise here.

698
01:10:35,770 --> 01:10:39,959
One is probably all of you have heard of noise expressed in terms of decibels.

699
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:47,260
So how many decibels this noise level that we all sort of emphasize here is just like when we talk about the intensity of earthquakes,

700
01:10:47,270 --> 01:10:56,169
they say like an 8.0 earthquake is much, much stronger than a 7.0 earthquake, even though the numbers appear quite similar, just like earthquakes.

701
01:10:56,170 --> 01:11:04,180
We're on a nonlinear scale here. We're a relatively small change in decibels is actually a huge change in the risk to the human body.

702
01:11:04,180 --> 01:11:13,569
From that sound, there are folks who think that noise is potentially the most common exposure to workers in the United States,

703
01:11:13,570 --> 01:11:18,160
and it's also among the most common exposures to all of us in the community.

704
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:26,589
You know, if you think about sources of noise in your community, I'm going to skip the poll everywhere just for for purposes of time here.

705
01:11:26,590 --> 01:11:27,909
And I'll I'll cut to the chase.

706
01:11:27,910 --> 01:11:34,080
So if I had told you moments ago, I can guarantee you the answers that would have come off would have been like what annoys me in my neighborhood,

707
01:11:34,090 --> 01:11:44,070
it's construction, it's traffic on the road, it's airplanes flying overhead, it's trains, it's my neighbors barking dogs.

708
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:52,420
All of these things are real nuisances, I will say, and I'm not sure this clip will work, but we have a relatively new source of sound.

709
01:11:55,510 --> 01:11:59,790
You can guess as to what this might come from.

710
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:14,830
That's a lot. So, you know, in our quest for green energy, we're installing wind turbines all over the place.

711
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:21,440
That's the sound of a wind turbine right up close to the tower. And so you can hear that kind of cyclic kind of clicking there.

712
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:26,630
That's every time you've got a tower. And every time a blade passes the tower, you get that clicking sound.

713
01:12:27,140 --> 01:12:30,530
So, you know, green energy is great, it's sustainable, it's good.

714
01:12:30,890 --> 01:12:35,000
But it's a type of noise exposure we've never had in the environment before.

715
01:12:35,750 --> 01:12:42,260
And in fact, the noise energy that wind turbines put out is primarily in frequencies that the human ear doesn't hear.

716
01:12:42,770 --> 01:12:47,580
So we're actually trying to figure out, can this be bad for us, even though we don't actually hear those things?

717
01:12:49,220 --> 01:12:53,990
In terms of health effects of noise here, I think it's probably a no brainer to say.

718
01:12:54,230 --> 01:12:58,549
Most of you probably understand that noise if you have too much can harm your hearing.

719
01:12:58,550 --> 01:13:06,920
That's absolutely correct. What you may not know is noise has been very convincingly linked to hypertension or high blood pressure to ischemia,

720
01:13:06,980 --> 01:13:11,299
heart disease, including heart attacks to sleep disturbance.

721
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:17,300
That might be a no brainer to certainly strongly linked to annoyance, you know,

722
01:13:17,300 --> 01:13:22,130
to performance degradation and maybe cognitive impacts and also psychological effects.

723
01:13:23,300 --> 01:13:30,140
Are the cardiac effects like direct or are they the result of like the stress of being exposed to noise?

724
01:13:30,170 --> 01:13:33,620
Yeah, that's a great question. So the answer is it may be both.

725
01:13:33,740 --> 01:13:40,370
So there's one mechanism might be that you're exposed to noise, you get a wave,

726
01:13:40,910 --> 01:13:50,120
and we know annoyance can actually lead to hormonal releases that can actually end up giving you hypertension or other impacts over time.

727
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:54,320
We know as well that noise absolutely disrupts your sleep.

728
01:13:54,350 --> 01:13:58,729
Even if you aren't waking up, your body is still responding and disrupted.

729
01:13:58,730 --> 01:14:03,200
Sleep is very strongly linked to cardiac effects like that.

730
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:11,240
Interestingly, there's also research that shows that workers who are in high noise also have these cardio effects.

731
01:14:11,330 --> 01:14:18,080
So workers are not sleeping on the job typically, and workers who are making a noise are not typically annoyed.

732
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:20,569
It's not like a community where you have no control over the noise.

733
01:14:20,570 --> 01:14:25,129
That sound of the noise is kind of the sound of them making them, and yet they're still at risk.

734
01:14:25,130 --> 01:14:28,280
So there may be some other pathways of play here. It's a great question.

735
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:34,870
So I'll mention, gosh, now, almost ten years ago,

736
01:14:34,870 --> 01:14:40,329
we did a survey of about 4500 people in New York City trying to figure out where were they getting

737
01:14:40,330 --> 01:14:46,220
most of their noise was coming from or was it coming from the music that they listened to?

738
01:14:46,270 --> 01:14:51,760
Or sort of non occupational activities like going to concerts or things like that.

739
01:14:52,180 --> 01:14:56,200
Was it coming from home or was it just from being out on the street in New York City?

740
01:14:56,860 --> 01:15:04,330
And so we looked, as we always need to, at where people were spending their time versus where they were actually getting their exposure.

741
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:11,710
Because if I'm trying to eliminate health impacts, I want to focus on what is it you're doing that's contributing the most to your exposure.

742
01:15:11,710 --> 01:15:15,850
I don't want to find something, something that you do that really isn't contributing much to your exposure,

743
01:15:15,850 --> 01:15:18,490
because if you change that, you're still getting too much noise.

744
01:15:19,150 --> 01:15:23,020
So we looked at where people were spending their time, and for the vast majority of folks,

745
01:15:23,020 --> 01:15:27,100
they were either at home or out shopping during kind of miscellaneous activities.

746
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:33,270
They were at work for about 16% of the time, spent about 1% of their time at concerts,

747
01:15:33,270 --> 01:15:37,599
some sort of loud recreation and listening to music for about 6% of the time.

748
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:41,340
So that's where they were, that's what they were doing, but where they were getting their dose from,

749
01:15:41,350 --> 01:15:46,090
this was pretty shocking to me as as an occupational health purpose or person.

750
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:55,060
So for these 4500 or so New Yorkers, the typical person was getting about 50% of their dose from the music that they listened to.

751
01:15:55,750 --> 01:16:01,180
So historically, if we were thinking about risk of hearing loss, it was in workers, people who had really noisy jobs.

752
01:16:01,180 --> 01:16:08,050
But this would suggest that many of us are getting most of our noise from this pleasurable activity of listening to music.

753
01:16:08,650 --> 01:16:12,730
You know, the workplace was contributing about 14% of noise on average.

754
01:16:13,390 --> 01:16:17,560
These are not occupational activities like going to concerts, things like that.

755
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:23,230
People were only spending 1% of their time on those, but they were getting about 16% of their dose from that.

756
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:30,069
And then interestingly, among these New Yorkers, we found that they were getting excuse me,

757
01:16:30,070 --> 01:16:36,550
getting about 14% of their dose just from riding the subway and the train and the bus.

758
01:16:37,030 --> 01:16:43,900
And in fact, we saw that about one out of ten New Yorkers were at risk of a hearing loss just from the noise they were getting using mass transit.

759
01:16:44,590 --> 01:16:48,219
So these are, you know, concerning numbers here.

760
01:16:48,220 --> 01:16:55,930
And in fact, the kind of takeaway I'll leave you with is when we looked at all of the sources combined for these 4500 New Yorkers,

761
01:16:55,930 --> 01:17:01,600
about nine out of ten New Yorkers were above the recommended limit for noise.

762
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:05,410
So nine out of ten people had a risk for noise induced hearing loss.

763
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:11,590
If you think about the other chemical or biological hazards, you'll talk about this in this class.

764
01:17:11,950 --> 01:17:17,709
You know, for the most part, we're going to be talking about know one in a million people might be overexposed or one in 100,000 here.

765
01:17:17,710 --> 01:17:23,320
We're talking about nine out of ten. And yet we do things about those chemicals and we don't typically do things about

766
01:17:23,320 --> 01:17:27,760
noise exposure because it's it's not recognized sort of an equivalent police.

767
01:17:28,870 --> 01:17:30,429
Now, we're just about out of time.

768
01:17:30,430 --> 01:17:37,450
So I'll just mention that there are limits for workplace noise that are enforced by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.

769
01:17:37,960 --> 01:17:42,070
There's also recommended limits designed to protect the community.

770
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:48,260
But all of these limits are only designed to protect your ears. There's not a limit out there that's designed to protect your heart yet.

771
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:52,240
So that's something we're kind of working towards. And then I'll just mention,

772
01:17:52,240 --> 01:18:00,160
because this is an ongoing I'm actually the principal investigator for the appeal hearing study I mentioned to start DHS orientation.

773
01:18:00,160 --> 01:18:04,330
So this is a study that's been going on for almost three years now where we're

774
01:18:04,330 --> 01:18:10,840
following about 150,000 people who are sharing data from their Apple Watch,

775
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:14,140
if they have one, on how noisy their environment is.

776
01:18:14,590 --> 01:18:20,590
And they're also choosing to share data from their phone that lets us know how loud and how long they're listening to music.

777
01:18:20,680 --> 01:18:27,550
So for the first time, we're going to have kind of a comprehensive picture of what Americans are exposed to on a daily basis.

778
01:18:27,640 --> 01:18:31,660
And these folks are taking different kinds of hearing tests over time as well.

779
01:18:31,660 --> 01:18:35,020
So we'll be able to tie these levels to actual health outcomes.

780
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:37,120
So this is super exciting.

781
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:43,390
If you want to read more about it, there's a link there and you're certainly welcome to participate in the study too if you want it to.

782
01:18:44,050 --> 01:18:47,530
So with that, I am out of time. I apologize for the dry content.

783
01:18:47,530 --> 01:18:54,120
There's just not much you can do with physical hazards to spice it up, but hopefully this has been somewhat educational for you all.

784
