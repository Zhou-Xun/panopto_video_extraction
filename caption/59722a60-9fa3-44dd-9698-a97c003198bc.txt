00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:05,281
Hey everyone, this is the quick review video for carbohydrates.

2
00:00:05,281 --> 00:00:10,171
The third lecture, and basically I'll be going over this very quickly.

3
00:00:10,171 --> 00:00:13,266
So carbohydrates are abbreviated CHO,

4
00:00:13,266 --> 00:00:17,275
because they have carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.

5
00:00:17,275 --> 00:00:22,348
To determine whether it's an aldehyde or a ketone the carbohydrates,

6
00:00:22,348 --> 00:00:27,670
you look at the whole chain and determine where the double bond is at the C and

7
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:30,481
oxygen if it's at the end of the chain.

8
00:00:30,481 --> 00:00:34,863
So at the extremities then it's an aldehyde, and if it's in the middle,

9
00:00:34,863 --> 00:00:36,075
then it's a keton.

10
00:00:36,075 --> 00:00:41,340
Monosaccharides are the simplest, polysaccharide are the most branch.

11
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:46,340
And they have glycosidic bonds to make them more branched basically.

12
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:51,106
So some monosaccharides, glucose, fructose and galactose, and

13
00:00:51,106 --> 00:00:57,440
this is their structure.

14
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,521
And then if it's an aldehyde, the name would end with ose.

15
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:08,581
And then if it's a ketone, the name of the carbohydrates would end with ulose.

16
00:01:08,581 --> 00:01:13,074
And then depending on how many carbons it has, it's either tri, die,tetre,

17
00:01:13,074 --> 00:01:20,940
hept, penta, and so on.

18
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:24,540
And so this is like the configuration and chirality.

19
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:29,997
And then glycosidic bonds are what keeps the monosaccharides bound together.

20
00:01:29,997 --> 00:01:33,921
Disaccharide we have major sources maltose, lactose and

21
00:01:33,921 --> 00:01:36,891
sucrose going through them individually.

22
00:01:36,891 --> 00:01:41,321
The maltose has to glucose units and they're bound together by an alpha 1,

23
00:01:41,321 --> 00:01:44,644
4 bond, which is easily detected by alpha-amylase and

24
00:01:44,644 --> 00:01:46,260
can be broken down nicely.

25
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:50,875
Lactose has galactose and glucose bound by beta 1, 4.

26
00:01:50,875 --> 00:01:59,340
Sucrose has an alpha 1, beta 2, glycosidic bond that connects glucose to fructose.

27
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,540
So we have different enzymes that work on those different lexical bonds.

28
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,776
As for polysaccharides, we will be talking about starch,

29
00:02:06,776 --> 00:02:09,190
we have two types amylose and amylopectin.

30
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:14,100
Amylose is very linear, it's unbranched, and it has an alpha 1,

31
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:18,950
4 bond, which is nicely and easily digested by alpha-amylase.

32
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:23,448
And then amylopectin is highly branched, it has an alpha 1, 4 bond for

33
00:02:23,448 --> 00:02:25,840
all the linear structures over here.

34
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,142
But then all of those branches, they form an Alpha 1,

35
00:02:30,142 --> 00:02:37,140
6 point, which is not detected by alpha-amylase.

36
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,813
So cellulose is, and the walls of the plants.

37
00:02:39,813 --> 00:02:43,911
It's a fiber that cannot be digested by our families because it has,

38
00:02:43,911 --> 00:02:47,587
they don't want four bonds that are not detected by amylase,

39
00:02:47,587 --> 00:02:51,360
which detects alpha 1, 4 bonds, but not beta 1, 4 bonds.

40
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,840
So this is why it's non digestible and goes through the digestive tract as is.

41
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,900
We'll be talking more about it, and the a fiber lecture.

42
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:03,784
Glycogen is the polysaccharide it's the major source of glucose, starch,

43
00:03:03,784 --> 00:03:05,971
and the human body and in mammals.

44
00:03:05,971 --> 00:03:10,960
And it's very highly branched, and it has alpha 1, 6 and alpha 1, 4 bonds.

45
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:17,240
So it's very similar to amylopectin, but it's even more branch than amylopectin.

46
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:22,111
This is just to a profile concept amylose is really unbranched, very simplistic.

47
00:03:22,111 --> 00:03:28,221
Amylopectin is more branched, but the most branched is glycogen.

48
00:03:28,221 --> 00:03:34,840
And now for a digestion and absorption.

49
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,592
So salivary amylase as mentioned,

50
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:42,281
begins in the mouth, and then it acts on alpha 1, 4 bonds.

51
00:03:42,281 --> 00:03:47,131
And the stomach, it's really unactivated by the acidity of the stomach.

52
00:03:47,131 --> 00:03:51,480
So the breakdown of carbohydrates and the stomach is almost negligible,

53
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,140
it's very minimal.

54
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:59,911
And the small intestine its resumed as one, basically the acidity goes down.

55
00:03:59,911 --> 00:04:05,920
And the pH becomes neutral which allows for alpha-amylase to be active.

56
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,464
And then there's also the release of the pancreatic alpha-amylase which helps them

57
00:04:10,464 --> 00:04:12,740
breaking down the bonds.

58
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:17,290
So when amylose is broken down, you get maltose and maltrotriose.

59
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:20,918
And then those need to be broken down further and to di- and

60
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:24,940
trisaccharides, and we'll be talking more about this.

61
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:33,580
Whereas amylopectin, it gets broken into isomaltose by the action amylase.

62
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:39,001
But then those glycosidic alpha 1, 6 bonds are still there.

63
00:04:39,001 --> 00:04:45,284
And then eventually it forms disaccharide with the alpha 1, 6 glycosidic bonds.

64
00:04:45,284 --> 00:04:51,237
So the enzymes that will do that work,

65
00:04:51,237 --> 00:04:57,761
[COUGH] sorry, so we'll talk about them.

66
00:04:57,761 --> 00:05:02,271
The isomaltase is specific to the alpha1, 6 bond of isomaltose.

67
00:05:02,271 --> 00:05:07,562
I'm gonna go back here, the alpha 1, 6 bond that's in amylopectin,

68
00:05:07,562 --> 00:05:13,640
and will remain an isomaltos needs to be further digested by isomaltase.

69
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:19,239
And then lactase is specific for lactose, sucrase specific for sucrose, and maltase

70
00:05:19,239 --> 00:05:24,081
specific for maltose, and maltriose, which is the product of a melo's.

71
00:05:24,081 --> 00:05:28,900
So when amylose is broken down, it healed maltose and maltrotriose,

72
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:34,340
and maltase will be the enzyme that breaks them down further.

73
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:37,896
Lactase non-persistence, it's not an allergy,

74
00:05:37,896 --> 00:05:42,826
is basically not producing sufficient plactase to break down lactose,

75
00:05:42,826 --> 00:05:47,060
which is usually in the orient mode, and this is very common.

76
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:52,193
The solution is to avoid dairy basically, this is a reminder

77
00:05:52,193 --> 00:05:57,742
of the brush border we've talked about in the previous lecture.

78
00:05:57,742 --> 00:06:03,741
And we've covered this, so now for transport, which is really interesting.

79
00:06:03,741 --> 00:06:10,585
So for glucose and galactose when you've consumed them in low concentrations,

80
00:06:10,585 --> 00:06:14,518
so they're not really highly concentrated.

81
00:06:14,518 --> 00:06:20,204
And the lumen they will be absorbed from the lumen

82
00:06:20,204 --> 00:06:27,977
through the brush border over here through the a pickle membrane.

83
00:06:27,977 --> 00:06:31,860
And then into the entire site and then out through the base lateral membrane.

84
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:36,240
So initially they will enter via SGLT1.

85
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,908
So this requires sodium as seen here, and then glucose,

86
00:06:40,908 --> 00:06:43,840
and galactose can go back in.

87
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,752
And so this is the first step, and

88
00:06:46,752 --> 00:06:51,329
then they exit the bloodstream by GLUT2 over here.

89
00:06:51,329 --> 00:06:55,051
And then there's an ATP pump over here that allows for

90
00:06:55,051 --> 00:07:03,440
sodium to go back to make sure that sodium does not accumulate inside the parasite.

91
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:15,740
So this is active over here, and then I believe that this is passive.

92
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:22,320
And so for fructose, it enters via GLUT5, and then it exits via GLUT2.

93
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:27,141
So far there is one common thing exiting via, GLUT2 is the same for

94
00:07:27,141 --> 00:07:31,273
both across the bass lateral membrane, but entering for

95
00:07:31,273 --> 00:07:35,870
glucose is through GLUT5, which does not require a carrier.

96
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:40,769
Whereas here you require the sodium to be present for

97
00:07:40,769 --> 00:07:47,040
SGLT1 activity to allow for glucose and galactose uptake.

98
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:50,551
And then when they're consumed very high concentrations, and

99
00:07:50,551 --> 00:07:53,040
they're really concentrated in the lumen.

100
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,179
Then all three of them, the glucose, galactose, and

101
00:07:56,179 --> 00:07:58,450
the fructose will enter via, GLUT2.

102
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:02,146
So think of GLUT2 as trying to assist SGLT1, and

103
00:08:02,146 --> 00:08:07,083
taking over kind of to allow for the uptake of all three nutrients.

104
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:10,658
And then the exit via GLUT2 which is what would

105
00:08:10,658 --> 00:08:18,040
happen normally under low concentrations.

106
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:22,576
So then they go through the capillaries, the portal vein, the liver, and

107
00:08:22,576 --> 00:08:25,940
then to the circulation.

108
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:30,586
This is a table if you're interested in other transporters and

109
00:08:30,586 --> 00:08:35,157
where they're located and what they transport, of course.

110
00:08:35,157 --> 00:08:40,288
[COUGH] So glycemic index is really telling you how much will a food

111
00:08:40,288 --> 00:08:45,250
that you're consuming really increase your blood glucose.

112
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:49,954
So if the food does not really increase your blood glucose by much,

113
00:08:49,954 --> 00:08:53,230
it's considered to have a low gycemic index.

114
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:56,721
What usually is associated with foods that have fiber.

115
00:08:56,721 --> 00:09:02,224
Because the fiber will just keep the sugar kind of allowing

116
00:09:02,224 --> 00:09:07,401
the sugar to be released slower into the circulation.

117
00:09:07,401 --> 00:09:12,245
So it doesn't really cause your blood glucose to spike if there's a lot

118
00:09:12,245 --> 00:09:13,617
of fiber and food and

119
00:09:13,617 --> 00:09:18,155
as you can notice all of those foods are really like high and fiber.

120
00:09:18,155 --> 00:09:22,780
It becomes a medium glycemic index when there is like less fiber and

121
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:27,180
the food or more glucose, and that's more readily absorbed.

122
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:32,623
And then it's high when the glucose is very readily absorbed,

123
00:09:32,623 --> 00:09:36,431
and it causes a spike and the blood glucose.

124
00:09:36,431 --> 00:09:39,512
So it goes into the circulation fairly quickly, and

125
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:44,840
causes a spike and blood glucose.

126
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:48,391
So homeostasis of blood glucose is really important.

127
00:09:48,391 --> 00:09:54,377
We do not want the blood glucose to be too low, that's what leads to hyperglycemia or

128
00:09:54,377 --> 00:09:58,370
too high because that's what leads to hyperglycemia.

129
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:04,423
So everything within normal glycemia would be good.

130
00:10:04,423 --> 00:10:10,545
Limitations of course, of the glycemic index it's limited to one food,

131
00:10:10,545 --> 00:10:15,284
so it doesn't really take into account eating a meal,

132
00:10:15,284 --> 00:10:18,940
it takes every piece of food by itself.

133
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:23,428
And people definitely respond differently, so

134
00:10:23,428 --> 00:10:28,908
someone can respond to cookies in a very tolerable manner.

135
00:10:28,908 --> 00:10:32,910
They can eat five cookies and not have a spike in their glycemic index.

136
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:37,070
Whereas someone else might eat half a cookie, and have this massive spike and

137
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,361
their glycemic index.

138
00:10:38,361 --> 00:10:43,083
And it all boils down to personal differences between human beings and

139
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:47,803
how well they respond to insulin, how well they secrete insulin, and

140
00:10:47,803 --> 00:10:51,840
definitely other metabolic factors.

141
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,176
And that was it.
