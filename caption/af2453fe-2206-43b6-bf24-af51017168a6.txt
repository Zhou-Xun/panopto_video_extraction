1
00:00:05,952 --> 00:00:12,762
community in our courses and in our community and beyond is always important.

2
00:00:13,332 --> 00:00:27,371
I think it became much more at the forefront of people's minds during the pandemic when we were fully remote and we weren't seeing that interaction.

3
00:00:27,372 --> 00:00:33,372
That just happens naturally when we're coming into the same space on a regular schedule.

4
00:00:34,362 --> 00:00:43,092
So while some of that is continuing to happen, there are courses that are still meeting online fully.

5
00:00:43,092 --> 00:00:47,112
And I think there's a lot of things that can apply whether we're meeting in-person or not.

6
00:00:47,952 --> 00:00:54,852
And a big part of this will focus on finding the right tool for the type of community

7
00:00:54,852 --> 00:01:00,372
or the type of things you as the instructor are looking to get out of discussion.

8
00:01:00,972 --> 00:01:12,942
Okay. So our agenda are to talk about considerations, things you might be thinking about when you are incorporating discussion.

9
00:01:14,382 --> 00:01:22,302
We're going to talk about different features of the different tools that are available to you and touch briefly on implementing these tools,

10
00:01:22,302 --> 00:01:23,082
what's involved.

11
00:01:23,322 --> 00:01:32,262
And of course, with any of these, our team is available for consultation or for helping with setup and implementation of this in your course.

12
00:01:32,712 --> 00:01:41,742
Wonderful. We'll start with just some of the considerations you're going to want to consider.

13
00:01:41,742 --> 00:01:46,632
You know, what type of community are you trying to build and will expand some of that out on the next slide?

14
00:01:48,852 --> 00:01:54,251
Do you want this to be graded interaction or is this ungraded interaction?

15
00:01:54,252 --> 00:01:57,972
Or maybe you want a mix of both. Sometimes you want to do graded, sometimes you don't.

16
00:01:59,922 --> 00:02:05,501
Do you want things to be instructor prompted or do you want to create an environment

17
00:02:05,502 --> 00:02:09,762
where students you want students to be initiating discussion with one another?

18
00:02:10,632 --> 00:02:15,461
What are your participation expectations for this interaction?

19
00:02:15,462 --> 00:02:19,992
Do you want students contributing multiple times per week?

20
00:02:20,832 --> 00:02:24,582
Once a week? Are there deadlines?

21
00:02:24,842 --> 00:02:29,292
You want them to do something before class time or after class time?

22
00:02:30,852 --> 00:02:34,301
And then are there any particular features that might be interested?

23
00:02:34,302 --> 00:02:40,452
And so these considerations excuse me, five class.

24
00:02:43,942 --> 00:02:50,872
These considerations are things that our team would be asking you if you were to come to us and say,

25
00:02:50,872 --> 00:02:56,032
I'm trying to do this thing, how I'm not quite sure how to go about it.

26
00:02:56,182 --> 00:02:58,612
So these are the kinds of questions that we would be asking.

27
00:03:01,142 --> 00:03:07,622
When we talk about the types of communities, we do want to forget about co-curricular communities.

28
00:03:09,512 --> 00:03:21,782
You know, we have a tool. One of our tools, Yellow Digg is has been used by a lot of poster session teams in epidemiology, global health and beyond.

29
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:28,712
And so that's been a very interesting use case because they're inviting mentor,

30
00:03:28,712 --> 00:03:35,252
internship mentors and things like that that are outside of our community.

31
00:03:36,962 --> 00:03:46,112
But could there be sort of an alumni networking where maybe Abbott alumni are interacting with current students?

32
00:03:47,162 --> 00:03:52,992
So there's different things. You know, could it be a career services?

33
00:03:54,372 --> 00:03:59,162
Community where students are seeking advice and recommendations.

34
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:06,492
And how did you do this? Are you looking to build a community of just human connections?

35
00:04:06,762 --> 00:04:11,172
Do you want a place where and this might overlap a little bit with co-curricular?

36
00:04:11,622 --> 00:04:16,242
Do you want to do some business but also connect with one another?

37
00:04:17,472 --> 00:04:25,512
Maybe through surveys and polls? Or inviting them to share something on a more personal level.

38
00:04:26,152 --> 00:04:32,142
Okay. And then we have tools that are more focused on sort of peer learning and support.

39
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:41,832
One tool, it's primary purpose, is to work as a Q&A forum where students can basically help each other,

40
00:04:42,492 --> 00:04:47,772
work through assignments and help each other get unstuck on certain things.

41
00:04:49,582 --> 00:04:55,312
And then, is this a community you want to build around your specific course content?

42
00:04:55,882 --> 00:05:07,282
We have some great opportunities to do that as well. So one of the things I just want to oh, I think it's so good.

43
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:13,012
So the tools I'm going to focus on are the ones shown here.

44
00:05:13,542 --> 00:05:21,912
I have the canvas canvas icon because we're in talk about canvas discussions and how they fit in all of these other fancier integrated tools.

45
00:05:21,912 --> 00:05:35,562
We have perusal. We're going to talk about Yellow Digg and Piazza and Slack and when one might be better or another, what kinds of use cases.

46
00:05:36,432 --> 00:05:45,342
And again, we're focusing on the discussion aspect and not so much tools for feedback or collaboration.

47
00:05:46,032 --> 00:05:53,772
I'm creating a distinct category here for that, although there's certainly overlap with some of these.

48
00:05:55,652 --> 00:06:03,602
Mm hmm. So let's see how we might pair the tools to these types of communities we want to build.

49
00:06:04,202 --> 00:06:11,762
So for co-curricular and just building human connections with one another, I think slack and yellow dig.

50
00:06:14,742 --> 00:06:23,502
Create an environment to do that the best, then some of these others for peer learning and support.

51
00:06:24,642 --> 00:06:29,892
You could set you could set up the canvas discussion environment.

52
00:06:31,212 --> 00:06:34,812
Piazza. This is the one that's the Q&A forum.

53
00:06:34,812 --> 00:06:39,672
It's basically designed for that peer support and then yellow Digg.

54
00:06:40,652 --> 00:06:42,812
As well could also be used for this.

55
00:06:44,772 --> 00:06:54,822
Lastly, if we're focusing more on course content and we want students talking about topics and practicing using the language of the field,

56
00:06:56,142 --> 00:07:01,142
I've I'll be showcasing sort of campus discussions, perusal.

57
00:07:01,162 --> 00:07:07,392
This is where I think perusal really shines and then yellow and I know I have yellow Digg attached to all of these.

58
00:07:07,962 --> 00:07:16,092
It's a very flexible tool. There are so many things you can turn on or off and use it and just a very highly customizable way.

59
00:07:20,222 --> 00:07:29,672
This is just a grid, a comparison of what each of these tools has and which ones maybe don't have.

60
00:07:29,672 --> 00:07:33,782
And for the most part, they're pretty.

61
00:07:34,782 --> 00:07:40,932
Similar. I didn't know that Slack had anonymous discussion features.

62
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:50,822
I didn't neither. I feel like that one's and one might want to follow up on.

63
00:07:51,212 --> 00:07:56,042
Yeah. Especially like when you are soliciting course feedback and stuff.

64
00:07:56,282 --> 00:08:02,072
I ended up using like ideas board because I wanted to make sure that they could say stuff anonymously.

65
00:08:02,402 --> 00:08:04,252
Right. Yeah.

66
00:08:06,022 --> 00:08:17,121
One other that I thought so this was this was compiled by it's and I've kind of borrowed from it another one that I'm also not sure about,

67
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:28,142
I felt like I needed to maybe dive in a little bit more is. In perusal the ability to see who's online.

68
00:08:28,162 --> 00:08:33,282
I'm sorry. Not not peruse our perusal definitely does that. Piazza see who is online?

69
00:08:33,292 --> 00:08:46,402
I didn't see that in any of my initial look at this tool, so I'm not fully sure I am kind of trusting that they've looked into that.

70
00:08:46,402 --> 00:08:52,292
But you're right. That anonymous discussions might be worth a follow up on.

71
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:59,802
Yeah. Tangible posts.

72
00:08:59,912 --> 00:09:03,362
That just means like when people write in Slack or whatever and they say,

73
00:09:03,422 --> 00:09:11,371
like at Elizabeth Love Berenberg and I draws my attention to I know that is out tag will means yeah this could be a little bit more

74
00:09:11,372 --> 00:09:20,522
flexible in using at tags like you just mentioned or maybe even hashtags as a way of organizing content and making it searchable.

75
00:09:21,002 --> 00:09:25,742
Mm hmm. I'm not sure which in particular, but.

76
00:09:27,042 --> 00:09:32,752
Both of those. Options are available in these tools.

77
00:09:34,062 --> 00:09:39,642
With the exception of the canvas discussion. So.

78
00:09:41,532 --> 00:09:50,412
Yeah. Some of the basic features to making sure you're getting the tool that's going to do what you want it to do.

79
00:09:51,192 --> 00:10:02,262
Mm hmm. So let's let's dive in and just kind of do a little bit more of a comparison.

80
00:10:02,292 --> 00:10:06,762
So here's just a look at the standard canvas discussions.

81
00:10:07,572 --> 00:10:12,132
It's right here in canvas. Want to get me spotlight?

82
00:10:14,232 --> 00:10:19,242
Creating a new discussion is very easy. Use the plus discussion you can set up.

83
00:10:19,512 --> 00:10:27,312
There's a quick option here to allow students to initiate discussion, edit discussion, attach items to discussions.

84
00:10:32,652 --> 00:10:40,092
Okay. So these are typically used as assignment based.

85
00:10:41,792 --> 00:10:45,522
They can be graded or ungraded and it's built in.

86
00:10:45,542 --> 00:10:50,552
There's no real additional steps or anything else you need to learn in order to use it.

87
00:10:52,772 --> 00:11:00,421
This is great for and often used as instructor initiated discussion around a specific

88
00:11:00,422 --> 00:11:07,382
topic and for the most part the grading side for instructors is pretty easy.

89
00:11:07,742 --> 00:11:12,092
Canvas compiles the posts when for graded instructions.

90
00:11:12,782 --> 00:11:21,722
Graded discussions can't. The speed grader will compile those posts for you so you can review them and score

91
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:28,592
them right through speed grader and sort of my my keep in mind caution site is.

92
00:11:30,192 --> 00:11:34,782
The campus discussion often lacks the student to student interaction piece.

93
00:11:36,072 --> 00:11:44,352
These are most typically used as all right you have from this time to this time to respond to the prompt I've set.

94
00:11:45,012 --> 00:11:53,292
And then now I'm going to force the student just interaction by saying you need to respond to other peers.

95
00:11:53,802 --> 00:11:59,472
And pretty much everybody across the board hates that type of discussion set up.

96
00:11:59,952 --> 00:12:06,462
Even when I've taken online classes, it's just very forced.

97
00:12:06,462 --> 00:12:10,632
It's not an actual discussion. People are engaged and enjoying and learning from.

98
00:12:11,202 --> 00:12:18,312
Exactly. And and one thing that I think a trap sometimes we fall into is the question

99
00:12:18,312 --> 00:12:23,532
that we're asking doesn't necessarily solicit a wide variety of responses.

100
00:12:23,832 --> 00:12:29,532
We've all basically answered the same thing, but now I have to go say something to a peer,

101
00:12:30,612 --> 00:12:35,802
and I'm kind of really stretching to figure out how to interact.

102
00:12:36,312 --> 00:12:45,582
You know, there's certainly a lot of room for growth of how we use discussions to open that up, but we tend to box ourselves in.

103
00:12:47,402 --> 00:12:51,962
Yeah. So let's talk about perusal.

104
00:12:51,992 --> 00:12:54,632
Here is a quick look of the interface.

105
00:12:56,222 --> 00:13:04,712
What I don't have here, there's a left hand navigation when you're in perusal that shows you sort of other assignments in the list.

106
00:13:05,762 --> 00:13:13,292
But this is an example of a perusal that has been a tete a perusal assignment that's been set up to a reading.

107
00:13:13,832 --> 00:13:17,702
So the PDF reading has been uploaded over here.

108
00:13:18,842 --> 00:13:22,292
As a student, I have different view options.

109
00:13:22,712 --> 00:13:28,892
I can make this full screen. I have a filter where if I just want to read.

110
00:13:31,482 --> 00:13:39,282
A clean version of the document. I can tell it to hide everybody's comments so that I don't get distracted.

111
00:13:41,052 --> 00:13:48,222
The instructor has allowed downloading of this document so I can download it and read it and then come back and participate.

112
00:13:49,602 --> 00:13:57,492
But but all of the highlights you see in this document are things that my peers have highlighted and left comments on.

113
00:13:58,362 --> 00:14:01,272
It's really cool and it looks like if I'm looking at the top,

114
00:14:01,512 --> 00:14:08,352
looks like you can download it like playing like how it originally was that you can also download it with people's comments, highlights, whatever.

115
00:14:08,382 --> 00:14:12,582
So that is exactly that you can download with annotation.

116
00:14:12,672 --> 00:14:16,032
That's right. I like that. It has both options.

117
00:14:16,512 --> 00:14:22,182
Yeah. And this was something on the newer side in the past couple of years.

118
00:14:24,762 --> 00:14:28,901
There is a this text annotation,

119
00:14:28,902 --> 00:14:39,522
meaning it'll allow me to highlight actual sentences and lines within this pdf or say I've uploaded an image

120
00:14:39,522 --> 00:14:46,212
and maybe this is a design class or an infographic and people are leaving comments on my infographic.

121
00:14:46,512 --> 00:14:53,682
They could use just a selection tool to select a region which would allow them to leave a comment on that selection.

122
00:14:55,332 --> 00:15:02,052
Yeah. So at a glance I can see what my peers have sort of highlighted and started on.

123
00:15:02,202 --> 00:15:06,822
And then I can read that discussion, those, that information and reply to it.

124
00:15:07,452 --> 00:15:11,712
I can upvote it. Oh, that's cool.

125
00:15:12,372 --> 00:15:16,422
Or I can say, oh yeah, I can sort of attach my yeah.

126
00:15:16,422 --> 00:15:24,672
I also have this question. Now I kind of want to use this for, like, all the readings.

127
00:15:25,452 --> 00:15:33,792
Yeah, that's really cool. We had some really good feedback this fall from students that were using this,

128
00:15:35,592 --> 00:15:39,791
particularly in the online program, just because we, you know, those classes are shorter.

129
00:15:39,792 --> 00:15:42,852
So we've had time to hear from those instructors.

130
00:15:43,152 --> 00:15:48,312
But one of our one of the first classes that students take when they join the online program,

131
00:15:49,332 --> 00:15:57,131
they actually mentioned at an advising session how much they liked interacting with their peers in perusal,

132
00:15:57,132 --> 00:16:04,332
specifically because they were only meeting once a week, you know, over Zoom, which is the standard structure of the class.

133
00:16:04,722 --> 00:16:08,382
But this was the way they seemed to.

134
00:16:09,452 --> 00:16:14,882
Enjoy and get some value out of interacting around the course content.

135
00:16:17,972 --> 00:16:21,182
So yeah, we've we've had a lot of positive.

136
00:16:25,202 --> 00:16:27,242
Feedback from this tool.

137
00:16:28,292 --> 00:16:42,302
So perusal is creating a social learning activity out of something that would typically be a singular individual task of reading an article,

138
00:16:43,652 --> 00:16:51,302
watching a video. These can be graded or ungraded if using graded.

139
00:16:52,352 --> 00:16:55,082
It has a highly customizable grading formula.

140
00:16:56,532 --> 00:17:07,752
With some really interesting sort of aspects of how students earn full credit for engaging or participating.

141
00:17:09,782 --> 00:17:19,562
Instructors get really good analytics. So when I showed that upvote button or that I also have that question in the background,

142
00:17:19,952 --> 00:17:27,992
the instructor is going to get a really nice summary of, Oh, here's some questions that students had about this reading.

143
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:36,362
It's going to compile those for you. It's going to allow you to it's going to sort of compile some of the most upvoted comments.

144
00:17:37,562 --> 00:17:43,652
And so when we look at what it's great for, it's great for encouraging preparation before students come to class.

145
00:17:44,402 --> 00:17:52,292
You're going to have a sense of if students actually read the content before we start talking about it in class or expanding on it.

146
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:58,382
And then it's also a great way to review those comments, review those questions,

147
00:17:58,562 --> 00:18:05,281
and then bring those to class and say it's a great way to sort of kickstart the

148
00:18:05,282 --> 00:18:11,822
discussion of here were some great ideas and questions that came out of the reading.

149
00:18:12,302 --> 00:18:23,012
Why don't we dive into those a little bit deeper? Keep in mind reasonable time and expectations for participation.

150
00:18:24,752 --> 00:18:29,132
I think I think it would absolutely be possible to do all your readings,

151
00:18:29,522 --> 00:18:36,332
but you might dial down how much they have to participate in order to get full credit just so that they're not.

152
00:18:36,362 --> 00:18:41,462
But can you have it so that they don't have to participate at all if they don't want to?

153
00:18:41,492 --> 00:18:46,472
But it's here. Other people that read it might want to put in some helpful comments or questions.

154
00:18:47,252 --> 00:18:50,252
Yeah. Just have the readings in that format.

155
00:18:50,762 --> 00:19:03,582
Absolutely. Yes. So it could be set up as an ungraded optional activity where students can engage if they would like.

156
00:19:04,502 --> 00:19:14,282
Yeah, because I mean, I feel like with third grade students, if they don't want to engage and they can hurt themselves, that's their choice, you know?

157
00:19:14,972 --> 00:19:22,562
That's right. And that you know, that's a really a one definite way to approach this is.

158
00:19:23,802 --> 00:19:31,932
Yeah. Take responsibility for your own learning. I'm creating these opportunities that you can take or decide to not take.

159
00:19:32,262 --> 00:19:38,592
Mhm. So this reasonable time and expectations primarily goes for graded.

160
00:19:39,282 --> 00:19:47,352
We don't want to wear them out and actually turn it from valuable interaction to busywork.

161
00:19:48,052 --> 00:19:50,802
Yeah, it's a barometer for sure.

162
00:19:52,242 --> 00:20:01,902
And then with perusal, we of course, with all discussion, we want to create open ended prompts of, you know, what, what they might look for.

163
00:20:02,052 --> 00:20:05,532
And this would be more for a graded if you're requiring them to interact.

164
00:20:05,982 --> 00:20:11,922
What kinds of things do you want them to be thinking about? What kinds of things do you want them to pull from the reading?

165
00:20:11,922 --> 00:20:19,961
That might be good discussion starters. And is this one where you can have prompts or you could not have prompts?

166
00:20:19,962 --> 00:20:23,352
You could have multiple prompts. You could have one prompt. That's right.

167
00:20:23,352 --> 00:20:28,892
Yes. Yes. One.

168
00:20:29,192 --> 00:20:35,732
A couple of things they didn't add to the slide are brutal offers, differentiated assignments so you could split up the class.

169
00:20:35,732 --> 00:20:39,002
They're looking at different articles. That's cool.

170
00:20:39,842 --> 00:20:44,042
And then maybe as a than they present, that's really cool.

171
00:20:45,782 --> 00:20:54,512
Or what? The differentiated assignment also sets it up for a double duty as a peer review students,

172
00:20:54,512 --> 00:21:00,661
it does allow for a student upload option or you can always have an assignment where students are

173
00:21:00,662 --> 00:21:07,502
uploading document and bring it over to perusal where students can leave feedback for one another.

174
00:21:08,042 --> 00:21:20,222
I mean, and yeah, and I think it's I think it work would work best as a peer review tool if it's already being used as a tool, normal reading tool.

175
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:30,032
So it's more familiar. Exactly. So it's something that if the students have been using, it's great to, you know, slide it in as a peer review tool.

176
00:21:30,392 --> 00:21:35,762
I may not introduce it solely for that purpose.

177
00:21:36,392 --> 00:21:42,602
That's good to know. And they've newly added the ability, they call it a quiz,

178
00:21:42,602 --> 00:21:49,921
but it's more of just a knowledge check or survey questions that you can attach to a reading.

179
00:21:49,922 --> 00:21:56,162
And I know I focus I focus on reading because I think we mostly see it as like PDF articles,

180
00:21:56,552 --> 00:22:01,442
but you can put websites, it'll pull a website over, oh wow.

181
00:22:02,282 --> 00:22:07,742
You can do video usually if it's YouTube or Vimeo work best.

182
00:22:08,132 --> 00:22:13,022
Mm hmm. And then up you can upload anything.

183
00:22:13,952 --> 00:22:17,162
That's neat. We just do. Oh, sorry.

184
00:22:17,162 --> 00:22:27,782
Go ahead. I was just gonna say, is this something that I could like when I'm reading journal articles used to annotate just my own stuff.

185
00:22:29,252 --> 00:22:36,412
Like not as a class assignment. Yeah, I think you would have to create a perusal course to do that.

186
00:22:36,422 --> 00:22:44,852
I don't know if you have like a sandbox site, but what's nice is once you're kind of in and it kind of remembers my log in.

187
00:22:44,852 --> 00:22:50,102
So every time I go to perusal dot com, I can see all the courses that I'm in.

188
00:22:50,282 --> 00:22:55,382
Got it. Okay. And jump to those. To me.

189
00:22:58,802 --> 00:23:03,652
Yeah. So that is perusal and yeah, a very excellent tool.

190
00:23:03,662 --> 00:23:10,532
It was sort of their slogan for developing it was every student prepared for class?

191
00:23:11,012 --> 00:23:21,092
Yeah. And it was sort of a if you don't know if your students are doing the class prep, this is one way that you might.

192
00:23:21,922 --> 00:23:26,072
Yeah. Set it up to where you can find out.

193
00:23:26,862 --> 00:23:34,172
Um, and then if, if you are using the graded option,

194
00:23:34,592 --> 00:23:44,451
it is also great for if you want to be a little bit more hands off in the grading because once you set up your grading formula perusal,

195
00:23:44,452 --> 00:23:52,472
it's going to do all the work. From there, it's integrated into canvas, so it's going to pass those grades right over to the canvas grade book,

196
00:23:52,772 --> 00:23:58,712
and then the instructor can always override anything.

197
00:24:03,572 --> 00:24:07,172
So the integration of how you might set this up in a canvas site.

198
00:24:07,172 --> 00:24:14,402
And so I focused on canvas, but this is also available in Coursera, but that's trickier and not covered right here.

199
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:19,472
So for me, if I wanted to incorporate it into Coursera, you could help me.

200
00:24:19,862 --> 00:24:24,512
Absolutely. Yes. So we have that set and we're actively using it in Coursera right now.

201
00:24:24,572 --> 00:24:28,072
Awesome. Ungraded.

202
00:24:28,252 --> 00:24:32,002
All you need to do in canvas is add it to that left hand course navigation.

203
00:24:32,782 --> 00:24:40,992
Which is. By going through the canvas settings, the navigation tab and basically dragging or moving,

204
00:24:41,742 --> 00:24:46,332
locating perusal in the list and moving it up to the active tools.

205
00:24:46,762 --> 00:24:51,371
Okay. There's a guided set up that'll just ask you about your course topic.

206
00:24:51,372 --> 00:24:57,522
When does the course end? And then you can upload any materials to the library.

207
00:24:58,272 --> 00:25:04,662
And the library is just a collection, of course, materials.

208
00:25:05,022 --> 00:25:09,702
This is, you know, when you're doing graded,

209
00:25:10,632 --> 00:25:20,592
you're going to use the canvas assignment and set it up as an external tool assignment for each of your perusal discussions.

210
00:25:21,432 --> 00:25:26,682
Okay. You're going to go through that same guided set up that's just going to ask you some basics about your course.

211
00:25:27,492 --> 00:25:31,391
You're going to go through the grading formula, and this is one thing that we would be happy to help with,

212
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:37,212
because it's a it's a very robust grading formula of how they're determining.

213
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:44,922
It's pretty interesting. So when you start drilling down into it and then you're going to upload your content to the library,

214
00:25:45,342 --> 00:25:52,332
but then also set it up as an assignment where you're setting a due date and that kind of thing.

215
00:25:52,932 --> 00:26:01,812
Okay. So yeah, you basically have choices of how involved you want students to be.

216
00:26:02,922 --> 00:26:11,022
So for for your case of like. Everyone, you know, feel free to as you're reading and going through course material share your thoughts,

217
00:26:11,322 --> 00:26:17,782
highlight anything you think's important or critical or that you'd want us to discuss in class.

218
00:26:18,462 --> 00:26:22,542
Yeah. And then this would be more structured and scored.

219
00:26:27,032 --> 00:26:36,722
Let's move on to Piazza. Piazza is another one of those tools that is buried deep within the the integrations we have available to us in canvas.

220
00:26:38,822 --> 00:26:43,382
Now, is this one just canvas? Yes.

221
00:26:43,632 --> 00:26:49,742
Okay. I'm sure we could get an integrated and Coursera.

222
00:26:49,762 --> 00:26:57,582
I just don't think we would. This is a look at the PSA interface.

223
00:26:57,592 --> 00:27:04,552
The left hand column here is basically a running list of posts by date.

224
00:27:05,532 --> 00:27:15,912
Look across the top, a little small are folders for assignments and projects and exams that students

225
00:27:15,912 --> 00:27:21,462
can categorize their questions based on questions that they've written.

226
00:27:21,912 --> 00:27:29,442
Yes. Okay. Yes. So this is this is the Q&A forum.

227
00:27:29,892 --> 00:27:34,752
It's set up to be very student driven.

228
00:27:35,382 --> 00:27:45,162
And here you'll see here this class at a glance, 18 unread posts, three unanswered questions that no one has responded to yet.

229
00:27:45,162 --> 00:27:49,452
So me as a peer could go in and see if I can help with any of these questions.

230
00:27:49,492 --> 00:27:53,112
So everybody seeing this, I see it when I log in, but so do my students.

231
00:27:53,442 --> 00:27:56,442
Exactly. Yeah. Yes.

232
00:27:56,442 --> 00:28:05,562
And so as an instructor, you're going to get more in-depth statistics on what students are contributing and how much.

233
00:28:07,722 --> 00:28:09,432
And then six unresolved follow ups.

234
00:28:10,152 --> 00:28:21,942
I don't know what that makes probably any sort of comment that no one commented on that could be or something that generated additional questions.

235
00:28:21,972 --> 00:28:28,382
Oh, yeah. Yeah. So over here in the left hand, we see that there's an unanswered question from last week.

236
00:28:28,392 --> 00:28:34,632
How do you print in Python? And when I click on that, I can read the post.

237
00:28:36,972 --> 00:28:44,232
And I can respond. I can see those two views.

238
00:28:45,702 --> 00:28:57,232
Okay. This tool used to be very unique in the way that it offered pull questions.

239
00:28:58,702 --> 00:29:05,812
It does offer pull questions, but it used to be one of the only things we had that offered pull questions,

240
00:29:06,382 --> 00:29:11,252
which primarily became a question and issue.

241
00:29:11,272 --> 00:29:15,832
When we initially moved to canvas from the See Tools platform.

242
00:29:16,162 --> 00:29:20,842
See tools offered pulling built in. Okay, folding.

243
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:26,032
And that was something that we lost when we moved to canvas.

244
00:29:28,512 --> 00:29:35,052
So Piazza is a Q&A. Students can post questions and respond to others questions.

245
00:29:35,062 --> 00:29:40,842
They can just post a note that doesn't really need a response, and they can post poll questions.

246
00:29:41,532 --> 00:29:44,202
There's also an interesting feature of live Q&A.

247
00:29:44,202 --> 00:29:53,562
The instructor can enable live Q&A during class, where students can post their questions as classes going on.

248
00:29:54,162 --> 00:29:58,602
Mm hmm. This is an ungraded tool.

249
00:30:00,822 --> 00:30:10,602
It's great for peer to peer support. And as we saw in that example, it looked I tend to see it in more coding environments.

250
00:30:11,172 --> 00:30:15,292
Students maybe have a ton of questions and are all helping each other through.

251
00:30:17,682 --> 00:30:24,612
And then, you know, if you like, the ability to organize questions into those assignment folders as a categorization option.

252
00:30:25,752 --> 00:30:34,212
Yeah. My big issue is it has a dated and cluttered interface, in my opinion.

253
00:30:34,632 --> 00:30:43,242
Mm hmm. Not everyone would agree with me. It's actually one of the it's actually used quite a bit at School of Public Health,

254
00:30:43,692 --> 00:30:51,432
and that is just based on survey responses from students when they've told us, hey, you know what tools that their instructors are using.

255
00:30:51,762 --> 00:30:58,242
Yeah. So, yeah, there are certainly use cases where this fits.

256
00:31:00,572 --> 00:31:05,252
Yeah. I could see it for those programing questions where you like one of them see people's answers

257
00:31:05,252 --> 00:31:09,422
into those different folders because you might look it up again or whatever are your questions.

258
00:31:09,422 --> 00:31:14,882
Exactly. There's definitely some strengths there for that.

259
00:31:16,232 --> 00:31:19,352
And then as an instructor, you can let students help each other.

260
00:31:19,532 --> 00:31:27,312
But you can also chime in and sort of. You know, tag a student's post as the correct answer.

261
00:31:28,062 --> 00:31:31,542
Listen to this person. This one's the correct one. Yeah, yeah.

262
00:31:35,272 --> 00:31:44,302
So that piazza integration this is going to be you can add it right to your canvas course navigation left hand menu again from the settings menu.

263
00:31:44,422 --> 00:31:53,241
And then there's a guided set up where it explains how it works and walks you through setting up any folders you need and that kind of thing.

264
00:31:53,242 --> 00:31:58,642
And IT students are added in as they click on that left hand menu option.

265
00:31:59,612 --> 00:32:03,522
Okay. Slack.

266
00:32:04,362 --> 00:32:10,002
So you probably have a good idea of pros and cons of Slack with using your online program.

267
00:32:11,352 --> 00:32:20,082
This is a screenshot of the Maize and Blue, which is the whole University of Michigan network workspace.

268
00:32:20,742 --> 00:32:30,162
Okay. And so all of these icons on the far left are different workspaces that I'm a part of, and within that are different channels.

269
00:32:30,342 --> 00:32:35,212
Okay, let me pull at mine so I can look at it with you. Okay.

270
00:32:38,552 --> 00:32:46,562
Yes. So in each of these workspaces, there's going to be channels that are going to be organized by topic.

271
00:32:46,772 --> 00:32:56,662
Title. Group name. And then I'm also going to I may have a set of individuals that I've been.

272
00:32:57,642 --> 00:33:02,652
Private chatting with. Yes. I have a list like that.

273
00:33:03,102 --> 00:33:15,882
Yes. And so the little pictures on the left are like the main group.

274
00:33:16,872 --> 00:33:23,652
Do you mean this far left? Yeah, those are different workspaces.

275
00:33:24,582 --> 00:33:30,732
Okay. And each of those workspaces may have a different set of members that are part of that.

276
00:33:30,852 --> 00:33:34,061
You've got one at I.T. That's probably all your i.t group.

277
00:33:34,062 --> 00:33:37,182
So you can connect with each other like. Okay, exactly.

278
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:44,742
So let's michigan i.t. I don't remember why I was invited to that, but basically i can connect with anyone in the u of m i.t network through that.

279
00:33:48,362 --> 00:33:51,392
So I have population, health and sciences, maize and blue.

280
00:33:51,812 --> 00:33:55,412
That's right. You miss work? What's you miss?

281
00:33:55,412 --> 00:34:01,532
Work? Yep. So that. So Maize and blue is a network of everyone.

282
00:34:02,192 --> 00:34:05,342
Faculty, students, staff in U of M.

283
00:34:05,852 --> 00:34:10,861
Mm hmm. In fact, on this welcome, you can see that there's 13,660.

284
00:34:10,862 --> 00:34:14,342
So members. I never looked at that.

285
00:34:17,672 --> 00:34:21,502
You mesh. Works is just U of m staff.

286
00:34:23,362 --> 00:34:31,512
Okay. And that's basically just for building community, getting conversations going amongst.

287
00:34:32,732 --> 00:34:35,902
Colleagues across campus. Okay.

288
00:34:37,962 --> 00:34:43,952
Well, my notes says that this space is just for you to jot down notes, list your to dos, or keep files handy.

289
00:34:43,962 --> 00:34:48,342
You can talk to yourself here. So you might be in the direct messages.

290
00:34:48,342 --> 00:34:51,731
You might be on your own name. Yep, you're right. I see.

291
00:34:51,732 --> 00:34:59,262
Yeah. Okay. And I sometimes I do actually use that to, like, just hold a couple of things.

292
00:35:00,222 --> 00:35:08,202
Yeah, I thought maybe every now and again where that is, leave myself some notes or some links that I want to share later.

293
00:35:08,592 --> 00:35:12,342
Yeah, cause I have that all the time, and I just have like a million kind of like Google Docs.

294
00:35:12,422 --> 00:35:23,112
So yeah, stored random stuff in population health that has all of our students and faculty in the online program.

295
00:35:23,982 --> 00:35:27,252
And so that membership is a restricted membership.

296
00:35:27,942 --> 00:35:35,172
And then in my example, in my top one that says U of M my top workspace, it's the instructional services media team.

297
00:35:36,042 --> 00:35:39,252
Okay? So this is how we communicate on all of our projects.

298
00:35:39,882 --> 00:35:44,472
And so you have these on the left there, the pictures, those are the workspaces.

299
00:35:44,472 --> 00:35:49,092
And then each space has whatever channels in it.

300
00:35:49,482 --> 00:35:57,461
Exactly. Okay. And so in the maize and blue and the U.

301
00:35:57,462 --> 00:36:01,872
Mesh works. You can create your own channels.

302
00:36:03,392 --> 00:36:13,182
Hmm. So this is one way you can build a slack community, whether it's co-curricular or a course.

303
00:36:15,462 --> 00:36:17,592
So let's look at some of the features here.

304
00:36:19,152 --> 00:36:29,262
So Slack is the any time instant messaging tool discussion can happen all the time, whenever, wherever you can create a slack channel.

305
00:36:30,652 --> 00:36:39,111
Or a slack workspace. And so a channel would be almost like one discussion thread where everything's

306
00:36:39,112 --> 00:36:44,782
going to go that like if I do like so the workspace is the population health,

307
00:36:44,782 --> 00:36:51,232
whatever that and then the Slack channel. I have one like for episode 602 for those are the.

308
00:36:51,352 --> 00:36:58,492
Okay, that's a channel. That's right. And so anything that comes up with your course is all in that one single channel.

309
00:36:58,702 --> 00:37:08,692
Yeah. Okay. Or you can create, there's an opportunity to have a slack workspace where maybe I want to break things up by different topic or project,

310
00:37:09,652 --> 00:37:13,012
which is what, what we have with our internal team.

311
00:37:13,342 --> 00:37:18,532
We have a channel for each course because.

312
00:37:19,682 --> 00:37:27,362
Different people may be working on different aspects of that course so that it helps you figure out what someone's your colleague is talking about.

313
00:37:27,902 --> 00:37:31,621
Exactly. That courses channel a question. Exactly.

314
00:37:31,622 --> 00:37:38,402
So this could be one other way where you're creating a workspace for your course and then a channel for each homework assignment.

315
00:37:39,492 --> 00:37:42,972
Okay. That's cool. So how do you do that?

316
00:37:43,242 --> 00:37:46,452
The workspace thing? Yes. We're getting to that.

317
00:37:46,602 --> 00:37:50,592
So this is great for conversation questions that peer to peer support.

318
00:37:51,162 --> 00:37:54,912
Keep in mind, this is maybe a new workflow for a lot of people,

319
00:37:56,322 --> 00:38:01,332
either by installing the app and remembering to open it so you get those notifications

320
00:38:01,662 --> 00:38:05,662
or having it open in a browser so that you're aware of that conversation.

321
00:38:05,662 --> 00:38:10,182
That's happening because it's an instant messaging tool.

322
00:38:10,212 --> 00:38:17,502
There may need to be some boundary settings you can post whenever you want, but I may not respond whenever.

323
00:38:17,862 --> 00:38:25,632
Yeah. You know, we talk about this a lot in the online program of feel free to interact with one another.

324
00:38:25,872 --> 00:38:28,962
Here's when I'm online and interacting.

325
00:38:29,382 --> 00:38:35,861
Okay. And then thinking about how you might organize discussions.

326
00:38:35,862 --> 00:38:41,202
Do you if thinking ahead, are you going to want discussions organized?

327
00:38:43,062 --> 00:38:50,122
Are you going to want to create be able to splinter off channels into different topics and discussion areas?

328
00:38:50,142 --> 00:38:59,682
Or is just a single channel going to be good enough because that's going to influence which setup you do channel versus workspace?

329
00:39:00,522 --> 00:39:14,082
Okay. A couple of things that so I think about Slack as like a group text without sharing phone numbers right.

330
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:22,602
And having one continuous ongoing you can now within the maize and blue.

331
00:39:22,602 --> 00:39:32,572
I'm not sure if this is available in the population health workspace, but I know in the Michigan workspace you can now launch what's called a huddle.

332
00:39:33,192 --> 00:39:37,722
So say I saw that option. I didn't know was there's a back and forth.

333
00:39:37,722 --> 00:39:42,762
You basically go into a quick online meeting launched right out of slack.

334
00:39:43,992 --> 00:39:49,602
Like with video or just a little group chat either way.

335
00:39:50,322 --> 00:39:55,302
Nope. Sorry. Either audio or video and audio.

336
00:39:55,572 --> 00:40:01,192
Okay. So it's a way to like, hey, I'm actually online.

337
00:40:01,212 --> 00:40:04,272
Do you guys want to jump in a huddle? Yeah. Let's see if we can work this out.

338
00:40:04,482 --> 00:40:09,822
Exactly. That's cool. Maybe a students jump on a huddle and work on a problem together.

339
00:40:10,392 --> 00:40:13,932
Okay. Yeah. I wasn't sure what that was, so I was afraid to like.

340
00:40:14,982 --> 00:40:23,562
Yeah, exactly. I have mostly experienced it when people have, like, invited me to join a huddle or a call.

341
00:40:24,102 --> 00:40:27,192
I have not yet initiated that on my own. Okay.

342
00:40:28,632 --> 00:40:32,291
And then one thing to keep in mind about Slack is it's not going to be able to

343
00:40:32,292 --> 00:40:38,862
give you any analytics if you're using this as a participation type of excuse.

344
00:40:39,072 --> 00:40:43,032
Like if I wanted to know how often this student has. Okay. That's right.

345
00:40:43,332 --> 00:40:52,782
Okay. So, again, just kind of thinking ahead about what your purposes are for creating a discussion environment, what you want students to do.

346
00:40:55,202 --> 00:40:58,472
Thinking about those things ahead of time. We're going to help you pick the right tool.

347
00:40:58,992 --> 00:41:03,721
Mm hmm. And then for Slack integration.

348
00:41:03,722 --> 00:41:07,892
So the how to do it for creating a channel, you could do it right now.

349
00:41:07,892 --> 00:41:11,272
You're already a part of the maze and blue workspace. Okay.

350
00:41:12,932 --> 00:41:16,322
When you hover over the word channel.

351
00:41:16,892 --> 00:41:23,252
Yeah. There is a plus sign that appears to create a new channel.

352
00:41:25,172 --> 00:41:28,672
Okay. Create a channel.

353
00:41:34,582 --> 00:41:39,602
Yeah. So that. It would be like right here.

354
00:41:39,872 --> 00:41:49,142
So if I made a channel in the maze in Blue Workspace, can everybody in Maze in blue automatically see it?

355
00:41:49,412 --> 00:41:54,362
I have to invite people. You would need to invite people.

356
00:41:54,452 --> 00:41:57,842
Mm hmm. You get to set whether it's public or private.

357
00:41:58,082 --> 00:42:03,602
And then you would invite users to that channel.

358
00:42:04,582 --> 00:42:16,512
Okay. And you would be the owner of that channel so you can remove and add users for creating your own workspace.

359
00:42:17,082 --> 00:42:21,342
There's a few different setup options. I'm going to click on this so we can take a look.

360
00:42:21,762 --> 00:42:25,842
Okay. I'm going to scroll down to what I feel like is most pertinent piece.

361
00:42:26,442 --> 00:42:32,682
And that is there's option one is a mic and community group workspace.

362
00:42:32,982 --> 00:42:45,852
Yeah, but the can Ann Arbor canvas course workspace option is how you could do one that will automatically shuttle all of your students over into it.

363
00:42:46,842 --> 00:42:51,122
Okay. Taking away one of those little user management pieces.

364
00:42:52,772 --> 00:43:02,192
So I'll provide this link in the follow up. Because basically when I create a canvas course workspace, it checks what courses I'm a teacher for.

365
00:43:02,522 --> 00:43:08,942
Yeah. And then lets you initiate that setup process and grab your students.

366
00:43:09,152 --> 00:43:14,832
So that's how you were able to like quickly make the channels for each of my classes.

367
00:43:15,542 --> 00:43:26,281
Like 602 580. Like that? No, because we because we don't use canvas for an online program.

368
00:43:26,282 --> 00:43:34,322
This is canvas. Okay. Secondly, the population health workspace is not on the U of M network.

369
00:43:35,222 --> 00:43:43,952
Okay. Because your VM only just like last year, got slack as an enterprise tool.

370
00:43:44,282 --> 00:43:49,952
Oh, wow. So and the program has been using it for years.

371
00:43:50,672 --> 00:43:54,332
Wow. Cool. So we use it separately.

372
00:43:57,672 --> 00:44:02,291
I'm not sure if there will ever be that transition or how that will be managed.

373
00:44:02,292 --> 00:44:07,472
But, you know, if we. Yeah.

374
00:44:07,772 --> 00:44:17,952
You know, maybe in the future if we move over to the. Michigan license, that team could utilize some of these more automated options.

375
00:44:19,282 --> 00:44:29,812
And then this is the start from scratch manual option where you can create one and add and manage all of your users manually.

376
00:44:31,522 --> 00:44:38,241
So manually create create based on course users or an EDM community group are the

377
00:44:38,242 --> 00:44:46,732
ways that they have set up processes for anyone to create their own group workspace.

378
00:44:47,452 --> 00:44:58,462
Okay. But when you do the add individually, I could add someone from that department, someone from that some someone from team you like.

379
00:44:58,462 --> 00:45:01,792
I could individually add whoever.

380
00:45:04,332 --> 00:45:18,952
Yep. That's right. And the last tool we're going to talk about is Yellow Digg.

381
00:45:20,452 --> 00:45:26,572
This is a screenshot from a yellow Digg environment. This is the sort of discussion feed.

382
00:45:27,412 --> 00:45:32,752
Mm hmm. And as part of this, they have added a poll question into their post.

383
00:45:34,202 --> 00:45:37,712
Okay. So they posted in yellow digg.

384
00:45:38,762 --> 00:45:44,672
And like Yellow Dog would be like a program that the students would have to open, like Slack or whatever.

385
00:45:46,562 --> 00:45:55,202
This can be integrated into Canvas or Coursera so that it's a jump over.

386
00:45:55,532 --> 00:46:02,022
And this would be browser based. But yes, this would be outside of chool.

387
00:46:02,022 --> 00:46:06,252
So this student here would have clicked the create button.

388
00:46:09,632 --> 00:46:14,572
Attached what topic their post is going to connect best to.

389
00:46:14,582 --> 00:46:18,272
Networking is what they went with.

390
00:46:18,272 --> 00:46:24,151
They titled their post. They typed typed out what they wanted to share,

391
00:46:24,152 --> 00:46:31,111
added a link hyperlink out to additional information and Yellow Pic allows

392
00:46:31,112 --> 00:46:38,252
you to build a poll for anyone else to answer that's in the yellow community.

393
00:46:38,982 --> 00:46:45,812
Okay, so yellow Digg looks and feels like a social media platform.

394
00:46:46,382 --> 00:46:51,422
Mm hmm. It it looks like a Twitter. It looks like a Facebook kind of layout.

395
00:46:51,422 --> 00:47:00,302
It's going to be a scrolling feed. Okay. And you can organize posts using these topic tags.

396
00:47:01,232 --> 00:47:05,611
Students can use hashtags which will also kind of yellow.

397
00:47:05,612 --> 00:47:08,852
Digg will organize off here to the side like these.

398
00:47:09,392 --> 00:47:15,961
Like had he written like hashtag networking recently it done that in there there would

399
00:47:15,962 --> 00:47:23,642
be a callout box over here where students and the instructor can filter by hashtags.

400
00:47:26,682 --> 00:47:33,582
Over here. It's a little small, but a student has responded with a clapping emoji icon.

401
00:47:33,912 --> 00:47:39,372
Mm hmm. And a couple of students have replied with text comments.

402
00:47:39,852 --> 00:47:43,241
So, yeah, very Facebook looking. Very Facebook looking.

403
00:47:43,242 --> 00:47:55,692
Yeah. Right over here on the right, this has been set up as a graded exercise and yellow dog is set up with a point based system.

404
00:47:56,442 --> 00:48:10,092
Okay. So it's not a matter of all right, week one discussion post this and respond to two people since hey here's a point goal.

405
00:48:11,492 --> 00:48:14,732
For the semester. Whatever you'd like. Okay.

406
00:48:14,762 --> 00:48:18,962
Right. And the point goal can be not turned on at all.

407
00:48:19,202 --> 00:48:23,792
It could be completely open ended and optional.

408
00:48:24,602 --> 00:48:28,352
It can be a weekly point goal. Okay.

409
00:48:28,352 --> 00:48:37,592
So there are expectations that you want students in there every week doing something they can you can set a weekly point goal.

410
00:48:37,982 --> 00:48:42,602
And then in this case, this is a semester long point goal.

411
00:48:42,992 --> 00:48:53,522
Okay, that's cool. Yeah. And so you can also set, you know, how much do they earn for initiating a post and commenting a post?

412
00:48:53,882 --> 00:48:59,192
Those are standard. But yellow Digg incorporates what they call social points.

413
00:48:59,642 --> 00:49:09,422
Mm hmm. So this poster, Damian, is getting awarded points for creating a post.

414
00:49:11,262 --> 00:49:19,361
And these two students here that left comments, they're getting points because they posted a comment dissipated.

415
00:49:19,362 --> 00:49:26,862
Yeah, right. But notice a student left an emoji icon here on Damian's post.

416
00:49:28,092 --> 00:49:37,992
This student. So Damian is going to win be awarded some social points for posting something that got a reaction from a student.

417
00:49:38,292 --> 00:49:43,002
So if you're just posting a post that like no one's going to engage and it's not interesting.

418
00:49:43,002 --> 00:49:46,512
Exactly. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, that's cool.

419
00:49:47,292 --> 00:49:52,162
Damian also is going to earn points for these two comments.

420
00:49:52,182 --> 00:50:01,902
Social points, these two comments. So not as much as he might get for commenting or posting, but it's totally up to you.

421
00:50:02,052 --> 00:50:09,012
But he earns points for posting something that against other students to interact with him.

422
00:50:09,402 --> 00:50:12,492
That's cool. And that's really the drive.

423
00:50:13,272 --> 00:50:22,092
Okay. Over here is a collection of what are called accolades.

424
00:50:22,272 --> 00:50:28,302
And this is the main way Yellow Dog wants instructors to participate.

425
00:50:29,352 --> 00:50:33,312
Instructors get to create the topic tags. Mm hmm.

426
00:50:33,972 --> 00:50:37,512
And instructors get to award what are called accolades.

427
00:50:38,442 --> 00:50:48,972
So when you see an exceptional post or exemplary project or someone sharing an article with really interesting data.

428
00:50:49,422 --> 00:50:54,942
Mm hmm. You can respond with an accolade, and you have the option to set.

429
00:50:55,032 --> 00:50:59,742
Attach a point value to those accolades. Hey, you taught me something new.

430
00:50:59,772 --> 00:51:05,832
Plus 50 points. Mm hmm. Things like that.

431
00:51:07,392 --> 00:51:12,882
So again, it has that social media look and features.

432
00:51:13,272 --> 00:51:20,832
It can be graded. Our ungraded graded is always going to be a point based either weekly or for the semester.

433
00:51:21,792 --> 00:51:24,852
And those instructor driven topics and accolades.

434
00:51:27,302 --> 00:51:31,322
It's a great for allowing participants to steer the discussion.

435
00:51:31,712 --> 00:51:40,861
They really built it to remove the everyone's just responding to the instructor that we kind of

436
00:51:40,862 --> 00:51:47,972
fall into with discussions and really getting students to initiate and engage around content.

437
00:51:48,692 --> 00:51:55,352
Go find an article that talks about what we discussed this week in class.

438
00:51:57,222 --> 00:52:08,172
And and share it on Yellow Dog. Yellow Dog is great for course and co-curricular use because it allows us to invite external users.

439
00:52:08,212 --> 00:52:11,472
You don't have to have a U of M account to use this tool.

440
00:52:12,582 --> 00:52:19,002
So as we talked about, like the poster session usage, that's become a very popular use case use of it.

441
00:52:21,132 --> 00:52:33,012
Keep in mind that you're going to want open ended prompts that could have a variety of responses and opinions and be a discussion starter.

442
00:52:34,752 --> 00:52:37,241
If you're using Yellow Dog in a graded way,

443
00:52:37,242 --> 00:52:46,512
you got to plan your participation expectations in advance because you want to formulate the point system to something that's achievable.

444
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:59,022
Mm hmm. I have worked with some instructors where it's like, Oh, gosh, the students are having a really hard time meeting the point goal.

445
00:52:59,262 --> 00:53:03,332
And they're asking, what? Can we change something?

446
00:53:03,452 --> 00:53:13,142
And so there have been classes where we have re read set the point value or the point go lower to the point goal maybe because again,

447
00:53:13,142 --> 00:53:22,362
it's that fine line of encouraging, fostering engagement and creating busywork that's stressing the students out.

448
00:53:22,682 --> 00:53:32,372
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. One unique thing about Yellow Dog is that everything students doing Yellow Dog is going to be a single grade in the grade book.

449
00:53:33,112 --> 00:53:42,032
Okay, it's a compilation, so you're not going to be able to score students individually on did everybody do the week one discussion?

450
00:53:42,032 --> 00:53:45,092
Yes or no? Okay. Okay.

451
00:53:45,122 --> 00:53:49,102
Grade for that. Grade for week two discussion. It's not set up for that.

452
00:53:49,112 --> 00:53:53,822
It's really created for an overarching participation.

453
00:53:54,062 --> 00:53:57,162
Engagement, one grade experience. That's right.

454
00:53:57,162 --> 00:54:03,901
Yeah. Okay, that's cool. So when you're implementing Yellow Dog in the Canvas and again, this tool,

455
00:54:03,902 --> 00:54:17,672
we also integrate into Coursera and we often use it in for any courses that are using the Coursera discussion board.

456
00:54:18,932 --> 00:54:26,222
We tend to convert it to Yellow Dig unless the instructor wants to do something more like perusal and redirect it.

457
00:54:26,732 --> 00:54:36,932
If the discussion is more about course content, we may flip it to perusal where we're attaching it to a reading or a video or something.

458
00:54:38,632 --> 00:54:42,202
Care for yellow dog integration for ungraded.

459
00:54:43,132 --> 00:54:46,462
We're going to add it to the course navigation and go through the guided setup.

460
00:54:47,602 --> 00:54:51,562
And part of that guided set up is to say no participation points.

461
00:54:52,072 --> 00:55:01,252
Okay. For the graded, we're going to go through that assignment external tool again and select Yellow Dog for the tool.

462
00:55:01,522 --> 00:55:05,872
We're going to go through the guided set up and where we create our point goals

463
00:55:07,402 --> 00:55:11,752
and our topic tags and you can even set up your accolades at that point.

464
00:55:12,022 --> 00:55:24,852
But but you can also do that any time. And of course, we're here for questions, assistance, implementation, training, whatever you need.

465
00:55:27,812 --> 00:55:38,912
Just advertising our recent workshops, which you have so faithfully attended, and these are all posted on our resilient teaching site in canvas.

466
00:55:39,242 --> 00:55:43,231
Wonderful. Thank you so much, Joanna.

467
00:55:43,232 --> 00:55:49,022
This is really helpful. I'm so glad. Hopefully it'll give you a lot of options and ideas.

468
00:55:49,472 --> 00:55:52,801
Yeah. And then. Yeah, our team has happy hour.

469
00:55:52,802 --> 00:55:58,441
Instructional designers be happy to talk through what might be the best fit for what types of scenarios.

470
00:55:58,442 --> 00:56:03,992
So yeah, I'm excited thinking about the courses that I'm teaching and how I could implement some of these tools.

471
00:56:03,992 --> 00:56:07,532
So that's cool. Fantastic. All right. Great to see you again.

472
00:56:07,592 --> 00:56:11,071
Good seeing you. Thank you so much. Yeah. Have a great weekend. You too.

473
00:56:11,072 --> 00:56:11,432
Bye.
