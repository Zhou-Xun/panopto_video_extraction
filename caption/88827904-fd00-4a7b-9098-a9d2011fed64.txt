1
00:00:05,766 --> 00:00:12,098
In addition to the one pager, testimony
can be a very effective vehicle for

2
00:00:12,098 --> 00:00:18,570
airing your view, advancing your
goal as part of the hearing.

3
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:21,980
To explain that a little more clearly,

4
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:27,140
hearings are held by decision making
bodies, many decision making bodies,

5
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:34,920
as a way of inviting all perspectives to
weigh in on the issue or problem at hand.

6
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,030
These hearings can take place
at the city council level,

7
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:44,450
at the state legislative level,
or in the United States Congress.

8
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:49,840
They're also frequently part
of the regulatory process.

9
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:55,310
So it's a common tool for
the decision maker to invite

10
00:00:55,310 --> 00:01:01,260
views and opinions as part of
the decision making process.

11
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:07,100
There are two ways to present testimony,
the first is written.

12
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:12,280
This is a terrific way of including facts,

13
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:18,060
expertise, data,
the evidence behind a view,

14
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:22,440
because all of that
information will be included

15
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:26,770
as part of the public
record of the hearing.

16
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:30,500
So it's for all posterity,
it's a terrific way

17
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:35,060
of getting that information into
the decision making process.

18
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:41,520
It also is helpful because later
after the decision has been made,

19
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:47,230
there may be some insight that can be
gained when exploring what the intent

20
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:52,350
of a specific provision as part
of that decision might be.

21
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:56,810
So that legislative intent,
and that written paper trail,

22
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:59,330
can be very, very helpful.

23
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:06,240
I encourage organizations of all
types to use the opportunity

24
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:12,970
of submitting written testimony as
part of their advocacy strategies.

25
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:18,410
In addition, when the hearing is held,
there is an opportunity for

26
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:24,070
a representative of the view of the
organization, whatever stakeholder group,

27
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:29,610
coalition it is,
to present the testimony publicly.

28
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:36,661
The oral testimony is often more brief and
more concise than that written document.

29
00:02:36,661 --> 00:02:39,752
But that written document
is helpful again,

30
00:02:39,752 --> 00:02:46,200
in honing in on the key points that will
be included in that oral presentation.

31
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:51,114
The event of a hearing can
be used strategically by

32
00:02:51,114 --> 00:02:55,560
the decision maker to
show either momentum or

33
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,961
a lack of momentum around a topic.

34
00:02:58,961 --> 00:03:05,960
And also can generate a lot of press
coverage and media coverage which can then

35
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:12,470
be used to perpetuate whatever
the decision or topic may be.

36
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:18,570
So with that in mind,
we think about crafting written testimony,

37
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:22,700
the structure is very similar to a letter.

38
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:27,440
And the structure includes many of
the points we discussed earlier as part of

39
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,040
that eight-minute rule that I like to use.

40
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,920
So the first thing we do
is we identify ourselves,

41
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:39,880
our organization, and
the reason why we are there.

42
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:44,700
So it's addressed to the chair of
the committee, the committee members.

43
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:51,650
It will be very clear on what the goal and
the outcome is that we would like to see.

44
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:55,430
And then it will include
a thorough explanation,

45
00:03:55,430 --> 00:04:00,530
drawing on that expertise that
we talked about in step one.

46
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:04,270
Written testimony, as I mentioned,
can be longer than the oral remarks,

47
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:08,160
but should not digress.

48
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,840
So it should remain succinct and

49
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:17,878
relevant because it will be there
as part of the public record.

50
00:04:17,878 --> 00:04:22,675
At the hearing it's
important to realize that as

51
00:04:22,675 --> 00:04:28,759
the representative from
the organization you may be filmed,

52
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:33,620
and you may be part of media coverage.

53
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:41,172
So the preparation around oral delivery
of the testimony is very, very important.

54
00:04:41,172 --> 00:04:46,232
It's helpful to think about
identifying three main

55
00:04:46,232 --> 00:04:52,444
points in oral testimony, and
boiling it down to five minutes.

56
00:04:52,444 --> 00:04:57,207
Often there will be
requirements that testimony is

57
00:04:57,207 --> 00:05:00,685
limited to three to five minutes.

58
00:05:00,685 --> 00:05:05,169
So sometimes,
even there will be a timer there, so

59
00:05:05,169 --> 00:05:08,313
the testimony will be just cut off.

60
00:05:08,313 --> 00:05:14,270
So knowing that ahead of time will
help you in preparing brief delivery.

61
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:18,502
It's so important to be
painfully basic and simple.

62
00:05:18,502 --> 00:05:21,913
And again, going back to etiquette and
protocol, and

63
00:05:21,913 --> 00:05:25,622
understanding that the audience
of decision makers may not

64
00:05:25,622 --> 00:05:29,350
have any background in the topic
that you're discussing.

65
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:32,480
So keeping simple language,

66
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:36,390
avoiding acronyms,
things like that will be very helpful.

67
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,368
And finally,

68
00:05:37,368 --> 00:05:42,350
going back to one of the points I made
in the very first part of the module.

69
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:47,567
Thinking about honing in on the facts and
not becoming emotional,

70
00:05:47,567 --> 00:05:52,785
and trying to avoid any type of
interaction with a decision maker so

71
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:58,510
that you're not distracted from
the importance of the substance.

72
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:02,420
And repeating your points sort of over and
over again,

73
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:05,484
which may seem unnecessary as the expert.

74
00:06:05,484 --> 00:06:06,131
But again,

75
00:06:06,131 --> 00:06:10,337
recognizing that the audience is not
likely to have a background on this.
