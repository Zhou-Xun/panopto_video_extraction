1
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:24,170
So quiet. Well, thanks for joining us on a cold day today.

2
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:30,380
We're going to be talking about economy because there is no class.

3
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:38,430
This is a week from today. We're going to move up our autism lecture because I can't tell you everything I need to tell you about autism.

4
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:42,740
All right. Just remember something among yourselves.

5
00:00:52,930 --> 00:01:06,010
Eerily quiet apartments blocks so easy.

6
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:28,150
Just as many as a. Secretaries should do.

7
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:39,870
All right. All right. Now. So.

8
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:51,270
So I know you haven't done the reading or most of you probably have not done the readings yet for today, but hopefully you will come back tomorrow.

9
00:02:46,100 --> 00:03:02,070
All. It's.

10
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:20,230
I think I can give you anything.

11
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:28,460
All right. All right.

12
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:32,470
Start again. Sorry about that. So today we're going to talk about autism.

13
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:35,050
Before I talk about autism, I'll tell you about kids.

14
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:45,219
So the first part of today's lecture will be an introduction to kind of how we think about what the teaching mental hygiene kids,

15
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:51,700
specifically the kind of broad introduction to the idea of developmental psychopathology or developmental psychology.

16
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:56,860
I will talk about some risk factors for autism in the latter half of today's lecture.

17
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:03,370
On Monday, we'll talk about the autism epidemic and sort of the factors that are driving and contributed to that.

18
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:09,990
There is no class a week from today, so take a breather, relax, but get your check point in.

19
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,180
So that is due on Wednesday. Still, that is checkpoint number four.

20
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:19,840
So any questions about stakeholder checkpoint, something like interactions and contact?

21
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:26,740
No, you don't need to contact them. If you if you are planning to contact them, I'd like to know that.

22
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:31,209
So I am going to talk to you about whether that's a good idea or a necessary idea.

23
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:35,590
So you don't need to contact a stakeholder. You can get our website.

24
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,110
It does. So it doesn't it doesn't have to be a phone call.

25
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:45,940
But if that is something you want to do, I can certainly advise you whether that's something that would be necessary.

26
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:53,450
Yeah. Of course that is for the specific stakeholder as well.

27
00:04:55,570 --> 00:05:01,900
Yeah. Yeah. And and this the the purpose of this checkpoint is to help you convey to me what you're thinking about.

28
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:08,240
So the more information you can give me, the better. There are questions about check point.

29
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:16,729
This is just to remind you, this can be a government source like this doesn't have to be a community member.

30
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:20,209
It doesn't have to be a TED Talk. But it can also it can be a TED Talk, right?

31
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:27,200
A kind of and everybody's project is going to look a little different. You don't have to have 15 things.

32
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:31,609
You need to have at least one, you know, for your final paper.

33
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:35,629
And so it doesn't mean that just because you put them in this table that you're going to they're going to show up in the final name.

34
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:40,459
And that's the other thing, the kind of I don't go back and like double check, like, did you use this one?

35
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:46,640
I just want you to be thinking about this because I know sometimes you can kind of get behind the eight ball with the project.

36
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:53,480
And it's the point of these check points is to make sure that you're thinking about it the whole way through the questions.

37
00:05:56,530 --> 00:06:00,840
So. So how many of you have kids so far?

38
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:07,510
So, of course. But you might. Okay, but the point is, I'm going to start off by workshop.

39
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:14,459
And so this is just the joke here is with more and more kids, males, you get a shot of bourbon.

40
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:24,000
But let's let's talk about what kids do because what kids do and sort of how we think about development and mental health is really important for us,

41
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:32,370
thinking about something like autism or ADHD or these other kind of conditions that tend to onset or certainly get diagnosed in childhood.

42
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:38,759
So what kids do in a very broad sense we can think about is for three main periods.

43
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:48,149
So basically before school and a zero to age five, the main thing that kids are learning how to do are becoming forming attachment relationships.

44
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:54,209
This is usually with the parents or other caregivers. They're learning final gross motor control.

45
00:06:54,210 --> 00:07:00,760
So this is, you know, I'm sure you've seen or maybe you have cousins or nephews that, you know, they try to eat and they're just covered in food.

46
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:04,559
Right. They don't have fine motor control. They're learning how to crawl.

47
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:14,130
They're learning how to walk. They're learning how to communicate. So a rule of thumb is that on kind of in the in America, about 50% of kids,

48
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:22,380
I do a little bit more walking by about age one and a similar number are talking or have a few words by age two.

49
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:29,970
Okay. So basically prior, this is important because I mean, when we talk about on Monday about when autism is diagnosed,

50
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:38,010
which we kind of start screening for that nowadays around age 2 to 2 and a half, kids are not even speaking prior to that.

51
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:46,170
Right. So all communication between kids and their caregivers prior to age two is nonverbal.

52
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:49,890
And then it would become more verbal. As we as we grow up,

53
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:59,640
you have to differentiate yourself from your environment and you need to learn self-control and sort of compliance so you learn the word no, right?

54
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:05,159
Once you're in school, the main things that kids are working on, there are school adjustments.

55
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:10,590
So a lot of this is just like being in the right place at the right time and knowing how to act in that setting.

56
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,830
They're learning how to read, they're learning how to do math,

57
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:21,780
but like a lot of it is really just socialization and like learning how to work with others, learning rule governed behavior.

58
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:26,729
So pro-social contact looking, learning that it's appropriate to just like wrestle constantly,

59
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:32,639
which is what my ten year old does whenever he's got friends over, which is fine at home, but like not at school.

60
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,840
Right. And then as you get older, as you get into this adolescent period, again,

61
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:42,570
this transition to secondary school, more higher order achievement and pro-social skills,

62
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:49,739
this is the first time we really see form close relationships in the way that you would understand them now within and across

63
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:57,660
gender and like that is not relationships just based on like a shared love of Legos and then forming a sense of self identity.

64
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:09,390
Like who are you as a person? So because prior to age five, which is where autism begins, this is what's happened.

65
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:16,259
So what that what that means is that the way that we assess the mental health of

66
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:19,800
children is very different than the way we assess the mental health of adults.

67
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:26,730
So, first of all, even before age two, kids are not speaking like there's no communication, no verbal communication.

68
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:34,379
It also means that kids might act in one setting differently in a way that they act in another setting,

69
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:38,100
or they might feel comfortable with certain people and not comfortable with other people.

70
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:44,489
Right. So if you've ever sort of someone's ever handed you a young child and then they realize you're not their mom or dad,

71
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:50,340
and then they start screaming like that is that's a very normal behavior for a child to do.

72
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:58,620
So what it means is that when we think about assessing anything about children's mental health is that we need to have both a clinical appraisal,

73
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:03,960
but also looking at things like the parent child context.

74
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:06,450
I'm going to come back to number one in a second.

75
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:15,569
The everything we're talking about has to be understood in relation to where is this child in that in

76
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:20,400
the course of development and what are their the relationships that they that are in their lives.

77
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:27,450
And you must have multiple sources of information. So don't just rely on the parent, but you should be talking to the parent, the teacher.

78
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:33,120
If you do observation of the child, that's ideal. And if the child's able to self report on a questionnaire, you could do that.

79
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,720
But most of the time we're actually not talking to the kid that much.

80
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:41,850
You might we we'll talk to the kid, but you really hear about how these other variables are coming in.

81
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:48,870
So the thing that I want to call attention to is this first piece about psychometric, robust measures.

82
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:54,650
And so with that, what are some. I think it's here.

83
00:10:54,980 --> 00:11:04,100
So as an example of a sacred, metrically, robust measure, this is an example of things that we do for different, different kids.

84
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:07,370
And so this is all those principles that were just on that slide are illustrated here.

85
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:10,560
So the first is these are just three, three examples.

86
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:16,770
So the first is you notice that this fairly scale of for development, this is only used for ages 1 to 42 months.

87
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:22,610
So I think it is older than that. You would not use this scale. So that's that's very different than adulthood, right?

88
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:25,730
I wouldn't give you a depression scale and say I don't use this for 40 year olds.

89
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,820
That's not how we think about depression.

90
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:32,930
We think about we can talk to a can use the same instrument for a 40 year old as we can, a 20 year old as we can't, a 60 year old.

91
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:37,100
You can see that it's assessing several different domains.

92
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:43,700
So psychomotor behavioral reading, this kind of mental development. And the other thing is that you can see that it's been standardized,

93
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:47,029
which means they've given this to thousands and thousands of kids and they're like,

94
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:51,559
on average, most most kids are here, but there's a distribution of that.

95
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,540
Again, we don't think about that when we think about depression.

96
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:57,979
We don't talk about like the distribution of depressive symptoms in the United States.

97
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:04,610
We talk about the percent of people who have high depressive symptoms or this percent of people who meet diagnostic criteria here.

98
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:14,720
Instead, what we're talking about is a distribution on the distribution on the scale.

99
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:22,770
And if this is the 50th percentile, what I what I want to know is, is your kid over here, you know,

100
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:30,950
90th percentile or they over here on the tests and depending on the scale, this might be an area of concern or this might be very constructive.

101
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:33,730
But there's not there's not a threshold on that.

102
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:42,650
You would never give a parent a standard that's sort of saying, like, your kid has high autism symptoms or something like that.

103
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:43,700
That's not something we do.

104
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:51,560
Instead, what we would be saying is, on your psychomotor development, your kid is in the 50th percentile, your kid is in the 75th percentile.

105
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:55,010
Right. And that's and by that, they mean at this age,

106
00:12:55,010 --> 00:13:01,250
like 75% of kids are doing this thing or like the average the average score of kids in your in this age group.

107
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:06,979
So then you can see these other ones again, have these specific age groups. They're also standardized to specific settings.

108
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,630
So these are standardized in the United States.

109
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:14,360
We don't fully understand why, but like child development looks a lot different in different countries.

110
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:21,589
Right? There's different cultural norms. There's different standards in terms of standards in terms of the different cultural norms.

111
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:28,910
Right. In terms of these things. And so it's important to think about that broader context of this kind of geographic context, etc.

112
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:33,950
So again. You would never get as a grown up as an adult.

113
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:40,640
You would never get. You would never go to a psychiatrist or a mental health professional and have them and then come and say,

114
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:44,320
your depressive symptoms are in the 75th percentile. That would never happen.

115
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:50,090
Instead, they would say, you know, you meet that criteria, but for kids, this is exactly what you would get.

116
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:57,050
You would get. This is where your child is on this distribution. And the reason we do that is because there is a lot of variation.

117
00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:06,290
So on some scale of psychomotor development, we might consider this entire range or this entire and I'm sorry you can't see on the side,

118
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:12,199
but like this entire range might be considered normative and so and not an area of concern.

119
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:17,450
And what I'm trying to identify are kids that I think might be on a riskier trajectory versus kids that are.

120
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:24,290
I'm less concerned about being on a riskier trajectory. This is just another example here.

121
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:27,739
These are ones that are used on observed characteristics.

122
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:30,920
And I'm going to show you an example of this in a minute for autism.

123
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:35,030
But this is literally like just watching a child play.

124
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:36,530
What is the child doing? All right.

125
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:42,710
Again, for a sustained assessment of depression, we wouldn't just watch a person, you know, like do an activity, a social interaction.

126
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:46,640
But again, why are we doing this? Because the kid doesn't speak. We don't have it.

127
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:56,840
They don't have a way. Not only do they not have that little motor control to make sounds, to make words, they don't know what those words mean.

128
00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:03,620
They can't tell you. I am feeling lonely. That is not a construct that a child can say.

129
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:07,970
Even if they did say it. That doesn't necessarily mean that what?

130
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:13,580
It doesn't necessarily mean what you think it might mean. So I am I can I say this?

131
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:17,240
And of course, I couldn't take my own advice. So one of my child was my son was five or six.

132
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:27,410
He told me that he was hearing voices sometimes and I was very concerned.

133
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:34,060
And so I have a good friend who's a child psychologist. And so I called her up and said, I know I'm being paranoid, but my son, you know,

134
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:39,020
Max says that he's hearing voices and she's like she's like, what are they saying?

135
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:42,319
And I'm like, they don't seem to be saying anything in particular, like I've asked them.

136
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,260
And she's like, Don't worry. She's like, kids hear voices all the time.

137
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:50,330
Like, they just sort of like the idea that, like, that's a that's not that's not your voice in your head.

138
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:56,390
Like that's a new concept to like, oh, like these thoughts, the voice in your heads saying like, it's gross.

139
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:59,870
Like he was projecting that as though it was from outside of him.

140
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,660
Right. And again, so that's the I hear what I'm saying.

141
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:09,230
Like we can't just like use the concepts that we have as adults and extrapolate to kids and instead we do this sort.

142
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:20,670
So just again, in general, when we think about kids that you talk about dimensional,

143
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:26,160
that is like these kind of big distributions of symptoms that's built into everything we're talking about.

144
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:28,800
All these tools are standardized to a local population.

145
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:35,490
You yourselves have experienced this in the form of, for example, like standardized testing, like I'm sure you've experienced.

146
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:41,670
I'm sure you took some test tests at some point and you didn't get a score that told you maybe they had some words about,

147
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:44,610
like, achievement, but like, they really the big thing was like, what percentile?

148
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:52,620
It's it's the reason we do this is because there's so much natural variation in developmental trajectories on assessing kids.

149
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:58,890
Just because a kid is in the 20th percentile at six months doesn't mean they're going to be in the 20th percentile at two years.

150
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:02,310
We don't really understand the sources of this variation.

151
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:05,489
And so there's a real we don't want to apologize,

152
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:10,230
something that is just normal just just normal variation that there's no need to clinically intervene.

153
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:14,820
And that's what we're trying to do. It's like when when is it warranted to have clinical intervention?

154
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:19,320
And again, because kids can't tell us about their own, their own minds,

155
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:25,440
their own self, internal experiences and the fact that especially for young kids,

156
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:29,550
the ways that kids behave really changes across different settings so they can

157
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:35,639
run away with their parents another way at school and other way with friends, etc. You have to have multiple raters.

158
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:43,200
You really need to talk to as many people as possible. And ideally you're talking to your assessment that kid in multiple different settings.

159
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,150
So at school with peers and with parents.

160
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:57,330
So this is going to this piece in particular is going to come up when we talk about autism, because this is very time consuming and expensive to do.

161
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:03,540
This is not readily available. This is very expensive and time consuming.

162
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:11,460
And so this will come up in on Monday. But that's that's the kind of gold standard of how we assess kids.

163
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:17,820
So that's all I'm going to tell you about children more generally. Before I tell you about autism, let me ask their questions here.

164
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:27,660
How to think about child. Okay.

165
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:35,229
So we're talking about autism. I'm going to tell you, we're in form of the case definition today and then I'll tell you some risk factors,

166
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:39,640
including we're gonna talk about the wait for paper of immunizations, of vaccines and autism.

167
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:46,510
And then I'll tell you about gestational characteristics and parental characteristics that may or may not be related to autism risk.

168
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:49,180
So before we get there, let's talk about case definition.

169
00:18:50,200 --> 00:19:01,210
So in 2012, when the DSM five is released, we get a massive change to the diagnostic criteria for autism.

170
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:05,230
We get for the first time this thing that we now call autism spectrum disorder.

171
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:12,010
Prior to the DSM five, we had scientists.

172
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:15,729
Prior to the DSM five, there were four different diagnoses.

173
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:22,180
There was something called autistic disorder. There was Asperger's disorder, there was something called childhood disintegrate, descended,

174
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:26,980
repetitive disorder, and then pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified.

175
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:31,780
All of those now are underneath the criteria of this autism spectrum disorder.

176
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:38,589
And it's kind of reflecting the fact that we think all of these, although this is now up for debate,

177
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:45,760
but we think all of these are kind of representing different different expressions of the same underlying process,

178
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:50,950
and that the interventions that we would give to a child with autism disorder are the

179
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:54,370
same as the type of interventions we might offer to a kid with Asperger's syndrome.

180
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:58,670
So it doesn't really inform clinical care to happen to be these distinct diagnoses, right?

181
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:04,510
So that's how they kind of come at it. What is autism spectrum now?

182
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:08,280
So according to DSM five, it's this a3c must be met.

183
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:12,909
So the first is persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction.

184
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:20,140
So the first element is social. So remember back to what I just told you about how kids act differently around different people.

185
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:27,219
So the very first thing is social. And a child to have autism spectrum must have all of the three.

186
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:30,910
Three of the following first is deficits in social emotional reciprocity.

187
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:37,900
This is where you and I make eye contact. Parents with kids with autism often will have difficulty holding sustained eye contact.

188
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:43,180
There is deficits and nonverbal communication. So I point out over here you look okay.

189
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:48,220
So a child with autism often won't understand or won't follow the finger as to

190
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:52,930
what I'm showing and then deficits in developing and maintaining relationships.

191
00:20:54,160 --> 00:21:01,479
So maybe that, again, this is really difficult to symmetric, especially when we're really talking about two, three and four year olds.

192
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:06,100
Right. So I don't know if you've got how many of you have like young cousins or something like three or four.

193
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:12,530
Do they have friends? Yeah, but like, are they mostly around, like, whoever is, like, at the playground?

194
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:19,940
Yeah. So it's not like a, you know, they might know somebody like my son was biting children, it looks like fighting his friends.

195
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:25,800
And that was like the way he showed affection was I have to get notes from the daycare constantly like Max has been it.

196
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:31,910
And so anyway, so the point is, is like that's the, you know, somehow we're going to metric that.

197
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:35,780
The second is these restricted repetitive patterns of behavior,

198
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:42,560
interest or activities by at least through the following so stereotyped or repetitive speech, motor movements or use of objects.

199
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:49,190
I'm going to show you some of this in a second. Adherence to routines and rituals we can think of.

200
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:53,569
Think about things like ritualized patterns of behavior, resistance to change.

201
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:56,660
Now, all toddlers like nobody likes changing things.

202
00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:02,299
But the notion here would be that this would be really difficult for a child to to sort of say,

203
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:06,200
like, I know we were going to go to the zoo today, but now we're going to go to the museum.

204
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:12,500
Like that would be a big change for many kids, but especially for kids who have had autism spectrum,

205
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:19,009
very restricted, fixated interest and then potentially hyper or hypo reactivity to sensory input.

206
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:22,910
So kids will often complain about different kinds of textures being difficult to square.

207
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:27,049
And the third is that they sometimes must be present in early childhood,

208
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:36,140
but they might not sort of be fully diagnosed or understood until later when social demands exceed expectations or capacity.

209
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:42,889
So and then within the spectrum, the way this gets organized is by the level of severity.

210
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:50,690
So whether kids have need, like relatively little support or very intense support,

211
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:54,950
I'm going to show you some videos of this like range of the spectrum in a few minutes.

212
00:22:54,950 --> 00:23:03,950
But before I do, I want to I want to show you this video to give you an understanding of sort of both the challenges with diagnosing,

213
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:09,980
but actually what what people are actually looking for when they're trying to make this diagnosis at this young age.

214
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:21,110
So this is from Kennedy, which is probably the best place on the planet for autism intervention to contact eliminated disorders that can

215
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:29,190
include who you hear about in terms of dreams tutorial illustrating the signs of autism spectrum disorders are FDA.

216
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:33,890
You will see a video of ongoing orals with an BE.

217
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:40,040
You will find your child with typical development followed by a child who shows early signs of nasty

218
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:46,340
developmental things are often indicative and within these days all fall into three main categories.

219
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:56,930
These include active communication sharing, joint making, social connections and the one with so to a group again the opportunity through play.

220
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:02,860
This 19 month old child did not show signs of LSD.

221
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:14,050
You can't have children. Don't play with the ball. He quickly integrated the event into his play.

222
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:18,160
He pointed out that the ball and subsequent to the lady.

223
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:41,270
You're going to have a lot of challenges ahead and they're making some yummy food.

224
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:50,090
He understands that the food, his bones, the plates and eating together actually creates a contemporary activity.

225
00:24:50,210 --> 00:25:02,090
He remains aware of the people nearby. He enjoys incorporating social interaction into play and offering a bite to make you think,

226
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:07,130
to pay attention to the lady and the doll and the plate and food all at once.

227
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:12,230
He shares his excitement about the place with the lady looking at her and smiling

228
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:18,260
after the comments of the food he likes to play and language to her idea.

229
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:24,250
So he has to.

230
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:31,450
In her daily action with the contents of the attic.

231
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:44,770
This helps him to learn new skills and at the same time synchronize actions with actions of others.

232
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:54,690
And I think there is a feeling that you.

233
00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:00,570
This 19 month old child decides that the SD.

234
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:13,560
You have the need to turn it into a phone. He needs to share his enjoyment of the thing with others.

235
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:23,010
It does not matter what others will show up on this evening.

236
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:27,020
Since I. So. So.

237
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:40,170
And so I was right there and I was one of the stuff to do here.

238
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:45,120
He didn't do anything with the phone when when he called.

239
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:50,790
You can respond later. Leave early.

240
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:55,700
Although it didn't alter the others,

241
00:26:55,710 --> 00:27:18,660
as I think I'd have to turn the clock to try to stop trying to get into my way from from of the of the age she begins to take on him.

242
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:25,290
Although he wanted the tipping, the topic is my mother might make a social connection with her.

243
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:32,210
He didn't try to communicate with his plan to keep his social game going.

244
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:42,640
So you're going to finish this. This is one of your readings for next week, so I encourage you to watch all four of those videos.

245
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:49,310
But, um, what stood out to you about anything stand up to you about those two videos.

246
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:57,530
Was an obvious to you that one of those kids had challenges and the other was it.

247
00:27:57,990 --> 00:28:02,670
So it's very difficult to identify the things that we're talking about.

248
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:09,670
So when I talk about the need for this kind of multiple raters, multiple settings,

249
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:15,210
very time consuming, this is, again, this, this to get to this accurate diagnosis, this is important.

250
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:23,610
But it also makes it shows that how difficult it is when we're talking about a situation where somebody can't tell you about what's going on.

251
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:32,760
We have to infer what the child is doing. I think it's the lack of this lack of social context, etc.

252
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:36,600
So it's not obvious often, especially at this very young age.

253
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:44,440
So another thing I'm not going to I'm not going to talk about this in detail today,

254
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:53,260
but it is important to understand that part of what makes this a difficult thing for us to know about from the public health perspective is data.

255
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:58,990
So we do not have a national survey that has data on autism.

256
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:03,669
The only kind of national health care data that would cover kids is Medicaid,

257
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:09,400
which does not cover everybody that's on the lower income level to qualify for Medicaid.

258
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:17,980
And most of our estimates on autism are relying on health or education records,

259
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:24,940
which means these are the only records that we have of autism, are situations that have come to someone's attention.

260
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:29,020
They've come to a clinician's attention or they'd come to a teacher's attention.

261
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:32,840
This is also going to matter when we talk about the autism epidemic.

262
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:39,760
So most of our statistics on autism are coming from what we might think of it, like a sentinel sort of.

263
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:47,270
So either a health care provider that's made a diagnosis or an education system that has determined the child has an eye,

264
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:51,220
requires additional supports because of an autism diagnosis.

265
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:55,860
There is a autism monitoring network where we are.

266
00:29:56,020 --> 00:30:01,580
We are a site here now. But this is it. This is the states that are that our data on autism comes from.

267
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:05,360
So this is not all of the United States, obviously. Yeah.

268
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:09,749
When you say that some of it comes from education records and like teachers,

269
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:17,579
if they alert like parents or whatever are teachers informs of like symptoms to look for and autism like is that part of the cause?

270
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:24,780
So it's the what the what the teacher is going to be alerting to is the child is being disruptive in class or is off task or something.

271
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:33,390
So there and what will often happen then is that that will result in a conversation and then an assessment to determine so the assessment.

272
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:38,579
But um, and so to that, to your point,

273
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:46,530
their teachers are certainly they have a lot larger samples to draw from in terms of like is this behavior normative or,

274
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:51,540
you know, where is this the hundreds of kids over the years?

275
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:56,330
Are they do they think it's their job to diagnose smell?

276
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,020
And most of these symptoms will have been present in preschool.

277
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:03,269
Right. So like they're before kids before kids are getting there.

278
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:05,100
So that and, you know,

279
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:12,659
mostly preschool teachers or daycare workers are not they're not going to have the expertize whatsoever to kind of look at this.

280
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:17,160
But but that most of it is they will be identified if kids are identified in those kind of setting.

281
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:22,080
It's because of that disruption probably. Good question.

282
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:27,900
So given that there's limitations of data, what do we know about autism in the United States?

283
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:35,850
Well, in this, the CDC estimates that about 2% of kids under age eight have had autism spectrum or have autism spectrum.

284
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:41,850
Diagnosis and diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder. W.H.O. estimates a much lower percentage.

285
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,680
It's only about half a percent of kids.

286
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:53,880
There is a very strong male to female ratios about men are boys are four times more likely to have an autism diagnosis relative to girls.

287
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:57,840
And typically, this diagnosis is happening prior to age five.

288
00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:06,270
So I've used this term spectrum multiple times. Let me tell you, kind of let me give you two videos that are meant to illustrate the anchors.

289
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:12,960
That is the most I'm going to say the least, functionally impaired and as an example, a very high functional impairment.

290
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:20,430
To kind of give you a sense of both. We just showed you the video how difficult it is to assess young children.

291
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:25,140
But now talking about older kids, like what is this? What is the spectrum actually look like?

292
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:35,370
I live my mom and dad is out in the world and.

293
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:43,540
I also have some brands expecting more like I'm going to take you into my world

294
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:50,020
and my journey and show you how to look into all sorts of different ways.

295
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:55,090
It's not a logical system, as you may know. I knew I wanted to be a different.

296
00:32:55,630 --> 00:33:00,790
Cupid's different. I am different. However, if that to you, it doesn't have to hold you back.

297
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:04,450
It's insisting on me to find out what it really means to be stick.

298
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:14,960
It's a kind of autism I have is called Asperger's syndrome.

299
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:18,740
And sometimes it makes me see things a little bit differently.

300
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:24,650
I get very sensitive and I can't control it.

301
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:31,340
And sometimes it's a bad thing because all the other kids are laughing and I'm just crying,

302
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:43,100
screaming things and every single thing, even things on the living have a personality and life is just to those issues.

303
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:48,500
And I pick up one and I feel like there's a power to be something that feel left out or something.

304
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:55,460
I don't like saying certain words because they just make me feel unhappy.

305
00:33:55,670 --> 00:34:00,350
A lot of people with autism sometimes mix as you sense as I come out of it.

306
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:11,060
I can be, you know, was used to describe a word as being slimy on the clay because I just want it to start off powerful when I said it.

307
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:12,950
Oh, and other people said it.

308
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:21,830
I allow people to have lunch and do something about it and they don't mean to be mean, but it just hurt my feelings because of my sensitivity.

309
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:31,010
So. So what is autism? People with autism have problems relating to what is making sense of the world around them.

310
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:39,170
Sometimes it's like the where the brain works, but what they don't know causes it is a much more likely to be autistic than girls.

311
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:45,650
And it can run in families. Autism is McGrath or one in every hundred people as autistic.

312
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:50,650
And it comes in all shapes and sizes. I get very interesting crowds.

313
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:57,640
I have anxiety issues. I'm sometimes easily distracted, easily annoyed.

314
00:34:57,910 --> 00:35:04,240
It's been difficult for me. I love the how to conversation.

315
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:11,920
I need to try to think very hard. It's if someone does touch me, I say, Can you please not do it again?

316
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:17,890
I sort of feel sometimes like and people will try to hurt their feelings.

317
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:33,080
Uh, uh, an uncomfortable level at uh, when people, people's know, I, it's kind of, I can't describe it.

318
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:37,090
I'm sorry. I thought rude. It's private. So, um.

319
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:45,870
So what's next? This is obviously, you know, very well edited for public consumption, but like what?

320
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:49,400
Those kind of things keep telling you a little bit about what stood out to you.

321
00:35:50,540 --> 00:36:00,980
Can you describe. So I guess like the usage of Asperger's or Asperger's I keep saying for him,

322
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:11,630
but of course I have heard recently that it's like not really phased out or is more phased out and just like preferring using the SD.

323
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:16,910
Yes. But the experiences that kids describe.

324
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:23,629
Yeah, I can understand how it would be like maybe more difficult to diagnose or like potentially this diagnosis because

325
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:29,900
a lot of like symptoms are like behaviors could be associated with other like disorders or mental illnesses.

326
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:33,380
Anxiety, ADHD, attention. Yeah.

327
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:38,610
Yeah. So, yeah. The kids explain feeling anxious in crowded areas, right?

328
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:46,130
Feeling distracted. Right. So, like, not only is it the diagnosis of something, it's the differential diagnosis of this versus other things.

329
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:54,739
But I was surprised by how aware they were of like how different their experiences were for such a young age.

330
00:36:54,740 --> 00:37:04,060
It was like a very immature explanation where I'm not even sure I would be as aware of the way I think and how that compares to others at that age.

331
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:12,480
So I thought that was really interesting. Kids who are very, very able to verbalize what their experiences.

332
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:18,210
So now I'm going to show you a video that's a little difficult to watch, which is of a kid who's not able to.

333
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:26,300
So, again, this is the other end of that spectrum. On morning.

334
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:36,969
They have no idea.

335
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:49,300
The first time we have Ebola was before I had to choose from sitting on my console, and that is something I have always seen before.

336
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:57,700
I have heard so much attention nonstop on this.

337
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:12,640
Tyler, Texas is better for it.

338
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:21,070
No longer. New Orleans is an insult and an insult for three reasons.

339
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:25,510
Is one of those five?

340
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:29,720
I don't sell them whatsoever.

341
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:38,860
But I always thought, you know, we weren't responding at all and.

342
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:45,310
So and again these videos are in the slideshow but.

343
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:54,140
Is this family dealing with? It's got repetitive behaviors.

344
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,469
Right. This, this and this.

345
00:38:55,470 --> 00:39:01,080
Many people talk, you know, people people talk about kids rocking or kind of other self-soothing behaviors is a self-interested behavior.

346
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:07,050
This kid is been in a group home, so he's not been able to be at home with his family.

347
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:11,490
This kid is not able to verbalize what's happening to him.

348
00:39:11,490 --> 00:39:14,219
They keep saying she has no idea what is going on.

349
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:20,580
They don't know what is going on this because on many medications, there are no medications to treat autism.

350
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:22,260
There are no medications to report.

351
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:30,360
This kid is having this taking medications to help manage symptoms that are expressed being expressed in these behaviors.

352
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:35,940
So Depakote is a is a major antiepileptic drug.

353
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:44,490
So. I want you to understand, we're talking about the spectrum where both of these families are represented there.

354
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:47,849
Right. And are these I couldn't see families in the first line,

355
00:39:47,850 --> 00:40:01,500
but these individuals and so it's this this will also come up when we talk about next week about where the increase in autism has come from.

356
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:07,950
That is, has it come from this part of the distribution that we just watched, kids with very severe ends,

357
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:20,580
or has it come from kids at the most functioning, most, you know, the highest sort of able to articulate, like where has it come from or is this okay?

358
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,230
So and which of these two is going to be easier for a clinician to identify?

359
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:34,740
This. So you can see you can see the setup as to what we're going to talk about in terms of like next week about how

360
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:41,400
access to resources has shaped who gets an autism diagnosis and what with that autism diagnosis looks like.

361
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:46,200
Okay. All right. So questions about that before I.

362
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:53,150
Yeah. What's the purpose of including.

363
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:59,490
Those two sides of the spectrum together under one label, and they're so different.

364
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:03,610
Like how you treat diagnosed cancer.

365
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:10,930
So, I mean, this is the fundamental problem with the DSM because what we are describing are symptoms.

366
00:41:11,530 --> 00:41:18,790
We are not you're describing what things look like. And this kid has stereotyped stereotypical behavior.

367
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:22,600
He's got deficits in social processing.

368
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:27,580
He may not even be able to verbally express himself. So some kids are nonverbal that have autism.

369
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:37,360
And this stuff started when he was young. Right. And so. Now, does that mean that the same fundamental biology is represented in both cases?

370
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:40,750
No, but like we don't know the fundamental neurobiology of autism.

371
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:45,870
And so this is the very crude way that we have to approach that.

372
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:54,690
So, I mean, your point is well taken and it's part of why people want like this is part of why people like the idea of different diagnoses.

373
00:41:55,080 --> 00:42:01,889
The problem is, is that when we have these very when we have very the prior version versions.

374
00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:02,400
Sorry, here we are.

375
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:10,890
Kids moving between these diagnoses or a kid might get a diagnosis of ADHD and then actually somebody else we get an assessment of autism,

376
00:42:10,890 --> 00:42:14,730
especially with Asperger's. This was very common for people not to get diagnosed till they were adults.

377
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:23,490
So like they had other diagnoses when they were kids, you know, and then they so these aren't that good, even the smaller versions of them.

378
00:42:23,610 --> 00:42:30,030
Right. But your point is well taken. Right. How do we what is the what is the clinical utility of that, I think is a really important thing.

379
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:38,310
Yeah. Other questions? Yeah. I mean, one thing that I was wondering about in terms of like a male to female ratio is because I know I've heard a lot.

380
00:42:38,310 --> 00:42:42,390
And it was said in the video that like more noise, men are more likely to have autism.

381
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:49,380
But I do know I, I read like recently that like women just have to be diagnosed later.

382
00:42:50,130 --> 00:42:53,340
Like it's not necessarily a later onset, but it's like noticed later on in life.

383
00:42:53,350 --> 00:42:58,709
And I was wondering, like, you're like information about that or like insight because it's just like interesting to me.

384
00:42:58,710 --> 00:43:03,660
Like, we still think like that. Maybe more men have it, but is that really true?

385
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:07,920
Women are just being diagnosed later like so. Yeah, so that's a great question.

386
00:43:08,490 --> 00:43:11,580
So a 4 to 1 ratio is really high.

387
00:43:12,210 --> 00:43:18,390
So the only other one that we have is the flip is for eating disorders, which is about 10 to 1 for women relative to men.

388
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:24,090
If you look at all eating disorders writ large, it's less so for like binge eating, but more so for anorexia.

389
00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:29,490
So so it's not out of the question that we would see big gender ratios.

390
00:43:30,690 --> 00:43:38,879
The I don't this I think is real. This is really so the your point is well taken though that especially with the

391
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:43,890
and we could look at the most higher highest functioning kind of questions.

392
00:43:43,890 --> 00:43:50,280
Would we see that? Because that's where I would expect to see the later diagnosis, which is is probably true.

393
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:57,090
But we can we could look into it. But I this this I think is true. Other questions.

394
00:44:00,590 --> 00:44:03,950
All right. Well, it's going to get worse before it gets better. But this.

395
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:09,860
Okay. I already told you all of this. And this is a screenshot from that video, the Kennedy Krieger video.

396
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:15,110
Oh, wait, we're not there yet. Sorry. Okay, time of the week. I get ahead of myself.

397
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,900
So these are just some some snapshots in time.

398
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:24,740
Thankfully, there are a few studies that we've looked at kids over time to kind of understand what happens to symptoms as kids age.

399
00:44:24,770 --> 00:44:28,790
So remember I told you, just because you're at this at this point in the curve,

400
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:32,420
at two years as a if you're going to be at this point in the curve in ten years.

401
00:44:32,930 --> 00:44:37,820
So what this what I'm showing you is age of the kid and the Y axis is functioning.

402
00:44:37,830 --> 00:44:43,550
So higher levels are showing better functioning of kids. And so these are all kids who have got some, some sort of ASD.

403
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:50,800
And what you can see is that at age three they're all now like nobody's kind of above the 50th percentile.

404
00:44:50,810 --> 00:44:52,040
They're all kind of right here.

405
00:44:52,340 --> 00:45:01,020
But there are some groups in this kind of high functioning group that by age 14, so by the time they become adolescents, is actually doing quite well.

406
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:04,540
Right. So this is this reflects that, you know,

407
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:10,040
this is this type of graph is the type of thing that makes people want to do early intervention, early detection,

408
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:19,339
because I want to be able to potentially move somebody from maybe is here on this solid gray line to this sort of great line right there,

409
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:25,050
very close here. But maybe they're trying to figure out what are the things that are making these two people.

410
00:45:25,070 --> 00:45:31,040
These are groups of kids who have a similar intercept. That is, they're starting at a similar place, but they end in a different place.

411
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:33,700
And this is particularly true here in this group they call the bloomers. Right.

412
00:45:33,710 --> 00:45:39,890
So you see this group starting very low in social functioning for by, again, adolescence.

413
00:45:39,890 --> 00:45:47,330
They're doing much better. So but then you also have this group that starts low at three and is still low at 40.

414
00:45:47,570 --> 00:45:55,310
Right. So it's important to understand there is a lot of heterogeneity among the kids who have autism in terms of how this can be.

415
00:45:55,420 --> 00:46:00,530
This is not social. This is communication. Communication trajectories, this is social.

416
00:46:01,250 --> 00:46:07,310
So, again, you see some kids that are very, very low and they're going to stay they stay low even as they get older.

417
00:46:07,970 --> 00:46:09,320
But then you have this again, this,

418
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:14,000
this group and this the key is like work with we figure out what happened with this group and give it to everybody.

419
00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:21,889
Right. That is having very poor social at the beginning, a low functioning social and is doing much better at the at the end.

420
00:46:21,890 --> 00:46:26,450
So we see a lot of variation here, a lot less variation in the repetitive behavior.

421
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:31,310
So the last video I showed you of the kid doing the self-injurious behavior, you know, he would be here.

422
00:46:31,610 --> 00:46:32,660
Right? So this is a kid.

423
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:40,530
I mean, I guess I don't know what he was like as a child, but that the notion that these are much stickier, these kind of repetitive behavior things.

424
00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:45,700
So some kids do these kind of repetitive behaviors and some kids don't seem to do it.

425
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:52,040
So it's less disruptive. They do it. They're able to do it in a setting and then not do it in other settings.

426
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:57,950
And so they're able to see it's like the when stressed, daily usual that that kind of idea.

427
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:07,370
So there is heterogeneity as kids develop not just heterogeneity at the point of diagnosis, but there's heterogeneity as kids develop.

428
00:47:08,650 --> 00:47:13,380
Okay. So now I'm going to talk about the Wakefield question about autism symptoms.

429
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:18,880
Basic analogy I've given you. All right.

430
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:29,020
So if you go to The Lancet and you go to 1998, your publication, and you go to I don't ever remember what the volume this was.

431
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:32,590
This is exactly what you will see. So this is the way.

432
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:41,530
This is the infamous Wakefield paper that kind of sets off what you will learn about in the reading next next when you do them next week.

433
00:47:41,710 --> 00:47:47,530
So I'm going to give you the high points here, but the details of the story are represented in one of the required readings.

434
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:53,739
And so this is the paper that purports or at least is presented in the public

435
00:47:53,740 --> 00:48:01,000
media as identifying a relationship between the MMR vaccine and autism diagnosis.

436
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:10,330
So now, you know, I'm a scientist, so it's going to people in mind.

437
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:15,550
I'm just going to read, just start out this part for you guys.

438
00:48:16,630 --> 00:48:27,280
And you just tell me to stop when you've heard something that maybe makes you concerned about the rigor and quality of this lancet,

439
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:32,010
which, again, the leading journal of the British Medical Association like this is their.

440
00:48:36,790 --> 00:48:49,180
Okay. We investigated a consecutive series of children with chronic internal colitis that's GI problems and regressive developmental disorder methods.

441
00:48:49,930 --> 00:48:54,819
12 children mean age, six years. Oh, you're not okay with me?

442
00:48:54,820 --> 00:48:57,820
Still going. Okay, that's fine. All right. But not the novel.

443
00:48:57,820 --> 00:49:02,290
We're curious here. All right. Well, let me, you know, keep an open mind.

444
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:11,950
12 children mean age, six years range, 3 to 10. 11 boys were referred to a pediatric gastroenterology unit with a history of normal development,

445
00:49:11,950 --> 00:49:16,600
followed by lots of acquired skills, including language together with diarrhea and abdominal pain.

446
00:49:17,050 --> 00:49:21,129
Children underwent gastroenterological neurological developmental assessment.

447
00:49:21,130 --> 00:49:24,760
A review of Drummond records a low cost copy biopsy, satellite MRI, EEG,

448
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:28,690
lumbar puncture done under sedation barium follow through radiography was done

449
00:49:28,690 --> 00:49:32,470
where possible biochemical hematological and immunological profiles for example.

450
00:49:33,250 --> 00:49:42,810
What was that? And again? Oh. I bet the number of variables is on the order of hundreds, if not thousands.

451
00:49:42,830 --> 00:49:46,110
But let's keep them in effect.

452
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:53,810
Findings. Onset of behavior problems was associated by the parents with measles,

453
00:49:53,810 --> 00:50:00,260
mumps and rubella vaccination in eight of the 12 children with measles infection in one child.

454
00:50:00,590 --> 00:50:05,830
And otitis media. Where am I pre-match? What is that? Oh, come on, you.

455
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:11,410
Otitis media. What's your guess? It's an ear infection.

456
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:15,580
Okay. And another.

457
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:20,950
You can thank me for that when you take your hand. All 12 children had intestinal abnormalities.

458
00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:25,640
No kidding. They were seen at a pediatric gastroenterology unit.

459
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:30,580
That's why they're there. So you're like, okay.

460
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:37,180
You can't trust these abstracts. Abstracts are so brief.

461
00:50:37,370 --> 00:50:40,810
They had to explain all the details. You had to read the paper.

462
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:50,530
You're right. Thank you for that. So let's look at table two, which has the really helpful description title of neuropsychiatric diagnosis.

463
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:54,489
All right. So first of all, you can see all 12 children enumerated.

464
00:50:54,490 --> 00:50:59,260
That's helpful. You know, we've only got a sample size of 12. It's really reassuring.

465
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:06,400
That question marks appear next to 12.

466
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:09,760
I'm not making this [INAUDIBLE] up the table.

467
00:51:10,690 --> 00:51:17,800
Okay. So here's the question marks, you know, and there's some stuff, you know, it's also nice.

468
00:51:17,810 --> 00:51:24,820
There's some, you know, kind of yeah, this is and then you can see like again, exposure, exposure.

469
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:31,209
Now it's exposure identified by parents or doctor, including it is like nine.

470
00:51:31,210 --> 00:51:39,810
I don't know what that means, you know, so. Grace.

471
00:51:42,510 --> 00:51:46,600
I'm not ready to go there. So you may know that this paper was retracted, right?

472
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:50,760
Eventually. Hey, what's my.

473
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:58,500
Give me a number that you think is the number you met a number of years in between when this paper was published and when it was retracted.

474
00:51:59,770 --> 00:52:03,820
Yeah. Why don't you hire a lower?

475
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:12,120
So we're. We're 12, 12 years. And so I don't help Beyonce anyone.

476
00:52:12,230 --> 00:52:18,780
923. So, okay, so this is pretty much.

477
00:52:24,390 --> 00:52:29,280
While that paper might have had some properties. Jeff, these things they did.

478
00:52:30,270 --> 00:52:42,479
So many vaccines, so many. So this I want to show you now the relationship between the number of kids getting MMR

479
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:47,580
vaccines in California and the number of children diagnosed with autism during that time.

480
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:52,500
You can clearly see a very strong relationship between this vaccination right now.

481
00:52:52,590 --> 00:53:00,890
There's nothing there's nothing like. It's you know, you just told me that we don't have good data in America.

482
00:53:00,930 --> 00:53:04,040
You know, these are all Medicaid. Come on. Well, let's go to Denmark.

483
00:53:04,050 --> 00:53:10,280
So now this is a sample of a half a million children born in Denmark.

484
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:14,179
So Denmark has a giant medical system. You know, everything's linked, right?

485
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:24,110
So what I'm looking at here is these kids with autism disorder or other autism spectrum disorder, this is whether they got the MMR vaccine.

486
00:53:24,710 --> 00:53:30,800
This relative risk is 0.92. What does that mean? It was protective.

487
00:53:31,730 --> 00:53:35,630
But is the case now, is that statistically significant? That confidence man includes one.

488
00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:41,750
Right. But that fact is in the protective direction, not the risk direction.

489
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:49,520
Okay. In America.

490
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:53,570
Also, it's not the vaccine. It's the stuff that's in the vaccine.

491
00:53:53,630 --> 00:53:57,890
It's the fine, Mirasol. There's mercury. There's poisons in these vaccines.

492
00:53:58,220 --> 00:54:05,780
You're right. There is stuff in vaccines. Well, this is a study of 256 kids with asthma and 752 controls.

493
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:13,040
This is a large managed care organization. And what we're looking at is whether those kids who got diagnosed or got a vaccine

494
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:17,960
that had thimerosal in it and they're like kind of getting an autism diagnosis.

495
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:25,009
Again, the Y axis here is the relative risk. Anything below one indicates the kids who got the vaccine with thimerosal were less likely

496
00:54:25,010 --> 00:54:28,730
to have a diagnosis of autism than the kids who got the vaccine without any result.

497
00:54:29,030 --> 00:54:32,480
What do you see? A whole lot of nothing.

498
00:54:32,810 --> 00:54:38,750
And also, if there is anything, it's in the protective relationship right now.

499
00:54:40,130 --> 00:54:42,950
But that's just one vaccine.

500
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:50,570
As I said earlier, we have so many vaccines, kids, chicken pox, so many things, and they've all got all these additional errors.

501
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:55,309
Okay. So now we're back in Denmark. It's a different study of about a half million kids.

502
00:54:55,310 --> 00:55:00,320
And now the question is, how many doses of vaccine did you get with thimerosal?

503
00:55:00,350 --> 00:55:04,550
Right. And so here we have yet none. That's the that's the reference group.

504
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:08,360
This is if you got 1.99, this is if you got 2.71.

505
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:14,510
This is if you go to 3.96. This is the trend for an increase, which is .98.

506
00:55:14,630 --> 00:55:18,230
Remember, one means no effect, no relationship.

507
00:55:19,250 --> 00:55:23,180
What do you what do you know about large sample sizes?

508
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:33,070
Does that increase the power to detect an effect or decrease the power to detect an effect that increases the more you know, the more you know.

509
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:36,820
That's how math works. Okay, so.

510
00:55:40,930 --> 00:55:44,430
And this is from the Gerber article that you're going to read.

511
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:50,660
Sometimes things happen. Yeah. Yeah.

512
00:55:52,200 --> 00:56:00,750
There's a causal relationship. And so here, it's like because of this, it's like.

513
00:56:04,650 --> 00:56:09,230
You know, there's 50,000 births every month in Britain.

514
00:56:10,390 --> 00:56:15,210
And you that 50,000 kids get the MMR vaccine every every month.

515
00:56:15,930 --> 00:56:19,470
And so coincidental associations were inevitable.

516
00:56:20,070 --> 00:56:26,760
Just given the probability of the prevalence of about 1 to 2% of kids approximately every single month,

517
00:56:27,210 --> 00:56:33,990
25 kids are going to get a diagnosis of autism soon after having just just by sheer coincidence.

518
00:56:34,350 --> 00:56:34,700
Right.

519
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:42,750
Like, you know, I mean, probably seeing these, like, you know, party tricks where it's like, how many people in this party have the same birthday?

520
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:47,040
Like this. There's. This is a known probability. Like, it's not. You're not that special snowflake.

521
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:51,670
Right. Like other people were born on the same day you were. So.

522
00:56:54,610 --> 00:56:58,600
So. And now. Sorry, I've got my soapbox in the second.

523
00:56:58,630 --> 00:57:09,140
So in 2020, the irony the irony is that the Lancet, the same outlet that published the Wakefield paper to begin with, publishes has.

524
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:15,739
But. You know, exploitive to publish this kind of thing.

525
00:57:15,740 --> 00:57:18,770
I'm like, oh, like, look at this anti-vaccine. Like, they started it.

526
00:57:19,130 --> 00:57:23,860
They loved it, you know? And now they're sort of like, you know, trying to explain.

527
00:57:24,170 --> 00:57:29,000
Trying to understand where where did this come from? So we've already established that none of you have children.

528
00:57:29,210 --> 00:57:35,480
So what I'd like you to do is repeat after me if I ever have children and vaccinate them on time.

529
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:40,520
I'm against vaccines, not cause autism is not a systemic problem.

530
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:46,640
Okay. So no questions about that.

531
00:57:46,770 --> 00:57:50,570
I'll tell talk about some stuff that does research.

532
00:57:55,090 --> 00:58:00,890
And so. So Wakefield has been has lost his medical license.

533
00:58:01,070 --> 00:58:07,070
He's doing fine, though. He actually like they run like run those like talks on like cruises.

534
00:58:07,070 --> 00:58:10,160
Like he's anti-vaccine explains. I mean, literally.

535
00:58:10,580 --> 00:58:13,190
So. So he's financially doing fine.

536
00:58:13,190 --> 00:58:24,300
But he's, you know, his career as a researcher supports the other people on this paper want ask for it to be retracted.

537
00:58:24,350 --> 00:58:26,990
He was the only one that sort of refused to pull out.

538
00:58:27,980 --> 00:58:36,950
And so that's because part of when a journals retracting a paper, they kind of do a bit of a negotiation with the authors oftentimes in terms of.

539
00:58:37,970 --> 00:58:40,980
Can you issue a correction? Does it need to be retracted or not?

540
00:58:41,010 --> 00:58:45,379
Right. So they'll kind of like try to figure out. And so everyone else was like, no, we want this thing retracted.

541
00:58:45,380 --> 00:58:54,230
And he's kind of still to this day. But again, I was I mean, my my I don't think that out.

542
00:58:54,280 --> 00:59:00,200
But I'll double check. Like, I don't think that the editors of The Lancet lost their jobs over this, which they probably should have.

543
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:07,910
I mean, this article went through peer review. Somebody saw this and said, yes, this is something that should be published if you do see it.

544
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:17,170
They're flagging it as an early report. Right. Which is kind of probably there like a level of scrutiny that they give a little bit less to.

545
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:22,459
But this is I mean, this is part of why because they this this is such a huge outlet like the news.

546
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:29,810
You know, CNN doesn't pay attention to when an article was published in the American Journal of Epidemiology.

547
00:59:30,020 --> 00:59:35,000
Like, nobody's getting there. Nobody's getting like alerts from when newspapers come out and that no news agency,

548
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:39,800
they sure as [INAUDIBLE] are getting alerts when new papers come out in The Lancet or New England Journal or JAMA.

549
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:41,000
That's why we hear about it.

550
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:49,850
The other thing is they went on like a full court media press about this that was kind of distinct from what The Lancet put out.

551
00:59:49,940 --> 01:00:02,010
But but so he was he's, you know. He's financially doing fine in this new world order that he's got to search for.

552
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:07,250
He's not able to use, like, literally. Yeah.

553
01:00:07,570 --> 01:00:12,220
Is that why it took so long to reach out? Because of the attention to it?

554
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:15,400
I don't. I don't know. That's a great question.

555
01:00:16,510 --> 01:00:30,590
I. I want to say no, because this kind of timeframe is actually not that unusual for retractions.

556
01:00:31,010 --> 01:00:36,260
They either if it's either like it was an obvious like coding mistake.

557
01:00:36,260 --> 01:00:42,810
And so somebody sort of issues a correction right away or it's almost like an advocacy effort to get it retracted.

558
01:00:42,830 --> 01:00:49,910
So there's actually a website called Retraction Watch that if you love Twitter wars, like I urge you, spend your life better.

559
01:00:49,940 --> 01:00:54,630
Get off Twitter and have a retraction and watch. Really, really.

560
01:00:55,420 --> 01:00:58,879
Like that's fun and that's fun to watch and stuff kind of get through the ringer.

561
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:02,870
There are people trying to defend their life like fake science oftentimes.

562
01:01:03,650 --> 01:01:12,200
But yeah, I mean, it's, it's, it's I show you this because I think it's helpful on the one hand, like we need, we have.

563
01:01:12,590 --> 01:01:15,670
But the reason we still do peer review is that we don't have a better system.

564
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:17,930
But like peer review is not infallible by any means.

565
01:01:17,930 --> 01:01:23,389
And I say this as somebody who is both an associate editor and a peer review work pretty much every week.

566
01:01:23,390 --> 01:01:26,840
And so what I have to prove this paper. Absolutely not.

567
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:30,020
Right. But like, that's based on like on face. It's a poor study.

568
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:37,189
But do are there plenty of papers that are published in a peer reviewed journal that is simply not true.

569
01:01:37,190 --> 01:01:48,769
Yes. It's not related for like symptoms of autism, especially for like younger children, for assessments for that.

570
01:01:48,770 --> 01:01:54,920
Do they also do assessments for like HD or other disorders at the same time as that sometimes?

571
01:01:56,480 --> 01:02:05,959
Yeah. So if you were to get to like that Kennedy Krieger level of assessment, they would be able to like do differential diagnosis, right?

572
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:12,830
So but it's like ADHD or you would have to old if you thought it was ADHD, you wouldn't be putting them through that.

573
01:02:12,830 --> 01:02:18,530
Right. And so that most kids with ADHD are first kind of identified in school age,

574
01:02:19,370 --> 01:02:23,120
oftentimes because it's also kind of that's when kids are starting to learn how to read or like other things,

575
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:27,049
as opposed to kids having other types of maybe they have dyslexia or something else like that.

576
01:02:27,050 --> 01:02:30,440
That's usually when that kind of first becomes identified.

577
01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:35,090
And it's not that parents don't care about these things, but they aren't trained to notice.

578
01:02:35,090 --> 01:02:40,390
And they also have a much smaller sample size to work with, right? Like teachers have hundreds of kids that they've taught.

579
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:46,280
So they can kind of very much better understanding what the distribution is typically to be able to say,

580
01:02:46,580 --> 01:02:52,130
you know, the kids having a little bit more trouble than other kids at the same age with the same tests.

581
01:02:53,180 --> 01:02:57,559
So I would it would be unheard of to have a two year old get a diagnosis of ADHD.

582
01:02:57,560 --> 01:03:01,670
It's not enough to have it to get a diagnosis of autism. Yeah.

583
01:03:02,260 --> 01:03:09,370
With kids like with other just or like with existing disabilities and other levels of like functional threat.

584
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:19,780
How is autism diagnosed as users? That is a fantastic question that we are going to spend a lot of time with on Monday.

585
01:03:19,900 --> 01:03:25,540
So preview is that one, it's very hard.

586
01:03:25,780 --> 01:03:31,720
And two, historically. So if you back went back and looked at kids who were diagnosed with autism in the 1980s,

587
01:03:32,470 --> 01:03:40,420
you would see a lot more overlap between kids with autism diagnosis and a co-morbid or co-occurring diagnosis of intellectual disability.

588
01:03:41,350 --> 01:03:53,419
Today, those groups look very, very different. So the heart of this is talk about the kind of the ideas about the treat ability

589
01:03:53,420 --> 01:03:56,940
of autism versus the treat ability of something like intellectual disability.

590
01:03:56,960 --> 01:04:03,260
Right. And sort of the different access to different social resources and goods that drive those two conversations.

591
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:10,990
But, I mean, the short answer is that's very, very difficult. If a kid can't verbalize little ones, nobody can verbalize.

592
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:14,300
But even if older ones are taking out verbalize or they're it's difficult.

593
01:04:14,610 --> 01:04:20,830
It's very different part. And it also doesn't mean it's just autism, right?

594
01:04:20,970 --> 01:04:31,660
Kids can have multiple things going on. You know, and most of our interventions for kids with autism are focused on self control, social behavior.

595
01:04:31,660 --> 01:04:37,000
Right. They're not like specific to autism, kind of more generally, like let's help you,

596
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:41,520
you know, sort of when you're when you're playing a game and just lose,

597
01:04:41,530 --> 01:04:47,559
like how do we manage that, you know, or you want to do something and you actually have to change plans, like how do we manage that?

598
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:53,710
So those are the types of interventions that kids are having that's helpful for whether that kid's got autism or not.

599
01:04:53,740 --> 01:05:01,120
Right? Like most kids are not like totally okay with like losing games, you know, like most kids have some problems.

600
01:05:06,490 --> 01:05:12,400
Okay. All right. So all right. So let me tell you a few things that that are related to autism.

601
01:05:12,820 --> 01:05:22,510
Thank you. So just like with schizophrenia, there is a strong familial aggregation of autism spectrum disorder.

602
01:05:22,510 --> 01:05:31,299
That is, if you have a full or full sibling or a twin that has autism, you are also have a higher risk of developing autism.

603
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:35,950
I'll show you this data on this in a second. People have also looked at some gestational characteristics.

604
01:05:35,950 --> 01:05:42,879
I'm not going to show you data on this today, but some of these have held up with better studies.

605
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:47,380
Some of them have not. I'm going to show you some data on birth order and birth spacing,

606
01:05:47,650 --> 01:05:51,850
and then we'll end with a little bit of parental age that we're going to return to next week.

607
01:05:52,510 --> 01:05:55,180
So this is showing you this autism aggregates within families.

608
01:05:55,180 --> 01:06:00,340
So this is the Y axis is the probability that you get an autism diagnosis at this particular age.

609
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:04,810
So you can see basically nobody's getting an autism until about age three or four.

610
01:06:05,140 --> 01:06:10,750
But given that you have an autism, given that you have a full sibling that has an autism diagnosis, age ten,

611
01:06:11,740 --> 01:06:15,729
the probability that you're going to get an autism diagnosis is about 5%,

612
01:06:15,730 --> 01:06:19,710
which is higher, much higher than if your sibling did not have an autism diagnosis.

613
01:06:19,750 --> 01:06:26,440
This is just a way to illustrate the aggregation of autism within families.

614
01:06:26,470 --> 01:06:34,520
Now, of course, you might say, well, if I'm a clinician and I know that your sibling has a C and then you start interest,

615
01:06:34,750 --> 01:06:37,989
aren't I going to be preferentially like choosing that diagnosis?

616
01:06:37,990 --> 01:06:42,639
I'm not sure that's true, but they're diagnosing something, right?

617
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:47,470
So this there is this symptom of there's a cluster of symptoms that that is happening within families.

618
01:06:48,220 --> 01:06:58,240
This is not showing you the heritability of autism so yeah twin studies estimate the this you're sorry is the eight M.D. is 50 to 75%.

619
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:03,100
Again this is very high that's about the same if not a little bit higher than it is for schizophrenia.

620
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:10,510
And a difficult issue that I just kind of flag is that being a twin in and of

621
01:07:10,510 --> 01:07:14,700
itself is associated with risk of obstetric complications and risk of autism.

622
01:07:14,710 --> 01:07:18,430
So kids who have it, if you experience obstetric complications,

623
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:23,970
those things are associated with all sorts of neurodevelopmental problems, including DSD.

624
01:07:23,980 --> 01:07:29,920
So it means that this twin study estimate of heritability, we can't fully trust him.

625
01:07:32,110 --> 01:07:33,759
Another thing that this has been known for many,

626
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:45,640
many years is that kids with autism are significantly more likely to be the first child born in their family or the only child born in their family.

627
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:54,700
So let me show you let me walk you through this. So this is looking at the relative risk of having an autism diagnosis are getting autism diagnosis.

628
01:07:54,940 --> 01:07:58,050
You can see the sample sizes because these are huge studies. Okay.

629
01:07:58,420 --> 01:08:03,190
Thousands of people. If you're this is in both your parents are young.

630
01:08:03,430 --> 01:08:09,610
So young is defined as dad is mom is under 30 are 20 to 34.

631
01:08:09,820 --> 01:08:16,960
And that doesn't. So the probability that you get an autism diagnosis if you're the firstborn and both your parents are younger,

632
01:08:16,970 --> 01:08:23,290
is about 70% higher odds than if you were the third child and they were that old.

633
01:08:24,070 --> 01:08:27,700
This is much stronger if both your parents were older.

634
01:08:27,730 --> 01:08:38,080
So what this means is being the first child of older parents is associated with higher risk of autism relative to being,

635
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:43,000
in this case, the third child of younger parents. Okay.

636
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:48,160
So what what might explain this?

637
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:54,750
So what are. Now.

638
01:08:54,960 --> 01:09:00,310
I mean, Apple stock. So but. So there's there's not a country.

639
01:09:00,570 --> 01:09:04,740
Okay. So another thing I'm going to give you the why we think this is happening.

640
01:09:05,220 --> 01:09:11,910
But another finding is that children who go on to if they were the second born child,

641
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:20,640
children that go on to get an autism diagnosis were more likely to be conceived after a short interpreter going to see Interpol.

642
01:09:20,650 --> 01:09:28,000
So if you ever have children that after the baby's born, the doctor is going to talk to you about getting on birth control.

643
01:09:28,020 --> 01:09:34,889
Why? Because having a short that is like within six months into a pregnancy interval is essentially lots of complications,

644
01:09:34,890 --> 01:09:44,790
both for the woman and for the baby. And so what I'm showing you here is the probability that the second kid got a diagnosis of autism.

645
01:09:44,940 --> 01:09:52,900
So this is the ratio is about two depending as of when were they conceived relative to the first born kid.

646
01:09:52,920 --> 01:10:01,229
Right. And so having a short pregnancy interval is associated with higher likelihood that the second kid is going to be in an autism diagnosis.

647
01:10:01,230 --> 01:10:05,970
And you can see that once we kind of get past after two years, there's no additional benefit of waiting.

648
01:10:07,290 --> 01:10:14,060
So this this this phenomenon that short going to say intervals are associated with risk of autism in the second kit,

649
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:18,809
which we think is potentially related to folic acid.

650
01:10:18,810 --> 01:10:27,630
So folic acid is a supplement that when people are pregnant, they take those it's it's protective for neural tube problems like spina bifida.

651
01:10:28,740 --> 01:10:32,190
And now studies have shown that if there was actually just one that came out the other day,

652
01:10:32,580 --> 01:10:42,209
that low folic acid intake during pregnancy is associated with risk of potentially risk of autism and other mental problems.

653
01:10:42,210 --> 01:10:46,670
And so what is happening here with the short independency interval,

654
01:10:46,680 --> 01:10:53,010
the thought is that the woman's body is not able to build back up that folic acid reserve in that short period of time.

655
01:10:53,370 --> 01:10:59,159
So when you're pregnant, your entire skeletal system turns over like the whole like your body.

656
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:05,610
Just everything. Everything changes. And so that's part of why we think that might be happening.

657
01:11:07,030 --> 01:11:07,839
The other thing, though,

658
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:16,569
in terms of like the birth order finding is people people have come up with this idea of both causal and non causal explanation.

659
01:11:16,570 --> 01:11:25,750
So one of the causal explanations as to why firstborn children might be more likely to develop autism is this idea of the hygiene hypothesis.

660
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:28,979
So this comes from the fact that other disorders,

661
01:11:28,980 --> 01:11:33,520
so being first born is also associated with greater risk of type one diabetes and any topic disorders.

662
01:11:33,580 --> 01:11:39,580
Okay. So these are autoimmune problems. So it's it's suggesting there's something going on with the immune system.

663
01:11:39,940 --> 01:11:44,139
Where else did we learn about the immune system? Yes, that's right.

664
01:11:44,140 --> 01:11:50,050
Schizophrenia. So so the thought is that these first born kids are exposed to fewer infections.

665
01:11:50,350 --> 01:11:57,009
Okay. The reason is because when they're they are often not getting the second born is

666
01:11:57,010 --> 01:11:59,970
getting exposed to everything in the household plus whatever the first one brings up.

667
01:12:00,430 --> 01:12:06,250
So if you're a second born kid, you got all of the illnesses that your older siblings brought home,

668
01:12:06,460 --> 01:12:08,290
plus everything that you were given in the household.

669
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:14,590
But the first born kids, they they don't have they have fewer sort of opportunities or vectors to get sick.

670
01:12:14,860 --> 01:12:18,640
And so that might delay this immunological challenge and that might be a problem.

671
01:12:19,420 --> 01:12:24,370
The other potential causal explanation is exposure to accumulated toxins.

672
01:12:24,370 --> 01:12:33,370
So I mentioned that when you're pregnant, your entire skeletal system turns over what hangs out in your skeletal system lead.

673
01:12:34,060 --> 01:12:41,170
Okay, so led when people talk about lead, there's blood, blood tests, but there's also lead hangs out in your bones, right?

674
01:12:41,200 --> 01:12:48,460
So if you've been exposed to lead, it's in your bones. And so what they've done, they've done these fascinating studies of baby teeth.

675
01:12:49,270 --> 01:12:55,330
So the child's baby to lose them, if this wasn't extracted, they just lose them.

676
01:12:55,600 --> 01:13:02,110
And you can look to see how much toxins were in those babies, because that's a metric of the kids.

677
01:13:02,280 --> 01:13:06,880
So these are formed when a child is in utero. So a lot.

678
01:13:07,030 --> 01:13:16,870
So this could potentially represent the when the woman's skeleton is, you know, kind of turning over again, 100% turnover,

679
01:13:16,870 --> 01:13:26,140
all of your cells get changed and your skeletal system, again, greater exposure to both these in utero and then potentially even through.

680
01:13:28,510 --> 01:13:31,569
But there's also a non causal explanation which is stoppage.

681
01:13:31,570 --> 01:13:40,480
So if you have a child that has a lot of health conditions, you may elect to not have any more children.

682
01:13:41,710 --> 01:13:48,820
Okay. And so this that again, the thought is that once the first child is diagnosed as having SD,

683
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:54,010
they may elect to not have any more children, which will produce a kind of.

684
01:13:54,310 --> 01:13:58,629
Not not not that it caused their birth thought it didn't cause them to get

685
01:13:58,630 --> 01:14:04,090
asd but because they have a d the family chooses not to have other children.

686
01:14:04,450 --> 01:14:07,240
So when they become an only child because of that.

687
01:14:10,240 --> 01:14:17,710
And the last thing I'm going to show you about and then I'm going to let you go is other aspects of parental characteristics,

688
01:14:18,700 --> 01:14:26,019
specifically parental age. So this is showing you that that is probably no surprise to anybody in this room.

689
01:14:26,020 --> 01:14:34,120
But the average age at first birth has increased substantially over the last 30 to 40 years.

690
01:14:34,540 --> 01:14:37,650
So this is what it was in 1970.

691
01:14:37,660 --> 01:14:43,240
So on average, most women have had their first born around their twenties.

692
01:14:43,390 --> 01:14:48,100
Okay. And this is where we are today. Of course, there's a distribution here.

693
01:14:48,100 --> 01:14:51,430
But this is you can see much, many, many years later, that's the average.

694
01:14:52,810 --> 01:15:02,740
And what we know is that older parental age, particularly older fathers age, that is that over age of 40,

695
01:15:03,100 --> 01:15:08,410
is associated with higher relative odds of the offspring having the child having autism.

696
01:15:09,670 --> 01:15:12,940
Okay. So older parents are more likely.

697
01:15:12,940 --> 01:15:20,830
And what is old? Me old means 35 to 35, 35 to 39 for women and only 42 for men.

698
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:27,070
But again, look at the Y axis. This isn't a huge effect, so don't freak out, but just it's important to point that out.

699
01:15:27,970 --> 01:15:30,790
I already showed you this graph when we talked about schizophrenia.

700
01:15:31,030 --> 01:15:41,859
Again, part of why we think this finding that is older fathers remember that sperm are being made constantly and that the machinery to catch,

701
01:15:41,860 --> 01:15:45,910
to know when mutations in sperm maybe kind of get gets less functioning.

702
01:15:46,300 --> 01:15:49,450
And so what we can see is that age father at conception.

703
01:15:49,450 --> 01:15:55,179
Now we're over here at 40 these that the black ones here are indicating kids with autism.

704
01:15:55,180 --> 01:16:00,819
That is this is a de novo mutation that was not present in the somatic cells of the parents or in this case,

705
01:16:00,820 --> 01:16:05,020
the somatic cells of the father, but is present in the offspring, and it was present in sperm.

706
01:16:06,550 --> 01:16:09,700
So there's lots of reasons why this might be happening.

707
01:16:09,730 --> 01:16:16,630
So the first is the causal explanation, which is that older partners make older parents.

708
01:16:16,750 --> 01:16:22,180
All right. So if it takes you a long time to kind of find the person that you want to have children with,

709
01:16:23,290 --> 01:16:27,010
what we might be seeing is just kind of like a sort of meeting of the socially awkward.

710
01:16:27,640 --> 01:16:31,990
Right. So, I mean, this is you see, so this is that's a non causal explanation.

711
01:16:34,510 --> 01:16:38,500
It's also possible that older parents are more likely to have shorter space births.

712
01:16:38,950 --> 01:16:44,800
Why are they more likely to have shorter space work? So why would a woman in her late thirties and more likely to have a short.

713
01:16:46,270 --> 01:16:55,299
Yeah. They like feel like they're late in the game and they just want to have was a fertility is declining like that is a legitimate thing that's

714
01:16:55,300 --> 01:17:02,890
happening and she may be trying to avoid something else she may be trying to avoid a chromosomal disorder which does increase maternal age.

715
01:17:02,890 --> 01:17:07,210
Older maternal age increases the likelihood of some chromosomal disorders.

716
01:17:09,640 --> 01:17:14,440
Older parents are also more likely to use assisted reproductive technology or HRT.

717
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:22,510
This is again part of. And so if there's something in HRT and there's some evidence that some forms of energy are associated with autism,

718
01:17:22,510 --> 01:17:28,480
not all forms that could be a potential causal explanation. And as I just told you, older parents have older germ cells.

719
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:34,749
But the most important thing that work that's relevant for what we're going to talk about next time is

720
01:17:34,750 --> 01:17:40,750
that older parents are more educated and they have higher socioeconomic status relative to your parents.

721
01:17:41,500 --> 01:17:54,520
And this characteristic is going to be very important when we try to understand why is it that there are clusters of autism births in the Bay Area,

722
01:17:55,480 --> 01:18:02,260
which, as you can see here, is one of the most highly educated parts of the nation, and Cambridge, Massachusetts,

723
01:18:02,260 --> 01:18:06,250
which is another very, very highly educated part of the United States.

724
01:18:07,090 --> 01:18:12,440
So I will leave you with this and come back on Monday to find out meetings out there.

725
01:18:14,110 --> 01:18:14,410
Right.
