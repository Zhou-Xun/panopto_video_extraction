1
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:12,590
Oh. Did you notice difference?

2
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:17,750
I did notice. They're both unsinkable batteries today. And they are actually.

3
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:22,070
Oh, yeah? Why not? Well, one of the.

4
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:26,450
One of them from last time and then one of them for this one we actually used to cover in class.

5
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:31,670
So the one you're going to cover, we used to cover in class. So I was very excited that you're going to cover.

6
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:40,130
It feels very efficient. Oops.

7
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:57,330
Of mid-semester brain fog also. Okay, I guess I can do a slide show and see if I can open it up.

8
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:04,430
Good. I have.

9
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:11,910
Haven't. Oh, no.

10
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,690
Okay. Once I got. It's going to make me say that like eight times again.

11
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:57,790
Yes. That should work either one.

12
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:10,050
Here you go. But it's.

13
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:20,510
Okay. So there's no slide show mode on this one, i. All right.

14
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:29,700
Hi, everybody. My name is Katie Wondolowski. I'm going to tell you about a study conducted with my colleagues where we did sequential

15
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:36,480
neuro imaging of the fetus and newborn to evaluate in utero Zika virus exposure.

16
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:42,899
So just a little bit of background on Zika virus. This is a really cool image.

17
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:47,850
I think the top shows the mature form of the virus, the bottom shows the immature form.

18
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:56,310
And just to let you know, you might see Zika condensed as Zika, which is just short for Zika virus.

19
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:00,120
So if you hear me use both terms, they're just used interchangeably here.

20
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,020
Zika virus belongs to the Flavivirus genus.

21
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:14,190
It is a single, stranded, positive sense RNA virus that has an envelope, and it's primarily transmitted through mosquitoes as the vectors.

22
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:18,630
And the two main mosquitoes that do that are AIDS aegypti and AIDS albopictus.

23
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:31,050
Little bit more background for our article. So a neurologic phenotype of Zika emerged in late 2015.

24
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,209
Sorry. And in South and Central America.

25
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:43,260
And the Caribbean. And this neurologic phenotype, you see a lot of like brain deformities in infants.

26
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:50,160
So over here on the right, you see microcephaly. That's what it looks like, which is when the baby's head is smaller than normal.

27
00:03:51,000 --> 00:04:00,210
So this can usually be found by imaging. So when you image babies that are still in the womb, you can usually see these deformities.

28
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:09,210
And past studies have shown that the abnormalities will appear by about 20 weeks gestation.

29
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:15,580
So the purpose of this study,

30
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:24,490
we really wanted to evaluate the different brain structure of fetuses and infants that were exposed in utero to maternal Zika virus.

31
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:27,790
And we did this using both ultrasound and MRI.

32
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:33,040
The secondary objective was to try and determine the length of the arrhythmia.

33
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,210
So how long the virus was in the blood during pregnancy in the mother,

34
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:42,730
and whether the length of urine that is associated with brain or abnormalities of the fetus.

35
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:50,950
And we hypothesized that fetal abnormalities could be detected earlier in MRI than ultrasound

36
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:55,930
and that there would be an association between Zika infection and these abnormalities.

37
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:07,270
So this was a prospective cohort study. We enrolled 82 pregnant women from both Washington, D.C. and Columbia.

38
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:14,980
I think it's important to note that only two women were enrolled from Washington, D.C., and those were both travel related cases.

39
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:21,250
And all of these participants were identified through direct community recruitment and physician referral.

40
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:29,100
And then from there, we collected clinical data like timing of symptoms, what symptoms they had, as well as blood samples.

41
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:33,170
The inclusion criteria was produced.

42
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:41,239
A bar on the women just had to be pregnant and they had to have clinical symptoms of Zika with or without a positive test.

43
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:47,510
So a positive Zika test was not required for our inclusion exclusion criteria.

44
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:53,600
We did not include women who were asymptomatic even if they did have a positive test.

45
00:05:54,050 --> 00:06:00,680
Although it is important to note we did include one woman who was asymptomatic because she had a

46
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:06,440
severely affected fetus and then women were also excluded if they couldn't go through an MRI.

47
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:14,610
So far methods. We did both fetal imaging and postnatal imaging.

48
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:23,400
So before birth and after birth for our fetal imaging, we did at least one MRI and ultrasound during the second and or third trimesters,

49
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:28,320
and we just looked for different structural abnormalities like those listed there.

50
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:38,309
And then we measured parts of the brain from these images and compared it to age expected norms and then the fetal head circumference C scores were

51
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:44,250
calculated and then those were assessed by comparing them to a normal gestational

52
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:49,979
age and then also assessed with a paired T test for postnatal imaging.

53
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:58,260
After the baby was born, they had another MRI and ultrasound and we again measured head circumference and calculated the Z score.

54
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:03,180
But important to know it was not performed if the infant when fall asleep naturally.

55
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:10,250
So here are some of our results. And this is our table one right here.

56
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:15,710
So it's important to note all except one mother had clinical evidence for Zika,

57
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:20,060
and not all except one was the one that was asymptomatic that we included.

58
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:32,690
And 52 participants tested positive. However, we only tested the first 52 participants, so there were 75 out of 80 live born infants born at term.

59
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:43,610
Two of the fetuses died before birth. One was terminated at gestation 23 weeks because of severe abnormalities in the brain.

60
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:52,700
And then the other fetus was spontaneously aborted close to term and that one was not included in our analysis just because it had a normal,

61
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:56,450
you know, imaging. So we didn't see any abnormalities.

62
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:04,310
And then there was one infant, unfortunately, that died three days after birth, and that one did have severe defects.

63
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,990
And then there was also one infant that required neurosurgical intervention.

64
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:17,570
So these are the three cases that were included in our analysis.

65
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:23,059
If you remember, we didn't include the one that was spontaneously aborted because it had normal imaging.

66
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:30,650
So we included the infant that had surgery, the infant that passed away at gestation 23 weeks,

67
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:35,480
and then also the infant that passed away three days after birth.

68
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:43,879
So only those three fetuses had brain abnormalities that we believe are consistent with Zika infection and the means.

69
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:47,630
The score of the first ultrasound was 0.27.

70
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,340
But then you see the means. You score a decrease to negative point ten.

71
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:56,090
Among the 44 fetuses with this ultrasound.

72
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:08,700
And this is just an image showing like some of the images that we saw when we were doing prenatal imaging.

73
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,719
You can see I know like we don't know much about that,

74
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:20,220
but you can see that it's kind of there's a protrusion over here at the back of the head, an image, a image.

75
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:23,460
B, you can kind of see there's a lack of cerebrospinal fluid.

76
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:30,480
And then again over here, you see a protrusion in the back of the head and another deformation could carry to.

77
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:41,670
So some more on our post-natal imaging. So after birth, the head circumference C score at birth was 0.07,

78
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:47,850
which was pretty normal compared to H standards, except in the one infant who had to have surgery.

79
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:52,860
And all of the infants with postnatal imaging had normal fetal results.

80
00:09:53,160 --> 00:10:00,930
But keep in mind, we did not image the three babies that we are including in our study here because one died at 23 weeks.

81
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:05,459
If you recall, one had surgery and one died three days after birth.

82
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,650
So they did not have postnatal imaging.

83
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:21,570
Only 23 out of 61 infants with postnatal imaging had findings and 13% of infants had abnormal MRI's and 37% had abnormal ultrasounds.

84
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:27,930
But none of the abnormalities that we saw we expect are associated with Zika.

85
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:32,460
They were all pretty typical to see the newborn babies.

86
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:41,900
So if you remember, we also wanted to see if there was a correlation between premia and the brain abnormalities.

87
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:52,550
Two out of three of the severe cases we included had negative PCR tests nine and 12 weeks after symptom onset.

88
00:10:52,940 --> 00:11:00,950
However, it's important to know that usually the PCR test is more accurate, really close to when you have symptom onset.

89
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:05,900
So since it was so far, it's typical that all the cases were in test positive.

90
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:14,180
Only one in 66 women had an infant brain abnormalities when they were if they had symptoms during the first trimester.

91
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,680
So since we expected more infants to have brain abnormalities,

92
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:23,510
if the mother was symptomatic in the first trimester, this kind of goes against our hypothesis.

93
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:26,210
The mother of one case was asymptomatic.

94
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:38,720
All three fetuses that we are including had positive or equivocal maternal Zika AGM and IgG, but then they had negative tests after birth.

95
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:43,460
So it was present in utero, but not they did not test positive after birth.

96
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:54,230
And only one of the fetuses was able to detect the Zika genome by PCR for a longer than three weeks after the start of the maternal symptoms.

97
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:08,700
So there are quite a few limitations to our study. One major one, I think, is that laboratory confirmation was not required for infection.

98
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:15,320
And if you know anything about Zika, the symptoms are pretty similar to many other diseases.

99
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:20,460
You know, you got like fever, tiredness, some kinds of rash, that kind of thing.

100
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:26,430
So I think that was a big limitation that we also only tested the first 52 participants.

101
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,290
And since all of those tested positive, we start testing it after that.

102
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:39,570
Again, only one participant out of all of them, 82, had a positive PCR test.

103
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:41,880
And that is the most specific method.

104
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:50,280
However, again, the PCR test loses specificity longer after symptoms start and we do not test within the recommended amount.

105
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:58,020
We also did not conduct ECG and testing during the recommended window, so that could be a potential limitation.

106
00:12:58,410 --> 00:12:59,309
And then again,

107
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:06,570
some infants did not have postnatal imaging because they moved during that MRI or they couldn't fall asleep or there was loss of follow up.

108
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,240
All right. So some conclusions.

109
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:20,180
As far as we know, this was the first longitudinal study using such a type of serial brain imaging for Zika exposed infants.

110
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:26,150
96% of fetuses had normal imaging, which we expected there would be more.

111
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:34,220
We definitely anticipated a higher rate of abnormalities, especially if the mother was symptomatic during the first trimester.

112
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:42,350
But we don't really see that most of the brain abnormalities are seen after birth were not specific to Zika infection.

113
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:49,820
And there was, as far as we can tell, no association between fetal brain abnormalities and maternal to women.

114
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:55,880
Here. My references. Any questions?

115
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:08,350
Yes. So I was just curious a moment. She said that you didn't have a lab confirmed.

116
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:15,250
So how did you. Other than just like, symptoms, how did you know or.

117
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:19,520
Like it wasn't required, but it was still have lived through them.

118
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:23,970
So 52 out of 82 tested positive.

119
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:31,350
I believe what they did was after they tested the first 52, they saw they were all positive and stopped testing.

120
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:41,550
So, yes, that is a major limitation and that the only way the rest of those women were considered cases was by their symptoms.

121
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:48,630
So, yeah, this is that because testing is expensive, it's like they don't want you testing out just because it was, like, tedious.

122
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:53,520
That's a really good question. They did it mention it in the paper.

123
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:57,060
Exactly why? So I'll have to get back to you like it, but good question.

124
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:05,290
I wonder, too, to what degree were they doing? And I didn't think they were, but they were doing research,

125
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:09,980
testing versus where they were lying and other testing programs, because you could see a situation where.

126
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:16,350
In the testing for whatever sort of overarching clinical surveillance program is happening because of that.

127
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:21,620
Yeah. And I believe like samples were sent to the CDC to be tested.

128
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:27,450
So I think and they did blood samples of it because they said the PCRs, they all were negative.

129
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:30,510
So they did blood samples and sent them to the CDC.

130
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:35,140
So I kind of think it could be both tedious and expensive to do that.

131
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:40,200
So I wonder if maybe if somebody. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

132
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:49,860
Any other questions? So these are so these babies are getting you know,

133
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:54,480
these babies that are identified as having babies and getting exposed are getting

134
00:15:54,660 --> 00:16:02,790
way more in depth testing for brain abnormalities than you would normally do.

135
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:07,250
Yeah, exactly. What degree do you think we're beginning to pick up?

136
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:12,920
Just a larger range of brain abnormalities that are there in, you know,

137
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:17,310
the larger population of unexposed infants that are starting to show up in these labs.

138
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,890
Yeah, that's a really good question.

139
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:28,710
I mean, I do know that the severe brain abnormalities they saw were very consistent with what we've seen with Zika in the past.

140
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:34,440
So I think that's why we thought those were associated with Zika.

141
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:38,730
I think you're entirely right in that they normally don't do this type of imaging.

142
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:46,230
Usually, you know, babies will have a couple of ultrasounds during pregnancy, but nothing more than that.

143
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:53,250
So I do think that that could be a part of it in that they're just expanding testing.

144
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,689
But I mean, this was done this was published in 2018.

145
00:16:57,690 --> 00:17:02,219
And that was the first the first study that used this kind of serial imaging.

146
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:08,830
So I think it would be interesting to see how since then, I mean, that's it's been four years now since then.

147
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:12,100
We've started to use it more in the field. For sure.

148
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:15,329
I hope that answers your question. We can talk more about it.

149
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:21,360
I think it's certainly a good time for any other questions.

150
00:17:22,590 --> 00:18:09,010
Thank you very much. Okay.

151
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:16,670
So today I'll be talking about the enhancement of Zika virus pathogenesis by preexisting anti flavivirus immunity.

152
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:19,940
So a little introduction.

153
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:29,900
So Zika virus, as you kind of explained, as a mosquito transmitted flavivirus it was discovered in 1947, but remained relatively obscure,

154
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:38,420
obscure until 2015, when the large outbreak in Brazil occurred spreading in the south and Central American countries and some parts of the US.

155
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,950
It's associated with microcephaly and other neurological diseases.

156
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:50,690
And then it's also been shown that West Nile virus and dengue virus circulate with Zika virus in many regions.

157
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:56,210
So we wanted to see if that explained some of the Zika virus prevalence.

158
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,469
So we wanted to look at antibody dependent enhancement.

159
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:05,210
So that occurs when antibodies can enhance virus entry and replication in cells.

160
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:09,140
It's been correlated with the different dengue serotypes.

161
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:14,659
We know that Zika virus is followed genetically similar to dengue.

162
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:17,660
So we wanted to see if this was the case for Zika virus as well.

163
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:23,090
So antibody dependent enhancement is primarily mediated through the engagement of

164
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:29,060
antibodies to cell surface FC gamma receptors and through the complement system.

165
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:35,510
We're mainly going to look at the engagement of IGG antibodies to cell surface FC gamma receptors.

166
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:45,590
So the methods we used were we first compared convalescent plasma from 141 positive dengue fever,

167
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:53,690
infected blood donors and 146 IgG positive West Nile Virus infected blood donors from Puerto Rico and the USA.

168
00:19:54,680 --> 00:20:02,270
And we compare that with random blood donor controls. To examine the crossover cross-reactivity of the antibodies in vitro,

169
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:10,610
we then used an FC gamma receptor bearing human derived k562 cells infected with the West Nile virus

170
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:17,210
and dengue virus convalescent plasma to evaluate the enhancement of the Zika virus infection in vitro.

171
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:21,740
We then wanted to also look at the Zika virus enhancement in vivo.

172
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:31,700
So we used that to now see 57 black six mice which were given either controlled dengue virus or West Nile virus, immune plasma.

173
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:36,379
And then they were infected 2 hours later with Zika virus strain PRV,

174
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:43,850
ABC 59 to determine the survival of the mice if they exhibited a weight loss in any clinical symptom development,

175
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:51,290
mainly neuron neurological symptom development. We lastly measured viral levels in the blood of the mice with PCR,

176
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:58,070
and we looked at several organs known to be associated with the Zika virus infection and sexual transmission by plaque

177
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:07,040
assays to characterize Zika virus replication related to the preexisting antibodies of the dengue virus in West Nile virus.

178
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,850
So to look at the cross reactivity of the West Nile and then the virus antibodies,

179
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:23,760
we looked at the binding of those antibodies to the Zika e protein, which is in the envelope of the Zika virus.

180
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:35,040
So we saw that the binding of the DNA dengue virus in West Nile virus antibodies were significantly higher compared to the control plasma.

181
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:47,370
We also looked at the antibody dependent enhancement and we found that there was a increase in the ADI of the dengue virus in West Nile virus,

182
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:57,749
immune plasma compared to the control plasma. We then plotted that Zika virus e protein binding versus the antibody dependent

183
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:02,190
enhancement of Zika virus and found that there is a strong association between the two.

184
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:11,670
So we know that the preexisting antibodies to dengue virus in the West Nile virus can enhance the Zika virus infection in vitro.

185
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:20,810
We then wanted to look at the enhancement of Zika virus infection via IGG engagement of the FC gamma receptors.

186
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:32,750
So we used the control of dengue virus in West Nile Plasma that we infected the k562 cells with k562 cells or a

187
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:39,980
common cell line to test antibody dependent enhancement and because they exhibit these FC Gamma to a receptors.

188
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:48,110
So we first compared cells with the plasma compared to cells that just got the purified IgG antibodies.

189
00:22:48,710 --> 00:23:00,760
And we saw similar Zika virus enhancement in both indicating that IGG is the primary component in the plasma that can cause this A-D.

190
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:10,250
We then compared the plasma with plasma that was depleted with I2, which further shows that the IgG is important in this ETI.

191
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:21,050
We then looked at the IgG purified antibodies and compare that with an FC gamma receptor inhibitor,

192
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:26,120
and we found that the cells with this inhibitor showed no enhancement.

193
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:34,160
Um, which indicates that the IGG is binding to this FC of sigma ah to a receptor causing this 80.

194
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:41,570
We also looked at the effects of two antibodies, so A.C.T. 32 and A.C.T. 16.

195
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:50,540
So anti anti CD 32 is known to block the binding of IGG to the FC to a receptor.

196
00:23:50,930 --> 00:24:00,110
And so we saw in this case that there was no enhancement when we had this antibody present showing that the IGG does bind to

197
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:10,980
this receptor to cause the 80 E versus when we tested the anti CD 16 antibody that blocks the binding of IGG to FC Gamma three,

198
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:15,020
which is a receptor that's not actually present on the K 516 cells.

199
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:18,740
So we saw that there is still enhancement in those cells.

200
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:31,940
Lastly, we looked at the effects of the ace enzyme which blocks the it actually removes the and linked GLYCANS and the FC domain of the IgG antibody,

201
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,490
which is necessary for engagement with the receptor.

202
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:39,590
So in this case, in those cells, we saw reduced enhancement.

203
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:45,800
So those were all the in vitro studies we did. We did next.

204
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:52,360
Wanted to see if enhancement of Zika virus was by a convalescent dengue virus in West Nile virus.

205
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:55,900
Plasma. Also, health can happen in vivo.

206
00:24:56,830 --> 00:25:05,320
So we infected mice with convalescent plasma of dengue, a West Nile and or a control plasma.

207
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:11,920
And compare that with we also used PBS as a control and we saw that the survival

208
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:16,690
of these mice was significantly reduced in the dengue and West Nile virus,

209
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:18,970
mice compared to the control mice.

210
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:30,070
And we also saw they had reduced they had more weight loss, especially eight days post-infection compared to the control mice.

211
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:38,470
And we also saw that they had a higher average neurological score, so they exhibited more neurological symptoms compared to the control mice.

212
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:50,890
We then wanted to see if these mice exhibited fever, fevers, a symptom of Zika virus infection, as well as dengue and West Nile virus infection.

213
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:57,600
So we wanted to see if these mice exhibited fever after giving the dengue virus or West Nile plasma.

214
00:25:57,610 --> 00:26:03,370
And we did see after three days post-infection, they did actually exhibit a fever.

215
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:13,750
So then lastly, we wanted to see in vivo if the antibody dependent enhancement correlates with amplified Zika virus replication.

216
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:23,890
So we use PCR to look at the viremia in the blood and we saw that the dengue in West Nile virus was increased.

217
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:30,550
There increased very Zika virus very much in the blood compared to the controls.

218
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:37,090
We also looked at the viral load in the spinal cord and testes and saw that the there is

219
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:43,480
increased viral load in the dengue in West Nile plasma mice compared to the control mice.

220
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:50,980
This was further confirmed with the with the staining, the immunological staining.

221
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:57,580
You can see increased staining in the dengue virus in West Nile virus, mice compared to the control mice.

222
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:03,100
We have been tested the viral load in the brain, ovary and eyes,

223
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:09,970
but we didn't see any significant change in the dengue virus, in West Nile virus, in mice compared to the control mice.

224
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:16,929
Some limitations of our study is that other studies looking at the effect of dengue virus,

225
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:21,220
monoclonal antibodies and enhancement of Zika virus in vivo found no enhancement.

226
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:26,770
So this could be due to differences in mouse models used or the concentrations of antibodies tested.

227
00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:34,330
So we tested our mice were given 20 microliters of the West Nile virus or the dengue virus.

228
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:42,190
We also tested two microliters in 200 microliters, and we found that at the lower concentrations Adi was present,

229
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:46,720
but at the higher 200 microliter concentrations it was actually protective.

230
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:51,190
There is no ADI enhancement, so that could lead to different results.

231
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:58,840
It's not clear of Zika virus strains from different lineages or geographic locations induce 82 different extents.

232
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:04,810
So we only tested one strain of Zika virus. It'd be important to test different strains as well.

233
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:12,520
And then we use polyclonal plasma for the individual studies instead of monoclonal antibodies, which may have affected the outcome.

234
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:19,809
So some of our conclusions are that naturally occurring polyclonal antibodies against West Nile virus

235
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:26,380
and dengue virus or cross-reactivity Zika virus and can enhance Zika virus in vitro and in vivo.

236
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:35,410
We saw that the West Nile elicited antibodies show less serious cross-reactivity enhancement than the dengue virus antibodies,

237
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:40,240
but they still showed an increased cross-reactivity and has been compared to the controls.

238
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:45,760
And then a less aggressive phenotype is observed in mice which received the West Nile

239
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:50,350
virus positive plasma compared to mice which received the dengue virus in plasma.

240
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:57,390
And then the mouse model of the Zika virus infection demonstrated clinically relevant phenotypes to human disease.

241
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:01,150
So we showed that fever released enhanced viral replication.

242
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:07,030
And this was, we think, the first study that connected ad and fever in vivo.

243
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:14,319
And then finally, the implications of our study is that the higher prevalence of dengue virus antibodies in the

244
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:20,920
geographical areas most affected by Zika virus may have contributed to the rapid spread of Zika virus,

245
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:31,959
with increased viremia and clinical signs. The presence of individuals with West Nile virus antibodies in the US raises concerns about ADF Zika virus,

246
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:37,720
where to spread more into the US and if there is big implications on vaccine efforts against dengue,

247
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:40,510
a West Nile virus and other flaviviruses,

248
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:47,650
the cross-reactive antibodies induced by these vaccines may lead to enhanced infection when exposed to Zika virus.

249
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:54,160
And so classrooms should be taken on designing and using flavivirus vaccines and Zika virus infected areas.

250
00:29:56,050 --> 00:30:07,800
Are there any questions? You answered my question.

251
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:18,960
I suppose the implication for vaccine. All right.

252
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:24,250
Thank you very. All right.

253
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:31,460
Well, I'm going to I think before I go into the lecture, I just wanted to review really quickly,

254
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:35,930
because I think this is an important you know, as I mentioned, we used to cover this paper in class.

255
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:42,120
And it's an important extension of what we've seen before with 80 days.

256
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:50,500
And so that this is like the stream of I have more of a comment that I question every lecture from the government.

257
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:57,380
So all right. So we talked about with dengue, I think this is out of batteries.

258
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:05,820
Yeah. Okay, so we're signed with Dan.

259
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,310
We talked about it in the past. I'm not part of this.

260
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:17,910
So we have the hospital here, and the hotel has a receptor, and it also has,

261
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:26,130
like the regular receptor that the virus is recognizing, but it also has this FC receptor that recognizes IGG.

262
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:37,480
So when you've got debt in the debt system we already learned about, you've got the dengue virus.

263
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:48,270
And the deadly virus is both of give it completely a value system where there are no antibodies blocking anything.

264
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:55,770
This can link to the receptor just like you would expect from instead of regular cell receptor and an infection.

265
00:31:56,220 --> 00:32:00,900
And depending on how closely this binds to this receptor, how strong that binding is,

266
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:07,260
is going to determine how much infection happens, how frequently that variant is going to infect the cell.

267
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:15,989
So once you have say you have a full complement of antibodies that have form,

268
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:22,590
so you've had a recent infection or you have a very had a strong antibody protection against dengue virus.

269
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:29,070
You're going to have total coverage using antibodies.

270
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:32,360
You're going to have total blocking of all of the surface protein.

271
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:43,070
So that you don't have any way the donkey cannot attach to this receptor because you've got the antibodies are blocking it.

272
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:50,180
So the problem with 80 is where if you take away just some of these antibodies, but not all of them.

273
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:58,670
What this does is you basically have this surface protein that is now able to link to the surface of the cell,

274
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:08,210
and then this antibody is able to link to the FC receptor, creating this even kind of stickier affinity than you would have normally had.

275
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:17,990
So this kind of this this somewhat antibody states the sort of powerful antibodies that I should say four or five viruses increases,

276
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:23,540
um, increases the infectivity of the variant so you have more cells that get infected.

277
00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:30,680
What this paper is saying is now let's add Zika virus.

278
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:38,540
I mean, the Zika virus, which is going to be also a five year virus, a different virus.

279
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:45,650
Now you've got Zika virus creating Zika virus antibodies like this.

280
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:53,870
The issue is that between the two of these, you can have an effect happen.

281
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:59,360
So I'm going to do it this way. You can actually have the Zika virus.

282
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:07,010
The antibodies do that have the same effect. So Zika virus antibodies can bind to then get a variant,

283
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:14,389
but they don't fight very well because it's not a clean match between viruses and it's cross-reactivity.

284
00:34:14,390 --> 00:34:23,180
A little bit of binding, but there's not a ton. There's not enough binding for a Zika virus antibody to block dengue from creating an infection.

285
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:31,360
But there's just enough antibody to create this secondary attachment that we set into.

286
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:40,190
So you can see where the vaccine development states when you got one vaccine development landscape that's focused on crazy the antibodies.

287
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:46,460
We've got a different vaccine development space that's focused on creating these dengue antibodies.

288
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:55,060
But really, we have to understand how this vaccine and this vaccine are going to going to front cross-reactive immunity.

289
00:34:55,130 --> 00:35:00,030
The other one will be in fact, so. Super fabulous, super happy.

290
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:04,510
Everybody kind of understand this problem. Yeah.

291
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:11,840
So. Yeah. It's this season and this is primarily a firefighters problem.

292
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:18,560
Yeah, it's definitely been looked for in other viruses. Besides, viruses is where we see this most.

293
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:23,960
And part of it is because fibroblasts have very cross-reactive patterns.

294
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:37,130
All right. I feel like in this class, they just tell you about problems.

295
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:44,020
I'm sorry. All right.

296
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:52,040
Let's talk about I've a few slides to finish up on pregnancy and then we're going to see how far

297
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:56,240
I give a herpes virus lecture and then we'll spend a few minutes talking about EBV at the end.

298
00:35:56,810 --> 00:36:05,840
So in this lecture we made it here and this is good because I left off right before getting to it.

299
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:10,880
Just be one in HSV two. So herpes simplex virus one.

300
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:19,670
Herpes simplex virus two. When we talk about maternal to child transmission, remember I told you that when we're talking about the herpes,

301
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:23,920
specifically these herpes viruses and we're talking about congenital transmission,

302
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:27,980
we're really thinking about it like a contact, a mode of transmission.

303
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:36,330
So we're thinking not so much as transfer in utero of the virus, although that does happen very rarely.

304
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:38,390
You can have kind of congenital infection or something like that.

305
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:45,290
But what we're really talking about is most of these infections are occurring in peri,

306
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:54,140
peri partum process as the infant is exposed to virus spread from the general to track as the infant passes through the birth canal.

307
00:36:54,260 --> 00:37:00,140
So the evidence is physically skin to skin contact exposed to virus that way.

308
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:04,670
So, you know,

309
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:13,520
the first kind of thought that comes to mind because they just be one an HSV two causes lesions is the first thing people went after was well let's

310
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:25,490
start if you you know just do a visual scan for lesions during the birth process and see if that is a way to prevent maternal to child transmission.

311
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:33,110
Nearly 80% of women who deliver in HSV infected infants have no known history of genital lesions.

312
00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:44,570
HSV When we go to talk about herpes viruses in a minute, HSV one and two shared, they have patterns of shedding that aren't just limited to lesions.

313
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:53,719
So you can have very focal skin shedding of the virus without necessarily having a visual lesion visually, apparently.

314
00:37:53,720 --> 00:38:04,430
So when that happens. So we wanted to do not shed in breast milk, but when this transmission does happen mostly via the birth canal,

315
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:11,180
it results in skin in mouth disease, some CNS disease, and you may have infants with disseminated disease.

316
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:14,720
So with a number of sexually.

317
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:21,799
And this is what the period and again it's what the Perry parent postpartum looks like

318
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:29,300
and then congenital into partum has a triad a sentence you'll see cutaneous disease,

319
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:32,810
neurologic disease and eye disease, all three of them together.

320
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:37,730
That, however, is a very rare event. Mostly we see the period from postpartum.

321
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:43,790
So there have been you know,

322
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:51,709
this is a study that I like because of thinking about this idea of getting away from the idea of

323
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:59,960
HIV patients being the marker of when congenital infection or when part of infection may happen.

324
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:07,250
So this is a study that looks at risk factors for development of neonatal HSV.

325
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:17,900
They had over 40,000 women who had genital cultures collected at delivery and among the deliveries.

326
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:32,960
So obviously have HSV isolated. That delivery by culture was highly associated with neonatal HSV infections odds ratio of 346 there for you.

327
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:43,790
So and then if you look below it just be isolated from the cervix is really where the risk is coming from.

328
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:45,530
Lesions at delivery.

329
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:56,090
There were actually very few women that had lesions noted at delivery and it was really HSV associated from the cervix where it was identified.

330
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:08,610
Interestingly, if you if you stratify this down to women who were zero negative at the time of delivery,

331
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:13,110
they have the highest rate of rates of births with HSV two.

332
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:17,380
So think about what this means in terms of what we know about antibodies.

333
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:25,230
Right. So they're looking for IGG when they're coming in for delivery and they are IGG negative,

334
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:32,219
which means that they have had their HSV infection that's being detected by culture is a very recent infection.

335
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:40,030
So it's a primary infection and those are the ones that are most likely to transmit through the paper process.

336
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:44,190
And it makes sense because when you have your first primary infection, you tend to have more viral load,

337
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:50,280
you have a more it takes longer for your body to get the virus under control and you get shedding under control.

338
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:54,209
So that intervention target, when we're thinking about, you know,

339
00:40:54,210 --> 00:41:00,510
how how do we intervene with these with this potential for disease is really I think about those

340
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:10,200
people who are seronegative and pregnant and but then at risk of acquiring a new HSV infection,

341
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:14,720
some of this work is focused, for instance, on discordant partners.

342
00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:24,450
So if you have a sero negative parent and the private person, for instance, has a new partnership during pregnancy,

343
00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:30,090
that's when you want to start to think about some of this stuff is that you may have new exposures to HSV,

344
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:42,590
which then could lead to a period of heightened risk. So then the last pregnancy virus I believe into this is parvovirus.

345
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:50,030
Parvovirus. So parvovirus comes from harvest being small and then small, none about viruses.

346
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:54,050
These are DNA viruses, linear, single stranded DNA viruses.

347
00:41:55,310 --> 00:42:01,160
The parvovirus group is very large, includes a lot of animal viruses.

348
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:09,230
Most of these, there's a lot of like subclinical non pathogenic viruses hidden within here.

349
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:13,970
But then there are some viruses that in animals can be very severe.

350
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:20,510
Parvovirus b19 what it looks like in humans. Specifically what it looks like in pregnant.

351
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:27,440
Well, looks like in humans. This is my daughter with parvovirus and it's called Slap C syndrome.

352
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:31,999
And so it looks like she's got this kind of reddish splotch right here on her

353
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,120
so that this is the problem with being the daughter of a virus epidemiologist.

354
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:42,460
If she wakes up in the morning and she's like, Mom, I don't feel so good. I'm like, Oh, let me get a picture career going with that relaxer.

355
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:48,800
Oh, so muscle aches and suddenly not feeling well.

356
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:59,120
And when she turns 18, I guess I'm gonna have to get consent to use this of so so but not yet so severe.

357
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:05,570
So this is called fifth disease, right? Right. Some of these older viruses, like they were numbering them for a while.

358
00:43:05,570 --> 00:43:09,200
So this is this disease in children. It basically is pretty limited.

359
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:13,070
You have a you may have a fever and you've got that slapped cheek look,

360
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:17,510
you may have some aches and pains, but it's going to resolve relatively quickly.

361
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:28,399
However, you if you are infected, as if a child is infected and passes it to a pregnant woman who is sero negative,

362
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:33,920
who has not been exposed to this virus before and has a primary infection, it can be very serious.

363
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:38,390
You can have a risk of miscarriage. You can have intrauterine fetal death.

364
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:44,059
The estimates for risk of fetal loss are 3 to 10%.

365
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:45,620
And so they're very high.

366
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:54,499
And so this is one thing that, you know, that's sort of the one precaution around being careful around kids, getting parvovirus.

367
00:43:54,500 --> 00:44:02,750
B19 So I actually had a dinner plans with, with Dr. Zeller and his pregnant wife when she woke up like this.

368
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:06,710
And it's like, no hope. We're staying home to get around to that.

369
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:13,969
Oh, all right. So approximately 50% of pregnant women are sera negative for previous parvovirus.

370
00:44:13,970 --> 00:44:20,000
B 19. There's no really other preventive strategies other than just keeping them away from infected children.

371
00:44:23,550 --> 00:44:29,879
Okay. So that is. Let me know if you have any questions about the end of the viruses and pregnancy slide.

372
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:38,160
I'm going to switch over and do a few minutes of herpes viruses and then we'll just do a quick discussion of the EBV article.

373
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:53,950
All right. Herpes viruses.

374
00:44:53,950 --> 00:44:58,390
So herpes viruses are great.

375
00:44:58,870 --> 00:45:03,190
They're all going to have this sort of overall structure in common.

376
00:45:03,790 --> 00:45:09,190
They're all going to be double stranded DNA genomes with an icosahedron nucleocapsid.

377
00:45:09,610 --> 00:45:19,480
They do have an envelope and they are organized into active and latency associated transcripts.

378
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:24,220
So if you notice this, this picture of the genome at the bottom,

379
00:45:25,150 --> 00:45:31,660
some of these genes are kind of marked as being licensed latency, associated transcripts.

380
00:45:31,990 --> 00:45:36,760
So what this genome does and I'll show you in more detail in a second, but once this enters a cell,

381
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:43,270
you may have production of proteins in the active phase coming from some parts of the genome.

382
00:45:43,690 --> 00:45:49,720
And then some of the proteins are produced only when the virus is latent in the latent in the leading phase.

383
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:58,660
And so you have this, again, kind of highly ordered and systematic production of proteins, depending on what part of the cycle the virus is in.

384
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:03,130
It's not like these small RNA viruses where it's like all the proteins all the time.

385
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:07,600
It's like depends on what part of the cycle. So.

386
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:22,270
So. So the when you're looking at HSV, you've got different parts, different subfamilies of the virus,

387
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:30,460
you've got the alpha subfamily, you've got beta, and then you've got gamma for the different human to human viruses.

388
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:39,460
Something to note about this is that herpes viruses use many different types of cell receptors.

389
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:50,950
And in terms of latency, many of the herpes viruses that have a latent phase in cells can become latent in many different types of cells as well.

390
00:46:52,810 --> 00:47:01,780
So this is really important as we think about, for instance, the development of our understanding of the epidemiology of HSV one and HSV two.

391
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:07,330
HSV one simplex virus one was often called the oral the oral virus.

392
00:47:16,470 --> 00:47:23,790
And bring it. Dealer And the number two is the sorry is the genital virus.

393
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:55,680
Okay. But because there's a pretty wide array of cells you can have infection in with HSV one and with HSV two, you can actually have site switching.

394
00:47:56,070 --> 00:48:03,390
So you don't have limiting of those of those viruses to that particular cell type by body side.

395
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:18,850
All right. So alpha herpes viruses are going to be latent in the neurons in the sensory sensory ganglia.

396
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:23,680
They tend to cause you go cutaneous infection.

397
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:27,339
So by that I mean skin lesions.

398
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:31,180
You're going to have skin lesions. But notice that they are not latent in the skin.

399
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:33,310
They're latent in the neurons, in the sensory ganglia.

400
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:39,130
So what I'm going to show you in a minute is that herpes viruses also herpes virus has become latent in the neurons,

401
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:42,970
travel to that site in the skin and then formalism.

402
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:48,610
So oftentimes you see people that have recurrent lesions will have them in the same spots.

403
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:57,390
And that's because that's the spot in the neuron. And that's where the neuron delivers the virus to all of our brains.

404
00:48:57,430 --> 00:49:05,770
Viruses are highly, highly virulent cell culture. Bayer Herpes viruses are different in that they replicate very slowly,

405
00:49:06,730 --> 00:49:13,830
so they are latent in T cells, b cells like cells, and they don't have that same virulence to them.

406
00:49:19,170 --> 00:49:23,240
Okay. I'm going to switch to the workshop. I'm having too much of a bronchospasm.

407
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:27,980
So wrong about that. You probably don't want to listen.

408
00:49:28,010 --> 00:49:31,860
You have to hold on. Okay, let's switch to the workshop.

409
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:37,520
EVP. Let me switch. Actually, let me just go to. I'm going to come back to these pieces.

410
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:41,180
Don't worry. I will tell you more about the the ganglia.

411
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:48,200
I won't let you go through this class now learning about it. I'm going to switch ahead to EB.

412
00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:58,610
All right. So Epstein-Barr virus, the virus I want to talk about today is the most common cause of infectious mononucleosis.

413
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:02,530
So about 79% of mono is caused by EBV.

414
00:50:02,550 --> 00:50:08,720
EBV 45.2 cases per 100,000 per year.

415
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:17,629
So it's quite common. It's highest in 15 to 24 year olds under ten years of ten years of age.

416
00:50:17,630 --> 00:50:23,990
These infections are typically subclinical, so it is quite likely that it's not necessarily highest in that age group,

417
00:50:23,990 --> 00:50:34,770
but that's the age group that we most often identify. All right.

418
00:50:35,250 --> 00:50:39,210
We see incidence is the same in women versus men,

419
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:49,650
but younger in women because mono is transmitted through oral contact most frequently the

420
00:50:49,650 --> 00:50:54,150
sexually maybe a relationship structure thing societally that's developed over time.

421
00:50:57,630 --> 00:50:59,250
I really want to tell you the story.

422
00:51:03,370 --> 00:51:17,650
So EBV was first discovered in a patient with Burkitt lymphoma, which is a type of cancer, and it was implicated in some cases of Hodgkin's lymphoma.

423
00:51:17,890 --> 00:51:20,650
It was implicated in cases of measles peritoneal carcinoma.

424
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:26,410
But there had been and when this was discovered, there had been actually been very little virology.

425
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:36,940
The virus hadn't hadn't been isolated. And there had been very little like actual confirmation, like laboratory confirmation that this was happening.

426
00:51:38,110 --> 00:51:47,629
So what happened is people were in different areas of the world, particularly in different areas of Africa,

427
00:51:47,630 --> 00:51:54,790
and like describing these different clinical syndromes and trying to get viral isolates because there was a suspicion that it was a virus,

428
00:51:54,790 --> 00:51:57,880
but it wasn't ever. They weren't able to to document it.

429
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:05,410
So they were sending all these isolates back to a lab in the summer in England.

430
00:52:05,770 --> 00:52:13,210
There it was in London and shipping them by air to a four for Virologic study.

431
00:52:14,770 --> 00:52:23,350
Then winter comes and there's a big there's a big snowstorm and there's in every ice, every set of isolates they had been getting previously.

432
00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:26,200
They were trying to culture them. They were coming up with nothing.

433
00:52:26,230 --> 00:52:32,410
So there was still like no virologic cause of of Burke Burkitt lymphoma and these, these clusters that they're fighting.

434
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:37,750
And so one of the shipments, however, got caught in a snowstorm in England.

435
00:52:37,750 --> 00:52:44,920
So the shipment of samples from Africa got a necessary in England and the flight got diverted to a different airport in the UK.

436
00:52:45,610 --> 00:52:49,689
The amount of time it took to get the shipment off of the diverted plane,

437
00:52:49,690 --> 00:52:56,860
it took like a week to get that shipment from there back to the London lab to be able to test for the virus.

438
00:52:57,380 --> 00:53:01,060
So by the time it got there, they opened it up, they plated it,

439
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:04,660
they figured like nothing was going to happen because nothing had happened for all the previous samples.

440
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:06,850
And these samples were chock full of virus.

441
00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:12,850
It turns out that EBV, because they didn't have electron microscopy at the time, they were using visual microscopy.

442
00:53:13,540 --> 00:53:19,750
The EBV grows so, so slowly that they were testing the samples before there was anything to see.

443
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:23,500
They had not that you had to you have to culture them, really.

444
00:53:23,740 --> 00:53:29,110
So remember when I told you one of the big differences between the families of herpes viruses is how virulent you are.

445
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:35,760
EBV is a good example of an incredibly slow growing virus, so slow that they couldn't even, like,

446
00:53:35,770 --> 00:53:41,670
detect that it was in these samples without a snowstorm delaying the experiments by a week.

447
00:53:43,210 --> 00:53:46,570
So super interesting from that perspective.

448
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:58,300
All right. I'm going to switch you over to doing the workshop and we will pick up other pieces of herpes

449
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:06,340
virus when I am able to talk for a longer period of time without having an exacerbation.

450
00:54:08,170 --> 00:54:11,260
All right. So let's stop there. I post two groups.

451
00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:16,090
I will pull up them for you right now to.

452
00:54:18,910 --> 00:54:22,060
The question should be released, but.

453
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:27,880
I was.
