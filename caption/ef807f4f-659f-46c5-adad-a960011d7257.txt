1
00:00:05,114 --> 00:00:08,490
Qualitative research,
what is it and when do we use it?

2
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,651
In a nutshell, qualitative research is
most valuable when we want to construct

3
00:00:12,651 --> 00:00:16,456
understandings from the perspective
of the people we are researching.

4
00:00:16,456 --> 00:00:21,690
So what kind of things come to mind when
you think about qualitative research?

5
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:24,180
Some common responses
are open ended questions,

6
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,660
that you wanna get
the perspectives of participants.

7
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:29,330
It's an opportunity to
explore new terrain.

8
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:33,840
We use qualitative research methods
to explore and explain issues,

9
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,450
public health topics.

10
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:38,840
Other things that come to mind
are that it's an iterative process and

11
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:44,450
you need to exercise flexibility
throughout to adopt procedures as needed.

12
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:46,950
So I wanna go over a few
differences between qualitative and

13
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,780
quantitative research methods.

14
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:54,260
So qualitative methods are really used for
exploratory purposes to generate ideas,

15
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:56,310
while quantitative methods
are often used for

16
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:59,890
confirmatory purposes to test hypotheses.

17
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:04,000
Qualitative methods focus on
the individual lived experience and

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,783
quantitative methods focus on many
people at once, or population-based.

19
00:01:08,783 --> 00:01:13,531
Qualitative methods have the kinda
goal of in depth, rich description or

20
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:15,454
understanding of the topic.

21
00:01:15,454 --> 00:01:19,120
While quantitative methods
aim to generalize findings

22
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,810
about the larger population.

23
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:26,190
Qualitative methods encourage us to ask
what is happening here while quantitative

24
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:31,030
methods encourage us to ask how much
is a certain issue or topic happening.

25
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:36,000
Qualitative methods, we often see
smaller sample sizes in comparison to

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,070
the larger sample sizes we often aim for
in quantitative research.

27
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:44,620
Some of the tools we use in qualitative
research are interviews, focus groups and

28
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:48,550
observations, as compared to some of
the tools we use in quantitative research,

29
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:52,710
which touches surveys, biomarkers,
medical charts, reviews.

30
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:56,700
I just compared and contrasted qualitative
and quantitative methods, but I wanted

31
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:01,110
to just kind of pose the question of is it
really qualitative versus quantitative?

32
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:05,374
Some researchers may have what is
called a one-sided paradigm allegiance.

33
00:02:05,374 --> 00:02:10,084
Which is they kind of really ascribe
to being a qualitative researcher or

34
00:02:10,084 --> 00:02:12,246
a quantitative researcher, but

35
00:02:12,246 --> 00:02:17,230
others argue that it's not necessarily
an either or paradigm allegiance.

36
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:19,910
So methods can be even
combined into one study,

37
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:24,810
in fact mixed methods research is gaining
in popularity across the health sciences.

38
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:28,860
This is especially true in public health,
where we often take an interdisciplinary

39
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:32,038
and team-based approach to tackling
pressing public health issues,

40
00:02:32,038 --> 00:02:35,250
multi-dimensionally and holistically.

41
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:39,360
So methodological appropriateness is
an approach that is pragmatic and

42
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,080
says that we should use
the method that is appropriate

43
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,960
to meet our specific research goal.

44
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:48,358
So that might be sometimes use qualitative
research, sometimes use quantitative,

45
00:02:48,358 --> 00:02:51,484
sometimes you use them together
in mixed methods research.

46
00:02:51,484 --> 00:02:55,746
So instead of thinking about it as a qual
versus quant approach to research,

47
00:02:55,746 --> 00:02:59,157
I invite you to think about
the research methods continuum.

48
00:02:59,157 --> 00:03:03,810
So as we can see here, we can think about
the qualitative-quantitative continuum.

49
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:08,280
So on our left, we have kind of the more
standard quantitative measurements like

50
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,250
experiments, structured surveys,
structured observations.

51
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:15,120
And then we can move along the continuum
to think about things like open-ended

52
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,500
questions on a survey, or
freelisting and piling.

53
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,380
And as we move further towards
the qualitative end of the continuum,

54
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,232
we see things like
focus-group discussions,

55
00:03:23,232 --> 00:03:28,620
semi-structured interviews, participant
observations, to unstructured interviews.

56
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:32,400
So really when I think about the value of
qualitative methods, they really help us

57
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,600
to answer the how, what, and why questions
we have in public health research.

58
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,380
We have this value additive gaining
perspective of participants.

59
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:44,400
And learning the language and
the ways in which participants talk about

60
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,970
the research issues or public health
problems we're interested in studying.

61
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:53,480
And qualitative methods allow
us to explore topics in depth.

62
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,420
But qualitative methods,
as you're kind of preparing for

63
00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:00,130
undertaking qualitative research,
it can take a lot of time in the field.

64
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:02,240
Some qualitative
researchers spend months or

65
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,400
even years in the field
conducting ethnographic research.

66
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,088
Qualitative research really requires
a flexibility that we might not

67
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:13,216
be accustomed to using if most of our
experience is in quantitative research,

68
00:04:13,216 --> 00:04:16,105
quantitative study design,
data collection, etc.

69
00:04:16,105 --> 00:04:20,363
And qualitative research, as you're
planning and preparing to undertake it,

70
00:04:20,363 --> 00:04:22,927
it also can take a lot of
time to analyze the data,

71
00:04:22,927 --> 00:04:27,012
especially as you go through kind of
more complex data analysis approaches.

72
00:04:27,012 --> 00:04:31,289
Qualitative research lends itself
to writing long text, and editing,

73
00:04:31,289 --> 00:04:35,159
and rewriting the text in order
to best disseminate the results.

74
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:39,722
And qualitative research lacks some of the
elements of structure we're used to seeing

75
00:04:39,722 --> 00:04:42,400
in quantitative research designs or
proposals.

76
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:47,188
So thinking again about some of the ideas
of when qualitative methods can be used

77
00:04:47,188 --> 00:04:48,340
in public health.

78
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:52,472
We see it in exploring new topics or
conducting exploratory research.

79
00:04:52,472 --> 00:04:56,410
Qualitative methods can be really
great in helping us when we're

80
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:59,203
developing new surveys or
new instruments and

81
00:04:59,203 --> 00:05:04,520
we want to maybe include and adapt scales
or develop new scales with a population.

82
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:08,140
Qualitative methods are used in
program evaluation, both process and

83
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,410
outcome evaluation methods.

84
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:14,420
Qualitative methods help us when we want
to ask questions about the feasibility and

85
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:18,170
acceptability of conducting
research with a new population.

86
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:20,620
Or for
thinking about doing an intervention.

87
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,600
Qualitative methods are great for

88
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,050
helping us think about how
we develop interventions and

89
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:30,050
how we can adapt existing interventions to
a new setting or with a new population.

90
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:33,430
Qualitative methods allow us to
further explore unexpected or

91
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:36,010
incomplete quantitative findings, and

92
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:41,220
qualitative methods are useful
in analyzing policies as well.

93
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:45,360
So when you're thinking about what type
of topics are conducive for qualitative

94
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,460
research, think about topics that
are oriented towards the subjective or

95
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,620
lived experience of people.

96
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,400
Qualitative methods are conducive for

97
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:58,050
topics which quantitative methods would
not necessarily be able to get at.

98
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:01,670
Qualitative methods are great when we
don't know very much about a topic and

99
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:05,770
we want to learn more, and we're
starting out on a new line of research.

100
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:07,190
Qualitative methods are good for

101
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:10,878
topics where attention is not
to maximize generalizability.

102
00:06:10,878 --> 00:06:15,212
Qualitative methods are great for topics
that focus on implicit social norms that

103
00:06:15,212 --> 00:06:17,673
organize individualized or group behavior.

104
00:06:17,673 --> 00:06:20,923
So kind of making these implicit
social norms explicit or

105
00:06:20,923 --> 00:06:24,376
making some of the mundane activities,
or perspectives and

106
00:06:24,376 --> 00:06:27,310
approaches, social norms, more explicit.

107
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:29,790
And qualitative methods are good topics

108
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:34,010
in where rich in-depth
description is the primary goal.

109
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:37,980
So in conclusion, in thinking about
the use of qualitative methods,

110
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,530
we often value and
emphasize different aspects or

111
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:44,340
methods in qualitative research
compared to quantitative research.

112
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:47,970
However, it really doesn't need
to be an either, or approach.

113
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:50,873
And qualitative research
helps us to answer the how,

114
00:06:50,873 --> 00:06:55,715
what and
why questions we have in public health.
