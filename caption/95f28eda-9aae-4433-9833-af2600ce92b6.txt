1
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:19,980
Good morning, everyone. Was the critical few extra minutes?

2
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:26,540
I think we're all on.

3
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:43,410
So we're done for the first part of the semester because now we're shifting into talking about newborn diseases,

4
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:48,420
adult onset disease and some of the ethical legal issues.

5
00:00:52,830 --> 00:01:07,620
So it's just nice to go over here where we args the class format kind of changes a little bit now so we won't have a lot of problems.

6
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:16,550
I think there's just one left. So today we'll finish the PKU lecture and have a short lecture.

7
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:23,130
We'll go over the readings and then we have a short lecture on General Hypothyroidism.

8
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:31,500
Next week we will start adult screening and that's kind of broken up over the seven and eight.

9
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:39,180
So part one is on Tuesday and then week A would be on first things you have full break.

10
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,630
Okay. This one here.

11
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:52,430
There's no in-person class next Thursday. This is a prerecorded lecture by Sharon Cargill's Lincoln associate dean for education.

12
00:01:52,430 --> 00:02:05,470
Now. I think so. She she has a really good lecture on eugenics and kind of touches upon the extreme of that in the U.S. for that there's so you would

13
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:18,360
have the video and there's a quiz based on that and then readings which we will go over the next time we meet if you have questions.

14
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:33,450
So, so yeah. So adult screening broken up in two parts and then we have a week on genetic association studies that one has that last problem said.

15
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:46,129
And then weeks, ten and 11 would be guest lecturers who would come and there's readings posted for it, but nothing.

16
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:49,950
And no prerecorded lectures? No. No quizzes.

17
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:56,590
And then. Exam two will be in about a month from now.

18
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:05,170
And remember, this is just it's not taken for, say, sometimes exam on campus.

19
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:09,910
You will have to open up. 1110.

20
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:16,120
You'll have two days to complete it, but once you open it up, you have 2 hours to complete that.

21
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:20,620
Okay, so it's mostly multiple choice.

22
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:25,180
I'll put out the study guide for exempt choose that you have it ahead of time.

23
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:31,600
There could be a lot of information in this part of the course, like on diseases,

24
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:40,690
and it can be hard to know what to want to know what kind of have hands even you will have access to and know it's for the exam.

25
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:44,559
But it's it's kind of a short, shorter time, like 2 hours.

26
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,340
So you want to make sure to have the information kind of.

27
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:53,569
Is like easily accessible, I guess.

28
00:03:53,570 --> 00:04:05,050
So the study guide should kind of help you figure out what to focus on as you prepare for for exams to ask me questions that.

29
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:17,399
Okay. And then. So I know you, for example, one will will will start rating me the greater community.

30
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:22,500
So we'll start this weekend and hopefully get it to you by a week or so.

31
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:28,310
Okay. That's.

32
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:42,240
And then for next week for the dog screening, there's for Tuesday, there's a prerecorded lecture on cystic fibrosis.

33
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,830
And we'll talk about Tay-Sachs in class.

34
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:54,170
So for next week, you have a short it's just 33 minutes of presentation.

35
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:58,350
Okay. Okay.

36
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:02,780
So so last time we started PKU.

37
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:09,150
So this is a congenital born condition.

38
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:16,830
It's it's it's it's hallmark is the deficiency in this enzyme.

39
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:24,870
So this is the great limiting step for people who have PKU.

40
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:30,330
And we have this enzyme kind of not functioning as you would expect it to.

41
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:36,000
And then we talked about how it is a result of recessive.

42
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:42,710
And it's the kind of this single gene disorder.

43
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,540
So you have mutations in the gene encoding the enzyme.

44
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:57,630
There's about 600 different disease causing mutations that gene we talked about

45
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:05,580
on the station and then we kind of stop here where we talk about the prevalence.

46
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:17,309
So the earliest frequency for four mutations in and leading to PKU are have a frequency

47
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:24,450
of one in 50 and then that ends up with a chance of kind of a recessive disorder,

48
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:28,350
one in 2500.

49
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:33,630
Now overall prevalence is about one in 15000 to 1 in 10,000.

50
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:39,690
There are variations in the prevalence by.

51
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,700
My ethnicity and ancestry.

52
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:50,680
Northern European and American Indians have a higher prevalence versus blacks, Hispanics and Asians who have lower prevalence.

53
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:58,240
Just just due to how kind of aliens frequencies vary in these populations.

54
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:03,819
And then in Michigan, about half the cases are classic, mild or moderate.

55
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:10,870
So it's not the extreme phenotype and 50 are the hyperphenylalaninemia.

56
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:15,070
So it's kind of the milder form of PKU.

57
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:31,210
And then if we look worldwide, we see kind of the same picture where the the prevalence of disease kind of varies by by populations.

58
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:52,129
Then for for treatment, there's treatment where a cofactor is kind of given to individuals who have a specific type of mutation.

59
00:07:52,130 --> 00:08:01,850
So beech floors, like a helper molecule that that kind of increases the rate of activity of the the enzyme.

60
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:03,920
So it kind of works with that enzyme.

61
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:14,120
So if you have a situation where the enzyme is there, it's kind of working, but it's not working for kind of efficiency.

62
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:25,250
People who are in that kind of bucket would benefit from this this pharmaceutical treatments and the b h molecule.

63
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:32,210
And then other than like drug treatment,

64
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:41,090
typically individuals with PKU are put on a strict diet where very high protein

65
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:47,630
foods are eliminated or minimized or kind of set at their tolerance level.

66
00:08:48,740 --> 00:09:04,580
And then usually this is covered by insurance, at least dietary supplements, and then something to kind of think about or maybe to be mindful of that.

67
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:12,620
Early on, while treating PKU, clinicians believe that the diet could be stopped at an earlier age, at an early age.

68
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:17,899
So the hypothesis was that this is when most of the brain development is happening.

69
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:23,389
So so they would minimize the exposure to phenylalanine at that age.

70
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:30,170
And then as they grew up, then they thought that it would be okay to kind of increase that.

71
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:36,440
But now we know that stopping the diet can still even in adults or in the

72
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:43,280
older age beyond 6 to 10 years can lead to drops in IQ learning disabilities.

73
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:54,400
And other like behavioral problems so related to the accumulation of the need and then some.

74
00:09:54,670 --> 00:10:08,379
Another thing is is thinking about moms who have PKU and how how important it is that they also return to the diet as they become

75
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:21,580
pregnant or if they want to be pregnant because it's been shown that women with PKU can have adverse outcomes affecting their babies.

76
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:31,000
So it can be abortions or it could be things affecting their offspring or their kids.

77
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:39,100
Microcephaly, like like a small brain size or small head size, mental retardation overall,

78
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:47,410
just a huge overall small baby size and then congenital congenital heart defects.

79
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:54,069
These questions. Yeah. Are those outcomes seen even if the child doesn't have PKU?

80
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:58,270
It's just the effects of the buildup in the mother's body that's impacting the development.

81
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:04,000
That's that's a good question. I feel like I would have to look up this study exactly.

82
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:13,090
And see if they excluded or said a certain like with no PKU.

83
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:22,510
But yeah. I don't know for sure. Yeah. Any other questions?

84
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:38,900
Okay. So just as we're talking about these newborn conditions, these are important concepts to kind of keep in mind.

85
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:48,740
So. So genetic heterogeneity, you might hear that term in class or, you know, maybe in other classes.

86
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:55,819
But these are this is where we we would say we have genetic heterogeneity.

87
00:11:55,820 --> 00:12:03,649
When you have mutations either in different genes or in different levels within the same gene, that can cause a disorder.

88
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:06,860
So the disorder is not happening due to kind of one thing.

89
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:12,770
You have, you know, different genes being involved or different elements within the same gene.

90
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:24,860
And then this can if we kind of break it down, we can think of it as we can think about it as to kind of two levels.

91
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:32,720
So locus, locus heterogeneity, that's when you have mutations in different genes that can cause the same disorder.

92
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:37,460
So here's where there's an example about the maple sirup.

93
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:44,149
You're in disorder and then element genetic, which is similar to what we're talking about in PKU,

94
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:54,920
where you have different mutations with the same genes. So in that case of PKU, that's the enzyme coding gene that can cause the same disorder.

95
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,920
And this is kind of an important concept that we kind of want to think about as we talk about other conditions,

96
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:06,260
whether they're showing locus heterogeneity or heterogeneity.

97
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:14,750
Okay. And then you see if one votes for this one.

98
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:18,799
Now, where did you slide?

99
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:30,230
In the seats. Okay, so, um, so we talked about how we have about 600 mutations that can happen in these specific genes.

100
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:34,130
And we talked about how PKU is a result of recessive.

101
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:41,389
So recessive meaning if you think about the abstract terms that we typically use is through a little right.

102
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:47,600
So we expect those people to be the ones that have PKU.

103
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,750
Right. And then we would call these as carriers.

104
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:59,360
Now, since we have 600 mutations and we have two copies of the gene, one coming from one, one coming from that,

105
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:10,460
then we could have two scenarios where the two copies of the gene that we have or an individual have, they can be exactly the same.

106
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:17,060
So that's kind of a true little a little like exactly the same mutation on both sides.

107
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:27,919
So we call that to a like homozygous. So like this, if you remember the nomenclature we have, we talked about early in the class,

108
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:35,629
so a certain amino acid being substituted for leucine then at position 39.

109
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:43,430
So you would have the same mutation happening on both sides of the both copies of the gene that came from mom and dad.

110
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:56,840
That would be true. Allelic homozygous and then also people who are kind of little a little in the abstract sense,

111
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:02,960
they could have two different mutations on on each copy of the gene.

112
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:07,370
Those would be we would call it compound heterozygous.

113
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,690
Is that clear? Any questions?

114
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:24,290
Yeah. So the person with the to throw me out is PKU because of their both just residual function are okay.

115
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:28,920
So it's going to depend on like what this mutation happened.

116
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:34,440
Like what? Like, where does, where does this mutation happen or what does it affect specifically?

117
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:44,010
I mean, you would probably think that having two allele homozygous would be kind of a rarer kind of thing.

118
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:48,990
Just because you're going to have to have the exact same mutation coming from both mom and dad.

119
00:15:50,460 --> 00:16:01,110
Like, how are you asking? Like how extreme the phenotype is or like how sick I guess it's going to depend on like, where was this the mutation due?

120
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:07,860
And then something else to kind of think about is so you have both copies of the genes, right?

121
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:10,110
One for mom, one from dad. And let's say.

122
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:23,010
But I mean, for you or for you, for the individual to have the enzyme function or to call them as PKU individuals like having you,

123
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:29,250
you would have both copies affected. So that's for sure. They could be affected at different levels.

124
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:39,900
So the function of them both are putting the enzyme right so that the final function of the enzyme is kind of a mix of those two mutations.

125
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:46,560
So you could have a mild we will talk about this in the in the reading, you can have a mild mutation on one side,

126
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:53,650
a moderate mutation on the other, and then the mix of it can lead to either moderate or mild.

127
00:16:53,700 --> 00:17:02,099
So you're kind of like you kind of having some forms of the enzymes that are working okay,

128
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:07,380
kind of supplement whatever is not working as a result of the other copy.

129
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:12,470
Yeah. Any questions? Yeah.

130
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:20,630
I'm a little confused about how the compound heterozygous related to the genetic articles we just talk about.

131
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,860
So. So there are.

132
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:30,930
You mean here? Yeah. So. So it is a form of heterogeneity.

133
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:37,950
So you have different mutations. So these are two mutations that are happening in the same gene.

134
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:45,720
So we're talking the so that the, the, the, the enzyme leading to PKU.

135
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:50,070
So we're talking about allele heterogeneity in this case.

136
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:55,830
Yeah. So we have two different kind of forms leading to PKU.

137
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:09,960
Any other questions? Yeah. In cases like the common heterozygous, we have multiple mutations for one specific, I guess, Jean or Leo.

138
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:17,400
Obviously those mutations are recessive and I know this isn't like a cut and dry, dominant recessive type situation,

139
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:26,879
but could one mutation be more dominant over another and then have like one recessive mutation completely drown out a different one?

140
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:34,680
Or are they always going to kind of be in combination? So I guess, yeah, it's it's going to depend what the mutation does.

141
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:43,650
But they're like, if we kind of look through the last note here, there's, there could be a mutation that totally knocks out the enzyme function.

142
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:49,770
So you have no enzyme whatsoever coming from that gene that has a certain mutation.

143
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:56,639
And then so whatever is coming from the other copy of the gene that's you could call it kind of dominating,

144
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,430
I guess, whatever enzyme is being produced.

145
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:12,600
And then remember that the enzyme is kind of a fear of it that this enzyme functions in like this tetra matrix structure.

146
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:18,150
So, um, so you, so you could have like a functional,

147
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:27,780
like maybe an oak functioning one over kind of being content being added to a non functioning monomer.

148
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:37,920
So it's going to vary a lot I guess, but the enzyme would, wouldn't need to kind of come together in this form for it to be functional.

149
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:49,380
So that was also like that kind of comes into play as we think about what individual, each individual gene is kind of coding.

150
00:19:50,910 --> 00:20:01,590
Yeah. So that's like what I was talking about is a specific case of compound heterozygous where you have one LDL that is totally not functional,

151
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:09,450
so it's not producing the enzyme whatsoever. And then the other end will have some function and we call those functionally hemi.

152
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:13,170
So I guess in these, these group of people are.

153
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:28,830
Kind of important to look at as we try to think about disease function like or as we try to think about what each mutation does to enzyme function.

154
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:36,930
Can you guys see why that is, why those groups of people would be interesting or helpful?

155
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:42,400
Yeah. And there's already some function you can like.

156
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,050
I don't know, maybe the.

157
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:55,680
That medication we just talked about where you like add something to the enzyme to work could be more helpful because they already have function.

158
00:20:56,160 --> 00:21:01,620
Yeah. So these people are like we know this mutation is not doing anything to the enzyme.

159
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:11,669
It's only this one. So it's kind of easier to kind of make the association between all of this mutation is causing this kind of effect on

160
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:22,110
the enzyme and this kind of effects on the overall PKU versus if you have two two mutations that have varying effects,

161
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:26,700
it's kind of harder to kind of. Kind of.

162
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:31,210
Tease out what what is what mutation is causing what.

163
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:40,440
Okay. We'll talk about this in the papers to use any questions on the other question.

164
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:50,150
Okay. So, um, so we have two meetings to go over.

165
00:21:50,960 --> 00:22:01,800
Um, let's start with the drivers first.

166
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:09,710
So the monogenic traits are not simple. Then we'll go back to the slides and talk about the other meeting.

167
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:16,430
There's few slides on it. So if you can, I don't like most, like not only said here,

168
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:23,930
but kind of find a group or use something, you know, where you're at least talking to someone.

169
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:29,960
Um, and then we'll go over some of the questions here.

170
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:39,320
Okay. So I'll give you maybe ten, 15 minutes just to kind of freshen up on the meeting and think about this study question.

171
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:52,170
So. Oh.

172
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:59,050
Students can go through again.

173
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:13,910
You know, it's nothing.

174
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:27,220
I just. I mean, I was like, you know.

175
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:37,230
Yeah. Yeah. So I was like, how are you taking?

176
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:53,870
Like, I need to know what I'm looking at.

177
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:58,260
Yeah, that's right. So.

178
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:07,140
Yeah. Yeah. Really? Like. Like think cause pushing.

179
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:28,410
Like. It is inconceivable to me.

180
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:34,450
So I highlighted the questions that I want you to think about and try to come up with an answer for.

181
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:47,840
She's. Which unsettled me.

182
00:24:52,430 --> 00:25:14,810
On one hand. And so.

183
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:28,260
Okay. And it's something I forgot to mention before. Like, for example, to the meetings are kind of part of the exam.

184
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:36,390
So it's to make sure that I'm still like, I'm on top of the meetings for this part.

185
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:49,980
Is that kind of hard to see the other part a little better?

186
00:25:50,190 --> 00:26:04,100
Yeah, I it's okay. I think I took up the keys and I was like, yes.

187
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:14,310
Three things.

188
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:51,130
In a lot of relationships, you're dealing with diseases like diabetes.

189
00:26:53,360 --> 00:27:10,490
One of the things that I think raised young families together important challenges, flight paths and secrets.

190
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:26,380
Do you wish we had girls? You know what? I really wish you all the best to share in that apology.

191
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:53,080
I am. This is actually just a.

192
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:18,050
It's. And.

193
00:28:25,020 --> 00:29:08,830
Some Canadians. She used to speak to speakers, but she did something different.

194
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:15,240
Something dealing with the blood brain barrier is.

195
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:49,230
It's a. Some segments of patients don't understand individual symptoms in symptoms similar.

196
00:29:56,250 --> 00:30:13,990
Okay. You want the territory to be equal to the kids?

197
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:30,610
I'm saving between the patient who's hurt to me, who's too many of the people to different jurisdictions.

198
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:41,690
This ability to produce is completely.

199
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:55,780
It's like anytime we have an oversight committee.

200
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:08,330
And because it's so different from mine, there's no order to put in your.

201
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:29,080
Many people seem to be using the strength that's been used in.

202
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:36,920
It was very hard.

203
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:46,700
This was very close to seven.

204
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:51,740
The number in different.

205
00:32:19,360 --> 00:33:31,340
Some. You can do Lucky.

206
00:33:46,300 --> 00:34:11,420
Shakes and ice cream fans images. Two more minutes this time.

207
00:35:07,320 --> 00:36:04,230
So much. Okay.

208
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:10,620
So. So let's go ahead and talk about this paper.

209
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:21,310
So who can tell me like overall, what's the what's the main message from the speaker?

210
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:39,090
Yeah. Well, I mean, like the title says it, but like there's a lot of other things that go into the typical expression of disease like PKU.

211
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:46,530
And it's not as simple as just like if you have the business wheels, it'll just show the same everybody.

212
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:51,030
Yeah, yeah. That's, that's, that's great. That's perfect.

213
00:36:51,030 --> 00:37:00,570
So even though they're monogenic with one gene being affected, one enzyme, I mean,

214
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:07,959
it's not really a straightforward and or as simple as just having a certain mutation

215
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:12,090
and having the expression of the disease or the trait that you're looking at.

216
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:25,980
So that kind of answers like maybe somewhat the first question about the three simple ways in which single gene traits can behave like complex traits.

217
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:32,160
So. So who can tell me you that is just listed in the paper.

218
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,500
Yeah, it's the ones that are listed. It's that.

219
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:41,730
But there's different phenotypes for the genotypes and like a single variation that the phenotypes can range for that.

220
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:46,589
And then there's blurring between the predicted phenotype from the genotype.

221
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:55,770
So that's not a simple relationship. And then the third is that there are some modifier genes and other factors that play into the phenotype.

222
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:59,489
So that makes it more complex. Yeah, that's that's great.

223
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:04,280
So the authors discuss ways in which those simple, quote unquote,

224
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:11,850
some simple diseases can also look like a complex disorder where you can have the effects of the modifier genes

225
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:21,210
environment between and then that not so simple 1 to 1 association between the genotype and the phenotype.

226
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:34,410
Um, so we can mean like this number so that the two important challenges to the hypothesis that the genotype consistently predicts a PKU phenotype.

227
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:45,840
Someone hasn't spoken before. I know it's hard. It's like after an exam, but I appreciate your being here and trying.

228
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:50,220
It's kind of a complex paper, but we'll try to take the main messages out of it.

229
00:38:52,170 --> 00:39:03,260
So the authors discuss ways by which their hypothesis that the genotype is like the that consistent association is not really seen.

230
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:10,470
So what do they talk about? Yeah.

231
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:19,649
Know, they mentioned that like people with identical mutant p h genotypes have completely different cognitive and metabolic phenotypes.

232
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:26,220
And they were talking about seeing it in families and like you've been like siblings specifically, so.

233
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:32,670
Yeah. Yeah, exactly. So. So people who are let me see.

234
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:37,680
It's this page. So, so basically.

235
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:50,790
Siblings who share share the same genotype end up having different phenotypes or different cognitive function.

236
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:55,890
It's not going to be exactly the same, even though they have the same mutation.

237
00:39:56,820 --> 00:40:07,540
And then there's a link, a discordance between what we can predict and what we actually observe in terms of mutation enzyme function,

238
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:12,000
like the downstream phenotypes that they talk about.

239
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:25,830
Okay. So the others like break down the PKU phenotype into kind of three levels or you can think about them closest to the.

240
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:36,840
I think this figure here is like really helpful, closest to the mutation and then down to the actual PKU phenotype.

241
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:43,080
So, so you have like a level where the enzyme is affected.

242
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:50,969
You can think about it like as you kind of further step away from the mutation, the metabolic phenotype,

243
00:40:50,970 --> 00:41:00,960
and then the cognitive phenotype where you actually end up seeing that effects of the accumulation of brain function.

244
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:13,140
So can someone tell me I kind of look just at the cognitive phenotype and and how how it's related to the metabolic and enzymatic phenotypes.

245
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:23,310
What is the cognitive phenotype that they're talking about? Just impaired cognitive development.

246
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:34,790
Yeah. So that the. Yeah. And then what is an important factor that kind of comes into play as far as like individuals kind of.

247
00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:42,070
Maybe separate in terms of how much of how much their cognitive phenotype is affected?

248
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:47,230
Well, it has to do with like untreated levels of the central alanine in the bloodstream.

249
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:54,520
And so then so that deals with the metabolic phenotype and then ends of that type not breaking those down.

250
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:58,030
And so that continues to increase in the bloodstream within that.

251
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:01,719
Yeah. So it's like the upstream kind of difference here.

252
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:06,370
And then they talk also about something on the blood brain barrier.

253
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:11,979
So that can that that's not related to the gene, you're saying,

254
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:20,230
but individuals can have difference in that and that kind of ends up affecting how much of the final alanine ends up in the brain.

255
00:42:20,770 --> 00:42:31,600
So that's like maybe another pathway or another mechanism that kind of affects this simple disorder and then the metabolic phenotype.

256
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:44,890
Which is also affected by how much dietary phenylalanine there is, how much the liver is up taking of that final alanine.

257
00:42:44,890 --> 00:42:53,660
So that's again, not related to the gene, but also by other mechanisms that can also affect how the PKU ends up.

258
00:42:54,910 --> 00:43:01,100
And then another factor is. The alternative metabolism.

259
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:07,930
So remember how you have accumulation of phenylalanine that kind of can end up being shunted into a different pathway.

260
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:13,040
So like how much the individual has of that pathway or how active it is.

261
00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:19,180
So how much of this technology is kind of being taken away by other mechanisms?

262
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:26,690
So that kind of defines the metabolic phenotype. So.

263
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:32,809
So the endemic phenotype is kind of similar to what we talked about in the lectures where you could have

264
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:41,210
different mutations leading to difference in how the enzyme ends up being functionally functioning.

265
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:51,980
And I feel like this is a really good figure talking about how the enzyme remember how we talked about the the folding of the enzyme.

266
00:43:51,990 --> 00:43:59,390
So this is like a one unit of the enzyme. And then to have a productive pathway, you need the enzyme to kind of look in that shape.

267
00:44:00,410 --> 00:44:08,360
And then in cases where you have a mutation, you have the the protein kind of not folded in the right way,

268
00:44:09,050 --> 00:44:14,690
ends up kind of coming together and definitely not looking like an active form.

269
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:23,780
And that makes it more susceptible to being degraded and yeah, more prone to, um,

270
00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:32,000
to, to being degraded by proteases or of protein making by protein breaking enzymes.

271
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:42,940
Okay. Any questions? Um, it's kind of a brief overview, but a question.

272
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:49,990
And then this is the last question about the population genetic characteristics.

273
00:44:50,590 --> 00:44:55,930
I feel like we can kind of go back to the paper to help us think through that, but we kind of talked about it.

274
00:44:55,930 --> 00:45:04,090
But I think that makes couple of mutations that kind of makes it hard to to really tease out what is happening.

275
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:19,960
So this paper, The Golden Papers, does a really interesting experiment where they tried to to look at to look out at the correlation between

276
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:30,670
105 mutations and I and the prediction of the phenotype to the PKU phenotype or a milder form of PKU.

277
00:45:32,290 --> 00:45:39,240
So it's a simple correlation model that they applied year.

278
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:45,880
So who who can tell me what's going on in this figure here?

279
00:45:46,060 --> 00:45:50,500
So if you're following on the the actual favorites like page 73.

280
00:45:50,650 --> 00:45:59,590
So, so we shift into the other paper is done with the Goldberg paper.

281
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:03,610
So who Goldberg who can tell me what's going on in this figure here?

282
00:46:09,070 --> 00:46:12,340
In fact. So the boys represent.

283
00:46:14,990 --> 00:46:20,800
Different forms of pitching you. And then.

284
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:26,600
What's on the. Six exits.

285
00:46:29,630 --> 00:46:37,220
You can go. Okay. Basically, we're trying to classify what the fino is, the broad phenotype,

286
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:43,280
and they broke it down into four categories and see what exactly like what mutations cause what.

287
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:47,750
So they were trying to group mutations into like certain categories.

288
00:46:47,990 --> 00:46:53,890
Yeah. Yeah. And if we look at this mutation, for example, what can we conclude?

289
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:57,440
Is it like we had one case?

290
00:46:58,660 --> 00:47:11,139
With mild people. You kind of since they're total four two cases with moderate PKU and then one case with classical PKU.

291
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:14,260
So what is that? What does that show mean?

292
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:25,310
One is a variety of PKU phenotypes that correlate with that mutation.

293
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:31,820
Yeah, exactly. So you could have one mutation that can end up showing.

294
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:40,580
Showing up differently. And then something to note like the the the title of this fear is not in the slides,

295
00:47:41,510 --> 00:47:48,320
but for this kind of and for this analysis, they only looked at functionally hemicycle as individuals.

296
00:47:48,550 --> 00:47:51,710
So do you guys remember we just talked about that.

297
00:47:51,830 --> 00:47:57,979
Those are people who have a nonfunctioning like this is the only mutation that is affecting that

298
00:47:57,980 --> 00:48:05,810
phenotype because the other copy is now or it's not it's not it's not producing the enzyme at all.

299
00:48:05,990 --> 00:48:13,910
So it's kind of easier to say that this mutation is kind of leading to that sort of phenotype.

300
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:32,629
Yeah. So if we look across the plot, um, some very, some are like more maybe this last one is a lot of the cases maybe over like 85% were mild PKU.

301
00:48:32,630 --> 00:48:43,550
So it's, it's going to vary. And then who can tell me what this table is is showing.

302
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:09,630
So the question from the other side. So you said a 3904 function.

303
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:17,430
I mean, so I guess what are the odds that individuals are functionally like this?

304
00:49:17,970 --> 00:49:21,510
So that alone is somewhat functional? Yes.

305
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:26,090
Yeah. So, remember, each individual will carry two mutations.

306
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:32,960
Right. But these are individuals who their second mutation is not producing the enzyme at all.

307
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:37,310
So it's kind of like taken out of the picture. And then that makes it simpler.

308
00:49:37,370 --> 00:49:41,930
We can look at just the one mutation and look at how it's affecting the phenotype.

309
00:49:42,590 --> 00:49:45,730
So these all have residual function? Yes.

310
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:51,470
Yes. These are mutations that are not totally knocking out the enzyme.

311
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:58,810
Yeah. Any other questions?

312
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:06,070
Okay. So so this is like the effect of a single mutation, right?

313
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:10,480
And then the overall goal was to look at.

314
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:19,120
Did the overall genotype or the full kind of picture and how it relates to the phenotype.

315
00:50:19,130 --> 00:50:24,400
So what what did the authors do next? Someone told me.

316
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:27,670
Now I'll help you get started,

317
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:37,360
which I think is related to what we were talking about earlier in terms of like two mutations and it's kind of like a combination of their effects.

318
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:50,020
So they assigned each, I guess, phenotype a number and then looked at that mutation, saw what phenotype that mutation typically exhibits.

319
00:50:50,470 --> 00:50:58,870
And then if you add up the numbers from the first mutation, second mutation, it can help to predict the phenotype that that combination would give.

320
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:04,540
Yeah. Yeah. So, so now they're going to they're trying to look at kind of a bigger picture.

321
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:07,880
They're trying to look at the combination of mutations.

322
00:51:07,890 --> 00:51:18,520
So they're looking at like they assigned like a predicted mutation level for each of those mutation and then kind of put them together.

323
00:51:18,530 --> 00:51:25,120
So we're looking at the phenotype effects from the first mutation, if it's like a classic PKU,

324
00:51:25,810 --> 00:51:30,880
and then we have another mutation, the other mutation on the other chromosome being and classic PKU,

325
00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:41,500
then you would almost like you could end up with a classic PKU or something milder of the classic PKU just because you

326
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:48,610
could have a kind of a mixed up of effect or like you could have the enzyme functions being supplemented by each other.

327
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:58,509
So, so if we look at like them treating the mild PKU, if it comes with a mild PKU,

328
00:51:58,510 --> 00:52:10,420
then you're most likely to have mild PKU or like a non PKU form of just higher hyper alanine.

329
00:52:13,310 --> 00:52:16,970
Is that clear? Any questions?

330
00:52:20,590 --> 00:52:24,130
Okay. And this is kind of showing still the same.

331
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:32,170
Just comparing the observed phenotype with the expected based on what they found about the combination of mutations,

332
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:42,000
individuals that we expect to have classic PKU based on their mutations or genotype often ends up with a classic phenotype,

333
00:52:42,010 --> 00:52:47,379
or it could be a milder form of it. And then so if these numbers are not perfect,

334
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:58,930
like you could still have some kind of like a non non matching kind of association, but there's like measurement error.

335
00:52:58,930 --> 00:53:04,530
But the overall message is that think it's kind of written here clearly.

336
00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:11,740
So the disease severity in most cases is determined by the least severe of the two age mutations.

337
00:53:12,610 --> 00:53:19,330
Okay. And then if you have two mutations with similar severity,

338
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:26,650
they might end up being a milder form of the phenotype because they are kind of supplementing the function of working together.

339
00:53:28,490 --> 00:53:39,569
So I guess the last point about this table here is just thinking about like when we do these form

340
00:53:39,570 --> 00:53:45,750
of studies and we have like a rare disease where we're pulling cases from multiple centers,

341
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:54,269
a factor that kind of comes into play is that those centers could end up classifying things differently,

342
00:53:54,270 --> 00:53:57,870
or you could have it that as a factor kind of affecting your results.

343
00:54:02,070 --> 00:54:05,410
Yeah. Any questions on PKU before we kind of.

344
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:21,660
Okay. So let's talk about congenital hypothyroidism.

345
00:54:30,230 --> 00:54:34,100
So who who has heard about hypothyroidism or knows about it?

346
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:41,580
What context you do is you have to.

347
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:46,980
Yeah. So could you tell me what context you've learned about hypothyroidism?

348
00:54:49,630 --> 00:54:54,100
Usually within the adult populations in, like, autumn universes.

349
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:58,960
Yeah, that's great. Yeah, that.

350
00:55:00,650 --> 00:55:04,280
Same in, like a bio class. Yeah.

351
00:55:05,090 --> 00:55:13,879
So you add this to this condition, like, could be congenital where it shows up in the kind of earlier life, early in life.

352
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:22,520
Or it could be more you could have more of an adult onset where you had the function of the or the

353
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:31,880
function of the thyroid or the amount of enzymes secreted by the thyroid to kind of decrease or increase.

354
00:55:34,340 --> 00:55:41,980
And or you could have a, like an auto immune response where you have the your body kind of attacking the the thyroid gland.

355
00:55:45,110 --> 00:55:47,150
So these are learning objectives.

356
00:55:48,680 --> 00:56:00,230
So so when we talk about congenital hypothyroidism, we're talking about specifically like Thyroxine or T4 hormone deficiency.

357
00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:05,780
So so this deficiency has to kind of be present at birth.

358
00:56:06,740 --> 00:56:22,040
And then it's it kind of shows up as symptoms affecting the skin, constipation, jaundice and then poor muscle tone.

359
00:56:23,210 --> 00:56:31,250
And then treatment is important because if left untreated, it can lead to mental retardation and growth problems.

360
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:41,480
So forms of congenital hypothyroidism could be broken down into three kind of classes.

361
00:56:41,930 --> 00:56:52,360
This genesis is when you have the actual plant itself being absent or malformed or kind of misplaced.

362
00:56:52,370 --> 00:57:02,630
So ectopic. And then so this is related to the actual structure or the how the thyroid where the thyroid is against.

363
00:57:03,470 --> 00:57:10,280
And then it could be this hormonal genesis. That's when the thyroid is there, is intact.

364
00:57:10,290 --> 00:57:20,420
But the function of it or the ends, the hormones that it produces are kind of affected or pathways are affected along the way.

365
00:57:20,780 --> 00:57:27,470
And then the last one is iodine deficiency. And that's mostly in underdeveloped countries.

366
00:57:28,290 --> 00:57:29,870
Not really seen in the US.

367
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:41,690
So can you, can you guys think of what why we don't really see it and and useful nutrients gathering because we supplement iodine and salt.

368
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:54,350
Yeah. Yeah, exactly. So I think that was done in maybe the thirties that iodine was added to salt to help provide this important

369
00:57:55,010 --> 00:58:03,800
nutrient and avoid having hypothyroidism in people as a result of just not having that time in their diet.

370
00:58:05,210 --> 00:58:17,120
Okay. So in terms of statistics, this is more common than PKU, if you think about the PKU numbers.

371
00:58:17,870 --> 00:58:25,250
So in the US, it's one in every 4000, 3000, 4000 births.

372
00:58:25,730 --> 00:58:38,450
Females that are more likely to be affected. And as we saw maybe for PKU this the prevalence would vary by ancestry and by by race.

373
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:44,410
And then babies with Down syndrome also have a higher probability of having hypothyroidism.

374
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:48,900
I think it's related to some other function being affected.

375
00:58:51,570 --> 00:59:05,340
Okay. So. So I said that hyperthyroidism is usually a result of this important hormone tea for being kind of nuts,

376
00:59:05,340 --> 00:59:09,090
not secreted enough or not, not, not, not produced enough.

377
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:20,700
So it might be helpful. Like remember how we talk about PKU that it's tyrosine that's being changed to tired of seeing T4 is actually

378
00:59:21,390 --> 00:59:31,020
two times molecules kind of bound together and then each of those have an iodine molecule added to it.

379
00:59:31,020 --> 00:59:37,050
And that ends up being the thyroxine hormone that that we're talking about.

380
00:59:38,210 --> 00:59:47,300
It's cold, so it's an ice. So it's a combination of two IO and you needed amino acids and thyroid hormones are

381
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:56,900
powerful regulators that set lots of pathways and act as catalysts for many reactions.

382
00:59:57,500 --> 01:00:01,550
And as we said, reduced levels can lead to mental retardation.

383
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:05,360
And so this it's it's important to measure that.

384
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:14,600
And then if we just think about the pathways, our pathways by which t force kind of regulate it,

385
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:28,850
so we have the hypothalamus producing the thyroid releasing hormone and then that that kind of binds to receptors on the pituitary gland.

386
01:00:28,850 --> 01:00:35,480
This is the master plan that kind of controls a lot of the hormone production in the body.

387
01:00:36,410 --> 01:00:47,690
So it secretes secretes the thyroid stimulating hormone, which in turn kind of stimulates the thyroid to produce the T4.

388
01:00:47,690 --> 01:00:53,389
And then there's another form three that we we're not going to really talk about.

389
01:00:53,390 --> 01:01:01,310
But so, so this is how the t 3 to 4 kind of.

390
01:01:04,010 --> 01:01:08,360
Pathway is kind of set up.

391
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:12,260
And then as you have more tier three and four,

392
01:01:12,530 --> 01:01:22,399
there's like a negative feedback mechanism that you have more to to before you have signaling that tells the hypothalamus and the

393
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:30,680
pituitary gland to kind of decrease the production of this stimulating hormone just because we had enough we have enough levels.

394
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:40,250
So. So you've probably heard about this and other classes like the HP axis and the feedback mechanisms related to.

395
01:01:42,010 --> 01:01:47,280
Any questions? Okay.

396
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:54,660
So. So something important to know about congenital hypothyroidism.

397
01:01:55,050 --> 01:02:04,490
So probably out of the out of the conditions that we talk about in this class, this is the one that has the most non genetic component.

398
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:11,309
So most of the cases that we see are not really related to genetic diseases.

399
01:02:11,310 --> 01:02:24,990
They're just sporadic or just happening randomly or or a mutation that could happen after looking at a germline mutation, not an inherited mutation.

400
01:02:24,990 --> 01:02:29,790
So. So that's kind of important to note about stage.

401
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:39,880
And then if we look look at the two types that we've talked about, this genesis and that this hormonal genesis,

402
01:02:40,780 --> 01:02:46,240
this form here where the where the hormone function is affected is more likely to be inherited.

403
01:02:47,740 --> 01:02:55,660
But overall, if you look at the numbers, out of all the cases, about only about 15% are due to inherited mutation.

404
01:02:56,530 --> 01:03:11,420
Okay. So this genesis where you can have the actual structure of the thyroid gland affected,

405
01:03:12,830 --> 01:03:22,280
could be result of epigenetic phenomena or changes and or early somatic mutations that happen after this like goodness form.

406
01:03:24,090 --> 01:03:30,450
And again, this homeowner genesis could have a stronger genetic effect, but is still more likely to be just sporadic.

407
01:03:35,310 --> 01:03:45,140
This is kind of breaking it down a bit more so that this genesis is only a small component being inherited.

408
01:03:45,380 --> 01:03:49,220
Only 2% would have positive family history.

409
01:03:49,550 --> 01:03:57,530
And then if we look at the genetics of that, it looks like it's a dismal, dominant, but with very little penetrance.

410
01:03:58,010 --> 01:04:05,569
So so to actually for carriers to develop CHL, less than 7% would do that.

411
01:04:05,570 --> 01:04:08,830
So it's fairly low penetrance. Okay.

412
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:18,530
And then females are more likely to be affected and this can happen as a result of the mutation

413
01:04:18,530 --> 01:04:25,639
in the eight genes is an important gene that is affected when the embryos developing.

414
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:33,770
And so it's involved in the make up of tissues and organs and especially the thyroid gland.

415
01:04:34,950 --> 01:04:45,870
Okay. And then for discussion one to Genesis and it's a little more genetic component.

416
01:04:45,870 --> 01:04:53,490
So we're talking 10 to 15 where you have the hormones affected.

417
01:04:55,280 --> 01:05:06,259
And something along that pathway where the hormone synthesis is happening is not working and this looks more open or is only recessive for both

418
01:05:06,260 --> 01:05:19,220
the disease and then the genes that could be involved could be in different places or play a different role than the synthesis of the T4.

419
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:30,459
So test receptor, sodium iodide and porter thyroid proceedings, enzyme and thyroid globulin are some of the genes that could be affected.

420
01:05:30,460 --> 01:05:37,490
And we'll see them in a figure, Nancy, which like at least which part they play in the hormone synthesis.

421
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:47,480
So this one, gene, is actually the most common form of the of the defect.

422
01:05:48,290 --> 01:06:01,550
Just this enzyme here is the most commonly affected when you have inherited this harmonic genesis affecting the thyroid, and we'll see what it does.

423
01:06:01,730 --> 01:06:11,530
I think this figure is really good. So. So you have this silent globulin, which is like a big protein molecule that finds the time seen.

424
01:06:11,540 --> 01:06:19,339
So these are the two thyroxine molecules we talked about early and the thyroid oxidase does two important functions.

425
01:06:19,340 --> 01:06:24,860
So it first binds the iodine to each of those tyrosine molecules.

426
01:06:26,370 --> 01:06:35,010
And then it kind of binds together to iodine, iodine and tyrosine and makes up the thyroxine.

427
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:40,710
Okay. The questions, I'd be like, Why aren't you?

428
01:06:41,290 --> 01:06:44,770
So is this this hormonal genesis? Yeah.

429
01:06:45,220 --> 01:06:51,640
Yeah, this is a yeah. I mean, this is kind of a oh, that appropriately functioning.

430
01:06:52,270 --> 01:06:55,929
But if you have a this is like a properly functioning pathway.

431
01:06:55,930 --> 01:07:00,660
But if you have the oxidase enzyme not working.

432
01:07:00,670 --> 01:07:08,860
So as a result of mutation and this gene coding for this enzyme, you could have those steps kind of affected as,

433
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:23,320
as as the ones building up the stuff for the heart and then just seeing kind of another way how the teeth were just kind of synthesized.

434
01:07:23,860 --> 01:07:31,809
So the thyroid has many kind of specialized cells and this is a thyroid follicle, so one thyroid.

435
01:07:31,810 --> 01:07:35,740
So we're kind of zooming in on this section here.

436
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:44,620
Um, so the first step for walk through this figure is that you have the, the, the blood,

437
01:07:45,430 --> 01:07:53,829
blood here and then at the cell kind of wall, you have this sodium and iodine supporter.

438
01:07:53,830 --> 01:07:59,080
So it settles in the sodium and the iodine. So remember, we need the eyes on to build up the thyroxine.

439
01:08:00,040 --> 01:08:04,390
So this is a simple, important that if you have a mutation here,

440
01:08:04,750 --> 01:08:14,170
you don't have as well a functioning kind of port to get the iodine from the from the blood.

441
01:08:14,890 --> 01:08:19,330
So this is like one place where the the synthesis can be affected.

442
01:08:19,870 --> 01:08:24,010
So iodine is picked up from the blood, kind of concentrated in the cell.

443
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:28,360
And then up here you see the thyroid globulin.

444
01:08:28,360 --> 01:08:35,410
So this is the big protein molecule that kind of like a backbone where the the buildup of the thyroxine happens.

445
01:08:36,790 --> 01:08:48,430
So if you have a a problem with this big molecule that the fire scene synthesis would be affected, and then this is where you have the thyroid person.

446
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:55,660
So the enzyme we just talked about was kind of does its thing where as the iodine to the side is seeing.

447
01:08:58,770 --> 01:09:12,470
And then the conjugation. So combining the two thyroxine molecules and then kind of the secretion of the, the final T4 hormone.

448
01:09:12,510 --> 01:09:19,320
So so basically a lot of the parts and the mutation that's in any of those genes

449
01:09:19,350 --> 01:09:26,220
encoding one of those proteins can kind of end up messing up the T T4 synthesis.

450
01:09:28,170 --> 01:09:33,670
Any questions? Okay.

451
01:09:34,620 --> 01:09:44,189
It's not much left. So. So for newborn screening, typically we test for the T4 and also the test H.

452
01:09:44,190 --> 01:09:51,550
So this is this stimulating hormone that kind of acts on the thyroid gland to make it, to make it produce that T4.

453
01:09:51,570 --> 01:10:00,120
So it's kind of a step up. So it's, it could be, it could be informative as in why you do not have enough T4.

454
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:03,600
So typically both are tested.

455
01:10:04,620 --> 01:10:14,520
It is, it could, could kind of have a surge like right after birth but kind of stabilizes several days after.

456
01:10:14,690 --> 01:10:23,850
So so we'll see that sometimes like you have to do repeat testing after the baby's born, like maybe in a couple of days or so.

457
01:10:24,210 --> 01:10:27,360
Just give time for the hormones levels to stabilize.

458
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:41,530
Michigan does test for both. So typically the T4 is measured for first and then the test H is checked if there's a problem with the T4.

459
01:10:41,580 --> 01:10:48,809
So this is just showing like how the basically what I just said,

460
01:10:48,810 --> 01:10:59,130
if the kind of the the levels of testing that are done as part of the newborn screening for congenital hypothyroidism.

461
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:05,130
Basically what you have to know is if it's normal as normal, no further testing.

462
01:11:05,460 --> 01:11:09,630
If it's slow, then test h might be tested.

463
01:11:10,990 --> 01:11:20,740
If it's not clear, might repeat that when the baby is older and then if it's t for low but t h is normal,

464
01:11:20,740 --> 01:11:24,610
then you could have additional testing being done.

465
01:11:25,480 --> 01:11:30,850
And then I think the high risk group of babies that could have.

466
01:11:38,660 --> 01:11:45,950
Like I think it talks about people who are babies that are just high risk of complications.

467
01:11:46,580 --> 01:11:53,660
They're smaller or they're born early or had like admission to the intensive unit.

468
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:58,250
So there's those kids are kind of tested again, just to confirm.

469
01:11:58,470 --> 01:12:04,970
So so multiple stops we're testing is done just to confirm this.

470
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:07,009
You don't really have to know this,

471
01:12:07,010 --> 01:12:17,389
but it just shows all the level of testing and diagnostic stops that we kind of have to take from from finding out that we have

472
01:12:17,390 --> 01:12:30,200
multi four to kind of really telling whether it's the thyroid that's affected or it's hormonal or or what's going on or yeah.

473
01:12:30,210 --> 01:12:38,360
So, so kind of like investigative work trying to decide what to figure out what's going on.

474
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:54,650
Um, so overall this condition is, is treatable, but it's important to be kind of identified early in life.

475
01:12:55,100 --> 01:12:58,310
So if you look, we looked at IQ.

476
01:12:58,340 --> 01:13:01,489
Think about IQ as like a normal trait.

477
01:13:01,490 --> 01:13:12,979
We're like the average is 100. So babies that that were treated before three months had just about kind of ten point drops in their

478
01:13:12,980 --> 01:13:23,660
IQ versus starting treatment after six months where you have like a more a stronger impact on IQ.

479
01:13:24,290 --> 01:13:33,109
So the earlier the better like in terms of treatment and treatment is is as simply as administrating

480
01:13:33,110 --> 01:13:41,629
or giving to you for so hormone therapy and that the level is kind of closely monitored or tighter,

481
01:13:41,630 --> 01:13:52,880
tighter to that. We do not do the exact club needed that's established like in the first 2 to 3 years of life in babies.

482
01:13:54,210 --> 01:13:58,690
See that's the the last of the slides. Any questions on c h.

483
01:14:09,250 --> 01:14:12,610
So yes, we can just wrap up for the day.

484
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:19,209
Remember, for next time you have, you know, a prerecorded lecture on cystic fibrosis.

485
01:14:19,210 --> 01:14:29,240
And I'm talking about in class, there's a short meaning to your side that don't interfere with you.
