1
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:14,600
I know he called upon us about things like we had a soul mate cut down on New Orleans, like the problems I experienced prior to.

2
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:22,260
So. Yeah, and mine's like really a lot worse because like if you, if you answer all the questions,

3
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:30,660
like it's really just like the recommendation which I like was like I feel like I get those points and like, yeah, because I had more.

4
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:34,680
That's why I was like, Oh no, I'm not in politics.

5
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,020
I somehow or another, I'm, I'm not too concerned about it.

6
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:46,770
But Brandon, you come out September one of the day, we can like kind of talk about policy.

7
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:51,640
Yeah. Are you saying that paragraph to 9 a.m.

8
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:56,250
Yeah. Right or not. I just yeah, for sure.

9
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:00,030
And I just wrote that. So I have astrocytes on my right here.

10
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:06,350
I have these big chunks of time. Yeah. I was like, I wrote them out based on, like my research.

11
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:10,430
Yeah, for sure. But I, I kind of like this.

12
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:15,930
And then after that, I was like, this. This makes sense that we really are in the homestretch here.

13
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:19,410
And yeah. So yeah.

14
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:26,280
Here's a few things to finish up for the last time we talked about sort of the dynamics of how markets adjust.

15
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:33,720
So we had a change that occurred, a shift out in demand, and we saw that in a very short run crisis,

16
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:39,600
but quantities wouldn't change, so price would surface sort of rational sales quantity,

17
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:47,820
which was fixed in the short run to consumers according to their willingness to pay for it, and that in the short run,

18
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:57,509
existing firms in the industry could begin to respond to that change in price by changing their variable inputs to increase quantity.

19
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:03,420
So shift of the demand is going to raise the price. It's going to start to signal firms that are already in that industry.

20
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:07,050
You know, hey, you ought to produce a little more than it was yesterday.

21
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:11,130
You get a higher price for it so you can raise your profits by producing more.

22
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:17,549
And then that also begins to signal firms that are already in the industry that maybe their

23
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:21,720
profit opportunities here might be worth your while considering entering the Sigma Street.

24
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:26,280
So in a perfectly competitive market, long run, there be no barriers to entry.

25
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:32,640
So if I wanted to enter this industry, it might take me some time to ramp up to do that.

26
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:38,160
But eventually I could overcome those barriers and I could enter that industry if I thought it was profitable to do so.

27
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:47,400
So it was sort of a quote that I'll let you read that sort of if you really sort of encapsulates that dynamic quite well.

28
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:05,410
So the early mover in the industry was able to make profits for a period of time.

29
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:11,530
Those profits, though, were observable to others in his community who also could have done that.

30
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:16,840
And there wasn't a lot of capital involved. It wasn't very complicated technology.

31
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:26,170
So it didn't take all that long for there to be 20 competing firms in that industry, and the profits got competed away.

32
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:33,189
That's basically the exact dynamics that we were talking about. Okay.

33
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:37,420
Now, finally, on the last day of class, we get to the most favorite famous graph in economics.

34
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:43,750
Took us a while to get here, didn't this? But yet here we are, market equilibrium.

35
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,160
So we've got a supply curve, demand curve.

36
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:54,519
And then we find that there's one intersection point to other is there's one unique price at which the quantity

37
00:03:54,520 --> 00:04:01,240
consumers are willing to demand versus aggregate market demand is exactly equal to the quantity firms.

38
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:05,740
This is aggregate supply are willing to actually produce and deliver to market.

39
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:10,210
Suppose the price were higher than the equilibrium price of the star.

40
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:25,730
The very high price of sending a signal to both sides of the market.

41
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:31,460
It's sending firms a signal that, wow, you can make a lot of money, produce a lot of this product.

42
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:35,870
Q H for q high.

43
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:45,260
The problem is it's sending the opposite signal to consumers that high price above the equilibrium price is going to send a signal to consumers that,

44
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:51,530
well, this is really expensive. You're going to have to give up a lot of other goods to get another unit of this.

45
00:04:51,770 --> 00:05:02,890
You really want to cut back. So that kind of explains in a sense why it can't be an equilibrium price.

46
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,660
It's sending signals to both sides of the market.

47
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:12,790
The problem is it's sending inconsistent signals that when both sides of the market respond to those signals is.

48
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:20,440
Be in a situation with a big excess supply of the products.

49
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:25,060
Now, you can imagine the product we used last time as our example was fish.

50
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:32,950
If there's a lot of fish sitting around, what happens to it? Not a situation anybody wants.

51
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:37,660
Absolutely not. So if we were in that situation.

52
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:44,950
They'll be a pretty powerful force to cut prices. Consumers would say, well, wait a second,

53
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:52,120
why am I going to pay per pound of fish when the markets are overflowing with it and nobody's here in line waiting to get it?

54
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:59,750
The markets are going to say, well, wait a second, why are we going to supply that much fish if nobody's here to buy it?

55
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:08,080
So there's a powerful force then to decrease prices once we hit the equilibrium of price of star.

56
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:09,579
At that point,

57
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:17,559
there would be no reason for any further change to happen unless some other thing happened that would shift the demand curve or supply curve further.

58
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:21,860
But as long as this is the demand curve and this is a supply curve. Once we had p star.

59
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:31,600
Think of equilibrium for like a chemistry class. Equilibrium means when things are in balance, there's no reason for anything to change.

60
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:37,850
Conversely, if we had a very low price. Lower the p star.

61
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:45,380
Again, we have inconsistent signals being sent. Consumers are getting a signal, hey, this product is cheap.

62
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:51,199
There's a low opportunity cost in terms of other things. You'd have to forgo buying in order to get another unit.

63
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,620
Go buy a lot of this and firms that get the opposite.

64
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:58,850
The signal is product is cheap, it's not very profitable, don't produce very much.

65
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:07,670
So now we have the opposite dynamic. We have the fish market is almost got bear cape bear refrigerator cases.

66
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:12,220
Nothing's in there. And there's a line outside, you know,

67
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:19,460
we create them the opposite dynamic for a price change so that excess demand would end up being eliminated as price rises.

68
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:27,249
And so what can change an equilibrium? So either the demand would shift or supply would shift.

69
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:30,309
So let's go way back to the first month of the class.

70
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:35,020
What are the things that shifted? Demand curves, the consumer's income changed,

71
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:44,710
which is a normal good and income rose demand and shipped out fish is an inferior good and income rose demand would shift and prices of other goods.

72
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:51,759
Let's say beef became more expensive. It was substitute to fish shift.

73
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:55,050
The demand curve for fish out for preferences could change.

74
00:07:55,750 --> 00:08:00,820
So over time you might find a fish is even healthier than we thought it was.

75
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:06,920
So everybody wants to have salmon. Okay.

76
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:13,340
Well, could change the supply curve. So all the things that underlie the marginal cost curves of the firms in the industry,

77
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:17,060
they're on the supply curve, really just sort of reflects the marginal cost curves.

78
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:22,660
So if input prices go up or marginal cost of production would rise.

79
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:28,900
Supply curve, cars show up and back the craft component.

80
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:31,950
What if technology changed?

81
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:40,680
We've developed more efficient ways of fishing that would shift the supply curve out to the lower the marginal cost of production for firms.

82
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:48,660
So many of those things happen that we would see one of the curves shift and then we would have to move to a new equilibrium price.

83
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:55,320
So suppose the technology of fishing became more efficient.

84
00:08:57,170 --> 00:09:01,240
Now shift the supply curve out is firms marginal costs would fall.

85
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:04,100
So at any given price, firms would want to produce more.

86
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:11,180
So if all the individual firms would say, Hey, now producing fish is cheaper at any given price, I want to produce more pounds of fish.

87
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:17,780
And I used to. That means the market supply curve is going to shift out because every individual firms supply is going to increase.

88
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,440
So what's going to happen to price and quantity?

89
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:30,320
That's actually going to depend not just on that shift in supply, but it's going to depend on the elasticity of demand and supply.

90
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,520
Demand was very elastic, very price. Elastic is a fairly flat demand curve.

91
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:44,390
So go back to way back to demand elasticity. Elastic demand is that a decrease in price yields a more than proportionate increase in quantity.

92
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:51,290
In other words, if price even fell by a little bit, consumers would be willing to buy a lot more.

93
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:56,629
So we would see that the useful Librium would feature a lower price and higher fluidity.

94
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,640
But most of the change would be in quantity.

95
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:05,960
If demand is very elastic, price doesn't have to fall very much to tempt the consumers to buy a lot more fish.

96
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:13,980
Conversely, if the price demanded by price elasticity demand was a lot less, a lot less elastic or a steeper demand curve,

97
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:24,090
we would still get the new equilibrium having a lower price in a higher quantity, but there would be a bigger impact on price with inelastic demand.

98
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:29,490
Price would have to drop quite a lot in terms of consumers to buy even a little bit more.

99
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:35,649
So the ultimate change in price and quantity depends not just on the show, on the curve.

100
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:40,720
The shifters so depend on the shape, the elasticity of the curve that didn't shift.

101
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:50,160
You can kind of see the same thing if it's demand that shifts. Let's say demand shifts out.

102
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:56,790
We're going to get a higher price and a higher quantity. So that occurs either way.

103
00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:01,770
Look how big the changes are relative to each other. Depends on the elasticity of supply.

104
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:05,460
Supply curve is very steep, not very price elastic.

105
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:10,140
In other words, if it takes a much higher price to convince firms to produce even a little bit more,

106
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:15,120
you're going to get a big increase in price and a small increase in the price spot.

107
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:21,300
So demand shift. Same demand shift occurs with a much more price elastic supply curve.

108
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:26,880
It doesn't take much of an increase in price to convince firms that it's profitable to produce a lot more.

109
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:31,380
So the new equilibrium will again have a higher price and higher quantity.

110
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:35,280
But the effect is going to be much bigger on quantity than on price.

111
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:43,200
The that combined those last two slides, it sort of leaves you with the bottom line that even if only one curve shifts,

112
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:48,930
you obviously need to know about the shape that is the elasticity of the other curve to predict whether

113
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:58,260
that shift is going to yield relatively big price change or a relatively big quantity change makes sense.

114
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:08,370
So for the inelastic supply one, because they're not able to increase their supply production quickly,

115
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:12,930
that's why an increase in demand is going to raise price more than quantity.

116
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:16,380
Right. So the firm's marginal cost curves would be very steep.

117
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:22,380
So in other words, if there is a situation where rate raising your quantity would cost you a lot more,

118
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:27,060
so maybe there's a big decreasing returns to scale on the industry.

119
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:36,040
So it really depends on the cost curve to the firms look like. Okay.

120
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:43,410
So what I promised last time is we were going to argue whether or not there's anything good about the equilibrium in a perfectly competitive market.

121
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:50,010
So we're going to kind of interpret the supply curve as sort of a social marginal cost curve.

122
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:56,070
We mean by that all the supply curve is a sort of some of the marginal cost curves of the firms and the

123
00:12:56,070 --> 00:13:03,060
industry is the individual firms supply curve is the upward slope and part of its marginal cost curve.

124
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:12,830
With prices at least high enough that it's worth being in business. So the individual firms supply curve directly reflects their marginal costs.

125
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:16,820
And then the industry supply is just the aggregation of all these.

126
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:26,090
So like sort of the marginal cost of the inputs that some firm in society is using to produce this product, to produce another unit of that product.

127
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:29,990
So it kind of tells us from an opportunity cost perspective,

128
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:37,520
how many more of society's productive inputs do we have to allocate to this industry in order to produce another unit of output?

129
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:47,210
The demand curve we can now very readily go back and interpret as a marginal benefit curve.

130
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:53,160
So the individual demand curve reflects how much they'd be willing to pay to get one more unit.

131
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:58,459
So as it move down that demand curve from where the ice cream cone effect layback.

132
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:04,390
Now the more units I have of something, probably the less I'm going to value an additional unit.

133
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:08,720
All the market demand is is the aggregation of all those individual demands.

134
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:14,870
Of the individual demands reflect how much some consumer is willing to pay for some unit of that product.

135
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:20,360
Then sort of an aggregate or societal level. The aggregate demand curve also reflects at every point.

136
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:24,589
There traces back to some consumer making a decision that, yes,

137
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:30,770
it's worth another it's worth the dollars for me to get another unit of this good with $2 to get home.

138
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:38,570
So if we're at the equilibrium of the point where supply equals demand,

139
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:44,959
that means we're at a point where the marginal cost to society of the inputs that had to be used to

140
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:51,740
produce that unit is exactly equal to the value to some consumer in society of getting that unit.

141
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:03,860
What if we weren't at the equilibrium price? Suppose we have a price control.

142
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:09,960
APL should be up here. Sorry. It's like typhoid, not death.

143
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:17,990
People should be there and at The Intercept. So those they have a price control says it's illegal to charge more than people for this product.

144
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:23,440
Now we've got a situation where, again, we've got the wrong signals being sent,

145
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,890
or at least inconsistent signals being sent to the two sides of the market.

146
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:35,200
Producers would get a signal that you can't make very much money in this industry, you don't want to produce very much.

147
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:43,719
So they're only going to produce a couple units of the product. Consumers are going to get a signal, Hey, this is really cheap.

148
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:52,570
You want a lot of it at that controlled price appeal, they'd want to buy you a high quantity.

149
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:56,890
So we have excess demand. How much is actually going to be produced and sold?

150
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:05,720
Under this price control. It's less cool.

151
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:12,950
So quantity is going to be driven by what we call the short side of the market, the market side of the market that supplies or demands the least.

152
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:17,410
So you can't sell more of the cool.

153
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:22,790
And so even if you produce huge, you just sit there. So firms are going to figure that out.

154
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:26,660
If it's price control and if it's strictly enforced and there's no way to get around it,

155
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:34,640
firms are really not going to produce because all that extra product will just be sitting there and they wouldn't be able to sell it.

156
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:47,920
So let's look at those units between QOL and the equilibrium price of equilibrium quantity of Q Star.

157
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:54,880
Okay, part of the demand curve that I shaded there that says, how much are those extra units worth to consumers?

158
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:59,840
The most valuable units to consumers will already be produced.

159
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:08,719
That's these up here. But all of these units are still quite valuable to consumers, and in fact,

160
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:15,290
they're more valuable than the marginal cost of the inputs that would have had to been devoted to that industry to produce them.

161
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:28,020
So we can think of the area as a triangle, sort of dead weight loss or welfare loss there changeable terms.

162
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:35,910
From the price control. Price control causes quantity to fall below the equilibrium quantity.

163
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:39,260
And as a society, what are we losing? Because of that?

164
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:46,920
We're losing this excess value that could have been created. An unregulated market would have produced this many more units.

165
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:55,250
And those and those additional units would have created sort of a net social surplus, I think, about that way.

166
00:17:55,700 --> 00:18:00,589
Of an area equal to that triangle because the value of those units to consumers

167
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:06,230
exceeded the marginal cost to producers of the inputs they had to use by that much.

168
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:12,890
Now, what if we eliminate this price control, say, well, just let the market operate.

169
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:18,050
So then we're going to get to you, star and Q Star.

170
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:22,820
You see, all those units will be produced and then we stop.

171
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:30,410
We don't produce more than that. If we produce more, we'd be producing extra units or worth, say only this much to consumers.

172
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:38,630
Suppose we produce all the way to wage, but they cost even more than that value to produce.

173
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:44,160
So we wouldn't want those produced. There were something to consumers,

174
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:50,940
but they're worth less than the opportunity cost of the inputs that would have to be added to it to this industry to produce them.

175
00:18:53,330 --> 00:19:00,469
So essentially stopping right here is optimal accu star.

176
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:03,980
We get every single unit produce that has this characteristic.

177
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:07,969
It's worth more to the consumer who gets it than the marginal cost of the inputs.

178
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:16,160
So we're used to produce it. In other words, there's some surplus being created and we get no units where the opposite is true,

179
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:20,240
where the value to consumers is less than the marginal cost of the inputs.

180
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:26,960
So that's why we're kind of using as perfectly competitive market as a benchmark.

181
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:37,400
So if we if we meet all these assumptions of a perfectly competitive market and we get to this equilibrium, we actually can't do better.

182
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:48,100
So. It's come back to those assumptions.

183
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:55,870
In large number of terms. Suppose that was violated.

184
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:06,440
That was violated. Let's say it's violated in the most radical possible way.

185
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:10,150
There's only one firm in the industry instead of a large number.

186
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:12,070
It's literally one. We'd have a monopoly.

187
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:21,380
If there are multiple firms but not enough to be large, we'd be in a situation that economists call oligopoly.

188
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:27,140
So there's a handful of firms two, three, five, ten.

189
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:31,550
But each one of them is big enough that they're not going to behave as a price taker.

190
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:38,930
So it's also related to condition two that every firm has to be small.

191
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:45,260
If we had one big firm and then a billion little firms was billion little firms would be price takers.

192
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:48,139
But the one big firm wouldn't be if it increased its quantity.

193
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:52,490
That would not that would be non-negligible relative to the market and it would change price.

194
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,830
So again, we being an oligopoly situation. Okay, same product.

195
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:05,330
So we talked about wheat. Nobody cares who which farmers wheat goes in their bread that they bought at the store this week.

196
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:13,170
Doesn't matter. It's all the same to you. The flower from Farmer Jones's wheat is the same as the flower from Farmer Smith.

197
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:21,480
Sweet. You know what? If products are differentiated, differentiated, meaning they differ in some respect that matters to consumers.

198
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:28,290
And that would change the market a bit. It's like a pizza in Ann Arbor.

199
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:34,400
What are some. Attributes of different pizza places in Ann Arbor that you care about.

200
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:40,020
So that's different than the other one. And for some reason that matters to me.

201
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:47,750
Price being big price quality, the location.

202
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:53,630
So you live in Ann Arbor is pretty big. You live in a particular place in Ann Arbor.

203
00:21:54,140 --> 00:22:00,030
So even if it's to Domino's Pizza, so the pizza is identical, but one of them is a block from your house.

204
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:03,800
The other one's two miles from your house. You have a preference for a block from your house.

205
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:08,390
What about the crust? The sauce. She's good.

206
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:12,440
Yeah, it tastes good. Does it? And your opinion might be different than mine.

207
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:15,920
Your favorite pizza might be one pizza, and my favorite might be another.

208
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:19,399
And again, it doesn't make you right or me wrong. We're both right for ourselves.

209
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:23,900
But the important part. Part is we don't view them as their exchangeable parts.

210
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:29,290
You like the one you like better? I like the one I like better. You like the one that's close to your house?

211
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:39,410
I like the ones close to my house because of convenience. So what we would get is a situation called, paradoxically, monopolistic competition.

212
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:45,980
The monopolistic part is that every pizza place in Ann Arbor has some unique aspect to it.

213
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:51,350
There's nobody else that makes my pizza at my location.

214
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:59,330
So essentially, I have a Ford Monopoly on Domino's Pizza at the corner of Main and whatever.

215
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:12,370
The competition part is just the fact that I have that monopoly on my pizza and my location doesn't protect me from entry of very close substitutes.

216
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:21,910
Each product is unique, but you can still get a lot of entry by competing products that are close substitutes.

217
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:27,730
So if I'm making an awful lot of profit in my location, somebody else is going to figure that out and say,

218
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:35,050
Hey, maybe I ought to open a pizza place in Ann Arbor. It will be in a slightly different location and the ingredients will be a little different.

219
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:38,410
If it's an eating place, maybe the ambiance will be a little different.

220
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:44,960
But eventually we're going to get a lot of pizza places in Ann Arbor entering as this is a very profitable thing to do.

221
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:49,790
So we still have competition, but it's not for an identical product.

222
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:55,910
We also have barriers to entry and we'll talk about that a little bit later.

223
00:23:56,570 --> 00:24:00,889
What would you consider something like these, these oil producing countries,

224
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:07,310
that countries would that be an oligopoly or how where were they that would fall?

225
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:15,020
That would definitely fall in the oligopoly. So oil is a little it's kind of interesting because there's also some collusion.

226
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:21,590
Yeah. So you've got OPEC. So basically the oil producing and exporting countries, that's not every oil producer in the world.

227
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:30,290
The United States is not part of all pack. And we're a big oil producer, but there are a lot of oil producers that try to coordinate their production.

228
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:36,690
They try to say, you know, hey, let's cut a deal that we're all going to cut our output by 10% to raise the price of oil.

229
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:44,000
We're all and they're big enough as a group so that that quantity decision, if nobody cheats on it.

230
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:48,810
I say, Oh, the price is really high. I'm going to overproduce what I promised I was going to do.

231
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:53,190
But if we all maintain that, that's going to raise the price.

232
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,710
It's still not monopoly because there are countries like the US that produce oil that are not part of pack.

233
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,830
So you've got a handful of big producers,

234
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:08,040
each one of which is big enough that its production decisions are is going to influence the market price of oil.

235
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:11,130
So it's definitely an oligopoly type situation.

236
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:21,240
Would only be monopoly if there was just one producer or if Oldpark included all oil producers and its agreements were completely enforceable.

237
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:27,210
Nobody ever cheated on that. And the reason I'm asking is because I'm trying to distinguish that from a competitive monopoly,

238
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:37,800
where you have this collusion type group control ratio for countries versus it's more because oil is sort of more of a commodity.

239
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:43,920
Now, granted, there are different grades of oil, but within a grade, a lot of commodity within with a grain of oil.

240
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:47,700
I don't care, you know, as a as a consumer and driving my car,

241
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:52,290
I don't care if the gas in my car was made from a gallon of oil that came from

242
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:56,850
this country or that country or from this oil company or that oil company.

243
00:25:57,570 --> 00:26:04,060
You know, it's the. It's an 87 octane gas from you know, it's all the same to me.

244
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:11,240
So that's more like weird in the sense that at least within grades of oil, it's a commodity.

245
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:14,680
I don't know. It doesn't matter to the consumers who choose it elsewhere.

246
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,400
It's the pizza.

247
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:22,900
You know, you have a preference based on where you live and where the pizza places are located, what your tastes are for, the way they make the pizza.

248
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,470
They're definitely not they're definitely not, you know,

249
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:34,750
identical products to you in the same way that I don't really care where the oil comes from in my car that comes from it.

250
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:41,150
Do you think Chevron branded gas stations took a hit after their oil spill?

251
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:52,650
A bit. I mean, if you go back if you go back further, if a really big oil spill is the Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska,

252
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:59,260
and that was probably in the 19 late 1980s, that was historically the really big one.

253
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:02,790
And Exxon definitely took a hit there for at least a period of time.

254
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:10,480
Some consumers cared about the brand. So used to think Exxon, BP, Mobile, Amoco, all that was up were perfect substitutes.

255
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:15,130
I'm going to buy the cheapest and most convenient one and I couldn't care less which one goes in my car.

256
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:22,450
But at least for a period of time, some consumers said, no, I'm going to go to I have a preference for BP over Exxon,

257
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:26,230
because Exxon just destroyed the environment of Alaska with this big spill.

258
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:31,080
And. That's not long ago. History and not the genocide anymore.

259
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:35,430
They were. I forgot about that one I was before my time was actually your time.

260
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:41,970
But that was that was a really big one. That's the one where there was a there was a period of time that was a big a big hit.

261
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:50,010
And, of course, some people were fired or the Exxon gas station franchisees who had nothing to do with the spill.

262
00:27:51,660 --> 00:28:00,380
I was just going to say they ended up being the largest company in the world until, you know, mid 2000s still after the accident.

263
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:03,660
Yeah. So it wasn't a lasting effect.

264
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:08,190
Right. So we also had barriers to entry.

265
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:15,060
So the long run, we assume there are no barriers to entry. We have barriers to entry that persist in the long run.

266
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:18,510
So we may have an anomaly or situation.

267
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:35,490
I was. Since.

268
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:40,860
And now what can we do about various market failures?

269
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:45,220
The market failures you talked about here are mostly about failures of competition.

270
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:49,400
And there are other types of market failures to talk about more next semester.

271
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:56,809
Externalities, public goods. So various other assumptions for the perfectly competitive market to the ideal is that

272
00:28:56,810 --> 00:29:02,030
in fact the costs and benefits of production reflect all of the costs of benefits.

273
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:02,980
If we have, say,

274
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:09,650
a polluting industry and firms don't have to pay for the costs of that damage and therefore it doesn't go into the price consumers have to pay,

275
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:13,370
then that perfect, even if as a perfectly competitive market,

276
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:18,649
we wouldn't say it was socially ideal because we get too much of the polluting good because the

277
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:23,450
industry has no incentive to account for the costs that are being imposed on third parties.

278
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:27,170
Say asthma. Extra asthma visits to ERs.

279
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:35,300
So there are a whole variety of market failures. The ones we've kind of talked about so far today are mostly failures of competition.

280
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:49,819
So what can be done to fix the various market failures? So we talked a lot about this in this course about consumer values in terms of information and

281
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:55,430
health care information is sort of a scarce commodity that makes it hard to make good decisions.

282
00:29:56,420 --> 00:30:01,670
So that's a different set of market failures that would reflect sort of the demand side of the market.

283
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:11,900
What can we do to sort of fill that information gap? So there have been two big sets of initiatives price transparency and quality report cards.

284
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:18,350
If we think people don't make good decisions of health care, partly because it's hard for them to figure out what prices are going to be,

285
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:24,320
and it's hard for them to figure out what different providers quality levels are.

286
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:28,250
We can try to fill those information gaps through various policies.

287
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:34,280
So health care is really the only thing that we buy without knowing what it's going to cost us.

288
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:45,530
None of us would go to say, Well, I want to get a new car. I'm going to go to the car dealer and I'll pick that nice blue one over there.

289
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:52,700
Shake hands with the salesperson. Drive activity's, drive off.

290
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:53,750
Sign the contract.

291
00:30:54,080 --> 00:31:01,640
Under the terms that the car dealership is going to send me a bill a month from now, they're going to fill in the price at that time.

292
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:09,510
And I'm legally obligated to pay whatever price they filled in. You drive an awful lot with that car through those terms.

293
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:14,650
Oh, [INAUDIBLE], no. Oh, [INAUDIBLE]. Well, that's how we buy health care.

294
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:20,010
So it's the only thing we buy that we buy before we know what it's going to cost us.

295
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:27,389
We've talked about many reasons hard to shop on price and therefore on the supply side of the market,

296
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:30,300
that's going to reduce producers incentive to compete on price.

297
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:37,200
If people don't shop on price, I don't have that powerful competitive incentive to if I don't lower my price,

298
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:44,320
I'm going to lose my customers to somebody who does. You know, we get surprise billing situations.

299
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:47,950
There's obviously some legislation on that in 2020,

300
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:55,300
and that's one of the 1% steps that some of you wrote on the equality report cards

301
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:59,560
can different difficult to assess quality of the different providers in the market.

302
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:03,310
It requires some really sophisticated knowledge.

303
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:11,489
To assess that yourself. And you also have to take into account, well, if the outcomes are different,

304
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:20,730
is that because the care is different or because the case mix that the different providers cared for was different and you two risk adjust for that.

305
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:25,830
Okay. So price transparency now what is the big picture goals?

306
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:33,660
So as well, not everything in health care is shoppable. If I'm having heart attack symptoms, I'm not shopping for care.

307
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:44,240
But some things are imaging studies. We talk about MRI's lab tests, primary care, obstetric care, planned procedures,

308
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:49,580
things where I can in principle get some information about alternative providers.

309
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:57,399
I have some time to make my decision where I'm going to go. We saw big increases in cost sharing.

310
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:01,340
We saw deductibles have really skyrocketed over the past 15 years or so.

311
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:11,210
So that increases the incentive for price shock. So we wanted that inform or facilitate sort of informed decision making.

312
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:17,210
And then if people are good shoppers, that's going to reduce their out-of-pocket price and it's going to reduce total health care spending.

313
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:25,150
So how well do we do there? It's still really hard to get accurate information.

314
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:32,350
So I kind of suggest you do two things. One is for some state governments that have developed price shopping tools.

315
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:40,569
Select the one from New Hampshire. Play around with that, see your help, figure out how easy it is to get information that you,

316
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:44,920
if you were looking for that procedure, would consider sort of good, actionable information.

317
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:51,370
And then also go to some hospitals websites and look at the price data that they're required to report under federal law.

318
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:55,390
How usable and actionable do you feel that information is?

319
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:03,059
So here's the disappointing results so far. Just an example.

320
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:08,370
I have to shop for a procedure at Michigan Medicine that my insurance would not have covered.

321
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:15,240
And I had to have the portal. I had to have a log in and everything in order to find that information.

322
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:22,170
I'm trying to think if I didn't, I wasn't an established patient, I would not be able to find that information.

323
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:27,129
So that's I guess another wouldn't even have known how to get it or you would have had to jump through at who.

324
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:29,610
We've now we've got to set up a portal and a whole nother provider.

325
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:36,450
I've got portals at three other wouldn't let you forget this information and that's a good example.

326
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:42,060
So little evidence. The price transparency efforts so far have been impactful.

327
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:50,460
Generally the tools aren't used very much, and even when they're used, they don't really seem to change shopping very much.

328
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,110
So limited success. And then can I ask,

329
00:34:54,180 --> 00:35:00,750
is that because of lack of awareness of the availability of the tools to help you shop on price or the fact that even if you're aware of it,

330
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:02,670
either you don't use it or they're not useful.

331
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:10,049
And there is some evidence against the New Hampshire where they did a big sort of outreach campaign to market the price shopping tool,

332
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:18,600
and it did succeed in substantially increasing its use, but it actually didn't translate into higher choice of low cost providers.

333
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:25,679
So in that case, it seemed to be even when the awareness problem was somewhat fixed, it didn't really change the shopping problem.

334
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:32,159
So it wasn't just awareness of the availability, the information that they figure out, the other things that contributed to that.

335
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:37,139
I lived in New Hampshire and undergrad, so I think everything is like pretty isolated.

336
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:45,240
So I feel like it's not like it's not like a metropolitan area where you can just like take from a bunch of different available providers.

337
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:49,469
You know, you Hampshire might not be the, the best place for shopping just because of geography.

338
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:55,770
Yeah. All these little towns that in the winter it takes a long time from get to get from one to another.

339
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:03,030
We did this exercise in health systems and it's the clearly they're not very useful and it's hard because

340
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:07,469
you may have a different insurance plan and things like that and it's hard to figure out the exact price.

341
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:14,760
But are there any most of them have been driven by CMS data or by states or by a specific insurer, which kind of limits their usefulness.

342
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:19,200
Are there any commercial entities that try to integrate information from a number of different?

343
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:26,559
Platforms to bring them together and say, this is what you may pay for a close estimate of what you may pay depending on this.

344
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:30,430
And they don't remember the name of it, but there is at least one that has tried to do that.

345
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:36,000
And I don't know how far they've gotten that they weren't too far a couple of years ago.

346
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:43,490
I can't remember the name. Okay, thanks. So one thing that has kind of worked is reference pricing.

347
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:50,870
So reference pricing is when we've got different providers for a shoppable

348
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:55,700
service that have tremendously different prices in the same geographic area.

349
00:36:57,330 --> 00:37:02,680
In California, for example, there are public health insurance program said this is crazy.

350
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:12,780
We are paying for the same joint replacement, anywhere from 12000 to $75000, depending on where our employees decide to go get care.

351
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:21,810
So we're going to do is we're going to set some cap on the price base somewhere around the median price, for example.

352
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:27,240
Median, the distribution side will pay up to $30,000.

353
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:31,920
So 30,000 was roughly the median and that's what they set as the reference price.

354
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:38,880
So what happened very quickly is that the hospitals that were charging way above that dropped

355
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:44,650
their prices because they would have lost all of the California state employees business.

356
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:48,150
So they dropped the prices to the state employees insurance plan.

357
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:58,589
So we had seven and four years went from 46 that were at or below the reference price to 72 hospitals and generated just for this one procedure,

358
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:06,900
$2.8 million in savings to this one health plan in the two year period of service has to be shoppable.

359
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:11,190
What I have of have referenced prices for heart attack care because again,

360
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:16,890
why why if I'm the $75,000 hospital, why would I cut my price for a heart attack here?

361
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,870
Because if the enrollee shows up,

362
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:24,630
they're not going to know that I'm the expensive hospital will be able to act on that because they're having heart attack.

363
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:31,020
So you can do it for things like joint replacements where they're not emergencies and people can shop around.

364
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:36,540
And obviously, you have to be very careful if you're healthy about informing people about this because you don't

365
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:41,640
want people to sort of not just I didn't know about it and I went to the $75,000 hospital.

366
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:48,930
So you have to be very proactive when somebody is getting approved for a joint replacement to say, hey, this is the way it works.

367
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:53,459
You know, here's a list of hospitals that are at or below the reference price.

368
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:59,520
You're welcome to go to any others, but understand you're going to have to pay the full cost above 35%, above $30,000.

369
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:06,060
So if that hospital still charge 75 and you nonetheless chose them, you'd have a $45,000 co-pay.

370
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:11,700
So you better inform your enrollees about that so they don't get surprised.

371
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:21,580
Okay. Quality report cards. So standardized tools used to rate providers select some measurable outcomes.

372
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:29,160
Hopefully, there are outcomes that are important outcomes, even maybe validated by research as being so as the metrics are valid,

373
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:32,850
and that if risk adjustment is important, hopefully the risk adjusted.

374
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:37,260
If you've got multiple measures, you probably want to combine them in some way.

375
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:42,660
So CMS compare sites have taken these raw measure scores and combined them into star ratings.

376
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,810
So here's a screenshot from Nursing Home Compare.

377
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:55,150
So I put in a zip code around here and Harvard shows me the locations of all of the nursing homes in the area.

378
00:39:55,170 --> 00:40:00,659
So I can click on them individually and search on them and say, Well,

379
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:09,120
your Regency at Love's Park is a five star nursing home and Glacier Hills, which does not have a good reputation as a three star nursing home.

380
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:17,570
So there are some who will face validity there. Do these work.

381
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:21,290
So price transparency so far hasn't really worked very well.

382
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:29,690
All your report cards are worth a little bit better. They could improve quality if they drive demand to better providers.

383
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:32,989
So that means not only are more people getting care from better providers,

384
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:36,830
but those that are losing market share have an incentive to improve their care

385
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:40,250
so that their star rating goes up and they don't lose sales in the future.

386
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:47,569
And generally, in a variety of settings, they've been modestly effective, haven't been sort of game changers.

387
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:48,430
But, you know,

388
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:56,390
some volume has been driven to higher quality providers and there's been some impetus to increase quality from those that have lower scores.

389
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:03,080
It might be from that direct incentive of patient volume, it might be from more of an intrinsic motivation.

390
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:09,770
Providers don't like to look bad. They have pride of study of surgeons in Pennsylvania.

391
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:17,570
So they actually responded more to just how do they compare to their peers than the actual but true change in patient volume.

392
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:24,560
You know, I don't want to be a one star surgeon going to the surgical meetings and people will laugh at me.

393
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:33,469
And in fact, patients who chose better rank nursing homes could achieve better outcomes,

394
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:36,410
which sort of gives some validation to the measures as being important.

395
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:46,900
There are also some potential unintended consequences when STAR ratings came out for nursing homes.

396
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:53,560
Higher rated homes were able to raise their prices about 5 to 6% more than poorly rated homes.

397
00:41:56,110 --> 00:42:00,070
That's work that I did with a former doctoral student, Shawn Lon, who's a Georgetown.

398
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:06,610
So that could also limit access to higher quality facilities, partly as a market work in a way it should hire.

399
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:12,910
We would hope that higher quality providers could get higher prices because that's an incentive to deliver high quality.

400
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:17,530
But it also has sort of an unintended consequence of it may limit access.

401
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:23,800
In particular, nursing homes have both privately paying patients and they their Medicaid patients.

402
00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:29,470
And a lot of nursing homes, particularly good ones, tend to be pretty full.

403
00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:37,500
So the private patients might be getting into those homes and other fund raisers,

404
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:42,450
five star and are identifiable as high quality and then their beds not available for Medicaid patients.

405
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:54,780
So a side effect of might be that some increase in disparities. I'm kind of leave you to sort of look at this a little bit more on your own.

406
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:59,520
But basically, we've got all of these different payment mechanisms starting at the top, traditional fee for service.

407
00:42:59,970 --> 00:43:08,280
And then as we're going down, we're getting sort of more and more into alternative payment mechanisms.

408
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:11,759
So value based payment is still generally fee for service,

409
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:19,050
but there's some adjustment for quality or value or some other metric besides the number of units delivered

410
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:25,020
deliver alternative payment models where providers begin to take on some level of financial risk.

411
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:34,110
Accountable care organizations. We've got sort of shared savings and shared risks to like full capitation reform, but we're completely at risk.

412
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:39,569
You get a fixed amount for that episode of care, or if you're an insurer that's capitated,

413
00:43:39,570 --> 00:43:45,299
you get a fixed amount of premium to take care of that patient for a year. And if you spent more than that, you lose money.

414
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:52,830
If you spend less than that, you keep the money. So it's sort of increasingly powerful incentives moving away from fee for service.

415
00:43:54,880 --> 00:44:05,620
A lot of provide a lot of these payment systems are already in place overall and less than 40% in 2018 of payment was

416
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:12,130
sort of not was I'm sure fee for service not linked to any metric of value or quality is just linked to quantity.

417
00:44:14,930 --> 00:44:19,490
It varied quite a lot by payer. Medicare is sort of the the leading mover in this.

418
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:28,370
Only about 10% of Medicare payments had literally no link to any type of measure of quality or value.

419
00:44:31,390 --> 00:44:35,440
Medicaid is sort of a laggard. And that's and commercial is also a laggard.

420
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:39,460
66% of Medicaid, 55% of commercial.

421
00:44:40,510 --> 00:44:50,540
We're still kind of strained fee for service. Kind of also lets you look over the some of your more detail,

422
00:44:50,550 --> 00:45:03,680
but why would Medicaid go so far behind what Medicare is doing if they're under the same governmental organization really like it, like CMS?

423
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:06,950
Why wouldn't they implement? Good question.

424
00:45:06,950 --> 00:45:10,790
Why CMS hasn't sort of pushed Medicaid to do that more?

425
00:45:10,790 --> 00:45:14,239
Because it's really set at the state level.

426
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:22,310
It's the costs are shared between federal and state, but subject to being being within state guidelines for how the program is run.

427
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:26,390
It's the states that really make these decisions that make sense.

428
00:45:26,510 --> 00:45:32,750
Now, you know, Medicare, the question is, what do they have the statutory, statutory authority to do?

429
00:45:33,110 --> 00:45:40,400
They could try to make requirements for the states and say, hey, if you don't do this, you're out of compliance.

430
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:47,230
But they might need more statutory authority. I'm not not enough of an expert to know what you know within current statute.

431
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:55,580
What regulatory authority would they have to push the states to move away from sort of a straight fee for service already having issues,

432
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:59,600
just having everybody expand it, period, let alone be able to control.

433
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:07,170
So kind of the overall evidence is that these things work a little bit.

434
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:14,850
They sort of haven't been sort of game changers yet. A lot of them have been sort of modestly effective, kind of like the quality report cards.

435
00:46:17,010 --> 00:46:18,000
Where do we go from here?

436
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:26,680
So some of the objectives that the Centers for, etc., for Medicare and Medicaid innovation has laid out are streamlined coordinate between models.

437
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:32,700
There's a lot of confusing models right now. You know, you could be an area that's got five different models going on.

438
00:46:34,090 --> 00:46:35,760
Know which one do I want to participate in?

439
00:46:35,790 --> 00:46:43,860
A lot of them are voluntary, so they want to expand the number of participants in the voluntary models, but also shift towards more mandatory models,

440
00:46:45,690 --> 00:46:51,000
voluntary models of sort of a selection bias question the people who participate or the people who think they're to do well at.

441
00:46:54,330 --> 00:46:58,889
And they also want to move from models that have upside only, in other words, shared savings.

442
00:46:58,890 --> 00:47:03,450
So you get a reward for coming in under a target on spending, but no shared risk.

443
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:08,549
You don't get penalized for coming in over target. So they want to move more from those one sided upside.

444
00:47:08,550 --> 00:47:18,820
All the models to two sided models with providers bear risk and also a big increase in focus on equity in terms of both measuring outcomes and

445
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:27,510
for some populations and having explicit metrics for equity and disparities be part of the metrics that are in payments or adjusted for it.

446
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:32,070
So those are my big objectives for the next ten years.

447
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:38,710
We've got a lot of challenges. Providers are paid a lot of different ways.

448
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:43,889
I could have a patient. I could be paid 20 different ways from all the different commercial insurers.

449
00:47:43,890 --> 00:47:47,830
The Medicaid program, the Medicare program, the Medicare Advantage.

450
00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:53,250
Medicare Advantage plans I participate with. You know, I could have 20 different payment mechanisms.

451
00:47:54,510 --> 00:47:59,880
Am I going to sit there and say, well, for this patient, I want to do this because the incentive is that in for that patient, I want to do it.

452
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:02,130
It's crazy. You can't do that.

453
00:48:04,050 --> 00:48:12,300
It's obviously a lot of administrative complexity and we want to align setups of providers and patients, not just focus on one side or the other.

454
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:19,800
We found that just giving just putting people in high deductible health plans, giving them the incentive to shop really hasn't helped.

455
00:48:20,990 --> 00:48:27,410
It's reduced spending somewhat, but it's caused people to cut back on valuable care as well as low valued value here.

456
00:48:27,950 --> 00:48:31,550
So if we just focus on the demand side, we weren't sort of happy with our results.

457
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:35,900
We're only getting sort of modestly effective results where we just focus on supply side.

458
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:41,720
We have to coordinate and get sort of reinforcing incentives on both sides of the market.

459
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:53,130
Right. That's kind of solving the information problem.

460
00:48:54,570 --> 00:49:07,590
And what about solving the competition problem? So why do we care?

461
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:17,280
Yeah, I do think that patient satisfaction surveys and patient ratings push providers to provide less valuable care.

462
00:49:17,890 --> 00:49:25,200
You know, because if someone wants this medication or wants you to investigate something that's not high value and that would affect I mean,

463
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:28,660
if a physician wants to get good patient ratings and they care.

464
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:33,360
One of the sets of metrics is often patient satisfaction.

465
00:49:34,110 --> 00:49:40,140
So federal level is sort of capped surveys that go out to patients, which is a lot of good.

466
00:49:40,290 --> 00:49:46,979
And in my, you know, I think providers definitely say, well, you know, if I, you know,

467
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:53,190
argue with you about not needing this test, are you going to fill out a bad satisfaction survey on me?

468
00:49:53,910 --> 00:49:57,719
Because the knowledge is not patient. It's not like a free market.

469
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:02,550
They know everything that's good is sort of it.

470
00:50:03,210 --> 00:50:07,440
It can become a circle of mistrust. Nobody trusts the insurers.

471
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:14,819
The patients don't trust the doctors. The doctors don't trust the patients. It's not that they don't trust each other.

472
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:17,820
It's that competing with each other in the system set up that way.

473
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:23,070
Yeah. So why do we even want competition?

474
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:29,700
There's a great quote from already there. The virtue of competition is that organizations are constantly pushed to do better.

475
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:33,360
If they don't, another firm can and will take their place.

476
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:38,069
So that's sort of that competitive ideal. That's why, you know, we think there's something good about competition.

477
00:50:38,070 --> 00:50:41,640
That's how we got to that nice equilibrium in our perfectly competitive market.

478
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:50,130
I'm doing a lousy job. I'm not going to be in this business very long if it's a well-functioning market.

479
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:57,420
So consolidation is likely to increase prices. It's not just going to be.

480
00:50:57,420 --> 00:51:00,660
So we think about prices in the U.S. for private payers.

481
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:04,409
Those are the ones that can rise. It's consolidation with Medicare and Medicaid.

482
00:51:04,410 --> 00:51:10,320
These are fee schedules. But it turns out that public budgets are still affected by private prices going up.

483
00:51:12,630 --> 00:51:18,000
If you everybody who gets their commercial insurance through their employer gets it with pretax dollars.

484
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:24,220
So if the cost of care goes up. Essentially the federal tax subsidy to private insurance goes up.

485
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:33,700
Similarly, if you buy insurance on exchanges and you're under 400% of the federal poverty line, you get some subsidies by, the care goes up.

486
00:51:33,970 --> 00:51:41,710
The formula are going to increase those subsidies. So it's not just the commercial payers that are paying the higher prices.

487
00:51:42,130 --> 00:51:48,610
It reflects on the public budgets as well. Also equality issues.

488
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:52,600
If I don't have to compete on price, I probably am off to compete on quality either.

489
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:57,790
One interesting study found that Medicare beneficiaries suffering a heart

490
00:51:57,790 --> 00:52:04,750
attack were 1.5% more likely to die if they ran markets with fewer competitors.

491
00:52:06,130 --> 00:52:10,300
Hospitals don't have to compete on price. They also don't have to compete as aggressively on quality as.

492
00:52:12,670 --> 00:52:17,500
So you know, the price competition is on private payers. The quality outcomes spilled over to Medicare.

493
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:26,640
So how can we promote and preserve the level of competition and market the number of different things we say?

494
00:52:26,650 --> 00:52:31,780
Well, there's a certain amount of competition that we have. Let's try to maintain that and at least not lose it further.

495
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:39,280
We can try to encourage entry by new participants, and we can try to prevent anti-competitive practices,

496
00:52:40,090 --> 00:52:44,020
particularly by the dominant providers in the market.

497
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:48,460
So how can we maintain competitiveness of markets?

498
00:52:49,690 --> 00:52:55,480
And one policy that's getting a lot of talk and I think anybody do this for a site neutral payments.

499
00:52:57,550 --> 00:53:01,780
So Medicare pays extra facility fees to hospital based providers.

500
00:53:03,890 --> 00:53:07,940
There are actually three classes this fight on who have told what story to.

501
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:17,990
My wife is an oncologist. She was in private practice in an office physically attached to the hospital building rented from the hospital.

502
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:28,030
Ten years ago, the hospital bought the practice. She's in the same physical office, giving chemotherapy to the patients in the same chair.

503
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:32,750
The hospital gets to collect a higher fee for that service.

504
00:53:33,830 --> 00:53:41,390
She's doing nothing different for anybody. Same office, same share, same infusion.

505
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:47,220
Hospital gets to charge more money for the drugs. They get 340 subsidies as well.

506
00:53:47,230 --> 00:53:50,440
You've heard about those and they get a higher facility fee.

507
00:53:51,010 --> 00:53:55,360
So it's a tremendous incentive for hospitals and physicians to integrate because

508
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:59,920
they're going to make more money together because the payments are not side neutral.

509
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:09,470
She kind of artificially props up the profitability of a joint venture compared to keeping hospitals and physicians empathetic.

510
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:17,059
How is like a payer Medicare supposed to know if that site is like where they were doing it before

511
00:54:17,060 --> 00:54:23,330
and now they're just getting a higher rate that they really don't need under the regulation.

512
00:54:23,630 --> 00:54:29,020
When she was when she was independent and renting from the hospital, it was a private office.

513
00:54:30,570 --> 00:54:36,980
But as soon as she's employed by the hospital, she is now operating at a hospital facility.

514
00:54:36,990 --> 00:54:42,150
It just changes the classification of the facility from independent to hospital owned.

515
00:54:42,470 --> 00:54:47,430
Right. So if they're trying to enforce something like this, how would they even logistically go about doing something?

516
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:55,460
Well, the way to enforce it would be to say, you know, we're paying the same regardless of site so we don't care about facilities.

517
00:54:56,010 --> 00:55:02,310
Right. So if so, if there's a facility fee of $100 paid to a hospital, it's also be $100 if it's in a private office.

518
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:09,240
So they would enforcement in that case actually simple because they say, well, if we're no longer paying more for one site than another.

519
00:55:10,590 --> 00:55:18,120
So then when hospitals lose a lot of money on that, if it's being done at the actual hospital because really compared to a physician office.

520
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:25,870
They lose money relative to current payment, that sort of pays them more, but that payment doesn't.

521
00:55:26,650 --> 00:55:33,940
The cost didn't change by ownership change, but their cost does because they still have four legitimate facilities.

522
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:42,429
Right. So you have a surgery center or an operating center. They pay those facilities to over to subsidize the cost of having that huge

523
00:55:42,430 --> 00:55:45,520
capital outlay up front where you may not have that in a physician's office.

524
00:55:45,730 --> 00:55:50,930
So you can't just say no facility fees because then there's no incentive to have an hour.

525
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:51,730
Right.

526
00:55:51,730 --> 00:56:00,730
So it also it was kind of a horrible time when there were many fewer things done outpatient and the things on outpatient were much simpler things.

527
00:56:01,180 --> 00:56:06,160
And now, as technology has involved lots of stuff, has moved to the outpatient setting.

528
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:11,059
And, you know, it's no longer tied to being in a hospital.

529
00:56:11,060 --> 00:56:15,260
And essentially, this is also when a hospital is providing outpatient care.

530
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:23,570
Why should they get a higher price than when the exact same care is being provided outside a hospital?

531
00:56:24,890 --> 00:56:29,040
This isn't an inpatient care. This is outpatient care. It's like an adjustment for cost of living, though.

532
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:32,060
It's like the same theory there. Right.

533
00:56:32,090 --> 00:56:38,120
But when we want to drive care to the most efficient setting if delivering the same care is more expensive in a hospital?

534
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:42,230
Is it good policy to say, Oh, your costs are higher, here is your money?

535
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:46,940
As opposed to saying, Well, maybe we should do it over here in the outpatient setting where the costs are higher.

536
00:56:49,790 --> 00:56:55,259
Drive our driver towards cheapest as opposed to saying, Oh, poor hospital, your costs are so high,

537
00:56:55,260 --> 00:57:03,430
we need to pay you bundles of money and seems like a very inefficient policy assuming quality of care is the same.

538
00:57:03,470 --> 00:57:07,920
All right. So in that example, I mean, literally it was the same.

539
00:57:11,030 --> 00:57:17,629
Administrative simplification. So if I were a small organization trying to compete with large organizations and everything

540
00:57:17,630 --> 00:57:22,190
is getting so complicated and value based payment is adding to that complication,

541
00:57:22,190 --> 00:57:31,070
I've got all kinds of data collection, data reporting, transmitting quality metrics so it's more efficient for big organizations to do that.

542
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:36,830
So our push towards these value based payment systems could itself be pushing towards consolidation.

543
00:57:38,790 --> 00:57:42,139
A big part of that push towards value based payment.

544
00:57:42,140 --> 00:57:52,280
If you take it down, the further steps of that chart that we saw is risk bearing that easier for a small organization

545
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:57,260
to bear risk or a large organization are going to be large for sure because of large numbers.

546
00:57:57,530 --> 00:58:03,500
And go to your stats class. If I've got, you know, ten patients and one of them needs a liver transplant this year, I'm screwed.

547
00:58:04,580 --> 00:58:09,140
I've got 2 million patients. I can predict pretty accurately how many are getting liver transplants this year.

548
00:58:11,370 --> 00:58:18,870
So you also need to facilitate smaller organizations ability to bear risk if we're going to try to impose much more risk on providers.

549
00:58:20,690 --> 00:58:26,030
Without getting all the small organizations say, Well, I'm out, time to sell.

550
00:58:30,220 --> 00:58:35,740
Promote entry. So part of the pressure is not just pressure from your existing competitors.

551
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:43,690
It's when you know that if I don't behave well in this market, I might invite entry by new competitors.

552
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:50,260
So if you don't have to worry about that threat of entry, we don't have to worry nearly as much about our behavior in the market.

553
00:58:51,250 --> 00:58:55,990
And it turns out that a lot of policies we have actually create barriers to entry.

554
00:58:56,590 --> 00:59:02,740
And they often things that are done for other reasons and certificate of need.

555
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:12,280
So 35 states have certificate of need requiring that you go to the states permission to open a new facility or build a new hospital in Michigan.

556
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:17,860
I don't have to just get a location. Investors. I have to get a certificate of need designation.

557
00:59:21,570 --> 00:59:26,280
So the nominal policy objective is to try to prevent excessive utilization.

558
00:59:27,300 --> 00:59:32,760
So as well, if we have more hospitals, we're going to get more hospital use and some of that use is going to be excessive.

559
00:59:32,770 --> 00:59:39,930
So you need to convince the regulators that you're the community you're putting the hospital in, really needs those extra beds.

560
00:59:40,950 --> 00:59:46,740
Hasn't been shown to be terribly effective. We're also very willing provider laws in a lot of states.

561
00:59:48,340 --> 00:59:54,220
So insurers best leverage in negotiating discounts is the threat to exclude you from the network.

562
00:59:56,200 --> 01:00:00,040
That's the most powerful leverage insurance to get a good price from providers.

563
01:00:00,370 --> 01:00:05,919
If you don't cut me a deal, you lose access to my enrollees because you're not going to be in my network or you're going to

564
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:10,900
be in a less preferred tier in my network where those people have to pay a lot more to see you.

565
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:19,400
That depends on who has more leverage, whether the hospital system is in an island and there's no other hospital systems or the pair has all.

566
01:00:19,990 --> 01:00:24,280
There's no other hospital system. There's no leverage. But the insurer is going to have leverage.

567
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:30,250
The most powerful source of that leverage is the threat to leave you out of the network or to put you in a less preferred tier.

568
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:35,530
So if I have some leverage, that's what gives me the leverage on any willing providers.

569
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:43,450
Law says that any provider that's willing to accept my standard terms must be allowed into my network.

570
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:49,750
So basically it says, okay, you're the insurer's main source of leverage is illegal.

571
01:00:52,750 --> 01:00:55,620
You know, if I have it, these are fees I pay for orthopedists.

572
01:00:55,950 --> 01:01:01,860
You're an orthopedist with a license in the state, and you say, I'll accept that fee schedule that you pay all your other orthopedists.

573
01:01:02,550 --> 01:01:10,520
I have to have you in my provider network. A scope of practice laws.

574
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:17,910
What's the nominal purpose? What's the public policy purpose of the scope of practice?

575
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:25,680
Why might we want to have them professionals that are trained to do the things that they're providing services to do?

576
01:01:26,090 --> 01:01:32,850
Right. So as a consumer protection of patient protection, you know, we probably don't want a nurse doing neurosurgery.

577
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:42,990
So we have limits on license says if you have this license and this level of training, this is what you're allowed to do.

578
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:47,910
Now, in practice, there's a lot of variation between states.

579
01:01:48,390 --> 01:01:54,600
So is it really true that a nurse practitioner is capable of doing this service if they happen to be in Illinois,

580
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:58,100
but they're not capable if they're in Indiana with the same training.

581
01:02:03,330 --> 01:02:09,220
Limits to. But services they can do, probably driven by, say, the physician saying, oh,

582
01:02:09,260 --> 01:02:12,860
we don't really want nurse practitioners doing that because we want to keep doing that.

583
01:02:16,450 --> 01:02:22,200
So there's a good public policy purpose of that. While there has to be some limit based on training to protect the public.

584
01:02:23,260 --> 01:02:30,070
But that limit is often pushed too far not to protect the public, but to protect the ones that have a higher license.

585
01:02:31,970 --> 01:02:36,170
Licensure itself. Why protect people from unqualified providers?

586
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:41,860
Anybody want me doing brain surgery on them? Health economist during neurosurgery who is?

587
01:02:42,990 --> 01:02:46,100
Well, no neurosurgery for me.

588
01:02:46,580 --> 01:02:53,300
But neurosurgeons make more money than health economists. So if I could just observe that and say I'm going to be a neurosurgeon.

589
01:02:56,220 --> 01:03:00,959
Really sublicense your laws to protect you from me. But on the other hand,

590
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:06,420
the organizations that benefit from these licensure laws influence the criteria

591
01:03:06,420 --> 01:03:10,110
to get the license and how many training slots there are in the first place,

592
01:03:10,110 --> 01:03:14,910
even if there could be many more qualified providers. So it becomes a big barrier to entry.

593
01:03:19,150 --> 01:03:22,690
So we also want to potentially prevent anti-competitive practices.

594
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:33,880
So that's largely antitrust policy. So antitrust is sort of enforced in four different ways by four different types of organizations or individuals.

595
01:03:34,870 --> 01:03:39,790
The big one is the Federal Trade Commission. So they have a health care division.

596
01:03:40,420 --> 01:03:43,630
There's also a Department of Justice. They can be involved in health care.

597
01:03:44,170 --> 01:03:50,170
Their unique ability is to bring criminal charges. FTC can only bring civil actions, not criminal actions.

598
01:03:52,730 --> 01:03:55,940
Criminal actions are incredibly rare in health care for the DOJ.

599
01:03:55,940 --> 01:04:01,400
So they have that power tends not to be. So the FTC is really kind of the bigger player.

600
01:04:02,300 --> 01:04:06,260
There are also states attorneys generals. So every state has an attorney general.

601
01:04:06,830 --> 01:04:10,070
They out there are state antitrust laws, just like there are federal laws.

602
01:04:10,730 --> 01:04:18,110
Oftentimes, they work together with the FTC and oftentimes also injured parties can bring suits and we'll see an example of that.

603
01:04:19,340 --> 01:04:24,670
So those are four actors that can sort of enforce antitrust.

604
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:30,980
And what's the objective? It's improving consumer well-being by protecting competition.

605
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:37,810
Now, that's not the same as protecting a competitor. Competitors can be hurt by competition.

606
01:04:38,260 --> 01:04:41,920
It's the consumer. That's the litmus test. We want to protect the consumer's interest.

607
01:04:43,890 --> 01:04:53,080
Robust, competitive economy. There are going to be losers. So it's not about protecting competitors, it's about protecting competition.

608
01:04:53,470 --> 01:04:57,130
So it's kind of a subtly different thing. The important difference.

609
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:09,900
Goes way back Sherman Act in 1890 that's when you had a bunch of particularly in these sort of commodity things oil iron railroads.

610
01:05:12,210 --> 01:05:16,080
That the a few big companies that controlled it and they kind of.

611
01:05:16,260 --> 01:05:21,840
Not only do they control big share of the market, they got together kind of like we talked about pack and colluded.

612
01:05:23,050 --> 01:05:26,950
And said, you know what? We've got the three big steel companies in the country.

613
01:05:28,210 --> 01:05:32,050
Why are we competing with each other on price? Why don't we just.

614
01:05:34,330 --> 01:05:38,170
Ordinate and agree we're all going to raise our prices simultaneously.

615
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:45,280
And so that's the Sherman Act and that has been amended by a couple of subsequent acts.

616
01:05:46,980 --> 01:05:55,450
What do they prohibit? Every contract combination or conspiracy and restraint of trade and even novelization,

617
01:05:55,450 --> 01:06:01,540
attempted monopolization or conspiracy or combination to monopolize, including behaviors like price fixing.

618
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:10,180
And then there's been a number of Supreme Court cases that have sort of clarified that, well, it's not really any it has to be sort of unreasonable.

619
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:14,740
There might be some behaviors that might be deemed you know,

620
01:06:14,770 --> 01:06:19,030
they might look like they violate that, but they might be reasonable, competitive behaviors.

621
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:23,440
So that's the eye of the beholder. The iron courts.

622
01:06:25,310 --> 01:06:35,250
Okay. How does the FTC deal with a merger? The first is that there's a threshold value that's around $90 million of assets for the combined entity.

623
01:06:36,450 --> 01:06:39,560
If I'm acquiring $90 million of assets, we're going to merge.

624
01:06:40,380 --> 01:06:49,110
I have to report to the FTC. The FTC then has 30 days to respond and they can't ask for more time.

625
01:06:49,110 --> 01:06:58,680
But they have to basically say either, you know, we want to block this merger or go ahead and say, okay, or we need more information.

626
01:07:01,580 --> 01:07:08,210
Now the FTC has to make a judgment about, well, what market are we talking about?

627
01:07:08,990 --> 01:07:12,680
What's the geographic extent of the market and what's the product market?

628
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:20,380
So we're talking about all these services provided in inpatient hospitals in Washtenaw County.

629
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:25,840
Or are there also competitors, say, like outpatient surgical units?

630
01:07:26,410 --> 01:07:33,310
Now, is the geographic market greater than Washtenaw County? So they have to decide sort of what's the geography of the market and.

631
01:07:35,010 --> 01:07:42,270
What's the product in the market in order to say who are producers and then how competitive is that market now and

632
01:07:42,270 --> 01:07:51,450
how competitive would it be after the merger is emerging as substantially decreases the level of competition?

633
01:07:51,750 --> 01:07:59,370
And is it going to make the level of competition too low? So in terms now, they've got very limited resources.

634
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:06,209
The FTC is not just dealing with health care through the whole economy. First of all, there are a lot of deals under $90 million.

635
01:08:06,210 --> 01:08:09,720
So whole lot can be that might be very important in local markets.

636
01:08:10,290 --> 01:08:15,040
So even their jurisdiction of where what even has to be reported, you know,

637
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:21,029
if you've got three plumbers in a small town and they decide, you know, hey, why are we competing with each other on price?

638
01:08:21,030 --> 01:08:24,750
Let's just merge our company and we'll have one plumbing company in this town.

639
01:08:26,780 --> 01:08:35,150
That's not going to get FTC scrutiny. Now, if you want if you want a plumber in that little town, you can bet you're affected by that.

640
01:08:38,130 --> 01:08:42,690
And so limited resources. Many mergers are just going to be allowed to proceed.

641
01:08:43,350 --> 01:08:48,030
So either they're going to say it's fine or the review period will expire and they'll have said nothing,

642
01:08:48,030 --> 01:08:58,229
which is the same implicitly as saying it's fine. Some others are going to just going to ask how realistic is it then for the FTC to go after vertical

643
01:08:58,230 --> 01:09:03,060
integration of hospitals and physician offices since they're almost always below $90 million?

644
01:09:04,050 --> 01:09:12,960
That's a real limitation. So it tends to be an acquisition of a big multi-specialty group practice that would be reportable.

645
01:09:13,530 --> 01:09:22,050
So but if you're talking about buying a solo practice or buying a group of five physicians, that's going to be way under the shield.

646
01:09:23,710 --> 01:09:26,460
A 1% thing was actually about this,

647
01:09:26,460 --> 01:09:35,940
and they talked about like amending that to lower the threshold to like prevent vertical integration and saying there are important types

648
01:09:35,940 --> 01:09:42,749
of vertical integration that just fly under the radar because the threshold is so high that the only thing you would have to be a large,

649
01:09:42,750 --> 01:09:49,440
multi-specialty group to the $90 million, that's a very small fraction of transactions.

650
01:09:52,470 --> 01:09:57,660
And others say, okay, we'll allow it, but we're going to have some modifications here and say,

651
01:09:58,110 --> 01:10:02,579
you know, we think that in this little piece of your market, there would be too little competition.

652
01:10:02,580 --> 01:10:08,729
So you've got to divest this one hospital so that one hospital can't be part of the deal.

653
01:10:08,730 --> 01:10:12,450
You've got to sell that off and you can you can agree to do that.

654
01:10:12,450 --> 01:10:18,330
And at that point, we'll say, okay, you're fine to merge, or you can fight the FTC and say,

655
01:10:18,630 --> 01:10:22,740
No, we're going to fight this in court because we want to keep that hospital.

656
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:27,720
Usually you will just say, okay, we'll divest that assets and move on.

657
01:10:27,930 --> 01:10:32,610
Most of the time, if the FTC puts conditions like that on it, they say, okay,

658
01:10:32,610 --> 01:10:39,420
well, it's easier than fighting through 90% of the merger and we'll sell that 10%.

659
01:10:41,190 --> 01:10:43,799
Or in the extreme, they can say, we want to block this merger.

660
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:51,330
We're going to prohibit you from merging, in which case then you have to either decide the deal's off or we'll fight it.

661
01:10:53,150 --> 01:10:57,110
And the FTC is trying to sort of create precedent because they've got limited resources.

662
01:10:57,110 --> 01:10:59,270
They can only bring a handful of cases a year.

663
01:10:59,930 --> 01:11:05,719
They want to get the most solid, clear cases that they can win, that then they can hold up as precedent.

664
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:10,220
So then when they're negotiating a future case and saying, you know, we're not going to allow this,

665
01:11:11,180 --> 01:11:17,600
they're going to back down rather than fight because they're going to say based on case law, this last three mergers that look like ours.

666
01:11:19,060 --> 01:11:27,820
Lost or if the FTC says we'll only allow it if you divest these assets, they'll be more likely to divest the assets rather than fight it.

667
01:11:28,540 --> 01:11:34,600
So you're trying to create a merger to give the FTC more power to influence future cases.

668
01:11:36,390 --> 01:11:42,760
The precedent. Now, what's less common, but they're allowed to do is a retrospective review.

669
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:50,290
And what's hard about these prospective challenges to mergers is this about hypotheticals.

670
01:11:51,230 --> 01:11:53,030
The FTC, let's say it goes to court.

671
01:11:53,450 --> 01:12:04,280
What the FTC has to show to prevail is that if this merger were allowed, these parties would behave badly in the future.

672
01:12:05,690 --> 01:12:11,870
It's kind of like a science fiction thing. You're going to murder somebody in ten years, so I'm going to arrest you today.

673
01:12:12,860 --> 01:12:17,710
That's a sci fi movie. That's essentially their burden of proof.

674
01:12:17,720 --> 01:12:22,870
It's to convince the court. Of something that hasn't happened yet.

675
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:28,530
That this would be bad for consumers if it were allowed to happen.

676
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:33,870
So the alternative is to say, okay, you can merge, but we're going to be watching.

677
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:40,860
And if you actually do behave badly after the merger, then we're going to come and try to break you up.

678
01:12:42,180 --> 01:12:46,799
So that kind of changes the burden of proof a bit because now you can say, here's the actual conduct.

679
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:57,630
Here is evidence, not conjecture. To block a merger, if it goes to court, FTC has to win on the basis of conjecture, not on the basis of evidence.

680
01:12:59,700 --> 01:13:06,060
And that 1% article that suggested modifying the antitrust laws to shift the burden of proof.

681
01:13:06,510 --> 01:13:15,750
Is that really realistic, though? Like, how likely is it to have that type of change in legislation around antitrust?

682
01:13:16,140 --> 01:13:19,500
I'd say that's pretty unlikely. That's what I that's what I wrote.

683
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:22,620
But I was like, that's just my own personal opinion.

684
01:13:22,620 --> 01:13:24,080
But I wasn't sure.

685
01:13:24,280 --> 01:13:33,450
And certainly the Biden administration has been much more interested in vigorous antitrust than enforcement, than the Trump administration.

686
01:13:33,450 --> 01:13:43,030
But that's within the realm of existing regulatory discretion, which is very different than passing legislation to change what that look.

687
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:48,899
Regulatory discretion is that that's a much harder that's pushing a boulder

688
01:13:48,900 --> 01:13:53,219
up a hill and changing your regulatory your existing regulatory discretion.

689
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:56,370
That's pushing a boulder down a hill. The administration can do that.

690
01:13:57,330 --> 01:14:00,750
They can increase the regulatory discretion in the first place.

691
01:14:02,780 --> 01:14:10,620
I think what's really hard about these and the reason they're so seldom done is it's incredibly costly to the organizations.

692
01:14:10,950 --> 01:14:14,340
Imagine two health care systems merging. You let them merge.

693
01:14:14,370 --> 01:14:18,480
Now it's five years later and you say, Oh, wait, you've raised prices.

694
01:14:19,140 --> 01:14:22,620
We're going to break you up. So now they merge their information systems.

695
01:14:22,620 --> 01:14:27,300
They merger clinical operations, their merger clinical departments that merge their supply chain.

696
01:14:28,530 --> 01:14:35,310
And now you're now you're telling us we've got to be ripped apart into two separate systems like divorce.

697
01:14:36,470 --> 01:14:37,020
Worst problem.

698
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:50,660
So it's something that is not done lightly because it's incredibly, incredibly burdensome to the organization to rip apart a completed merger.

699
01:14:52,190 --> 01:14:56,780
So recent cases, they blocked several mergers between large national insurers.

700
01:14:56,960 --> 01:15:00,440
So on the payor side, blocked hospital acquisitions.

701
01:15:00,440 --> 01:15:05,760
One physician group that was big enough that they blocked the acquisition, but that was a big multi-specialty group.

702
01:15:05,780 --> 01:15:08,900
I was in 2012. St Luke's. I think so. Promedica.

703
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:16,730
Yeah, I remember that challenged a number of mergers for the ones they challenged the first to eventually they abandoned.

704
01:15:17,210 --> 01:15:20,300
In other words, they said, We're not going to fight. This deal's off.

705
01:15:20,930 --> 01:15:27,470
That's kind of in some sense the best scenario for the FTC because they can save their limited court resources for other cases.

706
01:15:29,060 --> 01:15:36,230
The third one they eventually allowed and then this is the one that's been going on for about a decade where

707
01:15:36,230 --> 01:15:42,530
they're trying to rip apart a merger had previously been allowed since one case that does that retrospective.

708
01:15:42,980 --> 01:15:47,390
So most of them are prospective actions. There is one retrospective going on.

709
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:51,800
What's the reasoning for trying to rip them apart now?

710
01:15:53,030 --> 01:16:00,260
Instead, Northwestern largely evidence on how they've behaved in the commercial commercially insured market,

711
01:16:00,740 --> 01:16:04,230
both the pricing and various restrictions they've put on.

712
01:16:04,570 --> 01:16:09,470
You know, it's like you have to have all of us you can't you can't contract with one hospital in a system.

713
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:12,950
If we're going to be in your system, you have to have all of us. So that made leverage.

714
01:16:13,540 --> 01:16:18,500
You know, I you know, you have to have this hospital because you're going to lose a lot of enrollees if you don't have it.

715
01:16:18,860 --> 01:16:27,880
But then you've got to take all of us to the same terms. That's actually this case in Sutter Health started.

716
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:31,910
This is when we talked about private actions, a lawsuit by an injured party.

717
01:16:31,910 --> 01:16:38,810
In this case, it was the grocers union that started the suit. They sued Sutter for anti-competitive practices.

718
01:16:39,590 --> 01:16:45,050
Then the state attorney general took it up, who is now the HHS secretary?

719
01:16:48,020 --> 01:16:52,190
Incredibly complicated. About 160 parties were subpoenaed.

720
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:56,840
That delivered 16.9 million pages of documents.

721
01:16:57,650 --> 01:17:02,930
We want that job meaning us. Talk about finding the needle in the haystack.

722
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:07,280
How many of those documents are actually going to be useful? But you've got to find the ones that are useful.

723
01:17:08,450 --> 01:17:13,820
Ended up being settled. $575 million payment from Sutter.

724
01:17:14,180 --> 01:17:17,260
And probably more importantly, an agreement to end certain practices.

725
01:17:17,270 --> 01:17:20,660
The most important of those practices being that all or nothing contracting.

726
01:17:21,260 --> 01:17:26,600
So Sutter went to the insurers and basically said, You want any Sutter hospital in your network?

727
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:29,870
You take all Sutter hospitals in your network, get the same terms.

728
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:36,640
And they knew that they had certain hospitals for certain insurers were really important if they were going to be in the network there.

729
01:17:36,980 --> 01:17:40,010
That insurer become much, much less attractive to enrollees.

730
01:17:40,550 --> 01:17:48,890
And they leverage that to essentially say, okay, you want this hospital, take this one, this one, this one, this one and this one to take all of us.

731
01:17:49,610 --> 01:17:52,010
We're not writing any contracts with individual hospitals.

732
01:17:54,180 --> 01:18:00,930
Now, if you looked at the names of the parties involved in these various cases or tried to block it,

733
01:18:00,930 --> 01:18:05,070
etc., and if you kind of dig into those names, you'll see a lot of them are nonprofits.

734
01:18:06,690 --> 01:18:11,700
So antitrust law does not really draw any distinction between for profit nonprofit firms.

735
01:18:13,320 --> 01:18:17,790
It just looks at the level of competition and prices are the main concern.

736
01:18:17,790 --> 01:18:25,440
And it seems like nonprofit hospitals, when they merge, are pretty much as aggressive as for profit hospitals and raising subsequent prices.

737
01:18:26,430 --> 01:18:30,059
There's not sort of a huge difference. Also not a huge difference.

738
01:18:30,060 --> 01:18:34,500
If nonprofits merge, they don't suddenly say, well, now that we've raised all our commercial prices,

739
01:18:34,830 --> 01:18:43,180
we're going to do so much more charity care for our community. They don't seem to raise charity care any more than for profits.

740
01:18:43,330 --> 01:18:47,110
So it doesn't seem like there's that big of a difference in behavior.

741
01:18:47,500 --> 01:18:53,800
So that that lack of distinction between for profit nonprofits seems to be consistent with, you know.

742
01:18:55,680 --> 01:19:02,129
So it's kind of a wrap up perfect. 2 minutes. We don't have competition.

743
01:19:02,130 --> 01:19:04,440
It can impair performance not just in price,

744
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:13,440
but also potentially in quality in amenities and services for all your customer service, technical quality of care and prices.

745
01:19:14,310 --> 01:19:20,549
We've got a number of policies that actually promote consolidation or create barriers to entry,

746
01:19:20,550 --> 01:19:24,960
sort of as a side effect through policies or for other reasons, value based purchasing policies.

747
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:31,830
Well, they make collecting data and reporting it more burdensome on a little tiny organization that's hard,

748
01:19:31,980 --> 01:19:40,980
harder to comply with than if I were a big organization. We're pushing providers to take on more financial risk from big organization.

749
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:45,930
I can probably do that because I can predict my risk a lot better.

750
01:19:45,950 --> 01:19:51,470
The small organization where a few bad events of a year can have a significant impact.

751
01:19:53,090 --> 01:19:57,848
So we've got policies that are there for sort of one good purpose, but as a side effect, they.
