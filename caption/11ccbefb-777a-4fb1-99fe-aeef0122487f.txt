1
00:01:54,520 --> 00:02:02,760
It's. She?

2
00:02:39,330 --> 00:03:59,890
You. Crash.

3
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:53,930
Is that right?

4
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,700
You should get started. Hopefully more people will want.

5
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:09,480
So I'm plugging my way through the development experience for Simon.

6
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:19,130
Your feedback as of yet, except to sort of the broad idea, which I've already talked about, this is all about getting down into the details,

7
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:25,320
like really thinking through what is it that somebody is going to see, what are they going to experience, etc.

8
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,149
Some of you are having no problems with that. Really just engaging.

9
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:34,760
Got a lot of good examples are you're getting a little pulled off into like that's how as opposed to the what?

10
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:45,200
Yes, it is the case that how something is delivered will shape how we feel about it both cognitively and emotionally.

11
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:48,770
Like there's trust issues we want to we trust this information consciously.

12
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:56,390
We can present things in emotionally powerful ways or dampen that down, etc. That's not really what I'm wrestling with here.

13
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:08,209
So as we keep engaging with this and as we moved in this course towards thinking about number communication starting today with numeracy,

14
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:15,230
but more broadly about what are the types of data that we've indicated and the types of information that we give people that

15
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:24,320
hopefully are going to evoke both the cognitive assessment of risk and analytical thought about risk and to some degree,

16
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:33,490
an emotional response to that risk. Really engage with the question sort of first and foremost, what is the information?

17
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:36,040
And don't get fooled off into the way in which it's presented.

18
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,950
That stuff is an important but I'm going to really wrestle with in this class with how do we think about

19
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:49,930
shaping the way in which we're presenting the information that will push people for particular positions,

20
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:57,820
push them towards critical or emotional responses, etc., so that we know at least what our whole intending to be communicating.

21
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:08,960
And to get us started with this, I want to show you a classic psychological experiment about number perception.

22
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:15,400
Imagine for the moment, I'm not going to do this for real.

23
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:21,340
But imagine for the moment that I was going to make a offer to you.

24
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:27,220
Would you would draw jelly beans for one of two bowls.

25
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:32,920
And if you drew an orange jelly bean, you would win.

26
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:38,720
I'd say win 100 bucks. If you drew a blue jelly bean, you would.

27
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:45,530
And there's two balls up here, so it's a small ball.

28
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:50,450
Finally you would draw this blind. So I'm going to show you what's in the bowl.

29
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:57,620
But then you would be blinded and you would. So the random draw from the whole small bowl.

30
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:03,300
As one 409 fluence.

31
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:13,060
It's. A large pool. Has eight orange jellybeans.

32
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:19,590
And 92 fluent. I think I've got plenty to offer.

33
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:30,880
Which all do you want to draw from? So you are.

34
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:39,229
Act one. Why? Because it's a one in ten chance as opposed to an eight in 100 or whatever.

35
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:45,230
That's. So it's a 10% chance versus an 8% chance. So the analytical framing of this.

36
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:54,170
Says You pick the small ball because if you understand probability, you have the numeracy skills.

37
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:57,770
To understand probability, you understand that 10% is greater than 8%.

38
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:02,090
So you've got a better chance of winning. Very straightforward. Did you?

39
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:06,470
Did any of you feel like you wanted to pick from the bigger bowl?

40
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:14,059
One out because it looks more even I calculate calculated math,

41
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:19,820
but it still looks more to me that so you looks more in the it's not just that there's more jellybeans.

42
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:23,120
There's more jellybeans there that would enable you to win.

43
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:32,550
Ever hear a lottery ad that says more chances to win? This is what we're talking about.

44
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:41,170
When we represent chances concretely.

45
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:46,870
And I can see that there are eight different living jellybeans here.

46
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:50,979
That is an experiential process.

47
00:09:50,980 --> 00:10:00,370
Like I'm not consciously going, Wow, there's one there, one there I am just through my sense of my visual sense, getting a sense of more.

48
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:06,779
And that provides a a motivation.

49
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:12,600
Like I'm basically screening out the blue ones and I'm, I'm visually noting all the different ones that might make me win.

50
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:19,310
Now a highly numerate person goes down the pathway they entered.

51
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:22,880
It says, Look, this is just representations of probability.

52
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:27,620
Large phenomena or a small denominator does not matter. I'm only going to pick one.

53
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:35,549
These things are equivalent. And so. The analytical representation of probability.

54
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:40,920
We could count it as one in ten. We can put it as. Ten out of 100.

55
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:44,820
We could put it in percentage terms. It doesn't matter. They're all coming to the same place.

56
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:48,480
And so when you make that comparison, ten is bigger than 8%.

57
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:52,150
Great. That answers the question. But.

58
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:59,750
There is a part of us that is particularly salient for people with lower numeracy.

59
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:03,860
That is more about the representation. It's less about the underlying.

60
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:09,520
Idea of 8% or 10%. It's more. But how is that being represented?

61
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:20,260
Which is why one of the fundamental takeaway points from the numeracy literature is that the format you use to present numerical information is

62
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:31,300
likely to have a disproportionate effect on people with lower numeracy skills because they're relying more on the physical representation so that.

63
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:42,850
For example, saying out of 100 feels to them like a larger thing than one out of ten.

64
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:50,000
Why? Because there's ten things rather than one thing. And we have a numerical representation in our mind.

65
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:52,130
This is ten is bigger than one. Well, that's true.

66
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:58,340
But you have to go further than that to recognize you care only about the ratio and not about the absolute numbers.

67
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:05,710
Notice that this pilot this is one of the biggest takeaways from this class, the nominators matter.

68
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:13,809
You might think this is all about? Well, it's only about the ratio. Yes.

69
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:18,720
You know, especially when you're talking about people who are more numerous.

70
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,680
The format matters. Representation matter, the denominator matters.

71
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:32,590
So we're going to make choices about how we're representing information because it has an impact on how people are going to respond.

72
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:43,959
Well. This is a flawed study.

73
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:51,310
It's been repeated many, many times. And what I want you to take away from this is.

74
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,960
Even if you are like, Oh, well, obviously you picked the small one.

75
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:03,590
If you take away from your existence, a piece of us is still processing this stuff in that unconscious way.

76
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:17,700
There's going to be a lot of times in which. You look at the data that you're trying to communicate, and it's totally obvious to you what it means.

77
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:25,090
Every one of you is on the upper end of the innumeracy spectrum compared to the rest of the population.

78
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:36,550
Some of you may feel more normal. Some of you may feel less numerate, but recognize that you're comparing yourselves against a university community.

79
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:43,870
We are already self-selected people who have gone through God and gotten bachelor's degrees,

80
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:51,220
gotten into graduate school like all of you have fundamental numeracy skills to at least some degree.

81
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,090
Now, that doesn't mean that this isn't there isn't variation like some people are more numbers.

82
00:13:57,090 --> 00:14:00,990
People are drawn towards numbers and others are less so.

83
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:09,299
But one of the big problems that we face is that most of the health numbers that we are going to be communicating in our work,

84
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:13,470
in our daily lives, etc., are things that we already understand.

85
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:21,980
And so it is obvious to us what they mean, not necessarily obvious to our audience.

86
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:30,230
Keep coming back to that theme over and over again. How do we take the knowledge that is unconscious to us and make it something that we are

87
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:35,270
including in our communication so it becomes more understandable to our target audience?

88
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:42,379
All right. The other thing I want to do and I almost never use slides,

89
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:49,790
but I will do it for this one because I want to show you what it is that we need when we're talking

90
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:53,470
about measuring numeracy before we get into the examples that are lots of good examples in.

91
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:02,200
I have two examples. This is one example.

92
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:09,980
It's a little bit bigger. Look if you ask questions.

93
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:22,110
Look at what they are trying to measure. So imagine we roll a fair six sided die a thousand times out of a thousand rolls.

94
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:26,720
How many times do you think the die would come up as an even number? So what do you need to know?

95
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:32,060
You want bigger? Yep.

96
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:38,420
What do you need to know to answer this? You need to know what the heck a guy is.

97
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:45,350
Do you understand the concept of randomness in the sense that there are six possible things that will come out?

98
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:48,410
You don't understand what an even number is versus an odd number.

99
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:53,630
Understand that that means that there's a 5050 chance as to whether or not it's going to come up with the number.

100
00:15:54,830 --> 00:16:01,640
And you need to understand that basically what you're doing is you're multiplying that underlying likelihood times the number of rules.

101
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:13,740
So what is the answer here? I. But notice this multiple the number sensor steps that are required to get you to that point.

102
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:21,180
And if you don't understand what a die is, if you don't understand what even numbers are, and if you don't understand the idea of taking one,

103
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:26,490
you know, one in three out of six and translate it into a thousand, you're going to fail the.

104
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:33,440
Here. Chance of winning a $10 prize is 1%.

105
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:40,690
What's your best guess about how many people would win a $10 prize if 1000 people each buy a single ticket so they get the same thing?

106
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:48,740
You're just multiplying out the nominee. Third question.

107
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:55,130
Chance of winning the car is one in a thousand. What's the percent changing denominator from 1000 to 100?

108
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:00,040
That's all it's doing. It's not even that complicated because the denominator here is one.

109
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:04,600
It's all you have to be able to do is to recognize, Oh, wait, I can have percentages.

110
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:11,470
It's a fraction of a percent, so it's a 10th of a percent. You got to understand percentages and decimals well enough to be able to describe.

111
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:20,760
Chance of disease is 20 out of 100. This would be the same as having a 20% chance.

112
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:29,630
This is about college math. This is relatively lower level number of math.

113
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:34,740
But the ideas that are critical here. So this is a much more complicated one.

114
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:40,070
But it's basically a critical idea.

115
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:48,110
You have a sense of a test. Let's get some immigrants.

116
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:58,370
From previous studies of people. So this is our baseline rate and have tumors 90 do not mammogram correctly find to find tumors incorrectly says

117
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:05,150
one does not have a tumor of 90 without correctly finds 80 without tumors and incorrectly says ten has tumors.

118
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:09,170
The table below summarizes this What's the likelihood this person actually had the tumor?

119
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:20,260
This is the classic bad theory problem. But you got to understand a lot of least amount of math here.

120
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:27,510
And then there's a couple more. And these are interesting questions. And a ball cost about ten and total.

121
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:32,960
That costs a dollar more than the ball. How much does the ball cost? Answer this like $0.05.

122
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:38,100
Go ahead. How many of you thought ten notice?

123
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:47,970
What happened there was that there was a number that popped up that seemed to come from the problem because you had this ten year.

124
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:52,149
It's just that the math doesn't work out. That's not the right answer.

125
00:18:52,150 --> 00:19:01,150
And you had to have enough confidence in your number calculation skills to recognize that that ten cent which pops up in your mind is wrong.

126
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:09,850
These. This is it. These eight questions are a one of the multiple.

127
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:16,580
Numeracy measures that are commonly used in research. The variety of questions.

128
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:21,670
Some of these are a lot easier than others. They tend to predict a variety of things in life.

129
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:28,979
Yeah, it's kind of a problem with the first question, though, because if you roll the dice 1000 times,

130
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:36,220
it's far more likely it's not going to come up 500 times as an even number than it actually is going to come up 500 times even number.

131
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,450
So you have an understanding there of randomness.

132
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:43,110
Yeah, it's even more nuanced than what the question is asking for.

133
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:48,569
But what is the most likely thing that will come up? But likely is that it will be 500.

134
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:52,860
But if you take the sum of the probabilities of all the other chances that way, more likely.

135
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:58,299
And part of what this is measuring in some sense is do you understand what the question is?

136
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:01,300
Asking the questions and asking what is the most likely thing that we're gonna get?

137
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:11,050
It doesn't exactly say that point. I get the point here is not the is these are these questions representing specific mathematical knowledge.

138
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:17,200
It's how do you answer them as predictive of how you will respond to number information in general?

139
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:24,580
Yeah. Do you have like an idea of the distribution of scores that people tend to get?

140
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:27,639
And these are like this particular one? Yes.

141
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:38,410
Because it was developed by a much larger battery of questions and using a particular form of analysis known as rash analysis,

142
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:43,120
to identify questions that have stronger predictive ability, lesser predictability,

143
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,960
high likelihood of being answered correctly, low likelihood of being asked for,

144
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:53,440
likelihood of getting a spectrum of them get sort of maximal predictive ability across the whole range of abilities that we see in the population.

145
00:20:54,630 --> 00:21:01,090
Now, different measures have different properties, some of them, some of the more commonly ones used ones.

146
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:07,210
Most people get most of the questions right. Some of the one most people get most the question is wrong, etc.

147
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:13,489
So you might be asking sort of like, well, do we use these by sort of setting up thresholds?

148
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:16,850
Like can we define something as sufficient numeracy?

149
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:21,570
Adequate numeracy? To some degree.

150
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:28,320
Do that. I have a problem with it because this is these are arbitrary measures.

151
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:31,770
What we really care about is the ability to do the underlying task,

152
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:36,480
which is to spend the rest of today talking about why do we care about this thing called numeracy?

153
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:44,200
These are arbitrary measures of particular type of thinking.

154
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:49,520
Now I want to contrast this with a different type of measurement.

155
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:59,690
It also measures numeracy, but in a fundamentally different way. You big.

156
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:10,080
How good are you working with fractions? Great gut reaction.

157
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:11,380
Are you good or not good?

158
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:21,410
How good are you at calculating a 15% yield and no, no pulling out the iPhone like in your head as you're signing the bill kind of thing.

159
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:26,090
How good are you at knowing how much you're going to say? That's not fair.

160
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:35,110
Sure it is 25% off. These are everyday experiences that are also lucky, those same skills.

161
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:43,540
And we also know through our own subjective experience how easy or hard we find these tasks.

162
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:48,350
By the way, you can also measure. Preference.

163
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:54,370
So when you read a newspaper, this is created back when people had paper newspapers.

164
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,890
How helpful do you find tables and graphs? My one of my favorite ones is this one.

165
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:06,800
When you hear a weather forecast, you prefer the predictions using percentages or words.

166
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:16,540
I'm a numbers person. Like I'm the person who goes to the weather site and pulls up the probabilities of rain.

167
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:22,360
And I will react differently, whether it's a 40% number versus a 60% number versus a 20% number.

168
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:26,650
I know lots of people were like, No, just tell me what I need to bring the damn umbrella and I'm done.

169
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:36,810
But that's also a measure of the degree to which we are seeking information represented in quantitative form versus more qualitative for.

170
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:41,020
And you could. If that isn't obvious, think about this.

171
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:47,080
Do you want your doctor to tell you you have a 20% chance of having the side effect or a possibility of that side effect?

172
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:58,260
Same problem. So this is an alternate way, and there are both strengths and weaknesses of this approach to measurement.

173
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:06,640
Strength as people find it a lot easier, get more comfortable with it. I mean, when you get people to the first type, it's basically a math test.

174
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:13,340
People hate it. We get people dropping out of research, it really annoys them, etc.

175
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:15,990
People don't mind about this stuff. Okay. I don't.

176
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:25,250
The weakness of this is it's subjective, which means that it's based upon your compact, your sense of your comparison versus others.

177
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:34,489
So if I administer this here, those of you who might rate yourselves relatively poorly are doing so.

178
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:38,840
Because what's the relative comparison standard of popping to my college students?

179
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:46,470
Graduate students? Yet in this population there's variability, but compare it to the average person out in the world.

180
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:52,700
We are all relatively numerate. So this is this is what we're talking about.

181
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:59,600
It has strengths and weaknesses. But I wanted you to see the measurement processes before we get into what did we think this thing is

182
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:04,220
predicting why we might want to talk about this and measure it when we're trying to work with people.

183
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:12,520
All right. So.

184
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:26,330
Lots of really good number examples in your musings for today, but I wanted actually to start with a couple examples that are not.

185
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:33,390
Because this isn't just a health idea. So it's a how do we go through the world?

186
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:38,730
So, Emily, Beth's.

187
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:45,400
You were talking about sports betting? Yeah.

188
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:51,010
So in my meeting, I talked about the last football game in Michigan versus Hawaii.

189
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:55,540
And obviously, Hawaii isn't a great team. So we knew that Michigan win.

190
00:25:56,110 --> 00:26:02,409
But the people that I attended the game where they are placing bets on FanDuel and I don't know the right terminology,

191
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:08,590
but there is a certain spread where if Michigan won by a certain amount of points in the first half versus the entire game,

192
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:15,790
like you could win a lot of money. And so the people that I attended with were kind of talking whether or not they took that bet or not,

193
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:23,019
because as we were watching the game, they were like, oh, like, you know, like the I think it was like 32 points in the first half.

194
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:27,099
And Michigan did that too. Like, oh, like really get this funny or not.

195
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:38,739
And so there is a whole space of probability and quantity information in sports where you do fantasy sports, where you just follow baseball.

196
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:41,200
For those of you who are interested in baseball, think about batting averages.

197
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,840
The concept of a batting average is how many times does the batter come up to the plate?

198
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:48,580
How many times do they get a hit?

199
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:57,820
This is a probability you talk about know this person had a 252 batting average and then they had a good day and they got four hits.

200
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:02,320
There is a probability updating process that is happening right there.

201
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:08,550
That is absolute ID in the world of sports statistics.

202
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:15,360
So when we started thinking about how do you measure numeracy, what are the real world examples of numeracy?

203
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:22,410
One of the things that comes up is people who engage in things like sports betting or following sport,

204
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:27,340
fantasy sports, etc. have a particular set of numbers skills.

205
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:32,610
They're used to manipulating numbers, updating them, understanding ratios, etc.

206
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:36,700
The question becomes, does that translate from one domain to another?

207
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:43,080
If somebody knows probability in the sports space, does that translate when we give them health statistics?

208
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:49,640
The answer is maybe it's not immediately obvious because it is specialized knowledge to some degree.

209
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:54,200
But we're talking about the same basic ideas. Here's another domain.

210
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:59,360
That is one that you might not think of as numeracy, but it absolutely is.

211
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:07,670
Ever try to triple A recipe? Any problem.

212
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:17,430
You're working across units like, Oh wait, I've got to have two tablespoons, but I'm tripling the recipe so you know how.

213
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:21,800
What is that in cups like? Yeah, same problem.

214
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:25,190
Like you're shifting denominators, you're doing multiplication, you're taking the same.

215
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:32,930
People who are good chefs who are used to working in scaling recipes, have fundamental numeracy skills.

216
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:42,700
Question is, can they then translate those into other domains? So I don't want you to think this is only some sort of abstract academic knowledge.

217
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:47,620
Like our daily lives incorporate these kinds of skills in different ways.

218
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:53,410
The value of them is they enable us to do things.

219
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:58,000
And that's what I want to spend the rest of today talking about. Like, what does numeracy do for us?

220
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:01,540
Education? Where does it work? Where's the breakdown?

221
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:05,170
And what does that mean for us? And we're thinking about designing communications.

222
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:10,610
So second one before I get into the health stuff.

223
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,680
Emma. They you Richter scale.

224
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:23,009
Yeah. I wrote about how growing up in California we had to do earthquake drills and

225
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:26,070
we learned about the Richter scale for measuring the magnitude of earthquakes,

226
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:29,100
which is most people know it as like a 0 to 10 scale.

227
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:37,290
But it's kind of complicated to understand because every point on the scale that you go is a ten times larger logarithmic scale.

228
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:43,919
Yeah, so we had a 5.6 earthquake and it's kind of difficult to place that on a scale of like, oh,

229
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:49,560
we had like a 4.6 the month before the 5.6 actually ten times like quote unquote worse earthquake.

230
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:52,349
But none of the numbers really mean anything unless, you know,

231
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:57,569
like how much damage is obvious or like actually helpful information about what the numbers mean.

232
00:29:57,570 --> 00:30:02,450
And so I'd had some pictures also that kind of understand the scale.

233
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:05,669
I grew up in California. I have lived through 5.6 earthquakes.

234
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:08,160
I have an intuitive understanding of what that is.

235
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:15,270
I know because I've lived through them, you know, I know the physical experience of a five and a half earthquake.

236
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:18,720
I know that I've not even noticed for earthquakes.

237
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:28,260
I know that you go from five and a half to 6.7 and you're talking about dramatically different levels of damage.

238
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:35,820
That comes from my experience. I have seen these things, but we're talking about number communication.

239
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:42,559
You haven't had that experience. If you haven't had somebody try and connect the dots like this number equals this experience,

240
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:46,310
this number equals this experience, etc., that doesn't have much meaning.

241
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:51,440
And as you say, one of the big problems with the Richter scale is that we tend to think linearly.

242
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:58,170
But the scale isn't linear. It's logarithmic.

243
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:06,690
And so this ten times multiplier makes it very difficult for people to appreciate, you know, if this area went through a seven,

244
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:15,540
roughly seven point earthquake 30 years ago, if it ever has an eight point earthquake, there's going to be buildings flattened.

245
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:20,940
Even in that space, his eight point earthquake is catastrophic.

246
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:25,590
But that's very hard for the number to communicate because of their way of setup.

247
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:34,920
Yes. Is your idea of being alerted by anthropology class that are using the base system in some cultures is different base system?

248
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:39,810
Absolutely. And understanding what a numeracy looks culturally is really on my mind right now.

249
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:45,630
Why do we use base ten? This is.

250
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:51,210
Because we're used to counting. We used to count on the physical manifestations of our body.

251
00:31:51,360 --> 00:32:01,490
And that is why we use space to. There are lots of things that make sense to assess in logarithmic terms, by the way.

252
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:04,520
One of them. Is epidemics.

253
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:09,450
The growth of epidemics happens algorithmically, exponentially.

254
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:19,600
And yet we measure often counts. We report data of how many people are getting COVID 19 in absolute terms,

255
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:26,110
and that inhibits to some degree our ability to understand the underlying patterns,

256
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:32,410
because the representation doesn't match the real world phenomenon, which is exponential.

257
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:37,240
But again, this is a tangent I want to I just want to hit upon.

258
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:42,730
Let's touch upon a variety of the issues that you guys brought up in terms of how numeracy plays out.

259
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:44,680
In particular, what I want to talk about today is.

260
00:32:45,670 --> 00:33:02,590
When will numeracy make someone particularly more able or less able to do what they need to do to be healthy, whatever that means and to start.

261
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:11,340
Caroline. Yeah. You and Kayla.

262
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:18,710
You were talking about birth control from the patient's standpoint. You were talking about birth control from the physician standpoint.

263
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:23,000
Both of you were talking about there's a [INAUDIBLE] of a lot of numbers in birth control choices.

264
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:29,400
Yeah, I read hers because I control of birth control to see if anybody wrote about it besides me.

265
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:39,530
And so it was interesting from your perspective, the chart system is helpful, but for mine it wasn't.

266
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:45,890
So and it's funny because I'm also patient education writer, basically.

267
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:52,040
And so I started it like when I first got on birth control was like 17.

268
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:54,530
Planned Parenthood, like the whole stereotypical thing.

269
00:33:54,530 --> 00:34:04,370
And I looked at the chart just basically like I was like, Oh, they're all like similarly effective, except for a couple of ones.

270
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:11,130
I suppose the first or second, what was the number representations of effectiveness that you remember seeing?

271
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:17,330
Like how was that shown? I think those percentages what were those percentages mean, if you remember?

272
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:24,440
What were they meaning? Yeah. 4% effective at preventing pregnancy.

273
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:28,910
Okay. To pause for a moment. Over what time?

274
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:34,740
A year. Usually these statistics are done in a year.

275
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:42,750
I didn't know that. And the fact that that isn't obvious and many people just miss that isn't one of the core communication problems in this space.

276
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:48,540
We're not just talking about chance of pregnancy in one sexual encounter.

277
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:51,780
We're talking about chance at pregnancy over a period of time.

278
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:56,620
The time communications are particularly challenging precisely because of these types of issues.

279
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,390
Anyway, I wanted to bring that up because it was a really critical thing. Keep going.

280
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:02,580
I didn't know that until this very moment, so that would've been helpful to know.

281
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:11,760
But okay, so I just got a little like overwhelmed and just went with the one that the provider decided to put me on,

282
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:17,130
which was the pill was on the pill for however many years decided to switch.

283
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:23,519
Actually, it was an idea which I didn't talk about bad experience,

284
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:29,100
but then I decided to get back on the pill, went to my doctor, looked at the chart again.

285
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:33,270
They already looked at it before I went to the doctor's appointment appointments,

286
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:37,980
I was nervous, like maybe I wouldn't be able to choose in the office.

287
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,809
So the doctor prescribed me.

288
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:45,810
Yes, which is like a higher estrogen.

289
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:56,040
So, um, and somewhere within the conversation about all the choices, I missed the fact that you can't be on Yaz if you've ever had migraines.

290
00:35:57,450 --> 00:35:58,200
And so.

291
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:07,640
I got on your horse and started to have aura migraines, which is like a really bad sign that you might have a stroke and like have a blood clot.

292
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:13,640
And so after like two migraines, I called the doctor and she was just like, stop taking it immediately.

293
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:22,550
You didn't tell us that you had migraines in the past and you can't be on my you can't be on this medication because you might have a blood clot.

294
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:24,840
And then that was like the end of the conversation.

295
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:31,940
And I felt really dumb and just thought it was ironic because I do patient education on a daily basis and I just had so much trouble.

296
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:35,630
Yeah. So, you know, a couple of things to highlight here and then I want to go to you.

297
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:46,010
One part of the problem here is the volume processing, the risk statistics, efficacy statistics about one thing at a time.

298
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:51,319
One problem processing is Harrisons of many different things.

299
00:36:51,320 --> 00:37:00,410
Side by side, all at the same time is a different a much more challenging problem, one which people with higher numeracy are better able to do it,

300
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:07,400
and people with lower numeracy able to cope with the demands of trying to manage many numbers all at once.

301
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:13,310
You know, one of the key pieces of Carolyn's story is not actually a number of failure.

302
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:21,230
It's a qualitative failure. The exclusion criteria for migraines has nothing to do with numbers.

303
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:26,720
It was an absolute. If X, then don't take this type of thing.

304
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:30,470
That is also risk communication. It's just not number communication.

305
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:36,080
We will spend significant amount of time talking about that kind of problem, but it's not a number problem.

306
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:40,520
It wasn't a five versus a ten problem. It was a yes versus no problem.

307
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:47,490
And lastly, I want to say there is. Just to reflect upon Carolyn's experience.

308
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:52,710
Like you do communication, you intentionally looked at the table.

309
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:56,250
There was not a lack of motivation to engage in the information.

310
00:37:56,670 --> 00:38:03,930
And yet you still had challenges. And that's another lesson that we need to bring in here, which is even though people,

311
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:08,520
even engaged, people often struggle when the structure of the problem is inherently difficult.

312
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:16,020
Okay. So I talked a little bit about when I was in medical school, I did a rotation in family planning.

313
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:19,530
So basically all day I was counseling people on birth control.

314
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:28,070
And when I started the rotation, like being a medical student and just being like a woman who's had to experience like birth control.

315
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:32,580
And I felt like I came in with a strong frame of reference and I felt like, you know,

316
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:37,560
I was biased and thinking that most women probably had some frame of reference in terms of birth control.

317
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:43,240
So I figured that we can probably have this conversation and that we would be like on the same page.

318
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:49,110
And I very quickly realized that that was not the case, but that my experience is not translate to other people's experiences.

319
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:54,570
So like after trying to figure out like ways and like tools that I could use to educate myself,

320
00:38:54,580 --> 00:39:02,549
like one of the tools that I ended up using was a visual aid to go through different birth controls, which the tool I use.

321
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:05,459
And one of the things I liked about it is it was like a tiered approach.

322
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:11,220
So instead of like just giving you percentiles, it showed you like most effective at the top and that like went down.

323
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:16,590
And then it also, but it still was like a ton of information.

324
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:21,839
I think that's one of the really challenging things with birth control counseling is that there's so many options and there's so much information.

325
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:27,389
So like even having that visual tool, I talked a little bit my recollection of like at first I was like, Oh, this is so great.

326
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:31,900
It's making it so much easier. But then I still realized my disconnect with some of my patients and like,

327
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:37,139
I had to really figure out like how you use that visual tool to communicate because you can't just say, like,

328
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:44,430
here's all the information here is it with some sort of visual aid that helps you understand, like most effective, to the least effective,

329
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:51,240
but like you also have to be able to have those conversations about like what you value because that's a huge piece of like birth control.

330
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:59,799
Management is like, not everybody's coming in. They're like, Oh, I want to have like a 99.9% chance of preventing pregnancy.

331
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:03,400
Other people are like, I don't want to have to worry about birth control.

332
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:06,010
I don't wanna have to take a pill every day. I don't want the hormones.

333
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:12,430
So I had to like really quickly had to learn how to use that tool to communicate risk,

334
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:17,319
but not just like risk and like what I initially thought was like the most important thing,

335
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:22,809
but like what matters to the patient and like their personal lifestyle seems so very controlled.

336
00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:28,000
The classic example where. A key piece of information is risk.

337
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,150
Information effectiveness is why you're doing this in the first place.

338
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:39,520
If you want to prove presumably you are taking birth control, medication growth in many cases, primarily in order to prevent pregnancy.

339
00:40:40,610 --> 00:40:46,970
And so the effectiveness at that matters. And it's not the case that we only care about.

340
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:51,420
There are there are side effect risks which we need to wait off.

341
00:40:51,930 --> 00:40:59,670
There are lifestyle risks. The I don't want to have the regret of having forgotten by pill is its own form of risk.

342
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:07,370
And people trade that off. Now, I want to come back before we get off of birth control to this question of time,

343
00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:12,170
because it's one of the more challenging things that we try and communicate.

344
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:28,240
So. I'm going to make up numbers.

345
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:33,630
I do not want to claim that I am remembering exactly what the current statistics are for different birth control that are.

346
00:41:33,730 --> 00:41:40,660
This is illustrative. But let's assume for the moment that we are looking at.

347
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:51,250
Let's it still. It has 98% effectiveness.

348
00:41:54,270 --> 00:41:58,990
Now, I've already mentioned this is. Over time.

349
00:41:59,010 --> 00:42:02,309
So if we really want to expand out, what is this space?

350
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:05,400
What is the population of instances that this is? Describe it.

351
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:12,420
So we try and describe what 98 out of 100 what happened.

352
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:17,519
Um, so when I think of this and I would try to like maybe communicate this to someone,

353
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:22,280
I would say two women out of 100 for you get pregnant with is good.

354
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:29,620
So two women out of a hundred. Over the course of a year would get pregnant at some point during that year.

355
00:42:31,010 --> 00:42:35,450
That's really close to having everything. There's a couple small, minor things I'd add to it.

356
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:45,059
One. How often are they having sex? So there's a there's a vagueness there in the sense of how sexually active is somebody,

357
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:49,560
because obviously it does matter how often you're engaging in sex in terms of how likely you are to get pregnant.

358
00:42:50,370 --> 00:42:53,790
Now, these statistics are over larger populations.

359
00:42:54,390 --> 00:43:03,340
So this is basically out of 100 women who are sexually active in whatever the average.

360
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:08,460
A sense of how often someone is having sex during a year is.

361
00:43:10,770 --> 00:43:17,510
Out of those people. We are not engaging in any other form of birth control because you could have other things.

362
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:22,330
Well, how many of them will get pregnant? Yeah.

363
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:32,460
Let's imagine you're picking a birth control method. You stop using it after a year.

364
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:41,140
So what is the effectiveness of this, say, for ten years?

365
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:51,530
I guess. How does this number translate into that?

366
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:58,220
Out of 100 women using this method of birth control for ten years of sexual activity?

367
00:43:58,580 --> 00:44:04,030
How many of them will get pregnant? 50%?

368
00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:10,300
Not quite. I think it's higher than that, but it's not quite it's like maybe 85.

369
00:44:10,330 --> 00:44:13,170
I can't do it. I can do the math if I pulled out the calculator.

370
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:24,160
If you've got 2% here, it's not two times ten equals 20 because there's a compounding factor here, but it's probably somewhere around 17 to 18.

371
00:44:26,110 --> 00:44:30,910
Are going to get pregnant over that time period. Now, let's do the same thing.

372
00:44:31,090 --> 00:44:35,750
But now let's say. Let's talk about. I'll pick a different.

373
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:45,660
And I guess I'm making up these numbers. I don't know if they're accurate, etc., but I'll make this number really easy.

374
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:56,600
Paul 90%. One year and out of 100 women.

375
00:44:57,540 --> 00:45:01,260
We have an order intended pregnancy abuse is.

376
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:07,560
Now let's do the multiplication times. Ten years. No, it's not a guarantee that everybody would get pregnant.

377
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:15,400
But it's pretty darn close. The multiplication down there is somewhere on the order of 70%.

378
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:25,890
So notice that. A one year.

379
00:45:27,550 --> 00:45:32,530
Versus a ten year. So this idea of services I get, I make up these numbers.

380
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:41,630
This might have been computational. Exactly right. But it's darn close.

381
00:45:42,410 --> 00:45:47,330
Notice how different it feels to look at the ten year numbers versus the one year numbers.

382
00:45:49,810 --> 00:45:56,230
When we represented over short time periods. These differences feel small, which is part of why some may feel like, well,

383
00:45:56,230 --> 00:46:00,910
maybe it doesn't matter which point, which method I use from an effectiveness standpoint.

384
00:46:01,390 --> 00:46:06,370
When we spread this over ten years, those numerical differences look larger.

385
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:10,090
I'm going to pay more attention to this statistic versus other things.

386
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:16,959
And if you want to get out of the space of a pregnancy, think about how we represent breast cancer risk,

387
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:20,140
how we represent cardiovascular risk, how we represent diabetes risks.

388
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:25,390
Do we talk about them in one year? Do we talk about them in five years? Do we talk about them in ten year lifetime?

389
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:30,880
This same phenomenon is going to occur in each of those communications.

390
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:41,650
And by the way, I want to be clear, I'm not saying longer is always better.

391
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:45,460
Longer will make you pay more attention to these numbers.

392
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:50,210
They will make the differences seem bigger. What?

393
00:46:52,150 --> 00:46:58,390
The point that was raised earlier that sometimes other dimensions are also important.

394
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:05,540
You think that people are going to pay less attention to. I'm not going to take the pill or not pay less attention to.

395
00:47:05,570 --> 00:47:11,300
How much does it cost? That might lead them to make a decision that isn't necessarily the best thing for them.

396
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:21,450
Format matters here. And again, this is a no mercy thing. Like a highly numerate person is going to be less influenced by this shift.

397
00:47:22,970 --> 00:47:31,410
And the lesson in my personal. All right.

398
00:47:33,270 --> 00:47:44,220
Following up on this idea, Amber. You're talking about asterisks, if I remember correctly, and similar kinds of different ways of representing the.

399
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:54,220
Yes. So statistically, one in five people, especially given that size, can have no symptoms at all.

400
00:47:54,550 --> 00:47:58,530
One in five people in the U.S. are walking around.

401
00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:09,490
And when I. And they also said that 60% of those individuals were actually in our age range,

402
00:48:09,490 --> 00:48:15,340
like between the ages of 18 and 25, which is like college student age.

403
00:48:15,370 --> 00:48:22,959
So in my head, when I'm thinking of one in five is a little bit more scary versus like converting that number to 20%,

404
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:28,240
because I think 20% might mean 80% of people don't have one.

405
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:31,440
So it's like, okay, that's more of a on the positive.

406
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:35,559
And I think one in five, I'm like, oh my goodness, this is 30 people in a classroom.

407
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:37,960
And it's really all it is,

408
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:46,840
is college students are known to be a little bit more or could be more sexually active than other age ranges and other things.

409
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:52,410
So it's a little scary when you weigh those numbers in the sense of one in five versus 24.

410
00:48:52,420 --> 00:49:01,450
So this is a concrete representation of a format choice that changes the way numbers feels about this is a classic example.

411
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:11,470
There are studies on variety of different contexts where it's exactly what you're describing, what in X compared to a percentage.

412
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:26,530
And in fact, one of the most reliable findings in the number communication field is that if you represent a statistic as one in X.

413
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:35,710
You increase people's concern about. Compare to, say, a probability.

414
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:42,920
Now I will come back to this.

415
00:49:43,190 --> 00:49:49,130
I take a very clear stand on it. Later on in this course, the moment, I just want you to pause and think about.

416
00:49:50,870 --> 00:49:55,100
Then would it be something like, I want to have that feeling?

417
00:49:56,120 --> 00:50:06,160
When would you be concerned? But again, the more numerate somebody is, the more that you have, at least consciously in your head.

418
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:11,570
Well, wait a second. These are the same things. I know you can translate from one format to the other.

419
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:21,719
You know that they're equivalent. That's what I'm sorry you were talking about.

420
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:30,570
One of the classic medical examples where no better sense is critical to maintaining health, which is warfare, which means.

421
00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:35,629
So my dad has a fever and he's had it for 25 years.

422
00:50:35,630 --> 00:50:39,410
So every month he has to get a blood test to see if it's working.

423
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:48,320
And he gets a call from his cardiologist to say, like, start doing a half dose on these days and a full dose on these days and every month it changes.

424
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:55,070
So part of what he does, he writes it down while he's talking to them and he hangs it next to his prescriptions.

425
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:59,240
So like every morning he knows if it's the half dose or the full dose.

426
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:03,890
Yeah. So a little bit more background here. Atrial fibrillation.

427
00:51:05,530 --> 00:51:13,929
Is Condition four, which elevates your risk of things like stroke is treated by using blood thinners.

428
00:51:13,930 --> 00:51:20,350
Warfarin being a classic example of this. Warfarin has a feature that you.

429
00:51:20,950 --> 00:51:28,839
It has an optimal range. If you have too little warfarin, it doesn't actually inhibit the clots sufficiently.

430
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:32,200
And so you don't get the benefit of too much warfarin.

431
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:36,760
You run significant risk of spontaneous bleeding and all kinds of negative consequences from that.

432
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:46,180
So this really, really matters that you keep the levels in your body at a certain within that range in order for it to be a beneficial intervention.

433
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:52,460
I will tell you a interesting story in just a second about why that breaks down.

434
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:59,360
But notice there's a step here. It's not just the dots. It's how it's operating within your body.

435
00:51:59,990 --> 00:52:03,379
So you can't just sort of set a dose for somebody and forget about it.

436
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:06,230
And they're right from that point forward. You have to keep checking it,

437
00:52:06,830 --> 00:52:12,830
which is why people like you don't have to have blood tests on a regular basis and then have to change their dose on an ongoing basis.

438
00:52:13,610 --> 00:52:20,420
So it has doctors doing part of this work right there, taking the results of the test.

439
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:24,980
How much work? How much warfarin was discovered in the blood test?

440
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:29,690
And translating this into, okay, do we increase the dose? Do we decrease the dose, etc.

441
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:37,180
But don't has to do a no mercy test to which a number of you talked about, which is this How do I try it?

442
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:44,000
How do I think about the number counting of how many pills do I take when I two or three of you talk about the,

443
00:52:44,390 --> 00:52:50,000
you know, twice a day versus every 12 hours versus morning and evening thing in terms of pills.

444
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:54,630
Those are all the same thing, except they're not the same thing.

445
00:52:55,850 --> 00:53:00,840
And there's some really nice research being done as a group out of Northwestern.

446
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:05,960
That's a really, really nice job, sort of. How do you simplify medication instructions?

447
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:14,350
To minimize the chance that somebody misinterprets what you mean into a different pattern of behavior.

448
00:53:16,330 --> 00:53:30,100
So warfarin. Why is warfarin such a unique thing? So I will tell you a story about one of the weirdest discoveries I think you have in medication.

449
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:36,330
Imagine, which is. As for Friend became much more commonly used.

450
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:41,580
Eventually, a number of doctors started seeing a weird pattern,

451
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:49,350
which is they had to adjust their patients like your dad's dosage in a seasonal pattern.

452
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:59,970
That. In the spring or in the spring, they had decreased the dosages.

453
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:02,400
The fall they had to increase.

454
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:08,250
Now, I might get this reversed because I'm not 100% sure I've got the actual sequence right here, but I know where this is going.

455
00:54:09,410 --> 00:54:13,700
Why the heck would you have to change the dose of a blood thinning drug?

456
00:54:14,540 --> 00:54:17,720
Seasonally added sunlight. Good guess.

457
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:23,210
No, especially because the pattern appeared to occur regardless of geography.

458
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:28,670
The people in cloudier areas or sunny areas were still seeing a similar kind of pattern.

459
00:54:29,510 --> 00:54:34,819
Yeah. If you build a temperature and like there, this is another reasonable guess,

460
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:39,350
but we ought to be able to guard against that by looking at, again, geography and what the weather is.

461
00:54:39,350 --> 00:54:43,160
And no, that didn't turn out to be it. Emily. Stress levels.

462
00:54:43,660 --> 00:54:51,290
Oh, good. Physical activity. Now that's going to close.

463
00:54:51,410 --> 00:54:56,540
There's one particular thing. It's dietary. There's one particular thing that this got attributed to.

464
00:54:56,540 --> 00:55:00,710
Ultimately, I didn't see vitamin C.

465
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:03,980
No. But you get a close fruit or that fruit.

466
00:55:04,950 --> 00:55:15,460
What kind of fruit? Fruit? Grapefruit in grapefruit has a specific chemical pathway that increases absorption of warfarin.

467
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:24,510
If you eat grapefruit, you drink grapefruit juice. More of the drug stays in your body totally after a whole bunch of patients dosages,

468
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:29,700
which is why most patients who are on warfarin is told explicitly not to consume grapefruit.

469
00:55:30,450 --> 00:55:36,060
By the way, grapefruit is not the only thing that has that chemical pathway. There are other things that the grapefruit is the most salient one.

470
00:55:37,650 --> 00:55:43,559
But notice well weird thing to have to think through like wait a second, I can't eat.

471
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:44,400
Why is grapefruit?

472
00:55:45,060 --> 00:55:55,110
Because it has this effect and the only way they were able to figure it out was because of this process of we have to monitor what the dosage is.

473
00:55:55,110 --> 00:55:59,220
And then we're like, why am I having to increase increasing? Because why are we having to decrease, decrease, decrease, decrease?

474
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:05,370
I add it happened in the same way across a variety of patients at the time.

475
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:13,660
I was on that story. So there's another one.

476
00:56:13,770 --> 00:56:23,080
Like, think about all the different things that patients have to monitor numbers for and then adjust behavior.

477
00:56:24,330 --> 00:56:30,720
More for your diabetic if your blood glucose monitoring weight.

478
00:56:32,810 --> 00:56:38,120
Blood pressure. Those are some of the simple step counts.

479
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:43,670
Fluid intake. Fluid intake. All of these things are quantified information.

480
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:53,190
That we may have intentional management. By the way, if you were trying to follow particular diets that we might get into carb intake.

481
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:57,960
Fat gram intake, net carbs.

482
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:03,990
The list goes on and on and on, all of which require numeracy skills.

483
00:57:05,670 --> 00:57:13,469
Like I want I pay attention to calcium intake because I don't dirty doesn't want more complications

484
00:57:13,470 --> 00:57:16,920
of my transplant is that most of my ability to do a dairy so I have to think about calcium.

485
00:57:17,430 --> 00:57:24,180
So part of my mathematical effort is that I have to think, okay, so I'm going to get 600 milligrams of calcium from this pill.

486
00:57:24,570 --> 00:57:27,629
And then there's another little bit of this. It's in the fortification from the cereal.

487
00:57:27,630 --> 00:57:31,860
And then there's like, I have to do this math in my head to keep track of how much calcium they take.

488
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:35,430
I numerate. I can do that. I don't mind doing it.

489
00:57:36,060 --> 00:57:40,680
There are many people who are less numerate for whom that would be just beyond the scope of what they're capable of doing.

490
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:51,850
I want to go next. Oh, yeah. Let's talk about surgeries. So.

491
00:57:51,970 --> 00:57:58,660
Yeah. Yeah. You were talking about what kind of surgery?

492
00:57:58,750 --> 00:58:03,010
I had appendicitis surgery. And in particular.

493
00:58:03,010 --> 00:58:07,899
The thing I remember from your music was you're talking about sort of like the challenge in

494
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:13,240
getting quantitative information about how likely certain side effects were going to be.

495
00:58:14,230 --> 00:58:18,070
Yeah. So it was a patient who had appendicitis. It was pretty straightforward.

496
00:58:18,690 --> 00:58:23,469
He had some information on his CD. It's not a perfect way to look at the appendix.

497
00:58:23,470 --> 00:58:27,700
So it was a little hard to see and the surgeon had mentioned that it might be possible that they couldn't

498
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:33,070
get the actual appendix out if they went in now versus doing like a medication regimen and going in later.

499
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:41,080
And the patient kind of was really stuck on that possibility of just like doing the surgery and then not getting like having to do it again.

500
00:58:41,260 --> 00:58:48,790
Right. And the surgeon, I guess I'd kind of stressed that. And when we came in as the medical team, we were kind of like, that's less likely.

501
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:52,209
So that not having been there for the surgeons conversation,

502
00:58:52,210 --> 00:58:58,300
so that sort of conflict of the effective present presentation was really stressful to him and he was really looking for numbers,

503
00:58:59,350 --> 00:59:05,350
which unfortunately is kind of hard to give. We don't have a great number for like everyone's specific situation,

504
00:59:05,890 --> 00:59:10,390
like a little bit of information but not like a great number for like how likely

505
00:59:10,390 --> 00:59:12,790
it is that they will be able to find it if there's a little bit of information.

506
00:59:12,790 --> 00:59:15,310
So I'm going to pause you there because this is why I wanted to bring up your story.

507
00:59:15,970 --> 00:59:24,130
So you're describing a situation in which there exists a risk chance that if you do, the surgery won't actually be able to remove it.

508
00:59:24,220 --> 00:59:29,690
You won't get the benefit from the surgery. We don't have clinical trials of this situation.

509
00:59:30,410 --> 00:59:34,890
We don't have hard quantitative data to back up the question of how likeliest.

510
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:41,350
So what do we do in that situation? One answer is we say, I don't know.

511
00:59:41,860 --> 00:59:51,760
I can't give you a number. What sounds like they did in that situation was shift to verbal terms.

512
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:58,239
Well, that's unlikely. I'm going to spend time at this class, probably next class, the class after that,

513
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:03,430
talking a lot about pros and cons of verbal terms when we're talking about risk communication.

514
01:00:04,710 --> 01:00:09,550
But let me ask you this. And again, I'm going to push here just simply as an illustrative piece.

515
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:18,200
Was the chance that that might have happened. 50%, you're sure?

516
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:24,889
But pretty much, yes, in the sense that, you know, that that that doesn't feel right.

517
01:00:24,890 --> 01:00:29,390
It is not a fair representation of the quantitative likelihood. Was it one in a million?

518
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:35,110
One in a thousand? I don't know. Was it 5%?

519
01:00:35,830 --> 01:00:38,970
I notice what I'm doing here. There's a space.

520
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:47,830
This is a risk where we don't actually have numbers. But it's not the case that we don't have as experts, we don't have probability level information.

521
01:00:47,850 --> 01:00:53,670
There is a range of probabilities that you and the surgeon or whatever would have said.

522
01:00:54,510 --> 01:00:58,560
Maybe it's in that range. And there are a range of probabilities that I can throw at you in here.

523
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:01,770
No, that's not it. That's way too high. No, that's not it. That's way too low.

524
01:01:04,790 --> 01:01:12,320
Probability knowledge exists within us, not always in quantitative ways, but we don't always communicate what we do know.

525
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:17,780
Like I've learned as a patient, ask the questions like I just was asking you.

526
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:22,670
If my doctor says, Well, that might happen, it's unlikely. I said, Well, unlikely meaning what?

527
01:01:25,670 --> 01:01:29,450
Is this five in 100? Is this five and a thousand? Is this five in a million?

528
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:38,060
It's a 50. What is it? Not because I expect them to be precise, but because there is knowledge there that can be extracted.

529
01:01:38,090 --> 01:01:42,750
They know more about what this likelihood is than I do. And.

530
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:49,350
A as a newborn person, that quantification has meaning to me.

531
01:01:49,410 --> 01:01:53,100
Now, there are people for whom going through these questions probably wouldn't actually help them any.

532
01:01:54,660 --> 01:02:01,050
But for me it was very helpful. And this is a habit that I've gotten into in terms of helping whenever I see an expert sort of.

533
01:02:02,010 --> 01:02:09,140
Hedge on, what is the likelihood of something you're able to say? Well, okay, if you can't give me what it is, can you tell me what is not?

534
01:02:09,150 --> 01:02:13,200
It's not this, it's not that, it's not this. Okay. So what is the space that invites be?

535
01:02:15,090 --> 01:02:20,700
At the strategy I want to give you guys, because it may come up in a lot of different things.

536
01:02:21,330 --> 01:02:24,569
I mean, we talk about it in health and you talked about it with a surgeon or something of that.

537
01:02:24,570 --> 01:02:29,280
It may come up in financial situations. It may come up in all kinds of other contexts.

538
01:02:33,370 --> 01:02:41,680
And just to follow up on that, Becca, you were talking about a similar kind of dynamic where instead of getting numbers, what you got was words.

539
01:02:42,130 --> 01:02:48,580
Yeah. When I was six, I had a mole on my head that my mom noticed was doing something funky.

540
01:02:48,580 --> 01:02:52,180
So she got it checked and the doctors told her that there was.

541
01:02:52,850 --> 01:02:57,890
But you didn't give her any numbers, just that it was extremely likely that it would turn into skin cancer.

542
01:02:57,910 --> 01:03:04,440
When I was in my early twenties. And so, I mean, they ultimately decided to go ahead and have it removed and do that whole thing.

543
01:03:04,450 --> 01:03:12,250
But when I was asking her about it, just after, like doing the readings and I thought of this and I didn't,

544
01:03:12,260 --> 01:03:15,520
obviously I was sick, so I didn't have a lot of information on it.

545
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:18,399
It wasn't really present. So I called her to ask a little bit more.

546
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:25,000
I just was curious if they like what the risk was like, if they gave her any numbers or anything like that.

547
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:30,010
And she said no, everything was explained to her in either likely or unlikely terms,

548
01:03:31,180 --> 01:03:38,739
including like the risk of side effects or whatever of me, like going under anesthesia and you know, all that kind of stuff.

549
01:03:38,740 --> 01:03:42,160
Like there were no numbers given to her whatsoever, which I thought was interesting.

550
01:03:43,210 --> 01:03:46,910
And once they were going to wrestle with more, of course, the next couple of weeks is how would we feel about that?

551
01:03:47,260 --> 01:03:54,639
Do we feel like our communication goals are achievable when this information is not, in fact quantified?

552
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:58,710
Where all you have is senses of something as being likely or online.

553
01:03:58,790 --> 01:04:02,600
Like we keep coming back to that question. Yeah.

554
01:04:03,460 --> 01:04:09,290
Yeah. I thought that was kind of interesting in the sense that like it might be uncomfortable with words instead of numbers.

555
01:04:09,310 --> 01:04:15,720
Like I had a situation, like I mentioned in my previous music, I got like completely shut out of my elbow.

556
01:04:15,730 --> 01:04:21,730
So I had to get reconstructive surgery. Like, from the nature of that, like, I have a huge screw in my arm.

557
01:04:21,780 --> 01:04:26,260
And the surgeon afterwards I met him play my post surgery appointment.

558
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:30,910
He was like, It's very unlikely you'll get sepsis, but if that does happen, you have extreme pain.

559
01:04:30,910 --> 01:04:41,020
Come back, you might have to take off your arm. And I was like, that's he was the he was a humorous man, but oh, yeah, it's joking, Doctor.

560
01:04:41,020 --> 01:04:46,010
But I was like on like a unlikely like, what is the chest?

561
01:04:46,420 --> 01:04:53,680
Like, can you actually describe that? It is like less than 1% of like, okay, I mean, that feels a little bit better, but unlikely.

562
01:04:53,830 --> 01:04:58,600
By the way, Max just used a phrase that I think is an important one for us to talk about less than 1%.

563
01:04:59,620 --> 01:05:05,740
And why did we talk why that is that that is commonly used it's commonly used in medical risk communication as well.

564
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:16,210
One of the reasons why it is commonly used is that we have difficulty concretely representing probabilities that are rare.

565
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:22,510
So there's 30, 35 people in this room right now.

566
01:05:22,510 --> 01:05:27,280
If I wanted to talk about 2%, it's one or two with one person here.

567
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:30,610
If I want to talk about 10%, we could talk about the other three people here.

568
01:05:31,450 --> 01:05:35,290
We can visualize patients who we get past 100.

569
01:05:36,810 --> 01:05:39,840
It's very hard for us to represent those kinds of small ratios.

570
01:05:41,570 --> 01:05:45,610
Reason why I want to highlight this is because there's an a key question that we're going to keep coming back to,

571
01:05:45,610 --> 01:05:54,370
which is, is there actual value to trying to be precise when the ratios are also vanishingly small?

572
01:05:54,530 --> 01:06:01,060
Like, would you really have responded fundamentally differently if they had said one in a thousand versus one in 100?

573
01:06:02,410 --> 01:06:07,810
And if not, then capturing the idea of this could happen.

574
01:06:07,930 --> 01:06:14,860
This is a possibility, but it is very unlikely, at least to give you that upper bound of it's one 2% or less,

575
01:06:15,610 --> 01:06:18,910
maybe in fact, sufficient for the purposes that you need it.

576
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:22,970
And it sounds like it was like you said, okay, it could happen. It's really rare.

577
01:06:22,990 --> 01:06:29,690
I'm going to pay attention to this. But you weren't. That level of precision wasn't necessarily necessary to guide you in that moment.

578
01:06:31,660 --> 01:06:36,459
All right. I'm running short on time. But there's one other big point that I want to make sure to get to.

579
01:06:36,460 --> 01:06:38,530
But before I get there. One small thing.

580
01:06:38,530 --> 01:06:48,400
On the other example I really wanted to make touch upon when you were talking, if I remember correctly, about skills.

581
01:06:50,090 --> 01:06:54,950
Which is another place that we use numbers in health in a weird kind of way.

582
01:06:55,370 --> 01:06:58,190
So let's talk a little bit about this because I wanted to respond to it.

583
01:06:58,970 --> 01:07:06,770
So in the health care professional where we give pain medication or when we assess patient's pain level,

584
01:07:07,070 --> 01:07:13,880
we tend to rate it from 1 to 10 zero 0 to 10 zero being no pain, ten being the worst pain that you can experience.

585
01:07:14,420 --> 01:07:23,630
And we tend to give medication accordingly. And we separate the pain skill from 0 to 10 into three different levels from zero through three.

586
01:07:23,900 --> 01:07:30,350
Consider moral pain or mistakes is considered a medium pain and seven plus is considered a severe pain.

587
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:39,140
And then we do give different dosage and different medication based on what the doctor prescribed on the level, like on the interval that you are at.

588
01:07:40,550 --> 01:07:45,830
So let's just think about for a moment how the number is being used to it.

589
01:07:46,010 --> 01:07:53,390
You're taking those numbers that are giving you and translate them into behaviors, dosing levels, whether medications are given or not.

590
01:07:54,740 --> 01:08:03,050
That is all predicated on the assumption that the patient is using the pain scale in something approaching a linear way,

591
01:08:04,430 --> 01:08:12,700
that the step from, say, a one to a three on the pain scale has the same degree of meaning in some pain.

592
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:16,960
That's scale of going from 5 to 7.

593
01:08:18,980 --> 01:08:21,980
There is not a whole lot of evidence out there that that's true.

594
01:08:23,550 --> 01:08:28,950
And in particular, I at least have observed I think there's evidence, research,

595
01:08:28,950 --> 01:08:32,880
evidence to back this up that there are certain populations, say, kids.

596
01:08:34,010 --> 01:08:37,610
They don't use the scale that way. They say.

597
01:08:38,940 --> 01:08:49,780
What's my pay? And the kid who is obviously in pain but is not collapsed in tears, in tears, he is not nonfunctional, says Ted Olson.

598
01:08:51,240 --> 01:09:00,590
They gave you a number. But their physical manifestation does not align with what the numbers should be.

599
01:09:00,590 --> 01:09:03,950
Meaning if you if it was representing what you thought it would mean. Representing.

600
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:13,810
But let's also note that the if the weight here is the upper end of that scale is worst possible, worst imaginable pain.

601
01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:18,490
Your use of that scale is different depending upon the level of pain you is experienced.

602
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:29,690
I am lousy at the pain scale. Because I have experienced bone marrow biopsies without general anesthesia,

603
01:09:30,530 --> 01:09:39,349
which is an incredibly intense but 10 seconds of pain that I could not possibly imagine tolerating if it were longer.

604
01:09:39,350 --> 01:09:41,510
But because it was only about 10 seconds, I managed.

605
01:09:42,850 --> 01:09:48,310
I then give pay and scores of like six or seven for things I know other people would give eighth or ninth or 10th for.

606
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:53,210
But that's because I have that alternate reference point. Yeah.

607
01:09:53,450 --> 01:09:57,620
Yeah. So this reminds me of something I remember when I was in high school.

608
01:09:58,220 --> 01:10:03,590
I hurt my back. It wasn't that big a deal, but I would just go to the chiropractor to kind of get it checked out.

609
01:10:03,590 --> 01:10:05,270
And I was filling out the form.

610
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:12,860
And the chiropractor actually told me that the insurance won't cover the appointment if you don't put a certain number on the pain scale.

611
01:10:13,130 --> 01:10:16,040
And so I was going to put a two or three, you know, it really wasn't that big a deal.

612
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:23,500
But then I ended up putting, you know, five or whatever just to get the point to pay for my insurance, which was not this kind of scale.

613
01:10:23,980 --> 01:10:27,170
This is yet another area which of course, is the problem.

614
01:10:27,170 --> 01:10:32,510
Whenever you build formulas based upon numbers, you want run the potential.

615
01:10:32,510 --> 01:10:36,860
If you're aware of that, that you distort the data in order to achieve your goals.

616
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:47,070
I could be in terms of pain, that could be in terms of, uh, other kinds of behavior, how often they floss your teeth.

617
01:10:48,740 --> 01:10:59,430
Well, I'm sure I report more flossing than I actually do so that my dentist is happier with me because we are just,

618
01:10:59,540 --> 01:11:03,709
you know, we have value to have someone behave towards us in a particular way.

619
01:11:03,710 --> 01:11:07,340
And so we adjust the data to to make that outcome occur. Yeah.

620
01:11:07,820 --> 01:11:14,390
It also makes me think of when you are analyzing something like the impact that a condition has on you.

621
01:11:14,870 --> 01:11:21,469
I can say that when I'm reading anything compared to my diabetes, it's going to seem equitable, essentially,

622
01:11:21,470 --> 01:11:28,520
because the looking at every 10 minutes, sometimes your blood sugar and going, Oh crap, I'm high.

623
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:38,240
Therefore I shouldn't go for a walk, but I should take a snack before and everything that's going on versus it makes my epilepsy seem small.

624
01:11:38,270 --> 01:11:46,420
But if you ask the majority of people in my situation for epilepsy, they would say this is a huge thing and it's relative.

625
01:11:46,430 --> 01:11:53,870
Trying to write things funny. Even if it's not actually numbers, it's still similar to the number.

626
01:11:54,110 --> 01:11:57,319
The number piece is an example of the larger phenomenon you're describing.

627
01:11:57,320 --> 01:12:00,860
One of the things I did not talk about on the first day, which is important to know,

628
01:12:00,860 --> 01:12:06,080
is that we evaluate outcomes relatively in comparison to a reference standard,

629
01:12:06,380 --> 01:12:15,350
historical standard, other people, etc., which is why your experience of one condition is set in contrast to other things.

630
01:12:17,070 --> 01:12:20,280
All right. So the last thing I want to touch upon, which is both really into the question for the day,

631
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:23,820
but it's also something, Saskia, you brought up in your music.

632
01:12:25,660 --> 01:12:34,180
Okay. So we know numeracy is important and we know that we need to get better at it.

633
01:12:35,720 --> 01:12:40,760
Let me do about it. You were sort of talking about, you know, how do we can we fix this?

634
01:12:41,780 --> 01:12:48,830
Yeah. I think it was the Peters reading, if I remember correctly, at the end, they talk about how,

635
01:12:49,370 --> 01:12:55,639
you know, there are these short term solutions to creating better ways of distributing information.

636
01:12:55,640 --> 01:12:58,850
But the long term solution, it can only be done through like formal education.

637
01:12:59,690 --> 01:13:05,900
And I kind of talked about how I don't really see that as a long term solution because there will always be people left out.

638
01:13:06,740 --> 01:13:12,860
For example, I got my families, a lot of immigrants who don't have formal education and either Bangladesh or America.

639
01:13:13,340 --> 01:13:18,320
So they would be left out no matter what because they didn't have the education that we do now.

640
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:24,530
So I don't want to first of all, I agree with you. I don't want to minimize the value of education.

641
01:13:24,540 --> 01:13:29,369
I certainly don't want to argue against more statistical education, helping people understand what probabilities,

642
01:13:29,370 --> 01:13:33,270
etc., etc. We can have a better education system and that has lots of benefits.

643
01:13:34,180 --> 01:13:42,920
But as you said, there will always be somebody left out. I subscribe to an approach that we might call universal precautions.

644
01:13:46,290 --> 01:13:52,620
We should, as best as possible, be tried to communicate numbers so that it doesn't matter what your education is.

645
01:13:52,740 --> 01:13:59,680
It maximizes the chance that you can get what you need from it. That is not always feasible, but is a.

646
01:13:59,770 --> 01:14:05,150
Is a. Objective that we can still hold out hope and strive towards.

647
01:14:06,290 --> 01:14:14,199
And. So that leads me to the question that I want to spend the last 5 minutes of today starting to think about and you can sort

648
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:21,519
of turn to your neighbor and talk about this is numeracy is something that is just very you are a high human person.

649
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:24,280
If you are a loner number person, you will always be that way.

650
01:14:25,970 --> 01:14:32,360
Or is numeracy something that we can train and maybe we talk about some general education, but let's think in there.

651
01:14:32,900 --> 01:14:37,340
If somebody gets diagnosed with diabetes and it's going to have to be measuring glucose like glucose,

652
01:14:37,340 --> 01:14:46,190
it has to be a dealing with numbers on an ongoing basis. Should our mindset be let's train you in these numbers or should I mindset be okay?

653
01:14:46,430 --> 01:14:51,320
You're going to always have difficulty with the numbers. So now we're going to build do something different because of that.

654
01:14:53,090 --> 01:15:00,710
Wrestle with that. There's no simple answer. But take a couple minutes and talk after having thought about numbers and numeracy.

655
01:15:01,690 --> 01:15:04,060
Do you want to think about? This is something that we train people on.

656
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:08,890
Do you want to think about this as something that we just assume is going to be fixed? How do we deal with that?

657
01:15:10,150 --> 01:15:14,530
This is setting up our conversation over the next week or so. So take a couple of minutes.

658
01:15:14,860 --> 01:15:20,520
And your neighbor. That's a better. Yeah.

659
01:15:22,940 --> 01:15:28,590
So there's like 30. I don't do their numbers like that.

660
01:15:30,990 --> 01:15:35,080
It's just like, hey, you're gonna work with them.

661
01:15:38,120 --> 01:15:41,350
I don't like it. I mean, it's a little bit of both.

662
01:15:44,160 --> 01:16:03,030
I don't understand why they didn't feel like they should have.

663
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:42,990
I guess I'm like no one like you just because that's how much it was going to be different if you were a mechanic.

664
01:16:46,050 --> 01:16:52,110
Every one of you have a way to find out where they actually identify it.

665
01:16:53,300 --> 01:17:06,130
Yeah, and it's really just about your mindset. Like I said, something like, you may have become like world class, but you can't.

666
01:17:07,470 --> 01:17:13,260
There's a lot of things, a lot of research Carol Black just talks about.

667
01:17:13,790 --> 01:17:26,280
Like, it depends, like not just our system is trying to do things about this so that it can get better.

668
01:17:27,420 --> 01:17:33,500
Get better? Yeah, I think so.

669
01:17:33,510 --> 01:17:38,399
I don't even the words translate very well.

670
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:40,560
And, you know,

671
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:48,870
it's interesting because they're like education and we're also doing a better job on the other side because there's always some kind of knowledge.

672
01:17:52,090 --> 01:18:04,889
Like I feel like I don't think it's quite clear at this point.

673
01:18:04,890 --> 01:18:18,120
929 Vincent that it is.

674
01:18:20,890 --> 01:18:32,060
Want to know what you are saying?

675
01:18:36,060 --> 01:19:12,070
I'm trying to talk with you guys. Yeah, I think that I especially like I feel like I have something to say about it.

676
01:19:14,060 --> 01:19:25,810
I mean, I feel like I know what I'm not going to actually ask you to support from your discussions, but we're out of time.

677
01:19:25,810 --> 01:19:32,990
And because I'm not sure they're using the performance as was completely setting up the question I want you to be thinking about as we move forward,

678
01:19:34,230 --> 01:19:42,060
we're going to spend time over the next week or so looking at specific formats for representing probabilities.

679
01:19:43,160 --> 01:19:50,030
You have specific formats for representing other kinds of health data, both numerically and graphically.

680
01:19:50,990 --> 01:19:58,150
And thinking about the ways in which those formats convey meanings as we go through that.

681
01:19:58,180 --> 01:20:08,890
I want always in the back of your mind recognizing that there are some people whose numbers they will be tracked into the graphic they will love.

682
01:20:09,100 --> 01:20:16,510
That level of detail will be others who are not who the numbers will feel like an extra burden.

683
01:20:17,320 --> 01:20:24,730
They have to think about this a number of times. They will be influenced by the format, not just what the content is,

684
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:32,170
and that that tension between the heterogeneity of different types of ways people respond to numbers.

685
01:20:32,650 --> 01:20:37,990
It's going to have to be important in guiding us thinking about what is the appropriate communication that we give people.

686
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:43,549
Maybe we sometimes we can tailor it one give one thing to one person, another thing to another person.

687
01:20:43,550 --> 01:20:50,050
And maybe we can't. And we have to wrestle with what's the best thing on average across the population.

688
01:20:50,470 --> 01:20:57,520
But keep this in the back of your mind. Today is the setup. It is to remind us that this is a skill, just like literacy is a skill.

689
01:20:58,030 --> 01:21:02,260
Numeracy is a skill or C is something that people find easier or harder.

690
01:21:02,710 --> 01:21:06,190
And in all the communication we're going to doing has to be thought through that way.

691
01:21:07,210 --> 01:21:12,000
All right. I will see you on Thursday and start driving that format.

692
01:21:13,720 --> 01:21:17,590
Professor, have you ever read the signal that it's over?

693
01:21:18,280 --> 01:21:22,299
No. I thought of it because you mentioned the weather.

694
01:21:22,300 --> 01:21:26,050
And I know I saw one of the readings. I think you talking about the weather forecasts.

695
01:21:26,050 --> 01:21:37,270
That's why the century is better for people to think that it's going to rain and be prepared for that precisely because of that.

696
01:21:38,020 --> 01:21:45,790
They think it's not family, you know, for medical people and systems to give them hope.

697
01:21:45,910 --> 01:21:52,540
Don't worry, it's a bit terrifying. And I was like, I didn't realize it when I read that some time ago.

698
01:21:52,750 --> 01:22:02,680
So you get on tracks now. It's how you convey information and what you think is really interesting and the way documentaries prepare.

699
01:22:02,680 --> 01:22:30,670
It's so, you know, it's all it's like there's just once there's the car will help you focus on what you learn.

700
01:22:30,910 --> 01:22:35,560
I don't know. It gives us a lot, which is not always the case.

701
01:22:35,650 --> 01:22:39,270
I mean, it's very problematic, but it's very. Yes.

702
01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:47,880
I certainly find in the past that I used to see numbers.

703
01:22:48,210 --> 01:23:00,030
Yeah. Thank you.

704
01:23:00,060 --> 01:23:06,210
I wanted to ask you a question. Yeah, about 300,000 times.

705
01:23:06,240 --> 01:23:09,660
Okay. But you used to have a feature where you could do.

706
01:23:09,660 --> 01:23:13,890
Let's do a comparison graph. Did that go away?

707
01:23:14,130 --> 01:23:20,280
So, short version. When was the last time you would say probably like a month or two.

708
01:23:20,940 --> 01:23:27,770
So we just. So what happened was that. I want to say about nine months ago.

709
01:23:28,720 --> 01:23:34,390
Site crashed because the host updated it in a way that the the programing failed.

710
01:23:35,530 --> 01:23:38,710
So we implemented a temporary solution.

711
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:45,670
And you may remember, depending on how long you've been using it, you may remember a previous version before the one that you recall recently.

712
01:23:45,790 --> 01:23:52,660
Yes. I mean, it was kind of like we just updated it like a month ago.

713
01:23:53,930 --> 01:23:57,530
And the functionality for doing side by sides are now back.

714
01:23:57,890 --> 01:24:06,950
Awesome. In addition, there is now also functionality to pull in to do a 20 by 50 grid of a thousand units.

715
01:24:07,550 --> 01:24:11,900
If we need to do that and to randomize.

716
01:24:15,900 --> 01:24:19,950
So that the icons are not all grouped on the bottom, that they are randomly distributed through the space.

717
01:24:20,160 --> 01:24:25,170
Okay. Can you do half a person? No. And that's Photoshop.

718
01:24:25,380 --> 01:24:39,090
That was an intentional choice. The reason why I think the reason why I don't like doing this as a person is because.

719
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:48,540
When you're using a personal icon, the proportion of color is not actually proportionate to the risk because a person is not a square.

720
01:24:51,160 --> 01:24:59,072
Okay. Yeah. So you get you introduce a bias there and then if you have to work in less than one.
