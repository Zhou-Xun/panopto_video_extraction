1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:07,380
So now we're recording I don't know why I have a picture that's awkward.

2
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:17,340
Honestly, I'm just going to sit. So when you go to Canvas, you should see a tab called Panopto recording's.

3
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,060
I don't think anything will show up now because it hasn't completed recording.

4
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:25,890
But if you ever have to miss class, you can just go and check the recording there.

5
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:32,460
Or if you felt like you want to review something again or you didn't understand or whatever, you can go back and review the recording.

6
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:40,230
It'll also have captions put in place and there should be a microphone here that picks up audio both from me and from everybody else.

7
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:46,860
So hopefully this is a useful tool. Maybe you've heard this from, like every single other instructor you've had in the last couple of days.

8
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,600
But yeah, we're going to do this.

9
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:57,540
So just just ignore it, but just know that it's there in the background and it'll capture both the PowerPoint and kind of like one pane or whatever,

10
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:03,720
and then us in another one. So welcome to Episode five or six.

11
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:10,410
It's just for me, it is just so weird to be sitting here in person, but it's so nice to be in a room with actual people.

12
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:14,580
This is the introduction to international health class.

13
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,220
And today we really just have a lot of housekeeping.

14
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:23,850
We're going to go over the course, overview and orientation and we're going to introduce ourselves and just kind of settle in to the semester.

15
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:33,120
So kind of no big expectations for today. And I'll also say the introductory kind of material and content is spread over today and Thursday as well.

16
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,630
We're going to be doing a few activities on both days.

17
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:41,280
So we're going to start off with some introductions and then I'm going to go over the syllabus and

18
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,980
assignments really briefly just so that we're kind of oriented and we know what to expect in this class.

19
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:52,350
And then we're going to do a very, very brief lecture and discussion like like fifteen minutes.

20
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:56,400
But just to kind of get us started by talking about what is global health,

21
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:04,650
because this is something that's just super important to actually just ask ourselves at the beginning of a course and in a program like this.

22
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:13,200
So let's introduce ourselves to our neighbors. I don't know if, like you all know each other yet, but this is your cohort for the next two years.

23
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:19,170
So everyone that you see in this room is another global health epidemiology student.

24
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:20,760
There are twenty seven of you.

25
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:27,630
There's a handful of other students in this room who are not global health MBA students, but who are interested in global health.

26
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:33,930
They may be taking the global health certificate, which is something else our department and school offers.

27
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:39,120
So there's a handful of you who are not students, but primarily everyone in your cohort is here today.

28
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,630
So I think this class is a really great opportunity for you all to meet each other.

29
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:49,380
So turn to your neighbor, make a group of three if you need to tell them your name and gender pronouns where you can set our home.

30
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,510
What's your main area of interest in global health?

31
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:56,790
I know you all told me on the first primary survey, which is really great to see, but now you can tell each other.

32
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:00,780
And then after about two minutes, because we're short on time and there's lots of us,

33
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:07,590
then we'll go around and you will introduce your neighbor to the class. So let's get started.

34
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:37,270
All right. I know how you and I go by.

35
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:56,440
Now. I was like.

36
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:24,990
Because I was trying to help you save my life.

37
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:41,200
There must have been all over the.

38
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:54,380
I was oh, yeah, I like.

39
00:04:54,380 --> 00:05:10,390
This. No one really knows that right now.

40
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:44,040
I know. I have.

41
00:05:44,040 --> 00:06:13,380
And it just looks like a lot of those guys got.

42
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:21,000
OK, and I really feel like I know what is going on.

43
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:33,480
Sorry, I just want to take some time, so wrap up and don't worry, you're going to have a lot of opportunities for more conversations.

44
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:38,310
I'm so sorry to cut you off. I just want to make sure we keep to time because we have a lot of stuff today.

45
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:42,570
So why don't we go? Why don't we start can we start in the front? Do you mind?

46
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:45,240
And just like introduce I guess, one of the other, you know,

47
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:51,590
the three of you kind of swap around and then we'll just kind of go through the rows and introduce our neighbors to the class.

48
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:57,120
OK, so this is kind. I made sure to protect yourself, to try them out.

49
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:02,430
This is Hannah. She's from Lansing. And her main area of interest is internal.

50
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:05,910
And this is Janet.

51
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:11,820
She is from China. And she doesn't really have an interest quite yet.

52
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:17,540
She's kind of getting used to the feeling of trying to decide that's perfect.

53
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:25,260
I just writing when she was born in India, raised in Canada and lived in the States for like 10 years from now for pronouns,

54
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:33,480
are she for hers and her area of interest would be closer to him.

55
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:38,370
That's great. Thank you. And address the class, not me. Oh, it's totally fine.

56
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:43,290
We can get back to you. All right. This is Audra.

57
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:50,280
She goes by she her pronouns originally from Cleveland or undergrad at Bowling Green.

58
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:56,730
And her interests are natural disaster recovery and HIV AIDS.

59
00:07:56,730 --> 00:08:01,950
This is team that originally from Missouri as well.

60
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:08,430
Their interest is on the question, Stephen, more specifically.

61
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:16,510
And then turns out this is Anthony Akers. He's from Chicago, but he went to Michigan State undergrad and he's actually in nutritional sciences.

62
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:22,970
But we're going to take them anyway. Hello.

63
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:27,810
I'm so sorry for being like, oh, no, that's OK. Please find a seat.

64
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:32,940
There may be one. Is there one in the. Oh, no.

65
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:43,590
I just want you to look at it if you want to come all the way.

66
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:47,690
No, I think you for it to be in the frame.

67
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:53,230
So can we keep going? Sure.

68
00:08:53,230 --> 00:09:03,900
This is Maggie also from Nutritional Sciences. Before announcing she prefers she is from Grand Rapids and she's interested in

69
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:16,230
women's health and reproductive justice and the possibility for Seabag products.

70
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:22,530
She's from Chicago and very interested. And then finally, this is Teddy.

71
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:28,950
He is, if he can pronounce his from Northern Virginia about 30 minutes outside of D.C. And

72
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:40,560
his main topic areas are surrounding counties in South America and the regions.

73
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:52,810
Go ahead. We're going to have to bounce that guess. OK, this is where it is and from is remembered and is interested in infectiousness.

74
00:09:52,810 --> 00:10:00,880
But this is Sophia, she's from Grand Rapids and she's going to interested in the.

75
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:15,110
Let's bounce this way to your group. This is a huge is from Los Angeles and she's interested in neurodevelopmental.

76
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:29,740
And I think they're gonna come up again and bring.

77
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:38,240
The bureaucracy is not going to be here for her, is she,

78
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:43,790
because she found out she's from the state and she's interested in learning more about the politics,

79
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:54,270
but she's interested in like health care and if it's different in different countries to.

80
00:10:54,270 --> 00:11:05,280
And everyone here. Yes, but this is how she got started, this she heard from she's from Southfield and she's interested in global health issues,

81
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:14,250
but she's interested in our knowledge of health issues, including.

82
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:37,040
And that's a very good thing for the program program program is really close to me, and he's interested in tropical Mr.

83
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:43,670
OK, this side of the room, we start in the front again. Yeah, so this is Maria Shriver announced.

84
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:49,850
She is from Virginia in Michigan, and then she's interested in health insurance.

85
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:54,620
Yeah, pretty much I'll go from here.

86
00:11:54,620 --> 00:12:00,400
So this is broke of year. Yes, I know already.

87
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:08,680
And then she considers New York her home. What are her main areas of interest is with water, communicable diseases.

88
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:20,580
Yeah. This is Becca. She's a sheer pronouns and she's interested in vaccinations and infectious infectious diseases.

89
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:30,720
OK, all right, this is going to her. She's from San Francisco and she's really interested in.

90
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:49,770
Indigenous health care, she her Eddie is from outside the city and and interested in learning how to deal with people in the world's largest bank,

91
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:53,310
and she considers home Dallas, Texas.

92
00:12:53,310 --> 00:13:02,140
And the main area is environmental health.

93
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:11,760
And so on, and so and so I can see how.

94
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:20,450
This is the first New Hampshire announcement from BattleCry slated for.

95
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:29,090
ABC, God see her. She's from the NRA and she's interested in HIV and AIDS.

96
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:43,920
Sailor. She is from Tulsa, Oklahoma, working with health professionals like.

97
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:53,050
This is Kennedy. She's from Detroit, her mother, her, and she's interested in infectious disease.

98
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:56,180
It has that everyone in Haiti.

99
00:13:56,180 --> 00:14:12,520
She's from Florida and Michigan without the person that she also went to school undergrad in Detroit, and her interest focuses on infectious diseases.

100
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:22,270
This is another janeck she uses she her pronouns, and she's from Florida, southern Florida, and she is in health management and health policy.

101
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:28,700
So she doesn't have a specific interest in global health, just kind of hard to get.

102
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:32,550
OK, and our two late comers, I'm so sorry you didn't get to be part of a group,

103
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:38,500
but do each of you want to quickly introduce yourself to the class so we can start with you?

104
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:43,440
Everyone, I'm Stephanie. I'm a Fulbright Scholar.

105
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:50,100
Oh, well, I work in Ann Arbor in January, so.

106
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:54,180
Oh, yeah. And you're working with Abraham. OK, perfect.

107
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:57,510
Good to put a face to it. Yeah.

108
00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:08,080
I will stay here in September and October. I'm going to fall back on my feet.

109
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:12,870
Needs about health policy strategies so outbreaks.

110
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:25,600
So I'm interested in this course. See, maybe some new things that I didn't know before I left, but at least you guys.

111
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:34,870
And I'm so sorry that my gender pronouns are she, her and hers and no Michigan, which is about a half hour away.

112
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:39,730
My main area of interest, well, is kind of like infectious diseases.

113
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:44,500
And I'm interested in the Southeast Asia area.

114
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:50,290
Great. Thanks so much, everyone. So I think we've got a really great group of people, a lot of really different interests.

115
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:56,260
I think throughout the course of the semester we're going to touch on a lot of what people said they were interested in.

116
00:15:56,260 --> 00:16:01,540
There's also some other topics. So hopefully you discover something new that you hadn't really thought about before,

117
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:09,460
especially for those of you who are just kind of in a very exploratory phase and still hoping to kind of learn and figure things out in the field.

118
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:15,850
So, yeah, I'm just looking forward to you all getting to know each other throughout the semester and for me to get to know all of you better as well.

119
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:19,900
And I'll say, if I do forget or mess up your name, please don't take it personally.

120
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:27,040
It'll take me like a little bit to get everybody's names. But we'll get there and I guess I can introduce myself.

121
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:37,180
So my name is Lindsay Kobayashi. I use Schiefer her pronouns. I'm from British Columbia, Canada, so I've been in the US just for a few years now.

122
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:43,360
I have a Masters and PhD in epidemiology from my Masters is from Queen's University, which is in Kingston,

123
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:50,050
Ontario, not too far from here, my Ph.D. in epidemiology from University College London in the UK.

124
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:54,610
And after that I did a postdoc in social epidemiology from Harvard University.

125
00:16:54,610 --> 00:17:01,720
So I'm really a social epidemiologist, I guess, by my training and experience and my research is on life,

126
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:07,360
course and social life, social and economic influences on health really from a global perspective.

127
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:14,410
And I primarily use harmonized data from internationally harmonized longitudinal studies of aging.

128
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:18,490
So I really focus on aging. I'm interested in cognitive aging and dementia risk,

129
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:23,200
and I'm really interested in how a lot of kind of the social conditions that we experience

130
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:28,390
across our life course accumulate and interact to affect our health in later life during aging.

131
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:35,350
And I think aging is really fascinating and important. It's kind of the time when we see the biggest divergence in health status and health risks,

132
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:40,000
and you can literally see inscribed in people's bodies the things they've experienced over

133
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,430
their lifetimes and how that affects their health and health inequalities in populations.

134
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:50,470
With respect to global health, I do a lot of work in South Africa as well as, again,

135
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:57,340
using harmonized secondary data from from several different countries, high middle and low income countries.

136
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:01,690
And we work on methods and approaches to come up with kind of unbiased and valid

137
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:07,440
ways to harmonize measures across very different kind of like cultural literacy,

138
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:15,940
language contexts in order to get good across national measures that are comparable for disease burden, which is very challenging.

139
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:18,880
We'll talk about I'll talk about that a little bit later.

140
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:24,490
One thing I do want to say is you might have noticed right now I've noticed because I'm sitting down,

141
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:27,940
I'm six months pregnant, which is super exciting.

142
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:34,330
And maybe this is time to pivot into, like the Koven discussion, which I feel like we should all kind of have as classes.

143
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:37,120
So that has that has two implications for this class.

144
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:43,870
One, and I think, you know, as public health students is something we're all super, super cognizant and thoughtful about.

145
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:47,650
That does put me I'm fully vaccinated, but it does put me at higher risk for covid.

146
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:54,280
So we're all wearing masks just like keep it up with masking and really like for this is for me and also for you as well.

147
00:18:54,280 --> 00:19:00,580
Like, if you don't feel well or if you think you've been exposed to covid, like please don't come to class.

148
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:06,370
And so I think I don't need to like plead with you to be thoughtful of like myself and all the rest of you.

149
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:13,270
I know there's a few other people in this class who have let me know that they're at higher risk for covid or are feeling nervous about it.

150
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:18,100
So let's just all be very respectful. Let's talk about attendance in a sec.

151
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:24,820
Like, basically, there is no penalty for missing class, but I'll talk about that in a little bit.

152
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:28,540
Yeah, maybe we should just talk about stuff. Oh, yeah.

153
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:31,360
And I have office hours and those are on campus, but yeah.

154
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:38,980
So the course Primeur survey that everyone sent out, I really, really appreciated the responses, both just getting to know you and your interests,

155
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:44,290
but also just kind of like things around covid how you're feeling about moving back to in person.

156
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:50,920
And that's like the things that people told me or not just kind of covid related, but also like what is it going to be like?

157
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,610
Like socially?

158
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:59,380
It's kind of stressful thinking about having to like, manage the workload of being in person, having like exams and assignments and things like that.

159
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:03,820
I definitely, definitely empathize and hear all of you with that.

160
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:08,050
And like I have mixed feelings myself about being back in person with respect to.

161
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:15,280
But I don't know how the semester is going to go. I think we still don't have like a ton of we're kind of seeing in real time what the.

162
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:20,680
To our like, with respect to transmission in situations where everyone's fully masked and vaccinated.

163
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:26,230
Personally, I feel like there probably will be some transmission on campus and like, I don't know what that looks like.

164
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:33,310
I personally don't know what the rest of the semester is going to look like from like a big picture university administrative perspective.

165
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:37,270
I definitely want things to be consistent and safe.

166
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:44,260
I don't have a ton of control over how the class is administered, whether that's in person versus remote.

167
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:51,250
But just know that I definitely empathize with concerns that people shared around covid risk.

168
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:58,370
And does anyone kind of want to share anything or help, like ask questions about that?

169
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:05,890
Yeah, I guess it's more of a just a question, but if we do end up in the same class, the question.

170
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:12,110
Yeah. So OK. Oh, sorry, you missed it. So this little thing here is called an owl, and it's recording right now.

171
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:16,550
And you can tell it's recording because it's little eyes are lit up. Yeah.

172
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:24,230
So you're on you're on camera. Sorry. Maybe I can quickly show what it looks like right now.

173
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:29,510
So this is. Oh gosh, you're right. And you're like I'm just figuring out how this works.

174
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:33,170
So this is kind of like a 180 or three sixty whatever camera.

175
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:38,480
So you can see at the top this kind of like a wide angle view of the classroom. And then you can see me speaking.

176
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:46,580
And for some reason we can also see the front row. Sorry. So there will be recordings and they will also have closed captions inserted.

177
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:57,740
So you can go to canvas, which is here on the this tab on the main page, you can click on the Panopto recordings and you can go back and review them.

178
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:03,980
And I'll talk about kind of like attendance and what to do if you have to miss class in a few slides, if that's OK.

179
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:07,100
So we're recording. Oh yeah.

180
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:14,990
And then the second thing that the like the implications of me being pregnant for you guys is like I'm going to give birth at some point, obviously.

181
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:21,320
So I'm due in December. And so that's kind of like really nice timing because like I'll be here,

182
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:28,880
but I will not I will be gone from the very last week of class, assuming knock on wood all goes well, the baby doesn't arrive early.

183
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,900
There's no complications, so it shouldn't be disruptive.

184
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:38,750
Just the very last two lectures. There's an alternate instructor stepping in and like if for some reason, for medical reasons,

185
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:43,130
if I have to leave early, she'll step in early or she'll she'll step in a bit early.

186
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:46,850
But just so you know, that's going to happen later in the semester.

187
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:53,150
Other people who are important to this class who aren't here today, but I will introduce we have an instructional AIDS.

188
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:59,330
We're very fortunate. We have Sarah Gal, who is a second year master's student in general epidemiology.

189
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:04,880
She will be in class with us on Thursdays. She has another class on Tuesday, so she can't be here today.

190
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,840
Her role essentially is to help with Kansas, with course technology.

191
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:16,880
She can answer any questions you have about any trouble you have with the canvasing, accessing assignments, uploading assignments, stuff like that.

192
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:21,140
She's going to coordinate with our guest speakers and she's also going to help me with grading.

193
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:28,160
And she also just wanted me to let you know that she's around to chat with any of you about any kind of like first year end questions,

194
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:32,660
managing time, managing your course load, anything like that. So she's like she's super nice.

195
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:39,200
She's a really great resource. And her email address is there. You'll meet her Thursday.

196
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:44,810
We're also really fortunate to have a global health librarian who was specifically assigned to this class.

197
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:50,720
Her name is Gurpreet Turana. She's the global health coordinator and information as to Talban.

198
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,530
And she she is just like an amazing person. You're going to meet her in a couple of weeks.

199
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:56,450
She's going to come give a lecture.

200
00:23:56,450 --> 00:24:03,500
She created the global health program at Twellman Health Sciences Library, as well as several research guides for global health students.

201
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:08,690
And we didn't click this link and show you, actually. So this is the global health program.

202
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:14,510
So there's a lot of kind of open access to resources that I think you might find helpful both for

203
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:19,730
your work in this class as well as for your internship and your eile in your second year or so.

204
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:25,250
These are resources that you can use throughout the two years in your program, not just in this class.

205
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:30,110
So I would recommend kind of going through all of the different resources she's put together here.

206
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:37,640
And what I think is even more helpful are these research guides that she's put together, and this is specifically for global health students.

207
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:44,870
So she has these guides on different topics. So, for example, you can click on each one and there's like a whole kind of Web page.

208
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:49,460
It'll show you kind of like mean links to different health and medical organizations.

209
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:58,100
This all for Kopans, obviously, covid specific stuff that comes up in the news, you know, data, data visualizations, resources,

210
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:05,960
Ebola vaccine policy resources and the stuff that's in these research guides can be really helpful for the assignments you have in this class,

211
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,540
which if you took a look at campus, you'll know about.

212
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:14,990
But we'll also go over so you'll see how they're really helpful for kind of assessing burden of disease and trends and things like that.

213
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:18,830
So definitely don't neglect this resource.

214
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:24,170
She's going to come give a guest lecture. As I said, she's also available for one on one research consultations.

215
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:28,010
And when you get to the stage of conducting secondary research in global health,

216
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:31,820
you can definitely take her up on that and she'll tell you more about it.

217
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:37,040
And then finally, the alternate instructor who I mentioned, this is Gwen Lee.

218
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:44,480
So Gwen is a research assistant professor in our department. She does research on undernutrition and infectious disease, mostly in Ecuador.

219
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:52,130
So she's the person who's going to step in for me just in that final week of class, hopefully not any earlier as your instructor.

220
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:57,170
And she actually taught this class for several years before me. So she knows it really, really well.

221
00:25:57,170 --> 00:26:05,330
And, yeah, it'll be the. Number six, that's the date she's scheduled to take before any questions about anything so far.

222
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:09,380
OK, cool. So an overview of our class.

223
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:11,630
I literally copy paste it. Of course, objective.

224
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:17,510
And I hate big chunks of text on PowerPoint, but I felt like this was all very important, so I'm just going to read it out.

225
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:24,140
So like the purpose of this class is to present a history of major approaches to addressing international

226
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:29,690
health needs and to give you an overview of mortality and disease occurrence in terms of geographic,

227
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:37,310
cultural, nutritional, environmental factors. OK, and we're going to review health indicators such as infant child and adult mortality,

228
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:44,420
disability adjusted life years and fertility rates like what are the measures that we use to assess health and populations globally?

229
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:47,990
Pretty straightforward, but pretty important foundational stuff to know.

230
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:55,040
And we're going to look at how we identify sources and qualities of data on global and country specific health indicators.

231
00:26:55,040 --> 00:27:03,230
So this is sort of a focus on secondary research for this course before you move into doing more primary research through your internship,

232
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:10,940
for example. And so we achieve the objective for this class through a combination of lectures, student led discussions,

233
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:16,220
collaborative note, taking on papers and then writing a midterm and a final paper.

234
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:20,840
So there are a variety of activities in this class, different ways of assessment.

235
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:26,660
And most of you said that you learn really well through lectures and discussions as well as kind of learning alone.

236
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:34,730
So hopefully the balance of different activities that we do kind of suits people's learning preferences, which I know are very diverse.

237
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:39,870
Any questions? OK, great.

238
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:44,190
And then before describing each of these kind of different activities for the class,

239
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:52,380
I wanted to place this class more broadly within the progression of the curriculum in global health, for example.

240
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:58,770
So this semester, it's your first semester. And we're starting out with this health of nations introduction to international health.

241
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:06,990
This is a very broad and introductory course. We're all coming up with different backgrounds and some sort of different starting places.

242
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:13,770
And so this course really has a focus on some of the foundational competencies in global health and also,

243
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:21,870
from a research perspective, has a focus on conducting secondary research, getting information from secondary data sources.

244
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:26,520
I'll also say I hate the title of the class. It should be global health and not international health.

245
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,290
And we can talk about why.

246
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:33,840
And I think I've just taken this class over for the first time, this academic year, which is something else you should know.

247
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:39,330
So it's always changing. And I appreciate feedback, but one changing the title of the class is one thing I want to do.

248
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:42,600
But that's maybe an aside for now.

249
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:50,370
Next semester in the winter, you'll take up at six six four, which is a field methods in developing countries taught by Dr. Alexis Handal.

250
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:54,570
And that is kind of the complement or progression to spend five or six.

251
00:28:54,570 --> 00:29:03,060
And the purpose of Epit six six four is really to prepare you to conduct your entire your internship in a global setting next summer.

252
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:09,420
And so this epic six six four is very, very applied. It focuses on things like research ethics,

253
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:16,950
I Urbis developing kind of culturally appropriate survey instruments and kind of focuses on like you as a researcher.

254
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:20,190
Most of us are from the United States, are from the global north,

255
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:25,830
who are likely most of us are likely going to go to a different country, probably a lower middle income country.

256
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:30,630
And what is kind of the appropriate way to conduct ourselves and conduct research in global settings?

257
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:34,740
So that's the focus of efforts to explore. And then you'll do your summer internship.

258
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:41,400
Great. It's going to be great. Get back and then you'll take up at six, six, five, which I believe is the winter of your second year,

259
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,820
which is a research seminar that kind of complements the Islay,

260
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:49,140
the Integrated Learning Experience or the six before that you'll do in your second year.

261
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:59,810
So you'll do kind of research presentations from speakers. So that's how this class fits into the broader global health progression of questions.

262
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:08,270
Great. OK, so this is an 80 minute class and the structure is the first forty five minutes or so, we're going to have a lecture.

263
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:13,610
I say it's interactive because I really want people to interrupt me and ask questions. It really is interactive.

264
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:18,200
And then for the kind of from three forty five until four twenty,

265
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:24,290
we end ten minutes before the scheduled and then time we have student led small group discussions before class.

266
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:28,880
There's always readings and this collaborative note taking on those readings which I'll talk about.

267
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:35,300
And there's two types of lectures. The first is kind of like a main regular lecture given by me for these lectures.

268
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,070
I provide the discussion questions.

269
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:43,460
I'll give you like five to seven discussion questions so each small group in the class will have the same questions,

270
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:50,180
the other type of lecture we have as a guest lecture. And so for these, we have quite a few guest lectures you probably saw in the course schedule.

271
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:57,620
And part of the reason for that is that I really think there are a lot of really incredible researchers and practitioners

272
00:30:57,620 --> 00:31:03,420
working around the world in different global settings who are really experts in their specific topic area of interest,

273
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:11,610
especially because this course has such a broad scope. And so I also think that, like some good things have come out of the pandemic.

274
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:18,650
And one of those is the ability to use technology like Zoom to connect with people who are other in other global locations.

275
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:27,200
I didn't want all of our guest lecturers to just be U of M faculty who tend to be from the US disproportionately white and wealthier.

276
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:34,880
I want us to hear from people who are actually doing global health work located in different countries around the world with very specific expertize.

277
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:43,560
And so I think that actually having some remote guest speakers call in is a really good way to achieve more diversity in instruction in this class.

278
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:53,300
I also say for the guest speakers, both the U of M guest speakers, because there are some as well as guest speakers who are located externally.

279
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:59,750
These are great contacts for all of you professionally when you're thinking about your internship or your Islay or even beyond.

280
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:02,630
So definitely keep those things in mind when you're thinking about what you want

281
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:08,400
to do for your internship and who you might want to work with the internship. And so these are really good contacts for you.

282
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:16,010
And so please feel free to reach out to them after hour before class as well and use these contacts for those guest lectures.

283
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:19,070
You guys are all going to provide the discussion questions.

284
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:25,400
So as the guest lecture is happening or before class, just think of at least one question for discussion with your small group.

285
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:32,120
And so you'll kind of be the providers of that content. We'll talk more about that and questions.

286
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:37,970
Yes, you mentioned small signs.

287
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:39,750
Yeah, that's a great question.

288
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:48,410
So one of the instructions that we kind of got as instructors is like to have everybody sit in the same spot in every class.

289
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:56,180
This is for the purpose of contact tracing. So, like, if there is a positive case in class, we'll all be notified.

290
00:32:56,180 --> 00:33:01,520
And I think close contacts of that person I think will be asked to test.

291
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:06,140
And so we need to know, like, you know, who's sitting next to him.

292
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:13,670
So try to remember where you're sitting. And then on Thursday, Sarah is going to come up with kind of like a class seating chart.

293
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:16,850
And then they've also recommended that when we do small group activities,

294
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:21,650
we just kind of turn and talk to our neighbors rather than move around the class.

295
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:28,610
I know that's not ideal because I do like to shuffle it up a bit and have different groups and they've kind of recognized that.

296
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:38,300
But I understand why. So for small groups, I think we can try to maybe aim for like groups of four or five people, according to our close neighbors.

297
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:45,940
But we can see how that shakes out when we do our first small group discussion on Thursday.

298
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:57,580
I know. Yeah, I'll I'm going to get to that in a couple of slides, that's a good question.

299
00:33:57,580 --> 00:34:01,610
Yeah. OK, so this is the grading structure.

300
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:03,360
So 10 percent is the course rating.

301
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:10,370
So the collaborative note taking on it, perusal, 20 percent are kind of mini assignments that come through the semester.

302
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:16,160
And then we have 30 percent each for paper, one in paper, two, which are like the midterm in the final.

303
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:19,610
And I'll talk about more specifically about those in another slide.

304
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:25,880
In the course, participation is 10 percent. So let's go through each of these to give you like I just want to be really transparent

305
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:31,070
about the grading and how it's happening and what you're graded on and why. So we're going to go through each of these.

306
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:35,480
So perusal is an app that's available on canvas. It looks like this.

307
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:38,150
And actually, I can show it to you really quickly.

308
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:46,940
And so let me actually just show you perusal, because I feel like that's an easier way to explain it.

309
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:50,510
Has anyone use perusal, by the way? A few of you.

310
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:59,360
OK, great. So you get you access perusal by going to canvas and then clicking here on the menu and it opens and kind of like a new app.

311
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:07,610
Perusal is basically a tool that has it's a tool for readings and doing collaborative notetaking, which is kind of exactly like it sounds.

312
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:12,830
So we have a folder for every single class in here. And then you go to the.

313
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:18,920
So to do your notetaking, go to the date of the class you're doing it for and then the readings will be there.

314
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:25,110
Most classes have one or two. I think that's one that might have like three go to the paper and just open it.

315
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:28,730
So it's nice because you don't have to download the PDF to your computer.

316
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:34,950
It's just here in your Web browser and you can read the paper directly and peruse also the reading for today.

317
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:40,490
Was this a really short thing on defining global health and where people are generally able to access it?

318
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:45,500
OK, and like access perusal within campus, if not,

319
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:50,960
go home tonight and try it out and you can always reach out to me for having technical problems with it.

320
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:56,510
But basically it's kind of cool because you can annotate your reading. So let me see if I can make an annotation.

321
00:35:56,510 --> 00:36:03,620
Maybe I can't because I'm a constructor. I don't know. But you can see when someone else has made an annotation because it highlights.

322
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:07,280
So I can see there's an annotation here and I can click on it.

323
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:16,010
And so someone has made an annotation on the reading and asked a question and then someone else has replied to it, if you want.

324
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:20,060
Like you might also hear from me, like I might tell you, that's a helpful comment.

325
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:24,500
Or I like I might say I also have the same question and you can do the same thing.

326
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,150
And so this is really, really nice.

327
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:34,250
I've used this in my classes in the past and it was kind of in response to student feedback that I've gotten that is not this different one,

328
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:37,160
that the readings were really done, some kind of hard to understand.

329
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:43,490
And so we started doing this and it was really a way for students to literally ask questions like, I don't get it, can someone explain?

330
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:47,300
And then someone else would kind of write their explanation for it.

331
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:54,410
Or if you see something really interesting, like, oh, I really like this, this thought like this makes me think of something else.

332
00:36:54,410 --> 00:37:01,280
Like I'm going to write down my reaction and then basically it of like start like full on discussions to see here.

333
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:07,400
And you can see that there's really nice kind of conversations that some people have started having around the text.

334
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:11,030
So it's really nice to see that some people have started annotating.

335
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:18,440
And so this is just kind of a way for us to read together and get more out of the readings and learn from each other.

336
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:21,980
I'll definitely say and pass classes like people have found this really,

337
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:28,370
really valuable and kind of like what you get out of it is kind of what you put into it, if that makes sense.

338
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:34,370
And I definitely recommend taking up this tool in classes where we have multiple readings.

339
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:46,970
Let me see if I can find one like don't feel like you need to go all out and give like ten comments like per class or twenty comments per class.

340
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:51,140
There isn't really kind of like a certain number I'm looking for.

341
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:58,040
It's more just kind of like the overall quality and consistency of your engagement with the readings.

342
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:03,410
That's what's important. So like if you're someone where like you're giving tons and tons and tons of comments,

343
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:07,250
but I look at them and you've written like interesting like that.

344
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:10,970
I don't think you're getting much out of that. I don't think others are getting much out of that.

345
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:16,790
But if you do like just a couple, like, oh, this is a really thoughtful thing I had or like I really didn't understand this.

346
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:20,390
Can someone help me? And you can ask that, like, there are no bad questions or dumb questions.

347
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:25,940
That's like another rule of class. Like, you can do that and like you'll be just fine.

348
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:32,030
So the great thing I think is just going to reflect kind of like the overall quality of your engagement and consistency of your engagement omeprazole.

349
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:35,780
Like, if you have to miss a week, fine. You can always go back and annotate later.

350
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:41,330
Like, I'm not going to dot points if you annotate, like after class because you were like super busy one week, that's fine.

351
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:44,660
But like, it's really like the reason for it is really that it's the.

352
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:50,360
For you to help you get the most as possible out of the first three.

353
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:56,240
Yeah. And I just kind of said here like, don't comment just for the sake of it. Comment on things that really grab you.

354
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:02,060
Yeah. Where are we going to talk about any questions or comments later on?

355
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:05,450
That's a good question. Honestly, we may or may not have time to.

356
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:10,100
I think if we have time, like like I will always read the annotations before class.

357
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:16,910
And I think if there's kind of like points that keep coming up, I can integrate them into the lecture and we can talk about it.

358
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:21,530
I don't think we'll have a ton of time to go through them and a lot of detail.

359
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:25,400
But they can also come back up during the discussion groups.

360
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:31,760
So like in in lectures where I assign discussion questions, if your group wants,

361
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:39,330
you can pivot and talk about something else, including the comments that came up on perusal.

362
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:51,170
Yeah, that's a good question. Yeah, OK, so transparently didn't do anything that's totally fine, they can still go like we did.

363
00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:57,350
Yeah, yeah. So that's fine. If you saw on canvas, like for today's reading, you're not being graded on today's reading.

364
00:39:57,350 --> 00:40:03,020
I just put it there as kind of like a practice just to make sure you can access perusal and know how to use it and what it's for.

365
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:10,370
So don't worry about today, but do take a look at the reading. It's useful. Yeah, um, assignments.

366
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:18,620
So there's kind of six mini assignments throughout the semester. These are them listed here, their titles and dates, six assignments.

367
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:21,830
Seems like a lot in addition to two papers. But I promise you,

368
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:29,810
it's not because the purpose of these assignments is actually to help break all the tasks needed for the midterm and final papers into smaller,

369
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:36,200
more manageable chunks. So if you go look at the assignments on canvas, you'll find that assignments one,

370
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:41,570
two and three are like three pieces that you'll need to do anyway to write the midterm paper.

371
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:48,860
And then four or five and six kind of in addition to one, two and three are pieces that you'll need to write and put together anyway for the final.

372
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:54,050
So these are really meant to kind of help you along and not have the midterm and final be like these huge,

373
00:40:54,050 --> 00:41:01,850
massive things that are really stressful when they do come up. And so the instructions for each assignment are on campus.

374
00:41:01,850 --> 00:41:05,780
They are very straightforward, I think, at least.

375
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:09,110
So you can access the assignments by scrolling down here.

376
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:14,510
They're in green or else you can go up to assignments and then you'll also see them listed here.

377
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:19,190
So let's look at the first one and the first one is not due until September twenty first.

378
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:28,700
And you'll notice this is like I think five days after Gurpreet does her lecture on information and research and data sources and global health.

379
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:34,730
So that lecture should be helpful for this and the rest of them. The instructions are here in a word document.

380
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:42,620
And like, these are really straightforward. So you'll you know, what country have selected, what our health indicators and why we look at them.

381
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:48,830
And then here are some key indicators for the country you've chosen. So they're very short.

382
00:41:48,830 --> 00:41:53,690
I will suggest sources of information to find the different things that are asked for.

383
00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:56,630
And each assignment, you don't need to stick to these.

384
00:41:56,630 --> 00:42:03,710
But if you do use other sources, just say kind of at the bottom of your table, like here, the source, for example.

385
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:07,130
Um, yeah. And so you can go through them at your leisure and take a look.

386
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:15,710
But they are really like they're really manageable, I think. And the grading the assignments are worth twenty percent because they're so small

387
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:19,340
and because they're kind of pieces that go towards the midterm in the final,

388
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:25,820
the grading is not going to be like there isn't really kind of a strict or intense rubric for them.

389
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:30,770
I think as long as you have done the assignment and filled in reasonable information,

390
00:42:30,770 --> 00:42:36,020
the grading is just going to reflect that you really kind of done it and done it in a reasonable way.

391
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:42,170
So I wouldn't worry too much about the grading on these. Any questions?

392
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:46,580
Yeah, so since the grading is kind of relaxed on these assignments,

393
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:51,030
will they get like feedback on them, whether we even amp up some things in the section?

394
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:55,700
Yeah, it's going to go into the papers that are more integrated, I guess.

395
00:42:55,700 --> 00:43:01,730
Yeah. Yeah. You can expect some feedback. So the assignments differ a little bit in terms of like the level of detail,

396
00:43:01,730 --> 00:43:06,140
like there's some words like write two hundred words on this thing and if you're like way off base,

397
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:12,350
I'll definitely give you some comments on it that are kind of intended to help help you along.

398
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:19,970
But I want to say they're almost like a completion mark, but they're not really if like if you turn in something that's just completely like,

399
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:24,980
I don't know where you found this information, but then, like, we'll have a chat.

400
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:30,050
But I think, yeah, like, these are really these assignments are really like for you to help break the

401
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:35,000
midterm and final into smaller pieces and to kind of get feedback along the way.

402
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:41,020
Yeah. So the topics that we choose to do, the independent assignments, that's the same topic.

403
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:44,090
I'm going to write off a great question.

404
00:43:44,090 --> 00:43:51,680
So you are not required and maybe actually can I introduce the midterm and then answer your question, because I feel like that flows together.

405
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:57,560
Well, so the midterm, the topic isn't about the epidemiology of a selected health condition.

406
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:04,010
So you'll be asked to research the epidemiology of a health condition, of your choice in a country of your choice.

407
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:08,480
And you'll be asked to summarize that health condition across socio demographic or other

408
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:14,450
categories of as appropriate and as available for the population that you've selected.

409
00:44:14,450 --> 00:44:20,120
And so, as you might guess, like going back to assignment one, like whatever country you choose for assignment one,

410
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:26,090
it kind of makes sense to do your midterm on that same country because you started to do research into it.

411
00:44:26,090 --> 00:44:36,050
So I will say, like definitely spend a lot of time up front thinking about the country and population and health condition you're interested in,

412
00:44:36,050 --> 00:44:42,520
because that'll make everything more efficient throughout the whole semester. If you do like assignment one, two, even three.

413
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:47,230
However far you get and you decide you're really unhappy with what you chose and you're just not finding good data.

414
00:44:47,230 --> 00:44:51,670
It's fine, you can switch, but I would that's a little bit less efficient.

415
00:44:51,670 --> 00:44:59,170
Right. So I would like definitely recommend putting some upfront time into thinking through, like, what country you'd want to choose.

416
00:44:59,170 --> 00:45:07,570
And then same thing for the final. This is going to build on the midterm where you will be asked to summarize and comment

417
00:45:07,570 --> 00:45:12,160
on current programmatic or policy responses to that health condition in the population.

418
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:21,100
Our country selected for paper one. So depending on kind of the context of the health condition in the country you've chosen,

419
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:23,860
you might have something that addresses it at a national level,

420
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:30,130
but you might go more specific to a particular population or subpopulation within that country.

421
00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:33,550
So if you've chosen like like a child health condition,

422
00:45:33,550 --> 00:45:37,900
then obviously your population of interest is going to be children if you have another and there

423
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:42,460
are certain health conditions that are more prevalent in certain populations and things like that.

424
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:47,980
So it doesn't necessarily need to be like an entire country by the time you get to paper two.

425
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:52,300
And I'm sure most people actually choose something more specific for people for paper, too,

426
00:45:52,300 --> 00:46:00,820
because it is much more tractable to develop like a really kind of specific programmatic intervention for a smaller population or community.

427
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:06,550
So you're going to propose a new program of activities to complement the work that is already ongoing.

428
00:46:06,550 --> 00:46:10,730
So the midterm is due October twenty first the final on December 9th.

429
00:46:10,730 --> 00:46:16,930
That's the last day of class. So it's due on the last day of class just so you can have a break and like kind of take

430
00:46:16,930 --> 00:46:20,980
time to prepare for your other finals that are going to be after the class period.

431
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:30,100
And so hopefully that's kind of actually a nice timing. You'll also notice all the assignments and papers are due at 3:00 p.m. on the last day.

432
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:34,150
And the reason why they do it three p.m. and not like midnight is because I don't

433
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:38,950
want people working up until midnight on the deadline day of a paper to get it done.

434
00:46:38,950 --> 00:46:46,060
Like, that's tiring. It's stressful. Like I want you to turn your papers in and then be able to go home and relax after class.

435
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:50,770
Like I remember what it's like to be a student and I remember what it's like to be up really late working on assignments.

436
00:46:50,770 --> 00:46:55,820
So I don't want people doing that on the day something to do, which is why I do earlier in the day.

437
00:46:55,820 --> 00:47:01,510
Having said that, if you need an extension, one hundred percent, fine, just email me, give me a heads up.

438
00:47:01,510 --> 00:47:08,290
And I'm fine with granting extensions like I know stuff goes on in life and it's really, really OK.

439
00:47:08,290 --> 00:47:15,520
Having said that, if you do like submit a paper late and you don't ask for an extension or you just kind of like don't communicate with me.

440
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:21,520
And sometimes I understand that emergencies happen and like, we can talk about that and come to like an arrangement.

441
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:28,480
But it's like I don't hear from you and you submit it like a few days late, like there is a deduction for a policy.

442
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:33,280
And I think it's something like five percentage points per twenty four hours if you don't give me a heads up.

443
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:38,470
But generally, like, I'm really fine with extensions. If you did give me a heads up. Yeah.

444
00:47:38,470 --> 00:47:43,930
And then for the midterm and final instructions, tips, examples in the full grading rubric are on campus.

445
00:47:43,930 --> 00:47:48,940
I want it to be as transparent as possible. So go through those at your own leisure and then we're going to talk about the in the

446
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:54,040
file in more detail in class about a month before each of them is do the final thing.

447
00:47:54,040 --> 00:48:00,640
I'll say I'm sorry I'm talking so much about these. The final thing I'll say is that it doesn't you can choose any country you want.

448
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:06,310
It doesn't necessarily need to be like a lower middle income country and global health.

449
00:48:06,310 --> 00:48:10,900
You can you can choose any country you want. It can also be a high income country.

450
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:17,440
You can choose Gurpreet tonight. We're actually talking about this before the semester started.

451
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:22,330
Like what about like if someone wants to choose a country that's in transition or very unstable right now,

452
00:48:22,330 --> 00:48:30,430
like Afghanistan and like you definitely can. But I would just think critically about kind of like what is the context of the

453
00:48:30,430 --> 00:48:34,360
country that you're going to work with and what is the availability of data.

454
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:42,970
So, for example, trying to get like very recent twenty, twenty one data on health indicators in Afghanistan might be difficult, like going forward.

455
00:48:42,970 --> 00:48:50,170
Thinking about planning, like a programmatic intervention in Afghanistan also might be difficult, like are we going to work with the Taliban?

456
00:48:50,170 --> 00:48:55,390
So those are I mean, you can propose it if you want, like seriously if you want, you can go for it.

457
00:48:55,390 --> 00:49:03,280
But I think just kind of those kinds of things are good to think about when you are kind of planning for this and you can definitely choose,

458
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:09,340
there's going to be more challenging context to work in socially and politically, and there's going to be less challenging contexts.

459
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:11,980
But those are kind of things you'll want to think about as you're choosing kind

460
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:17,290
of like the country and population and health condition you're interested in.

461
00:49:17,290 --> 00:49:23,500
Yeah. Do you people often find it difficult in terms of like knitting in other countries together?

462
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:29,770
In terms of what? Sorry, like government. It's really gathered data gathering permits to gather data.

463
00:49:29,770 --> 00:49:35,170
Oh my gosh. I think. Yes, yeah, yeah.

464
00:49:35,170 --> 00:49:41,410
So like for the purpose of this class, like for the assignments and papers, they're all going to be secondary data.

465
00:49:41,410 --> 00:49:48,170
So you're going to do. Things like go to the WHL or UN website or the World Bank for economic data to

466
00:49:48,170 --> 00:49:52,010
get information on the different indicators that you're going to incorporate.

467
00:49:52,010 --> 00:49:56,510
So like thinking about paper one, for example, like what's my burden of disease?

468
00:49:56,510 --> 00:50:03,380
Let's say I choose like tuberculosis. I'll probably want like an incident and a prevalence rate in the overall population, like my age and sex.

469
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:10,610
Maybe over time. Those data are often those kinds of data are often collected by bodies like the WHL.

470
00:50:10,610 --> 00:50:15,680
So you can find them. But the show might not even have them for all countries,

471
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:25,160
like when countries go through periods of war or like political turmoil or things like that, that we might not have data available.

472
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:33,350
And so that might make paper one challenging and might make paper two more challenging because we can't get a good grasp on the burden of disease.

473
00:50:33,350 --> 00:50:38,420
And it might make the kind of social and political situation difficult to work with.

474
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:44,840
And so it depends on the extent of our NGOs able to work in that country and things like that.

475
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:48,170
So those are kind of things that you would want to take into consideration.

476
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:53,540
And that's something that I also would like to start considering our internships.

477
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:57,990
Oh, for sure. Yeah. I worked with some organizations that are based in.

478
00:50:57,990 --> 00:51:05,070
Just do that, even though some people have to go back and search warrants.

479
00:51:05,070 --> 00:51:12,090
Yeah, that sounds stressful. And this is definitely something you're going to want to think about with your internships in the summer, too.

480
00:51:12,090 --> 00:51:18,930
And I think the university probably has guidance as well as like the US State Department on the safety of travel to places for you personally,

481
00:51:18,930 --> 00:51:22,470
as well as like the social political context.

482
00:51:22,470 --> 00:51:28,380
You'll also, I think about with covid like what that's done to different countries as well for the internship.

483
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:33,450
I know there will be a there might have already been kind of like a global health kick off thing, I'm not sure.

484
00:51:33,450 --> 00:51:42,320
But there will be several meetings, the kind of information sessions on internships throughout the fall.

485
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:47,690
OK, we're going to move on participation, so this is 10 percent of your grade, basically,

486
00:51:47,690 --> 00:51:51,500
like you will be fine for your participation grade if you come to class,

487
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:56,430
participate in discussions, ask questions, interrupting me during lectures, allowed.

488
00:51:56,430 --> 00:52:01,440
It's encouraged. I also know that, like a lot of this is also dependent on personality.

489
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:08,180
Some people like to talk more in class. Others are kind of like prefer to talk less and engage less kind of verbally in person.

490
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:12,110
And that's totally fine. And that's something that I do take into consideration.

491
00:52:12,110 --> 00:52:18,710
Like, I noticed this. And so, like, I'm not like saying you need to be like the most talkative person in class and you'll get the best grade.

492
00:52:18,710 --> 00:52:22,610
So that's something I definitely take into consideration with participation.

493
00:52:22,610 --> 00:52:26,690
So just kind of like I just think like a good faith effort to come to class regularly

494
00:52:26,690 --> 00:52:30,650
and engage with what we're doing is like what's important for participation.

495
00:52:30,650 --> 00:52:34,550
And again, participation is for your own benefit. It's not for my benefit. Right.

496
00:52:34,550 --> 00:52:40,010
So, like, the more you put into this class, just like with your mom in general, the more you get out of it.

497
00:52:40,010 --> 00:52:47,180
Like I said earlier, if you miss class, you will not be penalized. There are no penalties for missing class like the exception is sort of like if it

498
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:51,950
becomes regular and you're just not coming to class and there's no explanation, I don't hear from you.

499
00:52:51,950 --> 00:52:56,090
If that happens, I'll reach out to you to make sure everything's OK.

500
00:52:56,090 --> 00:53:01,310
But if you can't make it to class, just let me know in advance, if possible, so that I know what's going on.

501
00:53:01,310 --> 00:53:07,270
And I know, like if I need to reach out to support you or anything like that. So I'm good.

502
00:53:07,270 --> 00:53:14,150
Yeah, we have like a limit on the amount of practice and this is out.

503
00:53:14,150 --> 00:53:15,470
There isn't really a limit.

504
00:53:15,470 --> 00:53:23,120
Like any time you have to miss class, just let me know in advance if you can, even if it's like the morning of, like, something's come up.

505
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:25,340
But I know sometimes, again, like emergencies happen.

506
00:53:25,340 --> 00:53:29,360
Like if you have an accident or you're sick or just like something happens, then just let me know.

507
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:33,770
Like with once you're kind of able to like what kind of went on.

508
00:53:33,770 --> 00:53:41,480
And I say there isn't a limit because like like if someone becomes like severely ill and just like really can't come to class for like a month,

509
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:44,510
like, there's no I'm not going to penalize you, you know.

510
00:53:44,510 --> 00:53:50,060
So I think just kind of like with reasonable like just with reasonable notice and to a reasonable extent.

511
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:56,300
But if you really disappear or like you're really like your regular and like inconsistent and coming to class and like you're

512
00:53:56,300 --> 00:54:02,030
not letting me know and you're not really kind of like putting in kind of like a good faith effort with the class like that.

513
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:07,010
I think there would be a penalty for that. Does that sound reasonable?

514
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:14,590
OK, cool. Um, and then if you do have to miss class, I'm going to do actually so I said weekly discussion thread here.

515
00:54:14,590 --> 00:54:18,290
I do like a discussion thread, like for each lecture session.

516
00:54:18,290 --> 00:54:23,900
If you do miss class, just kind of share any comments or thoughts that you had on the readings or the discussion,

517
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:29,480
questions that are in the slides like on that discussion thread. And then also alternatively, like,

518
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:34,760
if you have anything extra you want to say you wanted to say that you felt like you didn't get to say in class or

519
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:39,590
you felt like you didn't want to speak up in front of everybody and you feel more comfortable posting online.

520
00:54:39,590 --> 00:54:49,010
You can also do that. So that will be an option as well. Um, we're almost out of the interest and we'll have a short lecture.

521
00:54:49,010 --> 00:54:54,530
What makes a good discussion? Question. So think about group discussions you've had in the past.

522
00:54:54,530 --> 00:55:02,470
What makes a good question to stimulate discussion? It's open ended.

523
00:55:02,470 --> 00:55:14,860
Yeah, definitely. What else?

524
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:27,390
Tea, and then it all started back in 2010 and then the question of whether.

525
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:32,850
Yeah, definitely so kind of giving the context of where you're coming from and asking the question, what's the object?

526
00:55:32,850 --> 00:55:38,600
And then gives people an opportunity to kind of branch out from it. Definitely.

527
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:42,980
I wanted to say almost, yes.

528
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:49,970
So to have this subject. Yeah, absolutely.

529
00:55:49,970 --> 00:55:59,790
Anything else? Yeah, that's a good one.

530
00:55:59,790 --> 00:56:04,040
Yeah. Yeah. Not something that we're just, like, totally in unison. We agree. Yeah.

531
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:09,110
Like the Taliban. Is that. Yeah. Um, yeah, that's a good one.

532
00:56:09,110 --> 00:56:14,180
And actually we're going to do kind of building on that on Thursday in class.

533
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:23,060
We're kind of go to our small groups and come up with kind of community guidelines and talk about kind of like, not like our ETA.

534
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:29,450
That's the wrong word kind of things about like as a class like we're going to talk about some topics that are difficult,

535
00:56:29,450 --> 00:56:38,540
that require kind of like kind of a sensitivity and thoughtfulness to different cultures, different communities, different populations.

536
00:56:38,540 --> 00:56:44,000
We're going to talk about issues, I'm sure, like sexism, racism, various forms of isms,

537
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:48,230
and how these things also play out on a global scale, too, as well.

538
00:56:48,230 --> 00:56:56,210
And inequalities between countries are kind of like neo colonial approaches to global health and why fads like these are really complicated things.

539
00:56:56,210 --> 00:57:00,110
And we're just going to kind of talk as a class like how we address some of these

540
00:57:00,110 --> 00:57:06,290
difficult topics and express ourselves around difficult topics without kind of like,

541
00:57:06,290 --> 00:57:11,180
I guess like hurting each other or being punitive or like feeling like we can't say things.

542
00:57:11,180 --> 00:57:17,930
So like when we have like when we experience differences in opinions or get into arguments like how do we do

543
00:57:17,930 --> 00:57:21,950
that and how do we do that in a way that is thoughtful and respectful and lets us all like express ourselves.

544
00:57:21,950 --> 00:57:31,560
So that's a really, really good point. Yeah. Final things think, but.

545
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:41,400
OK, yeah, so basically kind of like what everybody just said, like you want people to think critically in order to answer your discussion question,

546
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:48,810
good questions, require answering the question, requires making a judgment, combining ideas, synthesizing knowledge, interpreting evidence.

547
00:57:48,810 --> 00:57:56,010
Questions can be about interpreting or reading alone. It can be about connecting ideas in the paper that you read to the field more broadly.

548
00:57:56,010 --> 00:57:58,780
And like I said earlier, they can even be clarification questions.

549
00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:06,230
So if you didn't understand something like you can say so like there's no there are no wrong or bad students in this class.

550
00:58:06,230 --> 00:58:10,190
Here are examples of bad questions, something like what do you think of the WHL?

551
00:58:10,190 --> 00:58:16,670
That's not a good question. And I'll say this also applies like not just for classes where we come up with discussion questions as a class,

552
00:58:16,670 --> 00:58:20,660
but also for the perusal readings, write like another one.

553
00:58:20,660 --> 00:58:23,690
Was this paper methodologically sound like yes? No.

554
00:58:23,690 --> 00:58:30,740
Questions are also generally not the best system like discussion and then papers or sorry questions where you

555
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:35,030
could directly look up and read out of the reading unless it's kind of like more of a clarification question.

556
00:58:35,030 --> 00:58:40,520
Also not the best. Doesn't require critical thinking, but here are some examples of good questions.

557
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:43,880
Like what elements do you think might be missing from the UN's child's right?

558
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:50,090
Child rights based approach to improving child survival of the 10 elements of the global agenda identified by the reading,

559
00:58:50,090 --> 00:58:53,060
which do you feel should be the highest priority and why?

560
00:58:53,060 --> 00:59:00,170
How can the concept of Pandemic's be used to understand how the factors described in the article might interact to influence child?

561
00:59:00,170 --> 00:59:06,710
So these are just some examples. OK, time to move on to the lecture.

562
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:13,190
We've got about 20 minutes. What is global health?

563
00:59:13,190 --> 00:59:25,120
I'm asking this is a question. What is global?

564
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:32,630
I'll say this is not an easy question, but I ask myself this all the time, it's hard and I've let my feelings.

565
00:59:32,630 --> 00:59:37,500
Yes. And so this is kind of hard because after reading about paper,

566
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:43,470
mother saying how basically will become a global health, regular public health for other countries.

567
00:59:43,470 --> 00:59:51,950
It's like it's hard to grasp. Yeah. Could you address the difference between global health and international health?

568
00:59:51,950 --> 00:59:57,690
For sure. And I actually added a slide on that after looking at the personal comment.

569
00:59:57,690 --> 01:00:04,960
Yeah. So we'll get to that. Any other thoughts?

570
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:18,970
Yeah, maybe a little too involved figuring out how the world in a way to provide a

571
01:00:18,970 --> 01:00:30,370
decent quality of life for everyone and for a country that has a whole the world.

572
01:00:30,370 --> 01:00:36,940
Yeah, I think that's a great that's a great answer. That's in line with one of the definitions that we're going to go through.

573
01:00:36,940 --> 01:00:40,150
And that also makes me think someone commented like, how was it in Perusia?

574
01:00:40,150 --> 01:00:45,670
Like, how is it possible to improve quality of life or improve health outcomes for all people worldwide?

575
01:00:45,670 --> 01:00:50,560
Like is there actually like an example of like a practice where that has happened or is happening?

576
01:00:50,560 --> 01:01:03,500
Like it's so it's so huge. Right. And so if Global has to incorporate the whole world, that's just kind of like unmanageable in a way.

577
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:08,530
We just thought, yeah, yeah, I thought that actually,

578
01:01:08,530 --> 01:01:18,590
while working on that aspect of global health is like trying to keep ourselves from thinking when they should want this.

579
01:01:18,590 --> 01:01:24,330
And therefore, I'm going to make like I sound like a lot of people actually really love living without electricity,

580
01:01:24,330 --> 01:01:27,770
actually walking, going, oh, they need electricity and they need this.

581
01:01:27,770 --> 01:01:34,880
And it's like but they're happy with what their concerns are more about getting better access to like vaccines and medicine.

582
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:39,460
And we are very concerned about electricity. Yeah, I'm perfectly fine without it.

583
01:01:39,460 --> 01:01:44,600
Yeah. And selectees probably for ourselves about what is quality of life.

584
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:48,260
Is it according to different cultures. Yeah. Yeah. One hundred percent.

585
01:01:48,260 --> 01:01:54,050
That is like I wish I could kind of like print that out and save it so we can look at it because I think this is one

586
01:01:54,050 --> 01:02:00,350
really important thing for us all to do and to think about and the kind of really like ideas of decolonization as well.

587
01:02:00,350 --> 01:02:04,280
And so maybe we can talk about the international versus global health thing here.

588
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:09,800
And I think kind of like this is one issue where it's really important for us to

589
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:16,190
be very kind of self reflective of ourselves as researchers and as practitioners

590
01:02:16,190 --> 01:02:26,660
and where we come from and like how our assumptions and views about the world kind of articulate themselves in the work that we do and our intentions,

591
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:30,710
because nothing is kind of like nothing is like really neutral.

592
01:02:30,710 --> 01:02:38,180
Like the idea that people want electricity like that might be something that we just take for granted as people who are mostly from the US or from,

593
01:02:38,180 --> 01:02:43,100
like I said, the global north, but like the like forms of global health.

594
01:02:43,100 --> 01:02:53,810
And this is really international health is like where we go as people from like wealthy or upper income countries into lower or

595
01:02:53,810 --> 01:03:00,890
middle income countries and kind of impose our own kind of worldviews or assumptions about what health interventions are needed.

596
01:03:00,890 --> 01:03:06,710
And it's this very kind of like neo colonial approach to performing.

597
01:03:06,710 --> 01:03:13,850
I guess this is internation. This is kind of like the perspective of international health, which is like what the field of global health used to be.

598
01:03:13,850 --> 01:03:20,030
But it's sort of like evolving, I would say. So that is that is a really fantastic point to make.

599
01:03:20,030 --> 01:03:26,180
You. Any reactions to that?

600
01:03:26,180 --> 01:03:32,540
Well, it's very complex to give a definition of it is.

601
01:03:32,540 --> 01:03:45,840
We also have like the 17 goals of the United Nations education into global issues like health for all.

602
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:56,120
Everyone needs access to health and proper treatment.

603
01:03:56,120 --> 01:04:02,180
Yeah. So, yeah, I think it's challenging. I mean I mean, there are some things that like I do like.

604
01:04:02,180 --> 01:04:07,750
Having said that, I think there are some things that are kind of common that people want to be healthy and happy.

605
01:04:07,750 --> 01:04:13,580
You don't want to have a quality of life. Those things are just defined in different ways, in different places after that.

606
01:04:13,580 --> 01:04:19,760
But it also depends on the country's economic situation.

607
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:28,700
For example, in Europe, in Romania, you can be for the same quality of health care as the UK.

608
01:04:28,700 --> 01:04:35,120
So there are not I mean, there's not that evil.

609
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:41,780
Yeah. So essentially, like, we need to work within and with systems to provide the best that we can, I guess.

610
01:04:41,780 --> 01:04:48,920
Yeah. Yeah. In a different context. Any more thoughts before we move on to.

611
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:54,560
Yeah, sorry. Yeah, I want to talk about this. I this is good.

612
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:59,710
One thing is like little hope doesn't necessarily mean health directly.

613
01:04:59,710 --> 01:05:03,060
Like, I remember having a discussion with someone where we're living in an area with

614
01:05:03,060 --> 01:05:07,240
sewer roads for like hundreds and hundreds of miles and everything else.

615
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:12,320
Well, that's not the issue. We need to focus on other stuff. But roads may not seem like it's related.

616
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:16,700
But how do you get people things? They need good roads.

617
01:05:16,700 --> 01:05:21,830
And so also realizing that global health has so much more to do than just with health itself?

618
01:05:21,830 --> 01:05:33,350
Oh, absolutely. So, absolutely. Yeah. It's so it's so deeply tied to kind of like infrastructure economies, both locally and nationally as well.

619
01:05:33,350 --> 01:05:39,410
And I remember so I don't want to get too sidetracked, but I remember another kind of like road infrastructure related anecdote.

620
01:05:39,410 --> 01:05:45,890
So Joe Eisenberg, who is the chair of our department up until a few months ago, he does amazing work in Ecuador.

621
01:05:45,890 --> 01:05:54,170
And he they had been working on a project that was related to infrastructure improvement for improving health,

622
01:05:54,170 --> 01:05:59,570
and they were looking at the impacts of expanding roads in a rural region in Ecuador.

623
01:05:59,570 --> 01:06:04,340
And they found that actually rates of infectious disease went up once the roads were put in place

624
01:06:04,340 --> 01:06:09,000
because people were moving more and kind of like between communities and things like that.

625
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:15,200
And so it's not it's not that roads are nothing, roads are bad, but these things are really complicated.

626
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:20,690
And there's a lot of knock on effects. And things that we think of as being good aren't necessarily like a universal good.

627
01:06:20,690 --> 01:06:25,430
And so maybe we need to have plans in place for like to control infectious disease

628
01:06:25,430 --> 01:06:30,780
like that might arise when we do kind of economic interventions like roads like.

629
01:06:30,780 --> 01:06:35,720
And I think one of the things we learn in public health is like public. And I think we've learned this in the pandemic.

630
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:40,730
Right. Like public health shouldn't be siloed into public health, like everything is public health.

631
01:06:40,730 --> 01:06:45,620
You know, like, ah, like government safety nets, our social systems, our political systems,

632
01:06:45,620 --> 01:06:49,790
like everything we do in society, affects the health of people who live in it.

633
01:06:49,790 --> 01:06:58,970
Right. That's a great point. Yeah, I feel like I saw a hand here, but maybe not.

634
01:06:58,970 --> 01:07:06,110
OK, so the definitions that we have from some of the readings, an area for study,

635
01:07:06,110 --> 01:07:11,390
research and practice that places a priority on improving health and health equity for all people worldwide.

636
01:07:11,390 --> 01:07:18,650
So this is kind of like very similar to a definition of public health, but just kind of throws, in some words, about a global perspective on it.

637
01:07:18,650 --> 01:07:20,390
This is OK,

638
01:07:20,390 --> 01:07:26,900
health issues that transcend national boundaries and governments and call for actions on the global forces that determine the health of people.

639
01:07:26,900 --> 01:07:33,140
I kind of like this one. There's a lot of different health issues that transcend national boundaries.

640
01:07:33,140 --> 01:07:41,360
Right? Like covid, obviously. And this is why last year I just felt so frustrated by a lot of like very nationalistic approaches

641
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:46,550
to controlling covid with respect to things like border closures or accessing vaccines,

642
01:07:46,550 --> 01:07:50,240
because like we're not going to address likova doesn't care about boundaries.

643
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:57,380
Like we need interventions that go across like across many different countries because control,

644
01:07:57,380 --> 01:08:01,910
lack of control in one place is going to eventually spill over to other places.

645
01:08:01,910 --> 01:08:07,610
Another great example is climate change. Like a lot of the communities and populations that are most severely affected by climate

646
01:08:07,610 --> 01:08:14,240
change are not those same countries or states that are are the heaviest producers of carbon,

647
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:20,300
for example. And so like interventions to address climate change can't be global either.

648
01:08:20,300 --> 01:08:23,210
So I think this is a really nice definition.

649
01:08:23,210 --> 01:08:30,050
Collaborative transnational research and action for promoting health for all the collaborative transnational aspect.

650
01:08:30,050 --> 01:08:37,280
I think here is really important. This is kind of like that two way flow between wealthier countries and lower and middle income countries.

651
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:42,560
So it's not like people from high income countries parachuting in and doing some kind of intervention,

652
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:48,830
but people actually working together as equal partners in improving health of populations.

653
01:08:48,830 --> 01:08:52,400
And then I'm not going to read this one out. It's really long, honestly.

654
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:57,890
It's just kind of like a lot of words. This is nice. This is from the anthropology article, you know,

655
01:08:57,890 --> 01:09:04,130
and I think this actually recognizes a lot of the complexity around the issues that we deal with in global health.

656
01:09:04,130 --> 01:09:08,030
And these are the references, some critiques of the field.

657
01:09:08,030 --> 01:09:11,030
I think we've kind of actually touched on a lot of this as we've been talking.

658
01:09:11,030 --> 01:09:16,610
This is from that crane article on that Consortium for Universities and Global Health.

659
01:09:16,610 --> 01:09:19,340
So this idea that, like global health is a northern concept.

660
01:09:19,340 --> 01:09:26,490
So someone said it's this idea that like what we think of as global health is actually just simple straight up public health like in other countries.

661
01:09:26,490 --> 01:09:35,540
Right. So like for one thing that really touches like that got me in that article was when I think some of the attendees at that meeting said Dunwell,

662
01:09:35,540 --> 01:09:41,390
like we as someone from like a lower income country and I forget I forget exactly where the person was from.

663
01:09:41,390 --> 01:09:45,170
So like, how do our students and our residents practice global health?

664
01:09:45,170 --> 01:09:50,660
Are we going to send them to the north and then, like, work, you know, go do something in the US and then come back?

665
01:09:50,660 --> 01:09:56,900
And then also the idea of like so someone who is from, say, like South Africa for that person to practice global health,

666
01:09:56,900 --> 01:10:01,130
does that mean that they are geographically bound and have to stay there and cannot leave?

667
01:10:01,130 --> 01:10:05,690
And so there's a lot of complexity when we think about who who does global health,

668
01:10:05,690 --> 01:10:12,350
who performs global health and what is it when different people in different places are doing global health?

669
01:10:12,350 --> 01:10:14,420
And then again, it's more than international health,

670
01:10:14,420 --> 01:10:21,660
which is seen as kind of this unique directional flow rather than kind of a more equal bidirectional partnership,

671
01:10:21,660 --> 01:10:26,390
that I won't spend too much time on this if you didn't get a chance to look.

672
01:10:26,390 --> 01:10:28,730
So this is from one of the background readings.

673
01:10:28,730 --> 01:10:34,670
So you'll also notice for every class we have, kind of like more optional background recommended readings.

674
01:10:34,670 --> 01:10:36,500
If you don't have time to read them, that's fine.

675
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:42,200
But I definitely recommend reading them and they'll definitely add to your understanding and preparation for the class.

676
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:45,530
So this is from one of those. You can skim it.

677
01:10:45,530 --> 01:10:48,140
You don't need to read the whole paper. It's really long and complicated.

678
01:10:48,140 --> 01:10:55,520
But I did like this figure and it kind of showed this timeline of kind of like the origin and development of global health,

679
01:10:55,520 --> 01:11:03,380
which is kind of borne out of what was referred to as tropical medicine, which became international health and has now become global health.

680
01:11:03,380 --> 01:11:09,560
And it's kind of more moving towards this concept of even planetary health, which I don't know if it's really gaining traction or not.

681
01:11:09,560 --> 01:11:15,260
And it's kind of mapped on to kind of more kind of like social areas in the world of tropical medicine.

682
01:11:15,260 --> 01:11:20,120
Very much came up like the very colonial British era era of the Cold War.

683
01:11:20,120 --> 01:11:24,080
So kind of like mid 20th century, thinking about international health.

684
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:33,010
And now we're moving into global health in the era of globalization. And we'll talk more about this on Thursday.

685
01:11:33,010 --> 01:11:37,580
We call a bit of time. So, yeah, a comparison of global, international and public health.

686
01:11:37,580 --> 01:11:42,170
I kind of touched on this, but basically, like we refer to the field of global health.

687
01:11:42,170 --> 01:11:47,390
And this is why I don't like the name of the course as the health of nations international health,

688
01:11:47,390 --> 01:11:55,460
because I think that kind of drawing boundaries around nations like kind of ignores how a lot of these issues that we're talking about transcend,

689
01:11:55,460 --> 01:11:58,220
transcend national boundaries and are kind of really complex.

690
01:11:58,220 --> 01:12:07,520
In terms of how nation states interact, and we also have a lot of key actors and organizations in global health that are not nation states, right.

691
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:13,100
So in global health and I kind of like this, I guess, definition or statement,

692
01:12:13,100 --> 01:12:19,700
global health really focuses on issues that directly or indirectly affect health but can really transcend national boundaries.

693
01:12:19,700 --> 01:12:22,550
Whereas international health, like I said, is this really kind of udara?

694
01:12:22,550 --> 01:12:29,660
You need to focus on health of countries other than one's own and especially low income and middle income countries.

695
01:12:29,660 --> 01:12:32,240
And then public health, public health happens everywhere.

696
01:12:32,240 --> 01:12:36,840
This really focuses on issues that affect the health of a population of a particular community or country.

697
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:43,130
So we do so at the most basic and crude level as US researchers, we do public health in our own country.

698
01:12:43,130 --> 01:12:48,440
We do global health like when we collaborate and work with people from other countries.

699
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:53,900
And so, yeah, like I said, we can break down ways in which that's problematic as well.

700
01:12:53,900 --> 01:12:56,450
So this is kind of a nice I'm not going to read out this table,

701
01:12:56,450 --> 01:13:01,040
but this is kind of like a nice overview and kind of thinking about what it's global health,

702
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:05,060
what is international health and what is public health that comes from the Coplan paper.

703
01:13:05,060 --> 01:13:13,010
And this came out of that this paper by Koechlin. It came out of that consortium for Universities on Global Health meeting.

704
01:13:13,010 --> 01:13:16,490
So take that with a grain of salt if you want, I guess.

705
01:13:16,490 --> 01:13:23,770
And then finally, I just wanted to kind of give this kind of tongue in cheek overview on the difference between global health,

706
01:13:23,770 --> 01:13:32,590
tropical health and international health. This is from a blog written by Richard Smith, who is the editor of the BMJ.

707
01:13:32,590 --> 01:13:39,290
And he said Global Health 1.0 was called Tropical Medicine and was primarily concerned with keeping white men alive in the tropics.

708
01:13:39,290 --> 01:13:46,370
So very colonial like olden days stuff for it. Global Health 2.0 was called International Health and comprised clever people in rich

709
01:13:46,370 --> 01:13:50,990
countries doing something to help people in poor countries that have Cold War overtones.

710
01:13:50,990 --> 01:13:54,410
Global Health 2.0, which is still the main manifestation of global health,

711
01:13:54,410 --> 01:13:58,790
is about researchers from rich countries leading research programs in poor countries.

712
01:13:58,790 --> 01:14:05,480
So less of like an active and real partnership that is collaborative, but more like I'm going to go from a rich country.

713
01:14:05,480 --> 01:14:10,970
I'm going to go leave my program here to impose my views. Kind of what you were talking about, Global Health 4.0,

714
01:14:10,970 --> 01:14:18,500
increasingly the present and certainly the future is research and other activities being led by researchers from low and middle income countries.

715
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:24,080
So this is kind of very tongue in cheek, but kind of like a nice kind of overall framework for thinking about it.

716
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:28,250
But one really important caveat that I really want to make here that I really want to stress is

717
01:14:28,250 --> 01:14:33,590
that so we've kind of gone through all these critiques of global health and international health.

718
01:14:33,590 --> 01:14:42,530
And I think that can make it really difficult thinking about ourselves as global health researchers and practitioners in practice and in training.

719
01:14:42,530 --> 01:14:50,600
And what I want to say is I don't it's not necessarily problematic or wrong to be a person from the US

720
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:55,940
or another higher income country who is doing research and public health practice in other countries.

721
01:14:55,940 --> 01:15:02,780
Like inherently it is not wrong. But I think and I don't want us to kind of like, feel guilty or weird about that,

722
01:15:02,780 --> 01:15:10,640
but I do think that there are like I do think it is important to understand the history of the field and ways that

723
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:16,490
global and international health have been practiced in the past and still are being practiced that are problematic,

724
01:15:16,490 --> 01:15:21,170
that are potentially extractive and kind of like neocolonial and potentially not

725
01:15:21,170 --> 01:15:25,640
acting in the best interests of people that they are really meant to benefit.

726
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:31,490
But there is someone say something or maybe something,

727
01:15:31,490 --> 01:15:39,320
and there are ways to do this that are that are appropriate and are good and actually are kind of like truly collaborative and work with

728
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:48,140
community partners and that are culturally appropriate that do achieve the goals that we ultimately do want to achieve in global health.

729
01:15:48,140 --> 01:15:51,950
And that's something that we try to do in this class and throughout your impeaches

730
01:15:51,950 --> 01:15:56,600
to get you ready to be those people who are practicing global health in this way.

731
01:15:56,600 --> 01:16:01,730
So as I wrap up throughout the semester, we're going to critically interrogate the field of global health.

732
01:16:01,730 --> 01:16:05,240
We're going to learn about key state and non-state actors in the field.

733
01:16:05,240 --> 01:16:09,890
We're going to learn how to conduct secondary research and identify data sources in global health.

734
01:16:09,890 --> 01:16:14,630
You'll move on to learn about more direct field methods next semester and in your internship.

735
01:16:14,630 --> 01:16:19,790
And we're really just starting our journey to becoming a critical global health scholars and practitioners.

736
01:16:19,790 --> 01:16:28,230
So I really look forward to this semester with you and to like really getting into a lot of different issues in global health with you.

737
01:16:28,230 --> 01:16:31,910
So I hope you're also looking forward to it as well.

738
01:16:31,910 --> 01:16:35,390
And I'm just going to leave you with a few different student resources.

739
01:16:35,390 --> 01:16:41,780
We have a really great writing lab and you can book an appointment with them and they will read your papers and help you.

740
01:16:41,780 --> 01:16:49,400
And so they're really great. We have a student wellbeing and counseling psychology services, our caps, our caps, contact and speeches.

741
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:53,270
Megan Narula, you can email her directly. I know her. She's really, really nice.

742
01:16:53,270 --> 01:16:57,380
Or you can go to their website and request a consultation if you want to meet with them.

743
01:16:57,380 --> 01:17:05,340
We have a. Emergency fund for students are experiencing hardships, and we also have library tools that Gurpreet Ra has put together for the schools.

744
01:17:05,340 --> 01:17:10,510
And you can find all of this on campus as well. So that's all I have.

745
01:17:10,510 --> 01:17:15,520
Thank you all so much. Thank you for being kind of like my first in person class.

746
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:20,280
Like, I don't know how long it's been nice. We have a couple of minutes if anyone has any questions.

747
01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:30,431
Otherwise, I'll see you on Thursday.
