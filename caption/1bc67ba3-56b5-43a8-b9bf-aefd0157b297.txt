Here's a sample of a Yellowdig community feed, which is the landing page of your course community.

2
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:14,340
To create a post, click on the 'Create' button. You'll be prompted to tag your post with a topic created by your instructor.

3
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:23,160
You can enter text in the body of the post and format it in various ways, including inserting a block of code.

4
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:28,260
Use hashtags to call attention to key ideas in your post.

5
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:37,210
In addition to text, you can attach files, media and images, record short video and audio clips,

6
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:41,380
Insert emojis, create drawings,

7
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:48,360
include a poll, or write mathematical formulas.

8
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:57,090
When ready, you can submit your post for your peers to see and comment on.

9
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:01,230
Yellowdig will also save a draft of your post if you want to return to work on it later.

10
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:05,880
Use the 'Cancel' button and choose either save or discard.

11
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,280
Drafts can be viewed from the left hand panel.

12
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:18,410
This panel may collapse when using a smaller screen or mobile device and can be opened using the expand options.

13
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:32,010
To comment on a post, click the comment button. Similar to creating a post, you can format your text and include various types of content.

14
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:39,310
Each user can change the look of their feed using the filter and sort options.

15
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:48,660
If your community has been set up with point goals, you can track your progress and see how to earn points from the right hand panel.

16
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:54,210
If it's not visible, look for the expand arrow in the upper right corner.

17
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:01,640
