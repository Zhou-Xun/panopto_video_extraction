1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:14,090
I know. Isn't it interesting? Also, I. I that happens in so often tower.

2
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:19,010
So let's say.

3
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,980
So we already have the rules for all of us. So that I send an announcement.

4
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:31,340
So you can check the location for the office.

5
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:42,230
Also for my office. I am 138 and this is a little on the problem.

6
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:46,820
Then after class and on Friday it's a long session.

7
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:59,380
So I put the link on comma also to paste on the office, although usually it's a same location on a full day, so it's not to hold off in his office.

8
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:23,140
So that's up. And so this is only good today that this is this is because it has office all day and also 3 to 5, 30 to 45 hours.

9
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:28,120
But any questions? All right.

10
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:30,200
So let's start with you.

11
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:41,840
When we talk about last time, so on, so e file, since that is important, but we try to do what the user needs to know from the data.

12
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:50,600
So all the data we want to lot the population and specifically we want to know the parameter because the model is already assumed that for example,

13
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,839
if you have a normal distribution, you have a corollary distribution.

14
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:59,270
So tomorrow is a source and if you want to know, I know once we know that,

15
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:08,120
I know when you know that, you know for you and the first step in the meeting is people with that.

16
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:14,270
So what do we try to do is we try to come up with the summary of the data such

17
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:19,940
that we do not have to record all the data and once you know the summary.

18
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:27,230
So it's does give you the information about our parameter and that's all the data reduction.

19
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:31,700
So how we do how do we do this summary?

20
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:37,430
We achieve data reduction by defining a function of the data.

21
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:43,750
So what value is the P, the character? T This is a function of the data, so it's a function of the law.

22
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,380
Okay? So that is the realization of the statistic or it is a function of the sample.

23
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:56,870
And we've also achieved two goals. The first is that the summary is simpler than the original data.

24
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:04,070
The second, we want to keep all the information about C that is contained in the original data.

25
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:08,810
So we want it to be simpler and the are not moving information.

26
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:17,530
So this is the definition of statistic. So the definition of statistic is the very general it is aiming functions is

27
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:23,719
in function of the random variable and the because the act in the random acts

28
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:30,020
in the back to out of your sample so x one access if actually random the team

29
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:35,180
is also random and also you can describe as distributed using PMC or PDF.

30
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:44,090
So there are many, many statistics, some who have voiced, some are not so good.

31
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:55,070
And so we talk about how we provide the statistic as well as partitioning of the sample space.

32
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:59,420
So the sample space,

33
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:06,379
these are all possible realization of the things that make sense and it is the number

34
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:13,590
that you finally find after you put a sound element into one group in a subset.

35
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:23,840
Example, if you if you find the statistical information now after you grouped, you have potentially the original sample space into a full classes.

36
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:32,180
And here, for example, the three element, even though these are different, the realization of the run, the variable as a group into one class.

37
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:42,290
And if you only tell me that the statistic is one actually I do not know whether in 0000i do not know this element of the data.

38
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:59,510
But this is a good statistic. It is good enough. So and then we talk about what is a useful, a good statistic.

39
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:03,560
And the we said that you should have contained all the information.

40
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:11,580
You should not lose information and that. A statistic to achieve this goal because this official statistic to date.

41
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:20,550
It just means that a sufficient statistic is a statistic that keeps all the information about seed that is contained in the original sample.

42
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:25,410
How do we define this formulae using mathematics?

43
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,240
So the idea is. So. So.

44
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:35,010
I think some song concept should be clear.

45
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:40,260
So for this reason, a sample distribution of the original sample depend on all.

46
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:48,960
See, because the distribution of your original sample is a distribution is is the fact.

47
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:57,300
So this is your distribution and the distribution dependency. So this because a sample your data, the distribution of your data dependency.

48
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:03,230
Therefore, your data can give you information about system but can give you an idea about system.

49
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:08,520
And the second it used to be, you should know that if you have a good statistic,

50
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:13,770
then the statistic, the distribution of a statistic should also depend on singer.

51
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:22,410
For example, if you have X in the distribution, if the summation of X is the I know it is mission.

52
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:30,240
Yep. I know there is also a distribution dependency because the distribution of your statistic dependency.

53
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:36,270
Therefore, knowing the value of this statistic can give you information about c so.

54
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:42,050
Z. So. So first of all, you should also this should be clear. And then now the sufficient statistic means that.

55
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:48,380
So if you already know the value of your statistic, so give until x equals more t.

56
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:58,290
So if you know this information, then knowing the knowing that the entire sample and not give you information does not give you additional

57
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:06,270
information about this means the conditional distribution of s even here activities and the dependency.

58
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:12,330
Therefore the additional data and that provide you additional information about that.

59
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:15,450
So sometimes students are confused about this.

60
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:22,350
Sometimes people think that this official statistic, the distribution, that our dependency that is a that is not correct.

61
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:30,010
Actually, if you have a good statistic, if you have a sufficient statistic, the distribution must depend on that.

62
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:38,490
Otherwise, you cannot give information positive. So the statistic I give you information about data, but knowing this value of the statistic,

63
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:43,050
then the data itself does not provide you additional information about Z.

64
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:50,370
So this infusion of statistic, the definition is that if you have a statistic and the conditional distribution of X,

65
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:56,130
even the value of the statistic and not dependency, then it is this information, this statistic.

66
00:07:56,430 --> 00:08:02,760
So it's very important to understand intuitively how to interpret that definition.

67
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:10,020
And so we use this definition to check that the sum basically the sufficient statistic.

68
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:17,730
So this, I think, is very important to understand the the here,

69
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:23,490
because once you understand this proof, then you will be you will understand that next to you.

70
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:31,620
So when we did this, when we put a summation of distribution in a sufficient statistic, we directly use the definition.

71
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:39,330
So what we need to do is to derive the conditional distribution of the sample given P of extract and then

72
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:46,230
just use what we learned 601 to derive this distribution and now to derive the condition distribution.

73
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:57,840
So the conditional distribution is the probability of the this event divided by the probability of the event of exact equal to.

74
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:02,490
And then we need to discuss two possibilities. So the first possibility is that.

75
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:08,040
So it is possible that you x, y, your x are equal to all x odds.

76
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:13,319
But the summation of underestimation even to the T and this is the possible.

77
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:17,820
You bet. When this happens, you have this probability. That is the conditional probability.

78
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:25,320
And so by. So for example here. So it could be so your t equal to zero.

79
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:29,640
And then you are your X in 000.

80
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:37,130
So they are right. As it could also be that this is zero through your x is your view of R and then you do that.

81
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:46,640
So simple is complicated. It's not possible that x above and had zero zero by some ato x is equal to zero.

82
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:52,470
It's not possible in that situation. So the condition of distribution is you says are true scenarios.

83
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:57,510
So we discussed this two scenarios and then we check that regardless.

84
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:05,760
So at the end, we will see that if in the second scenario that is zero zero, then our dependency is in the first case, then the condition.

85
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:10,970
Our distribution in this number. This number, the no see the no p here.

86
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:14,870
So therefore of according to the definition, the P of X.

87
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:19,590
So the text of the estimation of X is a sufficient statistic for people.

88
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:25,940
So it is very important to understand the proof because this is a more concrete example.

89
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:30,110
And in the next theorem basically to summarize, the result is more abstract.

90
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:33,410
Because of these entities we should not expect only distribution.

91
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:50,130
So. So now if we summarize from this pool, we know that if X is a sample point, so the X in full.

92
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:54,760
So this is so this means x, y or x. So this is a realization, right?

93
00:10:54,780 --> 00:11:00,930
So this is a sample in x in a sample point, a subset of x that not equal to a T,

94
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:05,970
then we know that's the condition of probability and equal to zero and a therefore is not a function of C.

95
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:12,260
So these are always a whole. So this doesn't mean that we don't have to consider this scenario any more because we know it's zero.

96
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:18,480
They're not dependency. So, so, so in the future, we don't have to consider this case.

97
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:26,940
And if we summarize the message and there is because this you in the series that so now we have a so in

98
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:33,540
addition to the definition you can use this theorem to check whether a statistic is sufficient or not.

99
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:39,520
So what do we do? Is it so? First of all, you need to know that your distribution of your right.

100
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:47,520
So once you have your data, you will assume a model and you need to know that your distribution of your sample and also if you define the statistic,

101
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:55,470
as I said, the statistic is a function of a random sample now for yourself and also random for any random variable.

102
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:58,940
It has a distribution space as a PDF of PMS.

103
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:09,570
So that's V, you use Q to denote the pdf Lippmann of this T and they want to check whether he is sufficient or not.

104
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:13,890
Then we just need to check the ratio in a wrote in this ratio.

105
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:23,130
The numerator is a joint distribution of your sample divided at a specific point in the denominator.

106
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:34,320
It is it is the distribution of your key by dividing this heo small x and if this ratio is constant as a function of see how,

107
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,920
then it is a sufficient statistic.

108
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:43,810
And if it if you look at this ratio more closely, you see that it's just this one, right?

109
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:53,160
So it is just the full scenario here and the economics that means the next so so we want to for this zero

110
00:12:53,550 --> 00:13:01,500
and basically you see that the proof is parallel to the C for the proof we have for the photo we the look.

111
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:14,430
So let's look at this theorem. So at this point, we only have one pool, two pool, two pool sufficiency of that in the definition.

112
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:24,150
So you overuse a definition. You need to evaluate the condition or distribution of your sample or even the value of the statistic.

113
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:29,490
So let's look at this probability. And this probability is a ratio, right?

114
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:34,920
So in the numerator and in the probability of the first event.

115
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:44,700
So the profile of this event and the second event up to events of before we said this is probably A and B.

116
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:56,410
And in the denominator, the suggestion of quality is healthy.

117
00:13:57,010 --> 00:14:02,140
But again, when we look at the pools, so we say that.

118
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:11,860
So there are actually two scenarios. So one scenario is that the heel X is equal to the small.

119
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:18,410
And a lot of guys in the Team X are not even a small team, so the team cannot use a small Q.

120
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:22,510
So we know this little problem in zero is not possible left here.

121
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:26,690
So you'll go X and [INAUDIBLE] be equal to you. So these probabilities you.

122
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:34,430
And if it if it is a close case, then these probabilities,

123
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:48,470
the probability of A and B and a B say it is just the probability that B explains why this it is the case that that is in the case because.

124
00:14:50,640 --> 00:15:03,060
A in a subset of people because about because of a piece of x equal to achieve x equal to x pro x must be equal to peak.

125
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:12,970
But so therefore the probability of A and in section B is yes, the probability of any question.

126
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:18,060
Yes. You know, sometimes even if people have used bodies.

127
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:23,850
So if I write this for me, I just means it. So the x equals a small x.

128
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:29,970
So this event actually is a subset of this event.

129
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:34,710
Let's think about this for minute by minute in the case.

130
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:41,530
So there's a lot that they just means the eggs.

131
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:48,550
So this is the old political point. And if you don't understand this, just some of these examples.

132
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:53,820
So, for example, if you go to the previous example, so it's a well-known example.

133
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:59,170
So basically this means that. So it's like, let me hear how zero, zero.

134
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:02,710
Wow. So this is a particular class.

135
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:09,350
This is a particular realization. And now you see that my what is Mickey of X here?

136
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:12,400
X is equal to what pr x equals.

137
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:21,660
Now, what is the matter? What is that event to be? Event B means that T of X has to be equal to about.

138
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:33,420
If you ask people to lie, then there actually is real possibility that violates the 001010100.

139
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:38,580
Right. So now you can see that event x is a subset that you to be at.

140
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:42,280
So yeah, so this actually is a key in this proof.

141
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:47,530
Once you understand that event, it is a subset of event B, then you will understand this pattern.

142
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:51,129
So, so if you are confused.

143
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:54,820
So think about the example I have last time.

144
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:59,830
So now. So. So the probability of x equals more x.

145
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:08,710
It doesn't pmf. And in the denominator, the probability of x equals is the more t is just the PMF of this t.

146
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:12,280
You've added this to x. And so now.

147
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:19,600
So so important to the assumptions. So sometimes as this ratio is a constant as a function.

148
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:26,680
So these ratios are not depend on sigma now for this whole thing are not depend on theta.

149
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:32,740
And therefore by definition here x is a sufficient cities if you.

150
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:47,350
So the profiler set is exactly parallel to the and the proof is already in the.

151
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:52,110
So I was found zero useful.

152
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:58,930
So. So it's actually basically that definition just a little bit simpler.

153
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:02,160
You don't have to discuss the two situations.

154
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:05,280
So, so from the cognition discussion,

155
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:12,690
we all had to accept the case of X equals p and of an x and not because has to make a statement on the latter case.

156
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:20,070
As I just know is it simplifies it so you don't have to to do that essentially on the same.

157
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:25,410
So this is out of the 0.6 to 2.

158
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:30,690
So so far, you have learned two tools for proving sufficiency.

159
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:35,670
The first part is the definition, and the second about body is is sans urine.

160
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:55,920
And now we look at this example previously, previously, and we proved that that is an examination is sufficient of statistical wisdom.

161
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:04,950
So now still the same example. This time we will actually use the new theorem we just learned.

162
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:16,090
Let's roll this together. So if I want to use a theorem so I need to calculate the ratios in the numerator.

163
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:21,050
It is that your distribution of your sample in the denominator as in the distribution

164
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:30,170
of p divided in a12x o that your distribution the X of the I.D. baloney distribution.

165
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:35,930
So the your distribution in the product of the quarter distribution.

166
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:46,270
So they see the distribution for X want and time distribution for X two and up to the distribution of X.

167
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:50,750
This is a product. Now it is by like tons.

168
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:57,250
So P to the x1p time Peter Paul X to X-Men.

169
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:09,200
So this will give me a p the power of summation x and then I have to with phase one minus P,

170
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:18,860
so y minus p, 12, 12, minus x one minus P to a possible minus x two and the one minus P to a minus x.

171
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:33,469
So if I collect and combine them while minus P to a, minus x, and so now I have a numerator, I need to book the denominator of the denominator.

172
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:37,190
I need to know the statistics.

173
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:49,640
Now this statistic is a team X that is, I make x and we know that some x so I makes our independent but only distribution to give you.

174
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:53,540
If I know my distribution, be the prime analogy. Right.

175
00:20:54,290 --> 00:21:06,640
So now you can write down the PMC for this t acuity key is this polluted, this binomial distribution and your value to the ratio.

176
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:13,040
Now so this is the distribution divided it as multi.

177
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:22,310
So this is some old heat and then you look at the ratio you need to evaluate the distribution of T and this T of a small x.

178
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:29,960
So this is x, they should be the same. This is the only thing you need to pay attention to this point.

179
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:33,800
So now we see that our main times can be canceled.

180
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:44,540
So here are how key part of Salvation X here, how p trump calls on me to be canceled and also this to cancel this term.

181
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:58,610
And I left with this ratio and this ratio does not depend on t now for using 02622,

182
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:05,030
I can conclude that a summation of X is a sufficient statistic for P.

183
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:14,250
It's anonymous and a lot.

184
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,740
Okay. So let's not just look at another example.

185
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:28,990
So in this example, I assume that my data in a normal distribution would be the prime time you and a sigma script.

186
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:37,700
But to make them simpler. So I would assume that the Sigma Square is a no, that the no constant example of Sigma must be a can be equal to one.

187
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:43,360
True. So if this is already known to you, then this is a constant is no longer a prime.

188
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:48,210
So if it is a parameter, your lot is Euclidean space.

189
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:54,310
You do not know this massive given right here. So that is no one needs a constant, so it's no longer a parameter.

190
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:58,050
So in this case, actually my prime to be the mean. So see, the.

191
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:02,200
It has to be. So you a one dimensional parameter.

192
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:06,250
So now. So for normal distribution.

193
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:15,400
So if you want to know what is the mean so intuitively, you would know that the average actually can give you some information about me.

194
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:24,430
So you see, the average seems to be a good summary of the data in terms of the mean of the distribution.

195
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:34,350
So intuitively, this is the case. And now we just want to check for money whether the average is a sufficient statistic for me.

196
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:44,500
So so we have to use the definition and this file the zero six to a tool that we are going to use on this unit 6 to 2,

197
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:49,840
because it is a little bit simple. So first of all, you need to know the distribution of your sample.

198
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:56,100
So, so because the data is the first of all, you need to know the marginal distribution of single sample.

199
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:59,770
So. So for normal distribution, this is the PDF.

200
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:06,380
And now so this is our strategy, right?

201
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:13,600
So we are trying to look at the ratio so we can see that you need to know that your distribution of your entire company.

202
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:20,780
So sometimes we make a mistake here because of a C homework and exam.

203
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:25,480
Some students, they use the distribution of a single innovation.

204
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:32,170
That is not correct. Here you see the numerator is actually should it be that you own this mission of your entire sum?

205
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:40,420
So you need to know that Jonah's read your entire sample. And also, we need to know the distribution of the source of his.

206
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:46,680
And so this is something we need to Iraq.

207
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:55,400
One of the things which I will admit you'll remember the result if you add in far smaller solutions, but it is really the average.

208
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:01,690
You still know this region, right?

209
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:08,280
You know how to pick up something on a device, that combination of independent laws and still normal.

210
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:14,510
You need to know that the PDF and all they need to know the problem.

211
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:31,249
And and then we just need to simplify the ratio such that it's good not it does not depend on prime time so let's do this so so in six.

212
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:39,319
So that's actually already a load that if. So how can I remember the results?

213
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:48,460
So because I know the meaning of x, I must be equal to the mean of x, but so is an equal to me.

214
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:52,150
So that's how I remember the meaning of the last decision.

215
00:25:52,300 --> 00:26:02,320
And the variance of the X is equal to all the variance of x over that.

216
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:09,500
So this is equal to Sigma Square. So now from here, you know, the X bar must be a normal resolution.

217
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:17,620
These mean views. And if you are a Sigma Square alliance and also the joint distribution.

218
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:23,500
So the joint people are inside. So John is mutually just a product of this model distribution.

219
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:33,230
And now we just so already know the denominator.

220
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:39,469
So I see now the denominator is involved x bar and it involves me and this is in my

221
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:44,450
numerator and you take the ratio and they're shown as the ratio does not depend on me.

222
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:49,130
It is okay, the ratio depend on sequence to apply that.

223
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:54,019
So you can even know that sigma is good because sigma space, that's a constant.

224
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:57,320
You can view the sequence, go out the bar and there is a constant that doesn't matter.

225
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:03,200
So it is the okay, the ratio depend, sigma is good. You all need to show that the ratio does not depend on me.

226
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,370
So some function against read on the middle here. Right.

227
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:15,370
So this is like if I had in the numerator, if this are how I can come up with a tool that in exactly the same as these, these can be cancel it.

228
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:28,490
So that is what I'm trying to do. So I look so here I have the numerator and so here I have to high sigma square.

229
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:33,410
So we are all so so this so so this one here.

230
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:44,930
So this will give me two Sigma Square 12 of now to us electric and then the second one here are five exponential and I pull this out major here

231
00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:57,770
summations I for one so this is R so you see that my goal here is I try to come up with the total size that is related to export minus this great.

232
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:02,250
But here I have x bar x minus me.

233
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:06,810
So this is a trick we use also for distribution.

234
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:16,980
I'm sure you have seen this before. So what I did is he had an extra minus MMU, minus X and plus X files to make sure it did not change anything.

235
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:26,130
And then I had these. Well, now I view these as a first for this as a sex talk.

236
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:29,430
I expand on that as well, Tom.

237
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:36,630
So let's do that. So here.

238
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:53,010
I have some Matia. X I minus x bar plus x minus new cigaret.

239
00:28:53,060 --> 00:29:07,270
Right? So I have two terms. So this would give me x minus x squared plus x minus new square plus two times x.

240
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:11,260
Minus X four times x minus.

241
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:15,040
That's. Annika here.

242
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:20,230
You see that? I have a summation. Summation I provide to that so I can put us on major here.

243
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:33,130
So I know I want to end this made. I need to add a submission here at a summation here and a poodle summation here and now.

244
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:37,390
So this Tom here, what is this Tom here?

245
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:49,750
So you see that this term is equal to so this is summation I for one for the X but I know I know that the mute and I depend on.

246
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:54,729
So this means that X an IMU that constant I can move this outside the submission.

247
00:29:54,730 --> 00:30:03,100
So these are two times x minus mu summation x minus x.

248
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:11,130
But what is this? What is this number? So this is a major X minus.

249
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:13,800
And times expire.

250
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:29,180
So this evening, as you can see, let's set because this is summertime exile minus summation of the ex-boss Democrats by just how much of an exception.

251
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:35,180
So this is zero. So you see that as his end now on in a laugh with these two tone.

252
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:48,570
So that is the tone here. So how summation X minus X squared plus times X minus means which you got here.

253
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:52,050
The x part, I mean not depend on x summation.

254
00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:56,580
I for one just in times x minus two.

255
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:05,720
Okay. And I still need to keep the denominator to sing.

256
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:10,140
Must be. So now.

257
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:18,530
So now I put posting together. So this is the numerator and if you look at the ratio and then the numerator.

258
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:23,870
So this is the numerator. So, so now I see that some plans can be canceled.

259
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:28,650
So, so I have this term here.

260
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:34,210
I have to have this term here.

261
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:38,760
Right. So is that exactly the same as is to cancel this term.

262
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:42,660
So here I have some constant that.

263
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:49,410
So you have said constant and here this is what left me for the exponential function.

264
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:54,600
And here you see that it depends on Sigma Square.

265
00:31:54,690 --> 00:32:01,170
As I said, it does not matter because only once you are in the constant and you see the reason are not depend on that.

266
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:14,730
Now also according to zero 6 to 2 so the sample mean so the average the sample mean is a sufficient statistic for me.

267
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:25,350
So if I. So let's review this.

268
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:36,419
So too. So, first of all, you know that intellectually you know that's the sample mean actually in a good subject for the for the being of the

269
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:43,170
population because you know that they can give you an idea like in the media that if the average you live you think

270
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:50,999
in the mean lot plan the average volume I think the mean is mock so yeah so this is our intuition and indeed we

271
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:56,930
show that it is a sufficient statistical for me and to show it in a sufficient statistical and even evaluate the,

272
00:32:56,930 --> 00:33:00,430
the ratio and your together ratio, you need you to have that your,

273
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:07,920
the institution of your entire data and the distribution of your statistics, so forth.

274
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:12,180
I figured out the distribution of the statistic. No,

275
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:18,090
you didn't knowledge of the lab then I guess that your distribution now look the ratio and if I

276
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:26,490
use well I look at the ratio I know that I try to get rid of I try to get rid of this term here.

277
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:36,310
Right. So, so what I did is here in this world of a minus X plus x and then to show that this class product is

278
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:42,600
zero and I only have these two terms and then cancel this term and show it in a sufficient statistic.

279
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:47,460
The so is this this trick is true we use very often.

280
00:33:47,760 --> 00:34:02,400
So because we don't. So today we're going to know a new tool to show you the species.

281
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:08,310
So we see that in the tool we have known so far.

282
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:14,430
What we have to show something is the fusion of first you need to have a proposal.

283
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:18,270
So you're proposing another one. So this is my this is a meme.

284
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:27,390
This is the summation. So for that, you have to propose a statistic and then to check whether it is the fusion of that is not that useful.

285
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:32,560
Because if I have a distribution, I would no idea what it would be as a fusion of statistic.

286
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:36,090
And you have to come up with many, many proposals. Use the definition to check.

287
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:47,340
That's not convenient. So in a factory theorem, so this is a very useful theorem, is probably the most useful theory in this chapter.

288
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:52,620
So this year actually can help you to find a sufficient statistic.

289
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:58,500
So. So what we do in the first, we need to know the job description of the sample.

290
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:03,580
Here are the highlights in the joint because due to the always comparing one,

291
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:07,970
this is a joint distribution of the entire sample, not a marginal distribution of X.

292
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:18,630
So that is, I guess, a joint distribution. And then we look at your distribution and who are and so we saw this in a joint distribution and

293
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:26,820
we try to see whether we can start to the joint is fusion to prove hard to improve our functions.

294
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:32,879
So if this can be factored into a function that the panel exponent so you see

295
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:38,940
here this function only dependent X and now dependency on in another function.

296
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:47,460
So these functions depend on see them and depend on exit, but it depend on X through a function of x.

297
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:54,500
So if you have a wide major distribution in this way and then the key of X in a sufficient.

298
00:35:56,290 --> 00:36:01,120
So they are a fact wait and see what is actually true.

299
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:06,700
So in this year ahead, two directions. The FAA says if you already have a sufficient statistic.

300
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:12,100
So suppose in the previous example, we already have you already have a statistic.

301
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:16,300
So if key is sufficient, then you can always find a function.

302
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:22,920
And then finally, that's one of eight such that a job description can be factored into this Tool Time.

303
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:29,170
So they're not allowed to say that if you can't factor your transmission in this way,

304
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:40,990
and then adherence must be a sufficient statistic and was actually the most important a direction is in the unions is to find a sufficient statistic.

305
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:47,780
So. So this g this g can be any function.

306
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:56,410
Plus this must be a function of zero. And the function function of is to x and the H2 x having any function even be a constant.

307
00:36:56,830 --> 00:37:03,880
So that can be equal. So, so, so to use this zero.

308
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:16,659
So first we need to you, we need to write down the job v for your entire sample and then try to see whether I can factor that factor.

309
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:26,590
This judge is an integral part in G and H, and if we do this, then we find us efficient, statistically successful.

310
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:34,329
So now successful, linear, first to the zero and then we are going to show you how to do this.

311
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:40,830
You have to find a sufficient statistic. So I said this zero had two directions.

312
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:47,910
So to me is when we want to prove the zero have to prove two directions, so they will prove it.

313
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,410
First, we will prove that only if so,

314
00:37:50,420 --> 00:38:01,270
this direction says if X is a sufficient statistic and then you will be able to factor you are your distribution into this whole part.

315
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:09,490
So first, I suppose P of act is a sufficient statistic and then I want to show that a job

316
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:15,340
distribution indeed can be fact rise into can be factored into that to package.

317
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:28,389
So so this is a joint decision. So I will try to see whether I can write a joint distribution into two functions and a joint distribution here.

318
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:35,560
I'm assuming the X is discrete, a sample continuous on this measure the idea is exactly the same.

319
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:39,620
You just need to use a pdf instead of pmpm.

320
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:43,420
So here I'm using the discrete distribution as an example.

321
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:48,220
So this is the PMS for eggs and for PMS.

322
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:52,720
So this are just a probability of your x equal to this small that.

323
00:38:53,920 --> 00:39:04,570
And now what I'm trying to say is the probability of x equals a small x and [INAUDIBLE] get equal to kill x by the season.

324
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:10,100
Madam. So he left.

325
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:21,290
So if I want to say that the probability of, say, x equals 4001.

326
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:38,270
So this is the original statement. And then the second statement says This is the probability of X equal to 001 and the summation of x equal to what?

327
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:43,890
So you see that if the eggs in equal to 001,

328
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:52,260
then the formation of x must mean that this is actually the second statement is a redundant statement about it.

329
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:58,170
And it is correct because if the first event happens, the same event must happen.

330
00:39:58,470 --> 00:40:06,880
So that that is about resistance in at least two probability at the same time.

331
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:14,250
So now have event A and event B, so as causes this.

332
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:19,750
So this is the probability of event A and B and then six.

333
00:40:19,830 --> 00:40:24,370
So Y, so you know that this is a second.

334
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:39,900
And so this is equal to the probability of this is probability of B times, the probability of a given right.

335
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:48,450
So this would tend to do so, so, so and so this is the probability of B, right?

336
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:53,700
This is probably hoping this is a power video, a given.

337
00:40:56,130 --> 00:41:02,550
So now so this whole idea can change a still from the probability of here this is the probability.

338
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:12,540
So this is the probability of now here the second time here the probability to a given B originally.

339
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:15,360
So if I did not have any information,

340
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:22,049
you want me to assume that this probability dependency because the original distribution at dependency now for analyst

341
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:32,280
statement in the probability may depend on that and now why I hear a draw for this idea here I am going to draw this here here.

342
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:39,990
So you see these statements that depend on see them and now drop and see what why this is why I can write this.

343
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:48,480
Not without her used. So this is because it's a business, right?

344
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:58,600
So this because he acts is sufficient that you can't protect him.

345
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:03,470
I assumed he of x is a sufficient statistic right here.

346
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:09,880
I assume that he acts in a sufficient statistic. Now fall back definition of a sufficient statistic.

347
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:16,930
This condition definition does not depend on the. That's why I can you that back you so.

348
00:42:17,050 --> 00:42:22,780
So now this pardon our dependency. So now you can see that I can call the.

349
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:26,590
The first function I need.

350
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:30,310
He said. Because the force function. Dependency.

351
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:37,090
And also depend on this type of X. So this is a function dependency that and also dependent on exit.

352
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:44,020
So I can call this IGT system and in a second the function is i.e. the second only dependent exit.

353
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:55,540
So call the second the function h of exit. If I do this, if I defined the GTC that defined h x, then the job distribution is.

354
00:42:57,390 --> 00:43:02,070
Factors into the product of this turn have this set.

355
00:43:02,490 --> 00:43:06,360
So a pool with a pool that the owner is paid.

356
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:12,120
So if I have a has the physique, you can always find a factory of your distribution.

357
00:43:16,410 --> 00:43:23,069
So you feel so this is the only if and no harm to us.

358
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:30,960
Actually, the most important part is the other direction that you have a separation, that you will be able to find a sufficient statistic.

359
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:34,320
So this part is more useful to us.

360
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:38,850
So let's look at this direction. So.

361
00:43:39,510 --> 00:43:45,830
So here we assume that the facts were to exist. So the fact we can this.

362
00:43:47,130 --> 00:43:50,340
So in the t here in my true here,

363
00:43:50,340 --> 00:44:01,650
the g kind of any function of Siva and t of X is kind of any function that attacks any form of x and even be a trivial function of a constant.

364
00:44:03,330 --> 00:44:13,590
Now, here, in my proof here, it just happens that the Jyoti is the discrete empty that so you have to in this prove it does happen that I

365
00:44:13,590 --> 00:44:21,540
can show you this got to be the distribution of t to be the pimp of this t but you must second the proof here.

366
00:44:22,770 --> 00:44:29,160
I only as soon as the factory to exist this q function may or may not be the is futile.

367
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:34,920
So here you just it doesn't function that the functionality the ante of x.

368
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:40,530
So here I didn't assume it is a pdf or pamphlet of what.

369
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:44,070
So that is that is not assumed here. So only I.

370
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:48,300
So this situation exist. So now.

371
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:53,120
So it's not. So because here he is a function, right?

372
00:44:53,130 --> 00:44:57,180
So this T of x is a statistic for any statistic that is a distribution.

373
00:44:57,450 --> 00:45:06,810
So as soon as the math of this he is quoted in the Q may not be equal, which is may so is may or may not.

374
00:45:07,290 --> 00:45:13,050
So so this actually is a notation we talked about before.

375
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:17,580
So respond. So remember, we talk about the origin original sample space.

376
00:45:17,910 --> 00:45:22,920
Now, once you define the statistic after you partition of the sample space into many subsets.

377
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:30,360
So let's review this notation because they're going to use it. He.

378
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:32,920
Right. So this is the original sample space.

379
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:41,850
And there's an all possible realization once that you find a statistic depending on the and depend dependent on the value of the statistics.

380
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:48,090
So you could be zero one or two or three partitioned the sample space into different classes of class.

381
00:45:48,490 --> 00:45:59,020
And I did notice that as a subtype. So this could A0 is got a subclass the Y you just batting over the P is A's up to use A's.

382
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:06,010
Otherwise that could be many, many elements. So this is a notation I'm using, so I'll go back here.

383
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:25,570
So here. So I. So this is just another. And he identified some entity in a subset in the original sample space.

384
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:31,980
And it had all the elements of why such that the TLR is just equal to this not feasible.

385
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:35,650
I have a zero. They want a to a three.

386
00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:39,550
So now let's look at this. Cute.

387
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:43,690
The q t is apmf0tx.

388
00:46:43,690 --> 00:46:54,590
But under this definition, the PMF it does the probability of kiosks equal to smoking and up is six over.

389
00:46:54,640 --> 00:47:02,350
You know, the law of total probability. So the probability if, for example, the probability of an X equal to Y,

390
00:47:02,530 --> 00:47:11,800
just summation of all the possibility it is the probability of a00, by contrast, and probably 201058500.

391
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:19,750
So it is a probability of all the an element in a he is a low probability in six of us.

392
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:27,429
And now I look at the ratio because what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to show that

393
00:47:27,430 --> 00:47:31,540
if the pathway to exist and [INAUDIBLE] have X must be a sufficient statistic.

394
00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:37,050
And to show sufficiency, I want to use semen preservation.

395
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:40,929
So I'm using this theory. So. So in.

396
00:47:40,930 --> 00:47:45,219
And you're right, huh? So these are your description of X and and so on is a factor.

397
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:54,130
I tell you this, so that your suspicion can be used in as the g time speech and that means the denominator.

398
00:47:54,460 --> 00:48:03,240
So this is just a PML with T for this T and the and I just said that's the plan focus.

399
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:08,920
He can move to Z Square. So I just plug in this into the formula here.

400
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:12,480
Now, this is the proof of this in the PMF.

401
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:16,180
This t u value is in NATO with small axes.

402
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:32,950
So which means that I should find all the y such that these in this last set a sort of x and then so now let's say that George is speaking of x.

403
00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:39,400
So Jonathan, to your accent, like I use the France weighting, I get the facts rated by fractionation.

404
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:43,210
So this Georgia. Do you think Cameroon has a product? Well, these and these.

405
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:51,459
And then so you're going to see that here I have H1 the right for me and in Y I'm

406
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:55,390
innocent in this offset these are but you can mess up setting the subclass so

407
00:48:55,390 --> 00:49:01,990
if I can be 000101 when any minutes I cannot move this outside of the summation

408
00:49:02,530 --> 00:49:09,610
and look at this part what about this part on the Y can be different element.

409
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:20,390
What about Cohiba? Because they are all within a subset, said Face X, which means that the people actually do not change.

410
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:25,630
Even the Y changes track are motivated by most all the equality of x factor agree.

411
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:41,080
So for example here. So if my suppose my x is zero zero plan and he of x accident equal to my right.

412
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:45,590
So if a sub t is actually including three element.

413
00:49:52,270 --> 00:49:52,520
Right.

414
00:49:52,720 --> 00:50:09,400
So, so so this means that within the subset a line actually that he by four or so, within a while for Y using a y absentee a y is always a equal tool.

415
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:14,470
Wow. Right. So which means. So these this does not depend on one.

416
00:50:14,890 --> 00:50:20,470
So. So I can move this outside of this operation, at least for outside of this one.

417
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:30,300
So now so you see that this town council, this town has a this town.

418
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:35,700
And then with that map is this region. And this really should no longer be paid.

419
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:43,530
And therefore, you there's zero six food for it is a sufficient statistic.

420
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:51,900
I'm going to take a break here. So you come back at four and I'm going to explain this offering.

421
00:51:04,032 --> 00:51:07,072
Let's come back to past.

422
00:51:09,852 --> 00:51:21,372
So we just learned the February confusion. So as you wrote, this has had some said if you have sufficiency now, you will be able to find a factory.

423
00:51:22,062 --> 00:51:28,212
So here we see that in the first place. So we prove that you can explain a sufficient statistic.

424
00:51:28,482 --> 00:51:33,162
Then we will be able to find. In fact, recent operations may not be unique.

425
00:51:33,672 --> 00:51:39,012
Actually, there are many ways to satirize the Chinese vision.

426
00:51:39,672 --> 00:51:43,182
But as long as this is, at least you will find the wow factor.

427
00:51:43,422 --> 00:51:50,742
So that is what they did. So when he does the visa statistic, I find that Father H and the father factory.

428
00:51:51,172 --> 00:51:56,112
And this is how I reported this. But in another direction here.

429
00:51:56,112 --> 00:52:02,681
What I'm trying to show is if you have a fluctuation because mean if the job distribution

430
00:52:02,682 --> 00:52:10,282
can be it is the T an eight is already a given function in all these factories implement.

431
00:52:11,202 --> 00:52:20,832
And then you want to show that if the job description can be factored into this two part, the heel has to be sufficient.

432
00:52:21,402 --> 00:52:26,802
Now, how did you feel? Sufficiency. So we used zero six to talk to show sufficiency.

433
00:52:27,222 --> 00:52:37,002
Now how do we use the zero? So what we need to do is we need to evaluate the ratio of the ratio, and then we look at this ratio.

434
00:52:37,322 --> 00:52:41,322
And you're right, huh? So because as soon as this property existed.

435
00:52:41,592 --> 00:52:44,982
So I replaced the job description. I used punctuation.

436
00:52:45,192 --> 00:52:47,862
So this is what I did on a in the denominator.

437
00:52:48,042 --> 00:52:56,192
So here in the denominator is the job is a description of he evaluating added he could heal X but so this.

438
00:52:56,212 --> 00:52:59,742
So now I need to write down the distribution of these images.

439
00:52:59,752 --> 00:53:05,622
What does the probability of x equals? What's the market? The use in the law of total probability?

440
00:53:05,832 --> 00:53:16,622
So I know that the probability of x equal to the number, the probability of people what it does, the probability of this event added together.

441
00:53:17,382 --> 00:53:24,822
So there's that. So y is an index. So Y it could be 001010 provides the index of this.

442
00:53:25,062 --> 00:53:29,682
The index and adamant must be must lie in this subset.

443
00:53:29,682 --> 00:53:34,641
Exactly. So I think the confusing part is a notation.

444
00:53:34,642 --> 00:53:41,242
Do you have that? I didn't have that right. So X is a given realization of the data, but the Y is an index.

445
00:53:42,352 --> 00:53:49,312
So now so this is the distribution for key and then I use that for the probability write down.

446
00:53:49,612 --> 00:53:57,891
So to write the job that is written for t are using the retail text but because you see so by you learn how you will find that these

447
00:53:57,892 --> 00:54:07,122
retail acts to get this you know a function so that is a TMX and so then I write this and then and then you see that here if you

448
00:54:07,132 --> 00:54:15,321
are with this retail exit and then apply the fact again again so the distribution x have it was an allergy time H and now I notice

449
00:54:15,322 --> 00:54:22,882
that even though Y is an index so the Whiteland and Edmonton so if you use in this example you will see that if X is equal to zero,

450
00:54:22,882 --> 00:54:29,302
the Obama is like evil x, but the idea of x is a single number equal to what the puzzle is on t.

451
00:54:29,302 --> 00:54:35,762
This subset actually include many elements. In this particular case, the A's otherwise equal three elements.

452
00:54:36,052 --> 00:54:41,092
So the Y can be in the first element could be a second element, which could be the third element.

453
00:54:41,542 --> 00:54:47,872
But regardless of which element, it is the team that has to be constant here y must be equal to black.

454
00:54:47,902 --> 00:54:50,792
So if we do that we could all post more x y.

455
00:54:50,962 --> 00:55:00,022
So therefore t0 watch it does not depend on class in itself is not dependent on y, so therefore it's come removed outside of the summation.

456
00:55:00,292 --> 00:55:03,712
So that is what I did. So I move this outside of summation.

457
00:55:03,922 --> 00:55:12,702
Then these can be translated by a new way to denominator. And then what that means is that these ratio now these mater you'll see that it

458
00:55:12,712 --> 00:55:20,932
has our dependency for I showed that these ratio does not depend on see how

459
00:55:21,352 --> 00:55:28,962
they are full by the theorem 6 to 2 P in a sufficient statistic for Z so let's

460
00:55:28,972 --> 00:55:34,372
just so these zero in this direction z and large one how such a fluctuation.

461
00:55:34,382 --> 00:55:38,512
If you find the fluctuation of this, then x must be sufficient.

462
00:55:38,812 --> 00:55:45,352
Then you find a sufficient statistic. So these actually give us a tool for finding sufficient statistic.

463
00:55:45,532 --> 00:55:52,821
And all you need to do is you write down the joint distribution and try to to, to see if you can find the fluctuation.

464
00:55:52,822 --> 00:56:00,982
Once you find the population, you find a sufficient statistic. And so these full fluctuations, you.

465
00:56:04,792 --> 00:56:13,572
Here. Let's see more examples, because so far I think it's the old abstract.

466
00:56:14,982 --> 00:56:18,582
Well, let's look at Trump's example. So.

467
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:22,241
So remember the only that, for example,

468
00:56:22,242 --> 00:56:32,052
we have data for x I from arbitrary distribution and I proposed a statistic that in a subtitle exact let

469
00:56:32,052 --> 00:56:38,742
me check that it can be a sufficient and I suppose I don't have an idea what is a sufficient statistic.

470
00:56:38,922 --> 00:56:43,302
I just want you to find a sufficient statistic. What do we then use?

471
00:56:43,302 --> 00:56:50,922
The fluctuations. So let's see how we can do that. So to use the fluctuations in, you need a fourth ideology ideologies which are your data.

472
00:56:51,282 --> 00:56:54,912
So this the joint distribution is just a product from larger distribution.

473
00:56:55,092 --> 00:56:59,712
So this is a job of division. So now we need to.

474
00:57:01,062 --> 00:57:08,532
So why don't you think what we do is we need to work with the joint distribution to see whether you can simplify,

475
00:57:09,222 --> 00:57:15,402
whether you can write this as a product that will function T and H.

476
00:57:15,912 --> 00:57:20,442
So actually, the trick is that. So, so let's first simplify this.

477
00:57:20,832 --> 00:57:33,872
So these the joint is usually the product of is P so to the power of X on time minus P to a minus x.

478
00:57:34,692 --> 00:57:45,462
So the trick is I try to separate T and X, so I try to separate your prime to an X and peel.

479
00:57:45,852 --> 00:57:51,402
You cannot separate anymore. And that is the trick. So here, actually, I cannot separate much.

480
00:57:51,762 --> 00:58:04,241
So you see that? So these p these P here in relation to a text, you can you cannot separate the P and X and also these P in a related sort of x,

481
00:58:04,242 --> 00:58:07,962
you cannot separate them, so you cannot separate them.

482
00:58:08,112 --> 00:58:11,532
They just call this as a T because I gave you a T about it.

483
00:58:11,772 --> 00:58:17,032
So you see here this piece this and then I call these as my P, the P for poverty.

484
00:58:17,262 --> 00:58:22,392
Now while minus P, minus T, and then the whole thing actually is the g function.

485
00:58:23,052 --> 00:58:29,312
So these hosting in this G function and then what are the x your h functioning of H function in the trivial.

486
00:58:29,652 --> 00:58:34,242
They just love to see that. So they I mean, we are going to see how the example is.

487
00:58:34,482 --> 00:58:43,872
So trick in try to separate your x and the Prime as much as possible for those that cannot be separated and put the whole into your t function.

488
00:58:44,022 --> 00:58:50,232
7590. So here this I define because I cannot I know I cannot separate the pen accent.

489
00:58:50,442 --> 00:58:51,582
Now I just call the whole thing.

490
00:58:51,602 --> 00:58:59,442
And so this is the T and this and then the whole thing is a part of a T about if your h x a the trivial form, the constant.

491
00:59:00,042 --> 00:59:05,052
So here you see that I find a g that is a function of this t,

492
00:59:05,382 --> 00:59:10,302
x and also functional p and over eight is a function of x only and a this

493
00:59:10,302 --> 00:59:14,532
actually is a trivial function concept budget and they are by the equation zero.

494
00:59:14,832 --> 00:59:18,162
Then the summation of X is a sufficient statistic of 40.

495
00:59:25,302 --> 00:59:32,142
So you see that by using the factual evidence you are, even though that you have no idea what is a sufficient statistics.

496
00:59:32,622 --> 00:59:39,792
And then I will convey that the joint distribution that you have, you have found sufficient statistics.

497
00:59:40,452 --> 00:59:47,202
Yeah, I guess this is what makes you excited because this your distribution depend on peer through this racial exemption.

498
00:59:49,092 --> 00:59:53,522
And so how can you show that accurate.

499
00:59:53,532 --> 01:00:04,762
So what about the average so let's say so now we find that a statistic and this is the reason that.

500
01:00:09,852 --> 01:00:13,872
And you actually in this situation are not. Yes.

501
01:00:14,322 --> 01:00:14,982
Yes. Right.

502
01:00:15,012 --> 01:00:22,091
Because, you know, some say, you know, average if you don't have a you know, some agency and that this you give us the same information about people.

503
01:00:22,092 --> 01:00:27,822
But it's so how do I show that you see that here if I call this that my t now I just different.

504
01:00:27,852 --> 01:00:47,202
So then there's a change so there's going to be a job description is p from and times p1x minus p minus one x.

505
01:00:48,582 --> 01:01:02,472
Right. And then I defined my g t p as a p and t minus p minus.

506
01:01:04,032 --> 01:01:08,022
I call this t one. I see that.

507
01:01:08,202 --> 01:01:23,622
Then the job distribution is t t by p h x notation.

508
01:01:24,222 --> 01:01:30,222
This is he wants to see that by fluctuation.

509
01:01:30,912 --> 01:01:42,512
Also show is average is least sufficient statistic but so he wants sufficient.

510
01:01:44,582 --> 01:01:49,572
So actually there are many ways to find the fluctuation.

511
01:01:49,902 --> 01:01:55,632
If you have a different amount, you will find a different. So if he's in a statistical.

512
01:01:59,612 --> 01:02:06,392
See if you can find another sufficient certification. All right.

513
01:02:07,922 --> 01:02:24,481
Let's move on to another example. So on this example, this is the normal distribution anomalies, which are we already showed this on average.

514
01:02:24,482 --> 01:02:31,202
It doesn't fit a statistic for me. So so we did.

515
01:02:31,322 --> 01:02:38,762
So what we need to do that we would propose a statistic that is average and then check that it is indeed a sufficient.

516
01:02:39,182 --> 01:02:43,862
I suppose I have no idea what is a sufficient statistic. I just want to find the sufficient statistic.

517
01:02:45,092 --> 01:02:54,422
So. So then what we can do is now use the factory consumers to use the factory agency, use a new tool.

518
01:02:54,482 --> 01:03:02,422
Walk me the job distribution. So it is a walk with the job distribution and previously.

519
01:03:02,882 --> 01:03:07,562
So we we showed that the job distribution can be written in this.

520
01:03:08,882 --> 01:03:14,372
So remember, what I did is that I expand the summation X minus music.

521
01:03:14,942 --> 01:03:18,842
And I did that by adding X bar at minus x.

522
01:03:19,082 --> 01:03:22,682
Right. So so I said, I got this, too. So this is a job distribution.

523
01:03:23,552 --> 01:03:31,382
So now you see that I said what they're trying to do is to separate x alemu as much as possible.

524
01:03:31,742 --> 01:03:37,922
You'll see that this part that now I panel this part, they're not depending on me.

525
01:03:38,672 --> 01:03:43,562
So. So what? So then I put all those independent into my speech function.

526
01:03:43,832 --> 01:03:52,082
So then I define my age function as these times this and here the x minus new square.

527
01:03:52,682 --> 01:04:03,542
Since that's not an easy way to separate the f file from the new anymore, but then if they cannot be separated, I put them into the g function.

528
01:04:04,052 --> 01:04:08,342
So I defined this x by I've met them. I define my g function.

529
01:04:08,402 --> 01:04:11,942
The g t u is the function of this t.

530
01:04:12,272 --> 01:04:18,572
And so if you define this way now, you find your h function, you find a g function.

531
01:04:18,782 --> 01:04:28,592
And then this is a sufficient statistic and x even for x park is a sufficient statistic for me and the factory since you.

532
01:04:36,742 --> 01:04:42,072
Question here. Now actions are many different ways.

533
01:04:43,092 --> 01:04:48,532
This is not the only explanation. So because so high.

534
01:04:48,762 --> 01:05:00,762
So we find this fact right here because I use the trigger remember as expand the know the so we are total and minus x plus x.

535
01:05:00,762 --> 01:05:04,122
But I use a trick previously. Now suppose I don't know.

536
01:05:04,332 --> 01:05:07,842
I do know this trick. And now how do you do so?

537
01:05:09,072 --> 01:05:13,572
So let's see. Let's look at this example again.

538
01:05:14,922 --> 01:05:19,242
So suppose I want to find a sufficient statistic.

539
01:05:19,482 --> 01:05:25,392
I want to use the fluctuations U.N. So I know that to do that, I need to look at your distribution.

540
01:05:32,132 --> 01:05:45,692
So the German distribution is equal to these two pi sigma squared for a and about two and then I have exponential.

541
01:05:53,642 --> 01:06:04,112
It's nice and this is the joint distributions and then kind of set the trick in use efficiency or is hypothetical

542
01:06:04,112 --> 01:06:09,452
you acts and me so I have it so here this you don't need to consider this now this is just the constant.

543
01:06:09,962 --> 01:06:13,732
So I have x out of you here. So I want a separate accidentally.

544
01:06:14,072 --> 01:06:28,442
So that is what I'm going to do. So I'm going to expand as we all talk.

545
01:06:33,952 --> 01:06:43,952
So if I expand this word, Tom and I have x squared plus you square minus two mean x.

546
01:06:46,922 --> 01:06:50,642
So you see that? Ah, so this type only depend of x.

547
01:06:51,722 --> 01:06:56,132
That needs to depend on me. I try this, I try to separate X from you.

548
01:06:56,552 --> 01:07:02,792
And this would be kind of both new and exact in that there's no way I can separate them anymore.

549
01:07:03,452 --> 01:07:10,472
So now I will collect all the moment. That's only involving X to the page function.

550
01:07:10,892 --> 01:07:28,202
So I have to hide. And.

551
01:07:47,042 --> 01:07:50,462
So now we're overnight learning that each function. What is it to your function?

552
01:07:51,012 --> 01:07:54,722
Receive this part here. This part of here.

553
01:07:54,722 --> 01:07:59,342
All independent, all extract. So they should be part of your X function.

554
01:07:59,912 --> 01:08:10,492
And this part D panel, both new and X it's that depends on new and X through the summit submission X that that

555
01:08:10,772 --> 01:08:24,482
doesn't call this amazing x and but he x so now he doesn't need to define age of x as to.

556
01:08:38,842 --> 01:08:52,582
And I define tea bags as summation extract and then define g t new as exponential of.

557
01:08:58,752 --> 01:09:02,442
And spread the virus to you.

558
01:09:04,572 --> 01:09:18,432
And then I find that vaccination because that's your distribution is equal to age function.

559
01:09:19,902 --> 01:09:38,252
G. He smoked eggs and they are full pasteurization nation's.

560
01:09:42,662 --> 01:09:51,272
Summation of exercise is sufficient for me.

561
01:09:54,762 --> 01:09:58,802
I see that there are actually different ways to find pathways.

562
01:09:59,712 --> 01:10:03,512
Sometimes different fluctuation can give you that, says the patient statistics.

563
01:10:03,922 --> 01:10:11,072
Sometimes you may find defense official statistics you think shows the.

564
01:10:11,322 --> 01:10:15,492
So here you see that I showed you the summation is a sufficient statistic right here.

565
01:10:15,492 --> 01:10:22,722
I showed it to the f the the average is sufficient statistic that for you at this point you can also show the average.

566
01:10:24,162 --> 01:10:30,012
So for think I'm a here that here if I define the TMX as the average and then so this

567
01:10:30,012 --> 01:10:38,262
part will be to you times and HANNITY that you can show folks that this affects the

568
01:10:38,262 --> 01:10:45,581
average and that's I might have been a sufficient statistic so that different are a

569
01:10:45,582 --> 01:10:49,302
sufficient statistic but these are different approximations either given the facts racial.

570
01:10:58,242 --> 01:11:02,562
Yes. They consider and contain all parameters.

571
01:11:03,252 --> 01:11:07,731
I mean, not a problem here. So. So in this particular.

572
01:11:07,732 --> 01:11:12,462
It depends on the question. Depends on the question here.

573
01:11:13,122 --> 01:11:20,202
My question is if x ie has a normal distribution and in my sample is x,

574
01:11:20,472 --> 01:11:25,622
so x and you've known to some it is not constant throughout a prime time, right.

575
01:11:25,712 --> 01:11:30,282
In some question. So you may have the number, you may collect your data.

576
01:11:30,592 --> 01:11:33,991
Are you do you do it on your end? Neither one.

577
01:11:33,992 --> 01:11:38,882
Then it would be a private any time line.

578
01:11:38,892 --> 01:11:46,632
Some space right here. If I didn't say that the data is a constant sample size something a maybe.

579
01:11:46,732 --> 01:11:54,762
I tell you I have a distribution in the parameter and it may be viewed as private, so it depends on the question.

580
01:12:00,902 --> 01:12:09,422
And in in practice your samples can also be a parameter will be a be a concern or

581
01:12:09,422 --> 01:12:16,272
even be run so is until you you say and you collect data and you go to 100 that

582
01:12:16,322 --> 01:12:21,032
using the concept a sample you may you may see you might have a different design

583
01:12:21,062 --> 01:12:24,982
and you collect connect data and he or something happens in that case you a.

584
01:12:28,612 --> 01:12:32,332
All right, let's look at another example.

585
01:12:34,042 --> 01:12:50,122
So here I have data I.D. from a uniform distribution, discrete uniform distribution, so that I can take any number from ones who are full figure.

586
01:12:50,782 --> 01:12:57,742
See, that is an integer. So this is a discrete uniform distribution.

587
01:12:58,642 --> 01:13:01,942
So for this distribution carried on the PMF threat.

588
01:13:02,122 --> 01:13:07,072
So if if X is any of the integers between one to ACA.

589
01:13:07,282 --> 01:13:11,112
So the probability would be what all of us call is uniform draw for.

590
01:13:11,772 --> 01:13:16,972
That's for from these numbers. So all so each of them you have probably debatable.

591
01:13:17,992 --> 01:13:24,022
But if your x is not from these integers, then the problem is zero.

592
01:13:24,322 --> 01:13:36,082
So this is the PMF. And I want to start and I want to find a sufficient statistic.

593
01:13:37,882 --> 01:13:47,782
So using the factoid, Nancy, actually, at this point, if you want to find a sufficient statistic, you can only have the fluctuations here.

594
01:13:48,142 --> 01:13:56,572
Otherwise, we can guess that you need to get some of the use of the definition of zero 6 to 12 to check whether your guess is sufficient or not.

595
01:13:56,752 --> 01:14:02,792
That is not easy. So so you see that this is a higher rise.

596
01:14:02,792 --> 01:14:06,702
So the IMF.

597
01:14:07,222 --> 01:14:14,362
So so that actually that is a different way to write the path and that is more convenient.

598
01:14:14,722 --> 01:14:21,442
So how many you have after the indicator function? So how do you have call indicative function?

599
01:14:22,312 --> 01:14:25,372
So I can define an indicator function.

600
01:14:25,552 --> 01:14:28,612
So I is an indicator function.

601
01:14:30,772 --> 01:14:39,862
Is it just a more convenient a notation? So I found by a for example, is it equal to a warren or zero.

602
01:14:40,072 --> 01:14:49,162
So if a in two that is involved, then it is not two, it is zero.

603
01:14:53,402 --> 01:15:02,222
So if I write, so if I use this notation, so you'll see that actually I can write a CMS.

604
01:15:03,032 --> 01:15:13,292
So the probability of x equal to the probability of x equal to our small x.

605
01:15:14,252 --> 01:15:17,452
So you see, that depends on what small x is.

606
01:15:17,462 --> 01:15:20,792
But if more x is equal to negative one, what is this probability?

607
01:15:24,412 --> 01:15:33,142
What are the probability that X is equal to an actual one? The zero is not possible because x is is drawn from these integers.

608
01:15:34,072 --> 01:15:37,282
So the x cannot be equal to an actual well. So.

609
01:15:37,522 --> 01:15:44,692
So here. But I want to use so I can't. So I mean, this is always an indicator function.

610
01:15:45,382 --> 01:15:49,132
X belongs to. Y to.

611
01:15:52,192 --> 01:15:58,582
So you see that I don't have to have this tool situation, but the facts being about this provision of X is otherwise.

612
01:15:58,752 --> 01:16:02,562
But I just use notation. So you see that.

613
01:16:02,572 --> 01:16:05,902
So it doesn't mean that the problem is equal to a lot of us data.

614
01:16:06,142 --> 01:16:16,072
If X in the bottom of this integers and if x is not within this, that the indicator function would be zero, the whole problem is zero.

615
01:16:16,882 --> 01:16:21,592
So here is just a more convenient notation.

616
01:16:24,622 --> 01:16:30,952
And now using this notation we can we can find a sufficient statistic.

617
01:16:31,502 --> 01:16:37,182
So. So to use on the factory ten zero only to use r,

618
01:16:38,692 --> 01:16:43,222
I need a right on the joint distribution plan so that your distribution in the

619
01:16:43,222 --> 01:16:53,482
problem is to expire equal to the next one x to do x to an x and you control x.

620
01:16:54,052 --> 01:17:02,152
So this is the distribution of the entire sample. So this is the product of the master distribution.

621
01:17:02,512 --> 01:17:08,242
And I have seen that I didn't just use the indicator function and in 1998 it is more convenient.

622
01:17:08,692 --> 01:17:16,882
So even a function of x I want to find.

623
01:17:22,122 --> 01:17:28,242
Let's do that. So if I had not had this indicative function, then how do you sex Eve, ex Adam and Eve?

624
01:17:28,512 --> 01:17:32,502
I invite them to have two situations and that is not having it.

625
01:17:32,772 --> 01:17:38,592
I know I can have that now. I just do this one line right out the master distribution.

626
01:17:40,482 --> 01:17:44,342
And so he's.

627
01:17:50,332 --> 01:17:56,472
So I have the product while I'm always there, so I can almost see the end times.

628
01:17:56,482 --> 01:18:01,462
But there's something we all will see that's a lot of other indicator functions.

629
01:18:02,302 --> 01:18:09,792
So I have. So what about this indicator function?

630
01:18:12,192 --> 01:18:17,312
So that's a hub.

631
01:18:18,432 --> 01:18:31,472
So I'm going to write this thing a slightly different way than Oliver, see her indicator, and so on.

632
01:18:33,072 --> 01:18:43,632
So as I said. I tried to separate acts and see them in the immediate as indicator function to actually see that they are together.

633
01:18:43,732 --> 01:18:46,922
Right. So, so. So what part of this statement mean?

634
01:18:46,942 --> 01:18:47,661
So this day,

635
01:18:47,662 --> 01:19:07,162
two mistakes that X had to be equal to one or two or three opposing in this mean x has to be an integer and also x has to be that's not equal to C,

636
01:19:07,852 --> 01:19:21,412
so. So X and so this means X, it would be down to one, two, and all of those are natural integer paths with integer numbers and.

637
01:19:23,662 --> 01:19:31,542
And of course, to reverse that, you could have seen it. It is the same statement is the same statement.

638
01:19:31,552 --> 01:19:37,252
It doesn't rise is the idea from the an you go in the first May you see that facts are so.

639
01:19:37,402 --> 01:19:40,322
So this is a global statement and not the I.

640
01:19:40,602 --> 01:19:48,722
I know that in this statement that all information, the one piece one piece of information is that it has to be smaller than smaller than you know.

641
01:19:49,102 --> 01:19:55,882
Another piece of information is XA has to be a positive integer, a separate there's one piece of information out.

642
01:19:57,892 --> 01:20:08,782
And so now I have always c tied to a apple because I have a product that here I have.

643
01:20:12,382 --> 01:20:17,482
So I have the product of this many any kind of functions.

644
01:20:18,772 --> 01:20:21,532
But what happens with this indicator functions?

645
01:20:22,432 --> 01:20:30,532
So if all indicate the function in the bar, then the product is black, red, if any of that in zero zero.

646
01:20:31,072 --> 01:20:34,402
So. So this actually. So you order. So actually.

647
01:20:36,502 --> 01:20:44,802
So that means a result. I can. I actually want you to confront gender inequality.

648
01:20:45,042 --> 01:20:59,202
I'd rather hear the problem in front of A and B B the indicator of a trans indicate health and indicator of all as things happens.

649
01:20:59,262 --> 01:21:06,612
I for I want to earn it equal to the product of indicator function.

650
01:21:07,812 --> 01:21:09,522
So for Hallgrimsson,

651
01:21:09,522 --> 01:21:17,382
this doesn't mean that the oral for this in the article this size will be why it doesn't mean that all either has to happen or they had to be true.

652
01:21:18,222 --> 01:21:24,012
So. So. Here and there. If I go back. So these just means that.

653
01:21:24,252 --> 01:21:27,932
Wow. For Andropov. He. Huh? Huh.

654
01:21:28,362 --> 01:21:32,412
So this probably you think the following can be how long you can live up to that.

655
01:21:32,652 --> 01:21:41,402
So is an indicator of all of this in the House to be true. So this means that x I should be allowed to lie.

656
01:21:44,612 --> 01:21:51,272
Thanks a lot. Eggs are proud to be a part of fine tune and.

657
01:21:54,232 --> 01:21:58,522
I've had some lessons set up for a bit.

658
01:21:58,852 --> 01:22:07,312
So this notation means that. So this notation means any.

659
01:22:12,432 --> 01:22:22,332
So this material means everything. So this has to be true for all the eyes and then of us for the look at this statement.

660
01:22:22,752 --> 01:22:31,062
So this statement said X had to be a part of images and all of an X has to be innocent, equal to some of this information.

661
01:22:31,332 --> 01:22:35,592
If all are if all the X has to be able to figure out what does this mean?

662
01:22:38,022 --> 01:22:44,742
And you there's some concern with this. You've mentioned it's the maximum has to be lost, right?

663
01:22:44,772 --> 01:22:48,972
Yeah. So if all the X has been S that you couldn't see, let's just see this.

664
01:22:49,062 --> 01:22:55,862
So this just means that the maximum of the X has to be that's the maximum that you could see that the.

665
01:22:55,872 --> 01:22:57,672
All of that must be. That's it. You can see that.

666
01:22:57,882 --> 01:23:15,132
So this is again, the function actually is X must be belong to a positive integer and the maximum of that's that you will see.

667
01:23:16,662 --> 01:23:27,362
Now I said the trick is to separate x and theta and what had possible the C that this part the append magnets,

668
01:23:27,552 --> 01:23:30,672
this part penalty that there's no way you can separate this part.

669
01:23:31,332 --> 01:23:36,992
What about this part? Misinformation. This pardon our dependency.

670
01:23:37,832 --> 01:23:44,482
And also, you see that I said here, the indicator of A and B is, is this indicator eight highly negative.

671
01:23:45,212 --> 01:23:50,152
So you can separate these part, the first part and the second part into tuning the function.

672
01:23:50,412 --> 01:23:56,642
Right? So this that you go to the bottom. Indicator.

673
01:23:58,232 --> 01:24:04,262
X. Y. Z. Last two positive integer for.

674
01:24:07,342 --> 01:24:11,212
And the prime indicator of.

675
01:24:14,672 --> 01:24:25,142
Yeah. So let's put in here. Let's put this part of his farm over here.

676
01:24:25,662 --> 01:24:32,892
Indicate a maximum of X, Y and Z.

677
01:24:34,512 --> 01:24:40,591
So if you do this. So what is their age function?

678
01:24:40,592 --> 01:24:51,532
What is your do you function? You see these pot seats, these are all independent assets.

679
01:24:51,782 --> 01:25:05,552
So you can call this part of your function and this the second part of dependency and dependent on x, dependent X to the maximum of the maximum.

680
01:25:06,332 --> 01:25:13,172
So now so you can define. So I define.

681
01:25:15,972 --> 01:25:31,602
He attacks the maximum attacks, loud attacks, and I call this X parenthesis, and then you find g of TV.

682
01:25:32,532 --> 01:25:42,102
These are ads while all of us these are often times indicator function t this that you control.

683
01:25:45,472 --> 01:26:02,092
And the age of X Indicator X, I want you to scroll down and be active.

684
01:26:03,832 --> 01:26:19,042
So if you do find these and then I showed that your distribution is equal to page X, high g.

685
01:26:22,382 --> 01:26:29,702
The law needs to be sufficient.

686
01:26:35,572 --> 01:26:39,292
Statistics? Well, yes.

687
01:26:43,832 --> 01:26:47,372
Termination SEO.

688
01:26:49,802 --> 01:26:56,012
So let's look at this example one one time.

689
01:26:57,092 --> 01:27:03,722
So here, first of all, I think it's useful to know how to use indicator function to simplify the location.

690
01:27:05,252 --> 01:27:09,242
And also you need to know about the property before you look at the function.

691
01:27:09,512 --> 01:27:13,672
The indicator photo and B is the same indicator eight times.

692
01:27:13,682 --> 01:27:20,612
Be an indicator of all the events to be the same as the product indicator function.

693
01:27:20,612 --> 01:27:30,572
What each about. So now. So what we need again we look at your distribution and on here the x I has given all this integers

694
01:27:31,202 --> 01:27:36,962
and that's equal for half of a how is this information in your proposal of so etc. this statement,

695
01:27:36,962 --> 01:27:43,442
your little piece of information and then I know that X has to be part of integers and x, I had to be able to see it.

696
01:27:44,132 --> 01:27:48,002
And then so. So here how help you do the functions.

697
01:27:48,272 --> 01:27:52,322
I'll write this as an indicator of these and these.

698
01:27:52,832 --> 01:28:05,342
And now I recognize that all the x factor we less equal see her in a same as the maxima of this I even with that and now a separate

699
01:28:05,342 --> 01:28:13,682
x and see now so these cannot be separated they will be part of the g function and this part has nothing to do with here.

700
01:28:13,922 --> 01:28:18,092
But I could do this as part of the h function. Now I have a function.

701
01:28:18,812 --> 01:28:23,962
So here I showed the maximum e and so if you have a statistical force,

702
01:28:23,992 --> 01:28:31,142
you have this creativity and actually computer to make sense when you have a data draw wrongly from it is a

703
01:28:31,222 --> 01:28:37,232
uniform distribution in prime of a vacuum setup and of course the maximum can give you information about it.

704
01:28:37,652 --> 01:28:44,402
So if you maximize the file, you know, you'll see that must be greater than or equal to account carbon the maximum.

705
01:28:44,402 --> 01:28:48,002
I can give you some information now.

706
01:28:48,392 --> 01:28:51,902
Some student may ask, So what if I don't recognize this part?

707
01:28:52,292 --> 01:29:01,052
So what if I don't know I can separate x i so so this information into a two piece of information then I can

708
01:29:01,052 --> 01:29:08,222
not find this official statistic to what can you find sufficient to do that if you cannot recognize it?

709
01:29:08,792 --> 01:29:17,492
So the all the x equals zero is the same and the maximum I if give is not recognized is I used to find a sufficient statistic.

710
01:29:20,102 --> 01:29:24,982
You can still find a sufficient statistic, but you will not be able to find a good sufficient.

711
01:29:25,702 --> 01:29:29,252
So simply you do not know this simple as the most you have. So this is what you can do.

712
01:29:29,582 --> 01:29:37,981
So, Paul, you end here and the full statement here now one in insufficient statistics you see here.

713
01:29:37,982 --> 01:29:47,702
So this simple, this is a motive and I'll simplify this animal now this function dependency that and depend on Xbox One X and that and then you

714
01:29:47,702 --> 01:29:56,491
are sufficient statistic then you can define it each X as like each and every time you come here to the project name all this,

715
01:29:56,492 --> 01:30:06,032
all the value added function you the opinion you are key will be your key exit information that your to be xyx2x.

716
01:30:06,032 --> 01:30:09,692
Then I think a sufficient statistic is a reason to be that.

717
01:30:09,992 --> 01:30:18,212
So you still can't find a sufficient statistic. And this official statistic is not very useful because you do not get a good summary

718
01:30:18,452 --> 01:30:22,651
is basically so it is sufficient that not all the information becomes easy.

719
01:30:22,652 --> 01:30:26,942
Your regime is not simple. And so that's why.

720
01:30:26,942 --> 01:30:40,922
So it's always so you should of this title see how I can separate the the the X and on the see them and also use a simpler question here.

721
01:30:43,412 --> 01:30:47,942
So all of our guess the question whether we actually use the indicator function

722
01:30:48,152 --> 01:30:53,912
or use this actually I would always recommend writing the PDF Use Indicator

723
01:30:53,912 --> 01:31:05,962
function when it is making it applicable because this is not convenient and you need to do some mathematic operation of the go to write to use it in.

724
01:31:11,422 --> 01:31:16,462
All right. We will not be able to finish this particular staff yet.

725
01:31:16,792 --> 01:31:20,512
So you are our example so far. We only have one friend.

726
01:31:20,692 --> 01:31:26,512
You don't have to see her as your prime to kind of be a multiple dimensional example here.

727
01:31:26,662 --> 01:31:34,972
If we have a normal distribution and a New York thing must be a book and not so is it, now you'll see that in the vector.

728
01:31:35,692 --> 01:31:44,062
So this is a two dimensional I'm trying to crack. So these are the tools that we can still find.

729
01:31:46,042 --> 01:31:49,492
We have still found a sufficient statistic for you and Sigma Square together.

730
01:31:50,212 --> 01:31:54,562
So. So found.

731
01:31:59,272 --> 01:32:02,322
So he has. Let's see how we can do this.

732
01:32:02,662 --> 01:32:05,832
So here, if I want you to find us a sufficient statistic.

733
01:32:06,072 --> 01:32:11,412
So if you are lucky, if you can propose what they are, use the definition to check whether sufficient.

734
01:32:11,742 --> 01:32:13,182
This is what we do not know that.

735
01:32:13,392 --> 01:32:21,812
Now, how can they use fluctuations, consume to decompose this joint distribution to well find the fluctuations you will find the fluctuation.

736
01:32:22,852 --> 01:32:28,072
So. So what we are going to do is we start with the user.

737
01:32:28,482 --> 01:32:34,062
So this is a job description of a novel that that is a product market distribution.

738
01:32:34,452 --> 01:32:42,582
And we have this and I see here I use the to get that so that you have seen this before.

739
01:32:42,822 --> 01:32:53,322
So I'm excited minus new square. So what I do in a minus X plus Xbox and expand is grow, tell and uses as opposed to a view.

740
01:32:53,342 --> 01:32:56,712
These are the segment, Tom and a video. See, that's the cross plot.

741
01:32:56,712 --> 01:33:06,192
I tell you the equals. So you don't have to write anymore. So if I do that and then this is my on this version that I you find a sufficient statistic.

742
01:33:06,672 --> 01:33:10,452
So you see that here all is the new single square.

743
01:33:10,452 --> 01:33:12,402
They are printed. They're not constant.

744
01:33:12,552 --> 01:33:19,452
In my previous example, I need to see must have a constant right here Sigma Square on it and the me with both parameters.

745
01:33:19,812 --> 01:33:24,642
So here you can see that the X bar release tool credible and I'll separate the animal.

746
01:33:25,662 --> 01:33:30,162
And I look at this part. So these are the pen release tool or Sigma Smith.

747
01:33:30,662 --> 01:33:37,992
And I reckon you can now separate the animal. So in this case, so what do you do is you define a two dimensional statistic.

748
01:33:38,292 --> 01:33:45,682
So we see so you can call these by the keyword, you can call these and you add to that.

749
01:33:46,332 --> 01:33:52,962
So if I do that, you're going to see that. So so this is just distribution.

750
01:33:53,142 --> 01:34:02,772
I call heel X to actually a two dimensional the fourth dimension I hit by the second divided here and Heba is equal to this part.

751
01:34:03,432 --> 01:34:07,362
So Piva in equal to this part. And he who is this whole thing?

752
01:34:08,022 --> 01:34:12,192
And if I do so this is my keyboard and this is my key tool.

753
01:34:13,602 --> 01:34:17,382
So you see. And then Benito AX in a trivial function is a constant.

754
01:34:17,922 --> 01:34:27,222
The whole draw distribution is my G function and this G function is related to the Sigma Square and AMU to the sequel and Heba.

755
01:34:27,722 --> 01:34:33,102
And then the joint distribution can be factored into this G function to this each function.

756
01:34:33,482 --> 01:34:39,522
Therefore, these together, these are sufficient statistics for the average.

757
01:34:40,062 --> 01:34:46,092
And these this in here, they together are sufficient for you a.s.a.p.

758
01:34:47,472 --> 01:34:51,392
So Sophie's instances, it may not be one dimensional. It could be a multiplication.

759
01:34:54,822 --> 01:34:57,482
I think this is it for today. And here.
