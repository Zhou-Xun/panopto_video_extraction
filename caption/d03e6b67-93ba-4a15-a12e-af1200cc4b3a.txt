1
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:15,750
I'm going to start from the. But.

2
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:21,740
You can read. All right.

3
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:59,390
If you. It's important.

4
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:17,300
Wow. That's. I.

5
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:29,070
No. Yeah, but not your last.

6
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:34,550
Not looking back. How is it?

7
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:51,370
While. You owe me.

8
00:01:52,410 --> 00:02:02,300
No. Your on. Did you have to go through that?

9
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:06,900
I'm sorry. Yeah. No, I know.

10
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:14,150
Yeah, I'm sorry. I had no idea what I was doing.

11
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:19,650
I was still looking at it. Think. Oh, yeah.

12
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,500
Huh? It's just not the right thing.

13
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:40,120
Today's. The main reason we don't have a lot.

14
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:52,450
And they were right about. The one that was supposed to be okay.

15
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,180
But the other one is right. Was. I don't know where you.

16
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:03,130
Okay. I was like a.

17
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:12,130
And he. You say.

18
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:29,750
You're welcome. You're welcome. You're welcome. Good.

19
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:36,280
Good. Do you want to plug in yourself or do you want me to log in?

20
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:40,850
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Make me better. Okay. Oh.

21
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,570
How are you doing? Very well, thank you. Yeah.

22
00:03:53,690 --> 00:04:17,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah. They went up to Canada in the Northern Territory for hours and did a lot of labor up there.

23
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:24,480
Yeah. Yeah.

24
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:38,700
I didn't get a confirmation. So you just usually when you say.

25
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:52,110
You're welcome. I didn't know what I did. What's that?

26
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:56,700
I don't know what I did, but I. I hit something, and this came up and.

27
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:03,510
Can we get rid of it? I hope so. It's supposed to. Oh, well.

28
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:10,020
Or if we can just get chrome in front. All right? Yeah, something like that, huh?

29
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:18,210
No, I won't let you. Okay, so let's just do it. Mm hmm.

30
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:23,130
What did you do? That's where I have student interns, right?

31
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:27,840
Yeah. When I go down this road, I just saw a college student intern over to help me.

32
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:38,340
So I heard it's just frozen. Whatever going to shoot.

33
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:46,300
Okay. Do you want to set up your plates and stuff?

34
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:51,650
Yeah, I think so. Okay. Okay. Okay.

35
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:56,730
They're going to come. Think.

36
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:07,300
Right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

37
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:23,770
Anyone. Seven over 190.

38
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:40,690
Hi. My name's Kathy Coley. I'm in as one 1022 and we've got a computer glitch and I'm hoping you can help us try it.

39
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:47,770
Lucky I had a colleague who was trying to log in and all of a sudden this thing came up called this antique 22 setup wizard.

40
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:58,270
And now everything seems sort of frozen. Oh, my gosh.

41
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:05,080
Ten, ten, 20 or something? Yes.

42
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:14,570
It was. Describe what?

43
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:22,370
Describe the what? Oh, the problem.

44
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:30,750
I'm sorry. Sorry. My colleague was logging in and this thing popped up called the Cintiq 22 setup wizard.

45
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:34,739
Set up your Cintiq 22 in a few easy steps. Welcome start.

46
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:42,840
And it won't start and you can't close out of it and you can't get too close to be able to sign in and get the slides.

47
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:53,920
No. No.

48
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:02,130
Welcome, welcome and starch and won't let you close out of it and let you start it.

49
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:22,880
We? Okay.

50
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,930
Thanks. Would it be better if we just tried to shut down and start again?

51
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:41,509
You can. All right.

52
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:50,100
Thanks. Thanks. I'm just going to sign you out and see if we can do three to it.

53
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:53,850
Yeah. And he said he's going to try to send somebody down here.

54
00:08:54,990 --> 00:09:09,810
Okay. Do you wanna try again? Sure. Okay.

55
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:35,790
So far so good. Yeah. Okay. So now. We?

56
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:55,930
This is. Yeah.

57
00:09:56,390 --> 00:10:02,930
She wants to do it. Oh, I love that.

58
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:06,880
Send me her purse. Yeah. Good morning.

59
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:13,350
How are you? You know, obviously, I didn't get there.

60
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:20,050
I know where she is.

61
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:32,860
Oh, no, it's.

62
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,120
Okay. I'm ready. Okay, let's turn this on.

63
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:06,260
Coming up. Good. Good, good, good.

64
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:14,500
Great. And I don't think there's a clicker in here.

65
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:18,730
Okay. I don't think, you know, I've got a pretty big mouth on me.

66
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,730
I wouldn't have said that. That's okay. I did.

67
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:32,830
Okay. Um, so, you know, we I guess we're just down a few today.

68
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:37,210
Um, I think we should just go ahead. I think it sounds good. All right.

69
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:47,839
So. Hello, everybody. Nice to see you all. Before we get started.

70
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:55,490
Thanks for your patience. If you haven't had a donut yet, or if you know there are a lot of here.

71
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:10,610
I'd like to introduce our speaker. It has a very clear role within guiding.

72
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:17,860
You know, I think we got it sorted out. People were much. While we can do better than that, it's.

73
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:23,450
And he gives a great presentation on.

74
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:29,180
This is. And it sounds like it could be really dry, boring.

75
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:34,360
But it's not. It's kind of funny and you might come away with.

76
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:41,060
I would consider that a success. And the whole reason for having a conversation about.

77
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:47,140
Some of you. Some of you might know it all for sure.

78
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:54,640
And some of you might not. And so it's a great sort of leveler to have at least a conversation about this.

79
00:12:55,010 --> 00:13:00,670
Well, because I want you to feel as confident as possible to go into a situation where you're.

80
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:07,990
The need for a job interview or work situation, you just have to really need stress.

81
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:13,340
And how can we make this easier? That's not.

82
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:19,220
So without further ado, I'm going to introduce Keith, and I think you're going to have a lot of fun.

83
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:25,150
Good morning, everyone. All right. So I want to say this.

84
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:29,230
I talk a lot and I talk really fast because I have a lot of information that I want to share.

85
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:32,979
But I love to be interrupted, especially if you have questions.

86
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:37,420
Right. Because I want you to be able to walk out of here, going to have a whole bunch of stuff out of this.

87
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:46,979
And so I have a slide deck and I know I get tired of slide deck, but that helps me to keep on track.

88
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:47,340
Right.

89
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:55,530
And then I also have a PlayStation down here and at some point I'll make the guys come forward and we can kind of play a navigate around the table.

90
00:13:55,860 --> 00:14:00,900
And the whole goal for me is really to walk away feeling comfortable and confident,

91
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:10,620
navigating the table so that you can focus on this right during the interview and having worked.

92
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:18,530
A long time ago, and I won't even tell you how I'm alive in the interviews that I do, usually around the meal.

93
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:24,250
We want to see how they present themselves and that they can present themselves in a positive way for them.

94
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:29,020
Right. And so you go out there in the real world, there could be.

95
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,700
You're invited to a reception or a seminar or something.

96
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:38,050
You want to be able to navigate. Comfortable and building relationships.

97
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:42,220
So a couple of things I was pointing out.

98
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:48,760
It's not about the food. And that's hard for me to say because the work that we do in dining is all right.

99
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:57,940
And so it's about navigating, presenting yourself in a most positive, professional manner and feeling comfortable and confident.

100
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:04,540
And then I always have these rules. Like, you're like, oh, you're breaking an etiquette rule while safety comes first.

101
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:05,770
I know that sounds bizarre,

102
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:16,030
but I had one person in the situation that I observed one time where I think it was a basketball team because the guy was really tall.

103
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:27,750
Their coach was in one of our. Dining facilities and the person they were recruiting or coming to visit took on a piece of me.

104
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:31,520
Right. And I just stood up and did one of these and somebody was able to help them out.

105
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:37,559
But if that person had, like, you know, the first sign that I've done something stupid,

106
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:41,780
I want to get out of this, you're like, Oh, and then the guy that.

107
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:45,879
Because there's so safety always comes first.

108
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:53,400
And that means I know you might be buying something that's too hot or the soup is too high and you end up with pizza mouth.

109
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:59,650
And we don't want that to happen. We want you to be able to break the protocol and do what's necessary.

110
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:03,210
So safety always comes first, convert comes second, right?

111
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:11,410
And so if something sounds stupid, like I'm giving an example, we're at a roundtable and general rule is you're passing from left to right,

112
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:18,310
but the person to my immediate left asks for the basket or rolls and not so great protocol.

113
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:24,219
I start passing it and it's got to be passing through seven other people in order to get back to the guy next to you.

114
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:30,100
Right. So I would like offering him the role and then continue the path.

115
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:39,610
And so if the rule is stupid, my father always said and I said at the last bit in right for me to convert to the right and so safety first,

116
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,020
then comfort and then advocate.

117
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:50,710
And so if you think about that, with everything that I'm going to talk about, I think that that should prove to be helpful.

118
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,680
And so I hate sitting behind podiums,

119
00:16:53,680 --> 00:17:00,790
but I'm just going to go through here and talk about some general rules and then we'll do some on hands kind of thing.

120
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:04,839
So I want to talk about networking first. I think that's most important.

121
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:07,960
I've been to lots of conferences.

122
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,729
The last conference I went with,

123
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:18,370
I went with like five other colleagues from dining and we go to the conference and we're all kind of like strapped together on our hips, right?

124
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:26,799
So there are people from across the country that I want to meet and everybody feels like, Oh, this is the Michigan team and we have to stick together.

125
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:32,890
No, you don't. And I would hope that if you're with colleagues, you already know those folks.

126
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:38,290
And so the idea is about building relationships and why etiquette.

127
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:42,460
Well, if you know how to properly navigate a situation,

128
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:48,160
you're automatically going to put other people at ease, whether you're the host or simply aghast.

129
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:56,050
And so making the situation comfortable allows for you to build a deeper relationship

130
00:17:56,290 --> 00:18:00,609
and connect with people that you'll want to have further conversations with.

131
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:08,589
The last conference I went to was in Dallas, and since then there are four people that I met there that I've had continued conversations with,

132
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:14,049
which is awesome because a lot of times you'll find that people across the country are doing the same kind of work that you're

133
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:20,440
doing and you want to be able to build off of that and share your knowledge and also glean from others what they've learned,

134
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:26,049
especially when it comes to obstacles and challenges, right? Like I'll be like, don't go down that rabbit hole.

135
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:31,720
This is what happened to me. And so being able to build those kind of relationships is really what you're looking for.

136
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:36,190
And the tagline here at Michigan is Leaders Best, right?

137
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:39,280
And so when others reach out to you and ask questions,

138
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:44,620
you want to be able to convey information to them that puts you in that leaders and does kind of position.

139
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:53,050
And so diversity is important. I think we have a very diverse environment on our campus, but that's not the case everywhere we go.

140
00:18:53,830 --> 00:19:02,469
And so I bring up diversity because I think it's important to understand that there is different cultural norms and circumstances out there,

141
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:07,540
and you want to do your research ahead of time. You know that saying when in Rome, do as the Romans do.

142
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:12,070
Well, if you're going to interview with an international company, do the research.

143
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:18,100
If you want to enter interview with a local company, do your research.

144
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:27,190
So think about this. You may wear something different to interview with IBM than you would with Abercrombie and Fitch.

145
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:31,719
Right. And so you want to think about that. A quick example.

146
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:35,050
Before I worked here at the university, I worked at the Toledo Zoo.

147
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:42,040
My first day. I have on a suit and tie and everybody else has khaki pants and polo shirts on.

148
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:45,220
Right. And I felt kind of over the top, over dress.

149
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:53,560
And so I was able to take off my jacket and undo the tie and have my little, you know, button down accent and feel a little bit more comfortable.

150
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:58,120
So day two, what do you think? I wore khaki pants and a polo shirt.

151
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:07,810
Right. And so doing your research ahead of time allows you to understand what the culture or the norm is within the company and then go from there.

152
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:18,490
So I talked about cultural differences and being in Rome or other places, and I want to talk about some deeper dives under cultural differences,

153
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:25,240
introductions and greetings may be different in Europe, formal introductions are more the norm,

154
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:33,520
and so presenting a business card, say, in Japan, it's more a formal process, right?

155
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:40,959
And so you want to do your research. What I talk about today is really based on American culture and norms.

156
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,260
And so if you Google. Had a kid.

157
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:52,400
There's like not. Well, last time I worked was years ago was like over 9 million different places you can click on.

158
00:20:52,670 --> 00:21:01,610
And so, you know, just think about your surroundings. I have student interns in my office and want one student.

159
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:04,969
This is his first semester in the States.

160
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:12,970
He's from India and he texted me last Wednesday and said I was invited to Thanksgiving dinner and I don't know what to do.

161
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:17,500
Right. And I was like, he was like, what kind of gift do I take?

162
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:22,970
And so I coached him through some of the options that he could take.

163
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:29,450
Well, in some cultures, if you show up with food, they're offended because you you show up and they think,

164
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:32,870
oh, this guy doesn't think I can feed him well enough. Right.

165
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:40,760
And so it's important to do your research. A gift for the host might be appropriate in the States, but maybe not in other places.

166
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:50,540
Holding Silverware. I teach an etiquette dinner for some engineering students, and so is sponsored by BP, British Petroleum.

167
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:56,380
British being the keyword there. And once they pick up their silverware, they don't send it down.

168
00:21:56,390 --> 00:22:04,670
And so being able to give those kind of cues and understanding for students that are maybe interviewing with BP is an important aspect.

169
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:11,330
Silverware like Blue Nile is an Ethiopian restaurant here in Ann Arbor.

170
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:15,830
They don't give you silverware and they'll offer it to you and you can use it.

171
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:20,330
But being able to immerse yourself in the culture and understand what the norms are can

172
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:26,700
be incredibly satisfying and also makes you look like you're culturally intelligent too.

173
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,200
Right. And then things like finishing your food.

174
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,830
In some cultures, if you finish everything on your plate, they're going to keep serving you.

175
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:37,760
Right. And in some cultures, like it's no longer the case.

176
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,820
I grew up in a household. We were a middle lower income.

177
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:46,410
And my dad was like, if you don't finish everything on your plate, you know, you can't have dessert or.

178
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:50,780
This was his famous line. You know, there are children in the world starving.

179
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:54,259
Right. And I'd be like, well, let's wrap it up and send it to those children.

180
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:55,670
And that would [INAUDIBLE] him off. Right.

181
00:22:55,910 --> 00:23:02,030
And so just be thoughtful about cultural differences and make sure that you're doing your research ahead of time.

182
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:06,860
I want to talk briefly about the risk of reception if you're getting invited to a reception,

183
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:10,700
because I think there's some norms there that we need to pay attention to.

184
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:15,560
So when you're making an entrance, I always tell people, show up a little bit ahead of time.

185
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:21,739
And I did this at the last conference that I was in. It was in Dallas, and they were having a reception afterwards.

186
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:25,340
Well, I was one of the first ones there and being one of the first ones there,

187
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:31,790
anybody that comes in after you, they're like, Oh, this dude is part of the welcoming committee or whatever.

188
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:37,160
And I stood near the door. So as people come in and I'm like, Well, you know, welcome, my name is cute, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

189
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:43,670
And so people were just willing to shake my hand and talk a little bit and all that kind of stuff.

190
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:49,729
If you walk in late, there's all these clusters of people everywhere and they're having the best time talking,

191
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:54,040
and then you're like, Okay, excuse me, can you part of your group, right?

192
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:55,160
And it kind of feels weird.

193
00:23:55,430 --> 00:24:05,020
And so if you check in on time, then you have the opportunity to kind of welcome others, but also begin to build those relationships sounds.

194
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:08,870
Keep your phones out of sight. That's at the dinner table as well. If.

195
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:15,909
If I go to a reception, I'm doing this in the corner and people are like, he doesn't want to interact with anybody.

196
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:20,440
Right? And this is rude. I had very, quite a few articles.

197
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:27,650
Like in a business meeting, I work with lots of vendors and dine, right?

198
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:33,370
And so people come in and such a phone down on the table and I have their attention.

199
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:38,590
And so something happens here and then I'm no longer the priority.

200
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:42,380
And that makes me feel like you're being rude, right?

201
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:46,330
And so think about this as a side psychological aspect.

202
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:53,470
The phone should never be present. If you need to make a phone call, if you need to text somebody, if you need to do something,

203
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:57,970
take it out in the hallway and the restroom and go to the restroom.

204
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:06,580
I like to do this too. And it and it'll come up. It's probably not on this side, but I like, oh, I can kill hours.

205
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:12,700
I creeped on her beforehand and she wrote this paper and she's published this word.

206
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:16,240
And this is where she gets. And I put those notes on my phone.

207
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:25,840
So before the reception, I could pull up Cathy and remember those talking points so that when I shake hands with Can you really oh my gosh,

208
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:32,649
I read your paper on like and then she is like, Yeah, maybe somebody is following me.

209
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:37,390
And it's not so much of material. You're like building those relationships, right?

210
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,830
You have to be able to have that conversation. You want to be prepared.

211
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:47,799
And so any time I go to a reception, I want to figure out who else is going to be in the room.

212
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:52,980
Right? And I know a little bit about them and if the opportunity comes up to be able.

213
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:58,400
To tell them what I know about them. Right. That you guys ever Googled yourself?

214
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:06,290
Yeah. It's pretty interesting what comes out. Right. And so that's another point I want to point out, you know,

215
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:11,030
that are you and you last Saturday night and you woke up on the line with all of those red caps.

216
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:19,910
Right. Somebody might take a picture and you're on stage 24 seven whether you want to be or not.

217
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:23,939
I was at a it was called Amazon Fashion in Chicago.

218
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:29,550
We have cameras everywhere. And you just walk in and you click on your Amazon hat in your hand.

219
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:36,080
They don't check you out. You just put stuff in your cart and then you walk through the door and it shows up on your account later.

220
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:40,440
So anywhere you go, doorbells have the little cameras on there.

221
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:46,490
And if you guys follow a tick tock, you know how many embarrassing situations have been captured on video?

222
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:56,570
So just keep that in mind. You're on stage five or seven, and so you want to represent yourself in the best possible light dress for success.

223
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:07,200
After that zoo incident. Wherever I interview that, I call up the, you know, the phone number.

224
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,600
Hey, what's the dress code there?

225
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:16,560
You know, or creep on the website, figure out what that looks like so you know how to be prepared and always dress up.

226
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:21,870
You can always dress down by taking off your jacket, losing a tie, or for women, you know,

227
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:28,110
if you have a business jacket or whatever, that you'd rather be overdressed than underdressed.

228
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:31,800
Showing up in flip, flip flops in shorts.

229
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:38,490
When everybody else is dressed up, you probably don't want to stay long and then have your business cards available.

230
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:44,669
Never present a business card at a dinner or at the table, but in a reception.

231
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:48,440
You and have a bunch of business cards and I'm going to show you all some.

232
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:54,330
I do. I used to do Late Night. You know those TV infomercials.

233
00:27:54,600 --> 00:28:01,669
Here's the accordion business card holder, and it can be run over with the truck according to the commercial.

234
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:09,750
But I like this because here's little socks in here and I can keep my business cards in a couple of spots and then collect business cards.

235
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:14,580
And if I get a business card, like, let's say touch up with Kathy and then I collect your business card,

236
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:24,549
I might write a little note about what we talked about during our conversation so that if I want to follow up with an email,

237
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:27,690
like be like, Cathy, I hope you remember me.

238
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:32,730
This is keep in mind at the reception we had a great conversation around blah blah blah at once.

239
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:36,240
One time I was at a conference and this Barchester salesman,

240
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:45,930
I was in this type of capital where I was dying with a coffee and this guy just turned out at an environment said, Hey, blah, blah, blah.

241
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:49,950
I heard you say University of Michigan. And so he ended up buying us dinner.

242
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:55,770
And of course, in Salesman Cash in a car about a week and a half after the conference.

243
00:28:55,770 --> 00:29:01,050
And I don't remember him because like there were three other 300 other vendors at that conference

244
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:06,659
that I had his business card in and that that I wrote about at his dinner at Capital Grille.

245
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:08,230
And I was like, anything.

246
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:15,450
So when he said his name and I looked at the card, I was able to connect the dots and I was like, Yes, the conference was great.

247
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:18,290
And he went without skipping a beat, right?

248
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:25,730
So I ran into a conversation and he thought we were dusty because I remember going right and it was just because I cheated on business.

249
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:35,370
So think about those opportunities where you can use props in order to remember things.

250
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:40,050
And I will say this, I'm getting old where I don't remember as well.

251
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:45,299
And so that's another reason why I do that kind of thing. Proper introductions.

252
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:49,980
Can I pick on somebody? Would you mind? Yeah, well, you come on down here.

253
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:53,970
So what's your name? Ronnie.

254
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:58,500
Ronnie? Yeah. Nice. Ronnie. My name's Keith. We're going to do this right here.

255
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:03,450
So there's five things up here I like doing.

256
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,959
If you can keep it under five things and you can remember my things, right?

257
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:14,310
So one is look them in the eye, give a firm handshake, greet them by name, say your name slowly and then smile.

258
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:18,960
You got it in the paper again. No, it doesn't have to be in that order.

259
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:23,100
Do you have to cover all of these? Oh, okay. Time. Yeah.

260
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:27,270
Okay. Got it. All right, I'll wait. Hope that's all right.

261
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:31,140
Hi there. Hi. My name's Keith. Nice to meet you. My name is Ronnie.

262
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:34,990
Ronnie. Nice to meet you. Now, I want to point out a couple of things. Ronnie is like merits.

263
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:38,990
This is like. That's right. For now. Pumping gas right now.

264
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:44,580
So you don't wanna do that. I want to see something else you don't want to do when you when you go in for the grip.

265
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:52,469
You don't want to be like that, but you want to connect this car right here, right?

266
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:58,620
So that you have a firm handshake. Because if you don't, you get this and this.

267
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:02,010
I call the face, right. And it's really kind of creepy.

268
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:07,750
And then I could do this. And then Ronnie feels like I'm the old guy from church right now.

269
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:13,530
So be thoughtful about that nice firm handshake. One or two shakes is fine.

270
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:20,100
We want to make eye contact. I like to repeat their name so that I have it clear.

271
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:26,970
Somebody introduced myself as decontaminate cut me, Pete, and then I was Pete for the rest of the night.

272
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:30,630
Right. And it could have been just some guy just saying, no, no, no.

273
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:39,010
And so there's lots of interesting names. I have a couple of student interns, one their name, CYBERCOM Locash.

274
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:50,430
Right. And so being able to hear their name and say it again and then I don't know if you've ever seen them, but there's a kid in the middle.

275
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:54,270
It was like. Right, right, right, right.

276
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:57,780
But if you say it a couple times in your conversation, you're more likely to.

277
00:31:57,990 --> 00:32:02,020
Member made. All right. I'm going to say this to you.

278
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:13,220
Culturally speaking, I'm telling you, you know, when I meet my relatives, especially the older man and my family, we kiss on both cheeks.

279
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:16,840
Now, if I had hit a brownie here, you probably would have struck me.

280
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:20,260
Right. And so it goes back to the thing about your cultural differences.

281
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:23,470
Thank you. Thank you. You can sit there.

282
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:37,060
All right? Yeah. Okay. And so if you can practice this, I know it's you're like, I got this right, but it can be embarrassing.

283
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:41,620
I was in a situation where somebody didn't have a right arm.

284
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:46,570
Right. And so I stuck on my right arm and they stuck out their left arm.

285
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:55,710
And I shook it and. Just we moved on from there and it felt natural and they felt inclusive because they didn't do that.

286
00:32:55,720 --> 00:33:01,530
Like you're missing some, you know, like, and so you want to think about people with disabilities.

287
00:33:01,530 --> 00:33:04,020
And so I'm being respectful and thoughtful about that.

288
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:10,380
You know, when COVID came and people were wearing masks, there were some people that depended on lives.

289
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:16,600
So I understand people because they're hearing my view as well.

290
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:22,540
Well, as they'd hoped it would be. And so think about those kind of situations and don't be afraid to ask,

291
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:27,350
how am I how, you know, pushing somebody's wheelchair without their permission.

292
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:31,720
That. Right. Is that's part of their body. Yeah.

293
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:40,120
And so I was in the union mission, and one day somebody in a wheelchair is coming in the door.

294
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:48,790
And he had it was all electronic. And so they used the button on the side of the door to open up the door.

295
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:54,040
And I was approaching they were coming through. And I just said, Can I help in any way I can?

296
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:56,980
They said, No, I got it. And I was like, All right, awesome. Have a great day.

297
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:02,560
And just acknowledging somebody or asking them how you might help, for example,

298
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:08,550
somebody sitting next to me in a blind, I might say, would you like help with dinner?

299
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:12,970
Your protein is at 6:00, your starches at nine.

300
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:23,409
That that sort of thing can go a long way. But don't ever do anything without offering that help in advance because people are usually

301
00:34:23,410 --> 00:34:28,150
more proficient than you understand them to be and you want to be thoughtful about that.

302
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:33,070
All right. Networking, have a must meet list. I talked about like putting it on my phone.

303
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:36,190
I used to write, like, and no cards and put them in my pocket.

304
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:41,970
Do your research ahead of time. Know who's going to be in the room or a couple of people that you might run into.

305
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:48,790
So if you have that opportunity, you can make those connections and then work the room if you know.

306
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:53,860
When I was a bartender years ago, I was probably your age when bartended.

307
00:34:54,190 --> 00:35:00,250
We did bump and run bartending, which meant like, if Kathy's bartending down there and I'm bartending down there,

308
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:06,070
we're going to wait on our people until we bump into each other and then we work our way back down.

309
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:08,650
And then that way everybody in front of us is covered.

310
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:18,369
And so my colleagues, when we went to this conference, they said, we're going to practice, bump and run networking, which means like we can tag up.

311
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:22,720
And I'm going to be like, Hey, Kathy, I met this person over there. I want you to meet them as well.

312
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:27,730
So let's connect the dots. And once I connect the two of them, then I'm going to go on.

313
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:34,690
And so Kathy and I bumped into each other, but I'm going to run the other way so that she can build relationships.

314
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:38,140
And so can I. All right. Navigating food.

315
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:43,300
Finger food. So, you know, Riley comes up, shakes my hand right beforehand.

316
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:48,930
I'm eating chicken wings, and I like and then I'm like, hey, right.

317
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:52,410
And he's like, so think about that.

318
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,980
Remember, it's not about the food.

319
00:35:54,370 --> 00:36:01,210
And if you're going to do finger food, then if you want to shake hands in his ribs, go to the restaurant, wash your hands, and then go on from there.

320
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:07,480
And then also this happens a lot and I get my drink right.

321
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:12,800
And I got a third and now I'm like, Oh, okay.

322
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:19,210
Right. So think about your choices. Do you want to drink or do you want to need to have those?

323
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:24,220
But make sure that maybe you have a cocktail table that's close by that you can

324
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:29,180
set your appetizer down because this hand should always be free for shaking.

325
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:34,000
Okay. So just keep that in mind.

326
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:47,480
Let's see. Working the room organizing group, whether nonmembers have topics, you know, like I would never be like, where do you think that guy Trump?

327
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:54,800
Right. Like, now we don't want to go there. Right. And we won't talk about things that are going to upset people or create controversy.

328
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:58,100
It could be common acquaintances, the weather.

329
00:36:58,490 --> 00:37:02,629
Think about your I don't know if you've ever heard this term before.

330
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:05,690
Elevator speech. Right. How do I introduce myself?

331
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:12,500
My name's Keith. I'm my official title is director of Sustainability and Student and Community Engagement.

332
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:17,659
And what that means is I work on sustainability initiatives not only in dining but on campus,

333
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:25,040
but I engage students and I get to work with students on class projects in getting sustainability initiatives across the finish line.

334
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:31,190
And it was less than 30 seconds, right? So think about what you're going to say and how you're going to introduce yourself.

335
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:38,930
Be a good listener, you know? Uh, do you guys get to see the football game as we can?

336
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:43,919
Have they become blue? Right. And so I will say this.

337
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:49,950
There is one play where some guy who wasn't supposed to have a football had a full body through.

338
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:59,120
And I think he was a running back. Right. And it messed Ohio State up because we did this play was that you can tell I don't watch football.

339
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:03,060
Right. But by God, I know what the score of the game is come Monday morning,

340
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:09,720
so that when everybody's standing around the water cooler, I'm going to be like, Yeah, baby, like, this was the star.

341
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:15,059
And then from there, I'm just going to be that player. That's where he caught the eye candy in the room.

342
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:19,260
Right. Like, I'm going to be a get this here and let everybody talk about the penalty flags.

343
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:22,260
Are those yellow things that they throw down or whatever it is?

344
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:28,590
Right. And so you don't have to be you don't have to dominate the conversation.

345
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:38,160
Just listen. I love gardening. I have my son graduated with his master's in AG, MSU, and his fiancee is same thing.

346
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,270
And they start talking about plants and they use these like.

347
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:47,080
A scientific up here and I'm like it back down.

348
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:53,470
I don't know what you're talking about. And so it's okay to listen, but engage in the conversation as well.

349
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:58,210
I like to find the group that's most animated. Those people are usually tenured.

350
00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:06,100
They've been around the block. Right. And they're not afraid to introduce you to the players in the room.

351
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:10,990
And so if you get there early, you can find out who those people are and hang with them.

352
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:16,480
And they're usually the ones that are like, Come here, I want to introduce you to my friend over here.

353
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:20,650
And that's how you build relationships. And then, of course, the elevator speech.

354
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:30,500
Volunteering for the invite is always a beautiful thing that always allows you to build relationships as the senior staff,

355
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:37,209
like my boss was at his last conference and I was like, Hey, I'd really like to meet these couple of people.

356
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:39,430
And he is like, Well, I know them and I awesome.

357
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:46,870
I said, I'm going to depend on you to help be the conduit to class this and more and ask open ended questions.

358
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:50,500
How are you? Fine. How was your day?

359
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:55,630
Fine. Right. Those those are not open ended questions. Tell me about your day.

360
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:59,860
What was your most challenging thing in your master's program?

361
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:06,280
Tell me something that might help me in my career aspirations.

362
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:10,300
Right. Think about those kind of open ended questions. What did you do before leaving?

363
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:13,750
Connect back with those people that you built. Those relationships.

364
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:22,570
If I. If I get in front. So I mean, I met this guy at a conference on Friday and I'm like finding a out here.

365
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:27,040
But I just wanted to say it was a pleasure talking with you, and I hope to connect with you.

366
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:32,589
Okay. All right. So he's gonna remember me that much longer, right?

367
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:41,680
Because I circled back. And so being able to do that is going to help people remember who you are.

368
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:46,650
And that's important. And then think to host fabulous party.

369
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:49,720
Kathy, thank you. Well done. And the donuts were great.

370
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:55,100
I always love when people buy local sustainable food right after the reception.

371
00:40:55,180 --> 00:41:03,370
Make note of the business cards. And then this is one piece of advice that I can give you are and you can take it.

372
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:08,650
You don't have to take it back. I think this advances anybody, anybody that much more.

373
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:14,140
Just remember remember this phrase? There's no traffic, an extra mile.

374
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:20,709
All right. So if I were to follow up with Kathy after the event and say, Kathy,

375
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:28,180
I am lonely time and I just wanted to thank you for putting on such a great event with so many people that I was able to meet.

376
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:35,080
Blah, blah, blah. You know, thank you again. But I didn't think thank you notes were such a big deal.

377
00:41:35,350 --> 00:41:43,360
And so until I started writing them for my staff and then I noticed them on the bulletin boards in the office, some of them a couple of years old.

378
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:46,090
Right. And so when you get out here,

379
00:41:46,090 --> 00:41:55,180
I got a handwritten thank you note yesterday because I presented at the U of M alumni association website like a month ago,

380
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:58,780
and I put it on my bulletin board and my dad was really nice.

381
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:07,120
Somebody took the time after our interaction to follow up and that was important to them and that was important to me.

382
00:42:07,450 --> 00:42:15,700
And so if you going anything out of my rambling on today, remember that I think, you know, can just put you above everybody else.

383
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:25,150
And that's when you're interviewing too. Like, I just chaired a search committee and I did the three candidates on a $0.01 follow up.

384
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:33,190
Thank you. And who do you think I recommended from a position right like this that somebody that's going to follow up.

385
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:37,600
So. All right.

386
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:43,200
I want to get into some more stuff somewhere and talk about dinner and how to eat with manners.

387
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:46,710
And we'll talk about bread and butter salad, entree, dessert, plus more.

388
00:42:47,850 --> 00:42:51,960
And so I'll go through this as quickly as I can because there's a lot of information.

389
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:58,650
But like I said, don't be afraid to raise your hand and go. What about, you know, the fork on the left side of the plate and blah, blah, blah?

390
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:02,340
Raise your hand and I'll be happy to answer your question.

391
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:09,030
So before me, I'll remove your hat, cell phones off, place your napkin on your lap as soon as the host does.

392
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:12,510
Wait until everyone is served before eating. Those are kind of basics.

393
00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:14,430
I want to point out something else like.

394
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:22,120
I came into the building and Kathy was gracious enough to actually meet me at the front door to make sure I got to the room.

395
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:31,239
Okay, that was beautiful. Usually when I'm presenting or I'm going to go into a situation where there's going to be a lot of people.

396
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:37,510
I'm looking at me. I like right after the lovely story and I do this.

397
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:41,080
I start at the very top and I work my way down.

398
00:43:41,830 --> 00:43:45,790
Is my hair on place? And I apologize. The wind was fierce today, so.

399
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:53,060
All right. Do my glasses have smudges on it? Is there anything hanging from my nose?

400
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:59,149
I had an apple earlier. There isn't anything stuck in between the teeth is everything that needs bind.

401
00:43:59,150 --> 00:44:04,730
Is it bind? Is everything that needs zip. And I work my way all the way down to my feet.

402
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:11,960
So I have to worry about a couple of weeks ago when you got behind the counter as I do your burgers, then I was.

403
00:44:12,870 --> 00:44:18,390
Right. And so you don't want to make those kind of memorable impressions on people.

404
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:22,979
So take the time beforehand to make sure you have all your tools in place.

405
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:27,280
And one is making sure that you. Right.

406
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:30,489
And then you look. I also snagged my little napkin here.

407
00:44:30,490 --> 00:44:39,000
In some situations, it can be hot. So you have something or, you know, like it's cold out, that sort of thing, or one of those.

408
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:42,280
And then I have my business cards, right?

409
00:44:42,550 --> 00:44:48,880
So think about how you're going to make an entrance and have all of those things in place and.

410
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:55,310
Then at the table. How many of you watched the movie Titanic?

411
00:44:57,190 --> 00:45:04,180
Okay, Marjorie. Like Jack walks into this formal dining room and he looks down and there's just silverware from [INAUDIBLE].

412
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:10,180
Right? And Molly Brown just kind of does one of these and says, start from the outside and work your way in.

413
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:17,470
And really, that's the general basic rule. And so I'm going to point that out on another side.

414
00:45:17,770 --> 00:45:23,740
But the silverware is going to indicate to us what courses are being served as well.

415
00:45:24,070 --> 00:45:28,110
You're like, Oh, my gosh, there's Four Forks on this side. Three knives over here.

416
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:32,460
There's silverware on the top. I got a bread and butter plate with a knife.

417
00:45:32,470 --> 00:45:39,700
I'm going to show you how to navigate all of that. I don't sit and tell the host does or indicates for you to sit down.

418
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:43,060
Why? Why would you wait? Anybody?

419
00:45:47,110 --> 00:45:52,839
Cases that have been. That's why it's not time to eat.

420
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:56,120
You're like they're like, Oh, look, Ronnie is really hungry.

421
00:45:56,500 --> 00:46:04,770
He's sitting down now, right? Yes, sir. Heck, yeah.

422
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:08,360
That's another reason. Here's here's another reason I'm going to throw it away.

423
00:46:09,810 --> 00:46:18,120
Let's say Kathy is the host. She may go, Hey, Keith, I want you to sit by Ronnie because Ronnie has the same interests as you do.

424
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:19,890
And I want you guys to sit together, right?

425
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:28,980
Like back in the day when my grandmother was still around, we'd have Thanksgiving at her house to be like, Oh, Keith, I want you to sit like,

426
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:36,570
you know, cousin Ginger and me and you guys haven't seen each other in years just because she's the matriarch, because she's the hostess, right?

427
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:41,970
She's going to place everybody at the table. And there may be some strategy for the host to place people.

428
00:46:42,210 --> 00:46:44,130
And so you're never going to sit down at the table.

429
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:50,090
And the other reason is, if I sit down at the table and I'm like, oh, here's what I think happened.

430
00:46:50,430 --> 00:46:58,470
And I drink, like I just contaminated this table setting, which means that if Kevin wants to move me somewhere.

431
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:06,730
Everything's got to go as one, right? And so you're not going to sit down until the host, our hostess, indicates it's okay to do so.

432
00:47:07,150 --> 00:47:12,430
And if they don't give any specific direction, then you'll figure out like I'm left handed.

433
00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:18,280
So if I were at a long table instead of a roundtable, I'd want to be at the end.

434
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:21,580
So I'm not, you know, playing elbows with somebody next to me.

435
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:26,350
And so think about those kind of considerations. Here's the table setting.

436
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:31,180
I want you guys to do this for me. And now this. I do this funny.

437
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:36,820
All right. Now, if you look at this, this looks like a B, right?

438
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:42,430
And this looks like a D and this means Brad, which is right over there.

439
00:47:42,430 --> 00:47:44,760
And this stands for a drink which is up there.

440
00:47:44,830 --> 00:47:49,840
You see that the b of the thing about this is you can do this in your lap and nobody knows you're cheating.

441
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:57,910
Okay? And so I offer that up is just one of those quick like when you sit down at the table, do this because.

442
00:47:58,970 --> 00:48:04,090
I don't know about you guys, but I love. I love the brand. Now some of my bread and butter.

443
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:09,800
And I tried this reverse psychology taking was where somebody stole my brain.

444
00:48:10,370 --> 00:48:15,440
So I stole the person next to me thinking that I could create a reverse domino effect.

445
00:48:15,650 --> 00:48:17,120
And it didn't work right.

446
00:48:17,330 --> 00:48:23,790
And so then I realized, like, I didn't know anything about etiquette when really the person next to me, I wasn't going to find the device.

447
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:29,390
Right. And so the next time somebody saw my friend on a flight, I was just a gracious guest.

448
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:38,800
Thank you, Brian. All right. So if you do this, then you can understand what your parameters are as far as the table setting goes.

449
00:48:39,130 --> 00:48:46,240
So I want to point out a couple of things out of your salad plate and salad for tends to be the smaller fork.

450
00:48:46,810 --> 00:48:51,040
If you have two forks here, you know, one is for your salad, one is for your entree.

451
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:58,210
If you have three forks, that means there's a course in there that you're not, you know,

452
00:48:58,330 --> 00:49:01,659
you don't know about, but there's a course in there that you can need another fork for.

453
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:11,800
It could be a hot fish appetizer. Sometimes I did a sin rotisserie dinner and I'm not French, so my apologies for those that practice that language.

454
00:49:12,970 --> 00:49:20,020
But it was a seven course dinner, right? And it was a cheese board, Carthage appetizer.

455
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:25,210
Then it was soup salad entree. There was a sorbet in there somewhere, a dessert.

456
00:49:25,510 --> 00:49:28,600
And so there was silver and glassware everywhere.

457
00:49:28,870 --> 00:49:35,830
And so starting from the outside and working your way in, you can understand that when somebody presents something,

458
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:39,729
you're working from the outer silverware and you're working your way in.

459
00:49:39,730 --> 00:49:44,670
And that's how some minimize like. You know, like confusion.

460
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,690
And so your bread and butter plates over there, there's a knife.

461
00:49:49,210 --> 00:49:55,350
You see that? It says dessert, fork and spoon. Sometimes there might be just a fork there and sometimes just a spoon.

462
00:49:55,800 --> 00:50:00,300
But when you hit a fork and a spoon. Yeah, baby, it's going to be good, right?

463
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:04,170
Because you need two pieces, the utensils to navigate your dessert.

464
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:08,460
And so it could be like pie with ice cream or something like that.

465
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:15,510
And so if you take the silverware by the handles, the dessert silverware about the handles,

466
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:19,530
and you pull them down to align with the rest of the silverware,

467
00:50:19,770 --> 00:50:25,560
you'll see that the spoon will align with the spoons and the fork will align with the fork.

468
00:50:25,830 --> 00:50:37,980
Okay. And then we have base plate, charger plate, and these usually stay on the table until your entree is ready to be served.

469
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:42,780
So when you first sit down your napkins there, you're going to work with your napkin.

470
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:51,090
I have a royal table setting here. I'll play around the fact that your glassware is over there as well and then your coffee.

471
00:50:52,290 --> 00:50:57,330
Any questions? I know that was like we quick. Good.

472
00:50:57,560 --> 00:51:01,090
Okay, I'm going to keep moving. BMW helps too.

473
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:05,840
So if you can't remember this, then BMW works.

474
00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:11,150
I'm going to go over some top table manners, stay seated and set upright.

475
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:17,660
I have a I told you about my son when he lived at home.

476
00:51:18,110 --> 00:51:25,670
He would eat cereal kind of like like this, you know, with a cereal box in front of you and then.

477
00:51:28,150 --> 00:51:31,580
When you eat cereal, you're usually the first thing in the morning.

478
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:35,340
So he use that. I call it the shovel technique now.

479
00:51:36,070 --> 00:51:42,190
Just like the cereal is going to come. And however, get the man out of it was just fine with me.

480
00:51:42,190 --> 00:51:45,970
And so, you know, and he be in his boxers right now.

481
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:50,020
Dude, there are so many things going wrong here.

482
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:55,820
Right? And so, like, he wasn't entertaining anybody and he could do whatever you want in his own kitchen.

483
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:59,770
So I was I was fine with that that we have.

484
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:07,180
Practice dinners. This Thursday night, it turned out to be a dinner at our own home.

485
00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:10,899
And so we would always, like, practice our etiquette.

486
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:19,780
And so there was one dinner we even decided that we were to not pretend that we were royalty.

487
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:23,410
So everybody had, you know, was like, you can make it fun.

488
00:52:23,710 --> 00:52:26,920
Y'all have friends over on the weekends like.

489
00:52:28,730 --> 00:52:33,590
Playoffs. I know your reception tips and say is wrong in practice, right?

490
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:44,060
I think when mean make it commonplace that etiquette feels warm and friendly and inviting on an inclusive that it's not scared.

491
00:52:44,690 --> 00:52:50,239
Right. And so. I want to point out a few other things.

492
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:53,690
So stay seated. Sit up straight, sit up straight.

493
00:52:53,900 --> 00:53:00,290
Don't play with your food. Like I have a daughter that, you know, she's very picky about food.

494
00:53:00,290 --> 00:53:07,580
So she just like move it around the plate to look like she's actually doing something with it other than moving it around the plate.

495
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:19,250
Don't play with your food or here's my daughter loves mashed potatoes and she loves peas, and in order for the pea is not to roll around the plate.

496
00:53:19,310 --> 00:53:22,610
She smashes them up against the mashed potatoes.

497
00:53:22,610 --> 00:53:27,950
Dad, you can't have mashed potatoes without gravy, right? And then you coming of this technique,

498
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:37,640
if you take your back to your state and create a crater and mashed potatoes and YouTube and have them out and recorded gravy into the crater.

499
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:40,990
Right. And then the peas become the people in the village.

500
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:46,610
And as you eat them, the lava overflows and kills all the people they don't pay.

501
00:53:47,510 --> 00:53:56,419
All right. And so while you may want to that feels comfortable at home, don't do that out in public, too.

502
00:53:56,420 --> 00:54:04,520
With your mouth closed, I did a lunch interview with some colleagues and this person and I I'm really bad about this.

503
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:09,469
Like somebody goes puffy in their mouth. I'm like, Huh? I'm going to ask opening question.

504
00:54:09,470 --> 00:54:19,550
Right. And so I asked a question and they answered it and food came out of their mouth and landed on one of the colleagues plate next to me.

505
00:54:19,820 --> 00:54:23,809
And I didn't notice that, but the colleague did. And then they stopped eating their food.

506
00:54:23,810 --> 00:54:28,370
So when we got up to leave, I kind of held back with my colleague and I'm like.

507
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:33,090
You know, this is your dining unit. Why did you stop eating?

508
00:54:33,090 --> 00:54:38,730
What was wrong with the food? And they were like, not nothing until food from their mouth came flying over here.

509
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,590
And so, you know,

510
00:54:41,130 --> 00:54:49,680
and you kind of they all know this like I call this the international my half of us for out just after week in the right we do one of these.

511
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:58,280
So your manager had to shoot you. And when you feel comfortable with all that, you're not going to spew anything.

512
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:04,070
Anybody that answered the question. Right. So don't don't be afraid.

513
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:06,710
And also remember that it's not about the food.

514
00:55:07,010 --> 00:55:13,370
And I've been in lunch interviews where we heard they got through the food at all because we were enthralled in the conversation.

515
00:55:13,910 --> 00:55:23,030
Don't hunch over your food. My grandmother used to have this bird that said there their face in the water and then they would pop back up like this.

516
00:55:23,030 --> 00:55:30,559
And we don't practice that technique. In fact, proper diet, you're not going to be like, Oh, I'm going in for food.

517
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:36,080
Great. And then do this and then come back up. The food comes to you, you know, go to the food.

518
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:47,060
And so if you need to adjust yourself so that you can eat properly and the food can come to your mouth and then you can set it down, that's important.

519
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:53,260
Another thing to remember is once you pick up your silverware, it doesn't go back down on the table.

520
00:55:53,270 --> 00:55:56,900
It goes on your plate because this is considered contaminated.

521
00:55:57,320 --> 00:56:00,340
It's kind of the same thing with your napkin, right?

522
00:56:00,410 --> 00:56:04,260
Once I pick it. I own all of this.

523
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:07,739
And so I'm going to do this and I'm going to set it back in my lap.

524
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:13,210
And if I need to go to the restroom, it's not going to go on the table because I don't want cross contact with the

525
00:56:13,230 --> 00:56:16,950
people on the other side of me so I can set the napkin on the back of my chair.

526
00:56:17,490 --> 00:56:21,270
Okay. And then when I come back, I'll grab the napkins, sit back down.

527
00:56:21,450 --> 00:56:28,360
Now, I've been in really nice restaurants where I went to the restroom and I came back and there was a clean napkin.

528
00:56:28,390 --> 00:56:35,190
They took the old one and I was like, Ooh, Henry, being a dining professional, I'm like, You were in an artsy fartsy place, right?

529
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:39,509
I actually walked past my table setting. And then people are like, kids here, you're over here.

530
00:56:39,510 --> 00:56:47,790
And I was like, Oh, cause I am from Manhattan, right? So I sat back down and then I was like, Hmm, I wonder how, like, you know,

531
00:56:47,790 --> 00:56:52,020
if I do this again when I get a fresh napkin, I did it three times and then.

532
00:56:53,020 --> 00:56:55,690
My colleagues said I was having issues right struggles.

533
00:56:55,690 --> 00:57:01,930
And so as I started challenging, like, am I going to get a new napkin every time I leave the table?

534
00:57:02,290 --> 00:57:07,929
So you want to go with the flow? I think about dining is Dancing with the Stars.

535
00:57:07,930 --> 00:57:15,980
There's somebody leading and somebody following. And as long as you don't have to do it backwards in heels, then you're you're doing okay, right?

536
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:20,350
So we're not going to begin until the host indicates it's okay for us to do so.

537
00:57:20,590 --> 00:57:23,860
We're not going to eat until everybody has food in front of them.

538
00:57:24,550 --> 00:57:25,830
And so we're taking cues.

539
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:35,650
If Kathy were the hostess and the server came by and Kathy requested the wine list, then the server's going to know who gets the bell.

540
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:42,320
Because I, as a guest, when asked to see the wine list, but the host or hostess said, okay.

541
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:46,810
All right. Top table manners don't make rude noises.

542
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:51,760
In some cultures, burping shows that the food was delicious, right?

543
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:58,600
In some cultures, slurping is fine or picking up the civil defense.

544
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:01,930
But remember, in American culture, it's not about the food.

545
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:06,339
I want to show you something, though. I told you, told you about the shovel technique.

546
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:12,490
And and my son was there. When you're eating something and you're using a spoon.

547
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:19,870
The spoon is going to go in to the soup or whatever eating and you're going to work your way.

548
00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:23,470
So out to see back to me to see that scene.

549
00:58:23,740 --> 00:58:31,780
And I'm going to show you why that's important. If you take your soup and you put your spoon in there and you bring it up along the back of the ball,

550
00:58:31,990 --> 00:58:41,440
you can actually write any access residue off the bottom of the spoon so that I can tell you how many times I've ruined because you do one of these.

551
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:46,630
And then there's like this like, oh, it's me. This is lovely on that beautiful side.

552
00:58:46,930 --> 00:58:51,459
And so if you do this and then across the back, then you can bring it up.

553
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:55,310
And this is something I want to. Don't do this.

554
00:58:58,130 --> 00:59:04,850
Right. You're just spewing germs all over the gym. So I actually took the spill and I raised it right here on my left.

555
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:10,040
And as if that helps me understand how nuclear heights can be.

556
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:15,290
Right, because I've had that soup where it hit your mouth and then the end of a pizza mouth.

557
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:18,800
And we don't want injuries at the dinner table.

558
00:59:19,070 --> 00:59:26,420
And so I do this and it's too hot. I can put it back in my mouth and do a quiet stir.

559
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:31,070
And the grandmother just gave us all the time. Maybe in your life.

560
00:59:32,310 --> 00:59:37,200
So that's how you navigate the suit out to sea back to me.

561
00:59:37,620 --> 00:59:43,920
And those little things can go a long way. So looks like we know what we're doing.

562
00:59:44,370 --> 00:59:49,920
Restroom visits don't need to be announced. I remember in elementary school you be like, Now, excuse me.

563
00:59:49,930 --> 00:59:54,450
I'm like, I'm holding up this one finger, and so you don't have to do that.

564
00:59:54,450 --> 00:59:58,110
Simply excuse yourself and get up and go to the restroom.

565
00:59:59,070 --> 01:00:01,139
And these things are playing Chapstick.

566
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:09,150
Cough, blow your nose, pick your teeth, do that in private, right like you and be at the table like, oh, dinner.

567
01:00:09,150 --> 01:00:17,219
My family are like my grandfather used to like look for the toothpicks at the register so he can hang a toothpick in his mouth.

568
01:00:17,220 --> 01:00:21,360
And he did this all afternoon. You're like, all right.

569
01:00:21,540 --> 01:00:31,229
So if you're going to do anything applying lipstick, whatever, blow your nose, dismiss yourself and go take care of it somewhere else.

570
01:00:31,230 --> 01:00:38,990
Now, I've been in situations where like at a table for people and I have to sneeze, right?

571
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:44,460
And I know that it's going to be the mother of all sneezes and I'm going to do some damage.

572
01:00:44,490 --> 01:00:50,550
Right. And so if you can't excuse yourself and go to the restroom,

573
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:59,360
then my suggestion is push back from the table as far as you can and turn your head and sneeze into your elbow.

574
01:01:00,060 --> 01:01:03,120
Okay. Because otherwise, what's your name? Auburn.

575
01:01:03,420 --> 01:01:09,440
Auburn. Nice. Auburn is going to think he can see it like that title, like I got to.

576
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:16,920
And then he was like, Oh, right. And so they push back and he is going to my elbow.

577
01:01:18,210 --> 01:01:21,570
I can also check for damage while I'm down, right?

578
01:01:21,570 --> 01:01:29,570
Like, okay, it's time for me to go to the restroom and now I can get up and say, excuse me and go take care of it.

579
01:01:29,610 --> 01:01:35,819
And then if I wasn't alone, okay. All right.

580
01:01:35,820 --> 01:01:39,450
Some other things come to the table with clean hands and face that goes back to that,

581
01:01:39,450 --> 01:01:42,630
where I said, go to the restroom ahead of time and do that full body check.

582
01:01:42,990 --> 01:01:46,620
I think that's important. Start eating only when everyone else does.

583
01:01:46,650 --> 01:01:52,860
Irwin Given no about the house you're going to be in situations like I've been to a wedding where like we didn't have a hostess at the table.

584
01:01:52,870 --> 01:01:57,120
So once everybody has food in front of them, then collectively you can start eating.

585
01:01:57,130 --> 01:02:04,410
You don't need somebody to go and begin. And so think about those kind of situations then napkin.

586
01:02:04,410 --> 01:02:07,770
When should I wipe my mouth before I take a drink?

587
01:02:08,250 --> 01:02:12,310
Because if I'm enjoying my brand, which I love so dearly here,

588
01:02:12,540 --> 01:02:18,989
those oils from the butter or anything leftover from the meal could be on your

589
01:02:18,990 --> 01:02:23,490
lips and you don't want floaties because neatness counts when you're eating.

590
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:30,960
And so I'm going to do one of these and then I'm going to take a drink and then I can go back to eating again.

591
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:36,090
And so it's important. And then I talked about napkin leaving it on the chair.

592
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:41,550
The only time it ever goes back on the plate is when everybody collectively gets up to leave.

593
01:02:42,090 --> 01:02:50,250
So if you're dining and you're listening to this guy present, the napkins are going to stay on your lap even if you're done.

594
01:02:50,460 --> 01:02:57,650
Finished. You okay? And then I want to talk about making the pass.

595
01:02:57,680 --> 01:03:10,049
Yes, ma'am. So you're having. Oh, I'm very glad that you get to use the restroom.

596
01:03:10,050 --> 01:03:13,320
And let's say, like, Kathy is next to me and I get, scuse me.

597
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:19,080
And she's got to move. I'm going to leave my napkin on where my daughter was.

598
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:22,350
Right? And then when I comes back, then I can pick it up. Put it on.

599
01:03:23,100 --> 01:03:28,070
Yes, sir. You're worried that. Awesome.

600
01:03:28,470 --> 01:03:35,670
Oh, wow. If I were going out again until I can't be out, then I'm going to hold my napkin and then let her leave.

601
01:03:35,670 --> 01:03:38,010
And then when I sit back down, I'll put this on my lap.

602
01:03:38,370 --> 01:03:45,599
And then when she comes back, I'm going to pick it up again so that she doesn't have to navigate by asking me about Do I have that right?

603
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:48,780
Like I'm going to keep an active in my heart. Does that make sense?

604
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:52,790
Well, I guess what if you're the one you. And let's go now.

605
01:03:52,970 --> 01:03:57,010
Yeah. So you get up, you're on the outside. If you put your hands up.

606
01:03:57,280 --> 01:04:00,910
Oh, gosh. I'm so happy. Yeah. They just look.

607
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:06,310
I can't imagine you take it on how you could not be back in that position.

608
01:04:06,650 --> 01:04:10,510
Yeah, you can put it on the back boot as well.

609
01:04:10,570 --> 01:04:13,900
So. Yeah. Yeah. It's funny. I remember.

610
01:04:15,300 --> 01:04:19,480
Take this role. You. So everything's from left to right at the table.

611
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:23,260
So when you enter your chair, you're supposed to enter to your last.

612
01:04:24,180 --> 01:04:30,659
And actually to your right. And that's so you can have the people next to you and then somebody else like one of you are in a booth and I'm like,

613
01:04:30,660 --> 01:04:36,930
Well, you can't be my client over the back of like, you know, that's where that safety and comfort comes into play.

614
01:04:37,230 --> 01:04:41,070
And so when you're in those kind of situations, do the best you can.

615
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:45,450
If I were to get up and Kathy were going to allow me to use the restroom,

616
01:04:46,590 --> 01:04:51,090
I would probably wait till she gets up on the table and then set the and back down.

617
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:56,370
If she returns first, she may try to slide in the spring afternoon.

618
01:04:56,390 --> 01:04:59,670
I don't know, but we want to make it as comfortable as possible.

619
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:04,830
I'm not going to take my I into the restroom. One, it's these sessions.

620
01:05:05,020 --> 01:05:09,810
This is going after the self-awareness, right? So good question.

621
01:05:11,260 --> 01:05:15,090
Any other questions? I just wanted to say, if you're doing it.

622
01:05:15,410 --> 01:05:19,060
I don't think you're going to be. Yeah.

623
01:05:19,210 --> 01:05:22,340
Yeah, for sure. Not as bad as you would think.

624
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:31,820
Did you have another? What?

625
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:40,670
Yeah. Well, I want to remind you this. Once you pick something up off the table, it's considered contaminated.

626
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:44,260
And so we want to be thoughtful of those sitting on either side.

627
01:05:44,630 --> 01:05:48,020
And so let's say that you have it doesn't have a cover protocol.

628
01:05:48,020 --> 01:05:53,809
And she didn't want to do it. And now she's set it on the table and that's right next to my coffee cup.

629
01:05:53,810 --> 01:06:05,810
And then like that. And so I, I talk about not putting it back on the table for those kind of reasons and so on for as much as possible.

630
01:06:08,540 --> 01:06:11,960
Okay. All right. I'm going to keep going because I got lots more.

631
01:06:12,170 --> 01:06:17,450
And if somebody would, I know you guys finish class like 12, 15, 12, 20.

632
01:06:17,870 --> 01:06:25,340
Give me a count timer or something, because I know it's in proper etiquette to be checking my phone, so.

633
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:28,540
Yes, ma'am. Okay. Awesome.

634
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:31,990
So, Sue, but I talked about Odyssey back to me.

635
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:36,970
I don't don't care, Brad. I love Brad.

636
01:06:37,870 --> 01:06:46,190
And the only time you're going to dunk Brad in your soup as it's served on your soup, so an example would be passive.

637
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:51,190
Izzo is a soup that I'm accustomed to, and sometimes that comes with like a bread stick.

638
01:06:51,190 --> 01:06:54,370
And then I'm like, Yeah, baby, it came at the breadstick. I can dunk.

639
01:06:54,690 --> 01:07:01,300
But, and, and so if you get Brad and the tiny brains out of play, don't use that to sop up.

640
01:07:01,540 --> 01:07:05,349
You know, you're like, we got great gravy today, and I'm gonna make sure.

641
01:07:05,350 --> 01:07:08,770
And he did the last time. All right? So don't don't do that either.

642
01:07:09,070 --> 01:07:18,370
And when you're eating, Brad, you're going to take your Brad and you're going to pull off a small piece and set your bread back down,

643
01:07:18,580 --> 01:07:25,240
you know, that small piece in your hand. And you're going to take your breath right now and you can take a little bit of butter in your foot.

644
01:07:25,810 --> 01:07:30,220
Oh, so was going to be a tiny little bit and in your pop that is now.

645
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:36,520
And then this goes back and you'd shoot YouTube and smile and wipe your mouth, take a drink, repeat.

646
01:07:36,820 --> 01:07:43,149
Right. That's kind of the process. Same with dinner. One or two bites at a time by song.

647
01:07:43,150 --> 01:07:47,320
You two kind of all of this chicken broth so that he didn't have to deal with the knife anymore, right?

648
01:07:47,350 --> 01:07:51,700
He'd be like, I'm going to do I'm going to go the heavy lifting and then I'll have to do to

649
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:55,240
shovel that in my mouth that you don't want to do that for a couple of reasons.

650
01:07:55,570 --> 01:08:00,790
Like we kind of bite sized pieces for babies so that the food will cool.

651
01:08:01,150 --> 01:08:05,270
And so if we cut up all of our food, it's going to get cold fairly quickly.

652
01:08:05,630 --> 01:08:15,100
And so why don't you use this every time you hold the times down to piece, then you're going to set your knife.

653
01:08:17,650 --> 01:08:25,990
This is called resting position. This is an indication to the server that we're still working on our food and remember, were fantastic.

654
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:33,400
We're going to close it after four or 5:00. And this allows the server to know that we're finished with our plate.

655
01:08:33,670 --> 01:08:45,040
And if you think about it from the standpoint, remember, left to right servers are serving to your left and they're clearing from your right.

656
01:08:45,370 --> 01:08:51,339
And so they're being able to take their not their thumb and place it on your silverware and

657
01:08:51,340 --> 01:08:59,860
pick it up like this avoids this kind of this kind of thing where you serve a music good.

658
01:09:01,540 --> 01:09:10,390
Is that right? And now you have ranch dressing all down on your shoulder because so kind of that open and close position.

659
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:21,320
Wine service. I want to talk about this really briefly. If the host or hostess offers one, then you made her take.

660
01:09:21,570 --> 01:09:26,300
Don't really, you know, sit down in a formal setting and somebody is like,

661
01:09:26,310 --> 01:09:32,630
I am an Alabama farmer I want so I can maybe drive down, look like you're a professional drinker.

662
01:09:33,260 --> 01:09:41,460
That's not interesting. And so if you're offered a beverage, think about a glass of wine, a beer, or maybe next drink and that.

663
01:09:41,750 --> 01:09:44,330
And I want to go back to the don't look like a professional drinker.

664
01:09:44,900 --> 01:09:51,440
Being a bartender, I was like, I want a golden margarita on the rocks with salt or, you know, all the Long Island iced tea,

665
01:09:51,980 --> 01:09:57,230
you know, energy, that other gin and tonic or rum and coke or something, and then want one drink?

666
01:09:58,100 --> 01:10:00,600
I worked for T.G.I. Fridays for a number of years.

667
01:10:00,620 --> 01:10:07,250
My regional manager came and took a bunch of us out to dinner, and his goal was to get sauce so that we would.

668
01:10:08,580 --> 01:10:14,520
That's right. And about the time I was like I another thing I realized I had over consumed

669
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:19,290
and I vowed to myself that after that anytime I'm with business colleagues.

670
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:24,800
One drink. Okay. And you can always switch out.

671
01:10:25,550 --> 01:10:35,030
Like, I go to receptions and I get Sprite for a little man or language in there, and it looks like I'm hanging out with the team.

672
01:10:35,570 --> 01:10:40,130
Right. And and so think about that.

673
01:10:40,310 --> 01:10:42,200
Wine service, red wine.

674
01:10:43,850 --> 01:10:52,580
You're going to have a red wine glass like this, and it's appropriate to hold it by the bowl because red wine is served room temperature.

675
01:10:52,790 --> 01:10:56,240
And I don't know if you've ever heard white wine snobs, but they're like you.

676
01:10:57,470 --> 01:11:04,240
You're going to switch wines, release the book, and, you know, do this and then make the difference.

677
01:11:05,250 --> 01:11:08,430
Like that and of course represented at the core places.

678
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:18,060
But I don't know what that's about, but the core is presented to the person that orders a line and they're feeling it to see if the fork is moist,

679
01:11:18,060 --> 01:11:22,320
which indicates that it was stored properly, which is horizontal.

680
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:33,010
Right. So many sniffing that they don't know what they. Red wine, followed by the gold white wine by the stone because it's search called.

681
01:11:33,050 --> 01:11:36,610
You don't want to ruin the flavor of the wine by heating it up.

682
01:11:36,940 --> 01:11:42,430
Same with champagne. There's bubbles and you kill the bubbles by holding them like that.

683
01:11:42,460 --> 01:11:48,730
So I understand that as well. And it's okay to say, no, I don't care for wine.

684
01:11:48,970 --> 01:11:54,340
I was there on lunch and one time and the hostess was like, Oh, you must try this wine.

685
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:57,700
And and I was like, No, I really don't care for any.

686
01:11:57,940 --> 01:12:01,549
And they're like, No, we had it on the on the yacht last summer.

687
01:12:01,550 --> 01:12:08,110
It is delicious. And you just have to try a little bit. And they went back and forth for a minute and then Romney just said, I'm in recovery.

688
01:12:10,040 --> 01:12:15,620
And it was that quiet. Right. And then lunch was kind of ruined after that.

689
01:12:15,890 --> 01:12:22,460
And so and so, if offered wine, it's okay to say no for religious reasons too.

690
01:12:22,550 --> 01:12:26,000
Like, you know, Muslim students are like, yeah, I don't do alcohol.

691
01:12:26,210 --> 01:12:30,940
And so be thoughtful about that as a host and as a guest.

692
01:12:30,980 --> 01:12:35,720
Also be thoughtful about that as well. There's the steps and wine service.

693
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:40,010
It's okay to decline. Be careful how much and what you order.

694
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:45,770
I always remember the setting. So here's some tap tricks.

695
01:12:45,980 --> 01:12:51,650
Relax. With a few minutes before the meal was small talk. I talked about what to talk about, what not to speak in.

696
01:12:51,650 --> 01:12:55,719
Low incidents, towns, you know, maybe be like, we're at a long table brining.

697
01:12:55,720 --> 01:13:01,940
How's it going, dude? Right. And you're like, now just people on either side of you pay attention to people sitting next to you.

698
01:13:02,270 --> 01:13:08,239
Ronnie and I are Dusty's now, and if we only interact with each other, everybody else at the table feels disenfranchized.

699
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:13,460
So make sure that when you're at a roundtable that you're being inclusive of everybody.

700
01:13:14,300 --> 01:13:25,400
Avoid offensive topics. Be a good listener. Don't interrupt, don't talk into you swallowed your food and don't make negative comments about food.

701
01:13:25,670 --> 01:13:29,450
If you have allergens, work with your server to navigate right.

702
01:13:29,450 --> 01:13:34,280
We don't expect, but if you're serves something you should try everything on your plate.

703
01:13:34,790 --> 01:13:43,010
So if there's something on your plate that you're allergic to explain that and work with your server, a good host is going to ask ahead of time.

704
01:13:43,250 --> 01:13:49,040
Right? I'm having a dinner party. I'd love to have you over. Do you have any special dietary restrictions I need to know about?

705
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:50,030
And then we go from there.

706
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:58,670
If you're in a restaurant, use your server to navigate so that you can partake and you don't have to play with your free to push it around.

707
01:13:59,510 --> 01:14:05,930
After the meal. There's the open and roasting is a B as you can take it away.

708
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:11,840
You have to finish everything on my plate. Absolutely not. Don't ask for a doggy bag.

709
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:18,620
And that's it's a casual affair. Like if we're going to the barbecue hot this weekend and it's just a group of us friends, then.

710
01:14:19,070 --> 01:14:24,050
Yeah, baby, but don't do that in a formal setting. My grandmother grew up in the Depression.

711
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:27,530
We take her out to dinner and just pull it out of her purse.

712
01:14:27,530 --> 01:14:31,160
Right. She. I keep having him in the bowls, and I'm like, What are you doing?

713
01:14:31,210 --> 01:14:36,620
Well, they're gonna just throw him out right in the kitchen and give me the lemons.

714
01:14:36,620 --> 01:14:39,740
Cappy and Kevin, right now, I'm just like, What?

715
01:14:42,300 --> 01:14:46,590
And so that was just part of her growing up and her generation.

716
01:14:47,250 --> 01:14:50,700
We're not going to we're not going to do that. So don't ask for doggie bags.

717
01:14:50,910 --> 01:14:55,440
I have that high end restaurant that I was in that kept replacing my name napkins.

718
01:14:55,800 --> 01:15:00,930
I didn't finish my food. They brought it in a swan. You know, I thought that was just one of those.

719
01:15:00,930 --> 01:15:06,930
Like, that's just a story. But they brought it to me. And the swan, if they bring it to you wrapped up, then you're welcome to take it.

720
01:15:06,930 --> 01:15:10,810
But you're not going to ask for it. And for God's sakes, don't take Zippy with you.

721
01:15:11,670 --> 01:15:18,600
All right? Remember the thank you and the handwritten note, and I would suggest that you do it within 24 hours.

722
01:15:18,990 --> 01:15:33,450
Handwritten. Not text, not tweeted, not email, not Instagram, not you guys get it handwritten with a pet with a pen and put a stamp on it in the mail.

723
01:15:33,660 --> 01:15:40,760
And that's going to set you apart. And good manners will open doors that the best education cannot.

724
01:15:41,150 --> 01:15:46,040
So I'm going to stop there. Do you anybody have any questions for me?

725
01:15:47,300 --> 01:15:53,250
Anything that you hoped I would cover but didn't. I know that was a lot to digest.

726
01:15:53,940 --> 01:15:57,150
I'm sorry. I'm a food guy. I've got a million of those. Yes, sir.

727
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:03,060
Those one time. I could.

728
01:16:05,310 --> 01:16:08,340
He said. I told me that I can order a salad.

729
01:16:11,620 --> 01:16:18,240
On the there. Yeah, I did this one time.

730
01:16:18,250 --> 01:16:21,760
I was in one of those kind of situations and I thought, Oh,

731
01:16:21,790 --> 01:16:26,559
I have a sandwich because that would be me trying to pick up the sandwich and all the cards fell out.

732
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:30,460
And I just kind of did one of these back on the plate and then I use a knife and fork.

733
01:16:30,790 --> 01:16:34,399
So consider that you don't want to order the pasta, right?

734
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:38,799
Because you're twirling and now you have to suck in the noodles and you're not supposed to do that.

735
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:43,990
You fight the noodles and let them volunteer for. And so think about what you're going to order.

736
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:48,160
And here are these pan lobsters.

737
01:16:48,170 --> 01:16:53,139
I'm not married to you right now. Not the most expensive and not the least expensive.

738
01:16:53,140 --> 01:17:00,640
If anybody's watched friends, there was an episode where somebody ordered soup and somebody ordered a side salad cause they were, like, short on cash.

739
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:05,350
And then when the bell came, they split the bell six ways and they were s right.

740
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:11,290
So if Kathy invited, we expect her to pay and.

741
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:18,470
It's okay to ask for recommendations, right? Cathy, you chose this restaurant, and I've never been here before.

742
01:17:18,660 --> 01:17:22,260
Any suggestions Wright mentioned who have had the BlackBerry.

743
01:17:23,130 --> 01:17:26,760
Chicken. That's quite delicious. That sounds good.

744
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:30,450
And then that gives you kind of a range to order within.

745
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:36,030
But remember, it's not about the food and whatever you do, you want to do it.

746
01:17:36,030 --> 01:17:40,090
And the. And the meat is. Good point.

747
01:17:40,530 --> 01:17:47,140
Thank you. Anybody else. So you guys, some of this is probably a review, right?

748
01:17:47,170 --> 01:17:53,170
I mean, I had parents over like my mother would smack me if I had an elbow was on the table and that sort of thing.

749
01:17:53,560 --> 01:18:01,300
But I want you to think about those things that you put you in position to present yourself in the best possible light.

750
01:18:01,750 --> 01:18:06,430
And if you follow up with a thank you card, that goes a long way.

751
01:18:06,700 --> 01:18:09,250
And being a good guest is just as important.

752
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:17,180
And so if you can navigate all that stuff on the table and still carry on meaningful conversations, then that's what.

753
01:18:18,420 --> 01:18:25,410
So I appreciate your time today. I understand my presentation with Cathy and she has my email.

754
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:28,769
I know this happens. I think I'll be done at a meeting.

755
01:18:28,770 --> 01:18:32,249
And then 3 minutes later on my way home, I'm like, Oh, here's a half.

756
01:18:32,250 --> 01:18:35,540
Another half dozen. And what I want to pass.

757
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:43,490
So don't be afraid to shoot me. Any questions? I wish you all well in the spring of this semester.

758
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:48,100
I know everybody's, like, heads down like Renae A. And so I appreciate your.

759
01:18:58,840 --> 01:19:04,210
Oh, yeah. Don't forget, we have more donuts and Cathy can deal with Enzo.

760
01:19:04,900 --> 01:19:11,650
Oh, yeah. If you guys. If anybody wants to check out the table setting, you're welcome to come down here, too.

761
01:19:11,860 --> 01:19:19,680
I just started out. It was on the screen. There's.

762
01:19:25,080 --> 01:19:28,450
You know.

763
01:19:29,170 --> 01:19:34,950
So, yeah, I've had him in there, as I recall. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

764
01:19:37,080 --> 01:19:40,200
Those are awesome.

765
01:19:45,870 --> 01:19:50,370
Hi there. You're right. That was perfect.

766
01:19:55,140 --> 01:19:58,380
To make sure.
