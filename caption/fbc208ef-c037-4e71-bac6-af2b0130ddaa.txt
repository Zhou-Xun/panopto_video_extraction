1
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:49,620
Yeah. We are not in this.

2
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:23,340
Oh. It was getting to the point.

3
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:43,310
I do think that some are afraid that she she's actually trying to and I think, oh, I know that movie.

4
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:49,450
Very loaded. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5
00:01:53,470 --> 00:02:08,230
I appreciate it. And I think that there was going to be a lot of things that city staff.

6
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:17,120
All right, folks. Let's get started. For this afternoon.

7
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:26,210
It's good to see everyone. Welcome again. As you know, assignment one is due today, so I hope all of you have submitted it.

8
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:36,200
And today we're going to spend a little bit of time working on assignments to write to see some announcements.

9
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:41,140
I met with many of you about assignments already, but not everybody.

10
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:44,150
And it looks like not everybody has signed up to meet with me.

11
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:55,450
So I request that all of you sign up for a meeting, go to the link on the slides to the calendar time slots and sign up for a meeting.

12
00:02:55,460 --> 00:03:00,410
I think there are at least several left. Tomorrow and some on Thursday.

13
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,730
Okay. And if you want to sign up again, please feel free to do so.

14
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:11,900
And we can follow up on our discussions from the last media summit to is due next week.

15
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:16,160
So I hope you guys have gotten a good start on that already and we'll spend some time

16
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:23,179
today going over Simon to in class in terms of you guys working on it in class.

17
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:27,649
And I'll try to help folks who need it. And next week is fall study break.

18
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:33,470
So there is no class. A reminder to everybody you won't meet, but your assignment is due next Tuesday.

19
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:40,520
Okay. All right. Let's do a little bit of recap on our last lecture.

20
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:46,460
We talked about several different things, including complex maps.

21
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,720
Can somebody explain to the class what a complex map is?

22
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:55,910
And some caveats of poor flight maps that we went over last time.

23
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:25,140
Yeah. They're not just the show cars or race or races by a certain area and different colors and recreation depending on the.

24
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:31,720
The category says you have a 0 to 5% change.

25
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:38,410
There's different. It shows the distribution of whatever you're continuing to learn.

26
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:52,830
Your rate is all there. Then I got the modifiable aerial unit problem, which is that like if you aggregate.

27
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:56,050
Oh, oh, sorry, I went too far. That's okay.

28
00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:01,509
There is overlaps but that. Well, I'll leave that for later.

29
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:06,560
But also just that because you have different scales.

30
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:25,640
Okay. I guess we have to evacuate the city.
