1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,860
To give comments. Yeah, films and your guys responses for today.

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:09,150
But I'm working my way through, so I will get that back to you all.

3
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:15,360
I know that fall break is coming.

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,430
I know the papers are coming in. So definitely if people have questions or just want like a console, let me know.

5
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,770
Happy to do that whenever. Not like at midnight.

6
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:36,389
But um, and I've gotten a few questions about papers that have just been kind of answering individually,

7
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,750
so I don't know that there's necessarily a theme to those.

8
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:46,800
But if anybody has paper questions, you know, I'd advise just, you know, if you haven't already get my start on it.

9
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,739
So it's not a last minute job. Um, okay.

10
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:59,160
So today what we're going to talk about is how to think about interventions.

11
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:08,430
So again, like, I know I'm always pushing intervention and that last paper, like if you're thinking about family contexts for interventions,

12
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:14,880
we've talked a lot so far about how to kind of intervene on parenting in a way.

13
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:21,450
And what I want to try to do today is sort of shift that a little bit and talk more about

14
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,359
what can we do in a family context to sort of promote different child health outcomes.

15
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:33,329
And so in many lecture, I know I talked about that word gap and then we need to the pact reading,

16
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:36,840
which I think is really interesting to get everybody's take on,

17
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:47,640
like how can we apply this to other other domains and then some of the readings this Kristen Davidson is a childhood obesity researcher

18
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:55,190
who and I like this paper because it also kind of goes through the steps of like how to figure out how to make an adaptation,

19
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:00,180
sort of an adaptive intervention, but at least gather community feedback on an intervention.

20
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:05,550
I asked, Is that incredible? Your series, which we will talk more about?

21
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:12,419
And actually I just had a whole meeting this morning about this intervention and

22
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,659
how to kind of implement it in different places and different versions of it.

23
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:20,220
So it's it's a pretty current one to know about if people are interested in parenting in this space.

24
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:27,870
And then this one, which is like Internet assisted parent training, sort of, it feels like a little bit of a dative term at this point.

25
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:33,750
But again, I think it's a good example of kind of the types of things you would think about if you're doing an intervention like that.

26
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:43,020
Okay. So let's just start by thinking and reflecting kind of on that packed intervention.

27
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:49,469
Like there are lots of different, you know, child health behaviors.

28
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:56,670
We've talked about a lot of already talked about injury prevention and obesity prevention and a little bit about mental health and behavior,

29
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:05,190
which we'll get more into. Um, and there's, we haven't actually talked that much about physical activity,

30
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:12,360
but there's a lot of interesting research going on in the area of physical activity and how to sort of again,

31
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,710
work in this family context to promote physical activity.

32
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:21,660
So if people are interested in that, I know at least some papers are looking at that.

33
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:27,959
There are colleagues over in kinesiology who are really interested in that space.

34
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:31,980
And that's I would say this is kind of a hot topic appropriately so.

35
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:37,500
Like we know kids are not as active. None of us are as active as we've been all like us to be.

36
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:45,360
And this sort of there's in my view, since I'm like such a family focused early childhood person,

37
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:51,299
it's sort of surprising to me that this hasn't been a context that's been as much of a focus.

38
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:56,130
But it's I would say like it's getting just seem like some grant proposal, you know,

39
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:00,809
calls for for money to look at like family context of early physical activity.

40
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:11,310
And I'm like, Yeah, okay, why not? Of course. So certainly also this is just like, you know, healthy eating and also mealtime routine.

41
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:15,000
I think that's clearly breakfast. That looks like a really large yummy breakfast.

42
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:20,459
Maybe it's highly caloric, I don't know. But it looks like a sort of regular routine.

43
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:25,000
And they have like got their bowls and they have like their little container for Cheerios.

44
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,569
It's like it's a very established routine in the family.

45
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:33,959
So when we're talking about most family based interventions, we're often talking about routines.

46
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:38,190
How do you establish a routine to make sure bedtime happens on time?

47
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:45,030
You know, in a in a reasonable way, meal times happen, opportunities for physical activity happen.

48
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:56,159
These two are both kind of that, you know, parenting and parenting sensitivity type of interventions.

49
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,700
So thinking about like the mom power type work. Relational health.

50
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:07,450
So, like, you know, this kid is having some emotion, regulation, stress maybe, and they're going to their parents for a hug.

51
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:10,480
So that's like a relational health kind of image.

52
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:16,780
And then here, maybe this kid's a little bit older, learning to talk about emotions and contextualize experiences,

53
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:21,309
and that can happen in a positive relational health context.

54
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:28,030
And so I would say both of these can have sort of implications for mental health and behavioral health in little kids.

55
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:36,520
And then, of course, one of the favorite examples is like healthy eating and engaging kids in nutrition and preparing food.

56
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:43,330
Then with the idea that with some research behind supporting this idea, but I would say it's a little bit mixed.

57
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:51,820
You know, kids are more likely to kids are more likely to try new foods or eat more healthy foods if they're involved in their preparation.

58
00:05:52,600 --> 00:06:00,280
And there is some research to bear that out, but it's not like a, you know, perfect solution, but it's a great thing to do.

59
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:05,440
And then it's also, I think, like long term, you build cooking skills and build like a familiarity with,

60
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:09,879
you know, the concept of creating food, which is is good.

61
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:16,360
And then of course, teeth brushing. And a lot of people noted an impact response that you could do that sort of rewarding for teeth brushing.

62
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:20,950
And that's we've talked a little bit about oral health in here, but that's certainly something that's,

63
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:26,410
you know, something that the impact type intervention would lend itself to.

64
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:30,610
Like you wouldn't need to do a find level intervention to sort of encourage teeth brushing,

65
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:33,940
but it's a great behavioral reinforcement type of behavior.

66
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:44,320
Any other thoughts from the packed intervention, particularly in comparison to, you know, some of the other ones we've talked about?

67
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:51,820
What was your take on packed reading intervention?

68
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:58,880
We have a person. Yeah.

69
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:05,570
I thought that it was way less intimidating and having like someone come in your home so it could be really good

70
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:13,520
for families or populations that don't necessarily trust people who are like professionals or academics or Yeah.

71
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:20,660
Are coming into their home to like judge them. Mhm. That could be more accessible for them, they might feel more comfortable.

72
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:25,210
I'm sorry. Yeah. And they're also connected to it through a head start.

73
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:29,930
Like a teacher. Known setting. Yeah. I'm like, oh, I liked that.

74
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:34,850
Schools were set by the parent and the child themselves.

75
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:40,220
And I think that that's like a really important aspect to the intervention,

76
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:46,670
because sometimes if an external goal is set for you, there's a lot of pressure to meet that.

77
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:52,700
So when they're able to pick a goal that's attainable for them and their family dynamic,

78
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:59,870
I think that that is way better chance for success than an external force pressuring meet the goal.

79
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:05,809
Yes, absolutely. So I think that's like really critical with PACT and just thinking through all these sort of different examples,

80
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:11,719
I just talk through like what could be a family's goal in any given any of these

81
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:16,430
areas and how do a family like that might be doing the find intervention?

82
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:25,130
Like could you establish a parenting goal for that family that's sort of in the fine, you know, that's then implemented through find.

83
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:31,999
But still getting to that parenting goal is really critical. Yeah, and I didn't like having the parenting skills.

84
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,809
I think the only barrier that I saw was just like the technology, like having to know people are also like parental timing,

85
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:47,090
like if they actually can like sit down with it and do it just like be at work or it like fall in a place and like to have to do it.

86
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:48,999
Yeah. And replace and they,

87
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:59,990
they actually have sort of like so destructively I think that that question like this picture I always kind of like to thank you.

88
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:04,310
I took a little bit of fun at this picture because it's like one of these like standard,

89
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:12,110
like parent child talking together series kind of moments and like there aren't that many moments in parenting that kind of go that way.

90
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,320
And so person's point, like a parent, you know,

91
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:21,020
even though we're trying to make it easy and hand feed and have these goals and have a dance, it's like a little dancing bear reward.

92
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:27,110
It's still going to be you have to still do the behavior right of sitting down and doing it, even if this board is there.

93
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:30,620
So there's still that sort of time management element that we have to think about.

94
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:33,979
And maybe a sibling adaptation would actually be really cool.

95
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:38,930
Like you could have a sibling kind of reading to that younger child and they could, you know, be improving their reading.

96
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:42,110
So that could be like a a tweak on the pact approach.

97
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:45,140
Yeah, I'm like, yeah, I can pull with the timing of.

98
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:54,280
It's like a fine program. I think it would be easier to think like you can do it at home, like, Oh,

99
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:59,200
we do this right before bedtime or something like that, versus like with a companion program.

100
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:05,830
Like you have to control everything around you. Like go in a light and a little bit easier.

101
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:11,740
Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, they are the high school.

102
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:14,799
Always like using a tablet and having an app to use.

103
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,460
Like, what about like, oh, what about access? Like access to the Internet?

104
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:23,530
Not every family has that. So that can also be a very good kind of symbol.

105
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:27,040
Some families out because it's benefited from this intervention.

106
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:32,109
Absolutely. Yes. So always a key issue.

107
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:39,909
And also with regard to that, in fact, Internet assisted parenting intervention, same thing like you have to have, as we all know deeply now,

108
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:48,550
like if you don't have an Internet stable connection, it's just hard to do lots of things that we now sort of take for granted a little bit.

109
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:57,520
I think one of the other things about PAX that I think somebody at least few people commented on was that,

110
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:01,420
you know, could you like be, you know, fostering more of a screen habit.

111
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:05,260
Right. Like these little kids who are learning how to read. And I think. Yes.

112
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:08,830
And this is also now the passed as a few years old when they first started it.

113
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:13,389
And I think now it's just gotten even a little bit more ubiquitous.

114
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:22,660
And so it's like that whole screen use of screen and use of digital methods to to deliver and intervene.

115
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:31,270
I think that still exists as a challenge. But it's also true that like nobody is screen naive at this point.

116
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:40,210
Unfortunately, I would say like eight or ten little kids, really young kids, like there are very few kids who are just in the US who are screen naive.

117
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:49,240
And so it's maybe instead of saying like, oh, you know, bringing screens into the picture, it is bad.

118
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:55,299
It's more like saying, well, how can we pivot to a different use of screen technology at screen time?

119
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:58,420
But it's actually just reading time and that's more valuable in that way.

120
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:07,120
But I think it's always something to like, remember, because of course that's a really appealing way to design and deliver interventions.

121
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:10,840
Um, let's see.

122
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:21,610
In terms of well, I guess one more thing about just like these different domains, one thing to note that I always like to highlight is that, again,

123
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:28,330
we've kind of spent a lot of time in this space, this sort of like parenting, sensitive parenting, emotion, regulation, that kind of thing.

124
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:34,070
And that may be enough for a lot of families to sort of like this.

125
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:41,200
Centering parenting, giving parents broad support, and then like for some families that maybe what they need,

126
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:46,270
they just need like some stress alleviation, some parenting support, some like external supports.

127
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:53,710
And then they can kind of do all these things to promote child health really specifically in ways that they value.

128
00:12:54,490 --> 00:13:01,389
Other families might really need the information also like on top of that parenting support more broadly.

129
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:07,000
And so I think that's a really interesting question and something to think about in terms of, you know,

130
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:13,000
intervention, designing and delivering and thinking about where you can sneak interventions into where kids are.

131
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:20,260
Do you need just sort of a general parenting support intervention and then like kind of going along with the parent selected goals?

132
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:25,180
What would you like to work on? Parent You know, what, what brings you here today kind of thing?

133
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:30,880
Or like I am an expert in oral health and I know how to intervene on this topic.

134
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:34,180
Can I do that with kids and families more effectively?

135
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:39,430
So it's sort of two different ways of going at it, you know, like oral health promotion, for example.

136
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:47,200
And something to think through, I think in public health were often like in that broad space,

137
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:53,320
but then sometimes we can be like in our job we're required to work on oral health.

138
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,810
And so what specifically about like that health, you know,

139
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:05,080
topic do we bring in and kind of make it a parenting goal like get parents to investigate and

140
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:09,970
that's where they need to be in like kind of mental health support behavior spaces a little more.

141
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:20,930
So I think that's something that comes up sometimes because, you know, often agencies that we may work in or go to or, you know,

142
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:27,819
find ourselves in professionally might be tasked with sort of a very specific child outcome or family

143
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:37,000
outcome and sort of how do we like wrap that up in kind of family centered practices more broadly?

144
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:44,659
Okay. And I would argue it's always possible to do that, even if your goal is like really,

145
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:49,610
really specific over here, like get more families to use bucks at the farmers market.

146
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:54,500
You can also do a lot to kind of in that space when you're working with families in any way.

147
00:14:54,530 --> 00:15:06,260
So, um, so in terms of, we talked a little bit about the pact, a little bit about that, and I talked in the mini lecture about word gap interventions.

148
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:08,420
But in general,

149
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:18,170
what do you guys think about we talked a little already about this sort of tech based piece and people talked about that in their packed responses.

150
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:24,160
What about this one? Are certain domains of behaviors are harder to change?

151
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:31,100
Thinking about these sort of samples of behavior like obesity prevention, physical activity, precursor, oral health.

152
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:44,930
Speaking of reading, what what aspects of behavior might be kind of easier to change child outcomes wise versus a little more?

153
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:49,220
I don't want to say intractable. That's a little more challenging to change.

154
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:57,710
And why do. And we can always add on a resilience kind of trauma informed frame on to that.

155
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:58,300
Yeah, great. Yeah.

156
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:06,110
That's something that I was thinking about in terms of just like the obesity prevention and like behaviors, early retargeting, never really working.

157
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:11,690
One of the things was, I think like family and friends and there's just like some.

158
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,580
A little bit of change. But just in thinking of that,

159
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:22,760
I feel like that can be like a hard behavior change given maybe the environment and context that the kids and families are living in.

160
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:30,920
So they maybe don't have necessarily like access to like a safe playground or place to even like engage in physical activity.

161
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:38,060
That can be hard to change their behavior just because it's not like the proper environment to allow that.

162
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,830
So that's something I was thinking about, right?

163
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:48,500
So like it feels like a very specific behavior, but then there's sort of specific environmental constraints on those behaviors.

164
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:53,420
One thing in a space of physical activity, again, can I'll just call out kinesiology.

165
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:59,870
Colleagues that are doing awesome work is looking at like home delivery of physical activity,

166
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:04,190
you know, mini videos and stuff, which is pretty interesting.

167
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:09,950
If we're talking about young, young kids, it's sort of hard to figure out how to make that work well.

168
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,750
So like, if your playground is unsafe or really environmentally polluted or you don't want

169
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:17,840
to spend time on your playground if you have one in the neighborhood for some,

170
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:27,590
you know, very reasonable reasons, then what do you do for serving young, young kids in sort of the case of like older kids?

171
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:30,229
We talk about physical activity in particular, you know,

172
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:35,510
specialized equipment that might be helpful or if kids need sort of additional we talked about this,

173
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:42,049
I think a little bit early on, discussion like specialized equipment for certain developmental disabilities or, you know, physical therapy.

174
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:46,520
People may not have that at home, but that's certainly important.

175
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:53,180
Also like parent preference, right. Like inclination, if it's going to all rests on the parent.

176
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:55,940
And I think physical activity I love the example of physical activity.

177
00:17:55,940 --> 00:18:00,590
Because of the one hand it seems very straightforward, like get people to move more.

178
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:07,969
But there's so many things that are going on with adults that are sort of acting against that and then of course saying,

179
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:11,210
you know, model it for your kids and have your kids do it.

180
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:16,880
You know, what are the barriers there from the adult side? So I think of some really good example.

181
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:23,630
Yeah. And you said that some of the obesity prevention programs like dietary intake.

182
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:33,590
Um, I was thinking about of this diagram, but I see like from my friends who are like parents now and it's like a couple of children like kind

183
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:40,999
of like processed food that's fresh fruits and vegetables and they're saying how like for example,

184
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,139
blueberry, you can have one blueberry or you have time and they can always have different.

185
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:52,550
One might be hard and you saw them and you see the process being usually the same day.

186
00:18:52,970 --> 00:19:00,350
So thinking about like younger children, you know, picky eaters, like I like kids and vegetables if I'm happy because of what it tastes like,

187
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:05,040
but little bit inconsistent in what they're getting at the time. Yes.

188
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:05,930
Really good point.

189
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:14,190
And if you guys remember that baby food article, I grant at the beginning, we have such an industry built around making it also for ourselves.

190
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:22,240
Right? It's like making it more delectable and perfect and processed and, like, delicious tasting because it's possible to do that, right?

191
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:28,810
Yeah. And having kids and we've grown, we've also talked about just to link it to other stuff like that particular issue.

192
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:34,570
Certainly eating behavior develops on a trajectory of developmental trajectory, of eating behavior.

193
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:37,360
And then we'll talk a little bit more about that and childhood obesity session,

194
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:45,990
but also toddler like autonomy and wanting to do things their own way and wanting things to be kind of like in an order.

195
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,170
So if like one blueberry tastes good and one is like, you know,

196
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:54,150
a little funky and like maybe even overripe or now that we're like in Michigan heading into the fall,

197
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,310
we don't have great fresh fruit, you know, all the time.

198
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:04,930
Maybe it's a little hard and not as good tasting. And so there's lots of different ways that that can interact with like toddler

199
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:10,750
developmental stage and desires that can make you negative experience unpleasant.

200
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:16,360
And then kind of if that gets into a negative kind of parent child dynamic, you know,

201
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:23,500
conflict interaction that can really stick with both the parent and the child in terms of having that food or trying that food again.

202
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:32,390
So yeah, there's a lot of child and developmental factors going into those eating focused interventions.

203
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:36,610
Absolutely. And so I spent a lot of my professional research touches.

204
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:41,139
I deeply know that. Yeah, I was just going to say, I think both of these are kind of hinting at it.

205
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:44,560
In my experience, routines are very hard to change.

206
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:52,870
And so I think like the physical activity that you're used to like something and then all of a sudden that switching that is very difficult.

207
00:20:53,170 --> 00:21:03,550
Mm hmm. Yeah. And it's like the number one thing that kind of we try to change in family interventions.

208
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:14,730
And so I think that that's. It's so critical to have like the parent buy in and like this will be meaningful to overcome the

209
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:20,880
big huge inertia factors of not wanting to change my routine and I have to see value in like,

210
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:23,549
why the heck would I go through this, you know,

211
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:33,010
battle about trying to move bedtime earlier or have my child try these additional foods or spend my limited like couch time?

212
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:40,709
I'm trying to get much closer to physical activity. So absolutely, I think that it is possible.

213
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:47,100
And that's why I think that early childhood space is really like things are shifting all

214
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:51,840
because there's so many new developmental stages like kind of coming at you all the time.

215
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:57,690
And so as a parent or family system, you are responsive to those things.

216
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:02,150
And so it's like if we can think about it like a complex systems approach, right?

217
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:08,090
Like if you can tweak one piece of the family system to get at, you know,

218
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:13,620
managing child behavior better by changing routines, then that can have kind of ripple effects through the system.

219
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:17,130
But I absolutely agree. Hard to do. Really hard to do.

220
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:24,140
And yeah, and I think for all of us, we have, you know, inertia, which is really powerful.

221
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:37,770
I feel like we've talked a fair bit in terms of the resilience and stressors outside and for a crisis point, like if you don't have access.

222
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:46,110
To sort the supports for doing these specific health behaviors that can be problematic and just raise additional challenge.

223
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:57,030
Anything else on that? What I will say, I don't know if this I don't know why it has that.

224
00:22:57,540 --> 00:23:01,740
I think I have that I'm. Wait, hold on. Have you guys seen this?

225
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:06,700
This little chit chat? This guy and he became famous.

226
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:11,820
I can also play it because I love it, but I like this example.

227
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:16,770
I don't know why it's what it is because it shows like it's on the couch.

228
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:27,210
It's like language development, promotion. It's built in to like a TV, a TV watching routine that's pleasurable for the parents.

229
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:32,580
And yet it's like a really fascinating promotion of childhood development.

230
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:40,050
So let's let me pull up that. I think this will either work in this thing if we haven't seen it.

231
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:49,170
I think it's like the video was around and then it was and then it they took it off because he became famous about talking to his kid.

232
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:55,110
And so I think this is like the news clip. Why doesn't everybody sort.

233
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:00,120
Okay. The reason is not about my poor mother. All right.

234
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:10,330
Listen, this guy is. So let me just go a little bit along here, but just so that those of us who haven't seen the video,

235
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:19,810
the original video, this is just like a home video that I screenshot.

236
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:27,760
Sorry, I'm going to be. But this is a little like a home home video that got picked up and was like viral for a little while.

237
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:34,569
And so if you've seen it, think of it like from a sort of a child development promotion promotion angle if you haven't seen it,

238
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:38,620
just like enjoy and think of it from a child and development angle.

239
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:42,010
Let me just play it quickly. You understand? Yeah.

240
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,810
Oh, yeah.

241
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:03,990
You know when we're down here, then.

242
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:08,110
Yeah. Wow.

243
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:15,230
I think we keep. They go out like.

244
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,930
Oh. Okay. So I love that so much.

245
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:31,090
Um, anything you guys notice in that, that, like we've talked about in here in terms of developmental.

246
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:36,310
Mechanisms. Yeah.

247
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:44,970
In return. And how? Like, the baby was like, I really love the way we do things with our hands.

248
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:49,030
And then the father was like, do the same thing with her, with his hands.

249
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:56,979
And we kind of try to repeat it. And there's like so much of that, like, mimicking and and clearly it's like a routine.

250
00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:00,020
It's a habit. Like they this is not the first thing they've done. That's right.

251
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:05,620
Like it's that. Developing? Yeah, I would also say, yes, they're going to turn.

252
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:12,860
I remember the video that you showed us where the kid was playing with that fake cell phone and the mom was just like, doesn't know what to do.

253
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:17,439
Well, I feel like I'm not trying to blame the mom, but the mom kind of like done that, you know,

254
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,130
pretend like they were on the phone with them being like, oh, you know,

255
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:25,420
anything even fake, having a conversation, you know, that really helps the kid.

256
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:28,960
Yeah, yeah. You can really see how a kid is like.

257
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:33,860
It's like they're sort of almost taking it for granted because that seems to happen a lot.

258
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:38,530
Right. And I also just think, like his comment when he says, like we have,

259
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:45,969
we're a lot of like I'm just like, oh, God, because it really just it's like it's connecting, right?

260
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:51,940
It's like that is relational health. Like they have this close bond and.

261
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:52,239
Yeah.

262
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:59,980
And at the same time, they're just like hanging out at home, hanging out on the couch, like watching like a, you know, like kind of a doltish TV show.

263
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:06,520
So, you know, this other, you know, so the kid be watching the show like maybe in two years would be a bad idea for the kid to watch or so.

264
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:14,799
But like it's, I think it's such a good example of just this like building in in a really doesn't take

265
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:19,990
a lot of time it's kind of something you're doing anyway and you know clearly like,

266
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:26,320
you know, this dad, I think he's like a comedian, you know? So it's like a very engaging, bubbly kind of personality person.

267
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:30,750
And that is not like the mom on the phone, in contrast. Right.

268
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:36,760
So there's like personality differences, lots of things, but it's just very clear that that's a routine that they have.

269
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:41,950
And it's not like they probably, you know, sat down to like, okay, there's our TV watching time.

270
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:42,919
We got to make sure to get it in.

271
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:48,760
And, you know, but that's probably the kind of behavior that is happening in lots of different home contexts for this kid.

272
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:57,640
And I think, you know, again, this this data that's kind of gone viral and I think his dad, like daddy is commercials or something.

273
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:01,840
So, you know, who knows how this kid is now, like impacted by all this?

274
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:09,970
But in terms of about early relationship stuff, I think it's a really good example of just very naturalistic kind of kind of behaviors.

275
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:16,569
Okay. So and it's just a fun video to illustrate that.

276
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:25,990
So I'm going to take away the error message. I think just the other thing is that the almost just the the word gap interventions.

277
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:30,010
So those, like I said, a video like they started through the Reach Out lead program,

278
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:39,999
which is pediatric clinic based and now they've sort of evolved with technology around the little like monitors that that that give you feedback

279
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:46,750
about like these are how many serve and return conversational turn interactions you've had today and like let's see if we can increase those.

280
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:55,720
And so it's kind of a those word gap interventions. And Lena is the brand of technology that's kind of been out front in this space.

281
00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:02,440
It's a good example of like melding technology in a kind of light way different from past because it's not screen,

282
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:06,850
but also picking up on this kind of natural like they would have had a huge high

283
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:13,690
score on those like Lena voice recorders compared to like the mom with the phone.

284
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:19,180
So that's the kind of thing that Lena interventions are trying to like enhance.

285
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:31,060
Okay. So thinking, thinking about these different sort of family interventions and like it does take a lot of time potentially to work with families,

286
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:37,870
connect with families. So and this is you know, this is like an open question.

287
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:44,620
And it certainly also depends on where people's comfort zone is, where people's opportunities are to reach families.

288
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:53,830
Like can you implement a kind of relationship based, relational, health focused parent, you know, training and quote unquote kind of intervention?

289
00:29:55,930 --> 00:30:01,749
But this is more parent training, sorry. This is sort of a behavioral focused intervention.

290
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:12,400
The idea of like the incredible years where you're trying to, like, really promote certain behaviors and like reduce other behaviors.

291
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:17,620
And then we've kind of been talking a little bit about routines, but like,

292
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:23,019
is your intervention going to be more sort of like family systems focused and sort of broadly,

293
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:31,780
how does your family operate and what can we do to sort of shape it around the edges to like make change in this one part of the system?

294
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:40,270
Like maybe the the parent, you know, decides I'm going to try to incorporate more physical activity in my life by,

295
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:43,960
you know, walking out after work or something.

296
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:51,100
Maybe I take my kid along with me and so they show, you know, they can you know, we can talk on the walk,

297
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:57,100
we can model the walking behavior, and we can sort of prioritize this in our day.

298
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:01,620
And then that won't necessarily because you're like take, you know, it's very basic, but like you're taking.

299
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:06,000
Time for the walk. So you're going to sort of shift time to other activities?

300
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:12,850
Definitely. And I think that these are kind of good like ways to think about where the focus of different family,

301
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:20,530
family based interventions can be and why the resilience movie kind of plays into this.

302
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:27,579
And trauma and all the things we've talked about a lot is that sometimes this can be pretty intense for families,

303
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:32,319
especially families who have experienced a lot of trauma and maybe are working through

304
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:35,770
a lot of relationship stuff or are not working through a lot of relationship stuff.

305
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:43,570
They can be potentially a lot to kind of delve into important,

306
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:52,779
but potentially like just you want to have sort of a mental health kind of backup connections for

307
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:56,890
families who are really struggling if you're doing sort of these relationship focused interventions.

308
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:03,640
Another way perhaps into families, because this is really wonderful, as I've talked about some of them,

309
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:08,770
but you have to be kind of ready to be able to engage and support a family through that kind of intervention,

310
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:10,510
this kind of intervention,

311
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:17,350
which is more of that behavioral reinforcement like reward the good behavior that you want to see more of and ignore, which is difficult.

312
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:24,009
The behaviors you don't want to see as much of this might be sort of easier for families to engage in sometimes,

313
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:31,870
like especially if it's around a specific behavior, even, you know, physical activity or eating or sleep, something like that.

314
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:40,209
A family might say, you know what, I've got a lot going on in my relationship history and I've experienced trauma

315
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:44,650
and I don't really want to get into that intense emotional space right now,

316
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:51,490
but I really want to work on sleep. And so I have the kind of emotional capacity to like work on my child's bedtime.

317
00:32:51,730 --> 00:33:00,190
And that's like a really good concrete goal. We know that involves a lot of systems change to change bedtime even like just so

318
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:04,690
for your guys information like bedtime interventions like you can change that by 20,

319
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:07,300
30 minutes. So that's like a huge effect size. Okay.

320
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:16,090
So it's like really hard to change because of all the family systems that go into bedtime, but it gives you a very concrete behavioral goal.

321
00:33:16,930 --> 00:33:21,340
And so that, you know, could be a way to think about, all right.

322
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:29,110
I'm working with the population of parents who, like, really is able to talk about behavior change in a very concrete way.

323
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:35,530
And we know some ways to do that. And we maybe don't have to go through the relationship process.

324
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:40,389
But maybe if we work on bedtime and everybody's a little bit less stressed about bedtime,

325
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:45,940
then you can kind of go back and work on relationship stuff and family system stuff.

326
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:55,180
And so I think those are all just sort of like important pieces to consider when you're talking about families.

327
00:33:55,810 --> 00:33:59,470
It's a lot of different levels of intervention, even within the family context.

328
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:08,530
And what I didn't actually put on here are like a parent mental health intervention, like a parent decides they're going to go and get therapy.

329
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:15,340
That could also, of course, have implications for all of these things, even if it's not family based interventions of what the parent.

330
00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:25,270
And the other point that I would like to make is that no matter what that kind of topic is, because,

331
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:32,410
you know, it's happening in a relationship context and it's happening in a family systems context.

332
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:41,499
They are, you know, and you're talking about one single child. Any given intervention may have kind of ripple effects on two different areas of

333
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:44,830
functioning and different areas of development and different areas of parenting.

334
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:56,620
One of the things that I would say, like in the literature, if you guys are researching this stuff, there's been more interest.

335
00:34:56,620 --> 00:35:02,680
So there's always been this sort of like family based, parent training, behavioral, you know, parent training programs.

336
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:09,310
They have not typically focused on things like health outcomes, but they've always focused on behavior,

337
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:12,700
mental health, social skills, problem solving, those kinds of outcomes.

338
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:18,520
I think there's a lot of potential for those programs to actually impact health behaviors.

339
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:27,250
And we think about like child health behaviors that things like sleep eating, physical activity, screen time, but they aren't the same.

340
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:33,370
They're increasingly measured but not always measured as sort of an outcome of those types of programs.

341
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:42,489
And I think that that's sort of an interesting area for like prompting future research and an argument for like,

342
00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:45,730
hey, if we're doing some sort of parenting program in the community,

343
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:53,590
let's see what we can measure in terms of outcomes, just to get a broad sense of like what might be changing through this parenting intervention.

344
00:35:53,590 --> 00:36:01,390
Even if we're not trying to change, you know, physical activity, we end up changing it because we've sort of tweaked this other area of the system.

345
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:13,450
Let me think. In terms of this this idea of like having a very concrete behavioral goal.

346
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:20,980
I know I have mentioned before in the childhood obesity prevention space, we've often not said,

347
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:27,910
you know, we often haven't advertised programs as obesity prevention in the preschool space,

348
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:32,470
but we have advertised things like healthy eating and physical activity because

349
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:38,680
we know to some degree that those map on to later obesity risk for kids.

350
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:47,380
But parents don't typically want to attend to obesity prevention program for preschoolers like by that name.

351
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:53,109
And so back to that idea of like, is it consistent with like parent values, parent goals,

352
00:36:53,110 --> 00:37:01,090
like we may be as researchers hoping to do obesity prevention, but from a parent perspective, that can make a program not appealing.

353
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:05,470
So it's probably said that a few times because I think that's a really important point.

354
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:16,900
Let's see. Any questions about like what those different kinds of programs, I don't know would look like or what do you guys think you would?

355
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:25,950
Due for, you know, approaching these different kinds of intervention approaches?

356
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:26,970
Yes, sir.

357
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:39,450
One thing I kind of struggle with is how the intervention defines really many different things, and that looks very different from group to group.

358
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:50,280
And so I guess just in your experience, do these interventions allow for the flexibility to be able to like use in different contexts of family?

359
00:37:51,240 --> 00:38:02,720
Great question. So I would say I'll talk about that a little bit with these two interventions we'll talk about, but 100% like that's so important.

360
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:09,540
We've talked a bit about that sort of alternate caregivers and like who's in the home but even who's outside of the home,

361
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:14,460
those can be really important, like parenting partners as well, or co-parents.

362
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:22,469
So I think any let me say that any intervention that would would be like billing itself as a family systems

363
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:30,780
kind of intervention should absolutely be including those broader swath of of parenting connected people.

364
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:34,950
Probably not all do and they've certainly not all been.

365
00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:43,320
This is a caveat like not all programs have been evaluated in different like family constellations in terms of effectiveness.

366
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:51,990
But I would also say that a family based program that doesn't include key people who maybe not in the home or who may be,

367
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:57,360
you know, in the home, but not participating in the intervention are not going to be as effective.

368
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:10,769
The only like the only sort of additional caveat to that is that sometimes if you have someone like this is in the obesity literature,

369
00:39:10,770 --> 00:39:26,099
so very stereotypically, mom is the gatekeeper of like family feeding, eating, you know, world and in that kind of family setup.

370
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:31,200
So if mom is like I'm responsible and providing the food, I'm shopping for the food,

371
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:35,760
I'm doing all the things that it takes to get the food in into the into the family.

372
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:44,070
In those circumstances, if you intervene with mom, then you can see effects.

373
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:54,900
The problem, though, is that like a child might go along to some degree with like a change in eating habits and behavior and food options.

374
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:57,750
But the other adults in the household may not.

375
00:39:58,290 --> 00:40:06,390
So there are these interventions in the obesity space called like parent has agent interventions that don't involve the child.

376
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:11,669
And that's sort of this like subset of interventions that says we just want to intervene,

377
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:18,299
like kind of with the parents to just change the environment and then the child will kind of go along.

378
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:21,990
But even in those interventions, it's helpful to have multiple parents on board.

379
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,929
But it's a really good question.

380
00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:33,750
And I feel like because definitely the obesity prevention world and many other most other parenting focused interventions have always,

381
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:40,079
you know, started with the mom. And research and all sorts of things.

382
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:42,720
So I think like co-parents in general are being left out.

383
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:50,549
There's also the defensible point to say, like, there's a lot of kids who are in, you know, single parent mom headed households.

384
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:52,530
And so that was a logical place to start.

385
00:40:53,160 --> 00:41:01,319
But even if you're in a single parent mom household, hopefully you have some additional parenting support partners in your life as the parent.

386
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:05,700
And so that those people, I would argue, should be like included in that.

387
00:41:06,450 --> 00:41:11,310
And that's again, that mom power example of like bring in your support person to the group.

388
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:20,430
So yeah, really good question and other thoughts on how one might think about these different kinds of interventions.

389
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:26,020
Yeah. I think about like with the behavior reinforcement,

390
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:32,860
I think about like if you set up a pattern of like rewarding children for good behavior, but then once they get older,

391
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:35,589
like, what if you stop rewarding them then like, I don't know,

392
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:41,079
like the problem that that sets up because you're like, I think about like, oh, like my nephews or something.

393
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:47,540
If, like, what have they got? We got 18 stickers and then they're like five and they're like, do you then like you have like, I don't know.

394
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:52,510
Yeah, a lot of that seems like the rules be very flexible because, you know, children is very complicated.

395
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:57,220
So just having like the punches. Yeah, for a lot of those I think yeah.

396
00:41:57,250 --> 00:42:01,690
Like I think those big behavior reinforcements like the logic and theory behind some of them.

397
00:42:01,690 --> 00:42:05,260
But I think like in practice they can be very complicated. Yes.

398
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:11,560
Yes. And I would say, like, that's kind of a simple sticker chart and they can like explode in lots of different directions.

399
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:18,850
And what you just mentioned done for like with the the weaning off or the transitioning away from those

400
00:42:18,850 --> 00:42:26,800
reinforcements is really an important sort of and hard thing to do sometimes and sometimes what happens like.

401
00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:34,509
So another example I don't think I even yet said but like as potty training that's a really concrete goal that a lot of families

402
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:43,360
have and so you know you think about like giving you know often Eminem's which I would argue against but like you know,

403
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:48,429
stickers are another good substitution, maybe less motivating than Eminem's for some kids.

404
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:51,969
But so you give, you know, two stickers if you go in the potty.

405
00:42:51,970 --> 00:42:54,250
But like, at what point do you stop giving two stickers?

406
00:42:55,630 --> 00:43:03,190
And often what we do is like substitute with another reward or like try to ladle on the praise of like,

407
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:07,989
gosh, you're such a good, you know, good boy, you're going pee in a party all the time.

408
00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:14,020
You don't even need those stickers, you know? And so, like I feel to that you're growing up, I mean, as reward,

409
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:20,410
you're like developmental maturity and like give you this additional like try to decouple it a little bit from the stickers,

410
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:24,850
but it's hard and that's a process. And I think the idea of like, well,

411
00:43:24,850 --> 00:43:31,120
he can't go like cold turkey away from the stickers necessarily once you've seen the behavior change that you want to see.

412
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:40,180
But you can. Also another strategy is like, you know, if you build up enough stickers, you get a bigger reward again, like within range.

413
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:46,330
And that reward can be like non material can be time on the couch with Dad to watch the show or something like that.

414
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:52,290
So it's a it's an important issue in some kids. You know, a lot of this, you know,

415
00:43:52,330 --> 00:44:01,389
people have hung out with like pediatric psychology types who work a lot on like getting kids to take really aversive medications,

416
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:04,420
for example, or like do things that are unpleasant.

417
00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:13,750
That's when the sticker sticker charts tend to be like really complex, complex, because you're really trying to reward these, like, you know,

418
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:21,400
the doing of behaviors that are more unpleasant than potty training, like checking your blood sugar or doing other, you know, kinds of things.

419
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:26,740
So you're right, it can get very complex.

420
00:44:28,450 --> 00:44:33,620
And also reading about parenting, you know, like for a parent, you know,

421
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:38,140
we've all probably at some point in our lives like tried to like track our behaviors, right?

422
00:44:39,430 --> 00:44:43,660
Either with, you know, device or off in an old school way.

423
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:50,590
And I think it's, you know, we sort of naturally shift where our goals are when we do that a little bit.

424
00:44:50,590 --> 00:44:55,840
So it's kind of that same idea. And we know that reinforcement also gets old after a while, right?

425
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:59,799
We're not going to like get up every time. I like watched us and tells us to do it.

426
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:04,900
So it's it's best these things for like a concrete,

427
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:13,870
achievable sort of short term goal or goals that you can chunk up into shorter term, um, more mini achievements.

428
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:19,870
Um. Let's see. Disagreements.

429
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:23,260
Yeah. We'll talk more about medication adherence, too, but there are some examples.

430
00:45:24,130 --> 00:45:28,090
Just enough really complicated things that people are trying to get work with kids about.

431
00:45:29,830 --> 00:45:33,420
So let me talk about these. Oh, yeah.

432
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:40,569
This is just another good, you know, to hang onto these terms, I guess, because this, again,

433
00:45:40,570 --> 00:45:47,440
relates back to those like pyramids of how intensive our interventions got so universal this time, the pyramids like this.

434
00:45:47,830 --> 00:45:53,319
But universal prevention is like for the most kids lighter touch where we can do good for the money.

435
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:59,080
That's like where public health, I think hangs out appropriately selective.

436
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:05,049
So like families with known risk factors, neighborhood opportunity, parent trauma,

437
00:46:05,050 --> 00:46:12,310
child behavior, you know, income, all sorts of things can put it kind of put families here.

438
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:19,570
This distinction is important because we'll talk more about this with child care, but like or family based interventions.

439
00:46:19,570 --> 00:46:22,360
But these, of course, take resources. They're not free.

440
00:46:22,930 --> 00:46:31,120
And so understanding kind of how we can focus on kids who really may need more is critically important.

441
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:36,609
And that's when let's talk about like the economists and like get the economists involved to say,

442
00:46:36,610 --> 00:46:41,620
like, where do we invest our resources to sort of make the biggest difference.

443
00:46:42,070 --> 00:46:48,590
And then here indicated programs serve kids who are typically this is like it's

444
00:46:48,610 --> 00:46:54,189
showing problems is when you think about indicated programs and this could be

445
00:46:54,190 --> 00:46:58,569
like the child is showing behavioral issues or we know the child has been exposed

446
00:46:58,570 --> 00:47:02,440
to trauma and so you're anticipating they might have adjustment problems.

447
00:47:04,270 --> 00:47:08,710
And so, again, that's just the sort of that that triangle on those terms come up a fair bit.

448
00:47:10,090 --> 00:47:18,159
Okay. And kind of along the lines of our discussion a little bit is this piece about parent engagement.

449
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:24,370
So like we could maybe engage parents in like a light intervention more easily because it's a lower lift for parents.

450
00:47:25,090 --> 00:47:33,490
But parents of these kids might be more motivated to engage in an intervention because they see the kind of value that to like the,

451
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:37,330
you know, what's the parent's goal for being involved with us at all?

452
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:42,580
Okay. Okay.

453
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:49,690
So let me talk a little bit about two different parenting programs.

454
00:47:50,410 --> 00:47:51,670
And so one is incredible.

455
00:47:51,670 --> 00:47:59,620
Your series, which I've talked a little bit about and is a big app and call it I have done this one of many lectures I don't remember,

456
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:06,430
but like it's like the Cadillac of parent intervention programs and that's the Webster strap and reading.

457
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:10,930
She's the person who developed this program and she's since like it's it's a big

458
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:18,009
business it's like a whole industry basically the incredible your series and to some

459
00:48:18,010 --> 00:48:23,319
level appropriately because it really showed strong impact on these sort of intractable

460
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:27,250
behavior problems for kids who are really doing a lot of aggressive behavior.

461
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:31,209
And they did a really careful research on incredible years,

462
00:48:31,210 --> 00:48:40,420
which is great because they were able to look at how different components of the program impacted child behavior outcomes.

463
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:47,260
It was very carefully evaluated and built a lot of evidence behind it, strengthening families programs.

464
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:59,499
So this is like a behavioral parent training program. It is it's it's reasonably strengths based, but it's also kind of deficit focused.

465
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:05,140
So I'll talk through what that means a little bit, but it's basically trying to, you know,

466
00:49:05,290 --> 00:49:10,959
do behavioral reinforcement in lots of different ways around parenting behaviors and really trying to get parenting behaviors.

467
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:19,330
To a certain point, the Strengthening Families Program does use some of these same techniques, but it's much more of a like family centered program.

468
00:49:19,330 --> 00:49:25,719
And they actually put specific value on kind of personal question, like, who is in your family?

469
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:31,330
How is your family defined and what is the family kind of set of goals and systems?

470
00:49:31,330 --> 00:49:35,260
So this is very parent child dyad and this is very family focused.

471
00:49:36,250 --> 00:49:41,080
So I'll just kind of talk through like the the rationale for both of those.

472
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:51,729
So here's incredible years. It's actually taken off in a lot of different countries even, and they find similar results, which is pretty impressive.

473
00:49:51,730 --> 00:49:54,670
Or think about what we're talking about like parenting and behavior problems

474
00:49:54,670 --> 00:50:04,360
like those are could be broad what they do and I think in a in a good way,

475
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:11,830
they are really attentive to training and training all their interventionists really, really well.

476
00:50:13,540 --> 00:50:18,880
Unfortunately, to do that, it costs a lot to get trained. And so it's prohibitive.

477
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:28,090
I think financially and just sort of burden wise for a lot of like schools or agencies or people who might want to implement incredible years.

478
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:38,349
Incredible years does focus to some degree on relationship, but I would not call it a relationship focused program like it sort of you know,

479
00:50:38,350 --> 00:50:42,010
it talks about how parent child relationships are important and how to make them better,

480
00:50:42,610 --> 00:50:47,200
but it's not really kind of delving into like trauma focus or anything like that.

481
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:52,890
It doesn't also quite prioritize family system.

482
00:50:52,900 --> 00:51:01,570
It really sort of focuses in on one parent. One of the things that incredible years does that's great is that it does go across settings.

483
00:51:01,570 --> 00:51:09,700
So they have developed and versions of the incredible years for parent focused training, for teacher focused training,

484
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:24,670
and then even for like administrators of a school or of a preschool back to that universal selective or selected or indicated parent training basic,

485
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:30,760
which you guys will see in a second, is like not that basic, but that's the sort of universal parent training idea.

486
00:51:31,180 --> 00:51:39,330
Selective or indicated or advanced parent training. Like I said, it's kind of like a hole.

487
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:49,380
It's a it is literally a whole business. But I think it is appropriately like.

488
00:51:51,490 --> 00:51:56,530
Touting its effectiveness because it is effective.

489
00:51:57,250 --> 00:52:05,560
But I think one of the reasons that its effectiveness has got so much sort of to invest in in order to implement it as approved.

490
00:52:07,450 --> 00:52:12,909
Okay. So this is kind of the model. This is like should look like a logic model to those of us in public health.

491
00:52:12,910 --> 00:52:16,900
We've probably hopefully worked with some of these or will be in the future.

492
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:24,580
So this is incredible because like I said, that these different components and so there's this parent program, which is kind of what I'm focusing on.

493
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:31,089
We'll talk a little bit more and other sessions, I think about the child program and then there's the teacher program,

494
00:52:31,090 --> 00:52:35,050
and that's also the one that includes administrators who are going to do incredible years in their school,

495
00:52:35,740 --> 00:52:38,770
the teachers and in those years administrators go through that program.

496
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:44,870
And really the goal here is like decreased risk factors, increased protective factors kind of in each of these domains.

497
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:49,740
So in the child program, for example, it's like 62 lessons.

498
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:56,020
It's a lot. It kind of takes over the school year. And so you really need to structure your preschool classroom around it.

499
00:52:56,020 --> 00:53:02,110
If you're going to do the Incredible Years Parent Program, I believe it's 14 sessions and to have it in the next slide.

500
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:05,210
And so here are the outcomes that they look at.

501
00:53:05,230 --> 00:53:12,310
Notice there's no health outcomes there at all in terms of, you know, the health outcomes we were just talking about.

502
00:53:12,670 --> 00:53:17,740
But I would argue that if you're working to improve these things,

503
00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:25,780
I think that it's very likely you could either sneak in some health content or you will

504
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:31,540
be improving certain health outcomes just by virtue of kind of improving these things.

505
00:53:33,430 --> 00:53:38,200
What incredible years is looked at long term in terms of evaluation are on the far side.

506
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:45,880
So you see they're all kind of in the social, emotional, behavioral domain. But I think we could all agree those are important outcomes to look at.

507
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:53,620
And so, again, that's why it's the behemoth Cadillac of programs, because it does all this impressive work.

508
00:53:55,030 --> 00:54:02,860
So the basic philosophy, I said it's not very relationship focused and it's not as relationship focused as like a manpower.

509
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:06,370
But it certainly does say here, parents,

510
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:13,390
the goal here is to build this positive relationship before we talk about like the hot button issues of discipline.

511
00:54:15,370 --> 00:54:21,790
This is this there's again because it's a business have a lot of these different graphics they don't actually particularly love this graphic.

512
00:54:21,790 --> 00:54:26,590
I think it's like a little you know, it's older, so they might have an updated triangle at this point.

513
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:32,709
But these ideas are like the things that parents should be doing.

514
00:54:32,710 --> 00:54:38,680
And there's a whole unit like you focused for like two weeks on play and sort of why play is important.

515
00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:43,480
So you can see why it's a dense program because you're doing all these things.

516
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:48,090
And if you think about the kid on the dad on the couch, they were talking, they were listening.

517
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:49,300
They weren't problem solving.

518
00:54:49,990 --> 00:54:56,020
Maybe, you know, it could have been a play, but it's certainly attention and involvement and like a lot of, I would say empathy building.

519
00:54:56,050 --> 00:54:59,590
So they're talking about like the characters on the show and like, oh, yeah, I don't think you should've done that.

520
00:54:59,590 --> 00:55:06,070
You know, like there's all those sort of opportunities. So they're really, it's like that investment time and incredible years.

521
00:55:06,850 --> 00:55:10,959
What you talk about sometimes it's like you're putting pennies in your piggybank to like

522
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:16,210
invest for future when you have to do these things like give consequences for bad behavior.

523
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:22,870
So like if you have a positive relationship to build on and all these shared experiences, then you go through these things.

524
00:55:22,870 --> 00:55:32,440
Then when it comes to my parents, my parents, my child, just like, you know, threw some whatever, threw the soup on the floor in the kitchen.

525
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:39,099
They have to have a consequence for that. And so you're drawing out of your piggybank all those pennies that you put in in order to,

526
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:43,720
like, get the consequence and maintain the relationship and sort of that.

527
00:55:44,820 --> 00:55:49,190
Space of incredible years. And this is.

528
00:55:49,290 --> 00:55:54,810
Okay. So it's a 14 week curriculum, which is like this is a 13 week semester.

529
00:55:55,650 --> 00:56:02,010
You know what I mean? Like, it's a hefty curriculum and this is usually like group based.

530
00:56:03,030 --> 00:56:05,520
So even just thinking on the implementation side,

531
00:56:05,610 --> 00:56:12,030
those of us who have ever tried to get people to participate in a group of anything like a one night,

532
00:56:12,090 --> 00:56:15,000
you know, presentation at a school or something like that,

533
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:22,200
to get a group of people to participate for 14 weeks and like a 1 to 2 hour meeting, usually in the evening,

534
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:29,060
sometimes during the day or child's preschool, like the logistics of that are overwhelming, the difficult.

535
00:56:29,070 --> 00:56:33,510
And so you can see why it takes a lot to implement this.

536
00:56:34,350 --> 00:56:40,290
This is like a small sampling of the sort of materials that you need to implement it.

537
00:56:40,290 --> 00:56:43,109
And there's a book and a manual and there's a lot of material.

538
00:56:43,110 --> 00:56:48,899
And again, it's all pretty awesome in terms of behavioral reinforcement parenting strategies.

539
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:52,640
It's kind of the best, but it's a lot.

540
00:56:52,650 --> 00:57:02,340
And so I think that thinking about translating this to other spaces and kind of boiling down key messages of it is an important goal.

541
00:57:03,810 --> 00:57:08,210
Um, I will just say, I,

542
00:57:10,470 --> 00:57:18,390
I was talking with someone this morning about how they had used some of the ideas curriculum kind

543
00:57:18,390 --> 00:57:25,050
of boiled down those key points on the pyramid and done training of like pediatric residents,

544
00:57:25,350 --> 00:57:36,749
Head Start teachers and some parents and social workers to just kind of get, you know, like maybe the mindset of incredible years.

545
00:57:36,750 --> 00:57:43,229
But without doing the program, I think something like that is awesome and exciting because you can kind of infuse

546
00:57:43,230 --> 00:57:46,860
this understanding of what it takes to kind of change child's and parent behavior.

547
00:57:47,730 --> 00:57:54,090
But without going through this huge program and I think the question is like, can that work and what are the impacts of that?

548
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:59,220
So that's another direction for this work. I think I mentioned this.

549
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:06,059
I was is going to be really great format parents and an a leader who's experienced and that can be really powerful for like

550
00:58:06,060 --> 00:58:13,110
group you know hearing about each other's experience some didactic surrounded on the milestones is sort of like what I've done.

551
00:58:13,110 --> 00:58:17,980
And that like early childhood happens like this and this is what they can do and this is what we can expect them to do.

552
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:26,670
Like an example is like, you know, do you expect your toddler to like pick up and put their shoes away and like some parents,

553
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:30,749
like, absolutely, that needs to happen. Otherwise I'll have shoes all over my floor.

554
00:58:30,750 --> 00:58:36,090
And so you work with parents about like, okay, if that's your goal, how can we get toddlers to do it?

555
00:58:36,090 --> 00:58:38,370
And so, you know, could you have a basket of shoes, you know,

556
00:58:38,370 --> 00:58:44,729
but they're not going to like line them up carefully by the door reviewing videotape vignettes.

557
00:58:44,730 --> 00:58:52,200
So there's a lot of these vignettes. People might have even seen them in various ways, but this developed a long time ago.

558
00:58:52,200 --> 00:59:01,349
A lot of these vignettes are like olds, and some of them are like from the early eighties families in Oregon.

559
00:59:01,350 --> 00:59:05,700
They're all the way that a lot of them look like very hippie kind of vibe.

560
00:59:06,660 --> 00:59:15,569
So as you can imagine, like some of these vignettes are like they're sort of don't sit right a few cool.

561
00:59:15,570 --> 00:59:21,299
I would say programs have redone some of these vignettes to like update them and that is an ongoing process.

562
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:25,260
But the original vignettes are these very dated ones.

563
00:59:26,070 --> 00:59:29,820
They present good scenarios that still come up for parents all the time.

564
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:37,170
But that's a key issue and that's a key issue like if you take taken materials and methods or like,

565
00:59:37,590 --> 00:59:43,620
you know, think about implementation of materials, like your materials really matter and interventions.

566
00:59:43,620 --> 00:59:49,949
And so parents, teachers who are going to work with really care and really respond to your materials.

567
00:59:49,950 --> 00:59:52,890
So it's really important to kind of put effort into that.

568
00:59:53,970 --> 00:59:59,600
Another thing that happens in these groups are role plays and discussions like the vignette happens, kid refuses to go to bed.

569
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:05,639
Then you like, you know, do this whole like one, two, three action thing and you play out the scenario and,

570
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:09,870
you know, kind of in the group discussion, I've mentioned some of the logistics here,

571
01:00:09,870 --> 01:00:15,120
extensive training, um, always child care and transportation and meals provided,

572
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:18,320
but it still doesn't solve the problem and then the program is costly. Okay.

573
01:00:18,330 --> 01:00:24,630
So I like to spend a fair bit of time talking about incredible years because it is sort of this

574
01:00:25,020 --> 01:00:29,280
Cadillac of programs and there's different offshoots of it that have been used for different things.

575
01:00:30,870 --> 01:00:40,620
Okay. So strengthening families, different kind of program, still focused on like parenting behavior,

576
01:00:40,620 --> 01:00:44,070
child behavior, aggressive kids, like developed out of the same.

577
01:00:44,260 --> 01:00:51,440
Is much more directly family focused and also developed for families with substance abusing parents.

578
01:00:52,090 --> 01:00:57,219
And so I think that that's partly why it's a little more flexible and it's a

579
01:00:57,220 --> 01:01:01,450
little more focused on my career support people in your life as a family system.

580
01:01:04,030 --> 01:01:12,610
And then I've mentioned my whole family focus. Strengthening Families is also a cool program because they've actually developed

581
01:01:13,150 --> 01:01:18,580
different cultural variations on the program because through careful work.

582
01:01:18,580 --> 01:01:26,920
So they've done different adaptations of the program in tribal contexts, different languages,

583
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:31,960
and they really think carefully about the adaptation of the programs for the families that they're working with.

584
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:37,270
We talked about routines, and the routines are certainly an important piece.

585
01:01:37,270 --> 01:01:44,380
And so here one big thing that strengthen families is that they have a weekly family meeting and they ask you to kind of review like,

586
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:50,350
what's our family plan for this week? How did last week go? So you have that review process and how things are going.

587
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:57,610
What plan can we make for going forward? And you do it as a family meeting and it's very specific about that language.

588
01:01:59,650 --> 01:02:03,670
There's also multiple groups. There's a parenting group, there's a child group.

589
01:02:03,670 --> 01:02:08,469
And then what you do when you're administering or implementing strengthening families is that you

590
01:02:08,470 --> 01:02:12,880
have the parent and child group and then you bring them together usually for a meal makes sense.

591
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:19,360
And then you have that opportunity to practice and then you do kind of like find life a little bit, but go around and be like,

592
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:24,099
okay, as you're discussing your family plan and like sometimes they do a little problem solving activity together.

593
01:02:24,100 --> 01:02:31,270
So you can kind of comment on family dynamics very purposely, but it's a lot more,

594
01:02:31,510 --> 01:02:36,459
I think family like it's a little bit lighter than in criminal years.

595
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:42,460
It's a little more family engaging. Okay.

596
01:02:43,270 --> 01:02:48,820
And that's like less. I'm happy to talk to people interested in this program more about that.

597
01:02:50,860 --> 01:02:59,260
Okay. Also evidence based. I want to make sure I say that. Okay, so have a few more minutes.

598
01:02:59,290 --> 01:03:06,339
I think I'm thinking about how we apply these family interventions also to different health outcomes.

599
01:03:06,340 --> 01:03:11,650
I mentioned chronic illness a little bit, but what we know is that, you know,

600
01:03:11,770 --> 01:03:17,080
any family living with a chronic illness can in parent or child can stress the family system.

601
01:03:18,580 --> 01:03:28,479
And so one important area, especially for those of us who are like working with populations who have or are experiencing chronic illness,

602
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:30,610
again, is either in the family or the parent.

603
01:03:30,610 --> 01:03:41,200
But in the child of the parent, there are these sort of family focused interventions that can bring in these very specific kind of health goals,

604
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:47,440
medication management type goals. And so that's an area of research.

605
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:51,550
And I think innovation that's been really important.

606
01:03:52,180 --> 01:03:56,500
And it's sort of a like a small like pediatrics psych type focused area.

607
01:03:57,130 --> 01:04:00,490
But I think there's a lot of really good and careful research in that space.

608
01:04:00,490 --> 01:04:04,180
And I know some people are doing papers related to these areas.

609
01:04:04,180 --> 01:04:09,219
So this is kind of back to that parent engagement point, right?

610
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:11,320
So if you're if you're responding, you're like,

611
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:21,520
I think the challenge for people and working in in that like family based programing for prevention is that if you don't have a motivating issue like.

612
01:04:22,450 --> 01:04:27,850
Illness, child behavior, parent depression, whatever it is not that the person is motivating, but you know what I mean.

613
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:34,930
How do you get families to engage? And so I think there's that balance that we always want to think about.

614
01:04:35,020 --> 01:04:40,120
And I think that this space that people are interested in going in this direction, working with chronic illness populations,

615
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:47,590
there's some good work you can draw on from the family systems intervention space.

616
01:04:50,770 --> 01:04:57,879
The other thing that we know and there's like finally a few studies that have actually shown this which believe me,

617
01:04:57,880 --> 01:05:03,490
like I'm always shocked like that you can't find like a reference to say parents don't engage

618
01:05:03,490 --> 01:05:07,389
in interventions because this and it's because often people like don't measure stuff,

619
01:05:07,390 --> 01:05:10,300
don't link it to how engaged families are in interventions.

620
01:05:10,810 --> 01:05:21,700
So this is a cool study that just came out asking, gosh, are parents who, you know, have less money and less education,

621
01:05:22,870 --> 01:05:27,730
more engaged, lower and lower engagement in parenting interventions like yes, they do.

622
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:33,970
And it's a very sort of, in my view, having ever tried, you know, people have ever tried to do this.

623
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:37,270
Like it's really, really an important, critical point.

624
01:05:37,270 --> 01:05:42,520
And it's why sometimes the literature is mixed on intervention effectiveness,

625
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:49,870
because engagement is so important and yet people don't really document what's

626
01:05:49,870 --> 01:05:52,930
affecting engagement and how we can like push that around and hopefully push it up.

627
01:05:54,490 --> 01:05:58,990
And so this was a pretty clear this is just a review.

628
01:05:59,980 --> 01:06:04,840
But yeah, like all these indicators were associated with a reduction in attendance,

629
01:06:04,990 --> 01:06:09,370
a lower educational level, resulting in nearly 20% reduction in attendance.

630
01:06:10,810 --> 01:06:17,980
And I think that that it's like critically important for anybody who's wanting to engage any family in any interventions to think about this.

631
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:23,590
So posed with that.

632
01:06:25,780 --> 01:06:32,470
What do you guys think might be some ways to make that better work on that issue?

633
01:06:33,580 --> 01:06:41,270
What would be some suggestions? There's no particular answer to this.

634
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:47,190
And the piece, I mean,

635
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:53,739
focused on like the inclusion of like parents and stuff being like in the planning and implement like throughout the whole process.

636
01:06:53,740 --> 01:06:57,190
And I think that's of course going to be like encouraged by it because they're like more

637
01:06:57,190 --> 01:07:02,050
investment in like seeing the effects and the impacts of that program working out.

638
01:07:02,740 --> 01:07:05,200
So I think that might be a way to like encouraging you to it.

639
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:12,249
But we're also thinking about like socioeconomic factors that like also could be more tricky, like who's going to have the time to be invested.

640
01:07:12,250 --> 01:07:14,770
So I think like they later on, but I think yeah,

641
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:21,640
like having more involvement in the program can help encourage engagement because under like more invested in seeing the program succeed.

642
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:27,890
So that value of what we're doing. Why are we doing this? For sure?

643
01:07:27,980 --> 01:07:31,340
Yeah. I feel like offering other incentives.

644
01:07:31,340 --> 01:07:33,680
Like if you're going to have a program during dinner time,

645
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:38,930
like it would be nice to offer food or if you're going to have them come to a place that's not within their community,

646
01:07:38,930 --> 01:07:46,760
like offering Uber or some type of transportation assistance so that you're not burdening them even more by having them come to a program.

647
01:07:47,390 --> 01:07:48,170
Absolutely.

648
01:07:48,260 --> 01:07:58,129
And child care, if they need you know, they need to bring to the program or a voucher or something that to pay a babysitter to come to the program.

649
01:07:58,130 --> 01:08:03,440
Absolutely. That's really important as well. Um, let's see, Carly or something.

650
01:08:03,860 --> 01:08:11,599
Yeah. I was going to say, like how the other interaction we talked about provided meals to for that practice and motivating if

651
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:16,010
they can have some other incentive like that that they may struggle have outside of the interaction.

652
01:08:16,370 --> 01:08:19,579
Absolutely. And also, a lot of you know, again,

653
01:08:19,580 --> 01:08:26,780
those of us who've tried to do this in research contexts we offer this is sort of debatable like in the psychiatry world.

654
01:08:26,780 --> 01:08:34,850
But I would say, like we offer families incentives to come and attend our interventions and we offer, you know, money.

655
01:08:35,930 --> 01:08:40,790
And is there a way we can think about building into it into as an intervention costs, you know,

656
01:08:40,910 --> 01:08:46,129
some way to offset beyond even coming to the cost of the intervention like sort of child care,

657
01:08:46,130 --> 01:08:51,020
food and transportation, but some other kind of incentive that would be like helpful in life.

658
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:54,620
Like gas cards used to be sort of one of the things that we did.

659
01:08:56,060 --> 01:09:04,219
And are there ways that we can kind of support families so to like free them up to attend beyond sort

660
01:09:04,220 --> 01:09:08,630
of the immediate needs of what they would need to be doing in order to get to the intervention.

661
01:09:09,350 --> 01:09:18,040
Um, another idea here is also like placing the intervention in a space where families are kind of passing through.

662
01:09:18,050 --> 01:09:22,340
So that idea of school based intervention or pediatric clinic based interventions,

663
01:09:22,340 --> 01:09:25,910
and again, that's a specific space and families have to pass through.

664
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:32,989
But that's an important piece around where you locate interventions and certainly community based centers.

665
01:09:32,990 --> 01:09:36,379
And if it's a really intensive intervention, like incredible years,

666
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:42,980
like you can't do that in a library if it's a light touch parenting intervention about like hey, pre, you know,

667
01:09:42,980 --> 01:09:47,059
pregnant moms like here's some information like you can do that at the library so like

668
01:09:47,060 --> 01:09:52,340
that and again that's back to that idea of like matching your intervention intensity with,

669
01:09:52,660 --> 01:09:56,220
you know, you know, engaging, engaging people.

670
01:09:56,240 --> 01:10:01,850
Another thing you could do in the library is like figure out resources for families who are struggling

671
01:10:01,850 --> 01:10:06,940
and who need housing help and have somebody there in a library and also talk about parenting.

672
01:10:08,990 --> 01:10:13,700
So there's a lot of, I think, different ways that we can think about that.

673
01:10:13,700 --> 01:10:15,860
But this is so critical to keep in mind.

674
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:24,169
I think another thing that hasn't quite come up but has definitely come up before is having people from that parents community.

675
01:10:24,170 --> 01:10:30,500
So not only involved in the creation of the intervention or the identification of the issue or it needs assessment,

676
01:10:31,430 --> 01:10:37,370
but also who's delivering the intervention? Like I'm like I go deliver the intervention, you know,

677
01:10:37,370 --> 01:10:44,140
and be effective as nearly as effective of somebody from the community that I'd be working with or on behalf of.

678
01:10:44,150 --> 01:10:46,910
So I think that's another critical piece like Who's the Interventionist?

679
01:10:47,990 --> 01:10:53,209
And that's another reason I harp on incredible years because it's so expensive.

680
01:10:53,210 --> 01:10:57,380
It's like thousands and thousands of dollars to get trained to do incredible years.

681
01:10:57,380 --> 01:11:05,360
And so if you're like an agency head who's deciding like what kind of intervention do we want to like put in

682
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:11,870
place kind of across our agency to support the families that we see who are going to be the interventionists?

683
01:11:12,020 --> 01:11:12,979
You know, what is their like?

684
01:11:12,980 --> 01:11:22,550
Linguistic and cultural competency is how am I going to, you know, pay and train and retains interventionists and where are they going to be from?

685
01:11:23,090 --> 01:11:24,620
How are they going to connect with families?

686
01:11:25,130 --> 01:11:33,950
So all of those sort of decisions are things that, you know, depending on everybody's future career, but like you might be in the position of making.

687
01:11:33,950 --> 01:11:42,139
And so weighing like the intensity, the effectiveness, the, you know, likelihood of families to engage in the intervention.

688
01:11:42,140 --> 01:11:46,430
It's really important to kind of think through and again, like in your intervention papers,

689
01:11:46,430 --> 01:11:52,310
you're not going to go there, but like you can reflect on those things if you're recommending an intervention.

690
01:11:54,410 --> 01:11:59,510
Okay, I think. This probably summarizes what we talked about.

691
01:11:59,870 --> 01:12:02,659
So I think in terms of like summarizing these challenges,

692
01:12:02,660 --> 01:12:07,880
so this idea of like it's hard to motivate parents to attend to certainly if nothing's nothing's wrong.

693
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:12,590
And if we're in the business of prevention, it's like a it's a research design question.

694
01:12:12,590 --> 01:12:17,930
Like it's really hard to show impact of something not happening, right?

695
01:12:17,930 --> 01:12:26,030
It's hard to show impact that like kids didn't engage in drug use ten years later when they got an intervention when they were three years old.

696
01:12:26,360 --> 01:12:31,700
That's a difficult research, you know, proposition, but it's kind of what we're trying to do.

697
01:12:34,130 --> 01:12:37,520
And then this question about like, is motivation higher if problems are emerging?

698
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:46,390
And we also know and this is true for so many health behavior interventions, right?

699
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:51,110
Like we can increase knowledge, but, you know, behavior practices are harder to change.

700
01:12:51,110 --> 01:13:00,860
And so how do we get ahead of that? I think in the parenting space, there is a lot of knowledge that can be helpful and illuminating.

701
01:13:00,860 --> 01:13:08,929
And that's it's kind of nice in some ways. It's like a little bit of low hanging fruit in terms of educating people at these critical times.

702
01:13:08,930 --> 01:13:15,499
And like prenatal is one of those critical times because people are interested in learning information and like, how do you feed good information?

703
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:18,350
So that's one thing that is sort of positive.

704
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:27,530
The other thing is that it's interventions, family based interventions more effective and the whole family is engaged like those of family systems.

705
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:33,739
I mentioned this like sort of parent parent only or parent as agent and intervention

706
01:13:33,740 --> 01:13:40,160
focus and obesity CPR again that's sort of the bread and butter to be a G but that

707
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:46,069
Kristen Davidson articles that nice one to illustrate that and I think here it brings

708
01:13:46,070 --> 01:13:51,020
up that education point again so like internet you know approaches are great,

709
01:13:52,520 --> 01:13:58,100
mobile health approaches are great, but you need to have access and infrastructure available to the ability for that.

710
01:13:58,460 --> 01:14:03,350
And even this research is showing that that they're more effective when parents are more educated,

711
01:14:04,190 --> 01:14:14,570
makes sense, like that's where people are finding their information. Okay, so I will put these up for you guys.

712
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:25,879
And I think, oh, yeah, I, I sent I haven't gotten a chance to look at the survey, the midpoint survey results.

713
01:14:25,880 --> 01:14:30,590
But if you guys have feedback, please go ahead and fill that out next time.

714
01:14:30,590 --> 01:14:42,530
We're going to talk about after break childhood obesity and another way to think about interventions in that space,

715
01:14:42,530 --> 01:14:45,620
but that can apply also to other other child health considerations.

716
01:14:46,610 --> 01:14:56,510
So I think that we're all set, but I hope you guys have a good break and I will see you after things.

717
01:15:05,930 --> 01:15:30,300
I think. I mean, I feel like I don't really have anything with that.

718
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:49,230
We're not exactly in love with you.

719
01:15:49,300 --> 01:15:56,790
Right? Right. Cause I feel like if you feel like a little earlier, something earlier.

720
01:15:58,120 --> 01:16:01,990
I don't do that. I always get there, like 30 years later.

721
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:17,160
Right. Yeah. I feel like my health, it's like I can't even imagine, you know, I was talking about 30 years ago.

722
01:16:17,700 --> 01:16:28,259
I forgot how good I feel. Like I didn't know that we play a sport in my life.

723
01:16:28,260 --> 01:16:32,490
I don't know. I don't know. Yeah.

724
01:16:33,420 --> 01:16:41,100
And it's a lot more like your professional life has been around for a while.

725
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:46,450
My daughter. When you're.

726
01:16:49,330 --> 01:17:13,310
Yeah. Okay.

727
01:17:56,300 --> 01:19:07,560
Well. They are.

728
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:14,720
I know.
