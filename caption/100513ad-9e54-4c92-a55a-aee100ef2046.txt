1
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:10,470
In this video, we
address the ways

2
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:13,559
markets might fail to
yield optimal outcomes.

3
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:16,380
Therefore, our learning
objective is to apply

4
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:19,710
a typology of sources of
market failure to healthcare,

5
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,340
to analyze why sub-optimal
outcomes can occur.

6
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,550
In a previous video,

7
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:27,290
we concluded that a
market made up of

8
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:30,200
consumers and firms pursuing
their own interests,

9
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:34,000
would yield several desirable
outcomes, even awesomeness.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,500
Those outcomes include the
production of the set of

11
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,245
goods and services most
valuable to consumers,

12
00:00:39,245 --> 00:00:42,755
while efficiently utilizing
society's scarce inputs.

13
00:00:42,755 --> 00:00:44,930
Aside from a minimal
government role in

14
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:47,825
defining and enforcing
rules like property rights,

15
00:00:47,825 --> 00:00:49,370
and the potential for enacting

16
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:52,670
some re-distributive measures
to address equity concerns,

17
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:54,095
the outcome was ideal,

18
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:55,430
and could only be made worse

19
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,790
by further government
intervention.

20
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:00,020
On the demand side of the market,

21
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:01,970
several assumptions
underlie what we

22
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:04,340
call rational consumer behavior.

23
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:07,400
Consumers are assumed to
have a set of well defined,

24
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,740
stable, and time
consistent preferences.

25
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:11,780
They are also assumed to have

26
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,360
the information needed
to compare alternatives,

27
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,250
and the processing
capability to weigh

28
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:19,235
marginal benefits
against marginal costs.

29
00:01:19,235 --> 00:01:21,334
In the healthcare context,

30
00:01:21,334 --> 00:01:23,240
this would require
consumers to know the

31
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:26,270
advantages and disadvantages
of treatment options,

32
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:27,800
or at least be able to obtain

33
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,270
reliable information from

34
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:31,279
their physicians
or other sources,

35
00:01:31,279 --> 00:01:32,720
to know the quality of care

36
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,715
delivered by
alternative providers,

37
00:01:34,715 --> 00:01:36,500
and to know the prices that each

38
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,660
would charge for their services.

39
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:40,895
On the supply side of the market,

40
00:01:40,895 --> 00:01:42,680
several assumptions are required

41
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,600
to achieve the competitive ideal.

42
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,865
There needs to be a
large number of firms,

43
00:01:46,865 --> 00:01:49,510
each too small to affect
the market price.

44
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:51,110
Is also assumed that there are

45
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:53,100
no barriers to entry
in the long run.

46
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,550
That is, if a new competitor
see as profit opportunity,

47
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:59,075
they might not be only
product for sale today,

48
00:01:59,075 --> 00:02:00,350
but given some time they,

49
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:02,380
could freely join the industry.

50
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:04,985
Imagine in an industry
like wheat farming,

51
00:02:04,985 --> 00:02:06,770
even a large farm produces

52
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:09,230
an infinitesimal fraction
of the world's wheat.

53
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:11,569
They simply observe
the market price,

54
00:02:11,569 --> 00:02:13,880
and decide how much of
their production to sell,

55
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,625
and how much to hold back in
the hope of a higher price.

56
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:18,260
But that decision itself is

57
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,820
too insignificant relative to

58
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,920
the market to impact the price.

59
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,070
Conversely, a very large
firm like Microsoft,

60
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:28,400
or a firm whose market is
very local like a hospital,

61
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,060
could definitely
influenced the price.

62
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,480
For ideal market outcomes,

63
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,000
we also need prices to send

64
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,880
the right signals to consumers
about how much to buy,

65
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,700
and to firms, about
how much to produce.

66
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,160
In particular, prices
should capture

67
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,979
all the costs and benefits
of the good or activity,

68
00:02:45,979 --> 00:02:48,560
so the actors don't ignore
those costs or benefits,

69
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,359
when they make their decisions.

70
00:02:50,359 --> 00:02:53,585
Finally, markets work
well for private goods.

71
00:02:53,585 --> 00:02:56,840
Those that only the person
buying them gets to enjoy.

72
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,685
As we'll see shortly,

73
00:02:58,685 --> 00:03:00,980
public goods cause a
free rider problem,

74
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,780
where nobody has
sufficient incentive

75
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:04,280
to pay for their creation,

76
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,810
in the hope that
they can enjoy the

77
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:08,095
good paid for by others.

78
00:03:08,095 --> 00:03:10,870
Now, that we understand
the conditions that must

79
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:13,120
hold for markets to
yield ideal outcomes,

80
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,160
let's look at why
markets might fail

81
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,885
to achieve this
theoretical awesomeness.

82
00:03:17,885 --> 00:03:20,580
First, we'll consider consumers.

83
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:23,800
For several reasons,
consumers could fall short,

84
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,815
of being the omniscient
marginal benefit

85
00:03:25,815 --> 00:03:27,430
and marginal cost balancers,

86
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:29,770
that economic theory
assumes them to be.

87
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:32,470
First, preferences
might be incomplete.

88
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:34,300
That is, consumers might look at

89
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,740
alternative bundles and simply

90
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:39,235
be unable to reach a conclusion
about which is preferred.

91
00:03:39,235 --> 00:03:43,000
Second, even if consumers
have complete preferences,

92
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,720
they may be too poorly informed,

93
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,050
to effectively act on
those preferences.

94
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:48,910
This is particularly problematic

95
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,775
when the seller is
better informed,

96
00:03:50,775 --> 00:03:52,490
creating a strategic advantage

97
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:54,620
that can be used
against the consumer.

98
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,690
Economists call that a situation

99
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:58,885
with asymmetric information.

100
00:03:58,885 --> 00:04:02,135
Finally, the field of
behavioral economics,

101
00:04:02,135 --> 00:04:03,260
which seeks to combine

102
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,615
psychological insights
with economics,

103
00:04:05,615 --> 00:04:08,630
suggests a number of ways
in which consumer decisions

104
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:10,010
deviate from what basic

105
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:12,305
microeconomic theory
would predict.

106
00:04:12,305 --> 00:04:15,545
Decisions are often
dependent on context.

107
00:04:15,545 --> 00:04:18,080
For example, retirement savings

108
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,300
is a sufficiently
important decision,

109
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,310
that it should not be
influenced by whether or

110
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:24,860
not the default in
your employer's plan,

111
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,710
is participation unless
you actively opt out,

112
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:30,800
or non-participation unless
you actively opt in.

113
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,930
In fact, participation rates are

114
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:36,200
substantially higher if
you have to opt out.

115
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:39,780
Economists expect people
to value an outcome today,

116
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,550
more than an outcome tomorrow.

117
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:43,875
This is called
discounting the future.

118
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:45,680
However, people often seem to

119
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,870
place weight on the
present that is excessive,

120
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,570
relative to benchmarks
like interest rates.

121
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:52,370
This can create conflicts where

122
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:53,690
our future selves hate

123
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:56,255
the decisions made by
our current selves.

124
00:04:56,255 --> 00:04:58,655
If our current
selves realize this,

125
00:04:58,655 --> 00:05:01,070
we might look for a
commitment devices to try to

126
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:04,760
help us make and stick
with better decisions.

127
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,415
Turning to the supply side,

128
00:05:07,415 --> 00:05:10,145
if firms are too large
relative to their market,

129
00:05:10,145 --> 00:05:12,680
their decisions can
influence prices.

130
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,780
In particular, those firms can

131
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:17,360
restrict output below
the competitive level.

132
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,685
That creates an
artificial scarcity,

133
00:05:19,685 --> 00:05:22,930
which can raise the price
and profits along with it.

134
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:25,090
The harm to society is that,

135
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:27,470
unlike the perfectly
competitive equilibrium,

136
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:29,780
some units for which
marginal benefits

137
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:32,420
exceed marginal costs
are not produced.

138
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:34,280
Therefore, the net benefits from

139
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,990
that product are not maximized.

140
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,460
In addition to
excessively high prices

141
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:42,455
arising from firm's market power,

142
00:05:42,455 --> 00:05:44,660
prices can send
dysfunctional signals

143
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:46,555
for a number of other reasons.

144
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:49,370
One particularly
pertinent to health care,

145
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:51,050
is that having insurance reduces

146
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:53,380
the personal cost
of adverse events.

147
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:56,375
That creates a situation
called moral hazard.

148
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:58,940
If insurance pays for
the adverse event,

149
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,530
I have less incentive to take

150
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:01,940
costly measures to prevent it

151
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,815
from happening in
the first place.

152
00:06:03,815 --> 00:06:06,200
Then if it still does happen,

153
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,820
I'll have two little incentive to

154
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,740
mitigate the cost of the event.

155
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,300
For example, if I have

156
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,670
health insurance that
covers hospitalization,

157
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:15,605
and an extra day is free to me,

158
00:06:15,605 --> 00:06:17,270
I don't have as much incentive to

159
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,890
try to be discharged earlier,

160
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:22,110
than if I had to pay for
each day out of pocket.

161
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,310
Another way in which prices can

162
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:27,200
send as functional signals,

163
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,520
is when some of the costs or

164
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,650
benefits accrue to a third party,

165
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:32,855
and are not reflected
in the price.

166
00:06:32,855 --> 00:06:35,605
An example of a
positive externality,

167
00:06:35,605 --> 00:06:36,980
is that my neighbors enjoy

168
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,720
seeing the flowers in my garden,

169
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,705
but I can't charge them for
the value of that enjoyment.

170
00:06:41,705 --> 00:06:44,420
As a result, I plant
too few flowers,

171
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,504
from a societal perspective.

172
00:06:46,504 --> 00:06:49,295
An example of a
negative externality,

173
00:06:49,295 --> 00:06:50,660
is that polluters don't have to

174
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,820
pay for asthma hospitalizations.

175
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:55,190
They have an incentive
to ignore those costs,

176
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:57,100
and pollute too much.

177
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:00,430
A final way in which prices
can be dysfunctional,

178
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:02,135
is when a good is public.

179
00:07:02,135 --> 00:07:05,765
A public good is where once
somebody pays to produce it,

180
00:07:05,765 --> 00:07:07,445
it can be enjoyed by all.

181
00:07:07,445 --> 00:07:10,310
Unlike a burger, once a
public good is produced,

182
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:13,145
we can't exclude non-payers
from enjoying it.

183
00:07:13,145 --> 00:07:15,260
Examples of public goods include

184
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,615
national defense and
street lighting.

185
00:07:17,615 --> 00:07:19,460
Everyone hopes somebody else will

186
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:20,990
pay to provide the public good,

187
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:23,630
but has little personal
incentive to contribute.

188
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:26,300
This is known as free
riding behavior.

189
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:29,015
My own contribution would
benefit all others,

190
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:31,495
but I can't charge them
for those benefits.

191
00:07:31,495 --> 00:07:33,935
Similarly, because
of free riding,

192
00:07:33,935 --> 00:07:35,570
a firm would have
little incentive

193
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:37,130
to provide a public good.

194
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:40,250
It would have to rely on
voluntary contributions,

195
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,290
that would very
likely be inadequate

196
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:45,120
to pay for ideal
amounts of the good.

197
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:49,985
My friend Harold Pollack from
the University of Chicago,

198
00:07:49,985 --> 00:07:52,340
conveniently summarize
the key ideas of

199
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:55,075
microeconomics on a
single index card.

200
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:57,470
I suggest that you print
out a copy and look

201
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:00,725
back at it throughout
this course, and beyond.

202
00:08:00,725 --> 00:08:04,400
To summarize, achieving
the ideal outcomes of

203
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,990
a competitive market relies on

204
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:08,035
multiple assumptions being met.

205
00:08:08,035 --> 00:08:09,930
When these assumptions fail,

206
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:11,240
markets may not produce

207
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,490
the right amounts of
the right products.

208
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:15,725
Prices may become dysfunctional.

209
00:08:15,725 --> 00:08:18,920
They would still provide
incentives to economic actors,

210
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,930
but they would be the
wrong incentives.
