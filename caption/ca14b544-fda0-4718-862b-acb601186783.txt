1
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:10,890
In this module, I'll
give you an overview

2
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:13,050
of how we dispose of solid waste.

3
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:14,070
Actually, here at

4
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,170
the University of Michigan
campus in Ann Arbor,

5
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:17,910
we've been making
tremendous efforts

6
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:19,350
to increase the amount of

7
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,845
recycling and composting we
do to reduce our solid waste.

8
00:00:22,845 --> 00:00:24,840
In fact, the University
has been recycling for

9
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,035
more than 30 years and
composting for more than 20.

10
00:00:28,035 --> 00:00:30,300
Lots of communities
around the United States

11
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,345
including hopefully yours
have made similar efforts.

12
00:00:33,345 --> 00:00:35,250
But as we'll see
this is not the case

13
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,175
necessarily around
the entire globe.

14
00:00:38,175 --> 00:00:40,460
I'd like to begin by highlighting

15
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:42,170
how the United
States differs from

16
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:44,210
other countries
around the world in

17
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:46,970
terms of how we dispose
of our solid waste.

18
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:49,295
We talked in another
module about how

19
00:00:49,295 --> 00:00:51,410
approximately half
of the materials

20
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:53,030
created in the United States are

21
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:56,780
sent to a landfill and
how the remainder are

22
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:58,880
dealt with primarily
through recycling but

23
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,375
also through composting
and incineration.

24
00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:03,470
However, I'd like to
highlight the fact that

25
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:05,270
even countries that
are very close to

26
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:06,830
each other around the globe

27
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:09,170
actually have very different
disposal techniques.

28
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:11,960
So if we look just south
of our border to Mexico,

29
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,880
you can see on the map here that

30
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,730
land-filling represented
in dark blue is how

31
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:19,940
the vast majority of solid
waste produced in Mexico is

32
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:21,980
disposed off with a very
small fraction that's

33
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:24,395
actually disposed
up by recycling.

34
00:01:24,395 --> 00:01:26,570
We can zoom all the way
around the world to

35
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:29,210
the other side to Japan
and you can see there

36
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:31,265
the primary color on their bar

37
00:01:31,265 --> 00:01:33,680
is orange which
represents incineration.

38
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,685
So in Japan most solid waste
is burned to create energy.

39
00:01:37,685 --> 00:01:40,070
We can also look at Western
Europe as you'll see

40
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:43,310
is sort of blown up in the
middle of the image here,

41
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:44,765
and even Western Europe which

42
00:01:44,765 --> 00:01:46,640
could be viewed at
a very high level

43
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,319
as being relatively homogeneous

44
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:50,450
turns out to have
huge differences.

45
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:52,730
So the country of
Turkey, for example,

46
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:54,770
you'll see disposes
of effectively

47
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:58,285
a 100 percent of their solid
waste by land-filling it.

48
00:01:58,285 --> 00:02:01,175
On the other hand,
Sweden actually produces

49
00:02:01,175 --> 00:02:02,870
a great amount of energy through

50
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,640
incineration of their waste.

51
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,200
You can see there are differences

52
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,565
particularly in terms of

53
00:02:07,565 --> 00:02:10,354
composting being a
primary mechanism

54
00:02:10,354 --> 00:02:12,770
of solid waste
disposal in Austria.

55
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:15,170
So again techniques for

56
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:17,750
dealing with solid waste and
disposing of it can vary

57
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:20,030
widely even among countries
that are quite close

58
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:23,450
together and seem relatively
similar at first blush.

59
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:26,300
This rather complex graphic shows

60
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,620
you the countries that have

61
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,240
the highest percentage of

62
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,520
their total solid waste
that gets recycled.

63
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,430
Going from the very highest
countries South Korea in

64
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:37,820
the upper left corner which
recycles nearly 50 percent of

65
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,650
all the solid waste they produce

66
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:41,960
down to the lower right
corner where in fact Italy

67
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,940
in Western Europe
recycles effectively

68
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,325
zero percent of
their solid waste.

69
00:02:46,325 --> 00:02:48,140
So you can see the
first two columns

70
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:50,030
here we have countries
that are doing

71
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,980
at least a quarter of

72
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:54,770
their total solid waste
as recycled materials.

73
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:56,660
When we move into the third
column and you'll see

74
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:58,880
the US here
highlighted in orange,

75
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,900
we get to countries that are

76
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,180
between 20 and 27 percent

77
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,995
of their total solid
waste recycled.

78
00:03:03,995 --> 00:03:07,730
So again, the key concept
to take away here is

79
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:09,200
that though countries may be

80
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,480
demographically similar
or regionally similar,

81
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,970
we see huge differences
in how they go

82
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:17,605
about disposing of the
solid waste they produce.

83
00:03:17,605 --> 00:03:21,215
Let's also think about how
waste production might

84
00:03:21,215 --> 00:03:24,500
grow over time particularly
in developing nations.

85
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:28,400
So in 2012 of the entire
planet's population,

86
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,665
about 3 billion people lived in

87
00:03:30,665 --> 00:03:33,200
urban areas and they
were each creating

88
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:38,465
about 1.2 kilograms of solid
waste per person per day.

89
00:03:38,465 --> 00:03:41,435
If we fast forward to 2025,

90
00:03:41,435 --> 00:03:43,560
there's going to be
an anticipated 4.3

91
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,910
billion now living in
urban areas producing

92
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,860
slightly more waste about 1.4

93
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:52,550
kilograms of solid waste
per person per day.

94
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:54,080
Most of that growth is going to

95
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,500
happen in developing nations.

96
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,780
Globally, the Organization
for Economic Cooperation

97
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:02,030
and Development or OECD countries

98
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:03,995
generate about 44 percent

99
00:04:03,995 --> 00:04:06,080
of the total solid
waste produced.

100
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,975
Only about 12 percent comes
from Latin America and

101
00:04:08,975 --> 00:04:12,020
today only about five
percent comes from Africa.

102
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,925
But again these are
areas where a lot of

103
00:04:13,925 --> 00:04:15,740
urbanization is going
to occur and so

104
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,000
the amount of waste produced in

105
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,330
those areas is going to
increase substantially.

106
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:23,390
As we think about
people and solid waste

107
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:25,870
in developing low-income
and middle-income nations,

108
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:28,295
there's a number of
different types of people

109
00:04:28,295 --> 00:04:29,510
who are potentially going to have

110
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:31,145
exposures to solid waste.

111
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:33,470
Of course, the people who
generate the waste often

112
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:35,920
consumers or businesses
are exposed.

113
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,590
People who go around collecting

114
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:39,660
that waste are very much exposed.

115
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:42,335
People who live in neighborhoods
that often grow up

116
00:04:42,335 --> 00:04:45,380
around where waste is
actually disposed of,

117
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,990
and certainly waste pickers
recyclers some of whom

118
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:51,785
actually live in the areas
where waste is disposed.

119
00:04:51,785 --> 00:04:53,960
I'd like to wrap up
here by showing you

120
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,640
a framework designed to help you

121
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,260
understand the linkages between

122
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:00,845
poor solid waste management
and adverse health outcomes.

123
00:05:00,845 --> 00:05:02,780
So this is a great graphic from

124
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:05,030
a paper you can see
the citation below.

125
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:06,950
Let's think first
about what types

126
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:08,930
of wastes people
might be exposed to.

127
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:11,000
So in the center of
this image you'll see

128
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,170
organic waste and on

129
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:13,910
the right you'll see
inorganic waste.

130
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:15,860
When we think about
inorganic waste

131
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,150
that waste could be inert,

132
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,635
it doesn't really react or

133
00:05:18,635 --> 00:05:20,510
respond to the
environment around it.

134
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:21,920
But it could also consist of

135
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,320
noxious chemicals that
could be toxic to us,

136
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,610
and it might also include

137
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:28,505
physical hazards
like sharp objects.

138
00:05:28,505 --> 00:05:32,465
Once we have humans in contact
with the waste or exposed,

139
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:33,680
then we have to
think about what's

140
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,510
the potential mechanism
of harm here.

141
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:37,340
So for organic waste

142
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,920
that waste is going to
decompose over time and as

143
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,230
part of that
decomposition process

144
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:44,875
we're going to have potential
vectors of disease,

145
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:47,130
insects, and animals for example.

146
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:49,910
For inorganic waste
that inert waste that I

147
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:52,849
mentioned could end up
simply blocking drains,

148
00:05:52,849 --> 00:05:54,830
it may end up
resulting in flooding,

149
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,630
and it's not unusual
for floods around

150
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:58,190
waste disposal sites to kill

151
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:00,350
sometimes tens or
dozens of people.

152
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:03,350
It could also result in
breakages of sewers if it clogs

153
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:04,460
a sewer line and now we have

154
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,550
sewage spilling
through a community.

155
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:09,290
Those noxious chemicals
if they come into contact

156
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:11,900
with people could
cause skin rashes,

157
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:12,950
they could cause burns, there

158
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:15,215
might be respiratory exposure.

159
00:06:15,215 --> 00:06:17,270
The chemicals could
be outside and

160
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:19,750
causing harm or inside the
body and causing harm.

161
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,270
For the sharp objects,

162
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,850
we could start to think
about things like

163
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:25,885
cuts or other
penetrating injuries.

164
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:28,940
Finally, if we now
add the third layer

165
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:31,580
here to this graphic of health
impacts there are many.

166
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,110
So I mentioned for

167
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:35,570
organic solid waste there
are going to be vectors,

168
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:37,640
anytime we have vectors
we have the potential for

169
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,880
infection with things like
malaria or other diseases.

170
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,290
There could be skin infections

171
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:43,940
simply from coming
into contact with

172
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,740
decomposing materials or we

173
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:48,530
might get
gastrointestinal impacts.

174
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:50,420
For inorganic solid waste,

175
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:51,500
we can start to think about

176
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,770
those noxious chemicals perhaps
resulting in things like

177
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:57,005
cancer or respiratory disease

178
00:06:57,005 --> 00:06:59,500
or death with
sufficient exposure.

179
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,090
We could also think about not
chronic health effects but

180
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:03,710
more acute poisonings people

181
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:05,270
could get burns from chemicals,

182
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:07,610
have allergic
reactions, again die

183
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:10,405
from an acute dose of
a harmful chemical.

184
00:07:10,405 --> 00:07:12,740
Those physical hazards could

185
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:14,390
also result in bodily injury.

186
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:16,280
So obstruction from flooding

187
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,990
could lead to a drowning death,

188
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:19,430
we might get people getting

189
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:21,440
cut or having otherwise deaths

190
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,495
from being crushed or

191
00:07:23,495 --> 00:07:25,790
lacerated by some
of these materials.

192
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:27,890
So solid waste management

193
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:29,950
is something that
every country does.

194
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,430
Many countries do
it different ways,

195
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:36,050
but the key thing is that if
it's done improperly it has

196
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:37,190
the potential to cause

197
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:41,397
substantial adverse health
impacts to the public.
