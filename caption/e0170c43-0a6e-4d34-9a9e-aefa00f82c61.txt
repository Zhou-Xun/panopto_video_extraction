1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:05,370
Oh, really? I told you. Well, that changes things.

2
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:14,540
You might want to use this for me.

3
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:42,560
I'm dating weddings, marketing solutions clients because I'm like you first.

4
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:51,800
I just, like, went on vacation for years. Many classes have an advantage.

5
00:00:52,070 --> 00:01:57,790
It's like. Yes.

6
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:38,630
I'm going. Recording in progress.

7
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,190
It's pretty obvious she's.

8
00:02:57,580 --> 00:04:18,940
He. Sure.

9
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:52,730
It's still. You should have come today.

10
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:03,140
I think she's probably waiting outside this weekend with her husband.

11
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:09,430
Just. Our parents.

12
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:14,550
Yeah. I mean, I, you know, it's a bit.

13
00:06:35,030 --> 00:07:47,670
As much. Yes, she did.

14
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:32,210
As we saw. I have to go into the trust center settings and look at the location of the getting to a location like wherever I saved it to.

15
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:37,000
I have to add that location, the trust center settings so that it would work because I was running it.

16
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:41,500
You. You.

17
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,990
Since Goodrich locations.

18
00:08:56,540 --> 00:09:14,540
Yeah, I did that. And then I did add new location and pasted in the file past where I saved the microphone and completed.

19
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:43,080
Yeah, I didn't. I think I closed that next because we allowed it trust to mention.

20
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:46,300
Thank you. Okay.

21
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:54,990
Thank you. You're welcome. Okay.

22
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:59,660
So last time, teachers.

23
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:13,440
That's all right.

24
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:24,629
Let's keep going. So last time we were solving a linear program for selecting selected combination

25
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:30,560
of the search said or in person to a certain time based on requirements.

26
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:43,950
And we found that the best combination would be 1.25 servings of that and 1.8 and five servings of ice cream.

27
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:51,590
Right. Now, we are going to do sensitivity analysis out of that and it use a two way cable.

28
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:57,450
So get table to see how the optimal dessert plan varies when we're covering for a

29
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:05,909
snack or an ice cream very late for will vary from 80 to 200 in increments of ten,

30
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:11,399
and let the latter vary from 120 to 300 in increments of ten.

31
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:19,290
So. So we have a the optimal dessert plan that with the calorie versus not the ice cream.

32
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:26,010
Very good. So let's see. What we have is empty calories.

33
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:29,720
There is not much here.

34
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,580
Right. The calories per is not of the calories for ice cream.

35
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:39,450
So these two are the ones that we need to find.

36
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:47,849
So these are going to be the big variables in this case that are going to increase and is going to be a two way table.

37
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:57,630
So we're going to do is change put different values of the calories versus different values of the calories per ice cream.

38
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:05,130
So for each combination and figure out the new solution, so what is what the solution is going to be?

39
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:09,840
And also what is the total take in this is going to be.

40
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,320
So to see how they taste based on the theory.

41
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:18,870
So for Dog, just remember what we're going to do.

42
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:28,320
So the first one, 80 to 200 in increments of ten, and the second one, 2300 increments of ten.

43
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:34,930
So remember this number. Well, you're going to remember that.

44
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:45,660
So the first thing is you should have it so very well in worse shape than that that you are using silver table.

45
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:51,510
And we know we have because in your data, I'm being sober.

46
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:53,850
Yeah, this is a silver model.

47
00:13:53,970 --> 00:14:03,000
This is what silver is going to silver table is going to call the silver model again and again and again to to solve a new linear problem.

48
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:14,340
So we are fine on that. So now we are ready to call the silver table.

49
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:23,000
So you income silver table and then I run silver table and it says you should have an existing silver gold.

50
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:27,030
Okay, you ready to get over that?

51
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:36,930
And then what we are going to do is create it to wait the way people means that there are two parameters that I'm going to change at the same time.

52
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:41,430
If I were changing just one parameter, then that will be a one we table.

53
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:50,820
This is a two way table which was going to parameter and then I click okay and now we are going to populate this template.

54
00:14:51,150 --> 00:15:04,800
So input cell number one, sometimes I wish I had done this before and I can do that is name the sales.

55
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:12,809
So if I named this, sales will be much easier for me to figure out what the solution is when I get the solution.

56
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:23,730
So let me close that second and I'm going to look for the name of these sales and then at least these one I'm going to call,

57
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:33,320
none of them are calories.

58
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:45,480
It's. This is going to be ice cream.

59
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:50,700
Ice cream and.

60
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:01,540
Okay. And the optimal solution.

61
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:10,400
I'm also going to you know, you know, I'm going to name those two sales.

62
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:15,880
One is going to be the servings.

63
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:21,590
It's not by saying it's like four servings.

64
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:33,080
Servings per day. You know what I mean? And the other one is going to be ice cream.

65
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:50,790
Service. Finally, the optimal solution is the total based investment.

66
00:16:55,710 --> 00:17:01,350
It used to be understood little things.

67
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:18,330
Makes. So the tables sometimes just point to the location of the variables and you know, you have to go back to the model if you like.

68
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:27,870
I think we have to define all the variables that we are looking at that we're going to look at and

69
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:39,480
the pieces of the way people and the first inputs in one cell is going to be the snack bar calories,

70
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:46,360
which is this one. I can call that not how we.

71
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:54,080
Part of the problem probably doesn't matter you.

72
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:04,320
A little removed and then he's is the second he would say the one is going to the ice cream.

73
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:12,710
It's. I.

74
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:22,860
Then I can give a label. Sometimes it's when I use it in some places and some places not.

75
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:26,520
But it's not big business. So that makes.

76
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:46,360
Every night. Calories.

77
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:58,260
They were ice cream.

78
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:12,000
We'll. Sure.

79
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:22,220
Meaning that these up as servants are serving.

80
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:31,640
Okay. So you remember what he said for four days?

81
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:35,630
Not very. It's not like casualties.

82
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:46,550
The minimum value is going to be one, 80, 80 and the maximum 200, 200 in increments of ten, right?

83
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:58,670
Yes. And the second one is going to be the minimum one 2122, the maximum 300, 300.

84
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,840
Not really. In terms of penalty, right? Yes.

85
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:13,700
And then finally, something. So this this is going to be the variability of the of the of those input variable.

86
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:17,809
The the calories of per is not defined in calories per ice cream.

87
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:21,590
Sorry. Okay. And then what is that?

88
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:27,110
I want to show I want to show the impact on certain output sales.

89
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:40,280
And that's going to be the optimal solution, going to be the optimal escaping how many servings per hour and how many servings of ice cream.

90
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:44,870
And also the total base index, which is what we want to do, maximize.

91
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:53,460
So I'm not going to waste more time hyping the names of this building book that Excel will do that.

92
00:20:54,770 --> 00:21:07,000
So but this is going to be the bar and service and the ice cream service,

93
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:16,370
and then you're going to price control and then you are going to click on the total based in this year, right.

94
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:33,340
So what we have so automatically the Excel or silver table, what they call them, the the right time, the right point to it to to the total to exceed.

95
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:45,530
Okay. So right now, what we're talking about is 20, 20 -80 is 1213.

96
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:49,090
And then this city, 18, 19.

97
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:53,830
So we have a grid of 1938.

98
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:59,120
So that that's the total number of linear programs that we want to solve.

99
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:06,420
So for each combination of the bars and the ice creams,

100
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:19,940
calories we're going to solve in your linear program and and then we're going to populate the whole is the whole set about 98.

101
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:24,860
And all these solvers is calling solver many times.

102
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:39,250
Okay. So here we have 2 minutes.

103
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:41,680
Okay.

104
00:22:42,940 --> 00:23:03,850
So so we have here the calories per hour servings itself is seven alongside and the calories per snack is is not bar servings life along the side,

105
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:09,950
which is not more servings and then the calories of their ice cream volume.

106
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:14,050
So this is this landmark. This is the calories.

107
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:25,240
Right. And then in the middle here, the values are on top of that.

108
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:35,170
So in course, I would tell you. So these is going to be the number of ice is not bar servings,

109
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:43,620
and this is going to be the number of ice ice cream servings and this is going to be the number of total 16.

110
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:57,400
Okay. So let's remember that these numbers they are they in increments of ten are the calories per snack bar.

111
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:07,330
I can go from 880 to 200 and that's the alongside the calories per ice cream.

112
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:12,160
Are these 100 going from 120 to 300?

113
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:21,610
And these numbers here, all these numbers correspond to the optimal solution for this combination.

114
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:26,139
Four, it is not large servings and basically ice cream.

115
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:31,080
This is simply thought.

116
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:39,820
For example, suppose that you have you increase the calories per pound.

117
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:50,220
The calories per serving of is not bar to 259 and the calories for ice cream sorry,

118
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:58,240
it's not the calories per ice cream serving them 260 and the calories are not bar 200.

119
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:09,730
Right. You're put into it. So you have these here, these number here in the intersection of this two that tells you that they at that point,

120
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:23,470
the solution, the optimal solution would tell you that you have to have at 4.5 servings of a snack bar.

121
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:31,330
And at the same time, two, one, two, three, you have no servings of ice cream at that point.

122
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:37,989
And your taste index, that would be 1 to 3 14,153.

123
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:51,850
That's that's why you can do even those taking the calories for a snack bar goes to 100 and that ice cream serving is good good.

124
00:25:52,840 --> 00:26:01,240
We know that took these things to high and that's where you are not going to have any ice cream servings of that.

125
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:18,700
So and if you call on increases in the number of calories for ice cream servings and of snack bar and bar servings and snack bars and ice cream,

126
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:24,849
right. Servings, what you're going to have in this region is that you cannot solve that problem.

127
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:28,030
It's not feasible. There's no physical review at that point.

128
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:37,230
So you make all strains that do not there is no point to satisfy all of them at the same price.

129
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:41,050
And it tells you that's too many calories. That is not feasible.

130
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:43,780
Certainly not feasible solution in this review.

131
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:52,800
No feasible solution is right now that you will give you the complete picture, but you can also draw graphs.

132
00:26:53,140 --> 00:27:07,120
Right? For example, this one is think these one is the sensitivity of the it's not bar servings calories per ice cream.

133
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:13,440
Sorry, the sensitivity of it's not our servings to calories per ice cream service.

134
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:29,380
So if I fix the they the calories if I fix the calories per snack bar servings and I change the calories for ice cream servings,

135
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:36,040
how this is going to affect the number of snack bar servings, it's not going to affect.

136
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:40,320
Right. Is this number. So it's going to take a.

137
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:51,940
If I start. So it's going to be five. So if I say this over and over is that we got the resolution initially that was.

138
00:27:56,750 --> 00:28:05,180
We have something like five here because I already.

139
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:11,510
What what is the then number?

140
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:18,590
What is the calories burned for you? Not number of calories for ice cream.

141
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:33,590
I'm 6160 and the number 40 in a number of countries for the stock market, 20, 20, 21, 20 here.

142
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:46,300
This is one. Okay, now, now what we have here is I have seen the number.

143
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:50,320
So it's not this is this is are snack bars or things.

144
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:58,210
And these these are put on calories, but it's not fast servings.

145
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:07,490
Okay. He's making. I did.

146
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:14,680
Okay. So this is going to be the number one is snack bar service.

147
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:20,930
Right. So this is going to be the number of the amount of hours, not part service.

148
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:34,130
And while the number here is the calories per hour and in calories per hour, it's not a bar.

149
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:38,650
So 120 calories per nice bar times is a snack bar serving.

150
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:47,240
So 1.8 calories per is not bar. But then I increase the calories per it's ice cream.

151
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:57,740
The calories per ice cream goes to 1.2 301 20 to 300.

152
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:09,730
And then you see the sensitivity. This is this is the total number of it's not bar serving waiting for how long.

153
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:17,680
So this is that is not bar servings to calories here.

154
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:23,280
And the solution is the ratio.

155
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:32,650
One. Some of it's not.

156
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:52,620
1875. Excuse or ease their eyes to what?

157
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:58,440
What goes from 80 to what is going from 80 to 200?

158
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:06,680
Your part is not over. So this is not by road from 80 to 200.

159
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:15,110
And so but the value that we started was 1.8, right?

160
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:18,980
Yeah. This is the current is better and it's not far.

161
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:31,930
And then these are the calories burned not far. And then 126 and these are the calories, ice cream and the calories for ice cream.

162
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:38,899
If we start increasing the calories for ice cream, that's how the calorie that's serving.

163
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:47,570
So if it's not bar, that's how they look like. So if I start increasing the calories of ice cream.

164
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:59,570
121 3140 So you see the number of servings of the number of servings of a snack bar,

165
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:05,450
you know, is going to be going down, down, down, down, down, down, right until I get zero.

166
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:13,290
It's not part because all the things, everything else is going to be it.

167
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:16,640
Everything else is going to be ice cream at this point.

168
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:19,430
Right. Source gets only the calories.

169
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:34,670
And then there is a point in to say, I got the calories for ice cream, you know, are so high, 250 now we abandon ice cream.

170
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:38,120
And when can we go back to oral? It's not far.

171
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:41,660
So this is what you see that line here.

172
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:47,960
So for a while, you increase the calories first, not ice cream.

173
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:56,930
Okay. And the ultimate solution, because, you know, she likes ice cream is is going to try to get ice cream in the optimal solution.

174
00:32:56,930 --> 00:33:04,790
So that and but but there are too many calories and the number of them are going to go down at one point.

175
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:09,310
There's no more ice cream that you can.

176
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:13,160
You can. And then.

177
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:19,280
Yeah. And look, you can have.

178
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:33,200
Sorry, there's no more snack matter than you can have. And then at that point, when you get when you get the ice cream to high in here,

179
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,160
there's going to be zero ice cream and everything's going to be is not working.

180
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:41,749
So I misspoke at the beginning.

181
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:46,970
These are the snack bar servings when you increase the ice cream.

182
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:50,660
So increase the ice cream and it's not large servings.

183
00:33:50,990 --> 00:34:04,270
You know, for those who are getting all the calories from ice cream, at one point, they you know, it's not the ice cream.

184
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:07,080
It can supply all the calories. So there's no number.

185
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:14,890
So the point, you cannot sustain that many calories of the ice cream and then everything, that's not right.

186
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:24,650
So at that point and that's at that point, the number of calories per the number of ice cream,

187
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:29,990
the number of ice cream servings at this point should be zero.

188
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:48,520
So this is the it's not a bar. So see if we can get to the counter part of these with when we increase the the

189
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:54,320
calories of ice cream where I want to see the graph of the ice cream servings.

190
00:34:54,950 --> 00:35:01,500
Okay. So unless you see the.

191
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:18,230
So we don't it's not about our surroundings.

192
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:31,480
You. The.

193
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:45,130
Calories. Snack servings in calories.

194
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:55,830
Ice cream servings. I was gonna use.

195
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:21,080
She shoot demons. So this is a this is sensitive and it is this graph is going to be the sensitivity of the.

196
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,640
So this is the output and this is what is changing, right?

197
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:37,740
So I want to have a normal graph exactly like that, but it is varying the other one.

198
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:43,340
But I can I think I can do that. Calories for ice cream servings.

199
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:51,659
Right when increase the ice cream. And what I'm looking at is the snack bar servings.

200
00:36:51,660 --> 00:37:06,750
So if I do exactly like that, but if I do, what I want to do is the orange is ice cream servings and those can be ice cream servings here.

201
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:18,840
Yeah. So that's that's the counter part and that's where you see before you see when you get to a point that the ice cream gets to,

202
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:23,730
to be to too many calories.

203
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:28,170
Right? Then the ice cream. The ice cream is zero.

204
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:39,990
So the optimal solution of ice cream is zero. Here, the ice cream is going to go increase in increasing as the snack bar is going to be decreasing,

205
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:43,230
decreasing because you've got more calories for ice cream.

206
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:47,400
So you're getting all your calories per ice cream up to a point.

207
00:37:47,850 --> 00:38:00,290
And then and then at this point here at the end, the snack bars will reach a minimum.

208
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:12,180
So the ice number is zero here. And then you are reducing the total number of ice cream servings because they are too many, many, many, many calories.

209
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:23,489
You have to be tuned into the numbers so you can to satisfy the calorie constraints.

210
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:31,740
But that at this point, because, remember, you want to you want ice cream because you have the height is needed at this point.

211
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:41,460
You can but you can also contain the number of calories in look at the number of

212
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:46,319
the not number of calories in the ice cream and the ice cream just count to zero.

213
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:52,060
And that's your solution, you know, because all is not.

214
00:38:52,080 --> 00:39:02,640
But that's what we saw. And here, you know, this in the X values,

215
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:10,640
you see the calories per ice cream serving and in the in the inside of the here is the calories person not faster.

216
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:15,810
Right. So this is what's changing here from 80 to 200.

217
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:21,660
It's not bars and one 800 for ice cream.

218
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:31,710
And in the graph in the Y axis, what you are doing is projecting the optimal solution.

219
00:39:32,010 --> 00:39:42,660
Right, the optimal solution for the values that you're measuring in this case and measuring ice cream servings.

220
00:39:43,020 --> 00:40:02,090
And here I am measuring it's not bar servings that I could do if I wanted ice cream service to write to through here and get the ice cream servings.

221
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:12,820
And now we so this is a problem.

222
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:20,580
So these are going to be the number of ice cream servings that this is what you're promoting here.

223
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:28,410
When you change the calories per megabyte and this is the ice cream servings,

224
00:40:28,410 --> 00:40:40,410
when we change the calories for ice cream in your feets is one we are seeing the the if this is ice cream

225
00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:51,210
servings right I'm and I'm changing the calories per ice cream serving so the calories per snack bar.

226
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:59,549
I'm going to fix that to 120. And here is the calories per snack bar for serving.

227
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:04,820
So the calories for ice cream. The ice cream calories initially is how much?

228
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:09,240
160, 160. So I need 16 here.

229
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:26,900
That was your review that's from the Oreo was sending that speed when when you increase the calories ice cream how the ice cream serving.

230
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:34,130
Change when you freeze them out. You know, it's not like that's how the ice cream servings date.

231
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:38,270
And you can you know,

232
00:41:38,570 --> 00:41:50,320
as long as you remember that what you're wearing here is the calories per ice cream and what you are fixing here is the number of calories burned.

233
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:54,240
It's not like I'm so different volume.

234
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:58,400
It's not where you can see this graph showing what you are fixing here,

235
00:41:59,210 --> 00:42:04,130
but what you are bearing here is that kind of calories or is not part when you are fixing.

236
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:12,200
Here is the calories of ice cream. And then you have the the values of the ice cream servings that radio insurgency, you see,

237
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:20,650
want to know how the optimal solution changes instead of the bombs,

238
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:31,459
instead of the optimal solution of ice cream servings or or it's not about servings.

239
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:43,370
You want to make out of the ABC list and see, you know, how the total index changes when we change the calories for ice cream,

240
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:50,450
you know, keeping things the calories for ice, not birth.

241
00:42:50,790 --> 00:43:03,290
And here you'll see how the total taste index change when I vary the calories per night for kids to keep things they use for ice cream.

242
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:09,800
So you can play with these graph here.

243
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:26,670
You can actually get all the information that you need here and that it is not difficult to do that.

244
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:31,370
But there are so many variables, you might get confused.

245
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:44,600
Now, on Tuesday, next Tuesday, for extra credit, the only four people that are here in class, I'm going to give you a quiz about these.

246
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:51,079
So we're going to present you with this over the table and and you get this the table.

247
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:58,490
And then when I asked several questions and the questions are, okay, if you change these, what would be the time they value?

248
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:00,530
You read that table.

249
00:44:00,530 --> 00:44:13,790
And if you read the table, tell me what the value would be if I change this parameter to 160 or if I change these parameter to one point.

250
00:44:14,210 --> 00:44:22,280
So I'm going to give you a piece of paper. And then with that you have to do check, right?

251
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:28,170
And then you give me the piece of paper. So I know you are here and it's not to be.

252
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:35,720
So I'm not going to penalize people for not being here, but I'm going to give you a start for weeks.

253
00:44:37,110 --> 00:44:42,770
So it's the extra credit based on like trying or is it an accuracy or accuracy?

254
00:44:43,370 --> 00:44:46,490
Okay. You had to you had to be here. You had to do it.

255
00:44:48,710 --> 00:44:57,530
And I'm bringing people that are not here, but don't get a zero start to handle everything round and zero.

256
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:06,709
And you make suggestions on how to make sure that this is running well and backs because it's now working on my back at all like this actually solver.

257
00:45:06,710 --> 00:45:09,680
It didn't work online. I, I just had to go on the virtual seminar.

258
00:45:10,010 --> 00:45:16,100
I don't know why because it like wants me to like click yes like 300 times to run every single individual solver.

259
00:45:18,190 --> 00:45:25,550
So one thing that you can do is all the markets are having the same problem.

260
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:30,320
Okay, let me let me check because, you know,

261
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:41,360
the Solberg table is written in Visual Basic and I designed microscopes have been developing with Visual Basic for four months.

262
00:45:42,470 --> 00:45:45,040
So you're not going to be penalized for that,

263
00:45:46,070 --> 00:45:58,420
but you can always use a real spiritual love I'm use it from you so and people in the last week or so start windows machine so you can log in.

264
00:45:59,150 --> 00:46:04,390
Now on on Tuesday you are not going to have to run anything.

265
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,800
So, you know, give it everything. Run for you.

266
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:19,669
All you have to do take a look at the paper. I'm sorry about the the issue is running through not so I they told me that

267
00:46:19,670 --> 00:46:25,940
they were working on a solution for each of those are developers and they are.

268
00:46:29,030 --> 00:46:33,110
They're finding a solution for them.

269
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:41,380
For Maxwell. I'm going to check with him that nothing is wrong for us.

270
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:56,290
All right. So play with this because it's going to be important.

271
00:46:58,850 --> 00:47:04,160
So we did that. So with this is this is this is fine.

272
00:47:04,730 --> 00:47:09,980
So all I need is this graph first.

273
00:47:10,070 --> 00:47:14,000
So there's no questions to answer.

274
00:47:14,390 --> 00:47:17,450
So just produce these.

275
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:29,950
Run this on 30. Okay.

276
00:47:31,090 --> 00:47:45,670
How about between 2000? AP.

277
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:56,250
We the. Generally.

278
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:12,910
It worked last night for me. It's not working.

279
00:48:15,930 --> 00:48:34,200
That's what I'm saying is. So have you guys thought about what these classes are going to take next semester to go with a bang or,

280
00:48:34,610 --> 00:48:39,580
you know, very good classes in business school,

281
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:59,560
in public policy here, and working across the school district and and in the Department of Learning Health Sciences, also, we have good courses.

282
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:07,230
So anything I think that is data analytics is very useful for you.

283
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:12,900
I mean, of course you can do anything on have or something else.

284
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,890
Marketing is not in class or marketing is important.

285
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:21,120
We don't have a marketing plan here.

286
00:49:21,130 --> 00:49:37,860
And I think even thinking about health marketing and getting the curriculum and marketing for health services and administration,

287
00:49:37,870 --> 00:49:42,990
but that's I think that that's I think a strategy marketing strategy is very important.

288
00:49:45,870 --> 00:49:59,310
So there are a lot of useful classes. And I don't think at this point in development thinking 83 GPA because in a few years if you go to tourism,

289
00:49:59,550 --> 00:50:04,290
people are not going to really look at your GPA on the net.

290
00:50:04,290 --> 00:50:11,639
You want to go to doctoral program and then they look at your you and what is

291
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:18,960
not going to work in the industry that long as you graduate and great speed,

292
00:50:19,650 --> 00:50:30,810
you're not going to make any distinction between the 3.5 or 40.1 if you have all eight classes and that is.

293
00:50:31,770 --> 00:50:47,100
But you are not raising yourself and not getting challenged, just being in a GPA that I know that is not going to mean very much to you.

294
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:51,950
That's all right. Okay.

295
00:50:51,960 --> 00:51:07,750
So let's get. I thought that I was going to be able to teach the second hour of operations.

296
00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:13,260
Researchers focus on processing elation, and so is queuing simulations.

297
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:19,600
And you can see a plan and you can see people and resources and you can change.

298
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:29,100
These are these are the flow of patients here or these is a flow of information here that they go and how we go and so on.

299
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:33,940
But I have two problems.

300
00:51:34,270 --> 00:51:40,330
The first part of is there's going to be a wait, so that's not going to be feasible.

301
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:55,950
So sorry about that. But I am designing a course in analytics for policy analysis.

302
00:51:57,120 --> 00:52:03,120
So for those of you who are in the intersection of monetary policy,

303
00:52:04,210 --> 00:52:23,190
you see how taxes can change or implication can change access to wealth, and you have to own the system.

304
00:52:23,190 --> 00:52:41,910
Views of the thing is how the population views about their own strategy on how to incorporate what we call healthy knowledge.

305
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:58,750
All these these really fundamental societal fundamentals in, you know, interact to create a healthier environment or healthy environment.

306
00:52:58,770 --> 00:53:01,890
And that's the second announcement last night.

307
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:11,760
I mean, what do each based on system they need more simulation.

308
00:53:12,030 --> 00:53:19,950
Okay. So let's get right if I go to.

309
00:53:30,630 --> 00:53:50,860
Was. And.

310
00:54:09,490 --> 00:54:22,820
This magazine. You.

311
00:54:27,690 --> 00:54:55,850
Exactly. We want to make sure the panel is still working pretty closely.

312
00:54:58,850 --> 00:55:03,440
Yeah. Still. Good.

313
00:55:03,850 --> 00:55:23,030
So let me go to Simon singing and more thing and I want to so we did 330 about three setting for the team at 334 is about.

314
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:35,020
Okay, so let's, let's do 334 and I'm going to download the template.

315
00:55:51,550 --> 00:55:55,110
So he's going to read those reads like this.

316
00:56:06,250 --> 00:56:17,760
Okay. Let me move on. There are three factories on the Mumias Raider.

317
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:23,220
Each amends two types of pollutant labeled p1 p2 into the river.

318
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:27,089
If the weight, if the waste from each factory is processed,

319
00:56:27,090 --> 00:56:36,270
the pollution in the river is reduced because 1500 go to process in total factory one waste and each doing the process in the

320
00:56:36,310 --> 00:56:56,130
process reduce the amount of b 1.10 tons and the amount of B to a point 45 is done to 250 factory to 3000 and factory three way.

321
00:56:56,150 --> 00:57:08,840
So there are. So the idea is if you take a ton of waste from each one of the factory, it's going to take you different.

322
00:57:09,990 --> 00:57:23,610
You know, it's going to cost you differently. Right. And if you whenever you reduce it, whenever you take one ton from factory one,

323
00:57:24,450 --> 00:57:37,670
then the pollutant in the river are reduced and pollutant one is reduced by ten tons and put it 2.45, Don, for every plant weight.

324
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:43,850
So you you don't have control over the proportions, right?

325
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:47,640
So for every ton of weight, you reduce point ten.

326
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:59,760
Point 45 will be more than P2 for every tons of weight in time put in to give to these people to the point to reduce to be 1.25, 42 and so on.

327
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:08,969
The states want to reduce the amount of P1 in the river by at least 125 times the amount of P2.

328
00:58:08,970 --> 00:58:17,400
But at least 175 don't use silver to determine how to minimize the costs of reducing pollution by the entire amount.

329
00:58:17,790 --> 00:58:23,420
Are there be some proportionality, indivisibility, reason?

330
00:58:23,430 --> 00:58:32,170
All of these problem? Yes, they are right. So the only wasting is, you know, you can do it.

331
00:58:32,190 --> 00:58:47,080
You can, you know, take fractions too many and, you know, subdivide or or partition amount of a ton of waste into any fraction that are longer.

332
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:55,380
So that's fine. But you say yes, so let's do that first and then they will solve it, keep it.

333
00:58:55,860 --> 00:59:02,760
So now that should be quite simple.

334
00:59:03,660 --> 00:59:09,250
I to have a template. So we're going to create a template, right?

335
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:27,190
And then see. So we get the the data is the first thing we need to put on top so we can be able to change that later.

336
00:59:27,190 --> 00:59:30,790
So what, what is the data that we need?

337
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:42,730
So that's that's the data. So we need to create a table that for fact 31532, one, three, three.

338
00:59:45,730 --> 00:59:49,719
So what, what's the, the price per remove?

339
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:54,280
What is the amount of you want and the amount to that you reduce.

340
00:59:54,290 --> 01:00:00,620
Right. So this thing that. Three.

341
01:00:08,190 --> 01:00:15,520
To. Three.

342
01:00:15,530 --> 01:00:24,500
Three. But the.

343
01:00:31,130 --> 01:00:42,970
Cost. So everything's going to be different.

344
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:48,550
So it would cost.

345
01:00:56,590 --> 01:01:00,049
And day. He won.

346
01:01:00,050 --> 01:01:09,410
We got him. And between redemption.

347
01:01:20,130 --> 01:01:28,390
So. So they'll have my removal clause and then.

348
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:38,280
To write anywhere from.

349
01:01:57,590 --> 01:02:02,910
Each. You.

350
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:30,570
You. Okay.

351
01:02:31,020 --> 01:02:36,030
So now we move our responsibilities going to our people.

352
01:02:46,150 --> 01:02:50,860
1520 503,000 1525.

353
01:02:53,050 --> 01:03:03,190
1520 503,003.

354
01:03:07,380 --> 01:03:19,970
And David here. We did 2.1 in 2014 and 2014.

355
01:03:29,750 --> 01:03:38,080
If anyone is 45, 25, 50.

356
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:46,850
And then what?

357
01:03:50,810 --> 01:04:07,120
Okay, so there's no money on these accounts, right?

358
01:04:07,330 --> 01:04:11,170
So let me use things to this woman's.

359
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:36,000
Right now. I have. I'm going to make it blue.

360
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:40,790
Remember that? Those sort. Those are parameters.

361
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:50,720
Target was her input. Right. All right, so what what are you going to be my decision variables here or these?

362
01:04:51,740 --> 01:04:55,190
What are these? So I want to reduce.

363
01:04:57,410 --> 01:05:00,590
I want to minimize costs. Right. I have some constraints.

364
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:10,069
I want to reduce certain amount of pollutants in p one and peak two of the river.

365
01:05:10,070 --> 01:05:16,970
So right now, my my linens, they have to be reduced by at least three kind of money at the minimum.

366
01:05:18,110 --> 01:05:21,620
So what do you think? I mean, this issue that.

367
01:05:31,790 --> 01:05:45,770
Which factory you're going to do and how much waste for each factory you'll try to remove, how much waste from each factory you're going to remove.

368
01:05:46,700 --> 01:05:53,100
So you can not say, I'm going to remove that many that which one from the tractor you got one,

369
01:05:53,510 --> 01:05:58,580
two from the factory because they are tied directly to the amount of removal.

370
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:06,620
Right. So you've got your decision is how many pounds, how many tones I'm going to get from factory one,

371
01:06:06,620 --> 01:06:10,160
how many times they do it, how many times the factory three.

372
01:06:10,610 --> 01:06:18,139
And you need to do the math to make sure that when you get this amount from three, one, two and three,

373
01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:27,340
you're removing the amount of B1 helping to overall from the rework that included the ones into it.

374
01:06:27,380 --> 01:06:40,840
So what we need to do is we want and.

375
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:47,180
Excuse 31 to be too uncomfortable.

376
01:06:54,720 --> 01:07:11,470
So those are going to be my decision. Very. Let's say that I'm going to remove £10 for each 5315.1 523 goes to.

377
01:07:14,410 --> 01:07:25,930
So I know that then I have to demonstrate right from the train news that the amount I remove and what I'm going to get on you remove from,

378
01:07:25,930 --> 01:07:41,970
for instance two. And they have to be greater uncertainty in the world and.

379
01:07:55,740 --> 01:08:08,430
Since dating in which he won an award for leading one.

380
01:08:12,170 --> 01:08:19,770
Reason to. It's.

381
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:30,030
Here. We went to the moon.

382
01:08:38,830 --> 01:08:58,530
They the minimum require you know that to the moon and has to be greater than or equal to the minimum amount required.

383
01:09:04,110 --> 01:09:21,720
What does it mean for you? And 1.25 I'm 75 here one when you live and one's life and those being influenced.

384
01:09:32,470 --> 01:09:38,110
1:25 a.m. 175 influence how so?

385
01:09:38,110 --> 01:09:53,979
How much? Polluter one removing how many tons of one and two I'm going to pollute that one is going to be then Tom's right of waste times

386
01:09:53,980 --> 01:10:11,050
be the the polluting one removal alone remove for Tom right so those so that's going to be there and so there's going to be one,

387
01:10:11,650 --> 01:10:15,120
two, three, four, he said.

388
01:10:15,130 --> 01:10:27,980
And so with this I we're going to be removing seven points of pollutant one and so on and 4.5, 2.57.

389
01:10:28,030 --> 01:10:33,030
Right. And the evidence five, 12.1, two.

390
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:38,799
But there's two things in a more systematic way.

391
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:58,790
So you get some. Moved by this issue that goes on in the news.

392
01:11:02,130 --> 01:11:07,330
Remove the removal of the one and then the second one.

393
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:16,690
This may have vertical uses, for example, here and can characterize as a as we something else with Excel.

394
01:11:16,700 --> 01:11:22,120
But it's easier just to retract it from here.

395
01:11:22,210 --> 01:11:39,300
So the fact that it's being removed from 1 to 3 times a week to relocate, we're done with it.

396
01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:44,950
Okay, now so we have.

397
01:11:45,370 --> 01:11:52,480
You want to do one then.

398
01:11:53,620 --> 01:12:02,690
What? What, what am I missing? So it'll cost.

399
01:12:17,460 --> 01:12:28,920
Because one of the main things in this is going to be to some.

400
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:42,980
The amount removal is. The removal was profound.

401
01:12:46,910 --> 01:12:59,220
This is $70,000.

402
01:12:59,390 --> 01:13:03,890
What I have here is with that reunion.

403
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:17,660
Is my objective function. These groups are the calculations for political strength.

404
01:13:20,660 --> 01:13:26,390
Obviously, we qualify. All right, so what I'm.

405
01:13:26,450 --> 01:13:33,120
What I want to do now is minimize costs subject to these constraints.

406
01:13:33,140 --> 01:13:37,130
Very important to the.

407
01:13:39,550 --> 01:13:58,810
So very. I want to minimize cars that are subject to sort of like changing the terms of a factory

408
01:13:58,810 --> 01:14:05,890
when it wants to be moving and subject to the constraint that they have not removed,

409
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:17,469
or we want them to be greater than or equal to the minimum workmen and to make the complex

410
01:14:17,470 --> 01:14:24,690
straight variables not going to be negatively constraints and kinks important to the same place.

411
01:14:26,710 --> 01:14:45,230
So if you look closely and I either remove anything from factory two and then you get one, this is the leader you're going.

412
01:14:49,310 --> 01:15:05,790
I was with. So 57.7 tons of, in fact, 31.

413
01:15:07,050 --> 01:15:12,540
Nothing. In fact, we do. And 80 tons, in fact, 23.

414
01:15:13,050 --> 01:15:18,010
And the total cost is going to be $180,000, 369.

415
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:31,980
And so that's that's my ultimate solution. And then the question is how this optimal solution would change if my requirements were change.

416
01:15:31,990 --> 01:15:37,920
That means if I set minimum requirements, I regulations will change.

417
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:40,350
So let's see what exactly they're asking.

418
01:15:43,300 --> 01:15:50,330
I would use Silver Table to investigate the effect of increases in the minimum reduction requirement in state,

419
01:15:50,660 --> 01:15:56,360
especially see what happens to the amount of waste processed through a factory and the total cost

420
01:15:56,390 --> 01:16:02,930
imposed requirement is currently 1.5 and 175 respectively are increased by the same percentage.

421
01:16:04,010 --> 01:16:15,020
So revise your models the use of a table to investigate these changes with the percentage increase varying from 10% to 100% in increments of 10%,

422
01:16:15,530 --> 01:16:19,220
so 10 to 100 through 10%.

423
01:16:20,510 --> 01:16:23,680
So is that a one way paper tweaking?

424
01:16:27,750 --> 01:16:35,610
How many independent variables do we have do or parameter that we have to change in my opinion from.

425
01:16:39,900 --> 01:16:46,620
What is the percentage by which I increase the minimum requirement?

426
01:16:47,190 --> 01:16:50,639
So so this is a one way table.

427
01:16:50,640 --> 01:17:01,230
So the way in which we do this is I'm going to create another scale and I'm going to call this percentage increase.

428
01:17:15,540 --> 01:17:20,510
What percentage increase? I'm going to put this here.

429
01:17:20,900 --> 01:17:29,970
They say that percentage increase in 0%. The percentage increase in.

430
01:17:32,670 --> 01:17:40,970
She is a the takeover is an input variable, but it's not the same in.

431
01:17:41,340 --> 01:17:53,159
Sorry. It's been employed very well. It's not the same as we don't live here because these are used for sensitivity analysis.

432
01:17:53,160 --> 01:18:00,270
It's not a decision variable because it's just what is this imposed to me?

433
01:18:01,230 --> 01:18:10,290
I would guess that, you know, out of everything that we have done, this should be looked more like given the.

434
01:18:10,770 --> 01:18:19,050
So if I increase by 1% anything increase by 2%, those are equals in close to this one.

435
01:18:19,060 --> 01:18:23,840
So I'm going to win. That's it.

436
01:18:26,370 --> 01:18:29,370
And then for the minimum required.

437
01:18:29,900 --> 01:18:38,120
I'm just simply going to form and multiply these times.

438
01:18:40,500 --> 01:18:44,010
One those percentage increase.

439
01:18:47,600 --> 01:19:09,160
Through three. Groups equal to 125 rooms, wounding 72 women.

440
01:19:13,690 --> 01:19:27,530
So this is equal to 0%. Used to work in the old world.

441
01:19:29,980 --> 01:19:36,910
The percentage increase they can and they will stay the course.

442
01:19:36,940 --> 01:19:49,630
And to repeat it, 14 inches numbers, which is a good number.

443
01:19:55,200 --> 01:20:06,460
And we give you one this year. And then these women to be equal and the be one times or 1.5 times.

444
01:20:06,580 --> 01:20:10,450
So 1 billion times in Soviet times.

445
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:22,950
Then this is going to be 175 times one day percentage increase.

446
01:20:25,680 --> 01:20:29,270
This is giving you more.

447
01:20:32,430 --> 01:20:46,919
Okay. So now if my input changed to increase this by 30%, so 33%, then I can tell you what it becomes.

448
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:51,090
So going again and again and again is this time.

449
01:20:51,630 --> 01:20:57,750
So you have to do this by yourself to solve the table.

450
01:20:58,110 --> 01:21:01,890
And the only parameter that you need to change is this one.

451
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:05,790
And then is that 53.

452
01:21:05,970 --> 01:21:16,050
The percentage increase with low varies from 10% to 100% in increments of 10%.

453
01:21:16,710 --> 01:21:27,010
You know, show me how we do that. And I will tell you in 10 minutes or less than 10 minutes with next time.

454
01:21:28,710 --> 01:21:44,050
On paper and it is a large you see growing growing difficult classes going on here.

455
01:21:51,750 --> 01:21:58,770
So you definitely know what it's like.

456
01:21:58,770 --> 01:22:03,680
Well, it's just not that a little bit.

457
01:22:04,150 --> 01:22:23,690
You know, you if I saw one thing that I about this in the pipeline to say I mean it has worked and that's

458
01:22:23,710 --> 01:22:36,110
the beginning of the semester only because people usually just like a lot of people like you.

459
01:22:37,010 --> 01:22:52,440
So I said my contacts are so busy, so I was so messed up.

460
01:22:52,440 --> 01:23:05,100
So I posted online. So it's ideas about ideas like you said that people are going to find out that.

461
01:23:05,240 --> 01:23:10,290
But I don't necessarily want to go with you, honestly.

462
01:23:11,670 --> 01:23:25,560
Let's go. See you guys.

463
01:23:27,570 --> 01:23:36,180
Yeah, right. Thank you.

464
01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:41,820
Maybe I'll just keep this one out.

465
01:23:42,510 --> 01:24:04,540
Oh, my God. I'm actually taking myself to the.

466
01:24:42,740 --> 01:24:45,410
On Outlook next.
