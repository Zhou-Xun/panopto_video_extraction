00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:11,090
Welcome back to this two-part podcast series on climate change, air quality and environmental justice in Detroit.

2
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:17,000
In the last episode, we explored how climate change worsens air quality and hurts our lungs.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,650
We also learned how a heavy concentration of manufacturing and trans national highway

4
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:27,860
traffic in southwest Detroit have caused high levels of air pollution and high asthma rates.

5
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:35,330
Finally, we touched on the unequal burden of pollution and poor health in communities of color within Detroit.

6
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:41,030
Today, we will explore this environmental injustice a little further than talk about concrete

7
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:46,250
steps that the city of Detroit can take to move toward environmental justice.

8
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:54,950
First, what is environmental justice? The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency gives us a handy definition.

9
00:00:54,950 --> 00:01:01,430
They state that environmental justice is the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people,

10
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:06,170
regardless of race, color, national origin or income.

11
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:14,690
With respect to the development, implementation and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations and policies.

12
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:23,930
Furthermore, they say this goal will be achieved when everyone enjoys the same degree of protection from an environmental and health hazards,

13
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:32,150
and equal access to the decision making process to have a healthy environment in which to live, learn and work.

14
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:39,680
So do we have environmental justice in the city of Detroit so far, all signs point to no.

15
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:46,760
Last episode we talked about Michigan's most toxic zip code four eight two one seven in Southwest Detroit.

16
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:55,160
This is a community that is predominantly black, low income and surrounded by more than two dozen major industrial facilities.

17
00:01:55,160 --> 00:02:02,750
EPA Air Quality reports show that this area of Detroit has the highest concentration of sulfur dioxide,

18
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:11,930
a major air pollutant produced by burning coal. This exposure to high levels of sulfur dioxide is estimated to cost anywhere between

19
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:20,060
6000 to 26000 extra asthma attacks per year in children living in southwest Detroit.

20
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:26,000
Those existing policies and rule enforcements in Detroit are not protecting four eight two one

21
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:39,200
seven from environmental and health hazards to the same degree as other communities in Michigan.

22
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:48,950
So what can be done to move towards environmental justice? First, representation, representation, representation.

23
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:59,680
The EPA. He says that all people should have meaningful involvement from development to enforcement of environmental policies.

24
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:06,460
The city of Detroit made a meaningful first step when they developed their plan for their Detroit climate strategy,

25
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:11,410
a comprehensive planning process for community climate resilience.

26
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:16,390
They made a commitment to an inclusive planning process to ensure an equitable,

27
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:22,720
climate resilient strategy for Detroit's communities of color to be hosted by Eco Works,

28
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:28,420
a trusted community organization centered on climate equity and sustainable development.

29
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:33,100
However, this process was derailed by the COVID 19 pandemic.

30
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:42,190
Now it's time to get the ball rolling again and give Detroit's most affected residents a stake in the development of this climate plan.

31
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:50,230
Next, the city of Detroit must commit to measures to rapidly reduce air pollution in southwest Detroit.

32
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:58,300
Such measures should include increased enforcement and monitoring of air pollution controls for industrial facilities,

33
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:08,350
like using cleaner fuels, which produce fewer pollutants and maintaining scrubbers to trap pollutants before they are released into the air.

34
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:18,450
The city should also require facilities to move rapidly to renewable energy sources such as solar power, which emit no carbon pollution.

35
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:23,640
Much of the air pollution from transnational traffic occurs while vehicles are idling.

36
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:29,340
Detroit police need to step up enforcement of existing anti idling ordinances.

37
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:35,130
Finally, for homes and schools that are located near industrial facilities and highways,

38
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:40,350
the city of Detroit needs to require the installation and maintenance of air filters in

39
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:46,650
planting of vegetation buffers to reduce the amount of air pollution that seeps indoors.

40
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:55,744
We all deserve clean air and the ability to breathe easy. Let's work together to make this a reality for all Detroiters.
