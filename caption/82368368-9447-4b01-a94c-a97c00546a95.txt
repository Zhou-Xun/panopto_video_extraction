1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:06,612
Hey, everyone, I'll be going over the pentose phosphate shunt or

2
00:00:06,612 --> 00:00:10,650
pentose phosphate pathway at the moment.

3
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:13,320
So, quickly skimming through of course.

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:18,679
First, we're gonna talk about oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species,

5
00:00:18,679 --> 00:00:22,250
and maybe their advantages and how they're formed.

6
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:28,124
So, definitely, there's some adaptations as mentioned earlier on the TCA cycle.

7
00:00:28,124 --> 00:00:32,380
When someone trains a lot, their mitochondria multiply and

8
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:34,900
they form multiple mitochondria.

9
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:39,784
This is to help them cope with their excess energy needs because they

10
00:00:39,784 --> 00:00:44,421
can only undergo the TCA cycle and the ATC and the mitochondria.

11
00:00:44,421 --> 00:00:49,100
So more mitochondria would equate to being able to make more energy.

12
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,878
On another note, when someone is training a lot,

13
00:00:51,878 --> 00:00:56,842
they're more prone to build up oxidative stress just because they're, technically,

14
00:00:56,842 --> 00:00:59,171
you're putting your body under stress.

15
00:00:59,171 --> 00:01:01,271
So it's just makes more oxidative stress.

16
00:01:01,271 --> 00:01:04,660
And the body is smart enough to come up with a way to combat that.

17
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:12,211
And that way is by having mitochondrial SOD2 which is SOD activity.

18
00:01:12,211 --> 00:01:15,940
I believe I may have gotten ahead of myself but I'll keep going.

19
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:21,002
So, the mitochondrial SOD activity will allow the mitochondria

20
00:01:21,002 --> 00:01:25,990
to get rid of oxidative stress that's being built up inside it.

21
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:30,416
And this is definitely important, here we go,

22
00:01:30,416 --> 00:01:35,836
because as you train a lot or as you use your TCA cycle a lot,

23
00:01:35,836 --> 00:01:41,369
there is a chance that the oxygen that's the final electron

24
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:46,701
acceptor in the ATC cycle will get oxidized eventually.

25
00:01:46,701 --> 00:01:53,345
So, you need the SOD to remove the free radicals of oxygen and

26
00:01:53,345 --> 00:01:58,450
make hydrogen peroxide which is less active.

27
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:03,993
And you have in other systems other steps, eventually, GSH and

28
00:02:03,993 --> 00:02:09,665
GSSG which we'll be talking about, Very soon that will

29
00:02:09,665 --> 00:02:16,324
eventually make sure that everything is reduced and there is no oxidative damage.

30
00:02:16,324 --> 00:02:18,041
So, this is important.

31
00:02:18,041 --> 00:02:19,819
So, this is the training adaptations.

32
00:02:19,819 --> 00:02:22,655
Usually, as you're having more mitochondria,

33
00:02:22,655 --> 00:02:27,176
you'll have more SOD2 just because SOD2 is in the mitochondria and you need it

34
00:02:27,176 --> 00:02:31,790
to combat oxidative stress that's being increased due to increased training.

35
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:36,500
And this is the oxidative damage pre-training and post-training.

36
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,452
So, post-training, you've trained and

37
00:02:39,452 --> 00:02:43,051
now the SOD2 can't get rid of the oxidative damage.

38
00:02:43,051 --> 00:02:46,740
So, the oxidative damage is actually decreasing.

39
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:50,808
So, some studies with antioxidant vitamins have shown that

40
00:02:50,808 --> 00:02:55,594
supplementing a lot of antioxidants specifically like vitamin E, and

41
00:02:55,594 --> 00:03:00,535
vitamin C, and so on, they can actually limit the benefits of exercise by

42
00:03:00,535 --> 00:03:03,940
which the study was looking at glucose uptake.

43
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:07,170
And so glucose uptake usually should increase

44
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:10,152
post exercise because exercise allows for

45
00:03:10,152 --> 00:03:16,140
glut4 to be translocated into the membrane despite whether insulin is there or not.

46
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,410
And so it allows for more uptake of glucose.

47
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:23,065
But when they supplemented with high dosages of antioxidants,

48
00:03:23,065 --> 00:03:27,372
this was not evident over here with vitamin C and vitamin E,

49
00:03:27,372 --> 00:03:31,509
which means that maybe their active oxidative species,

50
00:03:31,509 --> 00:03:35,644
the oxidative stress by itself was necessary to allow for

51
00:03:35,644 --> 00:03:40,140
the advantages of exercise to be evident over here.

52
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,610
So, just food for thought.

53
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:45,816
Another thing that's important over here is the SOD2 variants.

54
00:03:45,816 --> 00:03:49,140
So, SOD2 as mentioned, it's in the mitochondria,

55
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:52,640
helps fight off mitochondrial oxidative stress.

56
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,851
And there is an alanine-alanine variant which

57
00:03:57,851 --> 00:04:02,802
makes your SOD too very highly functional and

58
00:04:02,802 --> 00:04:09,860
works better than if you have a valine-alanine polymorphism.

59
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:14,847
And finally, if you have a valine-valine on the two chromosomes,

60
00:04:14,847 --> 00:04:17,921
then this will decrease SOD2 activity.

61
00:04:17,921 --> 00:04:22,928
And this is why when we're looking at the top level, athletes over here and

62
00:04:22,928 --> 00:04:27,937
then other athletes, we see that there's a higher percentage of athletes

63
00:04:27,937 --> 00:04:33,504
who have the alanine-alanine just because it definitely puts them at an advantage

64
00:04:33,504 --> 00:04:38,390
of performing better because they can alleviate the oxidative stress.

65
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:43,118
Which means, if you can keep alleviating it, then your mitochondria can keep going

66
00:04:43,118 --> 00:04:47,340
through the TCA cycle without having the burden of oxidative stress.

67
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:51,850
So, you can make more energy as compared to someone who might have

68
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:57,940
the valine-valine polymorphism and does have a lower SOD2 activity.

69
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:00,531
So now an advantage to the reactive oxidative species.

70
00:05:00,531 --> 00:05:04,650
So, you can actually use them in your immune system to make

71
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:07,780
a respiratory burst or an oxidative burst.

72
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:12,209
So, basically, if there is bacteria that you wanna fight off in your body,

73
00:05:12,209 --> 00:05:14,909
just your immune system wants to get rid of it,

74
00:05:14,909 --> 00:05:18,252
it's gonna need a lot of NADPH which is the reduced form.

75
00:05:18,252 --> 00:05:23,517
And then it's gonna oxidize it, and so you're left with NADP+.

76
00:05:23,517 --> 00:05:28,230
And all the oxidized, Oxidized particles,

77
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:34,828
all the electrons are gonna be burst into the area that engulfs the bacteria so

78
00:05:34,828 --> 00:05:39,311
that the bacteria can't really live off anything.

79
00:05:39,311 --> 00:05:43,118
The bacteria is now surrounded by oxidative species and

80
00:05:43,118 --> 00:05:45,391
this makes the bacteria die off.

81
00:05:45,391 --> 00:05:48,187
So, to be able to fight off some bacteria,

82
00:05:48,187 --> 00:05:56,140
your immune cells are gonna need a lot of NADPH to do that.

83
00:05:56,140 --> 00:06:01,633
[COUGH] So, now, some molecules that are susceptible to oxidative damage.

84
00:06:01,633 --> 00:06:07,927
Definitely DNA especially with aging, some proteins because they just break as well.

85
00:06:07,927 --> 00:06:13,342
And lipids because polyunsaturated fatty acids that have double bond and

86
00:06:13,342 --> 00:06:18,941
multiple double bonds, they're more at risk of having oxidation in them.

87
00:06:18,941 --> 00:06:23,645
And this is how you have an unsaturated lipid over here and

88
00:06:23,645 --> 00:06:25,910
then a hydrogen over here.

89
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:30,605
HO, I mean that's that has an a radical, a free radical on it.

90
00:06:30,605 --> 00:06:35,084
Then that's radical propagate to the lipid causing a lipid

91
00:06:35,084 --> 00:06:38,756
radical that eventually becomes a paroxyl, and

92
00:06:38,756 --> 00:06:43,251
then a peroxide which is less active than a liquid radical.

93
00:06:43,251 --> 00:06:49,840
But this is still not ideal, you wanna not have oxidation to begin with.

94
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,498
So, some antioxidants, definitely vitamin E, and vitamin C.

95
00:06:53,498 --> 00:06:55,128
Selenium is just a cofactor for

96
00:06:55,128 --> 00:06:59,503
glutathione peroxidase which we'll talk about in a bit.

97
00:06:59,503 --> 00:07:04,877
So, some antioxidants also like a peon lutein,

98
00:07:04,877 --> 00:07:11,140
there are good sources of antioxidants as well.

99
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,741
And now the pentose phosphate pathway.

100
00:07:13,741 --> 00:07:16,240
So, basically, this is how the system works.

101
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,630
You have some oxidative stress, it becomes reduced.

102
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:26,960
You use up your reduced glutathione, it becomes oxidized.

103
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,524
And then the oxidized glutathione will require NADPH,

104
00:07:31,524 --> 00:07:35,613
which is in a reduced form to reduce it back to GSH.

105
00:07:35,613 --> 00:07:41,940
And then the NADPH will become NADP.

106
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:46,199
[COUGH] So, glucose is needed to charge this system because,

107
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:49,714
remember, this figure from previous lectures.

108
00:07:49,714 --> 00:07:54,930
Basically, you need glucose to go through the pentose phosphate pathway.

109
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:58,060
If you do not have glucose, you can't really undergo this pathway.

110
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:04,640
So, it's crucial that the body is not starved and has sufficient glucose.

111
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,698
So let's talk a bit about favism.

112
00:08:06,698 --> 00:08:11,443
Some people have deficiencies in the glucose-6 RA dehydrogen enzyme,

113
00:08:11,443 --> 00:08:15,440
which means that they can truly undergo the PPS efficiently.

114
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,694
So they're at risk of having more oxidative stress build up because they

115
00:08:19,694 --> 00:08:23,940
can't reproduce NADPH to combat that build up of oxidative stress.

116
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:29,856
So, if those people eat fava beans or legumes in general that

117
00:08:29,856 --> 00:08:35,076
usually have some high oxidative potential in them,

118
00:08:35,076 --> 00:08:41,456
then they can have hemolysis because the oxidative potential and

119
00:08:41,456 --> 00:08:46,560
the legumes cannot be reduced by NADPH because those

120
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:51,432
people might not have enough NADPH being produced

121
00:08:51,432 --> 00:08:55,620
because they have a deficiency in G6PDH.

122
00:08:55,620 --> 00:09:01,227
So, interestingly, this has proven to be somehow beneficial

123
00:09:01,227 --> 00:09:06,831
to people who live in areas that might be prone to have malaria,

124
00:09:06,831 --> 00:09:11,802
because it seems that if they can't make enough NADPH,

125
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:15,641
then malaria can't really survive well.

126
00:09:15,641 --> 00:09:19,750
So, it's proven to be good evolutionary adaptation.

127
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:24,940
Then again, since those people do live in areas that really have high malaria,

128
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:28,358
they're sometimes given the vaccine for malaria.

129
00:09:28,358 --> 00:09:32,382
And the vaccine by itself has a lot of oxidative potential so

130
00:09:32,382 --> 00:09:38,940
this kind of backfires.

131
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:43,980
So, the products of the PPS, NADPH of course which is an antioxidant.

132
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:47,812
Also ribose sugars which is really important for

133
00:09:47,812 --> 00:09:51,736
someone who needs rapidly dividing cells like for

134
00:09:51,736 --> 00:09:56,595
example infants, or someone who's been through a trauma and

135
00:09:56,595 --> 00:10:02,340
needs to regenerate a lot of cells like a burn patient, and so on.

136
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,641
So, fatty acids require a lot of NADPH.

137
00:10:04,641 --> 00:10:10,189
So over here to make one palmitate which is a C16, you will need 14 NADPH.

138
00:10:10,189 --> 00:10:17,240
So, basically, you need 7 glucose molecules to be able to make this.

139
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:23,240
So, you need 7 acetyl CoA over here.

140
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,442
So, the regulation,

141
00:10:24,442 --> 00:10:28,367
the first step is really almost the only step that's being regulated over

142
00:10:28,367 --> 00:10:32,380
here which is the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, that G6PDH.

143
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:36,406
So, basically, if you have NADP,

144
00:10:36,406 --> 00:10:42,312
then this is the oxidized form, then it will trigger

145
00:10:42,312 --> 00:10:47,840
G6PDH to make more NADPH to be able to reduce it.

146
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:52,526
And also if you have a build up of glucose-6-phosphate,

147
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:57,398
it really means that you really have a lot of reactants that can

148
00:10:57,398 --> 00:11:00,610
go into this pathway and this reaction.

149
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:05,980
So, it's a good time to increase the activity of G6PDH.

150
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:10,291
Also, it's inhibited by high levels of NADPH which makes sense because if you've

151
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:18,840
made enough NADPH, you do not need to be making more.

152
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:24,420
So, this is, over here, this is a kinesmatic of how NADP would promote

153
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:30,290
its activity and G6-phosphate up here would also promote its activity.

154
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:35,540
But NADPH which is the final product would inactivate it.

155
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,197
So now for alcohol metabolism.

156
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:41,569
Alcohol metabolism, if someone drinks moderately, usually ethanol will be

157
00:11:41,569 --> 00:11:46,640
metabolized through ADH, and then ALDH, and then ACS to yield acetyl-CoA.

158
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,697
So, this really adds energy, and since acetyl-CoA is gonna feed

159
00:11:51,697 --> 00:11:56,848
into the whole cycle bypassing PFK1, and saturate regulation and

160
00:11:56,848 --> 00:12:01,091
so on, then it's just there adding energy to deliver,

161
00:12:01,091 --> 00:12:05,560
because that's where the alcohol is being metabolized.

162
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:09,019
But if someone is a chronic consumer, then there,

163
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:12,997
I believe that's where it is, let me check.

164
00:12:12,997 --> 00:12:20,275
Their sip to E1 would kick in instead of ADH if someone is a chronic consumer and

165
00:12:20,275 --> 00:12:26,781
has consumed a lot of alcohol, that F2E1 will be active over here and

166
00:12:26,781 --> 00:12:30,884
it will utilize a lot of NADPH and make NADH.

167
00:12:30,884 --> 00:12:36,297
So, this isn't good because if someone is a chronic consumer

168
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:42,441
then they're really utilizing NADPH to metabolize all the ethanol,

169
00:12:42,441 --> 00:12:46,918
which isn't shown here in case you're confused,

170
00:12:46,918 --> 00:12:51,220
it's not shown here, but it's in the handout.

171
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:56,350
So, this means that a person who's a chronic consumer will be utilizing

172
00:12:56,350 --> 00:13:01,313
all their antioxidative capacity in the liver to be able to metabolize

173
00:13:01,313 --> 00:13:06,527
ethanol which is just flooding into the liver putting the liver at risk and

174
00:13:06,527 --> 00:13:11,321
putting the liver at a situation where it can easily have a build up of

175
00:13:11,321 --> 00:13:16,830
oxidative stress due to the other functions that are occurring in the liver.

176
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:21,325
Which leads us to this figure over here by which some

177
00:13:21,325 --> 00:13:25,000
fat accumulation can occur in the liver.

178
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,496
And if your NADPH is being used up to deal with the chronic alcohol intake in

179
00:13:29,496 --> 00:13:32,324
the second pathway that's not shown in here,

180
00:13:32,324 --> 00:13:36,821
then your liver can't use the antioxidative capacity to combat any other

181
00:13:36,821 --> 00:13:39,961
oxidative stress because it's all being used up.

182
00:13:39,961 --> 00:13:45,080
So, this develops into NASH which is reversible if you do lifestyle changes.

183
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:50,988
But then if you go forward actually to cirrhosis, this is irreversible,

184
00:13:50,988 --> 00:13:57,313
it's an end stage liver disease and you need a liver transplant.

185
00:13:57,313 --> 00:14:01,911
And this is associating alcohol and all-cause mortality.

186
00:14:01,911 --> 00:14:05,040
So, the risk increases if you're consuming more than two drinks per day.

187
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:11,730
But even the evidence here might be controversial to some.

188
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:17,381
So, Weigh your pros and cons probably.

189
00:14:17,381 --> 00:14:20,578
And this is it.
