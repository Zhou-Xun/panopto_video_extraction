1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:05,700
I go to those? Yeah. It's good, isn't it?

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:10,360
It's not like I like it, but like, I don't know.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,760
Every day I don't see anything. So I would on other issues.

4
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:43,110
Oh yeah, I know. Something like that. Oh, I mean, like last time, like, I was like, you didn't get second, you know, I just as I was like, stop.

5
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,740
It's just not right. Yeah, I don't.

6
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:50,570
We don't last, you know, it's not worth the risk.

7
00:00:51,670 --> 00:01:01,620
I know. I was starting to think it's something else that everybody's energetic on a monday morning.

8
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:05,069
Appreciate that. All right.

9
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:08,729
So today we're going to shift gears a little bit to relax.

10
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:18,450
One of the assumptions that we've made so far, the theory that assumption is that people sort of know all the things, you know, to make them safe.

11
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:28,350
So our basic model is utility maximization. We started out with a simple world where there was no time, which is sort of one, one, one shot deal.

12
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:31,830
You got a certain amount of income, you faced certain prices.

13
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:39,300
How are you going to allocate your income in a way that makes you happy as long as you devise one look like that are all working one goals.

14
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:47,730
We talked a little bit about how we relax. One of those assumptions, the assumption that it's a one shot deal is no future.

15
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:54,330
You know, not how people might allocate their lifetime income across different time periods,

16
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:00,840
how you might borrow from your future self in order to be a student, how to invest your education.

17
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:06,690
And then your future self is going to have to save money for your future future retire itself.

18
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:15,030
So that person in the middle is sort of dealing with all three of your current student self.

19
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:20,670
You're working self and you're retired. So we talk a little bit about how well,

20
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:27,870
one of the things that we still have to make as a maintained assumption when we sort of built out that model a little bit to allow time,

21
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,970
is that you can use the things you would ideally want to know to make those decisions.

22
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:39,450
Oh, well, the stock market be really strong in the next 30 years or not, or you're saving for retirement.

23
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:47,100
You knew that they definitely influenced how much you're going to save for retirement or whether you put it in the stock market versus,

24
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:53,970
say, real estate. And also, I like to know something about your future health status.

25
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:59,430
What's your longevity is going to be? What's your state of wellness going to be into the future?

26
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:02,549
I feel very different about how much should save for retirement.

27
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:08,220
If I could tell you, you're guaranteed to live to be at least 100 versus you're guaranteed to live to be.

28
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:10,320
No, no, no longer that no older than 70.

29
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:18,000
You have a big impact on your retirement decisions in terms of when you want to retire and how much you want to save for retirement.

30
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:20,940
But those are things that we fundamentally don't know.

31
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:31,860
We have to make our best guesses, our best decisions about these important future events with only some maybe idea of what are the likelihoods?

32
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:37,710
And you might know something about your own health status. You might know something about your family health history.

33
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:45,720
Certainly could look at things like life tables and see sort of on average, how long do people like me live and.

34
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:55,139
But ultimately, you're going to have to make a guess. So today we're going to begin to see how consumers might deal with situations

35
00:03:55,140 --> 00:04:00,240
where they face some risk and there's some future information that is unknown.

36
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:06,900
But they have to make decisions today. It can't wait until that information is known to make their decisions.

37
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:13,290
You can't say, Oh, now that I've discovered I've lived to be 100, I sure wish I would have saved more for my retirement.

38
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:22,440
It's too late at that point. You have to make the decision now when you're still facing that fundamental risk or uncertainty in your life.

39
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:30,130
So we're trying to answer two basic questions here. Why do people generally dislike risky situations?

40
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:41,620
Is that the kind of say of what it is you're telling me so that would you rather know some of these things in the future?

41
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,040
Would you like to know how much the stock market was going to return in the next 30 years?

42
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:50,400
Yeah. You know, so I knew that I could make very different decisions.

43
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:53,590
I could probably make much better decisions than the ones I have to make.

44
00:04:53,950 --> 00:05:02,530
Only was a guess based on sort of historical performance norms and how that distribution plays out over time.

45
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:06,070
And then if we dislike risky situations, well,

46
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:14,760
what can we do to manage that in our lives and what can we do to either avoid those situations or at least reduce or mitigate the risks that we face?

47
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:22,340
Those are two big things we're trying to answer today. It's the first of its kind defined terms.

48
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:28,070
So risk and uncertainty are kind of so different economic concepts.

49
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:33,560
Risk is when you can fundamentally sort of calculate the situation you're in.

50
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:36,770
You understand the situation. You don't know what the outcome is going to be.

51
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:40,550
But you kind of understand the game you're playing.

52
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:49,460
The outcome is unknown, but you pretty well know what is the set of possible outcomes and what are the probabilities those different outcomes occur.

53
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:57,880
And so if I were to. Say they've ever bought a pick three lottery ticket.

54
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:03,410
It. Take three lottery tickets. Draw it every day.

55
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:10,550
It's a number between 000 and 999. So there's a thousand different and a thousand different numbers can come out

56
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:17,420
and you pay a dollar play and you win $500 if the number you pick comes up.

57
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:23,100
So that's a situation of pure risk. You understand the outcomes, the outcomes.

58
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,259
Every time that I'll lose a dollar or I'm going to win.

59
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:32,150
How much? Actually, 499. They don't give you the dollar back you bought the ticket for.

60
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:36,230
I mean, you're going to win $499 or I'm going to lose a dollar.

61
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:45,050
And what are the likelihood of that? What's the probability I'm going to win the four $99,000 one in a thousand?

62
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:51,680
So basically, I've got two possible outcomes, 99.9% of the time.

63
00:06:53,940 --> 00:07:02,780
My payoff is -$1. 1/10 of a percent of the time.

64
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:08,420
One in a thousand. I pay off as a gain of $499.

65
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:21,870
So if I do that math. I average pay off if I play that game is -$0.50, so I pay a dollar for the ticket on average.

66
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:28,020
I'm going to lose $0.50. So in a couple of ways I could deal with that risk.

67
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:32,310
We have one suggestion for how to deal with that risk.

68
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:41,480
I bought tickets to say goodbye to you, which will be called What if you verse ification?

69
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,319
You could diversify now in this case, diversification, or actually, I would argue,

70
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:53,780
be a horrible strategy because I could perfectly diversify to eliminate all the risk by buying a thousand tickets, one for each number,

71
00:07:54,740 --> 00:08:01,670
at which point I would guarantee that my thousand dollars has lost me exactly $500,

72
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:10,640
because I know for sure I'm holding one winning ticket and 999 losing tickets so I could diversify my risk by buying all the numbers.

73
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:15,229
But because this on average is a losing, that it's a 50 cent loss for every dollar,

74
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:19,969
I bet on average, I really don't want to diversify across a losing situation.

75
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:23,180
So I've got another more even easier option available.

76
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:30,200
Yeah. I asked you how many people have ever played this game and nobody raised it yet.

77
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:36,920
So this was a risk you could simply as walk away from. It's not inherent to your life that you must play this game.

78
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:42,800
You're like, Well, I have to save for my retirement and I don't know how long I'm going to live.

79
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:47,240
You can't avoid that. That's just a fact of life. This one's for you.

80
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,709
It's a losing bet on average.

81
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:56,420
And if you don't think it's sufficiently fun to play and say, Well, I could simply avoid that risk by walking away and not taking that,

82
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:59,780
that's a some resolution just walk away from you can not buy the lottery again.

83
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,499
You can say, well, that's a bad bet for every dollar, right?

84
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:07,760
That on average I will lose $0.50. I'm not interested.

85
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:13,040
I'm not going to play. Or he could do the really bad strategy of diversifying and buying a thousand tickets,

86
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:17,150
eliminate all the risk that way, but then you're going to lose $500 for sure.

87
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:23,070
You're better off just walking away. So this is a situation of pure risk.

88
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:30,240
You know exactly what the probabilities are and you exactly what the outcomes are that are attached to each of those probabilities.

89
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,160
So you can do that mathematical calculation. So that's pure risk.

90
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,820
You don't know the outcome. You don't know what number will be drawn,

91
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:45,120
so therefore you don't know whether you're going to be in the 99.9% of the time that you're

92
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,710
going to lose the dollar or the 1/10 of a percent of time that you're going to win for 99.

93
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:58,520
But you can count you can do all the calculations. There's also situations known as uncertainty.

94
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:05,780
Where even the set of possible outcomes or their probabilities are unknown.

95
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:10,250
So I think two great examples. One would be the COVID 19 pandemic.

96
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:15,890
Did we know before 2020 that it was possible that there could be a pandemic?

97
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:24,170
Yeah, of course. But did we know really what the probability was that that was going to occur in 2020?

98
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:30,290
Was there such historically rare events to have such major pandemics that, you know, I don't know.

99
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:35,390
Is it one in 100 because, well, the flu was 100 years ago or is it one in a thousand?

100
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:40,550
Is it one in 50? Is it one in ten? Because we have much more travel now than we had 100 years ago.

101
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:49,320
And what about the outcomes that I know how severe it was going to be? So I have a reasonable historical basis to say, well, you know,

102
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:58,160
pandemics like this one is going to occur once every 50 years and there is a 20% chance it's going to be as severe as the COVID 19 pandemic was.

103
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:05,330
And no, I couldn't. The best epidemiologists in the world could not have given you a reason in 2019,

104
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:13,250
could not have assessed a reasonable probability of the COVID 19 pandemic occurring in 2020 and its severity.

105
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:22,900
And we can't even look at the flu in 1917 as a much of an analog because medical care was very different that you can't even travel a little less.

106
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:29,330
Travel is different. Travel is much slower. People didn't travel as there wasn't international air travel.

107
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:37,400
You know, they could take or it could save any any new virus in the world is one plane trip away from anywhere else in the world.

108
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:43,800
But it wasn't true in 1970. So that was a situation of fundamental uncertainty.

109
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:49,799
We could not have written all this stuff down in 2019 about COVID 19 and say, Well,

110
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:56,190
here's the chance this is going to happen next year and here's the the distribution of likelihoods of severity.

111
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:06,450
911 attacks were another one. The day before that happened on 910, 2001, that was not in anybody's imagination.

112
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:12,629
So nobody could have really said a day earlier, well,

113
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:19,500
what's the probability that planes of know airliners are going to be hijacked and going to take down the World Trade Center?

114
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:30,550
What do you like? What are you talking about? Who were any pleased that they even imagined you on this,

115
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:40,920
like some prep school that they didn't know how much you forces in then and then the chances of getting one token or

116
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:50,360
dependent on that one person didn't make it and then you that among compete with that for many different things.

117
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:56,329
Right. It's just because they're going to give you a $500 prize but you pay a $1 price for the ticket.

118
00:12:56,330 --> 00:13:01,950
They don't refund your ticket price when you win. So that's why, again, the net gain is for 99.

119
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:08,450
If you win, you've won $499 because you paid a dollar to play the game and that amount of money is gone.

120
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:15,800
They're not refunding your ticket price. It's somebody had $45 that would be separate minus five of the five.

121
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:19,760
So it wouldn't work if somebody got five tickets.

122
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:23,510
So you had five tickets for different numbers than you would have.

123
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:36,600
3.995 chance of losing, but your loss would be $5 and you'd have 45, right.

124
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:40,880
For a 4.5. Okay, thanks.

125
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:50,760
Actually it was still B minus one.

126
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:57,110
You just of set either just changing the. Yeah.

127
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,280
Yeah. First, I hope you're right.

128
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:05,940
I think we should. We should do. So think of it as sort of one bet.

129
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:14,340
Now, I'm betting on five numbers. Instead of betting on one is I'm betting on five numbers and multiplies my probability of winning by five.

130
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,820
It decreases my probability of losing by a little bit.

131
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:27,930
But then my bet now is $5 to $5 loss in that I'm net if I if one of my numbers comes up I've won $495.

132
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:31,620
So that's exactly right. So that's how I would think of that bet.

133
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:36,780
So that's why in 5 to 5 different numbers so I'm going to play five times with different numbers.

134
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:41,610
I changed my probability of losing. It's now not quite as bad.

135
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:45,360
I've increased my probability of winning. Probability still have to sum to one.

136
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:50,909
But now I've made a $5 bet instead of a $1 bet.

137
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:56,910
So if I lose, I only losing now 99.5% of the time instead of 99.9.

138
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:01,379
But I losing $5 and now winning a half a percent of the time.

139
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:09,390
So a 10th of a percent of the time of my net winnings is for $500 prize minus the $5 I paid for five tickets.

140
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:17,670
So that would be the and that's still going to be on a per dollar bet basis.

141
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:23,009
You're still going to lose $0.50. So that should be like going negative to 50 on average.

142
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:37,020
My $5 bet is losing $2.50. I'm losing half my money on average, and that's how much you are losing is on top of working for me like that.

143
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:40,560
But even half of what you owe in this game. In this game. Right?

144
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:45,030
Right in this game, yes. It's always going to be losing left.

145
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:50,850
Right. The expected value of any ticket is net of any $1 ticket is -$0.50.

146
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:54,060
So if I buy 100 of them, I'm going to lose on average $50.

147
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:59,400
Any ticket has an expected value of a 50 cent loss.

148
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:06,750
You only get on average half half the money you get back. That's exactly right.

149
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:16,129
So that's the pure risk situation. Things like the COVID 19 pandemic are really much more the closer to a pure uncertainty we had.

150
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:19,830
Yeah, sure. We had some vague idea that it's possible pandemic could happen.

151
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:27,600
We had some vague idea that maybe it could be really bad, but we really didn't have the ability to put the numbers on that and say,

152
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:34,410
what's the probability in the next year that something happens that's as bad as the COVID 19 pandemic turned out to be?

153
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:42,920
We have been very hard pressed to write down an equation for that with sort of any level of confidence that we're not making an epidemiologist laugh.

154
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:53,400
Okay. So former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld kind of, I think, really encapsulated the difference since there are known unknowns.

155
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:59,220
That is to say there are things that we know we don't know. But there are also unknown unknowns.

156
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:03,930
There are things we know we don't know. The first is kind of more like risk.

157
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:07,350
I don't know what number is going to come up tonight when they draw the winning numbers.

158
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:16,849
I know. I don't know that, but I know. The scenario well enough to make an intelligent decision.

159
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:27,320
Is it worth my while to play this game tonight? There are things like the COVID 19 pandemic that hit us out of the blue,

160
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:31,999
and we don't have enough of a historical track record because these are such rare events.

161
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,980
And when they occur, they occur in such different scenarios and such different levels of severity.

162
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,550
We can't really put good numbers on it.

163
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:46,040
A lot of decisions are somewhere between risk and uncertainty. So that retirement decision we talked about,

164
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:51,950
you can go to sort of any mutual fund companies website and you can and they'll

165
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:55,970
have some type of a calculator that will do sort of a statistical simulation of,

166
00:17:56,510 --> 00:18:01,010
you know, if you save a certain amount of money per year for however many years you're going to be

167
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:04,580
working and you want to have a certain amount of money for a year when you're retired.

168
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:08,420
So what's the probability you'll meet your target?

169
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:16,910
What's the probability that you'll have your target amount of money for retirement if you save a certain amount?

170
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:20,900
And what they do is they feed in historical data from the stock market and

171
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:26,209
randomly draw from that distribution and try to simulate well what might happen.

172
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:34,340
So they do that, say a thousand times the simulation, a thousand times drawing numbers from that distribution of historical returns.

173
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:39,770
And they say, well, you know, you're saving enough that you've got an 80% chance that you're going to make your target.

174
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:45,530
So that's kind of describing as a situation of risk. They kind of know the distributions.

175
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:53,180
They can they can write down this formula. It's more complicated, obviously, because it's their stock market returns over a 30 year period,

176
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:57,560
but they can still sort of write down the analog of this formula and calculate it.

177
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:02,720
But there's still a little bit of uncertainty because that makes an assumption that that

178
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:08,510
historical data continues to be predictive of the distribution of returns in the future.

179
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:14,510
So if the game fundamentally changes in ways we don't know, there's also uncertainty.

180
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:17,780
So we can kind of take the risk element out and say,

181
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:25,669
assuming that these historical stock market returns are predictive of the sort of the distribution of returns in the future,

182
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:30,680
there's an 80% chance of the plan you've written down will meet your retirement income target.

183
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:36,650
So that's treating it as pure risk. The first thing it's going to say on that model is past performance.

184
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:41,780
It's not an indication of future. Exactly, because that's sort of acknowledging there's also uncertainty.

185
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,670
So a lot of decisions we have to make are sort of between risk and uncertainty.

186
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:52,280
There's enough we can calculate to sort of say there's a risk element to it that's kind of predictable.

187
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:59,330
I don't know what the outcome is going to be, but I can kind of understand what the probabilities are, what the possible range of outcomes is.

188
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:06,440
But the world might actually change in ways that I really can't put into that model.

189
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:11,450
So that's exactly as Andrew said, the past performance is not a guarantee of future results.

190
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:18,440
The disclaimer they put in all of their stuff. So it's mostly a risk situation because it's worked pretty well till now.

191
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:26,269
It seems like if you were doing this exercise 20 years ago, the world didn't change that fundamentally over the last 20 years.

192
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:29,900
But that doesn't mean it's not going to change that fundamentally over the next 20 years.

193
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:38,590
So we're going to mainly be dealing with situations of risk because those are the ones that we can kind of manage.

194
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:48,130
So are you risk averse? And suppose I pull out a coin, as they call it, in the air.

195
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:52,569
If you call it right, I say you $5,000.

196
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:59,170
If you call it wrong, you pay me $5,000. Is there anybody here this morning that would take me up on that?

197
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:05,140
And you would one. One person is not risk averse.

198
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:11,590
The rest of you, you'll like that bet or not. What makes you queasy about that bet?

199
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:20,709
It's a lot better than the lottery bets and expected value terms of the lottery, but on average, you're losing $0.50 for every dollar.

200
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:25,000
You bet. $5,000 loss can really stymie somebody's future education.

201
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:30,070
Okay. So we've got the expected value of that bet.

202
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:39,340
There's a 50% chance you lose 5000, 50% chance you win 5000.

203
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:46,270
So the expected value is zero. So on average, you break even playing that bus.

204
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:50,890
So that's what we call an actuarially fair gamble. On average, you break even.

205
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:54,280
This is an actuarially unfair gamble. On average, you lose money.

206
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:00,549
But you're you know, that's a much better bet. On average, you break even.

207
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:04,720
So Andrew said, Well, wait a sec.

208
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,620
You'd think, what would happen to my life if I lost $5,000?

209
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,770
What would happen to my life if I won $5,000?

210
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:18,520
If you kind of think of those things sort of equally, you sort of be indifferent to taking this bet or not.

211
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:24,770
Like you probably think about, well, wait a second, if I gained $5,000, hey, that would be awesome.

212
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:29,650
These are the things I could do. What if I lost $5,000?

213
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:33,400
That would probably suck. More than winning would be great.

214
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:43,240
Plus, if what I did was go check your horoscope and try to remove the uncertainty.

215
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:50,380
So the fact that only one person took up this bet said that most of you guys are risk averse.

216
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:57,490
Yeah. Should everyone be more willing to take this bet? The increase as you increase the amount of coin flips that you're doing it off.

217
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:04,570
So if you said we're going to flip 100 coins, if on average it's more what you call it than it is what I call, can I give you the money?

218
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:09,490
Should I be more willing to take that that it seems like I should then just offer one coin flip.

219
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,760
Yeah. See, you'd have to then calculate sort of the probability that.

220
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:20,140
So it's still, if it's just whoever wins the most flips that are still be a 5050 chance to win or lose $5,000 ultimately, right?

221
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:26,290
Ideally, yeah. Yeah. They can still leave you in the same situation.

222
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:37,600
So. So basically the idea is that the extra utility I would get from having 5000 more than I currently have is a smaller

223
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:45,160
increment in all likelihood than the negative increment utility I'd have from having to give up $5,000 that I currently have.

224
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:50,169
So even though the best in financial terms is a fair amount, on average, it's a break even.

225
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:56,600
But it's not tilted my favor. It's not tilted in your favor. The state lottery is tilted in the state's favor.

226
00:23:57,830 --> 00:24:01,580
On average, the state wins money. On average, the players lose money.

227
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:11,780
This bet is not tilted in either side's favor. But if you look at it in utility terms, I really, really, really don't like that scenario.

228
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:16,500
As much as I like this. This sounds worse to me.

229
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:21,810
This. The pain of this sounds worse than the gain of this.

230
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:30,280
So even if you lose 1000 and you gained 5000, it would still be it would be a profitable bet, I guess.

231
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:41,120
But most people would not even. Can I make this bet enough in your favor that you would take it $10 if I had?

232
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:53,620
So how about this? Yeah.

233
00:24:54,240 --> 00:25:05,550
Yeah. So there's still risk, but now it's it's tilted so far in your favor that you're tempted to take that risk.

234
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:15,390
So appetite are still going to have a bad outcome. But that bad outcome is not nearly as bad as the good outcome is good.

235
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:22,889
So even though you're risk averse, you wouldn't take the break even that I can make it sufficiently in your favor,

236
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:28,710
either by changing the outcomes or by changing the probabilities so you can keep it a $5,000 bet.

237
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:39,740
But what if I made it? 99.9% of the time you win and one in a thousand times you lose.

238
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:44,840
Who's going to take that? But I'm sorry. I put the probably was the wrong one.

239
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:51,590
20.01 and that's what you point 9099.

240
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:57,770
You take that but one in a thousand chance of losing a thousand wouldn't take that.

241
00:25:57,770 --> 00:26:01,730
But 1000 chance of the weight of losing 5000.

242
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,640
But 99.9% chance of winning 5000. Yeah.

243
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:10,490
You know, so I can make the bet sufficiently in your favor. That doesn't mean you're not risk averse.

244
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:15,200
It just means that now it's a sufficiently favorable bet. It's worth taking the risk.

245
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:26,120
Risk aversion just means you're going to tend to turn down the break. Even bet you'd rather just keep the money you have now and take a break.

246
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:37,720
Even bet of winning or losing $5,000. Scott We ask a different question, and this is kind of in lines it's kind of changing the odds in your favor.

247
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:43,990
If you're a game show contestant. You're the winner at the end. You've got $45,000 on the board.

248
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:50,390
The host offers you the opportunity to play the coin toss for 100,000.

249
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:57,550
You put up your 45. If it comes out your way, you're going to get 100,000.

250
00:26:57,970 --> 00:27:01,750
If it doesn't, you've lost your 45,000 that you won in the game show.

251
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:06,310
Anybody want to take that bet? You're going to keep your 45.

252
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:12,489
You know what? I'm I'm happy with my 45, but that's actually a winning bet on average for you.

253
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:19,600
On average, you would make money taking that bet. But if you're risk averse enough, you'd say, you know, I'd rather have 45,000 for sure.

254
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:27,300
Then 100,000 half the time and nothing the other half of the time.

255
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:31,950
Right. But this is actually a better than actuarially fair bet. But it's not better enough.

256
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:36,520
So this one was better enough, I tell you, as a 99.9% chance you're in a win.

257
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:45,499
5000. Okay. Yeah, I'm in. So that's a better bet than than on average,

258
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:49,520
it's a winning bet to play in financial terms where utility terms that might

259
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:53,900
still not be a favorable bet rather is have the 45 and what have the gore.

260
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:01,879
So here are the two statistical concepts that we've already kind of used.

261
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:13,310
So we use that here in the equation for the three lottery game probability and then we calculate an expected value.

262
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:21,950
We have the probability of the losing outcome times the outcome, probability of the winning outcome, times what that outcome is.

263
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:29,360
And then that gets us the expected value that $1 to get has an expected value of a 50 cent loss.

264
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:35,030
On average, every dollar I play only returns me $0.50.

265
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:40,430
So I've lost $0.50 on average for every dollar that I put on the pick three lottery game.

266
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:45,470
So use the probabilities, the relative frequency as they obviously have to sum to one.

267
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:53,090
In 1989 was .01 and I can calculate the expected outcome.

268
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:58,970
So this bet that claims toss bad was what we call an actuarially fair gamble.

269
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:04,010
It has an expected value of zero, so naturally it's not tilted in favor of either side.

270
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:11,690
This is a worse than actuarially fair bet on average is tilted on the other party side, you're the player.

271
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:15,860
The state on average wins money, the player on average ages money.

272
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:26,299
That game show bet 50% chance of winning 100,000, whereas you lose 45,000 if you come out.

273
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:30,050
That's actually a better than fair bet. On average, the player wins money.

274
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:41,990
Are there better than fair bets available in the real world? She's already talked about one.

275
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:50,030
Yeah. It's like saving for retirement. Is it a fair bet?

276
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:55,730
So the stock market. So on average, you make money in the stock market, on average,

277
00:29:55,730 --> 00:30:00,610
you make more money in the stock market than you would just keeping your money in something much safer.

278
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:05,900
You can keep your money in a bank certificate of deposit and earn 1%.

279
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:13,640
You know, maybe now 2% stock market on average, you're going to make 7 to 10% in a year.

280
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:17,629
It's a riskier 7 to 10% because it might go up 35% this year.

281
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:22,400
It might go down 35% this year. But in the average year, it goes up 7 to 10%.

282
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:28,700
So it's a better than fair bet if you compare it to safer alternatives, keeping your money in your mattress,

283
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:32,450
keeping it in your checking account, putting it in the bank, certificate of deposit.

284
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:35,960
I say a very safe U.S. government bond.

285
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:42,170
Investments are much safer. They all have much lower returns and the average return on the stock market.

286
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:46,780
So stocks give you a riskier and in fact, it has to be that way.

287
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:52,880
Would you put your money in the stock market at greater risk if there wasn't the expectation of a greater return?

288
00:30:54,470 --> 00:31:00,500
I told you the stock market on average returned 1% a year and a bank certificate of deposit is 1% a year.

289
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:06,590
Why would you put your money in the stock market, taking on greater volatility for no reward?

290
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:17,150
So financial assets that are riskier tend to on average have higher returns in order to tempt people to invest in them.

291
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:19,340
Yes. What about buying, like real estate?

292
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:31,530
So real estate would be another good example because on average the return probably is higher than it is in a very a very safe asset,

293
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:35,910
a government bond or something like that. But it's going to be more unpredictable.

294
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:41,860
From year to year. So we've had a huge run up in real estate values over the last few years, obviously,

295
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:48,700
and now mortgage interest rates are going way up and that's going to put sort of a cap on real estate prices for a while.

296
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:58,950
So mortgage interest was two and a half percent. You know, people could afford a mortgage on a very large properties.

297
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:04,870
Therefore, they could make a very large offer on it. Mortgage interest rates are heading towards 6%.

298
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:12,069
The monthly payment is a lot higher. So people are not going to offer $1,000,000 on a property that they would have offered

299
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:15,760
$1,000,000 on if they could have gotten a mortgage or two and a half percent.

300
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:21,130
So we had a big run up in real estate prices, and now that's sort of slowing.

301
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:29,800
So as much as it gets more, it's probably less volatile in the stock market, but it's more volatile than a bank account.

302
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:34,090
For a government bond, it's the real estate broker somewhere in between.

303
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:43,100
Okay. So expected value, we've already kind of done this calculation.

304
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:46,340
We sort of sum over all the possible outcomes.

305
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:55,219
Here are the probabilities, there are the outcomes. So an hour to an hour to outcome world, that formula just is well,

306
00:32:55,220 --> 00:33:00,170
probability of loss times is the outcome, probability of a win times, the winning outcome.

307
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:08,750
And if we had more outcomes, if we had, say, a DI or one through six and you get the amount of dollars that that that's come up,

308
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:19,820
you could calculate that out to be 162 times $1 +16 times $2, so on until one six plus $6 and $73.50 with the average outcome.

309
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:27,770
If I let you roll a die one time and I gave you a dollar for every dot so you can calculate the expected value.

310
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:38,630
So Nicholas said is book. It's a nice definition of risk aversion, the tendency of people to refuse to accept fair gambles.

311
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:47,210
So the fact that you guys turned down my $5,000 coin toss, which was a fair gamble, sort of implies that you're a risk averse.

312
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:54,500
There is you rather is keep what you have now and take that even money chance of gaining or losing $5,000.

313
00:33:56,930 --> 00:34:03,559
And we're going to see that the attitudes towards risk or be very much related to the shape of the utility of income curve,

314
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:09,680
which we're going to define in a moment. And that tells us sort of about how you feel about gaining versus losing income.

315
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:15,890
Diminishing marginal utility of income where you talk about the ice cream cone effect.

316
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:22,220
Hot summer day. How much happier are you with one scoop cone than having no ice cream at all?

317
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:26,360
How much additional happiness do you get from upgrading to a second scoop?

318
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,850
How much additional happiness do you get from upgrade?

319
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:35,450
Upgrading from two scoops to three for most goods would have the sort of diminishing marginal utility property.

320
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:39,980
The more I already have, the less additional happiness I get from another unit.

321
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:44,340
That fourth slice of pizza doesn't give me as much extra happiness as the third,

322
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:49,910
which doesn't give me as much as a second do, which doesn't give me as much extra happiness as the first.

323
00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:56,810
So if that's true, for most of the stuff we buy, what do we use to buy stuff?

324
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:10,280
Our money, right? So if the stuff we buy with our money generates diminishing utility, our money probably generates diminishing utility.

325
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:20,990
If you find a $20 bill, go take a nice walk in the ARB at lunch and there's a $20 bill and there's nobody around.

326
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:26,750
So there's nobody. You can be an honest person and say that you lose this $20 bill.

327
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:32,890
You can pick it up a week from now.

328
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:37,980
If I ask you, Hey, what did you do with that $20? Ah, you have an answer for me?

329
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:51,200
Probably. You brought me on. Tell me what you did with that $20. Bill Gates is walking through the E.R., sees that $20 bill is going to pick it up.

330
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:58,459
So maybe probably he's going to depend. What's the likelihood I'm going to pull my back by leaning over?

331
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:00,650
Is that worth $20? To me, maybe it is.

332
00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:06,410
But if I ask him a week later, what did you do in your life with that $20 that you wouldn't have done had you not found it?

333
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:11,650
But Bill Gates have an answer for you. Not a clue.

334
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:16,690
Yeah. So the more income you have, the more stuff you have.

335
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:21,250
So presumably the less additional happiness you're going to get from another $20.

336
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:32,430
So that implies that if we kind of graph utility against income for most people would expect it to have a convex shape.

337
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:36,159
It's rising with income. So the pay principle is not being violated.

338
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:45,580
More does make you happier. More income, more utility, but it rises at a declining rate of diminishing marginal utility of income.

339
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:51,739
So we've got one, one low level of income here, a graph, sort of a tangent line.

340
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:58,910
It's very steep. In other words, if my income as low by utility rises very rapidly as I get more income.

341
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:06,470
Now, if I have much more income, if I'm starting out like to when I graph that tangent line, it's much flatter.

342
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:12,590
My utility is still rising with the income. That tangent line is a positive slope, but it's a much smaller slope.

343
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:23,990
Now think back to that coin toss, but that kind of says that, well, if I lose that $5,000, I'm losing increasingly painful dollars to lose.

344
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:31,430
If I win that $5,000, I'm winning decreasingly joyful dollars to win.

345
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:38,310
It's going to really hurt me to move down here. It's not going to help me as much to move up here.

346
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:44,580
And that's kind of why that financially fair bet doesn't sound very good.

347
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:53,730
Do you think the things I'm gaining with the extra $5,000 are not worth as much to me as the things I'm sacrificing?

348
00:37:53,730 --> 00:38:00,820
If I lose, the $5,000 would hurt me. So let's guys see this graphically.

349
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:14,110
Suppose we have a consumer that has an initial income, $10,000, and they face this $5,000 coin toss.

350
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:21,660
But and I've kind of made up some numbers here that are just consistent with the convex shape of the utility of income curve.

351
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:26,710
In other words, steeper to flatter and steeper to flatter.

352
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:32,680
So if they lose, well, they only have $5,000 left.

353
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:38,940
And so their utility would be 20. If they win, they have 15,000 utility bills.

354
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:48,960
36. Now let's jump ahead to the graph and kind of see how they would think about this decision.

355
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:56,670
So, first of all, if they don't take the bet, if they just walk away like you guys all walked away,

356
00:38:56,670 --> 00:39:00,180
with one exception for a $5,000 bet, what would they have?

357
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:06,750
Does keep their original $10,000 and they'd have no uncertainty.

358
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:10,080
They would know for sure that they were going to be right here.

359
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:14,610
They're going to have an income of $10,000 for sure in their utility.

360
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:22,020
Reading off that graph is going to be 30. So that's the default outcome of I don't take the bet and I just walk away.

361
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:30,100
What would happen if I took the bet? Well, if I took the bet half the time, I'd lose.

362
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:34,040
I'd be at point B. I income would be 5000.

363
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:37,440
My utility would be 20 at the time I'd win.

364
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:41,700
That would be awesome. Likely 15,000. My utility would be 36.

365
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:48,510
What's my average utility if I take the bet, which is only 28?

366
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:55,979
I average my average income is 10,000, 5000 times 0.5 plus 15,000 times.

367
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:59,340
0.5 is 10,000. So that's my average income.

368
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:05,220
So I average income is exactly the same if I take the bet or not because it's a fair bet.

369
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:10,500
On average, it's a break even. But. It's a coin spinning in the air.

370
00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:18,370
My income, I know, is either going to be 15 or five, but as it's spinning, the expected value of my income is 10,000.

371
00:40:18,370 --> 00:40:24,850
That hasn't changed because it's a break even bet, but the expected value of my utility has plummeted.

372
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:30,300
It's only 28. Half the time I utility will be 20.

373
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:34,450
Half the time will be 36. On average, it's 28.

374
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:35,530
That's sort of point six.

375
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:46,440
We kind of drew a cord kind of connecting the good and the bad outcomes, connecting point A and point C by day point B and then since it's a 5050 bet,

376
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:51,540
we identified sort of the midpoint of that cord as sort of the expected value of my outcome.

377
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:56,309
On average, I get $10,000 of income. This is a break even.

378
00:40:56,310 --> 00:40:59,640
But on average, on average, I get a utility, a 28.

379
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:07,860
So on average, I'm not losing money if I accept the gamble, but I am losing utility on average.

380
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:14,760
That's why I'm going to turn it down. It's not a dollar losing bet, but it's a utility losing that.

381
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:20,870
And why is that? It's because with the shape, this concave shape,

382
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:32,360
it says the pain of losing $5,000 is a loss of ten units of utility and that exceeds the gain six units of utility from winning 5000.

383
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:41,870
So I it's made up hypothetical numbers, but their numbers that are consistent with a concave dimension, Mars utility, IT income curve.

384
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,060
I could have made up any other numbers,

385
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:52,850
but we have done different numbers and have gotten the same result that the person would turn down a fair bet because it's fair in financial terms,

386
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:55,810
it's unfair in utility terms, on average.

387
00:41:55,820 --> 00:42:04,940
Are you losing utility because the pain of losing $5,000 is greater than the joy of winning 5000 because you're

388
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:13,040
losing increasingly important dollars because how this slope is changing is the logic of that kind of makes sense?

389
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:18,110
That makes sense sort of in your life in terms of why you all turn down that bet.

390
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:25,340
You say, well, wait a second, yeah, I get extra happiness from the stuff I could get with the $5,000 if I won.

391
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:35,390
But that extra happiness is probably less than the pain I'd suffer from giving up the $5,000 of stuff if I lost.

392
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:48,180
So as your utility of income as this concave shape. More money is worth something to you, but it's more you have less additional dollars are worth.

393
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:58,680
So you're turning down that that sort of implies that, you know, I don't know the exact numbers apply to you,

394
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:05,010
but this basic shape of the time page utility of income curve applies to you.

395
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:11,620
Some of you might be more risk averse than others. But not a question related to the utility, I'm sure.

396
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:17,710
I just get confused by the terminology because I feel like you use concave and comebacks interchangeably.

397
00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:24,110
And to me that looks comebacks. No, I just said convex by mistake at first.

398
00:43:24,410 --> 00:43:27,590
Convex would be that. Okay.

399
00:43:27,590 --> 00:43:33,760
So it's whatever is towards the bottom. Yeah. So convex think of it as it's it's increasingly steep.

400
00:43:33,770 --> 00:43:37,190
If we keep drawing tangent lines, it's getting deeper and deeper.

401
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:42,200
Where it's concave, it's getting flatter.

402
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:46,430
Flatter. Thank you. So, for example,

403
00:43:48,530 --> 00:44:02,090
I agree something like the positive segment of Y equals X squared and this might be the positive segment of Y equals the square root of X.

404
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:11,630
And if we had a line that would be neither concave nor convex, so that would be.

405
00:44:14,310 --> 00:44:19,650
So you can think of this stuff, express themselves X to the one half.

406
00:44:21,810 --> 00:44:24,840
So if you had the symbol function, y equals X to some power.

407
00:44:25,590 --> 00:44:29,549
If the power is exactly equal to one, it's neither concave nor convex.

408
00:44:29,550 --> 00:44:34,290
It's linear. If the power is greater than one, it would be convex.

409
00:44:34,290 --> 00:44:36,780
If that power is less than one, it would be concave.

410
00:44:38,370 --> 00:44:46,739
So if we had, say, X to the 0.9, that's still going to be concave, but it's going to be much closer to linear.

411
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:54,920
It's going to have less curvature. And this person would not be quite as risk averse as this person would be.

412
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:02,530
It's a bit closer to their their utility of income would still decline.

413
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:06,670
Partial utility can still decline with that kind of decline much more gradually.

414
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:13,290
So certainly we could be very different. Our risk aversion if we go back to.

415
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:42,250
So let's do the coin toss. So there is a break even.

416
00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:46,070
But. Let's make it a little bit better.

417
00:45:46,190 --> 00:45:49,310
Let's make it 6040. You win.

418
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:54,800
How many takers do I have at 6040? Who's feeling lucky today?

419
00:45:55,540 --> 00:46:00,069
Got one in the back. What if I needed 70?

420
00:46:00,070 --> 00:46:03,400
30? How many takers do I have?

421
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:09,129
A bunch of your friends. So you're the least risk averse in the group?

422
00:46:09,130 --> 00:46:17,110
You're still risk averse because you turn down the break even. But one person said, You know what, that's 6040.

423
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:21,490
I meant, I'll take my chances. That's enough of a gain on average.

424
00:46:22,510 --> 00:46:29,140
Then we had about three more people. So at 7030, we're in who's at 8020?

425
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:35,840
Okay. About half the class now is raise their hand by this point.

426
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:45,800
Who's in at 9010. I said, let's see who's not in at 9010 and still want to lose $5,000.

427
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:52,200
I'm still out. Okay, so we got one person that everybody else is in at 9010.

428
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:57,150
So we've got variation in risk aversion. You're the most risk averse person in the class.

429
00:47:00,550 --> 00:47:12,310
I'm the oldest. That's why. You have to least time to make up for the loss of.

430
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:18,770
So certainly there'd be a lot of variations be drawn, this particular person down.

431
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:24,860
If we had sort of a less concave curve when it still was concave and still one steeper to flatter,

432
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:27,760
but it was more gradual, is closer to a straight line.

433
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:34,310
Or if somebody was even more risk averse, that was really sort of how much they were to test that bet.

434
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:36,650
But they would all turn down the break, even that.

435
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:43,690
They're the ones that the tests at least would have to have the bet stacked less in their favor to change their minds.

436
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:54,270
So I've talked that through already. So we can also.

437
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:58,049
Use that graph to answer sort of a different,

438
00:47:58,050 --> 00:48:04,680
but it turns out for motivating the existence of insurance markets and understanding why they exist and the basis on which they can work.

439
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:15,570
A very important question what income with that consumer that we graphed have to have with certainty to be just as well off as taking the gamble?

440
00:48:15,870 --> 00:48:18,929
Sort of frame the question a little differently. First, we framed it as well.

441
00:48:18,930 --> 00:48:24,930
They could walk away and keep the $10,000 because it's their choice to take the gamble or not.

442
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:40,010
Suppose we think of a little bit differently. What if they kind of had to take the gamble?

443
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:44,469
And then we asked them instead of, you know, do you want to take it or not?

444
00:48:44,470 --> 00:48:45,680
Because you can walk away.

445
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:56,240
And I well, you've got to take this gamble, but I'll give you the opportunity to buy out of it, to pay me some money to avoid taking the gamble.

446
00:48:56,780 --> 00:49:00,290
What's the most this person could would be willing to pay you?

447
00:49:00,830 --> 00:49:05,060
I would argue they'd be willing to pay you up to $2,000 to avoid taking the gamble.

448
00:49:07,630 --> 00:49:12,310
If they took the gamble. So the default is they have to take it. They don't have the choice of walking away.

449
00:49:12,910 --> 00:49:16,600
Said, Well, if I have to take it on average, my utility is going to be 28.

450
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:24,230
If I could walk away. Well, yeah, then I'd have my 10,000 for sure, and my utility be 30.

451
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:32,000
But if I don't have that option of walking away. And somebody else comes along and says, You know what?

452
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:35,820
I'll take that risk for you. I'll bear that risk.

453
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:41,170
Some kind of like an insurance company now. But you're going to have to pay me something for that.

454
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:49,910
All I would argue is that this person would be willing to pay up to $2,000 to avoid taking that gamble.

455
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:57,260
Why? Because here's their expected utility of 28. If they if they take the gamble, you can ask for what money?

456
00:49:57,260 --> 00:50:03,890
What amount of money? If they had it for sure. It would leave them with the utility of 28.

457
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:09,470
So can I just go horizontally over here 28 until we hit the utility of income curve,

458
00:50:10,370 --> 00:50:14,930
drop down to the income axis and we agreed off an amount of money, about $80,000.

459
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:20,240
So they'd be willing to give up up to $2,000 of their original ten.

460
00:50:23,030 --> 00:50:32,400
To pay me to bear that risk for them. If I only charge them $1,000.

461
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:35,190
Well, then they say, Well, I have 9000 for sure,

462
00:50:36,390 --> 00:50:46,440
and I'd be up here and I definitely be happier at 9000 for sure than being stuck taking my chances and only having utility of 28 on average.

463
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,950
So we're kind of asking what's the utility level of that?

464
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:56,970
What's the income that, if they had it for sure, would give them a utility that's the same as their expected or average utility taking about.

465
00:50:58,110 --> 00:51:02,729
So the fact that risk averse people are willing to pay some money for sure to avoid risk,

466
00:51:02,730 --> 00:51:07,800
to have somebody else bear that risk for them is the basis for the existence of insurance markets.

467
00:51:11,230 --> 00:51:15,360
And we'll kind of transform this into a more explicit insurance question in a few moments.

468
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:22,770
The fact that I'm risk averse as I'm willing to pay you something to bear that risk

469
00:51:22,770 --> 00:51:28,080
on my behalf provides some the business model for insurance markets to exist.

470
00:51:28,170 --> 00:51:40,200
I have to know how to do. We assume it's 2000. So we're kind of we know that $10,000 is the initial level of income that the person has.

471
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:46,860
And then we're saying, well, what amount of money we give them a utility of 28 for sure.

472
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:51,600
If they had 8000 for sure. So we're kind of reading that off. The graph is saying.

473
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:57,750
Let's come over here to utility of 28 and so we hit this utility income curve drop down

474
00:51:57,750 --> 00:52:03,270
to here read off that amount of money and that's $2,000 less than the original 10,000.

475
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:16,230
So this person basically would get a utility of 28 either if they had a $8,000 risk free or they faced this gamble starting with 10,000.

476
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:22,230
But they could go up to 15 or could drop to five equal probability thinking.

477
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:33,209
So just going back, yes, you made an example of they pay 1000, but they would be on the hook, but they wouldn't they would still be a utility of 28.

478
00:52:33,210 --> 00:52:40,300
Right. If they paid 1000, then that would lock in nine and they'd be up here.

479
00:52:41,890 --> 00:52:48,670
So utility would be somewhere around 29. Somewhere in that triangle.

480
00:52:49,070 --> 00:52:54,860
Basically 2000 is the most they pay. They'd be indifferent to paying $2,000 to have me bear this risk.

481
00:52:55,880 --> 00:53:01,370
So if I came, if I was the insurance company and said, You've got to pay me $3,000 for me to bear this risk,

482
00:53:01,790 --> 00:53:05,119
they're going to say, you know what, I'm risk averse. I want you to bear this risk for me.

483
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:12,500
But no, because I only have $7,000 left, I'm better off just taking my chances because that's too high of a premium.

484
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:19,530
If there's 1000, they say, Yeah, I'm definitely in. I'd much rather lose $1,000 for sure.

485
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:29,580
They have a 50% chance of losing 5000, and then if they pay $2,000, so to speak, I want I could buy it or I could take my chances and.

486
00:53:30,770 --> 00:53:36,050
Yes, the maximum. That's the maximum they'd be willing to pay to have somebody else bear that risk for them.

487
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:39,920
So all we did was we flipped the default, the original default as well.

488
00:53:40,430 --> 00:53:44,209
I can walk away from the risk. I can avoid it just by saying, you know, that bet.

489
00:53:44,210 --> 00:53:47,210
On average, Lewis loses utility. I don't want to take it.

490
00:53:47,750 --> 00:53:53,329
So now would just change the default. This is a risk you face in your life and you can't walk away from it.

491
00:53:53,330 --> 00:53:55,670
You can't just simply say, I don't want to face that risk.

492
00:53:56,330 --> 00:54:03,140
But an insurance company might come along and say, I will bear that risk for you in exchange for some money.

493
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:12,920
So they'd be willing to pay $2,000 to the insurance company over that risk up to 2000.

494
00:54:16,010 --> 00:54:19,730
The larger the gamble, the lower the expected utility.

495
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:24,780
So you're we've got to 5050 coin tosses. But the stakes are different.

496
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:28,879
We had the original $5,000 one and now we're going to drop.

497
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:36,260
It'll only be a $2,000 bet. Now we draw a can that cord connecting the winning and losing outcomes in those two scenarios.

498
00:54:37,910 --> 00:54:40,940
And we see that with the bigger bet that cord is lower.

499
00:54:42,110 --> 00:55:01,060
So on average if I were to lose. There's the average outcome of a $5,000 bet.

500
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:07,840
Take that over to the utility axis. Now, if I had the same bet, 5050 chance of winning or losing.

501
00:55:08,830 --> 00:55:12,250
But it's only for $2,000 stakes rather than 5000.

502
00:55:18,330 --> 00:55:24,840
And that isn't quite as bad. It's still worse than just keeping my 10,000, which would guarantee my utility of 30.

503
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:32,470
So if I told this person, you have to take one of these two bets, you don't have the option of just walking away.

504
00:55:33,370 --> 00:55:36,159
So if I asked you, can we're gonna play this coin toss game,

505
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:40,600
I have some way of forcing you to play it so you don't have the option of saying No thanks,

506
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:45,190
but I'm willing to let you play it for either $5,000 or $2,000.

507
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:49,239
Which one of those bets are you going to take? You'd have to take one of them.

508
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:57,280
You can't walk away and take the $2,000 bet because the $5,000 bet puts really, really bad outcomes in play.

509
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:02,670
Losing a lot. That's getting evicted from your apartment, losing $2,000.

510
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:04,720
It's. Well, I get my car repossessed.

511
00:56:06,750 --> 00:56:12,180
I'd probably rather get my car repossessed and get my car repossessed and lose my home and get evicted from my apartment.

512
00:56:14,970 --> 00:56:20,760
So if you have to take one of those two bets, the expected utility of the smaller bet is going to be higher.

513
00:56:21,390 --> 00:56:24,870
And the same odds of winning or losing. It's still a coin toss of 5050.

514
00:56:27,790 --> 00:56:31,219
But the bigger bad is much worse than the smaller bet is.

515
00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:38,920
The bigger bet puts you're losing much more important dollars if you have to go all the way down to 5000 rather than having to go up to 8000.

516
00:56:45,630 --> 00:56:51,510
You think of the utility of income curve as representing how much utility you might get if I get a certain amount of money for sure.

517
00:56:57,990 --> 00:57:01,080
You know, once I lose the bet, if I take the 5000. But yeah.

518
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:08,310
Then I'll have you told me you have to 20 for sure. Once I win the bet then I'll have a utility of 15,000 or 36 for sure.

519
00:57:10,210 --> 00:57:14,380
As the coin is spinning. Have I accepted that bigger bet? I would only be here on average.

520
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:19,810
I wouldn't know yet where I was going to be, but once I once I win or lose, I'm going to be on the curve.

521
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:26,500
That tells you 20 is the age is my utility. If I have 5000 for sure, I've already lost the bet.

522
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:33,490
Being on the curves of sort of how much utility do I get if I know I have that amount of money?

523
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:41,660
The more concave it is like we talked about with these mathematical equations.

524
00:57:41,660 --> 00:57:45,130
If we had X to the point nine that would be closer to a line.

525
00:57:45,890 --> 00:57:53,330
We less concave, that person would be less risk averse than somebody whose utility of income was the square root of income.

526
00:58:00,330 --> 00:58:07,830
Convex going back to Andrew's question. So what if what if we had a person who actually had convex utility of income?

527
00:58:09,510 --> 00:58:15,630
That person actually is a risk seeking person. So we didn't find any of them in our classroom today.

528
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:25,889
But for whatever reason, I had increasing marginal utility of income that those first dollars are worth relatively little to me.

529
00:58:25,890 --> 00:58:29,910
And the richer I am, the more I value getting at getting yet another dollar.

530
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:34,830
Then I would actually love to have that actuarially fair gamble.

531
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:39,660
Financially break even. Gamble would on average win utility for me.

532
00:58:40,770 --> 00:58:47,190
So let's give this person the $5,000 coin toss and say, well, I get this utility.

533
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:51,450
If I lose starting from ten, I got this utility if I win.

534
00:58:52,530 --> 00:58:55,650
What's my average utility as the coin spinning in the air?

535
00:58:57,570 --> 00:59:00,750
It'll be the midpoint of that cord connecting the winning and losing outcomes.

536
00:59:00,750 --> 00:59:08,730
Again, midpoint. This is a 5050 chance and that's greater than my utility of just keeping my $10,000.

537
00:59:11,070 --> 00:59:15,600
So risk seeking versus let's say you're offering me a 5050 coin toss for 5000.

538
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:21,630
I'm all in. I love that deal. Nobody like that in this room, right?

539
00:59:26,270 --> 00:59:30,310
And then the third scenario, somebody who has a linear utility of income curves,

540
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:34,790
constant marginal utility of income at first dollar adds a certain amount of utility.

541
00:59:34,790 --> 00:59:39,690
The second dollar adds the exact same amount of utilities, $1,000 adds the exact same amount,

542
00:59:39,730 --> 00:59:44,120
extra utility, the million dollar adds the exact same amount of extra utility.

543
00:59:44,810 --> 00:59:52,639
She wouldn't see that this person would be kind of indifferent between that 5050 coin toss as well.

544
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:57,270
If they lost, they'd be down here. If they won, they'd be up here.

545
00:59:58,040 --> 01:00:03,410
If we draw a cord connecting the winning and losing outcomes, well, that cord is just going to be coincident with that line.

546
01:00:03,740 --> 01:00:11,200
Can't even see it. And say, well, if they kept their money for sure to be their utility.

547
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:18,720
If they took their gamble, well, the average utility would be the midpoint of that sport connecting,

548
01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:24,180
losing and winning outcomes, which is going to be exactly the same place.

549
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:32,580
So that person is going to say, well, my expected utility from accepting this bet is exactly equal to my utility from walking away.

550
01:00:33,660 --> 01:00:36,930
So who cares? So we call this person risk neutral.

551
01:00:39,330 --> 01:00:46,770
The vast majority of people are going to be risk averse or have a continuity of income function, some more concave than others.

552
01:00:46,770 --> 01:00:53,910
So we had Andrew didn't even take the 90% bet on a 5001 person.

553
01:00:54,270 --> 01:00:59,330
I take the 60% bet. So those are the extremes of risk aversion with respect to that.

554
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:08,700
But in this classroom, most people were either in it's sort of I think my 70% we had most people in the majority of more in my 70% of making a

555
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:22,900
$0.70 throw in their favor and into the if you want to add to my bet Neal subsidizes but you have an investor Andrew.

556
01:01:24,540 --> 01:01:35,750
I'm all about spent and other people are saying okay okay so with that original bet we talked about the tax free lottery ticket.

557
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:41,639
You can avoid risk altogether because nobody is going to make you play in a lot of scenarios.

558
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:49,500
So we can't just walk away from risk. So we have to figure out how can we produce that are manages and two basic ways we could

559
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:56,790
buy insurance against risks where we could diversify the retirement stock portfolio.

560
01:01:58,470 --> 01:02:03,270
Got a tip from your brother in law that this is an awesome stock.

561
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:11,460
This is where you ought to put your money. You immediately sell everything in your retirement portfolio and put it all in that one stock.

562
01:02:12,390 --> 01:02:18,060
Even if you trust your brother in law, why would you not do that?

563
01:02:21,060 --> 01:02:25,670
But what if that one company went bankrupt?

564
01:02:25,670 --> 01:02:31,130
Your entire portfolio would go to zero. What you'd want to do is you'd want to diversify.

565
01:02:31,140 --> 01:02:38,120
You'd want to say, Well, okay, if I really believe my brother in law that this is the next hot spot, this is the next apple, okay,

566
01:02:38,210 --> 01:02:48,350
maybe I'll put 10% of my retirement portfolio in that and keep 90% spread around among other stocks, mutual funds, bonds, whatever.

567
01:02:49,310 --> 01:02:55,040
Maybe some real estate portfolio as well as you want to diversify.

568
01:02:55,040 --> 01:03:00,950
You know that the returns of different investments are not perfectly correlated with each other.

569
01:03:01,550 --> 01:03:06,380
So you can sort of average out and wash out some of that risk by spreading your money around,

570
01:03:07,370 --> 01:03:13,010
by not putting it all in one stock so you can reduce the risk you face by diversifying,

571
01:03:13,100 --> 01:03:23,180
diversify across stocks, diversifying across U.S. versus international big companies versus small companies, bonds versus stocks and real estate.

572
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:29,720
So since those returns are not perfectly correlated, they may have a correlation coefficient of one.

573
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:41,360
You can decrease the risk you face by diversifying. So risk aversion.

574
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:46,399
We already talked about sort of how it's going to kind of create demand for insurance is risk averse.

575
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:50,150
People are willing to accept a smaller but certain loss,

576
01:03:50,630 --> 01:03:58,730
taking the premium in order to protect themselves against the really painful event suffering the big loss and having to eat it themselves.

577
01:04:00,110 --> 01:04:04,640
So all insurers really do is they they diversify. They diversify across different.

578
01:04:05,820 --> 01:04:07,320
Enrollees in their plan.

579
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:16,000
Blue Cross Blue Shield knows that they're going to have a certain number of people are going to have heart attacks this year that their coverage,

580
01:04:16,010 --> 01:04:18,930
if they cover, you know, 3 million people, the state of Michigan,

581
01:04:19,620 --> 01:04:27,059
they can probably pretty well project that they're going to have, say, 50,000 heart attacks to cover the numbers.

582
01:04:27,060 --> 01:04:33,180
But with 3 million enrollees and a pretty stable set of enrollees from year to year, most of them stay in.

583
01:04:33,180 --> 01:04:39,660
And the ones that leave are replaced by others that are kind of drawn from the same types of people that were that are leaving.

584
01:04:40,260 --> 01:04:47,640
They can project pretty accurately if I cover 3 million people in the state of Michigan, we're going to have to pay for 50,000 heart attacks.

585
01:04:47,970 --> 01:04:52,830
We have no idea which 50,000 those will be. And frankly, it doesn't matter.

586
01:04:56,060 --> 01:04:59,570
So what they're doing is they're diversifying across those 3 million people,

587
01:04:59,570 --> 01:05:03,650
each one of which has a small chance of this catastrophic event happening.

588
01:05:06,810 --> 01:05:10,830
Before we know whether we're going to be the lucky or the unlucky. We put our money in the pot.

589
01:05:14,070 --> 01:05:17,400
And the insurance company is really just diversifying across that risk.

590
01:05:18,630 --> 01:05:21,510
I can't diversify across that risk as an individuals either.

591
01:05:21,510 --> 01:05:25,410
I'm going to have a heart attack this year or I'm not going to have a heart attack this year.

592
01:05:26,340 --> 01:05:30,480
And I don't know on January 1st am I going to be the lucky one or the unlucky one?

593
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:37,290
But financially, I can diversify that risk with other people by putting in a premium that's only a small

594
01:05:37,290 --> 01:05:41,880
fraction of the cost of the heart attack care that I would need if I was the unlucky one.

595
01:05:42,540 --> 01:05:48,330
Will it with the money put in by the other people who don't know whether or not they're going to be the unlucky one that has a heart attack this year?

596
01:05:48,870 --> 01:05:55,800
And there's enough money at the end of the year to pay for all of our heart attack care and for Blue Cross to have enough money to run their business.

597
01:05:57,450 --> 01:06:00,390
And they're hoping to have something left over after that.

598
01:06:04,050 --> 01:06:09,900
So that works well when the chances of loss are independent across enrollees because that really lets diversification work.

599
01:06:10,350 --> 01:06:15,240
Think of the correlation between the likelihood of a heart attack this year and the likelihood of a heart attack this year.

600
01:06:15,990 --> 01:06:22,930
The correlation essentially zero. Me personally, having a heart attack is not predictive of you having a heart attack.

601
01:06:22,940 --> 01:06:28,250
It doesn't protect you from having one. It doesn't cause you to have one. Those are very, very independent risks.

602
01:06:29,270 --> 01:06:33,650
That's what insurers can really operate on, this diversification principle very well.

603
01:06:34,430 --> 01:06:39,920
All they know is by the law of large numbers, if I cover 3 million people, then I know enough about the population I'm covering.

604
01:06:40,190 --> 01:06:46,850
I can know very accurately there's going to be 50,000 heart attacks, plus or minus a very small number this year.

605
01:06:49,940 --> 01:06:54,500
He assures have a harder time with these situations, though.

606
01:06:55,850 --> 01:06:58,910
Heart attacks are easy to diversify because they truly are independent.

607
01:07:00,050 --> 01:07:04,700
One enrollees having a heart attack does not influence another woman's chance of having heart attack.

608
01:07:05,450 --> 01:07:13,900
What about us? I'm sure, yes. Natural disasters. If my house got wiped out by Hurricane Ian last week,

609
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:20,560
is that independent of the probability of my neighbor's house having been wiped out by Hurricane Ian last week?

610
01:07:21,770 --> 01:07:28,549
Now flows rates are very correlated. So if I were a property loss insurer and I was offering hurricane coverage and I decided,

611
01:07:28,550 --> 01:07:32,780
you know what, I'm only going to offer hurricane coverage in Fort Myers Beach.

612
01:07:34,460 --> 01:07:36,980
I'm only going to cover homeowners in Fort Myers Beach.

613
01:07:38,030 --> 01:07:46,200
I've massively failed the diversification principle because most years I'm going to pay zero claims for hurricane damages most years.

614
01:07:46,220 --> 01:07:53,660
Fort Myers Beach is not affected by a hurricane, but in 2022, I'm screwed.

615
01:07:55,190 --> 01:07:59,479
So I'm better off capital. Big, big, big loss reserve to pay those claims.

616
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:02,360
Otherwise, holders are going to I'm going to have a bet.

617
01:08:02,360 --> 01:08:06,590
I'm going to be bankrupt insurer and they're going to file claims and there is not going to be money to pay them.

618
01:08:07,850 --> 01:08:13,610
So if I'm in an area of business where I'm covering correlated risks,

619
01:08:13,610 --> 01:08:20,990
where one of my enrollees having the bad event is actually predictive of other enrollees having that bad event,

620
01:08:21,710 --> 01:08:29,630
I better cover Louisiana and cover North Carolina and cover Texas and cover different parts of Florida.

621
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:35,969
So I'm diversifying across the geography is within a geography.

622
01:08:35,970 --> 01:08:41,190
There's an incredibly high correlation between one enrollee violent claim and other enrollees.

623
01:08:41,190 --> 01:08:44,280
Following contagious disease is another example.

624
01:08:44,610 --> 01:08:49,719
So. There's a big contagion over 19.

625
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:56,380
Obviously, you know, by getting COVID 19 is going to be correlated with your getting it because it's transmissible.

626
01:08:56,470 --> 01:08:58,480
Heart attacks are not transmissible in that way.

627
01:08:59,110 --> 01:09:08,409
So insurers are have to be a little more careful about covering contagious risks than are attacks and cancers and things

628
01:09:08,410 --> 01:09:18,280
that tend to be very uncorrelated across enrollees in something like Knitting Digest or something that they wouldn't cover.

629
01:09:20,170 --> 01:09:25,239
So one way they could deal with it by simply saying, we're not covering certain things.

630
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:30,910
Certain things are excluded. And sometimes like acts of war would be excluded from insurance policies for exactly that reason.

631
01:09:32,110 --> 01:09:37,090
But if you're in the business of writing hurricane insurance or fire insurance or flood insurance,

632
01:09:37,660 --> 01:09:43,690
you're in the business of covering natural disasters. You can't just say, I'm offering hurricane insurance, but hurricane damage is excluded.

633
01:09:45,010 --> 01:09:48,370
So then you have to say, well, I'm not going to cover just hurricane damage in one town,

634
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:54,640
because if if a hurricane, bad hurricane strikes that town this year, I'm not going to be able to pay the claims.

635
01:09:55,660 --> 01:09:58,660
I will not have collected enough premiums to pay out.

636
01:09:58,660 --> 01:10:05,320
So that's heart attacks for Blue Cross. I reflect a little bit of money from everybody to cover the heart attack here,

637
01:10:05,680 --> 01:10:12,159
and I can know with almost near certainty that I've collected enough money to pay for this year's heart attack.

638
01:10:12,160 --> 01:10:17,140
Here in my population, we're only covering for Fort Myers Beach.

639
01:10:18,830 --> 01:10:22,430
I'm either going to pay nothing this year or I'm going to be totally screwed.

640
01:10:24,830 --> 01:10:29,510
So I better diversify across geographies or not get in that line of business.

641
01:10:34,190 --> 01:10:38,570
And so let's change our example just a little bit to insurance.

642
01:10:39,140 --> 01:10:47,000
So now the initial income is $15,000, and so it's a 20% chance of facing a $10,000 loss.

643
01:10:47,690 --> 01:10:54,890
So I've got $15,000 and 20% of the time I incur some damage of $10,000.

644
01:10:55,670 --> 01:10:56,629
It's health insurance.

645
01:10:56,630 --> 01:11:04,400
It's some health care that I need and homeowner's insurance, it's property damage, car insurance, whatever type of insurance it might be.

646
01:11:05,250 --> 01:11:08,540
We do ask, well, what's the actuarially fair insurance premium?

647
01:11:09,350 --> 01:11:17,240
And that's defined as the premium that if the insurance company collected it from a whole bunch of enrollees facing this risk,

648
01:11:17,660 --> 01:11:24,350
they would have collected just enough money in aggregate to pay out the claims that they're going to receive in the year.

649
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:35,450
So recovering, say, a million people with this risk, I collect $2,000 from each one of them or 200,000 of them are going to experience a loss,

650
01:11:35,450 --> 01:11:39,230
plus or minus a very, very small amount to the law of large numbers.

651
01:11:40,430 --> 01:11:43,970
And I've collected just enough money to pay back all the claims.

652
01:11:45,710 --> 01:11:50,150
Now, I haven't collected enough money to actually run my business or earn a profit at the end of the year.

653
01:11:51,530 --> 01:11:56,990
But I've at least collected enough money if I'm charging the RFP that I'm going to be able to pay out the claims that show up.

654
01:11:58,670 --> 01:12:03,590
So the fee is just the expected value of the loss of the insurer is liable for.

655
01:12:04,160 --> 01:12:08,990
So if it's a 100% insurance policy, in other words, they're liable for the complete loss.

656
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:16,490
They've got to collect $2,000 from every enrollee to have enough money over the year to pay for the claims that come in.

657
01:12:18,110 --> 01:12:21,260
Now, also, look at it from the perspective of an individual enrollee.

658
01:12:22,770 --> 01:12:29,010
So same utility of income function we had before dabbling over the same points.

659
01:12:29,820 --> 01:12:34,920
Either I don't have a loss, I keep my $15,000.

660
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:38,190
My utility is 36. I do have the loss.

661
01:12:38,730 --> 01:12:42,810
I only got $5,000 left after the loss. My utility is 20.

662
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:48,560
What's my expected utility if I don't buy any insurance?

663
01:12:49,940 --> 01:12:54,590
Can I do it the same way you do the gamble where it connects the bad and the good outcomes.

664
01:12:55,190 --> 01:13:00,709
No loss loss with the cord. But now I say, well, where are we going to be on average?

665
01:13:00,710 --> 01:13:07,280
On average we're on we're going to be 80% of the way up towards the good outcome because now there's only a 20% chance of a loss.

666
01:13:08,090 --> 01:13:12,440
Think of it as. Probability point eight.

667
01:13:12,440 --> 01:13:15,470
You're their probability point to hear their.

668
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:21,160
So on average. They're going to be there.

669
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:30,190
So how do we know that? I've got an average income of $13,000, which is 80% of the time.

670
01:13:30,190 --> 01:13:33,850
I keep my whole $15,000. I didn't experience the loss.

671
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:40,340
20% of the time. I experience the loss.

672
01:13:40,340 --> 01:13:47,400
I only have $10,000 left. On average, my income is 13,000.

673
01:13:47,420 --> 01:13:52,520
If I'm taking my chances uninsured, it's never going to actually be 13,000 either.

674
01:13:52,520 --> 01:13:56,570
I'll be lucky and keep the whole 15 or unlucky and be all the way down to five.

675
01:13:56,990 --> 01:14:00,890
But at the beginning of the year, when I'm contemplating, do I buy this policy or not?

676
01:14:01,340 --> 01:14:10,700
I say, Well, if I don't buy this policy, on average, I'll have $13,000 and I'll never actually end up with 13,000 if I don't have a policy.

677
01:14:11,180 --> 01:14:17,660
But on average, I expect to have that. Another way of thinking about it as well.

678
01:14:17,990 --> 01:14:23,780
We figured out already the average loss is $2,000. 20% of the time I lose 10,000.

679
01:14:25,100 --> 01:14:30,020
My original income was $15,000. So on average, I lose $2,000.

680
01:14:30,860 --> 01:14:36,140
So that's the expected value of the loss. What's 15 minus two?

681
01:14:36,170 --> 01:14:43,340
It's 13. So we could have either way, either by doing this calculation or by just say saying,

682
01:14:43,340 --> 01:14:48,440
well, on average, I lose 2000, so let's subtract that from my original 15%.

683
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:53,980
On average, I'm going to be left with 13,000. So there is my situation.

684
01:14:53,990 --> 01:15:01,490
If I don't buy the policy, I'm either going to be here or 80% of the time, 20% of time I'm going to be here.

685
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:13,880
The average value is I'm going to have an income of $13,000 and a utility of whatever that number is, not the expected value.

686
01:15:14,030 --> 01:15:19,640
Expect a utility uninsured. Now, insurance companies really generous.

687
01:15:19,650 --> 01:15:23,930
They're not worried about covering their costs of doing business. They're not worried about making a profit.

688
01:15:24,290 --> 01:15:29,350
They come along and say, hey, I see you face this 20% chance of losing $10,000.

689
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:32,660
I'm going to cover you for the actuarially fair premium.

690
01:15:33,110 --> 01:15:39,070
I'm only going to charge you $2,000. Essentially I'm giving you insurance for free.

691
01:15:39,150 --> 01:15:48,500
Right. So on average, you get all your money back. I'm charging you $2,000, but you expect to collect $2,000 of claims from me.

692
01:15:49,220 --> 01:15:53,000
So essentially, by charging you the AFP, I'm insuring you for nothing.

693
01:15:55,020 --> 01:16:00,020
I. Policyholders as a group are getting back every single penny of premiums they paid.

694
01:16:01,490 --> 01:16:10,280
20% of them are going to get back $10,000 in all the premiums I collected, all the money that I put, this jar is going back out.

695
01:16:11,960 --> 01:16:18,560
So all the money everybody puts in this jar for premiums is going out to the 20% who experienced the loss as a benefit.

696
01:16:19,910 --> 01:16:25,300
Am I going to buy this policy? Heck yes.

697
01:16:26,680 --> 01:16:30,830
If I buy that policy, what's my income going to be?

698
01:16:30,850 --> 01:16:33,580
It'll be $13,000 for sure.

699
01:16:35,240 --> 01:16:43,969
Because 80% of the time I get lucky and don't experience the loss and well, I've paid the $2,000 premium, so I'm not going to have 15,000.

700
01:16:43,970 --> 01:16:47,090
Any more than 2000 premium has gone. I've got 13,000.

701
01:16:48,630 --> 01:16:51,840
20% of time I experienced the $10,000 loss.

702
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:56,250
But who pays for it? Insurance company. So I still keep my $13,000.

703
01:16:57,060 --> 01:17:03,420
So by buying that policy, I've locked in a guaranteed $13,000, no matter whether I have the loss or not.

704
01:17:04,440 --> 01:17:15,150
As a risk averse person. That is a deal. The utility of having $13,000 for sure is definitely higher than the expected utility of taking my chances.

705
01:17:16,350 --> 01:17:19,080
What if my insurance company's not quite that nice?

706
01:17:19,980 --> 01:17:26,040
He's like, No, we've got just the costs of running our business, and we'd kind of like to make a profit at the end of the year.

707
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:32,790
We don't like this deal of like paying out 100% of the premiums that we collected as claims to our enrollees.

708
01:17:35,370 --> 01:17:38,940
If that was my business model as an insurer, would you invest in my insurance company?

709
01:17:40,050 --> 01:17:43,740
Would you put your retirement money in my insurance company? If my business model is,

710
01:17:44,070 --> 01:17:52,500
I'm charging the actuarially fair premium so that I'm providing insurance for free by paying out 100% of premiums as claims to my enrollees.

711
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:57,270
No, but I'd buy your policy. Yes, exactly. You buy my policy, but you wouldn't invest in my company.

712
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:04,500
So now the insurance company has to ask itself, well, what's the most somebody would be willing to pay?

713
01:18:07,240 --> 01:18:16,570
For my policy and we can kind of do that the same way we did when he said, well, this person might pay $2,000 to avoid that $5,000 coin toss.

714
01:18:17,080 --> 01:18:19,990
We can say what amount of money, if they had it for sure,

715
01:18:20,350 --> 01:18:25,360
would leave them with a utility the same as their expected utility of saying thanks but no thanks.

716
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:27,400
I'm going to take my chances without the policy.

717
01:18:29,050 --> 01:18:39,070
So we're just going to go at the height of the utility are insured and it's the expected utility and they're taking

718
01:18:39,070 --> 01:18:48,460
their chances to go over horizontally until we hit the utility of income for drop down with the amount of money.

719
01:18:49,090 --> 01:18:59,360
And that says if this person had $12,000 guaranteed no risk, their utility of either same as their expected utility of taking their chances uninsured.

720
01:19:00,340 --> 01:19:05,200
So I'd argue this person be willing to pay up to $1,000 beyond the actuarially

721
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:10,630
fair premium to avoid the risk they'd be indifferent to a $3,000 premium,

722
01:19:11,530 --> 01:19:15,520
which is a thousand more than the AFP or is going from 15 to 12 for sure.

723
01:19:16,870 --> 01:19:18,040
We're taking their chances.

724
01:19:18,490 --> 01:19:32,860
If I offer the policy at 2500, hey, they're in 2500 would guarantee them an income of 12,500 and that's better than their that utility of 12,500.

725
01:19:32,860 --> 01:19:41,260
Guaranteed no risk because they bought the policy is the same as sorry is greater than their expected utility of being uninsured.

726
01:19:43,330 --> 01:19:53,799
So clearly they're going to pay the AFP. Clearly no insurer is going to offer them at the RFP and there's a limit to how much they pay above the AFP.

727
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:58,650
That limit is about $1,000 more on this graph. It's a $12,000.
