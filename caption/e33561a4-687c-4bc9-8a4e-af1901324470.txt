1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:06,440
Quarterly results the title companies and scope.

2
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:27,330
There you go. Okay. Well, I will try to try to do one sitting and then I start attempting to.

3
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:35,250
But this is a this will be yeah, this is going to work if working.

4
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:38,850
This is much better than it used to be. Okay.

5
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:43,950
Well, I guess we can advance here if I were you.

6
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:51,700
Okay. So we're going to go over the situation.

7
00:00:52,840 --> 00:01:06,880
We're going to start at the start of the 21st century because the year of 2003 was a very eventful one,

8
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:23,680
because in the same year we had the first czars and also we had the beginning of the H5N1 avian influenza spread.

9
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:34,299
And that got everybody scared because it was thought it might be the cause of the next pandemic.

10
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:39,850
And it was quite lethal when that virus infected humans.

11
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:46,040
In fact, it didn't spread all that well to humans, which is why we escaped.

12
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:56,499
But I'll tell you the advantage that the word development that was very helpful, that resulted from that pandemic,

13
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:13,490
which was totally forgotten when we got to the start of the current SARS-CoV-2 to COVID 19 pandemic, when the deputy director of science at CDC.

14
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:16,720
At the first press conference said,

15
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:31,990
dust off your pandemic plans because and plans were there and nobody had updated them or anything since 2009 when we had a very mild flu pandemic.

16
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,820
So we're going to review that. We're going to talk about pandemic planning.

17
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:48,520
We'll talk about the 2009 influenza pandemic, the fact that because there was milder than expected, it made people complacent.

18
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:56,650
We'll talk about SARS-CoV-2, the early timeline, and then we'll talk about controls.

19
00:02:57,490 --> 00:03:08,170
And I will concentrate on the most critical element and control besides non-pharmaceutical interventions, and that is vaccines.

20
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:13,810
And if we have time and you ask the right questions,

21
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:24,190
I can tell you a little bit about what I learned retrospectively about the politics of rolling out the vaccine in Truth thousand.

22
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:28,510
The year 2020 in the middle of a presidential election.

23
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:35,200
So let's see if we can forward the SA's timeline.

24
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:46,750
And this had an impact here because there was sporadic spread to various places in the world.

25
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:55,660
It's quite clear it came from a live animal market analysis in Gwangju.

26
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:06,080
And it spread from there. And where it's spread, it spread quite effectively.

27
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:12,950
Probably because of superspreaders. But it did not spread that efficiently.

28
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:24,750
We now know in retrospect. So what started out and gone wrong done spread to Hong Kong, Vietnam, Singapore and Toronto.

29
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:33,950
So the University of Michigan got very concerned because of students going to Toronto for partying or whatever.

30
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:39,890
You could drink at 28, at 18 and in Ontario.

31
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:48,440
And so we had quite a planning session here about what to advise students.

32
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:56,780
The first Canadian case was diagnosed in March of 2003.

33
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,810
And they didn't know what they were dealing with.

34
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:15,160
They diagnosed the case as possibly tuberculosis and left the individual in the emergency room not under isolation for looking for a bed for it,

35
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:22,880
for a police report, and for about 24 hours, which is how it all started to spread in Toronto.

36
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:31,310
Vancouver had importations as well from basically from the Hong Kong area.

37
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:36,829
And it didn't take off. The CDC opened an emergency center.

38
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:47,180
Everybody was really concerned. A number of us, including me, were on in the media saying, you can't put the genie back in the bottle.

39
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:55,760
And guess what? With only non-pharmaceutical interventions, it was stopped vaccines.

40
00:05:55,850 --> 00:06:00,560
They started to develop vaccine. They started to develop anti-virals.

41
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:07,640
And they were shelved because this had this refusal to support a single event.

42
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:15,260
And by July 923, they lifted all restrictions.

43
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:26,179
And I actually when I was I arrived in Beijing the first day, they didn't have any new cases.

44
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:30,230
So I was viewed as being very being very lucky.

45
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:48,440
Lucky for that is, uh, the interesting thing about the SaaS and in retrospect it was like more or less like to the way it started before it evolved.

46
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:58,610
And it was very clear the shedding was late 5 to 7 days into the illness.

47
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:06,620
It didn't spread all that well to children. Does this sound like how all this started and then it evolved?

48
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:12,080
So we are dealing now with with a similar virus that has evolved.

49
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,749
So it's become much more efficient.

50
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:28,530
The spread is now involving children who are causing family outbreaks as the virus becomes more transmissible and probably less lethal,

51
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:32,959
although that's hard to say. So influenza shedding is early.

52
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:41,840
You're always worried about asymptomatic cases. And we were lulled by the occurrence of stars into thinking that there was not a whole

53
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:47,690
lot of asymptomatic transmission because there wasn't with the original source.

54
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:52,700
And that's how the shedding pattern evolves with stars.

55
00:07:53,960 --> 00:08:01,220
And the problem, the biggest problem they had besides being in nursing homes was in hospitals.

56
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:06,680
They didn't know. They weren't using just regular precautions.

57
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:17,090
And there were they were passing nasogastric tubes and things like that and aerosol.

58
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:35,690
And a lot of the cases were in the hospital. And this is from that time says survives on surfaces which was the excuse here for all the hand hygiene

59
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:41,560
we had at the beginning of the pandemic and running out of disinfectants and things like that,

60
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:47,709
and primarily coughing, sneezing infections.

61
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:54,040
And it was not clear that there wasn't a whole lot of aerosol transmission,

62
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:59,770
which would not be as effectively stopped by this as large droplet transmission.

63
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:06,130
Which explains why, in part, at the start of this pandemic,

64
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:15,430
there was not the emphasis on face masks that we have now, empirical evidence that it's really effective.

65
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:21,500
Possibly airborne spread in some situations.

66
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:29,720
You know, the chain effect that's super spreading. And this is from a newspaper in Singapore where they had a big outbreak.

67
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,940
And age distribution of cases. This is from Beijing.

68
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:43,140
The case definition was pneumonia, lower respiratory infections.

69
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:48,210
That's all they had because they did have tests available.

70
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:56,650
This is the start of PCR. So there was not good identification of the infected.

71
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:07,419
Okay. So at the end of the same year, avian influenza and we now have H5N1 in the United States,

72
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:13,010
which we never had in North America before, and it's in backyard flocks.

73
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:29,170
There was one outbreak, I think, in Kalamazoo. And what we learned there in retrospect was it doesn't transmit that well from chickens to people.

74
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:34,300
It's very it's high pathogenic in chickens.

75
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:47,440
And there were cases and there still are sporadic cases and some degree of secondary transmission from those cases, but not extensive.

76
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:53,730
We didn't know that at the time because it was spreading. It spread all the way to Europe.

77
00:10:53,740 --> 00:11:00,930
We never had it in the Americas, but they had it swans in Germany and other.

78
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:06,970
And I don't think they had any human cases outside of Asia.

79
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:15,940
There's still, I think, reasonable transmission from time to time in Egypt and in other places in the Middle East.

80
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:22,590
But it is typically confined to those that have contact.

81
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:26,970
Direct contact with chickens just never took off.

82
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:32,040
But the reason it's important, among other things,

83
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:44,400
is also as a cautionary note that if you don't if you don't think that somebody is going to act differently the next time it comes your way,

84
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:47,970
you're losing a lot of time to get ready.

85
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:58,860
Was the fact that there was a major push in the United States to get ready for a pandemic because there

86
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:10,080
was no telling when we first recognized it that it was going to be unable to really transmit well,

87
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:21,930
humans. And besides that, there was Hurricane Katrina which occurred that this was going on in 2005,

88
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:30,149
and the Bush administration decided they were going to show that they knew that the public needed to

89
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:36,390
be protected after they got in political trouble for not responding properly to Hurricane Katrina.

90
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:41,270
And there was a lot of money put into pandemic requirement.

91
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:51,600
And this is the report. And you can see all the agencies of the federal government with their logos at the bottom signing off on this document.

92
00:12:51,750 --> 00:13:00,360
This is the document that was mentioned in terms of DOD dust off your pandemic clearance.

93
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:04,320
And there were three pillars to pandemic control.

94
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:08,640
And this was flu vaccines.

95
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:14,910
It was thought, what if you're not going to have a vaccine until six or eight months,

96
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:22,050
even if it's just the flu vaccine that you're replacing, knowing what the technology is and you've got the virus.

97
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:31,760
And there's already worry that it could it would not be delivered to the developing world.

98
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:41,360
And we repeated this over and over again. Still no solution to getting equitable distribution of vaccines.

99
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:53,530
We did have antivirals for flu, and that is the reason why there is even now a stockpile of typically Tamiflu.

100
00:13:54,030 --> 00:14:05,890
Also, it's happened with some zanamivir, which is the other one, which is inhaled because it's less likely to be subject to antiviral resistance.

101
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:16,660
And the plan was that it was going to be used before a vaccine became available and then non-pharmaceutical interventions.

102
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:18,830
And there was a lot of study,

103
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:30,130
historic looking at the 1918 flu pandemic to figure out what level of non-pharmaceutical interventions were going to be used.

104
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:37,690
Now, the response was filled to be be based on severity,

105
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:47,290
and there are five categories of hurricanes and therefore there were five categories of influenza.

106
00:14:49,140 --> 00:15:01,080
Severity. And it was based not on the attack rate, which was felt to be pretty uniform, but by case fatality.

107
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:07,230
And in reality, it probably should have been three levels mild, moderate, severe.

108
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:17,429
And you will read when they talk about what were some of the past pandemics that that people thought was so important,

109
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:23,990
1 to 2 and 4 to 5, because really it should have been collapsed.

110
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,590
You can't really fine tune it the way it is here.

111
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:36,060
But again, this is because pandemics, because of the five categories of hurricanes.

112
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:47,900
And this is the interesting part, the response and this is see, even here, it's one, 2 to 3, 4 to 5.

113
00:15:50,060 --> 00:16:01,670
And the response in terms of the non-pharmaceutical interventions should be based on the severity, which makes total sense.

114
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:05,780
You're not going to close schools.

115
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:20,410
Come up with social distancing. All these germs that are common now were more or less invented to deal with this situation, worrying about it.

116
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:28,520
And there were there was a lot of money put into this in terms of getting the public buy in and having working

117
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:34,900
groups of mirrors to try to figure out what happens if you close schools and you don't have school lunch break.

118
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,240
So things of this.

119
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:56,840
So this was readied and people in the and the history those that work here in the history of pandemics looked at how well things worked in 1918,

120
00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:12,260
why the city of Philadelphia had a major outbreak following the Liberty Bond parade, where there was a lot of human to human contact.

121
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:16,790
And that justified a lot of the proposals that they made.

122
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:22,800
And what happened then? And this and this.

123
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:34,460
The point was this. And this is. It doesn't seem to work every time there was flattening the curve.

124
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:43,070
And there's that. And these are old brought back now with flattening the curve.

125
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:51,350
But the difference is nobody and nobody at the start of this pandemic thought it was going to go on for a couple of years.

126
00:17:51,950 --> 00:18:03,380
The idea with a flu pandemic is flu tip. Pandemics typically go through six or eight months and then the virus becomes the season, the new seasonal.

127
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:11,730
And that's what you're dealing with now, something that has just gone on for very much longer.

128
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:15,840
And why do you think that's the case?

129
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:20,710
But. Yeah.

130
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:27,330
Know with very little, you know, human resources and fairly long life.

131
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:32,050
Absolutely. That's the point. There's no immunity in the population.

132
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:37,620
You have you have a totally novel virus with flu.

133
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:48,000
There are variants, basically. But at least some parts of the population have had experience with the virus.

134
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:52,350
There's probably T-cell immunity and things like that that are broader.

135
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:59,170
And that to me, is the major reason this has gone on for as long as it has.

136
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:04,440
And we're hoping that things are getting a little more quiescent now,

137
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:14,459
in spite of the fact that large parts of our population are not are not as vaccinated as they should be.

138
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:18,090
They're not vaccinated or not up to date with their vaccines.

139
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,580
But with the spread now,

140
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:31,080
I think we're finally getting to the point where things are calming down and becoming much more like a seasonal influenza virus,

141
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:35,130
staying with us, but being more manageable.

142
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:39,320
And this is what people were doing.

143
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:49,880
They were looking at this as 1918 where things worked and how they worked in order to come up with enormous pharmaceutical interventions,

144
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:56,960
which people forgot where they started with that it was all worked out and agencies had signed off.

145
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:10,920
Now W.H.O. has an important role in this, which it still does not really fulfill.

146
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:19,770
Don't get me going about W.H.O. The problem is the W.H.O. has turned out, like everything else,

147
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:28,919
to be a reasonably political organization and a poor one at that because it has to be supported by

148
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:36,920
the member states and it really hasn't had the role that it should in trying to manage these things.

149
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,850
But the critical thing,

150
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:48,750
and this is an important thing that W.H.O. has done is there are the international health regulations were put put in place in 2005,

151
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:53,250
and it's a treaty obligation of the member states to report.

152
00:20:57,170 --> 00:21:01,820
And that is the major, major advance.

153
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:07,400
And everybody thought the next pandemic was going to be flu.

154
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:10,910
These were the phases that were set up.

155
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:21,030
Why W.H.O. And the concern was.

156
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:33,970
That it was going to come from animals. And the key point is, is phase four sustained human to human transmission?

157
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:43,830
Because, you know, you're going to have sporadic transmission of some of these avian flu viruses, pig flu viruses to people.

158
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:57,110
But it was just sustaining the sustained transmission and then geographic spread.

159
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:06,440
Phase six was the full pandemic. And just to show that you're dealing with a bureaucracy,

160
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:21,290
phase five was this epidemic spread in one W.H.O. region, and phase six was spread in two W.H.O. regions.

161
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:34,820
And I don't know how much you know about W.H.O. regions, but they're set up in a political in a semi apolitical way, PAHO.

162
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:39,500
Pan American Health Organization is the same as the American region, and that makes sense.

163
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:50,590
But some of the islands that still belong to the Caribbean, that still belong to the European countries are part of the European region.

164
00:22:52,570 --> 00:23:03,729
You've got the European region based in Copenhagen, which goes all the way to the end of the year, to the start of the Pacific Ocean,

165
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:05,920
because the former Soviet Union,

166
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:17,530
former Soviet Union was part of the European regions and all of the former Soviet countries are part of the European region.

167
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:22,570
So it's not a G, it's not geographic except for something like the Americas.

168
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:29,200
And you're. And Africa.

169
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:37,880
Poor Alex. So what happened with the flu pandemic of 2009?

170
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:44,200
And you people, do you remember the 2008 pandemic?

171
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:51,959
It turned out to be much milder than anybody anticipated.

172
00:23:51,960 --> 00:24:01,650
And the reason was that this was a modified H1 N1 virus.

173
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:12,390
So it was a virus that anybody who was more than 40 or 50 years of age had had experience with.

174
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:19,560
And we really didn't see severe mortality in older people, which is typical of the flu pandemic.

175
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,600
We did have school aged school openings.

176
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:29,259
Because younger people didn't have any experience.

177
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:41,470
But still it was relatively mild, it was severe and made it in indigenous populations, especially the first wave.

178
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:59,470
So W.H.O. pandemic phases and I happened to be one of 15 people globally to be on the W.H.O. advisory committee led by the director general.

179
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:12,340
We all this is all done by phone. I think I was the only civilian non-government person to be in the W.H.O. emergency

180
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:22,840
committee and it went very fast because it really had taken off Mexico until phase five,

181
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:27,310
because there's clear transmission in the Americas.

182
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:32,310
Originated in Mexico, phase six.

183
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:47,549
It waited a long time and we all knew there was transmission in the UK, in Spain and Japan, but they weren't, which were in different W.H.O. regions,

184
00:25:47,550 --> 00:26:00,570
but they were reporting it while they were finalizing their contract through vaccine delivery, which had clauses in that which would.

185
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:10,829
That would make it difficult to do that once you had full phase six or the declaration of a pandemic.

186
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:18,870
So that's why we went from April 29 to June 11 to declare phase six because

187
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:22,080
the committee can't meet and the director general doesn't call the meeting.

188
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:29,090
And this is what the pandemic looked like in the United States.

189
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:32,530
Spring wave. Anybody who was in Ann Arbor,

190
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:43,340
no knew we had a spring wave was in major cities and then the rural areas of the south for the fall away and a dip down over the summer.

191
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:54,980
So this is and again, not a whole lot of severity.

192
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,220
Very limited number of deaths use.

193
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:11,450
Pregnant women were particularly vulnerable and indigenous populations were also the most vulnerable.

194
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:15,320
And they started using antivirals around the fall wave hit.

195
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:25,160
And many of those areas, they had the antivirals deployed and they did Canadians in the north,

196
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:29,690
they had body by ship in body bags, which they needed in the fall.

197
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:37,730
In the spring, they didn't have the fall. Okay, now let's go forward.

198
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:44,680
And talk about stars of the stars time.

199
00:27:45,070 --> 00:28:07,240
And this is the official title. And it was on December 31st of 2019 that the country office in China picked up reports from Wuhan of viral pneumonia.

200
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:15,860
And I don't want to go into this and get into the debate about what happened.

201
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:20,960
The one thing we know was it was not.

202
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,870
Reported quickly enough.

203
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:38,730
And a lot of the reason was I don't think they really knew because of the bureaucracy and not not wanting to give bad news.

204
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:44,340
A lot of it was. That.

205
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:50,340
But also there was some reluctance to talk about.

206
00:28:53,200 --> 00:29:04,390
The genetic sequence got out surreptitiously around January the 11th, which made it possible to start working on vaccines.

207
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:14,379
And that's the key here. The first case was already reported outside of China, in Thailand on the 13th of January.

208
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:22,510
So there had to be significant local transmission if it was being transmitted outside the country.

209
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:27,470
15th in Japan, first case of the US,

210
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:38,830
the 21st and the public health emergency called the activated the international health regulations on January the third.

211
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:53,250
So it took the whole month of January. There's a lot of debate about the coincidence of having a lab working on stars,

212
00:29:53,490 --> 00:30:08,130
the original stars in on and the fact that it was never it was treated as a food, a having a single source at the market.

213
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:21,210
But it's not clear how the transmission emerged from the market, especially since the imports of the biology are very early.

214
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:25,890
It's pretty clear it was its it's.

215
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:31,320
When you hear about oh, it was around in the fall or early fall, it really was.

216
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:35,580
There's no evidence. Okay.

217
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:41,980
So how do we look at the three pillars in terms of COVID control?

218
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:51,320
I know we don't need to spend a whole lot of time on this because it's pretty obvious what we've all.

219
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:59,050
Dramatic effect with non for pharmaceutical interventions.

220
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:11,049
Which is very interesting. I just it's very I think what we all know the non-pharmaceutical interventions a lot of without masking and

221
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:18,760
things like that with the way the virus has evolved wouldn't be working as well now as it was earlier.

222
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:26,110
And there was evidence of superspreading. The characteristics.

223
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:32,220
The transmissibility of the virus has really changed with the development of the variants.

224
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:40,580
And again, the Non-Pharmaceutical interventions had to be a lot longer than those originally.

225
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:45,850
And the adult virals are still a major get.

226
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:59,590
I have it on reasonable authority that it's going to turn out that some of the antivirals we are currently using typically exploded.

227
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:08,460
They were tested originally in unvaccinated individuals.

228
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:18,960
It seems like there's not as much of a dramatic effect in the breakthrough infections that are a lot of what we're seeing nowadays.

229
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:29,540
So we don't have the greatest antivirals still and therapeutics.

230
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:34,010
As soon as you get drifting you're ahead of bodies don't work that all that well.

231
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:44,150
So do some don't and vaccines were not nearly as delayed as we should have.

232
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:50,270
Ideally requires two doses of the flu novel flu virus.

233
00:32:52,100 --> 00:33:06,020
And I put this in quite, quite some time ago before we have what we're having right now with the with new a new bivalent vaccine containing the.

234
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:13,239
And this was the airborne spread the argument about airborne spread.

235
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:19,150
And that's why I told you about you were saying we don't need to mask, we need to hand wash our hands.

236
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:27,370
And then as evidence increased. And also, they wanted to save the masks for the health care workers.

237
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,600
And he's being dragged on for changing his mind.

238
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,780
But the evidence really wasn't all that solid.

239
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:38,020
There was still a lot of people debating this.

240
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:45,970
So the antivirals therapeutics, the big breakthrough was a very simple one.

241
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:53,200
Everybody have been saying that.

242
00:33:54,740 --> 00:34:00,170
Steroids were banned. The treatment of infectious disease.

243
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:12,889
And there was a lot of effort to try to get us to get the steroids not be used because

244
00:34:12,890 --> 00:34:21,380
they were having people who had a silent tuberculosis disseminating and things like that.

245
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:35,120
It turned out that with the kind of immune mechanisms triggered by SARS-CoV-2, that dexamethasone,

246
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:45,140
which is a simple steroid that's cheap and available, was the first specific therapeutic that made a big difference.

247
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:48,170
There's no question that it made a big difference.

248
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:58,160
And that's why if you were fortunate enough to get infected at the first wave, you did a lot less well than you did later on.

249
00:34:58,610 --> 00:35:10,960
What they learned in a lot of things is because it was it was learning on the job as spread started back in late March and April of that.

250
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:25,910
The convalescent plasma. The idea first was because they had cases and when you take plasma from them and use it now we've got monoclonal antibodies,

251
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:34,500
polyclonal and all the rest. But with the electron variant, some are working and some are now.

252
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:49,370
Okay. Now we'll talk about vaccines and we'll spend the rest of our time, except maybe at the end talking about vaccines.

253
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:58,150
It says ideally requires two doses. Well, I would change that now to say three.

254
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:11,229
Because one of the things that is very clear, that with overcrowding there was relatively low levels of protection with two doses,

255
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:20,470
but with the third dose, you've got more and more general immunity, broader immunity.

256
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:26,020
And there is a reasonable effect of if you've had three.

257
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:35,320
Which is unfortunate because when you get here that 70 or 80% of Americans are vaccinated, they're talking about two doses.

258
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:44,920
And I'm not even sure if they're just talking about one dose with the infamous JNJ vaccine, which we're going to talk about.

259
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:59,380
And one of the few lucky things that we had with SARS-CoV-2, unlike influenza,

260
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:07,000
remember, everyone's a vaccine and is basically standardized by the hemagglutinin.

261
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:19,600
13 micrograms of hemoglobin and you don't even have a requirement for the other surface energy in the neuraminidase in the United States.

262
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:38,550
And we have discovered that you can get high levels of protection with just the spike protein of his workers.

263
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,730
And that was the big surprise.

264
00:37:47,150 --> 00:38:04,580
It's turning out that some of the other vaccines that are not in this schematic of the typical of vaccines that are being used,

265
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:09,660
the inactivated virus and all the rest,

266
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:17,480
the more traditional vaccines may be with several with a number of doses more pretty efficacious,

267
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:24,020
not efficacious as the M RNA vaccines were first administered.

268
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:39,160
And we still don't know if the way it occurs with the MMR and vaccines is more typical of those vaccines or just typical of a community.

269
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:50,989
Simply because there have not been nearly as many good studies done with the other vaccines,

270
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:59,060
which are basically be done be being used in low resourced areas in the rest.

271
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:05,910
As with some of the vaccines we're going to be talking about here.

272
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:27,050
So. What are the three vaccines which have been used and the three classes of vaccines that have been used in the United States?

273
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:32,240
Approved in the United States. Authorized in the United States.

274
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:43,890
And in industrialized countries, number one is protein based, but not the traditional.

275
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:54,340
The Novavax vaccine is the typical one that just got licensed.

276
00:39:56,090 --> 00:40:07,100
Or I'd like, just got authorized. And that's based on taking and getting back to little viruses to express.

277
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:13,560
The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.

278
00:40:15,490 --> 00:40:20,920
So it is a really a recombinant vaccine, but it's a protein vaccine.

279
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:34,090
It's not like taking the whole virus and inactivated yet, which is what is being used in some of the vaccines that are.

280
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:41,600
Made available in the developed world, developing world.

281
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:52,280
Number two is viral vector typically a non replicating and no virus.

282
00:40:52,280 --> 00:41:05,390
You hitch the sequence on to the head no virus and inject that and the body that makes.

283
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:10,890
The spike protein had a response to.

284
00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:18,910
So that's why it's like. And the JNJ vaccine.

285
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:23,890
And the AstraZeneca vaccine,

286
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:36,340
which never was approved in the United States but has been used extensively in large parts of the world, are examples of that.

287
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:43,300
And then the one we're most familiar with, we have RNA vaccines.

288
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:49,900
You're the M&A is what attracted.

289
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:57,670
And which uses. Protection.

290
00:41:57,910 --> 00:42:02,290
Production of the spike. Protein and response.

291
00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:17,200
And this is an old one. It's a question of speed.

292
00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:21,420
One of the reasons the vaccines were pursued.

293
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:27,489
Again, good luck that they were pursued most actively.

294
00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:31,340
Because they are. The quickest.

295
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:44,360
To produce. I can tell you that as of June the 28th,

296
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:55,820
when the vaccines and related Biologics Advisory Committee discussed and made

297
00:42:55,820 --> 00:43:04,160
the recommendation that being four or five overcrowded vaccines were to be.

298
00:43:05,990 --> 00:43:09,440
Would be better ones to put in the vaccine.

299
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:19,220
Unlike the W.H.O. recommendation, which was being worn, Moderna hadn't even started to make it.

300
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:28,400
Pfizer had the variant ahead and we were told that it wouldn't be ready until mid-October.

301
00:43:29,930 --> 00:43:36,499
As you know, it was authorized at the very end of August.

302
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:42,690
And we're getting it getting that vaccine now, both Pfizer and Moderna.

303
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:46,370
So it's very simple technology.

304
00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:54,010
Sophisticated technology, but relatively simple technology.

305
00:43:54,930 --> 00:44:02,210
To produce producers. And if it works for.

306
00:44:04,990 --> 00:44:12,130
SARS-CoV-2. Don't assume it's going to work for it, which is what's happening now that they're trying.

307
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:16,570
They've been trying to use the RNA technology for food for a while.

308
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:27,490
I don't know whether it's going to be better techniques or what they're going to try, but it wasn't doing all that well in terms of flu vaccines.

309
00:44:28,070 --> 00:44:34,370
In case you hadn't heard a good year, we get 50% efficacy and effectiveness for flu vaccine.

310
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:37,640
So this is a vaccine that needs improvement.

311
00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:43,510
That's a whole other lecture about flu vaccines and the work that.

312
00:44:46,590 --> 00:44:50,940
And this just, again, talks about nucleic acid vaccines.

313
00:44:51,480 --> 00:45:01,170
There's also DNA vaccines, which are there are a lot more side effects really with the RNA vaccines.

314
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:10,020
These vaccines have been pretty safe, given you hear anecdotal reports.

315
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:17,250
But if you give things to millions of people, you're always going to see something in very low frequency.

316
00:45:19,270 --> 00:45:22,810
But aside from the myocarditis, which is real.

317
00:45:26,730 --> 00:45:34,350
I did frequent. These are very safe preparations and people were worried because we knew about the local side effects.

318
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:41,450
Even when they were first, you know, when they were in clinical trials.

319
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:49,790
Now, what are those things that we heard about when the vaccines were first approved?

320
00:45:50,210 --> 00:45:54,170
We don't want to get to these vaccines. They've been rushed. They haven't been tested.

321
00:45:55,490 --> 00:46:02,000
And the steps in vaccine development, which usually take years and years.

322
00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:05,880
We're actually followed,

323
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:17,370
but they were followed instead of working very hard at one step and then going on to the next step and then going into the next step.

324
00:46:18,690 --> 00:46:23,950
They were done in parallel. Why?

325
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:31,280
We need him fast. But why? Why were they willing to do this?

326
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:45,899
Buddy buddy. Because remember, vaccines are produced by pharmaceutical companies that don't want to lose a ton of money.

327
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:52,890
And these are expensive to produce going into clinical trials and paid people to participate, staff and everything else.

328
00:46:53,670 --> 00:47:00,450
The U.S. government. Under under road the vaccine development.

329
00:47:01,410 --> 00:47:11,370
So by the time the vaccines were approved, within weeks they were available with a regular vaccine.

330
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:18,759
That would never have happened. They wouldn't have invested. In filling and finishing and, you know,

331
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:25,180
putting the vaccine in vials and getting it already until they knew they had a sure thing until they were approved.

332
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:39,280
So that you have to give credit to the way the vaccine program was organized for something that had not been done before for flu.

333
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:45,370
You just put in the new variant. Which is in the future.

334
00:47:45,910 --> 00:47:49,710
We all use that word now. And so the vaccine is spreading.

335
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:53,740
It's if you're replacing the strain.

336
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:59,010
So I won't go through these points. You can read them as well.

337
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:10,179
And you know. They even when we heard that it's non-human primates, they were getting such good protection.

338
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:14,200
We didn't. Oh, that said primates. It's not going to bear.

339
00:48:14,950 --> 00:48:24,220
This was came as a very happy surprise that they were as effective at long term intervention development.

340
00:48:24,910 --> 00:48:28,570
Right. If you go back to the building. What happened? No.

341
00:48:29,890 --> 00:48:38,940
Were already there. Already pulling money out. I don't think beyond this year.

342
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:50,639
There's going to be a whole lot of support. And and and and and and we're going to go back to the same old mechanisms of paying for,

343
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:57,300
you know, getting these flu vaccine because of lobbying and the rest to get flu vaccine.

344
00:48:58,140 --> 00:49:08,610
The United States makes recommendations of getting vaccines through the a.S.A.P without knowing how that's going to be paid for.

345
00:49:08,970 --> 00:49:17,850
Other countries do a lot of health economics before they ever think the they approve a vaccine.

346
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:30,180
And we're going to be going back to having insurance and everything else paying for for some of these some of these vaccines,

347
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:35,900
especially in less risky and people who are at lower risk.

348
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:42,620
We know it hasn't evolved yet, but it's going to happen because the government is pulling.

349
00:49:51,870 --> 00:49:57,510
That's okay. And this is it. And this is the setup.

350
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,170
That was carried out and there.

351
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:17,050
Not only was there money. There was an organization behind where they pulled testing subjects from HIV vaccines.

352
00:50:17,230 --> 00:50:24,220
And I. It was an all hands on deck approach to getting these tested.

353
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:34,450
Another worry we had while all this was going on that the clinical trials would take a while to run.

354
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:40,920
And it's surprising to think about it right now.

355
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:48,110
In the summer of 2000, we knew the vaccines were getting ready to be tested.

356
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:54,900
We figured, well, we won't really see that much disease at all.

357
00:50:55,620 --> 00:51:00,420
They won't have cases. The virus proved that's wrong again.

358
00:51:00,510 --> 00:51:05,610
They had plenty of cases because you can't evaluate unless you have cases.

359
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:20,530
And everybody, the Department of Defense and private groups and mainly NIH or commercial research organizations.

360
00:51:20,530 --> 00:51:26,600
You know what? Those are serious. They run all of our clinical trials.

361
00:51:26,830 --> 00:51:33,820
It used to be that universities and scholars and universities ran the clinical trials and all run commercial.

362
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:45,040
We used to. There was a lot of fun running clinical trials.

363
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:57,190
We ran a clinical trial of Tamiflu here of our students during an outbreak wouldn't happen and you'd be one of multiple sites.

364
00:51:58,810 --> 00:52:04,990
The drug companies say it's cheaper because of high indirect costs, but in fact, they control.

365
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:10,720
When you get scientists running trials, they don't control. And so we step.

366
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:21,450
And this was active, which was basically NIH running a lot of the science.

367
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:28,649
And there was one data safety and monitoring board that did all of the vaccines,

368
00:52:28,650 --> 00:52:35,940
including the Novavax vaccine, the AstraZeneca vaccine, everything but the Pfizer vaccine.

369
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:45,680
Pfizer did it all here. They harmonized trials where the trials were done.

370
00:52:45,890 --> 00:52:52,520
It was very clear with case definitions and everything else what you were dealing with.

371
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:57,350
You didn't have any of these. You're having to go back to the drawing board.

372
00:53:01,590 --> 00:53:04,650
And you all know the different companies.

373
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:17,080
The interesting thing was at the very bottom you see Sanofi and GSK and their big boards and somehow they're still not there yet but.

374
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:23,260
Yeah. This is one of the strange things.

375
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:26,510
They're adjuvant. These are adjuvant. They've got adjuvant.

376
00:53:27,210 --> 00:53:34,780
And there's something there is something going on here. And I keep hearing that they're about to come out.

377
00:53:34,780 --> 00:53:40,100
They're testing. And Novavax.

378
00:53:42,850 --> 00:53:46,750
Is has got problems internally.

379
00:53:47,770 --> 00:53:54,280
They haven't been able to get reproducibility of of different lots and things like that,

380
00:53:54,400 --> 00:54:05,350
which are the these are really held to the same kind of standards that are that they are ordinarily.

381
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:18,520
Okay. And safety, as I mentioned, there is real worry because there's some there's evidence of immune activation in animals,

382
00:54:19,390 --> 00:54:23,010
murders, the the camel corona virus.

383
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:27,550
And it didn't show up. Okay.

384
00:54:29,090 --> 00:54:35,210
Two tracks of vaccine approval in the United States Food and Drug Administration.

385
00:54:37,330 --> 00:54:41,170
Approves on the basis of clinical trials and all the rest.

386
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:48,660
And the. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.

387
00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:57,230
Which meets in Atlanta. CDC management usually does the fine tune.

388
00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:01,350
Who should get it? Who do we prioritize?

389
00:55:01,350 --> 00:55:21,800
And the rest? The group that reviews the vaccines in FDA is the vaccines and related biologic products advisory.

390
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:38,860
And for two reasons. The verb pack and FDA have been really driving the entire approval program.

391
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:47,440
It's. And one of them is we'll get into that is with an emergency use authorization.

392
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:58,030
They've got to follow the emergency use authorization when they make the a.S.A.P and CDC makes their recommendations.

393
00:55:58,030 --> 00:56:11,200
And also we, the verb pack, have been making decisions that really belong a.S.A.P because of the situation.

394
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:24,420
And I served on the verb pack from 2016 to 2020.

395
00:56:24,490 --> 00:56:29,280
I made it all in January of 2020.

396
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:36,389
I got a call while I was sitting out on my porch doing some work during the summer of 2020.

397
00:56:36,390 --> 00:56:42,209
Would I come back and be a temporary voting member of the very PAC?

398
00:56:42,210 --> 00:56:50,360
And then a few weeks later I got a call. Dr. Bill Sali, who is the chair, is in conflict.

399
00:56:50,370 --> 00:56:54,850
Would you be the acting chair during the COVID reviews?

400
00:56:54,900 --> 00:57:10,740
And that's how I have been the chair of all of the COVID reviews for my dining room table, not having to go to Washington from the start.

401
00:57:14,310 --> 00:57:20,220
And that's how you you wind up with a student who's gone back to Japan.

402
00:57:20,610 --> 00:57:25,170
Call sending an email. I never thought I'd see you on Japanese television.

403
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:30,070
That was one of the earlier terms. Okay.

404
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:37,650
The verb pack. First meeting. I didn't realize at the time how critical this was.

405
00:57:41,030 --> 00:57:51,650
What we were asked to do is to say that the clinical trial, the way they were organizing the clinical trials and approval were the way things were.

406
00:57:52,490 --> 00:57:56,480
We was it was a good idea. We had. No, no, no, no.

407
00:57:59,510 --> 00:58:01,489
And if you read between the lines,

408
00:58:01,490 --> 00:58:09,740
you knew that in the newspapers there was a tussle going on about what it would take to get vaccines approved and distributed.

409
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:21,140
Because if you remember, another part of FDA had already given emergency use approval to hydroxychloroquine.

410
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:35,240
And the reason is that in the wording for emergency use authorization, there is no requirement for efficacy demonstrated in clinical trials.

411
00:58:35,810 --> 00:58:40,890
If your guess is that, it will probably have a positive effect.

412
00:58:42,430 --> 00:58:46,120
And the risk the benefit is greater than the risk.

413
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:54,979
But we were asked and I'll show you the language and what we were asked to approve that that

414
00:58:54,980 --> 00:59:02,150
it was a good idea to make sure that these vaccines were effective before they were used.

415
00:59:07,220 --> 00:59:20,480
And the reason we were told this is because we're supposed to act independent transparently and independently and not be part of some of this story.

416
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:27,080
And this is why this is this is an FDA slide.

417
00:59:27,090 --> 00:59:36,470
And I saw this afterwards. And it tells you why it would be a bad idea to use an ineffective vaccine.

418
00:59:39,980 --> 00:59:44,860
That was the reason. Because something was going to happen in early November.

419
00:59:44,870 --> 00:59:56,030
And there was. Paradoxically, given the fact that the same people don't in fact, see the push there was to get the vaccine that.

420
01:00:01,130 --> 01:00:12,710
And the approvals were based on showing greater than 50% efficacy against laboratory confirmed infection.

421
01:00:14,870 --> 01:00:22,190
Infection by 50% flu vaccine was 50% effective in a good year.

422
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:30,410
That's why it was set at 50%. And with no lower bound of the confidence interval,

423
01:00:30,770 --> 01:00:38,570
it had to have an effect against severe disease because it was worried it wouldn't show a great deal of effect against severe disease.

424
01:00:39,590 --> 01:00:45,980
And the critical thing. Well, did the usual representative.

425
01:00:46,310 --> 01:00:49,340
And they were because there was a lot of uptake.

426
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:54,570
These vaccines had, as you'll see, tens of thousands of people participate.

427
01:00:54,590 --> 01:01:00,590
These were very large studies, much larger than you need for total confidence intervals.

428
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:05,660
Now, safety. And this was the argument, the worry at first.

429
01:01:11,820 --> 01:01:14,970
And here is three 3000. What's the number?

430
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:18,830
I had 30,000. And.

431
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:31,490
For an emergency use authorization. But it's the.

432
01:01:33,330 --> 01:01:37,600
Okay, this is the key. Two months.

433
01:01:38,020 --> 01:01:44,500
That was the only real shortcut that safety would be.

434
01:01:45,010 --> 01:01:52,030
You needed at least two months of safety data, and the rationale behind this was we needed the vaccines in a hurry.

435
01:01:52,570 --> 01:01:56,650
And most of the vaccine side effects occurred the first six weeks.

436
01:01:57,910 --> 01:02:01,630
So two months mean of two months was considered appropriate.

437
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:07,040
And then there was going to be continued evaluation after.

438
01:02:07,710 --> 01:02:11,830
And that's where we were seeing all of the observational studies.

439
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:17,470
Because the generalizability of what they saw at the clinical trials can't be assured.

440
01:02:19,180 --> 01:02:26,260
Okay. And this was the first meeting on the 10th of December.

441
01:02:27,550 --> 01:02:30,640
And this is what we were showing. These are.

442
01:02:32,590 --> 01:02:40,000
Symptomatic cases. You can see dramatic even before the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine.

443
01:02:41,380 --> 01:02:48,490
The incidence curves have separated and 98% effective.

444
01:02:48,950 --> 01:02:58,660
They didn't have good numbers on severe disease because most of the cases they were looking at were mild.

445
01:03:01,430 --> 01:03:14,060
And this was a voting question. So we had a vote and they said this is the the voting language totality of science based on the stip,

446
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:25,010
on how the regulations are written for emergency use authorization based on totality of scientific vaccine available.

447
01:03:25,460 --> 01:03:29,410
Do the benefits outweigh the risk? And that's the only thing.

448
01:03:29,430 --> 01:03:34,970
That's how they that's how they approved hydroxychloroquine and a number of other things.

449
01:03:37,060 --> 01:03:40,900
Because there wasn't evidence at the time and it looked like, well, they're not there.

450
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:50,500
There are really terrible side effects. Of course, they withdrew the approvals and we had Forbes notes and two abstentions.

451
01:03:50,890 --> 01:03:55,190
And the people voted no or abstained for two reasons.

452
01:03:56,690 --> 01:03:59,090
A couple of them didn't like the treatments.

453
01:04:00,210 --> 01:04:09,460
The other ones didn't like the fact that Pfizer was asking for approval there to age 16, and they were pediatricians and wanted more data in children.

454
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:18,610
And I made the point that there probably are are fewer they had the they had some but not enough.

455
01:04:19,060 --> 01:04:28,000
And I made the point that they probably had more in less than the 18 to 20 year old category than in the 16 and 17 year old,

456
01:04:28,510 --> 01:04:32,500
but felt that that was no not appropriate.

457
01:04:33,910 --> 01:04:40,090
Okay. Week later, Daryn, it comes presents almost identical results.

458
01:04:40,450 --> 01:04:44,940
There's nothing like replication of different preparations.

459
01:04:44,950 --> 01:04:52,450
You take similar but different produced differently to make you feel comfortable that the things are correct.

460
01:04:52,690 --> 01:04:57,490
And they also were able to come up with protection against death.

461
01:05:00,310 --> 01:05:07,870
So we had no noes and only one abstention who was still worried about the two months.

462
01:05:10,620 --> 01:05:15,270
The paradox. Here comes JNJ.

463
01:05:15,390 --> 01:05:20,010
Janssen vaccine, one dose vectored vaccine.

464
01:05:21,030 --> 01:05:27,760
Here is the results. Vaccine effectiveness is in the sixties.

465
01:05:29,650 --> 01:05:37,980
From one dose. And we ask the question, what if you give a second dose?

466
01:05:38,380 --> 01:05:48,030
You said our protocol is one and one and done. We're going to we're going to take over the field for those.

467
01:05:48,130 --> 01:05:59,160
And there was a feeling, first of all, we're above the 50% limit that we said we knew was required for life before approval.

468
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:10,150
And the vaccine has it. We're all beginning to get worried about the vaccine.

469
01:06:11,990 --> 01:06:28,100
So it was approved unanimously. So paradox is you had 90% for the other ones with people voting no and unanimous vote for this because in fact,

470
01:06:29,090 --> 01:06:32,840
several months had gone by and there was a good deal of safety there.

471
01:06:34,430 --> 01:06:40,040
So this is the phase one, as I call it, of the approvals.

472
01:06:42,180 --> 01:06:50,399
22nd of October, setting up the guidelines and the 26th of February approving the JNJ vaccine.

473
01:06:50,400 --> 01:07:03,830
And then. Approvals are different from authorizations emergency use during the summer of 2021.

474
01:07:04,580 --> 01:07:14,629
All of the paperwork and inspections of facilities and the rest were done and FDA approved.

475
01:07:14,630 --> 01:07:18,440
The Pfizer vaccine went ahead and approved the Moderna vaccine.

476
01:07:18,860 --> 01:07:25,099
Unfortunately, we were not called back to review this, which wound up in the newspapers.

477
01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:28,430
Why aren't they going to their committee?

478
01:07:28,660 --> 01:07:33,230
No, they know how to, sweetheart, and it isn't necessary.

479
01:07:34,220 --> 01:07:43,710
And then I call this phase two. We started get going in the pediatric studies and there was a lot of controversy.

480
01:07:43,730 --> 01:07:53,810
Why is it taking so long? Well, the side effects of giving adult dose to children are pretty significant.

481
01:07:54,710 --> 01:08:02,510
And in fact, what finally came out of this to go to cut to the end of the story was the

482
01:08:02,510 --> 01:08:08,570
Pfizer vaccine for very young children under two years of age is probably two.

483
01:08:11,070 --> 01:08:17,150
Too weak. That's why you only get three doses instead of two to get the Moderna.

484
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:22,200
They were worried about side effects and moderna's approved for two and it's more confusion.

485
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:29,520
There's a lot of confusion out there in terms of all the preparations, the different doses and everything else.

486
01:08:31,940 --> 01:08:37,760
But what was clear here is that there was waning of immunity.

487
01:08:39,530 --> 01:08:42,740
We already had the delta strains.

488
01:08:44,030 --> 01:08:47,960
We were through Alpha Beta and Gamma Delta by this time.

489
01:08:49,100 --> 01:08:56,180
And you needed boosters because of waning and decrease in immune response.

490
01:08:58,450 --> 01:09:05,830
So the 17th and the 14th, the 15th were boosters, you know, on the 26th of October.

491
01:09:06,460 --> 01:09:14,470
The first record proved first the Pfizer for a third of the those who children.

492
01:09:15,140 --> 01:09:24,160
And somebody who's a member of the committee wrote in an op ed in The Wall Street Journal yesterday or

493
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:33,880
the day before saying it's too bad they have lower doses and the boosters bet against the boosters.

494
01:09:34,370 --> 01:09:40,189
And the reason is that you don't really need as much for a secondary response.

495
01:09:40,190 --> 01:09:44,980
So also the maddern it was probably too high or 200 micrograms.

496
01:09:48,350 --> 01:10:04,160
Okay. And this is more of, again, how the media reports Pfizer asked for the boosters down to age the first time down to age 16,

497
01:10:05,090 --> 01:10:13,100
and there was pushback from the committee. Because of two things.

498
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:22,040
We were beginning to see the myocarditis. We really didn't know what was going on in my heart with myocarditis.

499
01:10:22,040 --> 01:10:33,710
It turns out that with the booster you get lower frequency of myocarditis than you do with the second dose, which is the peak dose for myocarditis.

500
01:10:34,220 --> 01:10:40,130
That may be because those who would have got by.

501
01:10:40,580 --> 01:10:50,270
And the question is. Or people who are more likely to get by are there dated for whatever reason that we don't understand pulling out?

502
01:10:50,270 --> 01:10:53,660
Is that the reason or is an immunologic reason we don't know.

503
01:10:54,890 --> 01:11:08,360
So the media got very exercised about the fact we voted no about the original request, but we also voted.

504
01:11:10,250 --> 01:11:19,700
We also voted unanimously approving a limited approval for older people, those who were in risky conditions.

505
01:11:21,940 --> 01:11:32,320
And this is a whole nother lecture. And if you don't know about variants of interest, variants of concern,

506
01:11:32,950 --> 01:11:41,140
variants of concern, the ones we are talking about are all in the high concern category.

507
01:11:44,870 --> 01:11:48,110
And how many of you remember Pete, too?

508
01:11:50,030 --> 01:11:56,690
Do you remember Pete, too? Everybody was so worried about Pete to which was the one that was in Brazil.

509
01:11:57,680 --> 01:12:03,110
Which is? Yeah. Everybody was so concerned it's going to take over.

510
01:12:03,110 --> 01:12:07,100
It was significantly different from it had enjoyed the extent.

511
01:12:09,910 --> 01:12:15,640
Then the parents who had it never spread.

512
01:12:17,740 --> 01:12:20,800
The proof of the pudding is when these variants start spreading.

513
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:29,550
They're always with everybody now sequencing to find variants of interest.

514
01:12:31,940 --> 01:12:36,890
But you're not going to know what's a variant of concern until you begin to see it spreading.

515
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:52,110
Not even in a single country. And there is phase three of our approvals.

516
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:59,070
Key thing is the Novavax vaccine finally got emergency use authorization.

517
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:08,640
And we went down to six months of age.

518
01:13:11,670 --> 01:13:22,570
Knowing that we the key was we're not going to mandate we got deluged with letters from Robert Kennedy is anti-vaccine.

519
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:35,070
I had to turn off the phone my my phone fraud and I had to put a filter on my emails because we were getting tremendous.

520
01:13:36,510 --> 01:13:42,840
Same message for me. I think that's the way he gets his his support.

521
01:13:43,860 --> 01:13:51,480
Got it. And we never intended this to be for anybody who didn't want to get their children vaccinated.

522
01:13:54,930 --> 01:14:01,770
And on the 28th of June, we made the recommendation,

523
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:13,680
which was that the boat was an American variant should be included in the vaccine and in the discussion with our vote,

524
01:14:14,820 --> 01:14:20,490
the sense was it should be bivalent, including the original strain.

525
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:32,610
Because we had the best information on that and that it should be the 8.4 and five

526
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:40,560
because that's the one that's circulating or descendants of it are currently circulating.

527
01:14:40,710 --> 01:14:48,980
And it was significantly different and looked more immunogenic than the one W.H.O. recommended.

528
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:57,620
Be a one. They really. So they had their meetings several months before ours.

529
01:14:58,250 --> 01:15:01,970
So right now and there's very little recognition of that.

530
01:15:02,550 --> 01:15:09,290
U.S. is just about the only country that's giving B eight, four or five.

531
01:15:09,410 --> 01:15:18,620
The rest of the world is giving ba1 as they bought as the Omaha Con variant in the vaccine.

532
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:25,660
Everybody is giving it by their vaccine. So that's where we are right now.

533
01:15:32,460 --> 01:15:37,630
What to watch for. You don't know.

534
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:46,690
There's a lot of noise about the fact that Bay four or five was not tested much in humans.

535
01:15:47,950 --> 01:15:56,230
It's now being treated like a strain. Update for flu because those strains are not tested.

536
01:15:56,500 --> 01:16:05,380
The assumption is they're going to function just like the ones that are that they resemble so closely, except for indigenous.

537
01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:14,340
Mix and match. These studies are hard to do.

538
01:16:15,750 --> 01:16:27,420
You probably get better immunity if you get a vectored vaccine or a, you know, a protein vaccine.

539
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:37,050
In addition, we know that infection plus plus immune vaccination gives you the best immunity.

540
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:45,810
And that's something we don't know about yet. More analysis for vaccine is not approved in the US.

541
01:16:46,170 --> 01:16:58,080
I mentioned that antivirals and their therapy we need and we should forget flu and pandemic planning.

542
01:17:01,300 --> 01:17:02,830
But the key thing I want to.

543
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:17,070
Ask you is what happens when the emergency declared by the Health and human secretary is Secretary of Health and Human Services.

544
01:17:19,350 --> 01:17:29,290
And. What happens to our reconstruction here?

545
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:40,320
If everything is emergency use, three quarters of what we're doing for emergency use,

546
01:17:41,340 --> 01:17:50,700
if an emergency ends is they had the authorizations and people forget that they're they're going to have to figure that out.

547
01:17:50,700 --> 01:17:55,590
And the emergency will not be ended before they figure that out.

548
01:18:00,310 --> 01:18:04,240
About all of the boosters that are emergency use authorization.

549
01:18:04,240 --> 01:18:14,740
It has been a mechanism which has been very useful for FDA because they don't want they live by precedent

550
01:18:16,060 --> 01:18:23,860
and they don't want to change the precedent for what it takes to fully license a vaccine or a therapeutic.

551
01:18:27,020 --> 01:18:30,710
But on the other hand, we are where we are.
