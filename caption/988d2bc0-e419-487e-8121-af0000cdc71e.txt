1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:14,110
It's less attractive. I'm not sure, Brad, but it's like, I would love to hear what the ACA is like so much more so as like everybody else.

2
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:18,640
I thought that was the point I was making.

3
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:34,240
But you do it. Me. But not because it's not, I guess.

4
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:46,960
So it's like it's just to just, you know, just know about the other things that I'm concerned.

5
00:00:47,550 --> 00:01:00,090
And I think, yeah, I could find this out like last night.

6
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:05,040
Yeah, it was kind of super inspiring.

7
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:19,139
And then I just like, I don't know, it makes us all more Christian, I suppose, I guess that sort of thing.

8
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:37,650
So I started till about six months or so last year when I am from Las Vegas.

9
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:43,660
And that's really yeah.

10
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:53,340
But you know where she would be shifting gears a little bit from sort of a pure micro theory that we're focused on.

11
00:01:53,340 --> 00:02:03,420
So now it's more of the health care applications, the sort of some introductory stuff on theory of policy and the dynamics of health care.

12
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:16,750
And there's not a lot of demand for health care. They have three big economic questions about the delivery of health care.

13
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:23,520
And we got framed those as sort of output, production and distribution output.

14
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:28,000
How much should we spend on medical services the bigger the service at a societal level?

15
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:35,709
And then what should the composition of those services be? It's not just about how much resources we devote to health care, but how should we?

16
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:37,060
We should have centered,

17
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:46,360
specialty oriented system in glass house or a more primary care oriented system in some other countries out in the bloodstream.

18
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:51,729
Once we've decided what we're going to produce, how much health care and what types of health care, how should we do it?

19
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:57,010
What's the best way of producing those policies? So if we want, say, a primary care heavy system,

20
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:03,639
should we rely more heavily on primary care physicians or rely relatively more heavily on the advanced

21
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:11,950
practice nurses and physician assistants with a smaller role for M.D.s in the final question of distribution.

22
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:13,780
So we have these services.

23
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:22,450
How are we going to determine who gets stuff and how people the science and we can't break up these issues into sort of efficiency versus equity.

24
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,780
First two are really primarily efficiency issues.

25
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:32,950
Are we producing the right amounts of the right things and are reproducing them at the lowest possible opportunity cost?

26
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:40,570
Are we being efficient in what we're doing and doing the right stuff and are reproducing it in the most efficient possible way?

27
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:46,170
The third issue distribution across the population is really primarily an equity issue.

28
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,719
And there we have to seriously answer questions such as should consumers decide how

29
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:56,940
much care they get or should that be somehow limited or constrained by the system?

30
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:02,910
Should society subsidize services for consumers with low with low incomes?

31
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:09,570
So those are primarily equity issues that are more designed to be solved, kind of at the root at the political level.

32
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:20,340
So that's what I call the fundamental trilemma of health care policy cost, quality and access again, to.

33
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:26,320
So we have three primary goals of health policy. We'd like to have ideally low cost.

34
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:30,970
We like to have high quality. And we like to have broad access to care.

35
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,670
And you can kind of imagine that there are going to be some inevitable trade offs.

36
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,070
Trying to achieve all three of these goals simultaneously is often going to be difficult.

37
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,910
So, for example, if we want quality and access, we want to enhance those things.

38
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,830
We're probably going to have to spend more money in order to accomplish that.

39
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:59,140
So it's going to be fundamentally difficult to attain all three goals without having at least some level of tradeoff and saying,

40
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,460
well, if we want to control costs at some level, we have to constrain quality or access.

41
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:10,570
If we want to maximize quality and access, we're probably going to have to devote more resources to the system.

42
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:19,380
And so we talked about the first day sort of what is economics, what's the single word we use to describe why we study economics?

43
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:28,140
Scarcity. Scarcity, right, that are once as individuals and as societies exceed our available resources.

44
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:34,890
And scarcity forces us into tradeoffs. If it weren't for scarcity, we wouldn't have to make tradeoffs.

45
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:46,770
Oftentimes, though, health policy discussions seem to ignore those trade offs or even potentially deny that those trade offs exist.

46
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,680
I'll give a few examples of that. I'm one of those, as you often hear.

47
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,070
Well, prevention saves money while improving outcomes.

48
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,860
That's something you hear by advocates of prevention. Sometimes if we just did more prevention,

49
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:10,350
we'd have better health and we'd spend less money because discovering and treating something earlier is cheaper than waiting for it to.

50
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:19,860
Manifestly it's the argument that you've heard that isn't true.

51
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:25,590
At times I think I'll argue with the slight. At times it's true.

52
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:30,139
But on average it's probably not true. And it may well be okay that it's not true.

53
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:33,650
On average, that wouldn't necessarily mean that prevention is a bad thing.

54
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:43,860
The question is, is it worth the cost? So think about a preventive intervention, say cancer screening.

55
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:47,910
Suppose I'm a very lucky person. I go through the screening program.

56
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:57,510
I'm identified with an early stage cancer, and it is treated fairly easily and fairly successfully because it was discovered early.

57
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:01,350
So in my individual case, absolutely true.

58
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:10,200
And I not gone to a screening program, I would have had a worse clinical outcome and a higher cost of treatment.

59
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:17,760
But does that mean screening saves money? This isn't just about me.

60
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:25,979
So we had to first screen the entire population to discover the few people like me that had the cancer

61
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:30,120
caught early because of the screening test and would have been caught later and had not been screened.

62
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:36,120
So the savings on my care then have to be big enough to offset this big screening program.

63
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:44,070
So maybe the screen test is cheap per person, but we're doing it on hundreds of thousands or millions of people trying to find it.

64
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:48,660
And full of early cancers, are there are screening tests perfect.

65
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:54,700
Perfectly accurate. And so what are you worried about?

66
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:57,940
Is the screening test. False positives. Right.

67
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:03,280
And so the screen test is going to determine some positive results if there's an abnormality.

68
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:09,530
The morality doesn't mean I have cancer. It just means the screening test has flagged something.

69
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:13,520
If the screening tests were perfect, yeah, then the abnormality would mean I have cancer.

70
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:21,260
But it's not. There are false positives. So we're going to screen millions of people and get a whole bunch of positive tests.

71
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:26,959
Probably a lot of those are false positives. Are we just going to tell everybody that a positive test?

72
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:32,060
Will you go home? We're going to do follow up imaging tests.

73
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:39,230
We're going to biopsies. We're do all kinds of other costly things to sort out the false positives from the true positives like me.

74
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:45,640
So at the end of the day, for us, for the screening program to save money,

75
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:53,080
we have to have enough people identified early enough with enough savings to offset all

76
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:58,150
the costs of the screening and all the costs of investigating the false positives.

77
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:03,190
All of a sudden, it's not so obvious that screening is going to save money.

78
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:10,480
It did in my individual case, but we can't know who I am until we've done the screening on millions of people.

79
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:15,100
So the program as a whole is very unlikely to save money.

80
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:21,489
There there's a literature review done by the National Journal of Medicine that looked

81
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:26,469
at both screening are both preventive interventions and treatment interventions.

82
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:36,190
Things are interventions that treat an already discovered and existing disease and looked at cost effectiveness and some were cost saving.

83
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:43,060
The orange is preventive measures and the yellow is treatment for existing conditions,

84
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:50,260
and about 20% of preventive measures were found to be cost saving in this literature review.

85
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:55,870
It's about one in five. So it is possible that some preventive measures save money.

86
00:09:56,230 --> 00:10:02,440
It turned out, though, almost the same percentage of treatment measures were found to be cost saving.

87
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:07,180
We find a newer way of doing something that's better and cheaper.

88
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:14,379
So prevention sometimes saved money, but it actually wasn't that special treatment.

89
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,730
Also sometimes save money.

90
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:25,840
And almost identical about one percentage point lower down some things, although they're not cost saving, are still incredibly cost effective.

91
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:31,930
There's a metric called quality adjusted life year that's used in a lot of the cost effectiveness literature.

92
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:42,310
And basically it's just a way of trying to compare different interventions that affect different outcomes by some some interventions at life years.

93
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:46,889
Other interventions improve quality of life, but they may not necessarily have life years.

94
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:50,080
Some interventions might do both. It might improve quality and quantity of life.

95
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:55,720
So we try to look at interventions for different types of conditions, different types of interventions,

96
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:59,710
and kind of come up with a common metric that's called a quality adjusted life year.

97
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:04,240
So they don't think of it so conceptually this way.

98
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:13,900
Imagine that you had a year you spent a year in perfect health that would be considered a 1 to 1 quality adjusted life year.

99
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:18,970
And imagine you died the other anchor that would be a zero.

100
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:22,540
And then in between is living at less than perfect health.

101
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:26,860
So there's a some rating scale methods that have been developed.

102
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:32,410
And let's say we describe a certain set of symptoms or you have a certain set of symptoms or a certain condition.

103
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:37,150
And we ask people sort of, well, how do you feel about your quality of life?

104
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:41,500
Anchoring it at one is perfect health and zero is death.

105
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:46,360
You know, where is your current state of health concerns? You know, about 1.9.

106
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:50,650
You know, I've got some bad arthritis. I can't get around as much as I used to.

107
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:57,309
I can't do some of the activities that I enjoy doing. But, you know, I still have my family.

108
00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:05,260
I still have other things I can do about 0.9. So a year in that state of health, we get point nine quality adjusted life years.

109
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:11,980
So it's a way of just taking very different clinical outcomes and sort of putting them on common metrics that we can compare,

110
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:18,970
say the cost effectiveness of an intervention for cardiac disease through your benefit for arthritis.

111
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:26,530
And there's a bunch of studies done, about 12% of the preventive ones,

112
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:31,420
about 16% of the treatment that although they are not cost saving, they add cost,

113
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:34,270
but they improve quality so much, improve outcomes so much,

114
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:39,790
they're incredibly cost effective, less than $10,000 per quality adjusted life year gained.

115
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:47,530
So nobody would argue that those interventions, though not cost saving, are still a great value for money.

116
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,530
And then there's a whole bunch more.

117
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:59,920
They're also pretty clearly cost effective by the normal standards used in American medicine less than $50,000 for quality of life here and there.

118
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:06,700
You've got about 35% of the preventive interventions, about 34% of the treatment interventions.

119
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:13,850
So all of these. They're clearly cost effective, even though they're not cost saving.

120
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:20,299
So as we still ought to do that and now we're going a little bit less cost effective.

121
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:28,520
But most people would argue that 50 to $100000 for quality adjusted life year is still the United States today, a reasonable buy.

122
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:36,180
And some would argue that even up to $250,000 per quality adjusted life year is a reasonable risk of resources.

123
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:43,820
And then we kind of get out here. We've got some that are between a quarter million and $1,000,000, some are over $1,000,000.

124
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:49,610
And then these are the terrible ones. They have worse outcomes and higher cost.

125
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:54,320
So there's technical economic term you can use for these.

126
00:13:54,950 --> 00:14:03,350
And these are called no brainers because obviously do this, it's better outcomes in lower cost.

127
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:10,730
What's not to like? You obviously don't do these if it's worse outcomes and higher cost wants to like nothing.

128
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:16,610
And then where do you draw the line in here? So let's say we draw it in $250,000.

129
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:23,600
So there's a whole bunch of interventions, both preventive and treatment, that we shouldn't do.

130
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:30,950
They're either a waste of resources. They're either not not a good use of resources or an outright waste of resources.

131
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,500
So let's eliminate all of these out here.

132
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:44,600
At the number in here, the arguably cost effective, cost effective range is a lot higher than the number in the cost saving range.

133
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:53,190
I'm advocating for prevention. And I say the reason we should do prevention is it's going to save us money.

134
00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:01,510
Right. They are eight times out of ten. I'm wrong. So as soon as you show me that I'm wrong.

135
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:06,430
Well, that's the argument that I made. And you've just blown my strongest argument out of the water.

136
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:14,950
What I should have said is that why would we hold prevention and treatment to different standards?

137
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:20,500
Do we demand surgeons prove their interventions are cost saving before we let them do surgery?

138
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:27,770
Do we demand pharmaceutical and biotech companies? Price products.

139
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:31,030
So their cost saving. Otherwise we won't let the FDA approve them.

140
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:42,840
No, we don't hold any of the treatment. Interventions to a standard that, well, you have to be cost saving to prove that you're worthwhile.

141
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:51,040
Why would we hold prevention to that standard? Obviously, if it's in the no radar category, we want to do it if it is cost saving, and some are.

142
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:55,439
But again, prevention is not really unique to very similar amount of treatment.

143
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:05,280
Interventions were also cost saving. But if it's in this area where it's cost effective, you shouldn't say, well, prevention doesn't save money.

144
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,889
It's these interventions are cost increasing.

145
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:15,540
Therefore we shouldn't do them unless we're also going to say, well, treatment is not cost saving, it increases costs, therefore we shouldn't do it.

146
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,860
We're never going to say that about treatment. So why should we say it about prevention?

147
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:32,809
So we did have some rough. Com blanket claims that prevention is going to save money is kind of pretending the trade offs don't exist once in a while.

148
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:36,470
It's right about one time out of five, but on average it's wrong.

149
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:43,969
But that doesn't mean we shouldn't do it. The question should be, is it a worthwhile use of resources if it doesn't save money?

150
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:50,510
If it does save money, improve outcomes, then it's in the no brainer group. But if not, if it's here, that's a great buy.

151
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:59,450
Prevention doesn't save money for these interventions, but is incredibly cost effective and there's no sane reason not to do it.

152
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:05,810
So that's kind of one example of an area where the public discourse sometimes

153
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:11,870
ignores the existence of trade offs or even explicitly denies the trade offs.

154
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:23,490
Are there? There's another one. Isn't it great that the University of Michigan buys me health insurance?

155
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,370
It's so awesome that I get my health insurance and they give it to me.

156
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:33,360
They love me so much that they give me this great health insurance plan with Blue Cross Blue Shield.

157
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:42,680
What's wrong with that argument? My kind of naive salary may be lost as a result.

158
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:46,480
Isn't that right? So basically, who's really paying for that?

159
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:57,730
I'd argue that really, I'm paying for it. Does the University of Michigan care about how much my health insurance costs, how much my salary costs,

160
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:06,250
or how much the combined package of salary and benefits that they're paying to avoid, even if they should care about the whole thing.

161
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:12,490
They said, Well. If I want earth to work us afford for us this year, we're going to pay him this much salary.

162
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:18,280
We're going to offer this much health benefit, this much retirement benefit, etc., etc.

163
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:22,720
What does that whole bundle cost and is it worth it?

164
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:30,090
Is he generating enough value to us to make it worth that entire compensation bundle?

165
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:33,420
If not, we should fire him. Fortunately, I have tenure, so they can't do that.

166
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,620
So I no longer need to provide value to.

167
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:47,840
If I ever want to get a raise again, I still need to provide value, but at least they can explicitly fire or very quickly.

168
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:54,380
So I think they ought to be saying, well, what's the whole cost of employing them?

169
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:57,710
Not how much does its health insurance cost? How much is it salary?

170
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:03,050
Do they care of my health insurance costs of thousand dollars more, but they pay me $1,000 less in salary.

171
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:07,490
It's all the same to them. And am I worth it?

172
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:12,600
So benefits are offered to recruit and retain your workforce.

173
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:20,070
So since I'm somebody who values health insurance, if they didn't offer me health insurance or they offer me only really cheap,

174
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:25,110
crappy health insurance policy, I would start looking for another job,

175
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:32,320
especially if they didn't raise my salary, if they gave me a cheap, crappy health insurance policy,

176
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:38,340
and then they raised my salary enough that I could then pay for a better health insurance policy on my own.

177
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:46,889
Well, okay. You want to do it that way? I do it that way because it is giving me a good health insurance policy, a lower salary to start with.

178
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:51,210
But as long as you're compensating me with a higher salary, you know, I can make do.

179
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:56,360
But if you're going to try and say, well, your health insurance is getting more expensive every year,

180
00:19:56,370 --> 00:20:01,620
so we're going to cut your health insurance cost and we're also going to cut your salary, by the way.

181
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:07,170
And we're in cover of your retirement contribution. All of a sudden, I'm looking for another job.

182
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:15,720
So the purpose of benefits is to help the employer recruit and retain labor and their incentives to offer the mix of cash and benefits.

183
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:19,890
That is the most efficient way of doing that.

184
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:25,380
So if they're trying to attract a workforce that primarily are people that place a high value on health insurance,

185
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:29,879
they're going to be more successful if they don't put in the salary quite as high,

186
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:37,710
but they offer really good health benefits if another employer is trying to attract a workforce that maybe doesn't care as much about health benefits.

187
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:42,690
Let's say they're trying to attract a lot of people who are under 26 and who can stay on their parents plan.

188
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:50,760
They're probably not going to do as well if they say, you know, we're offering you this kind of crappy salary, but we have awesome health benefits.

189
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:59,430
If I can stay mom and Dad's plan for three more years, a crappy salary and awesome health benefits is not going to attract me.

190
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:06,690
And if I'm already working there, it's not going to retain me. I'm going to look for the place skimpier on health benefits and offers a better salary.

191
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,620
So essentially, I'm paying for my own health insurance.

192
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:15,629
I'm paying for it because I have a lower salary than I would have if they didn't offer me health benefits

193
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:19,590
may have a lower retirement contribution than I would have if they didn't offer me health benefits.

194
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:28,020
So we look at the flow of funds. Who writes the check? That isn't really who pays for it.

195
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:33,420
University of Michigan is the conduit to write the check for my health insurance.

196
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:40,979
But as part of my compensation for working here, if they didn't give me health insurance, they'd have to give me something else.

197
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:47,790
Otherwise I'd start looking elsewhere. I spent less than the employer paid.

198
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:53,820
Partially, though, like, you know, there is their contribution towards what you paid for.

199
00:21:56,990 --> 00:22:00,730
Right. But they write the check. They write the check to the insurance company.

200
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:08,450
But really, I'm paying for it because if they didn't give me health insurance, they would have to raise my salary or I would leave.

201
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:19,160
So it's this idea of kind of called shared responsibility that employers,

202
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:26,450
the government and individuals have a shared responsibility for funding health insurance.

203
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:32,630
It's a very popular notion. It sounds really good.

204
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:36,530
Everybody does their part. Employers do their part.

205
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:43,460
Individuals or I pay part of my premium. I'm not getting 100% of the premium for my pay by the University of Michigan.

206
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:50,840
And the government does it in part by funding either people who can't afford insurance or even in the employer market.

207
00:22:51,440 --> 00:23:05,210
The government funds me out of the funding. Let's be honest kind of had health insurance through our job is a pretax or post-tax pretax.

208
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:10,880
So in other words, if the University of Michigan pays, it pays me a dollar in cash.

209
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:18,319
I get taxes deducted from that. If they pay me a dollar and health insurance, I don't have to report that as taxable income.

210
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,470
And they don't withhold any tax from it. They don't have to pay either.

211
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:26,030
Yeah. That that would help. Right.

212
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:32,360
So basically. There's a certain, it seems like shared responsibility.

213
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:39,680
University, Spain, part of my premium. The government is allowing the university and me to pay it out of pretax rather than post-tax dollars.

214
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:44,390
So it's a direct subsidy to my insurance and I'm paying part of the premium.

215
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:47,660
So in terms of a flow of funds. That's exactly right.

216
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:56,620
All three parties contribute over like a cent employer sponsored health insurance as part of my compensation.

217
00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:03,100
And some other part of my compensation is lower than it would be in a world where the university didn't offer health insurance.

218
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,180
If you haven't decided we're getting out of the health insurance business.

219
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:11,620
There's these perfectly good exchanges that you can go buy an individual policy on.

220
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:18,460
You think they just keep paying everybody the same salary they paid last year?

221
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:24,959
No way. So the fact that my salary would have to go up means that my salary currently

222
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,610
is lower than it otherwise would be because I'm getting health insurance.

223
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:33,060
So I'm paying for my own health insurance regardless of what happens.

224
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:38,580
Also, look at the government. What is the government?

225
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:44,820
Isn't that us? What's the government's source of funds?

226
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:48,810
Taxes. So what are the trade offs there?

227
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:57,090
So if the government decides, well, we're going to expand the Medicaid program or we're going to let people join Medicare at age 60 instead of 65,

228
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:04,290
or we're going to expand the exchanges and end the subsidies for the health insurance exchanges.

229
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:11,250
Well, government has three possible ways of funding that. Number one, raise taxes on current taxpayers.

230
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:17,489
Number two, borrow at least from the federal government.

231
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:21,389
State governments have to run a balanced budget, so it's harder for them to borrow.

232
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:32,280
But it's federal they can borrow, i.e. raise taxes on future taxpayers as in the future markets or three, they can cut other government spending.

233
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:39,270
And so state budgets and most state budgets under its state constitutions have to be balanced.

234
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:44,320
So they don't have the federal government's ability to say, you know, we're going to spend, you know,

235
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:50,340
$1,000,000,000,000 more than we're taking in in taxes this year, and we're going to issue bonds effectively borrowing.

236
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:56,010
We're paying the interest on that. That was paying the interest on those bonds of current taxpayers.

237
00:25:57,570 --> 00:25:59,730
State governments generally have to balance their budgets.

238
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:08,370
So if, say, the Medicaid program becomes much more expensive, they're going to have really just two choices raise taxes on current taxpayers.

239
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:14,510
They can't really raise them on fewer future taxpayers by borrowing or cut some other programs.

240
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:24,800
So as Medicaid became more expensive over the decades, and the evidence is that the biggest thing that states did is cut higher ed.

241
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:28,240
So as mentioned,

242
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:36,380
if you look at a lot of states and you look at the data and you also look at the policy debates that were occurring as Medicaid became more expensive.

243
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:44,360
One of the main targets was, well, we're not going to raise taxes, or at least I can't raise taxes enough to pay for the additional Medicaid costs.

244
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:48,890
So we're going to do a lot of other things. And the big thing that got cut was higher education.

245
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:55,160
So then tuitions went up for state schools because our support went down.

246
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:59,660
So who paid for it? Against the citizens.

247
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:06,850
So there's not like this mythical entity called the government out there that doles out resources that don't cost anybody anything,

248
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:12,760
either taxes today or we pay interest today and they taxes in the future,

249
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:17,080
or they cut some other valuable program that we that we as a society would like to have.

250
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:29,580
And the third one are you often. Of your discussion as if there are trade offs.

251
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:35,700
And I'm not trying to argue for or against Medicare for all make a point about trade off the ball.

252
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:43,920
You often hear, well, Medicare for all is just a win, win win because we got all these administrative costs and high prices in health care.

253
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:48,720
So we're going to pay everybody, Medicare rates, all hospitals and doctors and get Medicare rates.

254
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:52,710
And we're going to eliminate all this administrative cost.

255
00:27:54,700 --> 00:28:00,189
We save all this money and at the same time, we're going to eliminate all patient cost sharing.

256
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:05,950
No deductibles, no co-pays. We're going to add dental coverage and vision coverage and all types of other things

257
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:11,139
that aren't currently covered in federal programs and in the existing Medicare program.

258
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:16,360
For the elderly disabled, those things are not covered. So we're going to have all this coverage.

259
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:20,350
We're going to eliminate cost sharing to patients at the point of service.

260
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:25,750
And we're still going to save money while we're expanding access to everybody

261
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:29,200
else was harder to refute because obviously we haven't run the experiment.

262
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:35,800
But there there's some assumptions there that at least ought to give us some pause.

263
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:48,360
Think about the ACA. It's a kind of a weird bill, some provisions in it and say, how did that happen?

264
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:53,110
Does that make any sense? But what?

265
00:28:54,790 --> 00:29:02,130
And so. Think about that, the elimination of the cost sharing subsidies.

266
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:09,630
So we saw those data a few weeks ago that people between 200 and 300% of the federal poverty line really are not very well protected.

267
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:19,390
So that's one thing. Other things like there were various things built in kickbacks for certain senators to get their vote.

268
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:28,510
So we had probably the best bill that could have been passed and the historic opportunity to pass something.

269
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:35,290
And then ten years later, we haven't really been able to amend it to take care of any of the problems that have been discovered,

270
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:39,310
because politically the environment has not allowed us to improve it.

271
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:47,940
Like a party. Prescription drug coverage. And so Medicare was instituted in 1965.

272
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:54,170
At that point, they wanted a prescription drug coverage that they had in mind.

273
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:58,470
Well, there's a certain amount of money. There's a maximum budget that we know and get the votes for.

274
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:02,280
And we have to cut some things out. So they cut prescription drugs.

275
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:07,570
Same thing with the ACA. There was sort of maximum budgets or $1 trillion over ten years was kind of, you know,

276
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:12,600
what they were looking at for a budget number numbers when any higher they would have lost a couple of votes and they would pass nothing.

277
00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:19,020
So everything else had to be fit in to say, well, if this costs a dollar, we have to take out another dollar somewhere else.

278
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:27,030
And so prescription drug coverage is not in Medicare in 1965, partly due to a budget compromise.

279
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:34,620
I wasn't that big of a deal in 1965 because there weren't a lot of really,

280
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:39,750
really expensive medications and biotech products that people took chronically.

281
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:46,770
A lot of that really expensive stuff, especially expensive stuff that you stay on for years, has been invented since then.

282
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:54,630
So probably the financial risk associated with pharmaceutical spending in 1965 was not super high.

283
00:30:55,110 --> 00:31:01,170
So if there's something you had to drop from insurance in order to meet a budget number, it was probably a reasonable choice.

284
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:05,969
But then more expensive drugs started developing.

285
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:15,720
And certainly by the 1970s and 1980s, every employer sponsored plan except the very, very, very worst plans and prescription drug coverage.

286
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:21,060
Medicare patients, the ones using the most prescription drugs,

287
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:24,750
still didn't have prescription drug coverage because there wasn't a political opportunity to pass it.

288
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:39,729
It did get passed in 1988. They may know that the history of that bill catastrophic care act 1988 some if you've

289
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:46,040
heard of in 600 pieces talked about it so that's what the CARE Act was passed the

290
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:50,980
prescription drug coverage and to limit out-of-pocket costs for Medicare recipients

291
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:55,900
which Medicare recipients and their lobbying groups have been pushing for for years,

292
00:31:56,470 --> 00:32:05,570
finally got passed. However. It also raised premiums to Medicare patients to pay for those benefits.

293
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:10,530
Once they realized that the things we were lobbying for, we're going to have to pay for.

294
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:19,180
They literally rioted at Google, Dan Rostenkowski.

295
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:25,000
He was the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee of the committee that is sort of in charge as legislation.

296
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:31,329
He basically got attacked at a public event by a bunch of Medicare recipients with signs

297
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:34,930
that surrounded his car and wouldn't let him leave and were yelling and screaming at him.

298
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:41,720
And a year later, it was. So it never actually went into effect.

299
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:55,549
Okay. So now it's 23. We get the Medicare Modernization Act under George W Bush that covers Part D meant that incidents the Part

300
00:32:55,550 --> 00:33:02,960
D prescription drug plan now is a prescription drug plan or part D is it just like standard Medicare?

301
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:08,000
It is part of the Medicare benefit. That was it run.

302
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:18,839
So it had to be run through private insurers because the pharmaceutical lobby said,

303
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:23,360
no way are we going to let this pass if it just becomes a medicare benefit,

304
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:26,879
because we know that Medicare is going to have this massive pricing power that they're

305
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:31,590
going to hold over us in the future because the larger share of our market is.

306
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:43,970
People over 65. So we're only going to let this pass if it's a voluntary benefit run by competing private insurers.

307
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:48,139
We, the drug companies, think none of which is going to have a big enough market share to have anywhere

308
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:51,770
near the clout that Medicare would if this just became a medicare benefit.

309
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:55,310
So Medicare sets the prices for hospitalizations.

310
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:57,920
They set the prices for physicians under the program.

311
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:03,820
The drug companies say there is no way and we have immense lobbying power, got a lot of money we can throw around to Congress.

312
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:07,910
This will never pass if it just becomes a part of Medicare.

313
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:13,730
It's got to be run in this very different way than create a bunch of other problems.

314
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:18,410
Okay. So it's voluntary. Who's going to enroll?

315
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:24,400
But the case where people can afford it and people who think there is a lot of drugs.

316
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:29,980
Now, it turns out prescription meds, prescription meds are the most predictable thing in health care.

317
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:36,850
I really don't know if I'm really hospitalized this year. That's sort of very random and unpredictable.

318
00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:42,250
But if I know what drugs I was taking last year and how much they cost,

319
00:34:42,970 --> 00:34:47,530
I can pretty accurately forecast what drugs I'm going to be taking this year and how much they're going to cost.

320
00:34:48,430 --> 00:34:52,059
So in other words, if you're asking me to pay a premium to voluntarily join this plan,

321
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:56,050
I can easily figure out is it worth my while to join that plan or not?

322
00:34:57,630 --> 00:35:04,000
If it turns out I get some expensive new prescription this year, I wasn't anticipating I'll pay for it for a few months and then I'll join next year.

323
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:10,180
So I've got an incentive to game the system. Now I don't use a lot of drugs and why would I pay $1,000 a year?

324
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:13,900
And I only have one. Generic medicine costs $5 a month.

325
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:20,019
So I said, Well, we know what's going to happen in a voluntary system.

326
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:22,810
So now we've got to build these weird ways to get people to join,

327
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:30,550
to get the cheap people to join so that the premiums are too high for the people who have a lot of expensive drugs.

328
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:36,489
So the two things. One was the donut hole, which is sort of a bizarre insurance structure.

329
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:37,240
So basically say, well,

330
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:44,320
we want to make sure that people who don't use a lot of drugs at least see some value in sort of pretty good coverage from the first dollar.

331
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:47,470
We're not going to have any deductible at all. But then again,

332
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:53,800
we're at a total amount of dollars we're willing to spend because we're going to lose votes if we go above that total amount of dollars.

333
00:35:54,190 --> 00:36:01,630
So if we give us generous coverage for the first dollars to try to entice the low spenders to say, hey, there is some value in this for you.

334
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:07,070
There wouldn't be any value if we put $1,000 deductible on that person who's got a $5 generic.

335
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:15,440
So now we're going to and we definitely want to have catastrophic coverage for those who have lots and lots of expenses.

336
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:20,870
So we have this donut hole where once you spend a certain amount of drugs,

337
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:25,729
you get no coverage at all until you've spent several thousand more dollars out of pocket.

338
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:31,070
Then you'll enter the catastrophic. You never build an insurance plan like that.

339
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:36,720
Except in the political world where you were sort of forced to come up with crazy ideas,

340
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:45,790
to not lose the three more votes you needed to make sure it passed. And then they also imposed a mandate, didn't really call it a mandate.

341
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:53,379
It was really more of the penalty. So you're okay if you don't enroll when you're first eligible for every month you delay or enrollment,

342
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:57,250
your premium is going to go up and it will be up permanently for as long as you're in the program.

343
00:36:57,790 --> 00:37:01,899
So had sort of a carrot and the stick for the low users to join the system.

344
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:05,080
The carrot was their first dollar coverage rather than deductible.

345
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:08,050
So at least you get something out of it if you don't use a lot of meds.

346
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:15,660
And the second was, well, if you wait to sign up, we're going to raise your premium premiums in the future when you do sign up.

347
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:28,160
So we've got that structure. And then I took the ACA in 2011 to start sort of fixing the donut hole because it's kind of ridiculous.

348
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:32,540
So gradually the donut hole was closed to some extent under the ACA.

349
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:39,740
But again, by the 1970s and eighties, everybody was an employer plan, had prescription drug coverage, and none of them had adorable.

350
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:49,159
So. I want to get back to Medicare for All when it gets back to Medicare for All,

351
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:54,770
as we have this plan that's written down on paper for all providers, Medicare rates,

352
00:37:56,580 --> 00:38:03,470
we're going to eliminate costs, co-payments and deductibles, we're going to add dental vision,

353
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:10,550
etc., and it's all going to save money while broadly increasing access.

354
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:14,549
One plan could actually get passed.

355
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:22,440
Suppose Medicare for All has its political moment where the opportunity is there and we get made probably just barely enough votes that we could

356
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:29,970
maybe get something done is probably we know in U.S. health care policy we're trying to bring anything major done with a 99 to 1 vote in the Senate.

357
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:37,860
Are the doctors and hospitals going to push against Medicare rates for all?

358
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:47,730
Oh, yeah. Are they powerful? Because every congressperson have doctors and hospitals in their district.

359
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:55,410
So all of a sudden it'll be. Well, we're all going to go out of business if you pay us Medicare rates for all.

360
00:38:55,710 --> 00:39:00,210
And therefore, nobody in our district is going to get any care because the hospitals are going to close.

361
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:08,540
The doctors are all going to retire early. Drug companies going to stand for that.

362
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:16,410
Drug companies aren't going to stand for that. Are they are these all powerful special interests?

363
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:25,760
So what will actually be passed if and when Medicare for All has its political opportunity is going to look very good.

364
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:31,800
I don't know exactly what it will look like, but I know it's going to look very, very different than what the proposal on paper looks like.

365
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:35,400
Yeah. If you could implement that for paper.

366
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:41,730
You know, the math might work, but you're never going to get that passed.

367
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:48,450
So the political system, the created the ACA, the political system created Medicare, the political system that created Part D.

368
00:39:49,290 --> 00:39:55,710
Those were less polarized political systems than we have now. Medicare for All will have to go through that same political system.

369
00:39:57,060 --> 00:40:02,160
So I can guarantee you that if it has this opportunity is not going to look like what the proposal looks like.

370
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:15,620
So health care industry is going to tremendously fight against anything that's going to increase their prices and mean costs.

371
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:20,090
So some admin costs kind of are through a waste.

372
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:23,900
And then we have a bunch of different insurers with different forms.

373
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:30,440
If we just had one insurer, one is bill one agency with one set of rules.

374
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:40,390
Admin costs would definitely go down. But someday, I mean, costs are for programs that try to control the use of low value services.

375
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:48,430
Those are likely be gone too. So not all admin costs are necessarily a waste.

376
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:51,700
And then the other thing as well,

377
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:56,680
would we give people more coverage if we bring everybody into coverage and we eliminate the deductibles and cost sharing?

378
00:40:57,490 --> 00:40:58,870
People are going to use more care.

379
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:08,020
So we're going to have to hold these savings from lower prices, lower admin costs of big enough to offset the costs of the added care use.

380
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:12,549
So a recent study tried to sort of simulate that and argue that in fact,

381
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:18,010
the increases in costs due to increased coverage under Medicare for All would be relatively modest.

382
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:22,210
But it's kind of interesting say, why would it be relatively modest?

383
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:30,490
They are mainly because of supply side constraints that there aren't enough doctors and hospitals to provide all the care that people would want.

384
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:34,600
If 100% of the population had coverage and had no deductible and no hope,

385
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:41,770
no cost sharing and those costs could break out over time, you get more economic output because you need more physicians.

386
00:41:41,770 --> 00:41:45,429
So you train more physicians.

387
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:50,020
They spend more money on health care, you create more jobs. That money that will be reallocated.

388
00:41:51,370 --> 00:41:55,809
Let's take and let's let's assume you could pass the liberal for any proposal

389
00:41:55,810 --> 00:42:00,340
with no exactly as written and you could offset all these political forces.

390
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:08,290
Physician incomes would go way down. So would it be as attractive to go into medicine?

391
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:13,510
You know, so, yeah, if we you know, if physician incomes stayed the same or went off,

392
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:18,370
you know, eventually we could train more physicians to meet the demand.

393
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:25,920
So essentially it's costs wouldn't actually go up that much for this extra care that would be used.

394
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:30,620
But it's partly because not all the extra care that people would want would actually be supplied and available.

395
00:42:31,170 --> 00:42:37,170
So there would still be limits and rationing or waiting times or other factors that would limit use.

396
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:42,090
So, you know, it's because the access would not go up effectively as much as you think it would.

397
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:48,720
That's why the cost increase would be relatively modest. So a non-priority for or against Medicare for All.

398
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:56,760
But I will argue that if Medicare for All passed, it would look very different from what the proposals look like on paper today.

399
00:42:59,750 --> 00:43:04,950
And that might make the trade offs a little more obvious. Price.

400
00:43:06,370 --> 00:43:13,960
So so far we've been talking about economic theory, micro economic theory of the consumer will later on talk about theory of the firm as well.

401
00:43:15,790 --> 00:43:18,760
And we've got a bunch of assumptions that we've made.

402
00:43:20,310 --> 00:43:26,610
And then we look at health care and we see sort of how radically violated the assumptions seem to be.

403
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:31,259
So we start off talking about utility maximizing consumers,

404
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:37,499
and they've got this set of preferences that somehow they formed and somehow allows them to make good decisions,

405
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:45,890
decisions that they're happy with that they don't regret. Now making health care decisions.

406
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:51,850
What do I actually know when I. I've got some symptom. I go to the doctor.

407
00:43:53,350 --> 00:43:58,630
I don't know what. What I. What condition I have, what the treatments would be, how effective they would be.

408
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:03,210
Is this doctor better than that doctor? Is this hospital better than that hospital?

409
00:44:05,350 --> 00:44:08,380
And also, I also suffer from what's called asymmetric information.

410
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:14,860
The other part of the transaction knows more than I do, and they might take advantage of that.

411
00:44:16,510 --> 00:44:22,809
So how many of you taking your car to a mechanic and then you gotten the recommendation for something and you wondered?

412
00:44:22,810 --> 00:44:30,190
Well, you know, obviously I'm not the expert. I don't know what's wrong with my car and how expensive the fix is.

413
00:44:30,550 --> 00:44:34,240
And I'm told it's going to be $3,000 and this is what's right.

414
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:39,250
And you trust it or not? No. Yeah, exactly. Because we don't have any background.

415
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:43,420
And so you just assume it's right.

416
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:51,970
And so that mechanic, though, if they're a little bit dishonest, has the incentive to recommend a more expensive repair than you really needed.

417
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:57,460
So it's something we worry about when there's asymmetric information.

418
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:01,080
You and I are not the experts on what's wrong with our power and what it would take to fix it.

419
00:45:01,830 --> 00:45:04,860
So we need to go to the experts. We need their expertize.

420
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:14,550
But the fact that they have the expertize and also would be the ones doing the repair gives them an incentive to overstate what the problem is.

421
00:45:21,310 --> 00:45:25,180
So what are utility maximize maximizing consumer spend?

422
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:30,640
They spend somebody else's money or spend their own money, their own money.

423
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:33,370
So that's a powerful incentive to get it right.

424
00:45:34,930 --> 00:45:41,530
You know, if I just kind of like really, really foolish consumer decisions, who's going to have to pay for that foolishness?

425
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:49,540
With me, I'm the one who suffers. You know, if I decide I want a new Mercedes and because of that, I get evicted from my apartment.

426
00:45:52,490 --> 00:45:55,100
I'm the one who's got to sleep outside and certainly get cold.

427
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:03,270
So that gives me a powerful incentive not to buy a mercedes if the consequence is not being able to pay my rent.

428
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:14,790
Now, if I'm going to ensure a patient or I'm a physician treating and insured patient who is money,

429
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:18,930
are we the patient and the physician spending with the decisions we make?

430
00:46:21,390 --> 00:46:26,700
Somebody else's, the insurance companies, the pool. So it's the source, the insurance companies.

431
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:30,240
Money is the premiums paid by all the enrollees. So it's our money.

432
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:33,780
But if I'm one enrollee out of a million, you know,

433
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:40,320
essentially if I get that MRI because my knee hurts rather than waiting a couple of weeks to see if it gets better on its own,

434
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:45,750
I pay 1/1000000 of the cost of that MRI through higher premiums next year.

435
00:46:47,790 --> 00:46:49,890
So essentially that MRI is free to me.

436
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:59,530
So I'm less incentive to worry about it because I'm not going to get evicted from my apartment if I foolishly agree

437
00:46:59,530 --> 00:47:06,760
to have an MRI or foolishly demand an MRI from my doctor in a situation where it really is just a low value thing.

438
00:47:06,970 --> 00:47:07,629
We could do it,

439
00:47:07,630 --> 00:47:14,230
but actually we just wait a couple of weeks because I'm not going to get evicted from my apartment because it's not my money that's being spent.

440
00:47:16,890 --> 00:47:21,240
And also talking about things that are private goods.

441
00:47:22,950 --> 00:47:26,790
Most of the stuff we buy as consumers benefits us and only us.

442
00:47:28,950 --> 00:47:33,270
If I go out for pizza tonight, neither pizza. I'm the only one who ate that pizza.

443
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:39,640
If you want one, you've got to go buy your own. But in health care, they're often public goods.

444
00:47:41,530 --> 00:47:46,749
So if I care about your health, then if you do something detrimental to your health or you don't have access to care,

445
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:58,299
that's going to make me feel bad. Or your behavior might more directly affect me if you don't take good precautions against communicable diseases.

446
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:02,320
You're putting me at risk. If I don't take good precautions, I'm putting you at risk.

447
00:48:04,210 --> 00:48:07,840
If I get my flu vaccine, it helps protect me, but it also helps protect you.

448
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:18,700
Obviously you have things like knowledge creation. Pharmaceutical company develops this great new drug that's really important.

449
00:48:20,110 --> 00:48:21,430
And then we said, well, you know what?

450
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:30,530
We're still not giving you a patent or any other way that you're going to be able to monetize that in the moment that drug is approved.

451
00:48:30,550 --> 00:48:34,780
All the generic companies in the country can produce their own version of it.

452
00:48:37,770 --> 00:48:43,080
Are you spending $1,000,000,000 in research and development over a 10 to 12 year period to bring that drug to market?

453
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:49,080
If the moment you find a successful drug, every generic company in America can build,

454
00:48:49,110 --> 00:48:57,780
can copy it to sell it for a very low price, that, if they want to offer it for now, is that knowledge that is a public good.

455
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:05,470
So we have to then create an incentive, an artificial incentive, essentially, for drug companies to invest in R&D.

456
00:49:06,030 --> 00:49:10,620
I say, okay, if you do find that winning drug, you get to have a monopoly.

457
00:49:10,770 --> 00:49:13,470
You get to be the only one that sells it for a period of years.

458
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:21,670
And generic companies can't or can't enter until your patent has expired because that knowledge is a public good.

459
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,489
So we haven't talked much about firms yet. We'll get to that later.

460
00:49:25,490 --> 00:49:30,709
But as soon as maximize utility firms, we're going to assume sort of the econ one view of the world.

461
00:49:30,710 --> 00:49:35,960
Their main reason to exist is to maximize their profits. That's their main objective that they're trying to follow.

462
00:49:37,670 --> 00:49:43,340
So then in health care, we've got a lot of organizations that are explicitly set up as nonprofits.

463
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:45,779
We have four physicians.

464
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:53,550
We've got the Hippocratic Oath, we've got professional ethics, which specifically says you need to put your patient's interests above your own.

465
00:49:57,060 --> 00:50:01,230
So we've got various things that may sort of try to modify the profit motive.

466
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,200
We talk about the theory of the firm in a perfectly competitive industry.

467
00:50:07,210 --> 00:50:10,690
We're going to say one of the characteristics is there's free entry into that industry.

468
00:50:12,010 --> 00:50:19,140
Whereas if I see that, you know, neurosurgeons are making more money than health economists, I say pay.

469
00:50:19,510 --> 00:50:27,790
No, I quit my job. I'm coming. Neurosurgeon. What am I have to do in order to be able to do that in your world?

470
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:37,669
You all my med school prerequisite the pre rex take my cats get admitted to medical school go to med school

471
00:50:37,670 --> 00:50:44,780
for four years pass two different steps of the licensure exam along the way get a residency in neurosurgery,

472
00:50:47,690 --> 00:50:52,489
probably have to get board certified because a lot of hospitals aren't going to hire me if I'm not a board certified.

473
00:50:52,490 --> 00:51:03,240
So take another test. So all that helps to protect the public from people like me who say neurosurgeons make more money than health economists.

474
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:11,559
So I'm a brain surgeon now. But it creates tremendous barriers to entry and then supports very high earnings

475
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:16,030
for those professions because there are all these hoops you have to jump through,

476
00:51:16,570 --> 00:51:20,590
not open a new hospital, say to Michigan, I have to go get a certificate of need.

477
00:51:20,590 --> 00:51:26,139
I have to go to a state regulatory body and prove to them that the plant in the area of the state that I'm trying

478
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:33,430
to build this hospital in doesn't have as many hospital beds as that state regulatory body thinks the area needs.

479
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:41,200
I can't just say, well, you know, I think there's enough of a market in it that I'm willing to invest my capital and take my risk in building it.

480
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:49,690
I still have to get permission and I have to prove to the state that I meet their requirements, even allowed to build that hospital.

481
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:52,330
And that case has nothing to do with my technical capabilities.

482
00:51:53,770 --> 00:51:58,260
Being a neurosurgeon, I obviously don't have those technical capabilities and those barriers,

483
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:01,510
those regulatory barriers to entry are to protect you from people like me.

484
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:10,120
We don't have the technical abilities. Maybe I have all the technical abilities I would need to run a good hospital.

485
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:14,070
I'm going to hire all the right people. Get all right equipment.

486
00:52:14,670 --> 00:52:18,930
I still am not allowed to do it. I've got this great new drug.

487
00:52:19,530 --> 00:52:26,310
Can I just sell it? I've got to go through phase one, phase two and phase three clinical trials.

488
00:52:26,850 --> 00:52:34,559
And each phase, there's a fairly big risk of failing. Finally, if it gets to the point where the FDA says, Yeah, you've passed all the trials,

489
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:40,620
you've proven your drug is safe and effective for at least one in one specified indication, then I'm allowed to sell it.

490
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:50,100
So again, tremendous regulatory barriers to entry, so very different than our econ one assumption of free entering competitive markets.

491
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:58,620
Our price is determined not to inflame German competitive markets by the interaction of supply and demand.

492
00:53:01,540 --> 00:53:06,850
Our price is determined in health care, but a lot of them are determined by regulatory bodies.

493
00:53:08,370 --> 00:53:13,230
So Medicare sets prices for hospitals and for doctors under fee schedules.

494
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:19,280
A lot of countries regulate drug prices. The U.S. obviously much less so.

495
00:53:21,170 --> 00:53:24,410
Other countries regulate or centrally negotiate drug prices.

496
00:53:25,550 --> 00:53:32,990
So you want to sell your drug in the National Health Service in the in the U.K. then you've got to agree with them on a price.

497
00:53:34,010 --> 00:53:39,530
And if you don't give them a price, they're willing to agree to give them what they perceive as the value of that drug to their system.

498
00:53:40,490 --> 00:53:43,430
Your sales in the EU in the United Kingdom will be exactly zero.

499
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:54,030
By private producers and private purchasers because these firms are so privately owned profit maximizing

500
00:53:54,030 --> 00:54:01,920
entities and then private individuals and households are the consumers of the government as a buyer.

501
00:54:03,150 --> 00:54:07,920
Medicare or Medicaid even has a direct producer, the VA or public hospitals.

502
00:54:09,390 --> 00:54:13,890
So National Health Service in the UK government isn't just the buyer of services.

503
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:20,800
They own the hospitals and they employ the physicians. So again, incredible differences.

504
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:29,200
So she has quit right now. Don't say yes, although you might be thinking it.

505
00:54:30,490 --> 00:54:35,860
Well, is economics at all even useful given that last table?

506
00:54:37,330 --> 00:54:41,350
So again, arrows are the first Nobel laureates in economics.

507
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:48,550
I came and wrote one paper on Health Economics in 1963 and sort of set the research agenda for the field for the next few decades.

508
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:51,730
And then I went off into the environmental economics and other things.

509
00:54:52,960 --> 00:55:00,490
So the definition of a very smart person come in, write one paper, and then set up a whole new discipline.

510
00:55:02,290 --> 00:55:06,010
He said, Well, understanding how health care markets fail.

511
00:55:08,630 --> 00:55:15,080
Helps us understand the way they look. So we already talked about things like nonprofits and professional ethics.

512
00:55:16,010 --> 00:55:21,340
So we see that with the unfettered profit motive, there might be some problems.

513
00:55:21,350 --> 00:55:24,760
When you say asymmetric information or that doctor says, you know, hey,

514
00:55:25,070 --> 00:55:31,010
I'm a bit like the auto mechanic and require and recommend the expensive repair because it makes more money for me.

515
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:41,540
So we try to create structures, medical ethics in that case, at least to some extent, counters that profits out of.

516
00:55:42,290 --> 00:55:48,080
We try to organize some of the providers as nonprofits to at least try to counter that set of how well that works.

517
00:55:49,370 --> 00:55:55,480
Quite variable. And so we find a lot of nonprofit health systems that you look at their behavior,

518
00:55:55,500 --> 00:56:00,830
you don't see where it's really very distinguishable from what a for profit organization would do.

519
00:56:02,030 --> 00:56:05,810
So not completely effective, but it's sort of the reason those things exist in health care.

520
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:16,040
Try to we somewhat temper those adverse incentives that we may be able to learn things.

521
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:21,829
We kind of create mechanisms to help consumers get at least some information.

522
00:56:21,830 --> 00:56:24,770
Some of those are informal mechanisms like provider reputations.

523
00:56:26,790 --> 00:56:34,860
So if you look up your provider's reviews or if you talk to your friends or neighbors, you know, hey, I just moved to town.

524
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:38,060
Are you primary primary care physician? Who do you go to?

525
00:56:38,090 --> 00:56:43,740
You like them? How long does it take to get an appointment? So they take enough time to answer your questions.

526
00:56:45,770 --> 00:56:54,120
You can gain some information. Maybe not perfect, but we saw there's publicly reported data outcomes data, their quality report cards,

527
00:56:54,120 --> 00:57:00,059
Medicare as a whole, five star rating system for almost every type of provider hospitals,

528
00:57:00,060 --> 00:57:10,230
nursing homes, Medicare Advantage, health plans, dialysis facilities, home health agencies, hospitals, I wouldn't say that.

529
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:15,960
So these mechanisms are developed to try to convey at least some information to people.

530
00:57:16,650 --> 00:57:24,580
In fact, your insurance company does some of your shopping for you. They set up networks to monitor the use of low value care.

531
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:29,969
They monitor prescribing habits, negotiate lower prices with them,

532
00:57:29,970 --> 00:57:34,920
because you as an individual consumer at the time of care, probably can't call in the middle of a heart attack and say,

533
00:57:35,370 --> 00:57:35,950
you know, hey,

534
00:57:35,970 --> 00:57:43,680
which hospital in the Ann Arbor is going to be the best deal in treating my heart attack then right in the middle of the like with that.

535
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:49,650
But hopefully your insurance company has done some of that negotiation in advance for you.

536
00:58:01,330 --> 00:58:08,290
So we're talking about there are multiple sources of market failures that kind of lead to suboptimal outcomes that either

537
00:58:09,370 --> 00:58:16,060
markets will themselves try to develop methods to address or policymakers will try to develop efforts to address.

538
00:58:16,930 --> 00:58:21,250
But the market failure is just truly pervasive in healthcare as information problems.

539
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:29,680
So we've already talked about consumers. That was pretty easy to understand. But providers themselves face massive information problems.

540
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:35,860
How many clinical journals are there in any given specialty? Thousands.

541
00:58:35,860 --> 00:58:42,250
Hundreds. So no physician can keep up with all the literature in their own specialty.

542
00:58:42,750 --> 00:58:46,120
And even if, hypothetically, they spent all their free time reading articles,

543
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:53,800
would they have the ability to discern which articles have flaws in their methodology?

544
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:57,520
Maybe they've got, you know, really good methodology training.

545
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:01,329
They can figure out some of those things, but some of those are just going to be hidden.

546
00:59:01,330 --> 00:59:09,130
And it's not going to be possible for the reader to say to see some of the flaws or limitations that might exist in the studies.

547
00:59:09,610 --> 00:59:13,120
So I've got I've got to read them all and then I've got to figure out which ones to actually believe.

548
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:19,420
I've got to make decisions about care, and that goes well beyond anything.

549
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:25,700
Literature. I've got a randomized controlled trial on some procedure or some drug,

550
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:30,110
and it was done a certain number of years ago with the practices that were done at that time.

551
00:59:30,710 --> 00:59:35,510
It was done in a trial setting. So I had people calling you to make sure you're taking your medications.

552
00:59:39,650 --> 00:59:45,860
And I had limits in terms of who got into that trial. Every clinical trial has patient exclusion criteria,

553
00:59:47,090 --> 00:59:56,899
so you have to be between age 50 and age 75 and you have to have a condition that is at least less severe, but not more severe than that.

554
00:59:56,900 --> 01:00:06,520
And you can't have any of these three comorbid conditions. And then we find out the drug works in that population in a trial setting.

555
01:00:07,870 --> 01:00:12,070
But now, as a clinician, I have to say, well, what if I've got a 49 year old in my office?

556
01:00:12,910 --> 01:00:17,170
What if I was 76 year old? We weren't in the trial.

557
01:00:18,130 --> 01:00:25,510
It's like indirectly saying the trial applies to them. What if they have one of these comorbid conditions that excluded them from the trial?

558
01:00:26,810 --> 01:00:31,210
I simply say, Well, they wouldn't have got in the trial, so therefore I'm not going to prescribe the drugs.

559
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:35,880
I've got to make an educated guess. That's exactly what it is.

560
01:00:35,890 --> 01:00:41,080
It's a guess. I'd like to have a randomized controlled trial that applies to every patient

561
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:44,770
in every condition that they might be sitting across from me in the office.

562
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:51,730
I don't. I'm lucky to have 10% of the people I see in a day.

563
01:00:51,740 --> 01:00:54,889
I can point to a randomized controlled trial saying,

564
01:00:54,890 --> 01:01:02,360
I am absolutely sure that based on the current state of knowledge for a patient exactly like you, this is the best thing to do.

565
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:07,310
If I could say that for 10% of the people I see in a day, I'm probably lucky.

566
01:01:10,470 --> 01:01:15,760
We talk about information being asymmetric, where one party potentially has a strategic advantage.

567
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:20,440
So it's not that both parties are equally ignorant. We're both guessing.

568
01:01:20,470 --> 01:01:30,640
One party is more ignorant than the other. So we talked about patients and providers, but also enrollees.

569
01:01:31,330 --> 01:01:33,880
I might have an advantage as a potential insurance enrollee.

570
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:41,490
I know more maybe about my family history, my own health history and preferences for care.

571
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:46,480
Am I somebody that runs in and demands an MRI every time I feel a twinge of pain anywhere in my body?

572
01:01:46,810 --> 01:01:54,800
Or am I someone who says, You know what? I wanna see if this goes away on its own and if it seems serious two weeks from now, then maybe I'll call.

573
01:01:54,830 --> 01:02:01,870
Go in. I know more about all those things than a prospective insurance company who's offering me a policy knows.

574
01:02:02,450 --> 01:02:16,230
So I'm the one with the asymmetric information advantage. Now the union's stance of uncertainty and asymmetric information can be quite variable.

575
01:02:16,890 --> 01:02:21,510
These are divided, different sort of health care services into three groups.

576
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:24,390
First, we call it experience goods.

577
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:33,120
Those are things that it's relatively easy to find out about the things that are most broadly consumed in the population.

578
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:37,770
So I can easily talk to my friends and neighbors there who's a good primary care doc in Ann Arbor.

579
01:02:39,740 --> 01:02:43,790
So I get that type of information. They're relatively well understood.

580
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:48,870
Knowing what I want out of a primary care doc.

581
01:02:48,890 --> 01:02:55,610
I feel a little bit more knowledgeable to say these are the attributes I'm looking for than what I want out of a neurosurgeon.

582
01:02:57,560 --> 01:03:02,150
And once I buy them, I buy them frequently. So if I make a mistake, there's some chance I might learn.

583
01:03:02,630 --> 01:03:08,630
It's like, you know, this primary care doc, you know, they were recommended. Every time I call, I can't get in for four months.

584
01:03:09,620 --> 01:03:14,630
And then when I finally do get in, after four months of waiting, they breeze in and out in 5 minutes.

585
01:03:15,110 --> 01:03:18,269
And don't answer my questions. Okay.

586
01:03:18,270 --> 01:03:23,740
You made a mistake finding your primary care doc. So with experience, I can learn.

587
01:03:24,780 --> 01:03:29,939
There's something called like reputation goods. As an individual, I don't consume them a lot.

588
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:36,570
I don't repeatedly consume them, but they are less broadly consumed in the population, or at least moderately well understood.

589
01:03:38,130 --> 01:03:39,830
Families never had a kid before then.

590
01:03:40,010 --> 01:03:46,620
You know, we haven't had obstetric care, but we can find lots of other people in the area that have gone to obstetricians.

591
01:03:50,110 --> 01:03:56,889
And then there are harder ones called imperfect reputation goods. They're free infrequently, but not by not just by an individual.

592
01:03:56,890 --> 01:04:00,300
They're not recurrently consumed, but they're not frequently bought in population.

593
01:04:00,310 --> 01:04:06,129
I just can't go to the local park and find, you know, ten different parents with their kids playing on the swing set.

594
01:04:06,130 --> 01:04:07,930
And I asked them who their obstetrician was,

595
01:04:08,790 --> 01:04:14,580
if I have some rare condition and there is a procedure in a bone marrow transplant for a rare cancer, you know,

596
01:04:14,590 --> 01:04:18,190
I can't just run out and find these only ten people that I know or ten people that

597
01:04:18,190 --> 01:04:22,090
live in my neighborhood that have had this procedure done in the last two years.

598
01:04:25,990 --> 01:04:30,819
It's very much harder to find out about solving our resolve.

599
01:04:30,820 --> 01:04:38,170
This sort of trilemma of cost, quality and access needs to address multiple sources, market failures, incentives.

600
01:04:38,410 --> 01:04:43,360
So very first day we talked about the ship captains, incentives, the captain, all these incentives.

601
01:04:43,360 --> 01:04:51,220
But originally they were the right incentives to ensure patient with providers paying fee for service.

602
01:04:51,730 --> 01:04:58,080
What's the incentive? Well, more use and even more importantly, in the long run,

603
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:05,670
what type of R&D is there incentive for drug companies or device manufacturers or others to engage in?

604
01:05:06,590 --> 01:05:18,220
And suppose I make a savings and I find a way to make a TV that is 95% as good as what's currently out on the market and 50% cheaper.

605
01:05:18,790 --> 01:05:23,950
I'm looking for investors in my company to bring that product to market.

606
01:05:26,130 --> 01:05:35,070
Anybody interested in investing or that you think that's a good investment. TV was 95% is good and cost only half as much.

607
01:05:35,490 --> 01:05:47,250
I probably can sell that TV if I could bring it to market. So what if I'm a drug manufacturer and by market is well insured patients?

608
01:05:47,910 --> 01:05:51,600
And I say, you know, I got this drug, it's not quite as good as the existing drug is.

609
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:56,790
Almost, almost as good. I swear. It's almost as good and it costs half as much.

610
01:05:58,230 --> 01:06:04,430
Now, you're a fully insured patient. Do you want my drug? So I'm a drug company.

611
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:08,790
What am I going to invest my R&D and things that I think will be not quite as good as existing drugs,

612
01:06:08,790 --> 01:06:14,940
but a lot cheaper or things that are going to be a little better than existing drugs, even if they're quite a bit more expensive.

613
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:21,970
Yes. So my incentives to invest my R&D in the latter, the former.

614
01:06:23,490 --> 01:06:27,510
So the analog of the TV and it's almost as good and half as expensive,

615
01:06:27,630 --> 01:06:33,240
has no future in healthcare under sort of fee for service instead of having sure patients.

616
01:06:41,540 --> 01:06:46,250
Another market failure. We'll talk about our set of market failures is those that limit the extent of competition.

617
01:06:46,850 --> 01:06:55,520
In some markets, we have a great degree of monopoly power, which might be created by the regulations, the regulatory barriers of entry.

618
01:06:55,520 --> 01:07:00,140
We talk to licensure and patents. Those are all regulatory barriers to entry.

619
01:07:00,830 --> 01:07:05,090
There might be good reasons for all these things, but they're going to have side effects.

620
01:07:06,490 --> 01:07:14,000
You know how many drugs don't have a side effect in a drug that does not have a side effect listed on its prescribing information.

621
01:07:15,710 --> 01:07:18,830
If you go to the pharmacy, you get the drug for the first time.

622
01:07:18,830 --> 01:07:25,040
They hand you the sheet with all the information about the drug. If you ever see a side effects, none?

623
01:07:25,090 --> 01:07:28,120
No, never.

624
01:07:28,850 --> 01:07:33,950
So these policies are drugs. They might have a good reason.

625
01:07:33,950 --> 01:07:37,640
They might have benefits, but they're also going to have side effects.

626
01:07:39,900 --> 01:07:46,229
They're not going to be benign, just like no drug is benign and something that's externalities and public goods.

627
01:07:46,230 --> 01:07:49,860
We talk about infectious disease as an extra ality between people.

628
01:07:49,860 --> 01:07:52,960
Where my behavior affects you, your behavior affects me.

629
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:56,960
I'm not bearing all the consequences of my own behavior.

630
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:00,420
You're very sore. If I don't get a flu shot this year, you're more likely to get the flu.

631
01:08:01,380 --> 01:08:10,110
I got one last week, by the way. You're welcome. I've got knowledge creation.

632
01:08:10,560 --> 01:08:16,680
Once I've. Once I've developed that drug that works. If there weren't a patent or something like that, that.

633
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:22,409
Well, you could freely copy it. So Smart Drug Company is the one that just sits there and waits for the other sucker

634
01:08:22,410 --> 01:08:28,020
to invest in the R&D and have all the failures and then copy only the successes.

635
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:42,010
Because once that knowledge is created, it's a public good. So the manual Fuchs wrote an article I've given.

636
01:08:43,050 --> 01:08:44,340
I was 15 years old.

637
01:08:44,730 --> 01:08:51,060
And I think it's kind of interesting because whenever you kind of look at these factors and see what has changed and what hasn't changed,

638
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:55,840
and they argue the U.S. has what they called a perfect storm of over utilization.

639
01:08:56,370 --> 01:09:02,790
There are either sort of seven big factors at play, four on the physician side, the lighter side factors,

640
01:09:02,790 --> 01:09:10,560
three on the patient side that sort of interacts to say, well, in general, we're going to err on the side of doing more health care.

641
01:09:12,810 --> 01:09:18,540
On the physicians side, they are one of those factors is what they call the culture and training, rewarding meticulousness.

642
01:09:20,830 --> 01:09:25,720
The smart medical student in rounds and smart resident rounds up with smart miracles.

643
01:09:26,510 --> 01:09:30,249
The one thought to be smart is the one that comes up with the most exotic

644
01:09:30,250 --> 01:09:35,700
possible diagnosis and the most exotic set of tests to rule out that diagnosis.

645
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:42,810
Rather than the one that says, you know what, this is what it's most likely is,

646
01:09:42,820 --> 01:09:49,020
let's go down that path and then we'll you know, if we rule out that easy thing, then let's figure out the other stuff.

647
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:51,740
So there's just sort of this culture that, you know,

648
01:09:51,750 --> 01:09:57,810
I want to think of everything possible which can have its benefits as well, because sometimes it is the rare thing.

649
01:10:00,430 --> 01:10:07,530
But it just creates a mindset. We already talked about fee for service, payment, basic and service.

650
01:10:07,630 --> 01:10:14,080
The more I do, the more I make. Marketing.

651
01:10:14,470 --> 01:10:18,130
So you talk about doctors try to sort out information in medical journals.

652
01:10:18,850 --> 01:10:20,860
You're also the target of a lot of marketing.

653
01:10:21,340 --> 01:10:29,950
So even in 2008, prescription drug ads and these are ads aimed at doctors, things are published in medical journals, not ads to consumers.

654
01:10:30,460 --> 01:10:36,630
About $10,000 per doctor in ads. It's obviously a lot more now.

655
01:10:37,290 --> 01:10:46,120
This is a flood of little flood of information. What type of drugs are going to be advertised to physicians?

656
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:54,760
Brand name drugs and generic drugs. But there's no money to promote generic drugs, money supply or brand name drugs.

657
01:10:54,770 --> 01:10:59,770
So you're getting bombarded with these messages and messages and messages in the messages?

658
01:10:59,770 --> 01:11:03,819
Never. I got this lot, some generic, really cheap for your patients.

659
01:11:03,820 --> 01:11:08,410
You ought to use this. And it's really just as good as that brand name drug.

660
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:13,360
They're not getting bombarded with that message over and over and over again.

661
01:11:14,230 --> 01:11:23,110
You're getting bombarded with this is the great new drug that's on patent and expensive malpractise and defensive medicine.

662
01:11:24,490 --> 01:11:30,790
And it turns out that the vast majority of malpractise suits are not based on failure to do something.

663
01:11:31,870 --> 01:11:37,450
It's classic defensive medicine, as I. I do attest, because you come in with a headache,

664
01:11:37,810 --> 01:11:45,430
and if it turns out that you were having a big bleed and I didn't do a test to rule that out, I'm going to get sued.

665
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:51,219
Turns out, actually, very few cases are from sort of failure to diagnose or failure to do something.

666
01:11:51,220 --> 01:11:55,690
The vast majority, majority of cases are because something went wrong in something that was done.

667
01:11:56,440 --> 01:12:01,629
There was a surgery that went wrong. Now, it may have may have been the surgeons fault, may not have been the surgeons fault.

668
01:12:01,630 --> 01:12:08,140
That's what that's what the courts are going to determine. Do the vast majority of malpractise cases are not a failure to diagnose,

669
01:12:08,140 --> 01:12:14,690
so defensive medicine may not be as helpful to doctors in avoiding sweets as they might think,

670
01:12:14,690 --> 01:12:18,760
because the vast majority of them are issues of cognition, not omission, in a sense.

671
01:12:20,230 --> 01:12:25,450
But still, that could be the same culture and patient factors.

672
01:12:26,350 --> 01:12:36,400
They argue that particularly American patients kind of have an assumption that you were a more expensive is an error is inherently better.

673
01:12:37,270 --> 01:12:45,070
We're not very conservative about you know what that existing drug has got you know a couple of decades of safety information on it.

674
01:12:45,940 --> 01:12:48,040
That new drug has just gone through trials.

675
01:12:48,040 --> 01:12:54,879
It maybe doesn't have that track record and maybe the bad events aren't going to show up until it's in general practice.

676
01:12:54,880 --> 01:13:04,320
So you're not going to stick with the tried and true, you know, instead we hear about all these new drugs on the news and ads, etc. We want the uteri.

677
01:13:09,230 --> 01:13:18,410
Right to consumer advertising. Those of you from other countries or have traveled, we've seen drug ads aimed at consumers in other countries.

678
01:13:21,700 --> 01:13:26,460
Because the US and New Zealand. So if you've been to New Zealand, you've seen prescription drug ads.

679
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:30,800
I've never would love to go, but not just to see the prescription drugs.

680
01:13:33,350 --> 01:13:41,590
So if you're in the US, you've seen how many prescription drugs that he's seen in the last year in magazines and online.

681
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:47,360
Every time you look as you can, especially if you've ever made the mistake of searching for anything health related.

682
01:13:49,340 --> 01:13:55,220
I remember getting prescription drug ads for the next three weeks on every website you open your TV.

683
01:13:57,800 --> 01:14:01,130
So in the mid 2000, there was $4 billion a year.

684
01:14:01,790 --> 01:14:06,949
Obviously, it's now prescription drug as good or bad.

685
01:14:06,950 --> 01:14:11,660
And how would you answer that question? What criteria would you use to say on net?

686
01:14:12,470 --> 01:14:19,040
Are we better off for allowing drug companies to advertise directly to consumers or should we balance?

687
01:14:19,700 --> 01:14:20,980
If you had to do one or the other,

688
01:14:20,990 --> 01:14:33,290
either they can do it the way they do it now or we're going to join the rest of the non New Zealand world in that cost effectiveness.

689
01:14:35,210 --> 01:14:40,820
I mean, you look at quality adjusted life years, they'd be hard to find and overall cost.

690
01:14:41,750 --> 01:14:45,590
So what are a lot of the drug ads telling you to do to a doctor?

691
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:52,100
Go talk to your doctor. So obviously, you know, we have a system where you can't go to the pharmacy and say, I saw this ad on TV, give me the drug.

692
01:14:52,760 --> 01:14:59,330
You have to get a prescription. So the question is, were people being undertreated before the ad?

693
01:14:59,750 --> 01:15:06,920
And we're getting appropriate candidates for therapy coming in to the doctor and getting the medication,

694
01:15:07,130 --> 01:15:10,790
who wouldn't have come in to the doctor and gotten the men without the ad pushing them?

695
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:18,740
Or are we getting people coming in to the doctor and saying, you know, I saw this ad, I want this drug.

696
01:15:19,370 --> 01:15:21,020
And the doctors kind of like, you know what?

697
01:15:21,530 --> 01:15:29,840
I don't think you're really an ideal candidate for this drug, but you really want it and you're pushing the doctor and the doctor's like, okay.

698
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:37,370
So I got patients every 15 minutes so I can sit down with you for an hour and try to counsel you out of this drug,

699
01:15:38,090 --> 01:15:42,260
at which point you're pissed off at me and you're going to pick a different doctor.

700
01:15:43,070 --> 01:15:47,750
And my next three patients are pissed off at me because I'm white and they're going to find a different doctor.

701
01:15:48,140 --> 01:15:49,970
Or I could just write the damn prescription.

702
01:15:53,010 --> 01:15:59,100
And so if you think most people going that are motivated to go see their doctor buy ads or like that first group of people,

703
01:15:59,460 --> 01:16:05,520
the appropriate areas for this therapy they're undertreated and the ad is encouraging

704
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:08,190
them to come in and talk to their doctor and now they're getting treated,

705
01:16:08,190 --> 01:16:13,290
maybe not even with that drug that they came in for, maybe with some other drug, but they're now being effectively treated.

706
01:16:13,290 --> 01:16:17,100
So maybe we know too few people treated for clinical depression.

707
01:16:19,070 --> 01:16:25,620
So drug ads for antidepressants may be on net beneficial to society if they bring in

708
01:16:25,870 --> 01:16:30,710
people who are being undertreated to currently in and get them in for effective therapy.

709
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:40,340
So the question is, you know, is it more like that or is it more like the second story of the person is not really an appropriate candidate coming in.

710
01:16:40,490 --> 01:16:44,150
And then the doctor writes them the prescriptions and get them out of their office.

711
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:50,230
It may well be for some drugs that are like and some drugs are likely.

712
01:16:51,070 --> 01:16:54,670
So on that one, you have to say, well, which one is more likely?

713
01:16:57,470 --> 01:17:00,020
And of course, somebody else is paying for it.

714
01:17:03,580 --> 01:17:09,430
So all these factors, sort of our interactive and reader mutually reinforcing, you know, which ones might have changed a little bit.

715
01:17:13,050 --> 01:17:19,440
Where we are somewhat moving away from pure fee for service payment towards value based methods still in a very piecemeal way.

716
01:17:19,450 --> 01:17:21,479
We'll talk about that more later in class.

717
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:31,530
But kind of the bottom line is going to be basically that value based, some value based payment programs have worked a little bit.

718
01:17:35,580 --> 01:17:37,860
That doesn't mean that they won't work better in the future,

719
01:17:37,860 --> 01:17:43,460
as we've learned a lot about what does and doesn't work and we're moving to things like more or concentrations.

720
01:17:43,470 --> 01:17:47,430
It's not just like one payer is doing this program and then others aren't,

721
01:17:47,430 --> 01:17:54,360
and then you don't have a clear incentive to the providers because every patient is different, is different in terms of what the incentives are.

722
01:17:56,040 --> 01:17:58,800
So, you know, this is a little movement away from some of the service payments.

723
01:17:58,810 --> 01:18:05,890
We've learned some of what doesn't work, unfortunately, but at least we know some of the things that don't work worked and probably hasn't changed.

724
01:18:05,910 --> 01:18:13,160
Malpractise probably hasn't changed that much. Some things have changed significantly.

725
01:18:13,610 --> 01:18:17,420
End of life care is dramatically different than it was several decades ago.

726
01:18:18,040 --> 01:18:24,080
It's a much more palliative approach, much more likely to use options.

727
01:18:26,430 --> 01:18:33,839
We're advanced directives. So there's been a big change in end of life care and we get the same incentives.

728
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:36,480
We're moving away from this sort of pure fee for service.

729
01:18:36,910 --> 01:18:44,430
We're also doing value based campaigns on patients and offering patients incentives to do the high value things and not do the low value things.

730
01:18:44,430 --> 01:18:51,810
And we'll have Dr. Mark friend Rick in October 24th to talk about value based insurance design.

731
01:18:55,910 --> 01:19:03,860
So summarize cost, quality and access trilemma a fundamental conundrum for health policy making in our global tradeoffs,

732
01:19:03,860 --> 01:19:06,740
even where sometimes we pretend those tradeoffs don't exist.

733
01:19:08,300 --> 01:19:16,070
We've got this potential perfect storm over utilization, and then the rest of the course is going to be sort of dealing with these issues.

734
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:24,170
How are we going to be how can we sort of markets privately or as policymakers triangle affect these issues?

735
01:19:25,460 --> 01:19:30,710
So 2 minutes left us students comments, reactions.

736
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:56,660
Let's go in front of the rest of the semester. But now.
