1
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:35,600
All right. Okay. How is everyone?

2
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,050
How is everyone doing? Pretty good. Okay.

3
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:44,600
It's getting chilly now and it's the best time of the year.

4
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:50,810
You know, the trees started changing colors and all kinds of activities.

5
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:57,240
Have you guys started planning for the Greek? There are so many things I can do.

6
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:05,130
And if this is the first time you come to an amber, definitely explore.

7
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:09,060
Now is the best time in a couple of months. There will be snow everywhere.

8
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:15,150
It's not going to be so much fun. So this is the best time anyway.

9
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,650
So let's get started on today's recitation section.

10
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:29,659
Um. So I don't know the that the the the progress of the session too,

11
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:37,700
but we have covered the expectation and the transformation of the random variable in session one.

12
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,819
And then we're going to look at a couple of questions now,

13
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:51,290
going to show you how those knowledge that we learned in class actually can be applied in this to solving to solve this questions.

14
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:54,200
Okay. So let's first of all have the first question.

15
00:01:55,100 --> 00:02:01,370
By the way, both questions that I'm going to talk about today actually are the midterm questions from last year.

16
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:04,940
So you can get a sense of, you know, what's expected.

17
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:12,680
Okay. So let's look at the first question first. Actual signs are important.

18
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:19,460
Strategy is the strategy of proportional re-insurance, which means the insurance company,

19
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:28,160
which is the insurer in this in this question, partner with a reinsurance company called the reinsurer.

20
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:39,170
The insurer agrees to pay the reinsurer agrees to pay the excess of any claim over a great amount necessary to be a.

21
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:47,270
Okay. So if a person who buys insurance has an accident, he or she will file a claim.

22
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:56,750
That amount can be small, can be large. So the insurance and the insurance company, typically, they don't have, you know, unlimited resources.

23
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:04,360
So they have to resort to some. Someone else who has more resources to insure that.

24
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:08,780
So the insurance company will pay up to a certain amount.

25
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:14,730
Anything that exceed that amount is going to be paid by the reinsurer reinsurance company.

26
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:26,569
That's sort of the idea. So if we. Assume that random variable acts denote the amount of a claim and assume that AX has

27
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:34,340
a distribution with the PDF of this small facts of ax or ax from zero to infinity.

28
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:40,320
We further denote these assets here.

29
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:52,670
So this is the first amount, which is the agreement between the two companies, this random variable X, which is the amount of the claim.

30
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:55,760
And we have this two additional amount.

31
00:03:55,850 --> 00:04:03,560
One is U, one is v, u is defined to be the minimum of X and A, so that's going to be the amount paid by the insurer.

32
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:13,820
Okay. If the if the actual claim X is a below this amount A, that's going to be entirely paid by the insurance company.

33
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:20,390
So if it's above a, then the insurance company only pay up to a money.

34
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:31,970
So this minimum of accident going to be the actual amount paid by the insurer and V going to be the excessive amount paid by the reinsurer.

35
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:39,680
So that's going to have this. Formula, which is the maximum of zero and X minus eight.

36
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:44,090
So again, if ask is below eight, then you pay zero.

37
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:50,000
If actually is above a, you paid whatever that is above a x minus eight.

38
00:04:50,420 --> 00:05:02,540
So that's the idea. So that's the the question, the setup, again, three or four major quantities to keep in mind a is the agreed upon amount,

39
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:06,290
which is a constant x is a random variable, which is the.

40
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:16,380
The amount of the claim you is the amount paid by the insurer vs the amount paid by the reinsurer.

41
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:22,680
Okay. So the poor amount. All right. Now let's take a look at the questions.

42
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:31,140
First question. And also us to show that the expectation of the amount paid by the insurer.

43
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:51,750
VCU, which is the month high paid by the insurer, is equal to these quantity.

44
00:05:52,140 --> 00:06:01,130
The expectation of the claim minus this integration from A to infinity x minus a f that self the x ray.

45
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:14,240
And then with this, we can further show that the expected amount paid by an insurer is actually less or equal to the the actual claim.

46
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:19,120
Okay. So. I'll give you a couple minutes.

47
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:27,520
Try to. Prove this relation between the expectation of you and the right hand side.

48
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:32,290
Think about how you is defined and.

49
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,640
Try to draw down something to see whether you can prove this or not.

50
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,250
For your convenience. I'll just survive the. Uh, notation here.

51
00:06:45,340 --> 00:10:27,630
Uh. All right.

52
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,410
Any thoughts out of this?

53
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:41,650
Yes. You can divide. You can argue that you must be.

54
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:55,280
You must. Do you like to dress from there?

55
00:10:57,470 --> 00:11:00,480
It's part of the. And the past.

56
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:05,970
You're integral to the humility and the function a part.

57
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:13,820
And because we know that we should prepare for the next steps.

58
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:18,620
So these are the two parts.

59
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:27,020
The first quality. I know. Great.

60
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:33,460
Great. So let me summarize the idea. So what's your name?

61
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:42,520
Tamara. So what Jared just mentioned is essentially working from the left direction to the right direction.

62
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:44,890
Right. So we start from the left hand side.

63
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:52,810
Since the U is expressed as the minimum of Axon A essentially you can break down this random arrow into two parts.

64
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:59,740
One is that x lastly less are equal to A than just the US, just equal to ox.

65
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:04,080
On the other hand, if ox is greater than eight then it says a constant eight.

66
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:09,410
Then from there you can break down this expectation into two parts.

67
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:14,860
One is integrating over this zero to a, the other is integrating about eight to infinity.

68
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:18,250
Essentially, that's an idea. Okay. So that's one way to do it.

69
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:25,450
Alternatively, we can, you know, maybe make it more rigorous by following the definition that we have learning clause.

70
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:32,890
That is, if you really think about what this you is right the left hand side is calculating the expectation of a of you.

71
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:40,000
So you of course it's a random variable because it's a function of the original random variable X.

72
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:44,480
All right, so let's start from the basic activities of running Marvel.

73
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:51,950
This you is a minimum of X and some constant a. So conceptually that's also a random variable because it's a function.

74
00:12:53,780 --> 00:13:02,659
Of your original roundabout. You can always write in as a as some function g of X, and in this case,

75
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:09,770
the particular formula for G is just a minimum function between the argument and a constant a.

76
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:15,020
All right. So then what's on the left hand side essentially becomes.

77
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:26,220
This guy, right? That's what we are trying to calculate the expectation of this transformation of the random variable.

78
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:30,660
We know the formula for this. That's how we define expectation in the first place.

79
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:34,920
That is what nicknamed infinity to infinity.

80
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:38,850
Clark's facts are facts. The.

81
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:47,790
That's just the definition. All right. And in this case, we know, as always, is always greater than zero.

82
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,930
So that is to say, this is from zero, an infinity.

83
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:54,710
CVACs are acts of X.

84
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:05,530
Okay. So far, so good. And now we need to look into this functional form of what it really is.

85
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:11,380
So it's the minimum of X and A. Another way to write it is.

86
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:19,040
You can write it as an x plus A minus x.

87
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:37,560
Uh. Yes.

88
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:53,190
That's where. You can take advantage of that, this indicator function.

89
00:14:55,090 --> 00:15:02,440
To help us rewrite this minimum function as really a function that it can be easily integrated.

90
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:13,690
Okay. So if you think about how this minimum works, how this minimum operation works, it's essentially just taking the original axiomatic.

91
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:20,260
Plus the difference between the A and the X value times a indicator function.

92
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:24,850
If access is greater than A, then this indicator is one.

93
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:29,140
Right? So this amount is going to be what a.

94
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:35,510
Because it's going to be an X plus. A minus X is equal to the constant eight.

95
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:42,590
But if acts as a less or equal to a, then this indicator will just become zero.

96
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:49,790
So all you have left is just the axis. So this is exactly equal to x.

97
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:59,060
If X is less or equal to A and it's equal to A, if x is greater than.

98
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:05,630
Is this another way to write this function? You then the syndicate or function.

99
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:10,940
And later you will say why we want to race across this formula, race,

100
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:15,590
express this function using the indicator function only because we're going to

101
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:20,810
need to integrate it and the integrated function will simplify the integration.

102
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:26,540
So now we have a equivalent form of this function. Form. We can just plug it in.

103
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:34,790
Right. And we can have this new formula, which is X plus A minus x.

104
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:39,290
I'm indicator. That's greater than a.

105
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:55,140
Acts of acts. The acts. What I did is just plug in the the equivalent form of this GCS function.

106
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:59,280
Now we can rewrite this integration since you can.

107
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:10,370
Break down this bracket. It's not going to be zero to infinity X times as fast as the x plus.

108
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:16,580
This a minus ax I ax greater than a.

109
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:21,340
Facts. The X. Okay.

110
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:28,700
So what is the first time? That's expectation of X.

111
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:33,290
By definition, again, that's an expectation of our run of our blogs.

112
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:39,040
And what about the second one? Now this year,

113
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:45,340
this indicator function will play a role since we have an indicator for acts greater than a

114
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:53,230
that basically shrank your integration set from zero to infinity now to eight to infinity.

115
00:17:53,830 --> 00:18:00,700
So that just become the second term that is eight to infinity a.

116
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:06,450
Minus X. Attacks ax the ax.

117
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:12,600
Or you can put a minus sign and you know, I can't give you exactly what's.

118
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,610
In the first one. Okay. So that complete the proof.

119
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:26,560
So to solve this question, really the case to notice you is just a function of your random variable.

120
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:31,450
Once you notice that, then the rest is just follows the definition.

121
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:39,490
I write out what is the expectation of this function of random variable is and gradually you work out the right hand side.

122
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:47,069
Okay. Any question? Okay.

123
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:53,370
So once we have the first part, then the second. The second part is just follow through.

124
00:18:54,330 --> 00:19:04,050
Naturally, the second part asks us has to show that the expected amount paid by the insurer is lower under this strategy.

125
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:12,660
In other words, we need to show the expectation of you, which is the actual amount paid by an insurer is last or equal to.

126
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:23,480
The expectation of X the claim because without a strategy, the expectation or the claim expects to suffer x is what the insurer has to pay.

127
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:27,360
Now, with the strategy, the expectation of you is what?

128
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,130
And we have to pay. This is what do we what do we need to prove?

129
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:39,830
And if you look at this formula, this equation that we just prove, that is equivalent to say this part is greater or equal to zero.

130
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:49,940
And why is that? Great. I've got a zero. While you're doing the integration right.

131
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:58,910
And the integration is from A to infinity. And if you look at inside this integration, everything is positive or negative in that region.

132
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:05,910
So of course, if you calculate the integration of that non-active function, it's always going to be non-active.

133
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:13,350
So this part is always carried out equal to zero. That's why each of you is always the last one point of every year of X.

134
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:22,460
So that makes sense. Okay. So we can also ask another question.

135
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:26,270
What is each of we?

136
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:33,230
Right. How do we calculate that?

137
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:45,290
While the same thing, right? Because V is also a function of x regardless of how V is expressed, how V is defined.

138
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,600
After all of this fancy shell, after you pay it off.

139
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:54,170
If this is essentially just a function of that's.

140
00:20:55,580 --> 00:21:03,230
So that's how we can calculate this expectation of, at the end of the day, still an expectation of some function of X.

141
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:06,680
So just follow the definition and you can work it out.

142
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:21,650
Alternatively, there's a, uh, um, uh, an easier way, but a trickier way to calculate this is to notice that actually we have an equation, right?

143
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:26,430
This ax is actually equal to you. Plus, we.

144
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:35,900
All right. Because of how you and we are defined.

145
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:41,660
You is defined as a minimum of X and a v is defined as the excessive amount.

146
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:48,860
So if you added those two conceptually, it's the it's the total amount is the total amount of the claim.

147
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:52,729
So this equation holds X is equal to you.

148
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:58,910
Plus we love one side is one run of our variable. Right hand side is the summation of two round of variables.

149
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:08,600
And in this case, life is equal to the right. Doesn't mean that we have equal distribution, but in this case, it's actually we are exactly equal.

150
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:16,730
Okay. And then we can directly calculate E of V to the E of x minus e of u.

151
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:24,510
Given what we have calculated in in the first part, we can directly write it up.

152
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:32,520
That's essentially just the integration of a to infinity x minus a f of x, the x.

153
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:41,770
So you can verify that if you go from the definition by treating V as a function of X, you would got exactly the same result.

154
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:47,020
Or you can take this trickier and probably easier shortcut.

155
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:52,360
By noticing the relation between this different run of variables. All right.

156
00:22:53,130 --> 00:23:00,630
Any question? So again, the bottom line is.

157
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:07,930
Don't be fooled by this. Different notations really pay attention to what the court is.

158
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:13,430
The court is you are calculating the expectation of some function of the of.

159
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:20,620
Once you notice that the Razzies just do the calculation. And that's the first part.

160
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:29,890
And second part, if we assume the facts are facts that this should be the PDF for this run about blacks has this formula.

161
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:34,120
Later on you will learn this is not exponential distribution.

162
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:46,670
Find the value a such that the average claim amount paid by the insurer, which is the e of you, right.

163
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:55,880
That's the average claim amount paid by the insurer is reduced by 20% using this proportional strategy.

164
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:03,510
Is the question clear? So the question asks you to find the value.

165
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,640
A This capital. A It's a great amount,

166
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:15,520
agreed amount between the insurer and the reinsurer so that the average claim

167
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:20,830
amount paid by an insurer each of you is a reduced by 20% under this strategy.

168
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:27,960
Huh? So let me just give you what you need to solve this.

169
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:35,460
Uh, you need these, which is when we just showed.

170
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:42,610
So you can use this revelation from the first question to help you calculate the second question.

171
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:04,600
So why don't you give it a shot? Say how to prove this?

172
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:18,560
How to calculate this? So first, try to translate this problem into a mathematical problem and try to figure out what these conditions are.

173
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:29,970
What does a condition tells us? And then leased out leased out the the formulas, the equations, and then try to solve it.

174
00:25:32,280 --> 00:28:30,459
So break it down two steps. All right.

175
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:38,020
Let's look at this question together. So first up, we need to translate this condition into a mathematical equation.

176
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:46,470
Right. So the man condition or the man result that we can leverage on is this statement.

177
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:52,180
The average claim amount paid by the insurer is reduced by 20% and as a strategy.

178
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:57,720
So how do we translate that in using the notations that we have?

179
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:14,670
What is the mathematical equation? Does that imply? So how do we write out the formula for that?

180
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:20,480
The average claim paid by an insurer is reduced by 20%.

181
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:32,400
And under this strategy with, as I imply. Very good.

182
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:37,030
The expectation of you is point eight times.

183
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:45,620
The expectation of, as I recall, that expectation of X is the expected value of the claim.

184
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:51,799
And I was, as we argued in the first part, without a strategy.

185
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:55,250
That's the exact amount the insurance company is going to pay.

186
00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:03,040
If I know this strategy, the average claim I'm paid by the insurer is reduced by 20%.

187
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:10,300
That is exactly translated to these equation. Each of you is equal to 2.8 times E of x.

188
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:20,130
And that's actually the key of this question. Once you have this equation, then that is to plug in this formulas and do the calculation,

189
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:27,330
really that the hard part is how to translate this this description into this mathematical formula.

190
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:33,490
All right. So once we have that, we come plugging in what we have from the first question.

191
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:37,720
We know each of you has this formula. So what that means is.

192
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:52,120
Yup. Adds minus a to infinity x minus a half as well as yes equal to 0.8 of x.

193
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:58,750
Okay. So that's just a plug in. What do we have in the previous.

194
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:10,590
Question And then we have on to your bags equal to eight to infinity x minus A affects x.

195
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:16,860
The US. Okay. And we know the pdf for x.

196
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:27,690
So we can calculate what this box is as a function of this parameter, a right and the right hand side.

197
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:34,680
You can also do this integration and got another function of both a capital A and Alpha.

198
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:42,830
By solving this equation conceptually, you should be able to find the value a such that it becomes an equation.

199
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:52,090
All right. I'll give you another couple minutes to try to calculate the left hand side, the right hand side, and then solve for this capital value.

200
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:55,900
Okay. Hope you already solved it. So the expectation of X,

201
00:33:56,290 --> 00:34:04,030
we can write it right out the the formula for the expectation that says that integration from zero to infinity X times this PDF function.

202
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,230
And as we saw in clause you can do it integration by part.

203
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:12,159
Okay. And I give you with some derivation.

204
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:17,440
You can end up with this alpha. And similarly, you can do the integration by part to solve the right hand side,

205
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:23,320
which eventually gave you the alpha times e to the negative capital M over alpha.

206
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:28,080
Okay. Now, just plug those two in your equation.

207
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:35,040
You would have got 0.2 alpha equal to alpha times E to the negative eight alpha.

208
00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:42,750
And that just tells us A is equal to the negative natural log of point two.

209
00:34:44,490 --> 00:34:51,240
Times Alpha, which is around 1.61 Alpha.

210
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:54,440
And not solve this problem.

211
00:34:55,460 --> 00:35:06,710
If you said you are a great amount value a to be 1.61 alpha, then the average amount paid by the insurer is reduced by 20%.

212
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:12,170
I know this strategy. Okay. Any question.

213
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:20,730
So to solve this question, what we did is to break down it into several steps.

214
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:28,380
The first step and the most important step is to translate this description into some mathematical formula or equation.

215
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:37,220
All right. Once you have that, then the RASA is just following this procedure to calculate each quantity in this equation.

216
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:41,290
Plug it in. Solve the equation. And it got final result.

217
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:44,530
Okay. Questions? No.

218
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:49,870
Okay, good. All right. So next question. Um, which is slightly trickier.

219
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:53,600
So I trim it from the previous exam. Um.

220
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:59,890
Assume Y is a continuous random variable with cdf capital f of y.

221
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:04,120
Y is from negative infinity to infinity with mean minimal.

222
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:08,800
The question is calculate what this integration is.

223
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:19,090
Integration of 0 to 1. This inverse function of the CDF f y uh integrated from 0 to 1.

224
00:39:56,770 --> 00:41:33,300
If you stop it, just show me your hand. Know. All right, maybe we can look at this together.

225
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:47,100
There are different ways to solve this problem. You can approach it from a pure calculus approach to solve this calculation in this integration.

226
00:41:47,580 --> 00:42:01,810
I. Zero two one half y inverse x the x one way is to do a change of variable, which is a common technique in calculus.

227
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:10,860
If we denote this entire thing, this f y inverse x as a new round of variable, let's see y appended note.

228
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:16,510
Y to be this app y inverse of x.

229
00:42:16,990 --> 00:42:20,200
Just change our variable y is just a function of x.

230
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:23,980
Then the original integration now becomes what?

231
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:30,560
First we need to, uh, uh, let's first write out the, what's in the integration.

232
00:42:30,770 --> 00:42:35,620
So now act one universe acts becomes. Actually.

233
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:53,210
Becomes why? Right. And you are. Second part of us now becomes the x, y, inverse x, and we also need to change this integration up around Laura.

234
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:57,310
So if Y takes if X takes values 0 to 1.

235
00:42:57,670 --> 00:43:01,940
This half y inverse of x. Based on the press.

236
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:09,800
That description is a clear function for a continuous random variable from infinity to infinity.

237
00:43:10,070 --> 00:43:14,930
So the inverse function that maps 0 to 1 to an active infinity to infinity.

238
00:43:15,650 --> 00:43:21,180
So the integration. Bound would be an active infinity to infinity.

239
00:43:21,450 --> 00:43:26,010
Okay, so that's just pure calculus. Just change our variable.

240
00:43:26,850 --> 00:43:31,800
All right. And once you do that, you can further rewrite this part.

241
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:39,500
So it's going to be. The derivative of this inverse function using the.

242
00:43:42,450 --> 00:43:46,520
Actually. There's no mistake here.

243
00:43:49,950 --> 00:43:57,570
So if Y is defined as the Apple II Amos X, now we know X is what and why of why.

244
00:43:58,470 --> 00:44:02,710
So that's the relation. So we replace the of x by B of f.

245
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:09,280
Y. Y. Okay. So that's the that's it away, right away to the right.

246
00:44:09,310 --> 00:44:16,600
And so then we can calculate this derivative of the F while y and what's that.

247
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:26,380
A PDF right? If you take it the derivative of a CDF, I give you the PDF and then it becomes this.

248
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:33,110
Now. What is this now? That's just how we define expectation.

249
00:44:34,210 --> 00:44:40,620
Right. So that is just expectation of y, which is merely.

250
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:47,120
So that is one way to calculate this quantity just from calculus.

251
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:53,149
To do this, change our variable and then use the definition of expectation.

252
00:44:53,150 --> 00:44:58,400
You can got it. Okay. But there's another way.

253
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:02,170
That is a. Another way to solve this problem.

254
00:45:02,470 --> 00:45:13,210
That is also very neat. So we are doing this integration from zero to 1fy inverse acts v of x.

255
00:45:17,770 --> 00:45:28,450
It's equivalent to right as a expectation of some function of a uniform random variable because we notice

256
00:45:28,450 --> 00:45:35,440
that you can multiply a one here and recall that for a uniform uniform random variable from 0 to 1.

257
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:49,900
The pdf is just the one is a constant. So this is equivalent to say this is the expectation of after I am hours of capital X.

258
00:45:50,850 --> 00:45:55,350
Where as follows a uniform distribution from 0 to 1.

259
00:45:58,310 --> 00:46:05,920
All right. That's sort of a inverse thinking about using this expectation.

260
00:46:08,370 --> 00:46:13,080
Now regional integration is essentially a expectation of this.

261
00:46:14,030 --> 00:46:19,010
Transformed random variable where acts follows a uniform distribution.

262
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:27,210
Here we are calculating the expectation of this transformed random variable f y inverse of x forgot about a what?

263
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:38,520
Why is it just a transformation? It's just a function. So does everyone say the connection between the original integration and this expectation?

264
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:43,720
We can always rewrite our original integration.

265
00:46:44,170 --> 00:46:47,620
This expectation where acts follows a uniform distribution.

266
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:54,310
Okay. And now let's take a look at what this transformer random variable is.

267
00:46:54,970 --> 00:46:58,440
So have y inverse of ours recalling clause.

268
00:46:58,450 --> 00:47:08,110
We have a very strong theorem saying that by any continuous random variable if you apply the CDF to that particular random variable.

269
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:13,130
That transformation will always convert that random variable to a uniform random variable.

270
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:20,900
What that means or what that is equivalent to is if you apply the university function to a uniform random variable,

271
00:47:21,410 --> 00:47:27,140
you will always got a continuous random variable that follows that same CDF.

272
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:33,730
So here is you can use that theorem. X is a uniform amount of arable.

273
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:37,210
This A4 y inverse is a university function.

274
00:47:38,390 --> 00:47:46,790
So what that means, if you apply this transformation to the univariate random variable, it follows a distribution which have a video of what?

275
00:47:49,550 --> 00:48:00,220
This will be a random variable y. This will be a random variable y which follows this y.

276
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:05,380
The CDF have the having the city of capital half of the Y.

277
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:11,160
So this is I mean, right in this notation.

278
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:20,310
So this guy on the left hand side, this apple y inverse of X or ax is a uniform on a variable has a same distribution with Y.

279
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:26,880
Where? Why has the city off of AV? Why? Okay.

280
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:32,110
Now the original expectation becomes the expectation.

281
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:38,240
Either way. And we know that is just the.

282
00:48:41,010 --> 00:48:44,070
So that's another way to solve this question.

283
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:53,880
Of course, it can make it more complicated by maybe adding a square of this function or doing further transformation of this function.

284
00:48:55,080 --> 00:49:03,120
But the idea is the same it can always be redone as the expectation of some transformation of this a uniform random variable.

285
00:49:04,690 --> 00:49:10,330
Okay. And you can work out that the rest. So these are two ways to solve this problem.

286
00:49:10,930 --> 00:49:17,709
And they all both have the same. Answer this integration.

287
00:49:17,710 --> 00:49:21,260
I'm going to be equal to the mean. So this is a.

288
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:36,520
Another question. Any question about this one? All right.

289
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:41,650
So I hope this two questions give you a sense of, you know, the utility of.

290
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:49,230
The basic definition that we learn in class and see how this can be used in different scenarios.

291
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:53,820
And again, as I said, these are the midterm questions from last year.

292
00:49:53,910 --> 00:49:58,620
You get a sense of what you are expected, right? What the expectation is.

293
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:05,490
So, yeah, so there are tricks that you can learn.

294
00:50:05,790 --> 00:50:11,130
And there are also the most important thing is always follow the definition, right?

295
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:17,700
Break down the problem into steps. Try to solve each step sequentially, eventually walk out there.

296
00:50:18,330 --> 00:50:23,760
And for many questions, there are of multiple ways to solve it, no matter how you approach it.

297
00:50:24,630 --> 00:50:31,410
Hopefully, eventually, you can solve it in one way or another and always think about alternative ways to solve the same problem as well.

298
00:50:31,950 --> 00:50:38,710
Okay. Any question. Okay.

299
00:50:39,490 --> 00:50:43,680
That's all I have prepared today. No question that would be all for today.

300
00:50:43,690 --> 00:50:47,530
And thank everyone for coming back to take any question if you have.

301
00:50:48,550 --> 00:50:52,980
I'll stay here for a couple of minutes. So. That's it.
