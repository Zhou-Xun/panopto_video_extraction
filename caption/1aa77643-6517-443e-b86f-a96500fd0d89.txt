00:00:05,686 --> 00:00:07,719
Welcome to this lecture on food and
activity environments.

2
00:00:07,719 --> 00:00:10,856
In this lecture, we will learn
about the food environment and

3
00:00:10,856 --> 00:00:12,435
different ways to measure it.

4
00:00:12,435 --> 00:00:17,308
The CDC defines the food environment
according to four components, the physical

5
00:00:17,308 --> 00:00:21,967
presence of food that affects one's diet,
one's proximity to food stores,

6
00:00:21,967 --> 00:00:25,993
the distribution of food stores
in a particular neighborhood, and

7
00:00:25,993 --> 00:00:31,050
the connected system that
allows access to food.

8
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:34,260
There's a lot of research that shows that
the food environment affects the way we

9
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:38,685
eat, and
our risk of diet related client disease.

10
00:00:38,685 --> 00:00:43,280
There're many different outlets, venues,
and stores where food can be obtained.

11
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,510
The more familiar ones might be
supermarkets, grocery stores, and

12
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:48,122
supercenters.

13
00:00:48,122 --> 00:00:50,350
But there're also farmer's markets and
produce vendors,

14
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:51,700
like the one we saw in the video,

15
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:57,170
and specialty stores like meat markets,
seafood markets, or cheese markets.

16
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:01,520
We also buy food from convenience stores,
drug stores, and liquor stores.

17
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,794
And then, there're places we go that
provide food services, like fast food

18
00:01:05,794 --> 00:01:10,070
restaurants, full service restaurants,
and specific food store venues,

19
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:14,697
like bagel shops, ice cream shops,
donut shops, coffee shops, and juice bars.

20
00:01:14,697 --> 00:01:18,250
Think of how you get from home to school,
or to work.

21
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:22,960
How many different food outlets
do you typically pass by?

22
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,949
How we think about the food environment
can be split into broad categories, such

23
00:01:26,949 --> 00:01:31,191
as the community nutrition environment,
and the consumer nutrition environment.

24
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:35,483
The community nutrition environment
includes the number, type, location, and

25
00:01:35,483 --> 00:01:37,910
accessibility of food outlets.

26
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:40,993
Walking along this street in
this urban area, we see cafes,

27
00:01:40,993 --> 00:01:45,052
full-service restaurants, and perhaps,
some specific food store venues.

28
00:01:45,052 --> 00:01:49,201
Each of these contributes to the community
nutrition environment of the individuals

29
00:01:49,201 --> 00:01:52,060
who live and work in this neighborhood.

30
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:55,470
We, sometimes, measure the community
nutrition environment by the density of

31
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:59,840
food stores, like the density of fast food
outlets, or the density of supermarkets

32
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,340
within a set radius around
a participant's home or work.

33
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:06,830
This can be done through direct
observation, meaning, by walking or

34
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:10,680
driving through neighborhoods, and
recording individual food outlets, or

35
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:14,200
by using commercial or
government business listings.

36
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,680
Here is an example of a study that compare
the food environments in two cities

37
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,120
neighboring Detroit, Warren and Inkster.

38
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,592
Inkster has a population
of about 25,000 residents.

39
00:02:24,592 --> 00:02:26,957
About three in four residents
are African-American.

40
00:02:26,957 --> 00:02:30,870
38% of the population lives below poverty,
and

41
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:34,510
14% of residents don't
have access to a vehicle.

42
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:38,140
Inkster also has a crime rate
that is similar to Detroit.

43
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:42,425
In contrast, Warren has
a population of 134,000 residents.

44
00:02:42,425 --> 00:02:45,510
Only 14% of the residents
are African-American.

45
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:48,995
And 14% of the population
lives below poverty.

46
00:02:48,995 --> 00:02:52,915
Most residents have access to a vehicle,
and the crime rate in Warren is low,

47
00:02:52,915 --> 00:02:55,585
compared to Inkster.

48
00:02:55,585 --> 00:02:57,475
In this figure, grocery stores and

49
00:02:57,475 --> 00:03:00,750
supermarkets are represented
by the black circles.

50
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:04,480
This study shows that Inkster has
lower availability supermarkets and

51
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,400
access to fresh produce and nutritionally
adequate food, compared to Warren.

52
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,450
Furthermore, Inkster had more areas that
were considered low access, meaning,

53
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:17,230
residents would have a hard time accessing
a grocery store if they didn't have a car.

54
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:20,777
This study demonstrates how there
can be disparities in the food

55
00:03:20,777 --> 00:03:23,997
environment by neighborhood
socioeconomic status, and

56
00:03:23,997 --> 00:03:26,571
racial ethnic composition
of the residents.

57
00:03:26,571 --> 00:03:31,516
Which then translates into disparities
in food access, dietary quality, and

58
00:03:31,516 --> 00:03:33,007
chronic disease risk.

59
00:03:33,007 --> 00:03:37,175
In contrast to the community nutrition
environment, which the number and

60
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:38,842
density of various food stores,

61
00:03:38,842 --> 00:03:43,220
the consumer nutrition environment
focuses on what's inside of the store.

62
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:48,510
More specifically, the availability, cost
and quality of food and beverage products.

63
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:52,400
A typical grocery store can have
tens of thousands of items.

64
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,440
In addition to the number and

65
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:57,200
variety of items, there are a lot of
factors within a grocery store that can

66
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:02,070
influence our food purchases, and
subsequently, our dietary intake.

67
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:04,883
But how do we measure the consumer
new food environment?

68
00:04:04,883 --> 00:04:07,150
Well, there are many different
measures that have been developed.

69
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:11,650
One of the more commonly used ones is a
nutrition environment measurement survey,

70
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:13,760
called NEMS for short.

71
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:19,320
This study describes the development and
evaluation of the NEMS-S store measure.

72
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,090
The NEMS store tool assesses
the availability and

73
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:26,650
prices of various healthy and unhealthy
foods, including milk, fruits and

74
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:30,790
vegetables, ground beef, hotdogs,
frozen dinners, sodas and

75
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:35,375
juices, wholegrain breads,
baked goods, chips, and cereals.

76
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:39,950
Going back to the Inkster and Warren
study, the authors uses NEMS Store tool to

77
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:45,170
assess the pricing of specific foods
in grocery stores and supermarkets.

78
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:48,530
From this table,
we can see how the prices of some foods,

79
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:53,190
like skim milk, oranges, carrots,
cucumbers, and cabbage, were marginally

80
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:58,950
more expensive in supermarkets
in Inkster compared to Warren.

81
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:02,638
While other foods, like tomatoes,
celery, and regular ground beef,

82
00:05:02,638 --> 00:05:06,121
were marginally cheaper.

83
00:05:06,121 --> 00:05:09,604
There's also a version of the NEMS tool
to assess the nutrition environment in

84
00:05:09,604 --> 00:05:10,900
restaurants.

85
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:14,980
This look at the helpfulness of main
dish choices, availability of fruits and

86
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:19,360
vegetables, whole grain breads,
beverages, children's menus, signage and

87
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,900
promotion, and facilitators,
and barriers to healthy eating.

88
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,401
In addition to grocery stores and
restaurants,

89
00:05:26,401 --> 00:05:30,130
there are NEMS tools that assess
corner stores, and vending machines.

90
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:33,260
There are also other ways that we can
measure how the food environment relates

91
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,840
to health outcomes.

92
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:39,198
One of these is food prominence, or food
placement, basically, looking at how much

93
00:05:39,198 --> 00:05:43,021
shelf space in a store is assigned to
different food or beverage products.

94
00:05:43,021 --> 00:05:47,036
This method suggest that the more
prominent a product is given in a store,

95
00:05:47,036 --> 00:05:49,319
the more likely the consumer will buy it.

96
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:53,625
There's also food pricing and promotion,
which includes assessing what foods

97
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:57,422
are placed near cash registers,
at eye level, and on floor displays,

98
00:05:57,422 --> 00:06:02,720
as well as in store advertising
used to influence food purchases.

99
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,920
There are also studies that have
looked at vending machines,

100
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:08,970
including the availability of healthy and
unhealthy foods in them, and surveys of

101
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:14,320
who uses vending machines in a particular
location, like a school or a hospital.

102
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:18,462
And finally, there's a use of food sales
data, which can provide information on

103
00:06:18,462 --> 00:06:21,885
the types of foods and beverages
that are purchased by a household,

104
00:06:21,885 --> 00:06:26,047
which can then be examined in relation to
dietary behaviors and health outcomes.

105
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:30,027
For example, the US Department of
Agriculture recently released a study

106
00:06:30,027 --> 00:06:33,879
called the National Household Food
Acquisition and Purchase Survey,

107
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:38,308
also called the FoodAPS, which is the
first nationally representative survey of

108
00:06:38,308 --> 00:06:42,418
American households that collects
information on their food purchases and

109
00:06:42,418 --> 00:06:44,460
acquisitions.

110
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:49,201
This study aims to relate food purchasing
behavior to household factors, like

111
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:54,410
socioeconomic status, food insecurity,
snap participation, and other factors.

112
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:58,044
A number of publications have
already resulted from this data set.

113
00:06:58,044 --> 00:07:01,749
I hope you enjoyed learning about ways
you measure the food environment, and

114
00:07:01,749 --> 00:07:03,972
hope you consider your food environment,
and

115
00:07:03,972 --> 00:07:06,489
the ways in which it may
impact your diet and health.

116
00:07:06,489 --> 00:07:08,428
Thanks for watching.
