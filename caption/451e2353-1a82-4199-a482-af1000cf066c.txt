1
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:02,430
Let's continue.

2
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:19,260
So on Monday, we were discussing the applications of just the different cases of computing, conditional expectation and the probabilities.

3
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:23,280
So the main message is such.

4
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:32,370
So the elementary definition still works in case you haven't explicitly formulated the problem.

5
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:36,479
You have run the variable X, conditional rhythm, variable Y,

6
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,730
and you know you should know how to calculate that conditional expectation or probability.

7
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:48,470
And the additional tools we have now is based on the, the properties we discussed, but.

8
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:55,290
Right. Especially the total expectation law and the power of the filtration law.

9
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:07,649
So the last part of this is how to combine this thing with the sum of the special characteristic of stochastic process

10
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:16,350
and use conditional probability to help us to solve the problem regarding the finite collection of random variables.

11
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:21,820
So we were discussing the example five, the trap line.

12
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,160
I would just briefly recount the problem.

13
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:32,879
So there is a trap, the fly, and it will make independent direction.

14
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:39,360
When it reaches a certain position, one cheat on the fly can make a choice.

15
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:46,530
So the x line, the no eyes choices that the fly makes.

16
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:51,720
So there are three choices they can make error.

17
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:59,340
So if it's exact equal to zero, they choose the door zero.

18
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:04,830
The fly will exit the maze in 2 minutes.

19
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:10,800
And this is where the probability. Um, a third.

20
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:29,160
Similarly, if in true store, one will return to the same point in 3 minutes with probability a third.

21
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:37,290
And then lastly, if they choose, door number two will return.

22
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:46,750
In 5 minutes again with probability.

23
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:53,200
So that's three mutually exclusive choices.

24
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:06,130
Another question is if if we define why is the then.

25
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:19,170
Total time span before that.

26
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:30,150
And the question is, what is expected about it and why?

27
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:38,340
Right. We could actually ask more questions. For example, what is the distribution of why?

28
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:47,260
That's probably more of the fun for question and answer on the why.

29
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,410
But for now, which is we're just interested in the expected value of Y.

30
00:03:52,920 --> 00:04:02,580
Okay. So, so the main point of the discussion on Monday is there is a possibility well,

31
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:14,100
if there is a possibility that this you're going to encounter, that's sort of in finite sequence.

32
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:19,390
Right? So there is a possibility that the fly will never meet.

33
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:29,670
So the possibility is that possibility exists that basically eliminate the way you should you should do enumeration.

34
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:46,800
Right. So this is this is basically you should rule out that they consider this exercise as a potentially as stochastic process.

35
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:53,159
So the Y is building a part of this stochastic process and then we're trying to calculate,

36
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:57,450
so why is the random variability by this stochastic process?

37
00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:02,610
And that's how we calculated Y given that it's a sorry expected value one.

38
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:11,870
So once you make that decision, then the solution should be conditional.

39
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:24,750
If you want to calculate this, y y you can always do is to right.

40
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:32,639
So this is a total expectation loss. So if we can't figure all of the Y given x one, then we'll take another expectation.

41
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:41,010
We get back to the answer we are looking for. So that will give you the mathematical tool we're going to use.

42
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:48,810
Now, what is the benefit of conditional x one? So that's basically to be the first choice of the the fly.

43
00:05:50,010 --> 00:06:00,020
Last time we see we have seen that if you write this function out the expected that if Y given X one now we're going to get this.

44
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:13,240
Let's get to that point. So we're going to right now.

45
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:17,260
Oh, the outcome of this function's right for different x one.

46
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:28,209
If x y equals zero, then the expected and the time is exactly that.

47
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:47,200
2 minutes. Right. So because it's so it's X1 equal to one we set that will be the this particular function will take the value y plus three.

48
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:56,240
So the 3 minutes is the time, spend the flight, get back to the original point and then the problem regenerate itself.

49
00:06:57,090 --> 00:07:06,129
And this is the same problem. So the expected value of from that point on to exit the maze is the same as expected.

50
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:12,370
Value y. Okay. So the important thing, it's maybe a little bit confusing.

51
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:22,330
So well, it could be confusing to someone y, but you should use expected value of y or just run the fair value of y.

52
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:31,000
So this is kind of a confusing point. I don't mean to confuse you, but this is a pretty simple rule to see you need.

53
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:38,780
So you are actually evaluate this function at x one equal to one, right?

54
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:42,560
So that's supposed to the outcome supposed to be a value.

55
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:48,010
Right. So it's not a random variable. So every time you write a random variable, I'll be wrong.

56
00:07:48,490 --> 00:08:00,970
It should be a expected value. And then you can also analyze this from the semantic of the problem, the expected value of Y plus.

57
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:08,680
Right. So this is the expected time. Always the same thing with three additional minutes.

58
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:17,260
All right. So the same thing for X. You still get the expected value of Y plus five.

59
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:26,980
All right. So if you figure all this that all you need to do is put together to calculate the Y using this formula.

60
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:32,080
Right. To expect logical because you already know this one is with probability.

61
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:38,230
So now the expectation is taken with respect to what the outside expectation.

62
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,820
Erica Swan So it's a third, a third on third.

63
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,030
So it's a third with two third.

64
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:51,300
Was this a third with this? Just put everything together.

65
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,210
What we going to get is excited about it. Why?

66
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:00,750
So that's the left hand side of the photo expectation law.

67
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,829
Now we're going to write this three possible outcome.

68
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:10,410
We basically account for the randomness of X one.

69
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:26,610
Yeah. So the outside expectation, the stakeholders respect to X one, a third is two plus a third times UI plus three plus a third.

70
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:33,240
I'm sorry. I see myself as better than you.

71
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:41,550
Plus. All right, so the right hand side is not that right?

72
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:50,700
Give you a number, but put together actually by the equation to solve for the left hand side has the UI right hand side of UI.

73
00:09:51,150 --> 00:10:01,150
It's pretty simple in the equation to solve. And this if you solve for it's one for you.

74
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:04,440
What you want equals ten. So.

75
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:17,670
So what happens is if you invoke this total expectation law and then take advantage of this regenerative feature,

76
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:25,230
sometimes this is called a renewable event or renewable process in stochastic process.

77
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,670
So these equations give rise to.

78
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:35,760
So those those are told expectation loss gave rise to this equation or just simply solve it.

79
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:39,030
Right. Everybody can see this is a simple equation. Right.

80
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:45,210
Two thirds of why you move to the left hand side of that right hand side, it's bunch of numbers.

81
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:55,270
Any question about this? All right.

82
00:10:56,230 --> 00:11:10,580
Final exam, Paul. So generally in this type of.

83
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:14,870
I actually there is one more question. All right.

84
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:21,160
I don't mean to write them, though, sir. So given the fact expected value of Y equals to ten.

85
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:30,120
So I'm trying to ask the question what is the probability that a fly will never exist?

86
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:39,450
That this maze. Yes, please.

87
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:52,860
You don't say something. Zero zero. Why? Because it would be like two thirds tilting like like a very large decimal to highly power.

88
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:55,950
And so that eventually just goes to zero. Yeah, I see.

89
00:11:56,010 --> 00:12:02,970
I'm just trying to interpret what you said. So. Well, you can think about the way you calculate the expected value.

90
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,870
So if you have a non-zero probability on infinity.

91
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,760
Right. So that basically means never exists. The white take the value infinity.

92
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:18,720
If I have non-zero probability of infinity, then this y expected value y must go to infinity.

93
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:27,850
Is that a finite value? The fact it takes finite value that means the probability the fly will never existed equal to zero.

94
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:31,800
So this is sort of the proof by contradiction, at least, right?

95
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:45,360
So this is the same thing. You can also analyze this going back to I think all these argument is every time you return, it's a third.

96
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:52,830
Right. So if I keep doing this, the third raise to the power and the probability also goes to zero.

97
00:12:53,880 --> 00:13:02,080
So that is right. So basically, it's sort of a geometric distribution, sort of a triumph.

98
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:11,550
Right. So that argument is right, too. But there is a simpler argument because the expected value y you go to 2/10.

99
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:19,870
So we're going to use this argument in the of time, especially the property of carbon of change generally.

100
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:27,100
This is sort of, I say, unpersuasive before the possibility and then the probability are all the same thing.

101
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:32,370
Clarity. There is a possibility, but there's the possibility is always a probability.

102
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:35,399
Zero. Right. All of such things.

103
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:41,460
A metric is possible with a probability zero.

104
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:50,110
All right, let's move on to the next so the next sequester and trying to illustrate a different

105
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:59,620
aspect of doing calculation in actually using this is sort of a total expectation.

106
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:07,420
So sometimes it's is it's not a fix or what you've got a condition on.

107
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:16,100
So in the gambler's room problem and the trap, the flight problem, it seems like we're always conditioned on the first, the choice the first.

108
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:23,370
All right, on. It's not always the case.

109
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:32,960
So mathematically, you can always do that. But the point is that's helpful, right?

110
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:36,470
Is that helpful in terms of solving the overall problem?

111
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:41,040
So the the next type of the problem is, again, itself.

112
00:14:43,360 --> 00:15:01,309
It's a frequently asked of problem in sort of a probability interviews or interview or some sort of one sentence quantitative job.

113
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:07,670
They expect to have some probability of training, some this is sort of a type of the problem of Eros.

114
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:14,660
So the example, sex, final example in talk is called a winning streak.

115
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:27,110
All right. So well, this is pretty simple. We're going to toss a coin.

116
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:42,739
So we call the the winning streak is a pause call saying, hey, has been there.

117
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:48,050
All right. I can define chaos so well.

118
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:51,530
So well. I mean, that that's your winning streak for you.

119
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:56,720
Win something if your client calls and has in the role.

120
00:15:57,170 --> 00:16:03,000
So you start doing these things when you when you get a tail, you need to start over.

121
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:06,589
It doesn't count anymore. So the point of this, it was start.

122
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:12,500
You count number one, number two, number three. And then the number of trials you can achieve.

123
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:20,480
So the number of trials well, the number of calls that passes you you achieve K has in the role.

124
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:25,850
It's a random number. Right. Especially one case large.

125
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:29,990
You can imagine the number of this require is going to be large, too.

126
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:38,930
Right. And then the question is asked for what is the expected number of tosses to achieve the winning streak?

127
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:46,480
Okay. Okay.

128
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:50,130
I should say with a p coin.

129
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,730
So the p coin is with a probability. P it turns all.

130
00:16:57,030 --> 00:17:00,390
Turns out as I had. So I may be biased.

131
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:15,200
So if equal to one, that means every time or a close to one, then the answer supposed to be is convergence to K, right?

132
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:22,040
So it's every time you toss a coin, a coin always turn off.

133
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:25,970
Turns out that's. Then you only need the p.

134
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:30,080
Sorry. You only needed k tosses to achieve that.

135
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:34,820
But if the t goes to zero, then that's supposed to be infinity.

136
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:43,180
But in general, we want to find that. Observe that. So let's define.

137
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:53,660
Okay. So the number of policies to achieve.

138
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:10,220
All right. So the question is this.

139
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:19,570
And then. Sorry. That. That's not the question. The question is, what is the expected value of on.

140
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,390
All right. So this is known as a renewal process.

141
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:44,280
And you also cannot really enumerate all possibilities because there is well, there is a possibility as well that you can take the battery infinity,

142
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:51,600
at least in the support network at the controls, and you'll always flip a coin.

143
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:59,970
So how do we deal with this? Again, this one, you can all enumerate that.

144
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:05,660
The logical solution is trying to conditional something.

145
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:14,989
Right. So the the difference between this problem and the problem we have discussed like trap the fly

146
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:29,990
and then the the gamblers drawn is is that helpful to shoot let's say the the the X point.

147
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:36,410
Right. So this is a kind of we have done this this is basically X one is the.

148
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:50,980
They all come off the first the coin toss. So mathematically, there's nothing wrong.

149
00:19:51,490 --> 00:20:03,490
But if you go this broad, I'm also not saying this is a you cannot solve the problem, but it's probably going to be more complicated.

150
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,680
It's not straightforward how you break down the problem. Right.

151
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:16,659
So you can think about this way. Once you if your conditional first, if it's already a tail, then that's the next thing that you need to restart.

152
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:23,890
The whole thing is probably one plus expect the value of an okay right so that expected number of thought.

153
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:32,400
But if you had a had. Then the next thing is unclear because there's too many branches.

154
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:40,400
Right. So it's not saying you the next I expect the evaluated has to be an okay minus one.

155
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:52,980
You just it's not that simple. You either give 5ak minus one successes had pauses or the things, and you need two branches more and more.

156
00:20:53,550 --> 00:21:02,280
So if you're conditional x one, you don't necessarily simplify the problem.

157
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:09,840
Okay. So it's not saying it's again, this is not saying it's wrong, but it's just not very helpful.

158
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:16,800
Instead, you could conditional on something differently in this case.

159
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:25,440
The helpful case is conditional. So what this means?

160
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:34,830
So you get to a critical point. You already get K minus one has in the role.

161
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:43,430
So that's unkind minus one. So no, if you're trying to get K in a row, you have to first look at K minus one in a row.

162
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:47,430
That's you know, that's pretty obvious. Okay.

163
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:54,870
And then so the easier conditional on the number of passes to get K minus one in that role,

164
00:21:55,410 --> 00:22:02,700
then the problem can be, you know, the remaining situation or the plausible situation can be enumerated.

165
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:09,060
Right. Why? Because it's all depends on the next toss.

166
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:16,440
Right. So if the next calls, you get another had you are done.

167
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:23,550
Right. So this essentially the answer would be the expected value of K and payment is one.

168
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:34,800
It's got to be. So you're conditioned on this. So this one is a number.

169
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:40,440
Keep that in mind. So always this. This is also on my mind, the game.

170
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:45,599
So it's okay. Minus one plus one with probability.

171
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,190
P right. So the next houses ahead.

172
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:53,370
You done so with K, you are ready to play.

173
00:22:53,850 --> 00:23:03,120
Okay, minus one, whatever that number is, plus one that you are done right if you're already extremely unlucky.

174
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:06,200
Well, it's just by chance you get the tail.

175
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:13,680
What's what gonna happen? So you need to account for the tasks you already executed.

176
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:17,670
So you have to execute. It is okay. Minus one plus one.

177
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:24,390
So that's the one is the one give you the tail and then the problem regenerate itself

178
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:31,260
because essentially you have done nothing despite of k minus Y in there all your CO,

179
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:34,889
it's a cane or all, so you need to restart the whole process again.

180
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:42,420
So I would say, okay, with probability.

181
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:48,210
Q Right. So this is a particular tricky issue.

182
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:52,830
Here is now you check this to the left hand side,

183
00:23:52,830 --> 00:24:02,790
suppose to be a number because we evaluated because you need the trait and k minus one as a number you conditional not so you got a number plus one.

184
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:06,510
So this is okay. And then this one maybe a bit confusing.

185
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:10,240
So okay, minus one plus expected value of here.

186
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:19,740
Okay, here and sorted out. Think about this after the clause is the very important one you need to put down

187
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:26,190
the so seemingly a random variable here plus the random variable your conditional.

188
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:32,580
Why are you looking to put out put down the expected values but that's the logic.

189
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:45,599
So this situation if your conditional on the right thing there are the the two branches you can enumerate and then that's pretty simple this

190
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:55,620
is a very different than your conditional the first right the coin toss if your condition on the first coin tells you this part is pretty,

191
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:08,130
you know, if you get a tail that branch it's pretty easy to write what is the expected value is also just one plus E and K expected value.

192
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:18,180
But it's really hard to find all the conditional expectation for if I actually get a had the first part think about that.

193
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:25,440
So but not again, I'm not completely saying it's impossible because mathematically is it is possible.

194
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:34,560
Mathematical rule says it's possible, but it's just from a practical point of view that is not straight as straightforward as this.

195
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:40,220
Okay. So now with this. We can do this.

196
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:44,960
The straightforward calculation we're going to fold the total expectation of.

197
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:51,620
Okay. It's gonna be okay.

198
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:57,440
Sorry. Whatever it is. Okay.

199
00:25:57,470 --> 00:26:01,960
Condition off. Minus one. Right.

200
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:07,780
I'm allowed to do this. Right. And then we just need to plug in what we have there.

201
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:22,200
All right. So with probability p, the the value is remember, this is taken with respect to the.

202
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:36,030
Okay. Okay. Minus one. Sorry. So you're going to get any EPA minus one plus one, right?

203
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:40,930
So this expectation is come from the alternate expectation, right?

204
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:45,160
So let's turn that by minus one to E.

205
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:55,030
Sorry, to the minus one to the expected value one K minus one because of the here and those plus q.

206
00:26:56,540 --> 00:27:05,300
I'm like, man. Hey. Minus one plus one plus, you know.

207
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:12,250
Right. So they expected value.

208
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:22,690
Okay, it's a number, if you all prefer a expected expectation operation with respect and okay minus one doesn't change a thing.

209
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:26,230
It's just treated as a constant. All right.

210
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:29,530
When you click terms again, you got a equation.

211
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:34,750
But this time it's not the equation you can solve directly.

212
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:39,490
And you'll get a sequence of equation, rather.

213
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:53,550
Everything is. All right.

214
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:59,550
So it's not clear any questions about this.

215
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:25,530
So if you combine terms, do a little bit of algebra, we're going to obtain this equation with probability and depending.

216
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:36,020
Equals one plus and minus one, right?

217
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:43,400
So this is a pretty much like the number of school problems, you're going to have a bunch of equations so you can write those.

218
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:54,889
So now I'm in a change probability and minus one plus and so on, so forth.

219
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:58,370
I think the case is really arbitrary.

220
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:04,760
You can't write a bunch of equation. So in this case the boundary condition is very important.

221
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:11,300
So what is the probability? You want.

222
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:23,719
I'm going to claim this as one or more of you and I.

223
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:29,900
You should know why. Right. So this is basically the geometric distribution, right?

224
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:39,740
So you wait for the first fail or the first success or the number of the expected value of the coin toss to achieve the first one.

225
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:44,240
That means the first. Right, the success. All right.

226
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:56,240
So you have let's see, you're going to have K equations and then you have so the K accretions anything to have k different variables.

227
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:03,290
So that's a linear system you should be able to solve. And uh, it's actually not very hard to solve.

228
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:14,210
I think you could try it just from here, try to figure out in two sets go up and I do do that by inductive matter.

229
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:19,660
So at the end of the day in K you can figure out and then.

230
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:34,210
So let me just do this. So you get to this one plus one over he right?

231
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:49,120
Because I'm one this one nobody and this one applies to square one over here.

232
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:57,630
So then you can work on the E and three and then you get four. So the general form you're going to get the separation of.

233
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,960
I want you to take one over pi.

234
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:14,450
Right? That's right.

235
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:23,100
So you can work this thing off and then find the pattern and you can prove this pattern by induction or,

236
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:29,840
you know, most cases you don't really need to solve this, but that will be the answer.

237
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:37,370
So this is a pretty well known problem if you have studied the renewal process.

238
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:44,570
Right. So in the renewal process, we don't just work on this winging straight up in that role.

239
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:49,210
They may give you a different pattern, like three hands followed by two tails,

240
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:53,470
or one might expect that the number of passes you're going to get passed.

241
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:59,570
So all these has sort of well, at the end of the day, there are certain formulas,

242
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:06,050
but those formulas can be derived in a similar pattern, a similar fashion, as we have done here.

243
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:14,390
But the really the the story here is what are you conditional?

244
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:18,610
So the math doesn't really tell you what a conditional.

245
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:21,740
Right? Basically tell you what the total expectation law is.

246
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:27,020
You can you can do a conditional expectation on anything and then you can get the right result.

247
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:32,030
What exactly you in a conditional is context dependent?

248
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:37,610
Right. Just like anything in statistics, you have the general probability.

249
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:43,370
How do you apply? These are context dependent. In this particular case,

250
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:53,870
there is one particular random variable you want to a conditional right or the situation you want a conditional that will benefit you a lot,

251
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:57,350
much, and give you a solution much, much more quickly.

252
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:02,790
That will be the conditional. Okay. Minus one. Okay.

253
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:07,870
Questions? Comment other way to say this.

254
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:11,810
This is no fixing. No, there is no fixed rule.

255
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:19,840
What you're going to be what you want to condition on. So that makes some of these probability problem extremely challenging.

256
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:27,310
Right. So if you are lucky in that you can have a really hard, challenging problem, you can know what to condition wrong.

257
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:32,960
Then your solve problems like in 5 minutes. If you're working on the wrong run, the variable is not wrong.

258
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:45,080
Functions is time consuming. Now, say, I'm gonna talk to you this way, but I'm set.

259
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:49,770
Well, I mean, so because a process can be very, very challenging.

260
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:55,939
I think you heard a lot of horror stories about people who got all the from

261
00:33:55,940 --> 00:34:02,059
probability test exams and then feel like crap because so the total of 100,

262
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:06,110
they get like single digits. It's really not their fault.

263
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:12,710
They do some of the times that, you know, this is sometimes I feel like a trick.

264
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:14,780
It is sometimes it is.

265
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:26,800
So like this type of the problem if you've never seen this is like a trick and I'm not going to do that to you, but it's a problem.

266
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:32,500
It's. Yes.

267
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:39,670
Actually, I think the exception condition should be clause E and what this one, you want the expected value?

268
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:48,700
I think the term should be even a lot because you only have one with only one more vote on this one.

269
00:34:49,930 --> 00:34:52,209
So definitely so this one you kind of tale.

270
00:34:52,210 --> 00:35:04,480
So what's going to happen is for example we are as two K go to form so you're right you get three had I know you got a table.

271
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:08,710
This is not the one you need to restart the whole thing.

272
00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:17,300
What you did in previous files. It's meaningless to come to the the end of the game.

273
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:22,070
So you need to restart everything. So if you get h, it doesn't come.

274
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:28,250
Because you don't get in a four in a row and you get four in a row.

275
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:34,670
So. So you need a restart. Maybe you got to go back with that.

276
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:41,130
Got it. Good. Yeah.

277
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:49,560
So the key thing is the pattern has to be exact. All right.

278
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:59,520
So. So we're almost ready to get to the stochastic process, but we still, in this stage of the tool building,

279
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:08,440
the next tools we going to discuss are generating functions and then the convolutions.

280
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:18,240
So so these are not very, very critical material.

281
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:29,160
And then some what you should learn from other courses is just convenient in some of the applications we're going to deal with.

282
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,830
So we're going to spend the lecture to talk about this.

283
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:37,340
So there's a lecture for we're going to talk about talk about convolution and then generating function.

284
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:43,580
And this is really about for most of the relevant thing is the terminology.

285
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:50,570
When we say, you know what I'm referring to, I'm not generating the function, that's often the case.

286
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:55,110
So first of all, we talk about convolution.

287
00:36:57,150 --> 00:37:00,420
So convolution is not a problem list. It's not a problem.

288
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:07,319
It's it's not a problem from a relative term or an alteration in probability theory is

289
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:13,100
actually used in generally the mathematical operation dealing with in finite sequence.

290
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:24,540
Right. So we're going to first to write the definition. So it's defined as a operation to unify that sequence.

291
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:46,420
So the convolution of the two sequences is a90.

292
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:56,320
So this is a 116 finite sequence. And B, I think I have a zero.

293
00:37:56,620 --> 00:38:01,180
So the is a new sequence.

294
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:25,960
We're going to call it CGI. So the case element of C of K, so the case element.

295
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:34,440
So the see the sequence. See the new sequences, the defined through the yeah, the sequence and the sequence.

296
00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:47,470
B in such a way. C of k equal to 0ka i.e. the high minus.

297
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:54,460
All right. So, so it going to be a bunch of products.

298
00:38:55,630 --> 00:39:04,540
So group of products from the to sequence. So the rule where's you're going to break down this is this is a K sequence.

299
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:09,969
Now you can find all combinations of I am and K minus nine, right?

300
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:19,090
If K's 51051423324150.

301
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:23,320
So you need to find all of these combination and then compute the.

302
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:28,090
So you find the pairs, multiply them together and then.

303
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:32,080
And then compute the sum. That's it.

304
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:35,580
So this is actually the algebra is pretty clear.

305
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:45,790
So this is always the way to break down integer k and O possible way you can break down integer K and then collapse the product.

306
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:52,870
So that's called the convolution. So basically trying to match the two sequences together.

307
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:56,950
And there is a notation for this.

308
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:04,230
As I said, this is a mostly in terminology. I'm a notation of I.

309
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:09,250
So this sequence is a convolution ii.

310
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:14,950
We use the star to the end of the convolution operation.

311
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:22,880
Right? So we see this type of thing very often is in probability.

312
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:33,760
So that's why we, we talk about this, especially when we talk about this great random variable so that independent, discrete, random variables.

313
00:40:35,320 --> 00:41:01,120
So the usage. So this is nothing new on the song of two independent non negative has to be not negative no integer right.

314
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:05,200
So those are all of these constraints on.

315
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:14,240
Random variables. Right.

316
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:23,120
So a few days ago, we talked about two independent person definitely fall into this category.

317
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:32,120
Right. So how we calculate the probability mass function now that's a new random variable defined by the true independent person.

318
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:37,490
So that would be the sum of two independent and negative integer random variables.

319
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:51,139
So in this case, in this particular case, you can define the two component random variables as a K,

320
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:54,500
the II, and then by their their probability mass function.

321
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:57,200
Sorry, I should say so the probability.

322
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:22,290
Acts equal to I is a I so the high is the zero one to the probability me y you could write the I and i01 I'm not in this setting.

323
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:27,419
How you calculate you should be able to find the third one.

324
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:42,350
The Pirate Boss. The sum of two x on one. How do we calculate the probability mass function of the sun?

325
00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:59,060
So you see the convolution arise from this type of the situation.

326
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:07,810
That's probability X plus Y, let's say, equal to Al Gore.

327
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:28,810
And then the way this is calculated is we need to break down all of the cases 54202 an exercise.

328
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:40,630
I guess I'm. Why I'm a minus five, right?

329
00:43:41,490 --> 00:43:49,550
It has to be this. Well, I mean, just break down. The whole thing of this is just trying to show, well, if you do this, you get the convolution.

330
00:43:50,510 --> 00:43:54,080
And then that's pretty straightforward because all these things are mutual.

331
00:43:54,470 --> 00:43:58,310
All these events are mutually exclusive.

332
00:43:58,790 --> 00:44:03,390
So by the probability rule.

333
00:44:03,410 --> 00:44:07,430
So the union of these is the summation of the individual event?

334
00:44:07,550 --> 00:44:10,940
Yes. So I do X and Y have subscripts on them.

335
00:44:12,110 --> 00:44:16,900
Oh, sorry. X, you're right. Okay.

336
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:20,900
But for some reason, I think that is.

337
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:25,180
Thank you. So this.

338
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:29,160
Suppose so. So these argue they are mutually exclusive.

339
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:41,569
That's pretty straightforward to see that. So that's the summation of the probability of individual zero and X on the right.

340
00:44:41,570 --> 00:44:47,840
Sorry. So that's on the side.

341
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:58,370
And the next. So you're going to use the independence relationship between X and I and then factor this joint probability into the two.

342
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:07,890
So in okay. Probability takes on the probability of what?

343
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:20,150
A minus sign. Kind of a high note mind.

344
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:27,030
I thought we can call this CEO here. So see the CEO.

345
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:33,739
That's right. So X plus y defines a new run, the variable.

346
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:44,569
So the probability mass function going to be the convolution of the two component random variables and assigns.

347
00:45:44,570 --> 00:45:50,389
They are independent, not negative integer values, random variable.

348
00:45:50,390 --> 00:45:57,590
So that will be a conclusion is kind of a trivial result at this point.

349
00:45:58,010 --> 00:46:01,129
So there is actually a zero in the lecture.

350
00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:05,150
I don't think it deserves their own price anyway.

351
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:14,090
I'm not writing it, but just basically say that the probability of mass function of the sum of two independent non-negative

352
00:46:14,090 --> 00:46:23,060
integer part of random random variables is the convolution of their probability mass functions.

353
00:46:25,370 --> 00:46:33,649
And if you got to do this to two, you could do this to even more random variable, right?

354
00:46:33,650 --> 00:46:38,570
So the way is do that interactively, you can first compute.

355
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:40,909
So if there is a z, read the variables,

356
00:46:40,910 --> 00:46:50,470
the ozone independent who acts on y and then so you can first to calculate x plus y and a treat as the C and then calculate the Z.

357
00:46:50,510 --> 00:46:56,540
So there is actually a corollary the probability mass function of an independent.

358
00:46:56,840 --> 00:47:00,559
Well, I should use a different non negative integer about it.

359
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:12,380
Random variable is a convolution of therapy and that's actually there's nothing really worth discussing there.

360
00:47:13,070 --> 00:47:16,070
It's just you this type of situation arise.

361
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:18,710
We're going to use the terminology convolution.

362
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:30,380
Okay there is so from here it's pretty obvious from the definition of the convolution we always talk about,

363
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:41,000
you know, the properties of the convolution follows the community commutative law in the sense.

364
00:47:56,300 --> 00:48:11,300
In the sense if you compute convolution API RBI is the same thing to compute that the API.

365
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:16,040
Right. That's pretty obvious from the definitions. Right.

366
00:48:16,650 --> 00:48:20,660
So there are also.

367
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:27,550
So this is a community pool.

368
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:47,510
Obviously, there is also an associated floor. So the associated floor, if you do use convolution to do algebra of operation, it's a very useful thing.

369
00:48:48,020 --> 00:48:51,950
So you can do it. That's what I'm talking about.

370
00:48:52,370 --> 00:49:01,100
It's talking about how you actually compute the sum of three independent non-negative integer rather than random variables.

371
00:49:04,910 --> 00:49:14,569
This one you first exclude the first two and then the last one will have the same

372
00:49:14,570 --> 00:49:22,040
result if you do the loss first and then come out with them with the first one,

373
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:26,260
it's all right around the place.

374
00:49:32,930 --> 00:49:38,570
So the associative one just mentioned.

375
00:49:39,530 --> 00:49:49,160
So the convolution also not constrained in the discrete random variables, not just integer values.

376
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:57,080
You could actually extend this a convolution the general concept extend to continuous or under the variables.

377
00:49:57,620 --> 00:50:04,250
So. So that's going gonna be beyond the the sequence.

378
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:11,080
Right. So if your computer. Too independent.

379
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:18,600
Real values. So this going to be a ten X plus Y, you know?

380
00:50:19,990 --> 00:50:26,990
It's going to be something that affects us.

381
00:50:28,730 --> 00:50:33,310
Why? Z.

382
00:50:35,070 --> 00:50:48,060
So this is the value of the Z. So we can come from x, the density x take value as the variable Y, Z minus S and the yes.

383
00:50:49,110 --> 00:50:58,559
Just yes. So this is a kind of a generalization of convolution of all we can see.

384
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:07,080
There are two independent random variables. If I got rid of the integer value kind of string, get rid of the non-negative constraint.

385
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:11,280
You still have this result. It's not surprising.

386
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:15,450
Again, you can derive from the first principle probability.

387
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:25,100
So sometimes we call this this also convolution. So maybe just.

388
00:51:26,530 --> 00:51:30,230
Yeah. The one comment is this is a purity terminology.

389
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:35,110
Most of the problems we solve, we don't really do any of these operations.

390
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:42,879
We don't have to because the things we're going to talk about next is more efficient than they are conceptually

391
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:50,800
easy and operationally convenient to do so that using generating function instead of using convolution.

392
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:55,570
Um, but you need to know the terminology.

393
00:51:55,980 --> 00:52:04,230
And the last thing is you. Yeah, a lot of applications you heard about either convolution or deconvolution.

394
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:08,760
So those are also related to this, the sign of the concept.

395
00:52:08,770 --> 00:52:17,970
So you make words in genomics, you want to decode things because for example, if you think about the tissues,

396
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:24,280
there are basically multiple different cell types, different cells match them together.

397
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:32,590
And then you take the gene expression of a tissue, you measure different this for a single gene, right?

398
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:37,120
I say before single you mentioned a gene expression in different cell types.

399
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:46,810
What you want to do. So what you call what you observe is a kind of a convolution of gene expression of that gene in different cell types.

400
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:49,690
And then the inference problem usually.

401
00:52:50,200 --> 00:53:01,179
Can you break this whole thing mass down into each individual cell so that call it de convolution or decode sort of operation.

402
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:07,850
So that's related to this. He calls it.

403
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:15,650
Basically, he's just decompose. So the convolution has to composed for things to happen.

404
00:53:18,650 --> 00:53:32,360
All right. So that's one of the mathematical operations going to be used for all the terminology that's useful.

405
00:53:32,690 --> 00:53:40,860
The other one is generating function. Again, the generating function is not just a probability.

406
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:44,240
In consequence of the generating function is really.

407
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:51,920
A powerful thing in many different applications.

408
00:53:53,270 --> 00:54:00,500
Most noticeably, actually income intolerance when you deal with, you know.

409
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:07,900
Potential in finite or very large number of the outcomes.

410
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:12,540
So the basic idea of generating function,

411
00:54:12,550 --> 00:54:18,760
so you already see generating function and moment generating functions and characteristic generating functions.

412
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:24,730
But those are serve particular probabilities purpose.

413
00:54:27,670 --> 00:54:34,150
The general purpose of generating function is just for representation purpose.

414
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:39,819
So if you have a sequence that is really hard to, you know, for example,

415
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:48,760
save into a computer and essentially the sequence is in finite, any number of the storage are not going to be enough, right?

416
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:55,299
So a finite sequence. So the way to do it is either you find the rule recursive rules.

417
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:59,680
How do we get from end to end? Plus one simplifies it.

418
00:55:00,610 --> 00:55:03,850
The other way to do it is a still generating function.

419
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:12,950
You establish some 1 to 1. Mapping from it in finite sequence to a function or in function is easy to say.

420
00:55:13,030 --> 00:55:20,440
So that would be the idea. So the definition of generating function, again, a general one.

421
00:55:20,740 --> 00:55:24,640
It's not just for probability generating function.

422
00:55:26,410 --> 00:55:31,510
For moment generating function is just generating function.

423
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:47,320
Another reading function is again the same as convolution this which is to back to a sequence in finite sequence time.

424
00:55:52,580 --> 00:55:58,910
So the definition here we start with a sequence.

425
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:08,840
The sequence.

426
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:21,580
So this has certain constraints.

427
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:24,870
If you can establish a sequence to a function.

428
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:28,799
Right. So the idea would be establish a relation 1 to 1.

429
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:34,320
Mapping between a sequence to a function is not always you can do that.

430
00:56:34,830 --> 00:56:40,320
So those you should know from the calculations, this is called a convergence.

431
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:54,440
A radius, if there exists, are zero times greater than zero.

432
00:56:54,490 --> 00:57:00,420
And so this is the well, the convergence of radius.

433
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:05,920
So no zero condition are. Convergence really is such that.

434
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:16,090
So we're going to connect the dots on the sequence to a function by the following way.

435
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:20,260
A computer. There are any of us.

436
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:26,590
So this is a function defines through the sequence summation.

437
00:57:28,330 --> 00:57:33,159
I could do zero infinity. We're going to calculate this.

438
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:40,630
This. We're going to turn the sequence into a polynomial function.

439
00:57:41,610 --> 00:57:49,220
Right. So this is going to be I add to the power online.

440
00:57:49,550 --> 00:57:53,420
So now as a function, there is a the variable.

441
00:57:53,480 --> 00:58:00,740
The variable is, as I know your sequence is going to put into position for different orders.

442
00:58:01,130 --> 00:58:13,080
Right. So the intercept is A0 first order A1 second the order A2 corresponding to the yes square.

443
00:58:13,670 --> 00:58:27,320
So you're going to have a polynomial of the series and then this is trying to compute this polynomial function with the in finite terms.

444
00:58:28,190 --> 00:58:33,970
Again, in general, there is no guarantee this is what always converges, right?

445
00:58:33,980 --> 00:58:39,110
So, you know, it's it can blow up for any sequence you can put.

446
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:42,860
Oh, that's probably not quite right. But for.

447
00:58:47,730 --> 00:58:55,050
For sequence, you may find that as values that alpha is not well defined, for example, infinity.

448
00:58:55,650 --> 00:59:01,980
So that's why it's important to establish this convergence relationship.

449
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:06,930
We don't need to worry about this in this course. I will tell you why in a minute.

450
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:14,550
But in general, if you're trying to establish a 1 to 1 mapping between a sequence and a function,

451
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:23,070
now you need to worry about if this function is well defined for any given value, you get the extent.

452
00:59:24,570 --> 00:59:30,780
But if you do have a convergence radius, that means within this condition,

453
00:59:32,130 --> 00:59:41,550
with this within the of the convergence Irenaeus value you get, you get a unique number, right?

454
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:45,840
Anyway, the point is not about the value.

455
00:59:46,380 --> 00:59:52,770
The point is about the sequence now is represented by this function.

456
00:59:54,770 --> 01:00:05,980
Okay. You may say okay, the function still polynomial and if you're trying to keep all of this storage, then it's still hard to.

457
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:14,389
It doesn't really solve the problem. But of all the functions you will see in practice, it doesn't have multiple representations.

458
01:00:14,390 --> 01:00:18,740
Right? All function can be represented by the the polynomial series.

459
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:26,870
Right? Like Taylor expansion of any function, you get the polynomial series, but they are not necessarily presented in this unique way.

460
01:00:26,930 --> 01:00:33,770
This is not the only way to examine those. So in those cases you see the benefit of using generating function.

461
01:00:34,150 --> 01:00:53,570
Okay. So if this condition, if such that this converges for all adds in, that's less than zero.

462
01:00:53,600 --> 01:01:03,560
So this is the convergence radius that as is called, it's the generating function.

463
01:01:07,350 --> 01:01:21,500
It's is the generating function of the sequence.

464
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:46,370
All right. So mathematically speaking, generating function is trying to represent a finite sequence as the coefficient of a polynomial series.

465
01:01:46,370 --> 01:01:50,870
Right. So this is a the polynomial function, I should say.

466
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:59,000
There is the constraint. So this taking this constraint takes care of the convergence issue.

467
01:01:59,390 --> 01:02:07,130
If this function is defined, you need to have the function define if this function is defined for some value of the s.

468
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:12,170
So usually this is as you have this convergence radius constraint,

469
01:02:12,650 --> 01:02:23,000
then what we call the the function is a generating function Y because that a of as has the full information of the sequence.

470
01:02:27,230 --> 01:02:31,580
This is because we do this first.

471
01:02:36,140 --> 01:02:41,730
All right, let's just. So this is a general definition.

472
01:02:41,750 --> 01:02:47,630
We're going to narrow it down to the application we care most.

473
01:02:53,130 --> 01:02:59,140
So X negative.

474
01:03:15,050 --> 01:03:18,370
Run the variable with.

475
01:03:22,010 --> 01:03:31,860
Yeah, right.

476
01:03:31,970 --> 01:03:36,060
So now we have a sequence of peak. Right.

477
01:03:36,100 --> 01:03:47,110
So this is again, we are getting a bit specific focusing on non negative integer value, random variables that you can.

478
01:03:47,470 --> 01:04:16,020
So we can define the probability of generating the function of peak, which is given by G mass summation API.

479
01:04:16,870 --> 01:04:20,019
That's right.

480
01:04:20,020 --> 01:04:25,600
So what we did here just strictly follow the definition of generating function

481
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:34,900
for each pill by we just augment some sort of variable s as to the ionic.

482
01:04:35,260 --> 01:04:37,270
Right. That's what we did.

483
01:04:37,750 --> 01:04:47,050
And then the benefit of doing that is we don't need to worry about the convergence radius because this is dealing with probability.

484
01:04:54,900 --> 01:05:01,070
And know we know if we add up all of the probability from zero to yeah,

485
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:06,510
well this is not really the infinity you're going to get that this is going to be convergent, right?

486
01:05:06,570 --> 01:05:12,450
So it means if you take it as equal to one, you add up all the pie.

487
01:05:14,100 --> 01:05:17,300
The secret of wealth. The divide is not going to be diverted.

488
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:25,890
So you may want to say that always equal to one is not always equal to one, but is less than equal to one.

489
01:05:25,900 --> 01:05:29,010
So I'm gonna say this one.

490
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:36,540
All right. In most cases is equal to one. Only the case.

491
01:05:37,380 --> 01:05:44,250
In some of the cases, in the stochastic process, there is non-zero probability only infinity.

492
01:05:44,850 --> 01:05:51,630
But in that case, it's not strictly equal to one. That's could be result in something strictly less than one.

493
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:56,150
But this is nevertheless. This is true. That means what?

494
01:05:56,160 --> 01:06:05,580
We don't need to worry about the. Convergence radius because that exists one for anything less than one.

495
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:09,490
This whole thing is right.

496
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:17,150
So. So if you're dealing with a probability generating function, you don't really need to worry about it.

497
01:06:19,190 --> 01:06:29,340
So one thing to worry about the function is that the function itself is it's not defined.

498
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:38,660
It's always defined. And the other thing about this is we could rewrite this in a different way in terms of expectation.

499
01:06:38,870 --> 01:06:44,390
Right. So this is API so that all of these values as equal to.

500
01:06:44,930 --> 01:06:48,290
So we can't. Right. Just make it clear.

501
01:06:50,150 --> 01:06:53,750
Zero infinity. P of i.

502
01:06:55,200 --> 01:07:06,630
Let me write the probability as the.

503
01:07:07,430 --> 01:07:10,790
So I claim this one is an expected value.

504
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:23,630
That's two API. So that you say it's just a variable and then this is the value x take and then this is a corresponding probability.

505
01:07:24,050 --> 01:07:28,130
Then this is a expected value as to the I.

506
01:07:29,090 --> 01:07:34,280
Right? So it's not very different than a normal generating function.

507
01:07:34,340 --> 01:07:43,040
So you have an expected value, for example, of the exponential function as to that X.

508
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:48,050
So this one can be also written as expectation.

509
01:07:48,650 --> 01:07:55,370
Right. Because they deal with all possible values of X Factor.

510
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:59,740
So this is a really useful expression as to.

511
01:08:01,340 --> 01:08:06,830
So the G also as is expected of that as.

512
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:15,760
Well, sorry. This is not great. Right acts.

513
01:08:18,460 --> 01:08:23,590
Sorry for the confusion. I should always have my notes. So e to the s to the acts.

514
01:08:23,620 --> 01:08:27,340
That's why it is confusing. Sorry. So this one.

515
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:33,310
Right. So the asterisk to the power of that random variable.

516
01:08:33,580 --> 01:08:38,920
You are computing this random function. X is a random variable that has to have that.

517
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:43,960
X is also a random variable induced and that is the expected value of that.

518
01:08:45,490 --> 01:08:51,190
This becomes critically important to the property we are going to use later on.

519
01:08:51,730 --> 01:08:59,120
For example, in this. Are.

520
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:16,610
So there are few things that we have just discussed here, just to summarize.

521
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:42,350
So first of all, we don't worry about the margins for probability generator function because because the summation here, I, I want infinity.

522
01:09:43,910 --> 01:09:52,880
That's the last one. The reason it's not always equal to one, as I said, depends on if you put the probability of mass on the infinity.

523
01:09:52,910 --> 01:09:56,570
So that can happen on.

524
01:09:58,700 --> 01:10:04,310
This indicates the R0 is actually or equal to one.

525
01:10:04,670 --> 01:10:11,749
We only need the R0 greater than one so we can actually prove the convergence radius for probability.

526
01:10:11,750 --> 01:10:19,460
The generating function is always exist. The other thing what I said is there's the equivalent.

527
01:10:19,550 --> 01:10:30,050
If the accelerating function exists, that becomes the equivalent representation of the of the sequence.

528
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:36,830
So that means if I gave you the give me the function or give me the sequence, I can recover the same information.

529
01:10:37,340 --> 01:10:45,140
So how do we recover the information of the coefficient through the generating function?

530
01:10:45,890 --> 01:10:51,590
Well, what we can do by calculating the derivatives.

531
01:10:53,880 --> 01:11:00,120
That's not really surprising. So this thing looks like Taylor expansion, right?

532
01:11:01,410 --> 01:11:11,010
So recovering a guy from the house, well, you kind of recover that.

533
01:11:11,850 --> 01:11:29,380
So this is this is the way it always works. You could calculate their relative ass and they evaluate as equal to zero.

534
01:11:32,190 --> 01:11:37,050
This one will be equals a factorial.

535
01:11:39,990 --> 01:11:47,320
Right. So this is a pretty straightforward. So the the right hand side is as a polynomial function.

536
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:55,410
Right. If you take the first derivative, then you get the first order to.

537
01:11:57,960 --> 01:12:05,490
You got the first order so the two basically P one as that term into a constant.

538
01:12:05,730 --> 01:12:11,700
Just got the P one and the O the other term bias aside assigning as equal to zero zero.

539
01:12:11,700 --> 01:12:15,210
All the oldest tailing terms basically.

540
01:12:15,300 --> 01:12:20,700
Right. So you only leave with, you only get the the term you want.

541
01:12:20,790 --> 01:12:23,880
That's the first term. But there's an factorial here.

542
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:25,800
But this is pretty obvious.

543
01:12:27,690 --> 01:12:38,490
So this is a deterministic operation to take a derivative and then evaluate the function, the resulting function at the zero you recover from.

544
01:12:40,170 --> 01:12:45,150
Okay. The other thing.

545
01:12:48,690 --> 01:12:53,690
Yeah. Maybe if we talk about why we don't use convolution anymore.

546
01:12:54,090 --> 01:12:59,130
Because this is so much easier. If you're dealing with.

547
01:13:01,100 --> 01:13:11,900
John the reading function. So the conversation is one way dealing with the sum of two independent and non negative integer value from the variable.

548
01:13:18,770 --> 01:13:36,670
So the sum of 200 not negative in which our values.

549
01:13:42,190 --> 01:13:45,310
Random variable at.

550
01:13:47,310 --> 01:13:57,770
All. So you can calculate the generating function, the probability generating function of X plus Y very easily,

551
01:13:57,780 --> 01:14:05,220
because this y equals what is expected of valid s, x plus y.

552
01:14:06,570 --> 01:14:11,160
By definition, there's a rating function definition that's an expected value.

553
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:19,980
As to the random variable we were interested in because of the independence relationship, you've got the ax.

554
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:30,480
So the argument here is as to the ax, it's a random variable as to the Y, it's a random variable because they're independent.

555
01:14:31,380 --> 01:14:42,220
You can actually do the factorization this way that results in the G acts, the parts you want, right?

556
01:14:42,300 --> 01:14:47,880
So in the scale are the scale of generating function, the convolution becomes a product.

557
01:14:48,090 --> 01:14:50,579
So that's pretty neat.

558
01:14:50,580 --> 01:15:05,040
And then you don't really need to deal with all of these, you know, the, the summation and, and you have to do the bookkeeping for the coefficient.

559
01:15:05,460 --> 01:15:10,840
Let's stop here. So the next time, well, first to show why we talk about generating function.

560
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:18,330
Well this is a convenience. It's actually so the example that in the lecture those is actually using a generation

561
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:25,140
generating function to calculate Fibonacci the general term for Fibonacci sequence.

562
01:15:25,470 --> 01:15:31,590
Right. So we all know Fibonacci sequence is a la one one, two, three.

563
01:15:32,460 --> 01:15:40,590
I can do that in your mind. So there's the, the next number is the sum of the previous two numbers.

564
01:15:41,100 --> 01:15:51,989
But the difficulty here is if I ask you so let's say the sequence and so I ask what is a F 10,000, it take you a while to do the calculation.

565
01:15:51,990 --> 01:15:57,480
Right. Well what about ten. I've 100 million.

566
01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:01,950
Take a computer a while to do, but we'll show you a generating function.

567
01:16:01,950 --> 01:16:06,240
You can do it, you can find the general terms for f anything.

568
01:16:06,690 --> 01:16:13,259
Right. So that's pretty neat. It's not it's time, you know, it's not the problem.

569
01:16:13,260 --> 01:16:15,870
It's not solvable. It is time consuming.

570
01:16:15,870 --> 01:16:24,150
But using generating function, you can find a very straightforward, convenient the expression for general terms.

571
01:16:24,870 --> 01:16:27,959
All right. We'll talk about that next Monday. I have office.

572
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:32,850
All right, after this. If you want to ask a question, you could ask me the short question.

573
01:16:32,850 --> 01:16:36,989
Ask me now or I come to my office for my speech.

574
01:16:36,990 --> 01:16:43,260
Tools should also have office all on the right so.
