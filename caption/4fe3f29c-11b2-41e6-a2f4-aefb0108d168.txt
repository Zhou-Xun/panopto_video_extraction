1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,420
I got to go for the first time, so that was good.

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:10,900
Awesome. Yeah. Getting back to you was good.

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:23,040
Yeah. All my siblings came home, which was super nice. Yeah, but I had so much grading to do, so I was like, okay.

4
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:35,250
It was so nice to have some time off. And my big question is coming back.

5
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:47,110
We're driving back to the airport, but I think I don't know why I'm like that's like, yes, let's do this anyway.

6
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:57,650
Yeah, I don't know, I, I don't think I wanted to go.

7
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:11,330
I mean, I, I do get, I don't like just because I.

8
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:21,780
Okay. That's fine. So today's another kind of project Workday.

9
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,750
So the construction that I want you to come of what kind of projects?

10
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:33,710
Let me know if you have any questions. On Wednesday, we'll have a guest speaker of one of our students who's graduating.

11
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:40,139
She'll be talking about Elon Camp. She'll be talking about child health evaluation.

12
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:46,200
And in particular, how do we think about quality of life? There's one reading and a quiz her on Wednesday.

13
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,670
And then next week we have our presentations.

14
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:57,330
So I think if you have any preferences about when you'd like to present when they are Wednesday, let me know.

15
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:06,780
And I know attendance seems to be declining, so I'll send an email to the rest of the group and the rest of the class here.

16
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:13,050
I'd like everyone to be here for both days, Monday and Wednesday, so that you can see each other's presentations.

17
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:21,089
Any questions, gentlemen? Yeah, we're we're going to zoom in our other two group members.

18
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:24,240
Is it okay if we go in a room outside? Okay. Yes.

19
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:28,340
Just come give me a few questions, okay? Yeah.

20
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:34,170
And can we present on the seventh? Sure.

21
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:38,760
Now is the time. And is anyone else have preferences for when they want to?

22
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:45,809
You know, school is the thing actually, Tricia,

23
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:53,940
that she is not available on Monday so could get on the Wednesday and so if you want 60 days everything goes crazy cool.

24
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:19,360
So we have to request for the secretary what you might call the sensitivity student of.

25
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,480
Yeah. Yeah. I did a nice job.

26
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:35,900
All right.

27
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:45,480
Do you want to? Yeah, because I can do that. And if that doesn't work, you just sit in a corner.

28
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:51,380
Yeah. You wanted us to look like we didn't know how many people would be here.

29
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:57,770
Oh, I love you so much.

30
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,200
There's a lot more. How are things going? Oh, good.

31
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:12,670
We're basically we have the on the values was a high and low scenarios for us, to be honest.

32
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:22,790
Is it now? I think good. Only next thing to do is what those two are, what we get the values out and then create the tornado diagrams.

33
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:29,450
And that's what led you to think that was just getting someone else to add the

34
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:33,520
mystery to the PowerPoint because that's like the one thing that is formatting.

35
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:36,800
I'm like, I don't know what to do. How are you doing?

36
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:41,390
I think we're good. When are we going to get the feedback for our model interview?

37
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:45,410
When have you already given us our feedback?

38
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:51,350
And then I said, No, no, let me make sure I've got that.

39
00:04:51,680 --> 00:05:02,430
She goes, Yeah, yeah. Because yeah, I don't yeah, I think you're probably really busy, but what's your question or thought was just um.

40
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:07,069
Oh, thank you. And I just did my headphones.

41
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:11,360
Okay, you guys go back to the final text on one of our computers.

42
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,990
Yeah, yeah.

43
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:26,860
Okay. Do you have any questions here?

44
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:32,959
Oh, yeah. Any questions?

45
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:37,160
Yes. There's really not that much. My whole team is on Zoom right now.

46
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:44,330
Okay. Just so that they can be here, I think why I sent you an email asking about this campaign last week.

47
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:54,080
So I think the question that I really had was about like, if we need to discount the inputs or just the output, that makes sense.

48
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,610
So like we have all of these costs for, you know, different year for different reasons.

49
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:04,759
Do we input start to discount those and then like I would go basically model for every year with the discount.

50
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:10,430
Yeah I just thought it's just like we get like what the, you know,

51
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:26,750
like estimated value would be like that and you inflate them to 2020, which you've done and then you say, okay,

52
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:35,540
they're going to be x number of houses like that in 2022 time it was only discounted,

53
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:42,400
but then at 2023 those will be discounted one year back and then 2024 will be discounted to your year.

54
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:53,400
Okay, so we're gonna be like, I don't know if you can get, um.

55
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:58,670
Oh, yeah. So when we do our sensitivity analysis,

56
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:06,410
we kind of came to this point where we're not really finding other values from different studies about what it's like for you.

57
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:07,910
So is it okay if we just kind of like,

58
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:14,810
take like a percentage and very like kind of like an arbitrary percentage and vary our input values for like 5% up and down,

59
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:16,520
or do we need to find other like what's going on?

60
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:26,329
So we want to use the best information so we find other statements and ranges and use those as kind of balance.

61
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:36,500
Rearranges. That's great, but so on and so on in the study itself and see what you think that's giving you one for.

62
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:47,000
And so I guess it's about how you use your judgment about what you think is a great but might be 5% annually certain about it.

63
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:51,709
I would argue that for a lot of these things we're not certain about them.

64
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:55,070
And so you might use 25% or something like that.

65
00:07:55,940 --> 00:08:00,050
And then also think about where did this study come from?

66
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:04,190
And so this number came from New York. I think we can use that in Detroit.

67
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:10,640
And so you need to show me you're not as sure that that number is going to be exactly the right one.

68
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:20,360
So you might have to use a wider range than you would if you had a number that was specifically a Detroit and to even if it's,

69
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:27,530
you know, from Detroit five years ago. And the composition of how people ride bikes and cars interact with them might have changed.

70
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:33,020
Maybe so. That's all. This is part of the art of this is deciding.

71
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:39,110
What do you think are appropriate ranges? The other thing that I like to think about for the Rangers is think about, oh,

72
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:42,709
you're doing this analysis and presumably you're you're doing this analysis to

73
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:47,510
convince people or give information about whether is a good policy or not.

74
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:51,620
And, I mean, I think you guys all think this is a good policy.

75
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:54,630
And so I would think about it enough.

76
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:02,420
You might even have to convince who might be skeptical and they might have a different sense of what these parameters might be.

77
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,380
You know, when you're using rangers use of parameters where, you know, passive.

78
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:16,910
Well, I really think your parameter might be this difference, and I would use that in your sensitivity analysis so you can say,

79
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:20,630
well, under these unfavorable conditions, is it still cost effective?

80
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:25,790
Okay, Rangers, something since there was anything else right now.

81
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:41,239
Are we good right now, guys? Yeah, to make sure. I think we're going to give you a split decision within the state of fear, so to speak.

82
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:44,290
So, yeah, if you have. Yeah. Yeah.

83
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:53,170
Okay. Yeah, yeah. You know what? You when you guys have any questions in a second?

84
00:09:53,570 --> 00:10:07,300
Yes. Thanks to Steven in our issues so far.

85
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:21,410
Yes. Yeah. But the services they don't we get the services as a package.

86
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:26,960
Yeah. Oh, my God.

87
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:30,560
Absolutely. But it was once. It was.

88
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:35,890
And then when you ask me, I think.

89
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:58,220
When are you sleeping? Over calculated or overestimated between 2% to 9%.

90
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:05,180
That's probably a good idea just to like take some percentage or something, like to change it by a couple hundred dollars.

91
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:23,030
Sure. Sure. To see if we can start somewhere.

92
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:40,840
Weekend. How are you?

93
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:50,240
How are you? Are you? Yeah.

94
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:59,030
It's very quiet here. Great. You want.

95
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:11,620
Oh, I know. I think people should try to interpret the South.

96
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:23,060
Yeah, I don't think it really matters. I think we should wait so she can hear what he says.

97
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:32,559
Okay, so we're going to be rigorous because I like how we how we very much depend on, like, the nature of the variables and how it is in the meantime.

98
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,310
I just created some of the numbers. He sent it to us.

99
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,220
I just think we should do it.

100
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:47,920
In the last six years, I've been searching for you.

101
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:57,880
Oh, yeah? And we're going to present all seven, even that we can do.

102
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:05,750
Yeah. I mean, yeah, like I. I'll click in the exchanges and then, like, they're not making a big impact.

103
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:16,560
We can talk about changing how much preparing. So how is it that you do this kind of stuff?

104
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:24,110
Okay. This practice.

105
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:45,110
I've never. But I do.

106
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:56,600
Okay. I would just.

107
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:03,870
The state. Yeah.

108
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:21,620
I see what you're saying, but can you, like, explain what?

109
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:26,630
What values is the problem with? Do you know?

110
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:41,530
What are we going to do to get. So, Darren, doesn't that me be mindful of.

111
00:14:47,630 --> 00:15:12,380
I'm just. Yes.

112
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:16,860
Yeah, for sure. I think maybe like soccer.

113
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:23,250
So I see. I see what you're saying. So like for the implementation.

114
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:30,660
One person, just briefly, that we have this group of kids.

115
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:36,690
Yeah, I don't have an interest. And that's the only thing.

116
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:46,090
That's actually the only place that we have. That's not something like this is just a single introduction.

117
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,970
Really didn't want to do anything else. Yeah.

118
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:56,000
Yeah. I like the implications of the results. Okay.

119
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,889
And I don't think American cares. She's already added some in discussion too.

120
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:03,040
So I'll just say 210 miles to be converted.

121
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,510
Is that right? It's pretty interesting.

122
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:12,130
Yeah. Discussion. What you doing to delete this?

123
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:23,680
Yeah, just. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But is our decision tree.

124
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:44,430
Let's go out into the open for interpretation of the results.

125
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:53,520
Yeah. That into question. Okay.

126
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,799
Yeah. That's the way it is. Yeah, I'm actually already doing it.

127
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,310
So we don't really because we don't need to like.

128
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:08,550
So we seem like the sun, right? We don't actually need to record for each year.

129
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:13,350
Right. Hardship trials and hard times.

130
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:18,660
And I'm not opposed to the costs. We just. We just need, like, the total cost of all ten years.

131
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:27,810
This is an excellent cause. This challenge from the cars on the street is so cost effective.

132
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:37,940
And so.

133
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:52,560
And case to give you a.

134
00:17:55,150 --> 00:18:02,070
I'm putting. Don't miss.

135
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:18,330
I knew Dawn was here to learn class and the discussion about interpreting the results from his analysis.

136
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:34,230
And if you look at the model document, she just updated it to your videos, actually.

137
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:41,820
But I can relate. You can turn it off by thousand 282.

138
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:47,219
Oh, my gosh. I think the assignment it was 14 years in.

139
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:53,340
The motivation for a class using pre-pregnancy distribution is immature,

140
00:18:53,760 --> 00:19:01,290
but I've held the same insurance and the same doctors for years and yet I'll drop a new one.

141
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:06,000
And you guys have been here for years.

142
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:11,370
What did you guys do? You guys, look what I sent you.

143
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:17,669
Did that looks right to you. Yeah, I know what it's like.

144
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:25,860
So we knew the next steps could be how to use results.

145
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:29,790
More contexts you sort of have.

146
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:45,389
Oh, no, no, because I have to disagree. Yeah, it's like little dialog and it was really tiny, but it's just been big.

147
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:56,910
So this is like your one on the discussion part is if we don't do anything and then the intervention is just concerned with petitions.

148
00:19:56,910 --> 00:20:09,510
And so this is a course that I just updated that is now, you know, the per mile cost two times 210 because it's a pretty nice experience.

149
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:18,550
It's in shared document. I don't know. I just mean like more like not not the numbers are more like the setup.

150
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:23,530
Just the numbers are, right? Yeah. Yeah.

151
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:29,830
We got some [INAUDIBLE] documented to share the screen. Actually structured was ghost.

152
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:35,880
And then it's basically the same for change. Yeah.

153
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:39,730
And then click on each MP 610 project once.

154
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:47,180
So we have like this top once again.

155
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:53,470
I think it's been like I clean,

156
00:20:53,770 --> 00:21:03,260
which I've just got a bit of I do model like it's the democracy that took my house that I did for each of those injuries.

157
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:09,970
Not exactly, you know, but he's from scores of.

158
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:23,890
Yeah. And then the bottom is just if we do we have this and this is what we see services.

159
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:44,350
Yeah. So and his bottom line is just like we did all types of pitch impact at the greatest which the value to the result.

160
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:58,180
But the the first question I have is this so thank you to this so sorry to sort

161
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:06,370
of you said get the base case result was what her best case result was 73,000.

162
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:26,650
And so you said the cost of the program was a big institute and it was this cost of

163
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:33,160
this for the cost of having to cover the cost value of values and nothing there.

164
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:36,819
So a big difference on the numbers.

165
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:46,390
So for the tornado graph, I want to show we can we just think of these and to compare.

166
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:57,379
Yeah, I would I would either leave it out or if you do include it when it's dominant, I would just have to zero and then put an asterisk or something.

167
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:06,459
Just say it. And then and then and then you can also cut off the the right hand side and just stop.

168
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:11,860
It goes up to 600 this year.

169
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:20,649
So sometimes I have something where they have to answer what would be line.

170
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:32,920
And then and this was often just because you want be able to see so far it's just zero to see the difference so right

171
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:39,160
the easiest like you said to just exclude that and I show this now if you exclude it just to make sure you don't

172
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:47,110
get it wrong about right now because that is it is the most important one way that you can use a question one way to

173
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:58,059
make this graph showing I here's what the cost for you is as that cost changer cause I felt that cost is negative.

174
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:02,290
It's it's done right. Oh, good.

175
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:13,690
Thank you. So I would have a graph. The x axis is going to be at that cost and the y axis would be the cost of anything.

176
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:16,730
Oh, oh, okay.

177
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:24,910
And you just have a line and, and I think it's interesting that cost negative in the cost effectiveness ratio is,

178
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:33,430
is negative discount do not mean this is included in a lot of our data, but I don't know if you are.

179
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:38,730
But then and then that can give you a threshold and that cost, if you brought it up, it's good for X.

180
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:46,640
I mean I think if it's an optional thing, we Y with 100,000 Z, it's it's over 200,000.

181
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:53,409
How could you control graph. Because I guess change if something is dominant, that's great.

182
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:59,430
We know that if something cost $600,000 on too expensive, right?

183
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:03,560
So if I want to know precisely what cost is some of the person's.

184
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:09,610
Yeah, yeah. I don't negotiate with me. Oh, did you get off my computer?

185
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:14,380
Those two things together. Yes.

186
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:19,110
Seems inconsistent because this is back to us.

187
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:22,960
Understood. Okay, I have one more question.

188
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:31,720
Yeah. So we're mean in. I made these separate for like the subsequent years after the implementation implementations that

189
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:41,330
150,000 because you know so here going to be highly cost effective and the cost of governance really.

190
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:50,470
So for these actually as I look in 2010, I need also to advise you it's pretty likely to be plastic not per mile, but or something.

191
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:53,550
But you found me. This is one thing.

192
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:59,590
This could make it easier. Although, again, this is a number.

193
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:08,500
I can do it. Some of those other things might make it less cost effective.

194
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:14,800
The second point is for you on hunting.

195
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:26,590
Sorry, I guess I'm self-conscious about my information, so I'm going to say, yeah, it seems like that's a big driver.

196
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:34,660
And then I like this, you know, I have it sounds good.

197
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:41,889
I would literally keep playing myself. I did that because I can do stuff to add to your mind in the comments.

198
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:50,870
We should know who's talking. Yeah, it seems like that service is one of the more important ones that is driving the value of my genetic writing.

199
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,780
So I think that's a good conclusion as well.

200
00:26:53,620 --> 00:27:02,709
And it's just right now it's mainly existing research that we've already used to update the data and update the tree and add to the graphics.

201
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:07,300
But it's interesting that you could make it less than 15,000.

202
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:17,180
Yes, we actually did meet last week a similar message to the White House on average quality,

203
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:25,750
which is that could be much more precision to I guess if you give more information regarding route that.

204
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:34,720
Yeah that's that's what that far as I can give more people the right natural care and then also

205
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:48,670
everybody's the one potential exclusions so it's like a tradeoff in a lot of all companies.

206
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:54,990
I mean, sort of more people tend to be like, you can just look at this guy.

207
00:27:55,720 --> 00:28:00,370
Yeah, I think, you know, we need to add something to discussion topics.

208
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:11,040
Yeah, sure. Yeah. I mean, it's about time and space and yeah.

209
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:18,070
The only way to actually just do this and using it, I mean,

210
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:25,470
obviously going to do something changing and just be like multiple and just put it in these formulas.

211
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:34,100
So this is like which I do native 60 miles from the course in one place to live on.

212
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:44,440
So here in Times Square I had at times 50, it's always start times to the surprise, which for once I was perfectly clear that.

213
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:53,320
So I think besides as I mentioned in my attitude comments.

214
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:58,090
Yeah, yeah. Okay. So it would be to just address that as indication.

215
00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:06,010
Yeah. Yeah, you could. And I think the fact that is a little like discounting right now and to you could introduce occasions and what

216
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:11,690
we think is what percent of people have this overlap and if that were the case you something for players.

217
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:18,180
Yeah yeah I'm going to do this one thing and then going to do. Yes and we think that happens today.

218
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:26,620
You can do anything that you mentioned or you say a serious problem like the one.

219
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:31,809
So futures people should try to understand how many people get a combination of these two things.

220
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:35,950
And what is the exit one.

221
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:54,070
Yeah. Yes. In terms of how this project is hard to cover.

222
00:29:54,580 --> 00:30:04,870
Yeah. I mean I think well speaking and I think if they only need more time is effective, that's about doing it.

223
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:14,980
So even though theoretically they're not using cost effective is nonsense if they're not doing this right now.

224
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:21,980
And so you take well this and you have to acknowledge we think this would increase cost to Medicare, right.

225
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,740
I mean, the initial study said we think this would be.

226
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:32,860
And it is at this point, it's you know, I think that.

227
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,559
It will be used to make your houses.

228
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:46,600
They're not supposed to use cost to to restrict access to something, but you're actually not using costume to restrict access,

229
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:54,610
as you're saying is probably is a worthwhile increase in cost that would be worth spending money allocated to the government.

230
00:30:55,910 --> 00:31:05,200
So I went to California to see those shows and just feel like those are more objective.

231
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:10,520
Thank you for doing. We have to bring this to the Grammys.

232
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:16,870
There's a project for couples treatment in just one day or.

233
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:28,850
The best match. The best result is because we get to have something, so let's get it done.

234
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:34,100
I would also like to add something else you could comment on as you get a results.

235
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:38,280
With that said, I'm 73,000. Still sounds cost effective.

236
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:55,850
If one of you hadn't been there, I would guess that the current reason that these services are not focused on Medicare is historically,

237
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:59,330
you know, 50 years ago, this kind of stuff was not considered.

238
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:06,890
I didn't care what we consider outside to normal standard of physical health care.

239
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:11,390
So historically it hasn't been covered as part of that.

240
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:21,040
I think what you've done here is an outstanding way of advocating for the expansion of back to business.

241
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:29,870
And then I'm starting to actually end up with even a traditional Medicare doesn't cover it.

242
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:37,969
I don't think this would be something that you could advocate like Medicare Advantage to have.

243
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:49,870
This is because I think Medicare benefits from being in traditional Medicare, in Medicare for all is put in place.

244
00:32:49,920 --> 00:33:07,309
But it's not just, you know, the sheet mask, which is great that we all have some friends in the system that you'll get and who's currently occupied.

245
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:11,630
So I can also do my, you know, I don't want to evaluate with them,

246
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:23,250
etc. knowing in terms of the funding separately with 0.0 they wouldn't do that in

247
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:29,500
there might be more prevalent circumstances she said she said well I proposed.

248
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:47,510
Yeah. So I'm just saying because the you're telling me that if somebody said they can get both of them to say yes, this has the other questions.

249
00:33:51,700 --> 00:34:06,920
So how is this going to work for you?

250
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:13,930
It will work. Recording stuff.

251
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:18,370
Okay. We get two more questions. Sure.

252
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:26,229
Yes. My first question is like this is our sensitivity. Do we need to do a sensitivity analysis for like all of these variables?

253
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:31,310
And this is basically everything that we are putting in our model or like should we pick and choose like ones that we can form?

254
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:37,350
Interesting. So the standard answer is yes, you should do this for all parameters and enter the results personally.

255
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:40,720
That's because that helps you figure out which parameters are the most important.

256
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:45,790
Now, you could probably guess some of the outset. Some of these are probably not going to make a big difference.

257
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:52,270
But the way to justify that is to actually plug it in and see what kind of create

258
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:57,159
that tornado diagram and see which parameters do have an impact against the 90%.

259
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:02,440
That probably will not have a huge impact. But the way to show that is to do the analysis.

260
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:10,090
And then that will again, that that helps to if you're trying to convince someone, they say, well, what about parameter number 42?

261
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:13,810
You would say, well, look, it's a it's near the bottom of the tornado. It's not a big deal.

262
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:20,420
Okay. That's helpful, because going to help to justify what should or should not be as the ones you really focus on.

263
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:24,890
So again, you typically do all the all of them to create your tornado criteria.

264
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:29,649
And then you can focus on the top five or something like that or top three or whatever it is,

265
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:33,950
type one, whatever you think is most important, and return that one seed.

266
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:40,300
Okay, this one or these three or these five are the most of parameters that that really are potentially driving.

267
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:46,670
And then you might have just answered your second question, but you're just wondering this like our HQ are scores,

268
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:49,720
scores like it's kind of somewhere we talked about before too.

269
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:52,900
Like we didn't really find like other values that we could plug in.

270
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:56,590
So like, should we include those lessons to analysis to?

271
00:35:56,590 --> 00:36:01,270
And then I think one of them that we looked at had like a standard deviation of 1.1.

272
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:06,700
So we just changed them all by like point one. Is that sure.

273
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:11,660
Yeah. I think point one for utilities is all the results.

274
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:24,010
And you know, I think one of the other things to make or sometimes you you can we were like for the our

275
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:33,339
graph that we chose to do so because our study is as regarding like metastatic pancreatic

276
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:39,940
cancer and seeing what the concept of analysis is regarding the standard of curative care and

277
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:48,190
giving our results for like looking at this stuff is really not too much of a difference.

278
00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:58,780
Yeah. Or between discount on discounted rates for both student care and services that I mean,

279
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:04,150
it's not surprising that your qualities are not very different. I mean, these are people with very serious illnesses.

280
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:08,170
And so they're not they're not expected to live very long.

281
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:12,180
And so you're not going to have 42 colonies or anything like that.

282
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:18,210
Yeah. With this in this patient population. Me.

283
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:28,170
Yeah. Especially in the in the area of kind of in stage cancers and stuff like that.

284
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:33,630
It's not unheard of to see, you know, point seven, 5 to 5 times the average.

285
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:40,620
These are average qualities, right? I mean, some people will die within two months and some people will by ten years later or something like that.

286
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:43,860
And but these are people, these are the average more than two months.

287
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:50,580
Mhm. Yeah. Yeah. We don't have to put in any of these.

288
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:58,650
These are quality adjusted life years and so um, you know, the quality of life is not that high to it,

289
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:02,940
which is part of the reason for the palliative care is hopefully going to improve quality of life a little bit as well.

290
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:13,460
In your in Pittsburgh include all of these.

291
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:21,650
Is there really like you're expecting more?

292
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:25,350
Yeah, I don't I don't know the answer in between the two.

293
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:29,760
I think I think the cost quality's nicer. I think actually it's good.

294
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:34,440
I mean, you can you can you can kind of see on your graphs there the incremental prices,

295
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:39,930
if you wanted to, you could you could present your life your is something people care about that.

296
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:45,750
Oh yeah I think for this that's.

297
00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:58,530
It's fine. Okay. And really the key is saying, okay, I'm thinking between, you know, palliative care, acute care, combination of the two.

298
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:04,499
You know, what is that additional benefit in terms of life expectancy or quality?

299
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:11,520
Just life expectancy? And then what is that incremental cost? How much are we paying for for those extra months at this point?

300
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:22,200
Yeah. And we still that's still to be determined regarding our incremental costs and incremental polys from that.

301
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:29,470
We still have to do that in other news counts, like give me his consecutive.

302
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:34,350
So it looks like the results are about $18,000 per point.

303
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:39,060
Yeah, we just want to keep.

304
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:48,730
Just last week I was complaining about how I'm not used to this, but not too much improvement because of terminal disease.

305
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:59,670
So since it was at 9:30 p.m. though, so late year would be essential, right?

306
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:07,070
So that the curative measure $66,000 and.

307
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:11,290
No, I can't say no. Yeah.

308
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:15,240
Yeah. In between.

309
00:40:15,570 --> 00:40:20,010
I do think it's yeah.

310
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:23,489
I probably wouldn't go actually just to London is probably not a huge difference.

311
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:29,280
Here is a short time frame. You're talking about something you have seven years of interest in.

312
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:38,790
Like the time frame for this is like really short. It's like mostly to a couple of years to five years and $2,000.

313
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:46,200
And I think both the studies that we were looking at lower sense around like 36 months or six months.

314
00:40:46,200 --> 00:41:00,950
And then if we have some other questions that it's just made up that your doctor just so we can split up into mystery English,

315
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:13,120
is this going be hard to get over this time that you just walk to investigate?

316
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:23,710
Because if it is clear, that's exactly what you're saying?

317
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:24,659
I think before we do that,

318
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:34,139
we need to find the reason for our page termination when it is quite convenient with other if you're in the default health status.

319
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:38,900
So systematic reduces patients is easy as zero.

320
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:42,459
But because it's just a formula. Yeah. Have you found anything?

321
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:45,780
You weren't sure about the quality of those conditions?

322
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:50,440
Oh, no, no. That's not how we can. Yeah.

323
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:56,940
So that's one thing to think about is what is your quality of life automatically read in discussions.

324
00:41:57,030 --> 00:42:00,400
I think see this one's like peace of mind and make sure we are updating.

325
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:10,770
We just don't have that kind of data access throughout. I guess I, I and we need to add stuff about like sensitivity analysis over there.

326
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:24,990
So I'm not sure I was able to address as much as I can do like some research regarding teachers employment, like I'm going to excavate some data.

327
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:33,780
I mean, I think there was nothing to do for me know that tells you lot about what we're supposed to fill out.

328
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:43,620
You know this. Yes, I think there is some of to know which was about what is quality like with renal disease because we don't have

329
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:51,570
like if you're thinking about like compare it to like any stage three like the ones below it or this minus this,

330
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:58,020
there's no one above it. Five related complications depending on how severe those are.

331
00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:02,820
Yeah. Like .8.9 seems like.

332
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:08,280
Yeah they are. So basically that's what you're doing is your, is your weight.

333
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:17,280
So here like use them summing up this also assumes. That's right and so why is that we use a weighted average in that like a 1.0 to 1 359

334
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:22,830
or whatever it is times these some people consider what else we want to add a table.

335
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:28,290
So yeah so if you I just think to find something we might struggle with that.

336
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:32,610
Yeah. Just make a reasonable assumption of why you think that it's.

337
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:39,030
Oh yeah. And also yes he's I'll going to get into the model for that.

338
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:44,380
So you get just.

339
00:43:44,610 --> 00:43:48,700
Oh yeah. So if you can, if you the.

340
00:43:49,910 --> 00:43:53,660
It's your judgment as an analyst about what you think is a reasonable range,

341
00:43:54,590 --> 00:44:01,489
and that might be based on data from the study, which I think is sort of the studies on the test.

342
00:44:01,490 --> 00:44:06,220
You can obviously discount is your range here.

343
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:10,890
The one study that gave you a conference environment so you could use that.

344
00:44:12,010 --> 00:44:15,120
But oftentimes you don't have that. So you really do have to use your judgment.

345
00:44:15,330 --> 00:44:28,140
And so anyway, that that first range, though, .39, that's the one I just got a lot of coverage that we decided.

346
00:44:30,690 --> 00:44:34,410
Is it worth you go back to your Markov model. So where are you spending every Wednesday?

347
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:39,180
So you have these rates here, 2.5 points, 1.4. So those are the numbers.

348
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:50,300
For example, you want to vary in the cost associated expense because you should be the same back and the lowest utility values.

349
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:57,929
Does that mean it's not always hard to do this?

350
00:44:57,930 --> 00:45:02,249
There's no right or wrong answer in zero if you want to use a range that would be

351
00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:08,180
plausible for what parameters might be within the range of developing income.

352
00:45:08,190 --> 00:45:13,590
As a result of thinking about the options, I would think about who your audience,

353
00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:22,950
who might be someone who would would do you interested in your analysis and then think about what you can ask them about why

354
00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:31,290
they're like maybe what these contributors might be someone who might be optimistic or pessimistic about treatment or mortality.

355
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:37,830
They might have different beliefs about how many of the disease progressions or progression.

356
00:45:38,010 --> 00:45:38,180
Sorry,

357
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:46,770
do we have a are we just using the slide deck from when we give or what's difficult some what you trying to say and try to think about what I mean.

358
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:52,080
Audience And what does it take to take to right?

359
00:45:52,240 --> 00:46:02,070
Is that one of the first two? And then I can do like the second to try one more question for your team.

360
00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:17,160
We use that 1% of assignments and I haven't in this program to be a better one.

361
00:46:17,550 --> 00:46:27,180
Yeah. And so there were two things and it's okay if it really is like, Oh, and this is my chair.

362
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:33,839
You have been interesting. So do you think these progression parameters are are correct?

363
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:43,140
So here it's saying only 5% per year develop renal disease and they always turn out the other stat that's a 78%.

364
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:47,670
So I think that's all I use. You know, that's one.

365
00:46:47,790 --> 00:46:52,030
Yeah, one thing that's probably driving this is a lot of them are developing.

366
00:46:52,410 --> 00:47:04,130
If you look at the RTI tab again and this one does have a higher chance of cardiac complications due to some of the double sign.

367
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:12,210
I think because more people are developing renal disease in your file, you have to develop renal disease before you got cardiac disease.

368
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:22,350
And so this this rate of renal disease is so much higher, although although the rate of cardiac disease later on is lower,

369
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:30,570
there are so many people developing resources that I think that I think that's probably something we are tuning in again.

370
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:37,380
Yeah, maybe that might be Watson. So I would make sure that you're comfortable with those.

371
00:47:37,670 --> 00:47:47,820
But, but, but that might be an insight that you've developed here is that because so many people are developing disease reduces itself is bad and then

372
00:47:48,590 --> 00:47:57,060
it's pretty widespread so that might be something that's going on is closer and then like turn it off actually for like 30 seconds is good.

373
00:47:57,070 --> 00:48:05,970
I've actually like I'll, I'll start it and talk about this, get more features, the feedback,

374
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:15,690
I mean I've really been there but for the genetic for your your model here as I was

375
00:48:15,690 --> 00:48:24,360
looking at that um I can do like I was using the different types and I am patient

376
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:29,920
and this is the variant that you're looking at kind of things are looking at

377
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:38,130
costs and there and then qualities for the mother and then you will have plans.

378
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:42,190
Yeah. So yeah. So yeah.

379
00:48:42,630 --> 00:48:49,530
I mean I can get you on to the first two and then I can do like this I can to all of your time between

380
00:48:51,600 --> 00:49:01,350
zero like gives this yeah summit that was one thing I would say it's high value versus low value.

381
00:49:01,710 --> 00:49:06,390
Yeah I think is it the high value of like what's the high value. Kind of how.

382
00:49:09,130 --> 00:49:22,230
But the challenge here is, of course, I think I understand 1.4 children is basically nothing for you guys.

383
00:49:22,990 --> 00:49:33,130
So I don't expect to see that. And then they were the ones that were chosen to walk out with the servants.

384
00:49:33,190 --> 00:49:34,720
That's why I'm here this morning.

385
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:42,960
So I think we need to talk about it right now because it was millions and millions of things and for the rest of their lives.

386
00:49:42,970 --> 00:49:47,080
Oh, yeah. I'm sure you saw the energy in that do.

387
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:57,820
I have my my friends are there, but I can see that she had a deal with them.

388
00:49:58,330 --> 00:50:08,030
I know. Right. For someone with an employer, they might be lowered, you know, using, I don't know, adjusting after the people weren't employees.

389
00:50:08,050 --> 00:50:18,110
Is that right? Yes. No, I think each one of you is not that this is going to hurt someone.

390
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:21,860
That generally standard person will be more original. I know. I'm just like one.

391
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:26,870
I just you know, like we stay on these talk about like I think part of the work still is over time.

392
00:50:27,670 --> 00:50:33,160
Yeah, that was a great idea. Yes, that's fine.

393
00:50:33,370 --> 00:50:37,140
I know you did 0 hours like a quarterly presentation.

394
00:50:37,870 --> 00:50:41,110
That got me. This was five years, 3%.

395
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:50,070
Let's check on one of the things it's a little bit fraught in the area of just kind of screening is terms.

396
00:50:51,530 --> 00:50:55,490
So. Oh, yeah. No, I think, I think we can do a lot.

397
00:50:55,530 --> 00:50:59,100
And sometimes I think it was, you know,

398
00:50:59,150 --> 00:51:07,340
images like that when I was really I really can't really remember exactly which was like 10 seconds or something through lunch.

399
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:13,100
The expectation they will get pregnant in the future and have models.

400
00:51:13,150 --> 00:51:18,980
And this is the and at the beginning that person had something like it was the parents of two kids or whatever.

401
00:51:19,370 --> 00:51:27,439
And they're just keep trying until they get to kind of just I don't know if this was the last terminate the pregnancy.

402
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:32,870
There will be another decision in the future. I think that certainly affects entering into that.

403
00:51:32,870 --> 00:51:41,090
They're interested in trying to reinvent and also think about we did include Kansas now because I thought we did.

404
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:45,820
And so mortality rate has been really high. So you have.

405
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:49,180
Yes. So there is this. Oh, we have quality adjusted those. Okay.

406
00:51:49,430 --> 00:51:57,020
Yeah, I think some of them we didn't have drug data, so there was like assumptions made of all of the airport terminal was inflated.

407
00:51:57,020 --> 00:52:00,190
So since then it's probably going to be similar from Trisomy.

408
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:07,480
Yeah. And, and there's one section includes sensitivity analysis of immigrant genes I think really well.

409
00:52:07,850 --> 00:52:12,950
And so she didn't use that's that's obviously not good you're reading for you

410
00:52:12,950 --> 00:52:18,340
by the way what's up with sensitivity sensitivity analysis for the marker,

411
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:24,320
the quality for a mother? That was that always.

412
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:30,650
I mean, I anticipate doing a lot of the work for the results.

413
00:52:31,730 --> 00:52:35,800
Basically the same things we just of just go to the market model.

414
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:39,320
It is I think those are two parameters.

415
00:52:39,530 --> 00:52:46,860
Yeah. They they differ as well. No, that looks like that is one key to that.

416
00:52:46,890 --> 00:52:54,830
So we like it to that. So not that we like to call this all the termination and then we just it's similar across the to say yes versus

417
00:52:54,830 --> 00:53:02,420
to terminate would we change it we just go back with those are included as far as scripts if you yeah so.

418
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:10,180
So if someone has a screen race results or something like that.

419
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:17,580
Yeah. I mean, like one of you could do it and then one of you could do the best for the and do it for one that you think it's fine if you.

420
00:53:17,710 --> 00:53:24,270
And then we can. All the others who want to watch that is device.

421
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:32,470
And then it was like in the future maybe you want to use it like, well, how, how long term?

422
00:53:32,690 --> 00:53:46,600
So that's why it's going be like next like apogee and crash was always great so that to be able to launch like over a year from now,

423
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:50,760
I think this is this is kind of like to do with a link.

424
00:53:51,550 --> 00:53:57,970
Yeah. Yeah. So, yeah. Assuming no terminal complications.

425
00:53:58,450 --> 00:53:59,470
Isn't that what she's asking?

426
00:54:00,910 --> 00:54:10,930
I cannot draw it on your notebook so that we can get an idea, which I think we probably can't do that because we have no idea.

427
00:54:10,930 --> 00:54:21,910
I was just wondering if you consider these some factors to do the things that make sense for having the original submission to your pregnancy loss.

428
00:54:22,950 --> 00:54:30,050
See, yeah, I think, you know, you should probably we should mention that because again, actually, no,

429
00:54:30,190 --> 00:54:42,429
those are I think we can we have to do for someone who was pretty similar situations to that how to lessen the impact of your really

430
00:54:42,430 --> 00:54:56,680
really trying to get on the net but you can't put regulatory capital in that you can't that's much more sensitive than we done by it.

431
00:54:57,470 --> 00:55:03,190
So yeah you know as long time that's good.

432
00:55:03,190 --> 00:55:11,290
And I think you could also if you look at the information on it, can you just remind you our question was arise from the newborn?

433
00:55:11,290 --> 00:55:13,809
I think that's just and that will work in that one.

434
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:22,090
But then put the answers behind showing then we can do it at the same time instead of having to just one of these ways that said,

435
00:55:22,090 --> 00:55:27,700
you know, maybe there's something you have to be having every session,

436
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:36,399
because we really do quite often in newborns where we have to do you should start against the

437
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:45,550
assumption is those you know you're not getting any quality or you're still missing out.

438
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:55,300
Yeah, it is clearly this all the question is so that those qualities, if you will, could be replaced with subsequently.

439
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:10,460
Or I can just let you guys. Maybe that certainly wouldn't someone have another practice in York City.

440
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:25,300
So hopefully I can take some it's a and interesting and basically what we have to just do is go to the purpose that you're exposing here, which is.

441
00:56:30,060 --> 00:56:34,410
So you go. Do you guys have questions for me? I get to know guys and stuff.

442
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:44,100
So first change is just this change, that presentation we're making.

443
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:50,730
So the presentations next week will be here as your kind of final presentation.

444
00:56:51,750 --> 00:56:53,760
Then you will get to feedback,

445
00:56:53,760 --> 00:57:04,620
which you can include in your final report so that the presentation will be graded on like methods presentation present grading on that one.

446
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:10,140
And it's going to be graded based upon how we present the data and discusses

447
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:16,830
and the thoroughness of not necessarily the complete accuracy since the final.

448
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:23,780
Yeah. Even though I'm pretty, I'm not saying that is how I would like results.

449
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:29,489
Yeah. I think presented that we have results. But if they change between next week and the summer.

450
00:57:29,490 --> 00:57:40,710
Yeah, that's fine too. Okay. That's okay. Okay. And then I'd like to see good results that are evaluating these changes and making them better.

451
00:57:41,670 --> 00:57:53,820
That's great. Okay. But if you if you come to professional level that you try to do so, it's like it's like Thursday night and see if we need it.

452
00:57:53,910 --> 00:57:56,980
Otherwise, we'll just be Tuesday. Okay. Thank you.

453
00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:15,410
Okay. So it's just I don't know.

454
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:20,330
Sometimes you just want to see.

455
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:53,830
And so this is this is the first president of the United Nations Security Council and foreign countries and what it means to choose to do this.

456
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:58,540
This might be a better time to run. A better example here for journalists.

457
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:04,020
Here we have something changing, changing, regime changing.

458
00:59:04,950 --> 00:59:11,230
Okay. So this is like a here we have age and the ages, 50% higher or whatever.

459
00:59:12,630 --> 00:59:17,880
Now you don't have to have a percentage change. This is trying to show how to change my charge.

460
00:59:18,450 --> 00:59:30,020
If you could separate costs, I would just have like one percentage change is how you just have what is that as opposed to say that?

461
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:36,320
So what is the net cost? What is the range over which you are looking at?

462
00:59:37,710 --> 00:59:43,010
Yeah, I can. Yeah.

463
00:59:46,600 --> 01:00:03,340
Yeah. And you're. But I mean, you can have $11,000 of savings or $33,000 and probably let me say this.

464
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:10,810
Oh, sorry, 11 billion in savings in three years. So I would I would have zero.

465
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:20,580
Well, we can just start. I would have you know, I would have to X-axis be the, you know, billions of dollars in net costs.

466
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:24,780
And you can start in sort of negative or -11 if you want to.

467
01:00:25,090 --> 01:00:35,249
Oh, that's interesting, though. I think that's basically because your cost effectiveness plane, the cost access is basically just that cost rate.

468
01:00:35,250 --> 01:00:41,459
You're not adding anything to that or you just have to do it is basically you're

469
01:00:41,460 --> 01:00:44,790
just calculating the qualities and then you're using the cost of that stuff.

470
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:52,770
So, so basically if you're if the costs go below zero, you're dominant.

471
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:59,520
And so for me, I don't think it makes it very interesting to zero.

472
01:00:59,910 --> 01:01:02,970
Is it always there? It's always going to be down this period of time.

473
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:11,240
You're on the giraffe section. And so if it's if you're if you have a net cost of $10 billion, what's the cost of education?

474
01:01:11,370 --> 01:01:14,370
Oh, it's 200,000 for quality or whatever.

475
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:20,150
Oh, the training. Yeah. He's actually questioning.

476
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:27,920
We're using the. And so it was that it was different, you know?

477
01:01:28,950 --> 01:01:34,750
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I might I make sure that first I hear you say this was the most important and so on.

478
01:01:34,780 --> 01:01:42,980
Yeah. And then here are all the other ones. Okay. So West Portland was the cost for the state and then also whatever.

479
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:51,739
And then you say and then all the other parameters, these are the ones and it looks like it's important to like specify you get a

480
01:01:51,740 --> 01:01:56,899
lot of money from it also in residential part of the child would only exist

481
01:01:56,900 --> 01:02:00,770
once channels would form and ah and as long as we define that time period and

482
01:02:00,770 --> 01:02:13,549
that was grandma I don't think that's close to being and no that's not it.

483
01:02:13,550 --> 01:02:25,310
It really doesn't. Yeah. We don't calls to say we want to overstate.

484
01:02:25,940 --> 01:02:34,790
How can we. Well I think, I think that paper shows there is a cost to the program and that it might save some money.

485
01:02:34,790 --> 01:02:39,140
But the net cost controls are still in that context, right?

486
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:50,170
Yes, I. So do you think she needs to be introduced?

487
01:02:50,660 --> 01:02:53,290
Yeah. And so I think I think that highlights that,

488
01:02:53,290 --> 01:03:02,020
that other people as an audience and maybe it'd be good for the decision to research to really get a precise estimate of what is that cost.

489
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:07,980
You know, that's a big range. Oh, you're to save 1000000000 hours. It's going to cost you $33 billion.

490
01:03:07,990 --> 01:03:16,000
And that's a big, big range. And it might make it for future research to get a better idea of what kind of what that cost is.

491
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:24,650
Is it negative? You're saving $1 billion. You cost $33 billion just to do some vaccinations.

492
01:03:28,180 --> 01:03:35,860
So the way I think about this is that, yeah, this is your coming couple of questions you can say.

493
01:03:36,810 --> 01:03:41,700
This is a great program and definitely should do it more.

494
01:03:41,940 --> 01:03:47,550
I'd say maybe it's good, maybe it's not. We should do some additional study to find out.

495
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:53,020
Is this a good. I'm guessing you guys are leaning leaning towards.

496
01:03:53,020 --> 01:03:57,730
We think it's a good program. Like, if you wanted to study it some more, maybe you'd want to study cost or.

497
01:03:58,090 --> 01:04:15,610
Or do you think you've study? I hope. Thanks.

498
01:04:29,340 --> 01:04:36,660
So our sensitivity analysis like this is just an example of one place where we're saying this is like we used to of these activities probably.

499
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:40,580
And then another study is 10.5.

500
01:04:40,860 --> 01:04:47,260
The big difference we are getting include that but doesn't have to like vary the same amount above and below.

501
01:04:47,390 --> 01:04:53,390
It can just be two different things. Yeah. I mean if you think it's likely to be low, but it's possible to be really high.

502
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:57,650
Yeah. Okay. Okay. So it's like it's fine to do like 1% and then 10.5%.

503
01:04:57,970 --> 01:05:01,010
Okay. Yeah. That if you think that's. That's reasonable. Yeah.

504
01:05:01,090 --> 01:05:06,900
Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Mm hmm.

505
01:05:10,190 --> 01:05:14,620
I don't know when you.

506
01:05:22,190 --> 01:05:45,780
And because of that, I think things are ready for everyone and put it right here so that you can actually change that.

507
01:05:47,940 --> 01:05:52,040
Because of the significance of this.

508
01:05:54,840 --> 01:06:00,480
But things like said that's a tricky.

509
01:06:10,190 --> 01:06:38,150
Yes. It was probably good to because they were imagining that we would see legislation that would probably just at the same time stand.

510
01:06:38,360 --> 01:06:41,569
So it's like comparing apples to apples.

511
01:06:41,570 --> 01:06:48,410
And I certainly. Oh.

512
01:06:51,610 --> 01:06:55,660
I was trying to think of a way to added something more visual to bring it up.

513
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:09,330
It's like you're. I mean, a question about our sensitivity analysis so far.

514
01:07:11,750 --> 01:07:17,149
So we have all high and low scenarios for things like that.

515
01:07:17,150 --> 01:07:22,670
The youth will become smokers. That is specific to the status quo syndrome.

516
01:07:22,730 --> 01:07:26,900
So we were thinking we're only change in our status quo.

517
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:39,800
We want to and then look at the overall change the study and then look at how the ICER comes out with something like the quality of like smoking weed.

518
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:45,710
We usually go with this, you need to monitor levels and then change them.

519
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:48,710
I think it's a high value. Yes.

520
01:07:48,980 --> 01:07:57,710
And so what I would do to help you with this is I would read and I think you already have this here is this is linked to Primary B6.

521
01:07:58,190 --> 01:08:04,309
And so I want to be able to change the parameter in one place like the parameters

522
01:08:04,310 --> 01:08:09,380
worksheet and have it up to either just one or both of the spreadsheets at the same time.

523
01:08:09,620 --> 01:08:13,100
Yeah. I'll give you the, you know. Okay.

524
01:08:13,130 --> 01:08:17,360
Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah. Thanks. Yeah. Palliative care would have a higher mortality rate.

525
01:08:34,650 --> 01:08:40,530
I was so angry with you.

526
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:48,090
I thought that you gave us a contract, which was time sensitive.

527
01:08:52,600 --> 01:09:02,190
I mean, we should do it.

528
01:09:02,380 --> 01:09:08,870
Says something about this.

529
01:09:09,430 --> 01:09:14,170
This is supposed to be just she's playing games.

530
01:09:15,970 --> 01:09:20,440
It's. I do have some outcomes.

531
01:09:21,610 --> 01:09:29,800
Okay. So for things from 0 to 0 and pasted values into.

532
01:09:30,540 --> 01:09:42,480
Okay. And also the most most and this will be the input which change the dynamic speech sensitivity this.

533
01:09:46,150 --> 01:09:57,200
The reason why I call ticket coverage issues the most sensitive to issues to.

534
01:10:11,510 --> 01:10:18,510
Presidential politics should. Since.

535
01:10:20,910 --> 01:10:26,760
Teen pregnancy teen patients.

536
01:10:32,680 --> 01:10:46,400
Desmond Tutu. So that's what we do for patients with these.

537
01:10:52,710 --> 01:10:56,070
So I'm just like. Does that make sense?

538
01:10:56,310 --> 01:11:00,490
Like, I don't even know how you do that for like. So it's like these values be like, no treatment.

539
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:05,960
Like, I don't understand why this should be done. So to elaborate, this explains why this.

540
01:11:07,030 --> 01:11:15,090
My future research of the actual future specific.

541
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:31,060
Patients and patients have completed the actual cost of costume changes.

542
01:11:32,550 --> 01:11:44,060
This could be. And because that too.

543
01:11:44,060 --> 01:11:51,870
So when you get in the I suppose that's.

544
01:11:58,580 --> 01:12:09,850
And. It's similar to.

545
01:12:13,900 --> 01:12:20,810
Because this is this is two things.

546
01:12:21,810 --> 01:12:25,650
You have to think, now, what can I do to make it better?

547
01:12:26,190 --> 01:12:42,940
This seems to be the actual cost of this without the discounts is 9.77.

548
01:12:44,700 --> 01:13:09,240
Or this was from the other study. Right. And when I look at that, it actually gave to me increase, which was which was to justify the actual cost of.

549
01:13:09,250 --> 01:13:28,360
I don't. Any additional reports that I can of.

550
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:33,850
Okay. I'm going to look at working classes. Yeah, I can. Maybe I can, you know.

551
01:13:35,500 --> 01:13:42,040
Conditions. Let's break down.

552
01:13:44,890 --> 01:13:49,000
Crossed into my life during the surgery, tracking my resulting discussion.

553
01:13:50,050 --> 01:13:51,730
Yeah, which means it's less valuable now.

554
01:13:52,090 --> 01:14:12,700
It's more because there are so many conditions to use the services which in this case this is hopefully I don't know if, you know, 009 only.

555
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:25,760
I think it just costs three prison time to actually service further.

556
01:14:26,030 --> 01:14:32,280
Yeah. Now it should be able to have a chance, which is the thing.

557
01:14:32,290 --> 01:14:38,930
These people come up with something we don't have to change in the discussion.

558
01:14:41,790 --> 01:14:45,940
Yeah, you know, and the Americans. Would you want to just explain that?

559
01:14:46,210 --> 01:14:55,530
I know. That's why I asked you. Okay. I don't I don't know that these people might be breaking down.

560
01:14:55,990 --> 01:14:59,560
Yes. Because of the cost. Yes. This should.

561
01:14:59,620 --> 01:15:04,710
Yes, every persons. I think it's it's going already now.

562
01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:10,030
I'm like, okay, I don't mind.

563
01:15:10,240 --> 01:15:13,830
I mean, I do I have a good health care.

564
01:15:13,900 --> 01:15:18,750
You know, I don't.

565
01:15:30,580 --> 01:15:35,310
Okay. So I was just doing the discounts for an individual.

566
01:15:36,010 --> 01:15:43,810
I think I might be having fun. So I think you just missed your classes and that's you guys.

567
01:15:44,950 --> 01:15:50,980
And then we're getting this number of people. How would you rate.

568
01:15:51,940 --> 01:15:57,850
So, okay, so you have airline dance related.

569
01:15:58,030 --> 01:16:02,470
Okay. So I think this is this.

570
01:16:02,950 --> 01:16:09,430
So first of all, what is point nine, nine, seven. Yeah. That's the EMV for this in reverse for.

571
01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:17,710
So I got that right here. So that is this is 30 seconds actually goes to the decimal point.

572
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:21,880
And so this is when you have detected by planes or unprotected.

573
01:16:21,970 --> 01:16:25,730
So 19% of files were kept.

574
01:16:26,630 --> 01:16:35,260
And this is saying if you know and treating the injury you like this these

575
01:16:35,260 --> 01:16:39,910
this is because I was explaining invisibly visibly one of the possibilities.

576
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:53,250
So change one thing. I guess I would I might I might change the tree here is if insurance covers it.

577
01:16:53,470 --> 01:16:59,500
Yeah, this number is kind of difficult to interpret because it's this is kind of like for one person,

578
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:04,180
but on a on a mile a bike lane, you know, is there any one on one person?

579
01:17:04,450 --> 01:17:06,470
I was going to say this.

580
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:19,270
And so I don't think in these numbers, this these are probabilities of injury is that per mile per year or something like that?

581
01:17:21,460 --> 01:17:29,470
I don't think these are per mile. I think it will. So like I think it's like a good trial, but I don't think it's Vermont.

582
01:17:29,740 --> 01:17:35,650
So anyway, so that will have an impact on what they said. So if this is like the number of injuries per mile of bike lane,

583
01:17:37,150 --> 01:17:43,450
then you want to take this number and kind of multiply by the total number of people riding bikes.

584
01:17:43,570 --> 01:17:48,130
For my horse, point miles of bike bikes, miles traveled or should like them.

585
01:17:50,560 --> 01:18:00,250
And there are a couple different ways of thinking about these. These outcomes to me is right now this is kind of like, what's your quality of life?

586
01:18:00,250 --> 01:18:05,380
It was all those outcomes. But another way to think about it is, you know,

587
01:18:05,500 --> 01:18:17,620
and then you think about this bike idea of life so much based on someone once the only fun perhaps going to break.

588
01:18:18,820 --> 01:18:23,120
If I don't have a right to know. How are things going? Good, good, good.

589
01:18:23,320 --> 01:18:30,280
The way to think about this, assuming I'm out, so you're kind of adding up, it's like really fast period here.

590
01:18:30,290 --> 01:18:34,989
Yeah, because when we go to look for it is one from 4 to 4.

591
01:18:34,990 --> 01:18:39,550
So I woke up at like five five today.

592
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:45,070
It was the Cambridge Serbia game that was Canada.

593
01:18:46,530 --> 01:18:54,940
And instead of getting one player, getting five or six through divorce in terms of the quality,

594
01:18:54,950 --> 01:19:03,910
if Cameron came in scoring afterward, it's sort of like in there and service for another goal.

595
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:15,500
Instead of having this film, you know, for you say, oh, and mine is kind of like I see like yeah, crappy teams play a little bit or more high school.

596
01:19:15,550 --> 01:19:18,250
And the tricky thing here is what's your quality of life?

597
01:19:18,250 --> 01:19:27,370
And then over how long here this will be like if you if your quality of life is .76 per year.

598
01:19:28,330 --> 01:19:30,760
And I was an introvert. Now, if you think if that's your point,

599
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:41,230
if I think only among everybody senses when you're only losing your confidence to but for 1/12 of the year now the other the other problem is death.

600
01:19:41,740 --> 01:19:50,050
Right now you're saying, oh, you saw what is your highs for the rest, you know, the other 30 years you said people are like 40 or something.

601
01:19:50,470 --> 01:19:58,420
So anyway, you're losing a ton of qualities. If that person gets down to zero here, you've lost, you know, 30.
