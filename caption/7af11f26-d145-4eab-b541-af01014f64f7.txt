1
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:09,340
Something else to do.

2
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:19,740
I'm going to get started on today.

3
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:37,230
Our midterm is coming up next week, Thursday, in what's going to be from one interview to 51 minutes that has been made.

4
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:44,370
And there are six questions total and it evolved.

5
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:51,540
That's why I ask everyone to review the material and start at that point in time.

6
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:58,350
Granted. And the exam question is going to be, you know, similar to the homework questions.

7
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:02,250
And also these are the practice questions possible.

8
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:09,510
So that's why, you know, make sure that you understand all the questions reasonable.

9
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:12,600
Ask any questions.

10
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:17,450
Yes, it's up to like what topic is the exam I'm going to cover?

11
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:24,330
I'm going to cover everything that we learn, including today's lecture and next Tuesday stuff.

12
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,860
I'll find a way. The homework five, right.

13
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:38,700
The homework five is due tomorrow. So and the homework deadline by morning competency 146 50.

14
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:50,579
So make sure that is submitted homework by tomorrow, 5 p.m. And next week we're still going to assign homework or what do we have learned so far?

15
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:56,309
But we want graded, so we will post the solutions before the exam.

16
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:02,040
So you look at the solutions for the upcoming homework one grade.

17
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:10,900
This one said the big question is yes, so do we still need to submit it on your own?

18
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:14,249
You don't have to say we want grade eight.

19
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:18,030
We will collect it, but we are going to assign it our solutions.

20
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:26,580
So that's you can consider us apps for practice problems, questions and for the final exam.

21
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:33,090
Again, it's closed book, closed note, so you don't have to print anything other than you are,

22
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:39,630
you know, and you're going to provide papers, papers, papers.

23
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:57,030
And also you probably need a calculator, just basic functions in order to do some crazy calculations and any question on the exam.

24
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:05,360
All right. So last time we talked about a bunch of disregarded distributions,

25
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:17,240
we talk about that is a uniform distribution and then we talk about binomial and we ended up with talk of distribution.

26
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:21,350
And again, as a reminder,

27
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:30,650
we care about all this distributions or families of distributions because it really gave us a tool to capture the general distribution of the data.

28
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,670
So now we have extended for more general population.

29
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:41,600
We only need to collect a bunch of samples from the population to estimate the parameters in the distribution.

30
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:48,110
And once the distribution is known, we can use it to perform as part of the general population.

31
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:52,849
So that's why distributions are important and focus on distribution.

32
00:03:52,850 --> 00:04:03,440
For each distribution. We have CDP in our DNA in this case and moment generating functions, which essentially tells us many important information,

33
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:07,820
much important information about the distribution of Poisson distribution.

34
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:16,010
Previously, we know that it can be considered a the limited distribution for binomial.

35
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:25,250
If you allow the number of files, entity and times P go to a constant, then the limiting distribution, essentially the purpose of distribution.

36
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:32,000
So now let's take a look at how the postal distribution cause can be used in practice.

37
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:37,610
Recall that of course on distribution the support is all the non active integers.

38
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:43,820
So that gives a natural usage of this distribution for modeling counts.

39
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:50,959
For example, if we want to model the number of cases for a particular disease in this example,

40
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,400
for example, we know that that's rate among females in this age group.

41
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,480
Particular lung disease is a poor million.

42
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:06,250
And in a city of one meaning female, what is the probability distribution of the number?

43
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:15,420
So what we care about is. The number of cases, which is the count.

44
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:22,530
All right. They kind of range from zero one to all the way to a very large number in this case.

45
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:27,120
Conceptually, what is the distribution that it would use?

46
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:41,480
We should use. Based on just based on the description, what would be the the most rigorous distribution that are which are used?

47
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:50,300
To model the number of cases. Yes. Yes.

48
00:05:50,730 --> 00:06:04,170
I was going to say binomial, if we can fix the very good binomial great smiley, because in this case we don't have empiric support.

49
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:09,050
Right. Because we are looking on this particular city as our population.

50
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:13,490
So the city has a population of 1 million females in this age group.

51
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:24,090
That's how we're an upper limit. So you are running Marvel, which which captured the number of cases cannot exceed that upper bone.

52
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:33,060
So that may not be the most remarkable one in this case because it wasn't infinite support.

53
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,000
Right.

54
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:44,400
And also, conceptually, what I mean by this question is that each individual is independent and it has a chance for an immediate to have this disease.

55
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:51,390
Right. We can do this independent trial for each individual 1 million times.

56
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:56,790
That will give us the number of cases for this particular disease.

57
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:06,150
So that exactly follows a binomial set up. So relatively speaking, these run arrival of number of cases should be a binomial.

58
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:14,790
But as we argued before, if you like, and goes to infinity in this case and there's pretty large 1 million and is large,

59
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,149
you can use a proposal to approximate a binomial distribution.

60
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:23,640
So that's why is it's okay to use a plus on in this case to model the number of cases,

61
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:30,030
set this Y to be the number of cases which is our run a variable then.

62
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:40,640
Based on the argument we just gave. We know the event rate is four in the media.

63
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:44,780
Right. And this population is equal to 1 million.

64
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,980
So the plus rate in that case and times P is four.

65
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:52,910
So we can model this Y as a plus all around of our whole.

66
00:07:55,400 --> 00:08:05,770
With alumni quarter four and the unit or this plus our rate or this alumni parameter is the number of cases per median.

67
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:11,570
And so lambda equals four means four cases per million.

68
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:16,340
That's the rate of having cases in this population.

69
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:29,630
So once we specify the distribution for this random variable, we can give the probability of this random variable equal to each integer.

70
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:36,770
The other words we know the probability of having zero cases in this population, having one cases,

71
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:42,680
two cases, etc. So you can plug in the PM for cosine distribution and these are the numbers.

72
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:54,650
Okay. So as is the actual number of cases corresponding to the second column is your probability of having not many cases.

73
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:04,280
So you can also verify that if you do a binomial right, if your model line has a binomial.

74
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:15,820
With an equality of 1 million and p quota for over 1 million.

75
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:22,170
You can also provide the probabilities and you can check this to add to it.

76
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:31,530
Almost identical and very close to one another, maybe only up to third or fourth decimal points, but there are some difference.

77
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:43,350
So now let's try to change the question by assuming the city only has 10,000, 100,000 with women in this age group.

78
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:57,739
Then how does the probability distribution change? What I what I want to change here is essentially this is still a pretty large number,

79
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:01,160
so we can still use a placeholder to approximate this binomial distribution.

80
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:10,540
Now, the difference is that a new population has 100,000 people in this group.

81
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:21,320
In that case, by definition, our new line that will be end times P and P remains the same and becomes a tenfold smaller.

82
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:28,630
So that's the new line that would be point for. So that's the new rate.

83
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:42,250
And now the unit what the rate is number of cases per 100,000 people because that unit is determined by this population size.

84
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:51,400
The other words, on average, you're going to observe four cases in this population, in this 100,000 population.

85
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,200
So that's the unit corresponding to this population.

86
00:10:56,710 --> 00:11:01,810
And also, you can plug it in to this PPMO to get to the probabilities.

87
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:07,140
Now we can say the probabilities also changes, which makes sense.

88
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:17,229
All right. Because you have a smaller size, then the probability of having zero cases probably increases and the probability having more

89
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:23,080
cases would definitely be much smaller than the case where you have a much larger population.

90
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:31,209
So this is when the bottom line is when you use on these reviews that make sure that you double

91
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:37,300
check the unit or this the lambda parameter to make sure that it really captures what you're after.

92
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:45,370
Okay. Population next. That matters in determining the unit for this heart rate parameter.

93
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:55,420
Okay. Any questions about. All right.

94
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:09,630
So another way to write a post on distribution is to use if you want if you don't want to change the unit or for the lambda of this.

95
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:14,070
Plus on a raid parameter, you can also fix the unit, right?

96
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:24,720
You can fix the unit or unit population and then multiply additional parameter, which is the size of the population.

97
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:29,760
For example, you can always said lambda to be the rate over a thousand people.

98
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:35,790
Then it's a fixed value and for different population you just need to adjust your

99
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:41,750
corresponding head and treat this lambda times that as your new plus on rate parameters.

100
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:50,190
I also gave you the same comment. For example, if you treat lambda to be the unit of population to be 1 million,

101
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:59,550
then Lambda always takes about a fourth in this example because we always have four cases per million population.

102
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:06,660
To answer the second problem, if your actual population is 100,000,

103
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:14,580
that N is essentially just a one over ten of the unit population because our unit is 1 million.

104
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:25,320
If you multiply this to four times one over 10.4, it starts still that same distribution as we argued before.

105
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:35,310
So either way, you get the same result. But the bottom line is make sure that you use the correct unit for this lesson.

106
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:41,980
So once it gets past where our population has fixed.

107
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:50,210
And your question, so how is the distribution, how does the probability change beyond this and.

108
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:59,820
Right. So short answer is it will be say will be positive now zero, but it's going to be extremely small.

109
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:07,620
So in practice, essentially, we we would just ignore those tail probabilities because they are just so small.

110
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:19,050
And if you actually plug it in, you can say that these are as has become larger, the denominator will increase exponentially.

111
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:26,250
So this decays is very quickly. So you have very small tail probabilities in practice.

112
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:32,460
It just doesn't really change anything. Now the questions.

113
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:41,690
All right. So that's the example that we we love from our time today.

114
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:46,970
Let's continue and talk about some additional discard distributions.

115
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:53,360
So the next one that we're going to look at, we're going to look at is the geometric distribution.

116
00:14:53,900 --> 00:15:03,080
So before we introduce the formal definition, let's first review some column inequalities for geometric series.

117
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:11,450
Assume R is a real number that is between one and one absolute value of less than one.

118
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:15,320
Then we always have the following inequalities.

119
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:21,960
Again, these inequalities are very easy to prove but are very useful in practice.

120
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:25,730
You may want to memorize this for your benefit.

121
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,630
So the first one says if you.

122
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:39,870
Sum up the power series for this hour.

123
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:43,750
The power of one hour to the power zero or to the power one.

124
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:53,010
R squared r r to power three, etc. all the way to the power that is equal to the right hand side.

125
00:15:53,840 --> 00:16:00,540
And to prove it, you just multiply. This one minus are both side, and you can see a lot of times will cancel out.

126
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:08,020
So that's how you prove this that this series and the second one society that if you that

127
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:13,200
upper bound it goes to infinity then is going to be equal to one over one minus minus on.

128
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:26,770
So again, to prove it just one line it just like tables infinity on both sides since r has absolute value left on one side of the numerator,

129
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:31,410
these are to the plus one going a batch, right?

130
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:38,170
So that's what's left one over one minus R and if you start from J quarter one now,

131
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:42,670
just take one from the left hand side, move it to the right hand side.

132
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:44,920
You got to this R over one minus R.

133
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:55,210
And finally, if you start from Hey, you got R to the K over one, I saw that these are very useful geometric series inequalities.

134
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:08,569
So now let's consider again doing this independent and identical a distributed Bernoulli trials where the probability of

135
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:20,210
success is fixed to be a parameter P and we define a random variable Y to be the number of trials until the first success.

136
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:26,180
All right. Doing a trial, for example, flipping a coin.

137
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:32,150
And you record how many number of passes do you have to do in order to get a hat?

138
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:40,280
If you have a very court that as our random variable, then that random are going to follow a geometric distribution.

139
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:49,850
All right. So that's the the definition or the genesis of this geometric distribution.

140
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:59,180
And one thing to note is that in this definition, we do include the trial where that success occurs,

141
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:05,420
and we do include the last trial where the outcome is a success.

142
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:13,220
So first question, what is the support of this random variable by this definition?

143
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:19,580
All the positive integers, right?

144
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:28,460
Because you can have a success in the first trial, or maybe the first trial is a bit and then the second trial is a success.

145
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:36,830
Or if you are extremely unlucky, you can have infinite amount of failures in a row and no success,

146
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:41,270
which means you're going to have to do the experiment infinite times.

147
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:46,640
So the support for this Y is all the positive agents.

148
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:49,910
One, two, three, four. All the way through infinity. Okay.

149
00:18:50,810 --> 00:19:02,240
And more specifically, we can write out or we can also write out the PMS or this random variable just based on is how is defined.

150
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:11,330
We call that why is the number of trials that we need to do, the number of independent trials until we got a success.

151
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:17,120
So what do we know is that if for any integer, why small, why?

152
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,890
What that means is the first Y minus one trials.

153
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:25,670
They all have to be fitted, right?

154
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:40,550
Because otherwise it will start much earlier. So all y minus one trials has to be fair and the last trial has to be a success with a fixed sequence.

155
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:45,770
So the probability of this random variable, taking this small variable y,

156
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:56,360
small y is this key times one minus P to the power of one minus one because it's a sequential procedure, right?

157
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:03,530
The probability of this random variable Y taking small that small y is y minus t,

158
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:09,410
the failure rate to the power of a y minus one times the success rate in the last trial.

159
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:20,540
So that's how we can come up with this PMT, just based on how we define the random variable, that's the PMT.

160
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,570
And once we have the PM out,

161
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:35,270
we can also derive the the Sadia the CDF is the probability of y equals small y for any or any y and in particular it provides the integer right.

162
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:42,860
If Y equals to zero one to all the way to infinity.

163
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:59,030
And then we can continue to show that y is equal to what the sum of which I from one y.

164
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:12,810
That's all right. And if you plug in the corresponding piano, that's I from one to lie.

165
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:17,610
E one minus P high minus one.

166
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:26,740
Now we can use the geometric series that we just introduced to get the the simplified version of this summation.

167
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:38,450
Okay. So you can show that if you plug in not one of those equations, this is equal to one, minus one, minus p one.

168
00:21:52,230 --> 00:22:03,570
One thing to know is that if that here I start up one day because that's where the camp is defined or otherwise.

169
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:07,530
Otherwise this PMT function is always zero.

170
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:13,560
That's the only thing to to be.

171
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:21,070
Be mindful when you plug in those geometric bearings.

172
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:31,390
Any question. Okay.

173
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:39,440
So the compliment of this after a while, that's only part of why is capital light greater than light?

174
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:44,239
And that are by the definition of this event available.

175
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:49,580
It corresponds to the event where all first the Y trials are failures.

176
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:59,360
That also there is another way to say why this CDF has this particular form.

177
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:10,430
Because Syria, as we argued, is really the probability of this guy, the probability of this capital, while that's already tied to a small life.

178
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:22,460
So you can either go from the definition by writing out the summation from one to Y and use this geometric theories to show the final result.

179
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:27,380
Or you can take a shortcut by noticing that these.

180
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:32,150
Probability is one minus the probability of is complement set.

181
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:38,480
Which is why greater than one. It's the same thing.

182
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:42,950
But the search is a shortcut because if you look at this part,

183
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:51,740
the probability of this random variable greater than a constant because this is a geometric mathematical,

184
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:56,880
you know, there is a prevalent way to express this event.

185
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:08,420
If you run a variable text value greater than line, that just means the first Y trials are all the first Y trials all fail.

186
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:18,710
Right? Otherwise you are on a variable has to be a number, has to take a value that's smaller or equal to a small Y.

187
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:24,800
If it's greater than Y, then we know for sure that all of the first line trials fail.

188
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:32,240
So that just give us a direct way to calculate this probability.

189
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:40,370
If all first Y trials failed, not probability, it's just a 100 P to the power of y.

190
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:46,250
And I give you the same answer to the same.

191
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:59,450
So that's another way to calculate this. Can you kind of go from the definition or take this shortcut by noticing the meaning of this random variable?

192
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:08,180
Really, the key here is to get an equivalent expression of the event, which makes the computation much easier.

193
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:17,240
Any question. But that's the city of the American city for the geometric distribution.

194
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:22,430
Now, those two, we can now calculate the expectation, the variance.

195
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:35,600
Okay. I'll give you a couple of minutes and you can try to see whether you can derive this expectations and the variance for this right.

196
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:41,150
Available. Yeah.

197
00:25:41,470 --> 00:28:06,690
I'm here for your. And how far do you go?

198
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:15,659
You gotta keep our expectations. Okay.

199
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:23,550
So let's look at this together, say how to show this or the meme part again.

200
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:30,960
If you don't have a clue of how to derive the meme directly, just write out the definition, right?

201
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:42,300
So since this is a discrete random variable, the definition is just the sum of this line times the PMS for all the y values in the support,

202
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:47,900
which means Y from one to infinity, in this case orient.

203
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:52,710
In other words, it's the sum of Y from one to infinity.

204
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:59,190
This small y times, the probability of the run of our about taken by y expression.

205
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:04,230
And there are actually two ways to calculate this.

206
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:17,729
So first, let's look at the in more calculus oriented approach so we can directly plug in this PMT function.

207
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:27,840
So what do we get? Is some y times e times y minus p to the power of one minus one.

208
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:32,490
Okay. If we directly plug in the PMT function, that's what we have.

209
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:39,040
And now if you look at this formula, now is a tree, okay?

210
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:45,630
So it's not very straightforward and definitely it takes practice to master this tree is if you look at this.

211
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:53,890
This this formula inside the summation? Well, our goal is to get rid of the summation of points.

212
00:29:53,900 --> 00:30:09,180
Right. But if you look at the term inside, the summation reminds us of the derivative of the function P times y minus p to the power of y, right.

213
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:36,240
It's. So this part, this why time is pee.

214
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,000
Time is why Maya's piece is the power of why minus one.

215
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:48,540
If you look at about the fact that Y is changing just straight P and Y as you know, two parameters,

216
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:54,300
then this guy is essentially the derivative of this one minus P to the power of y.

217
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:58,410
What is the risk back to one minus P?

218
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:08,460
If you know with the calculus, if you take the derivative of this guy that gave you exactly y times y minus P to the power of y minus one.

219
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:12,600
Okay? And you take this P outside.

220
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:17,970
So that means the original summation now is equal to the summation of this guy.

221
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:21,120
And with some regularity conditions,

222
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:37,979
you can change the the order of this sum and this derivative so that you can have p times the derivative with respect to one minus p variable.

223
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:42,570
Put this sum y from one to infinity inside the derivative.

224
00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:54,510
Right. And the original summation now becomes this formula p times the derivative of this summation with respect to one minus.

225
00:31:55,830 --> 00:32:09,300
And now this summation, we can use this geometric series to write out the explicit form for this summation, which is the times the first.

226
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:18,470
One minus P over P the one minus.

227
00:32:20,810 --> 00:32:34,270
Okay. So here from lab to right, we use this geometric theories to change this summation, infinite summation to this close form one minus property.

228
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:39,110
Now, all we need to do is to take the derivative and multiply the.

229
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:47,710
You can take the derivative you would get. One over a piece square.

230
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:52,180
Okay. And finally, I give you one over the.

231
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:58,910
So that's the more calculus way of calculating this expectation.

232
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:09,890
So it's very tricky. So you have to notice that these are Y times one minus P to the power of Y, minus one is that derivative of some function.

233
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:15,800
And you also have to notice that you can switch the order of the summation and the derivative.

234
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:23,240
Once you switch in order, you can be easily evaluated and the final result can be upset.

235
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:30,440
Yes, that's the calculus way. Alternatively, you can also think about a more intuitive way.

236
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:44,480
Your. So it's about patients as a sum of these qualities, the sum of Y times, the probability of come to y equal to y.

237
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,970
The other words, if you really write it out,

238
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:59,930
that means the probability of y for one plus two times the probability of y for the two plus three times the probability of line for the three plus.

239
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:06,720
Etc. And once you write it out in this way,

240
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:17,370
it's not hard to notice that you can really combine these terms to make it more user friendly in a way that you can't take.

241
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:33,320
One of those life and the two life out of three out and combine them with one part one and again the first time.

242
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:38,360
And then you can combine everything to get a second term.

243
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:44,930
And you can do it for every sequence, right?

244
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:49,000
It's essentially going to become another summation of another sequence.

245
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:55,090
And if you look at this chart, what what does it what does the first parentheses correspond to?

246
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:04,580
What is the summation of life or one life to life or three, so on and so forth all the way through.

247
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:14,010
What's that? It's the seed of.

248
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:25,660
Very good. It's a city of. Equal to this guy, right?

249
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:38,090
In other words. It's the city of what, one minus the city out of a zero?

250
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:47,580
In this particular case since Y has a support one, two, three, five, five.

251
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:51,300
The first term actually is equal to one. Exactly. Equal to one.

252
00:35:53,330 --> 00:36:00,770
And similarly for the second term, you can also express it as one minus the city out of one,

253
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:10,189
because the second term corresponds to the probability of ly greater equal to two other words.

254
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:13,760
One minus y last are equal to one.

255
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:18,310
And so on, so forth. So eventually what you have is.

256
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:32,390
That's the mission. I fly from one to infinity, a probability of y, great output of y.

257
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:42,470
And that's the summation of line from one to infinity, one minus y.

258
00:36:55,720 --> 00:37:01,210
And now you can plug in this city and function into this formula.

259
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:05,260
So that gave you a summation of why from zero to infinity.

260
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:09,010
One minus P to the power of one again.

261
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:18,200
Now we can use the geometric theories that equality to simplify this, which also give you one or.

262
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:23,010
That's another way to measure how quick this.

263
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:31,910
So we can go either way. But again, for this case, its both ways are pretty tricky stuff.

264
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:48,350
Stuff involves some techniques in order to simplify the summation, but as I mentioned before, to simplify summation is there is no fixed formula.

265
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:54,270
I mean, sometimes you just have to be creative in terms of how to solve this type of problems.

266
00:37:55,290 --> 00:38:02,970
Here are just two additional tricks that you can use, maybe use for any other scenarios as well.

267
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:08,470
Any questions? All right.

268
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:21,750
So that's the myth that the man is one of our people. And what that means is that if you have a larger success rate, the moon becomes smaller, right?

269
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:25,270
Larger P corresponds to smaller me.

270
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:34,780
Which makes perfect sense because recall that a Y capture the number of cases, the number of trials until you have the first success.

271
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,350
If you have a higher chance of getting success,

272
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:47,920
then of course the average number of trials you have to do to get the first success is going to be smaller in the future.

273
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:56,170
So higher P corresponds to lower average for this run of our at.

274
00:38:58,850 --> 00:39:03,840
Next the Barents. Barents is equal to one over one minus P over a piece square.

275
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:07,260
So we're going to look at this derivation.

276
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:15,160
Well, this corresponds to a derivation in the negative binomial distribution, which we're going to see in a second.

277
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:19,980
So for now, let's just make a memorize this.

278
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:23,460
This of our expression is Y minus P over square.

279
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:27,030
Again, there is no very simple way to calculate this.

280
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:33,170
We definitely need. More is going to trace in order to get this final result.

281
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:42,520
All right. Any questions? Okay.

282
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:49,000
So this is general at the distribution functions for like geometric random variable.

283
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:55,810
Now a couple of properties for this show, matching distribution.

284
00:39:55,840 --> 00:40:00,040
First of all, let's take a step back and look at the PMT function.

285
00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:16,760
The piano function, if you draw it. It only takes non-active values at these other villages.

286
00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:18,850
Everywhere else, it's always zero.

287
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:27,110
And if you look at the actual form of this PMA function, you can notice that for any PE from 0 to 1, it's always a decreasing function.

288
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:32,210
In other words, the probability of Y for one is always the largest.

289
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:46,130
It's always the highest which has a value. What if ya1 that give you p and the second one is always smaller or lower?

290
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:53,180
So that's p times one minus p and the next one gets even lower and so on, so forth.

291
00:40:53,570 --> 00:40:56,570
So it's always going to be a decreasing sequence.

292
00:40:57,410 --> 00:41:03,770
I like the puzzling case or the binomial case, or you may have mode somewhere else or geometric.

293
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:07,120
You always have the monad line for one, right?

294
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:14,000
That's one property. Another very important property is called a memory license property.

295
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:28,070
So things like let's suppose you have 2002 years cannot pay is greater than it doesn't have to be integer just two numbers, two positive numbers.

296
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:34,340
And then the following equation always holds for geometric distribution.

297
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:39,320
That is the conditional probability of y greater euphoric.

298
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:48,110
Given that a y is greater, the high is always equal to the probability of y greater equal to came out.

299
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:56,720
All right. The conditional probability is always equal to the marginal probability on the right hand side.

300
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:09,890
So what that means is that if you conditional upon the fact that this run available takes values greater than a particular cutoff,

301
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:19,560
not cutoff is high then. The distribution for the conditional round,

302
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:28,780
a conditional distribution for this random variable beyond that point is almost like is it exactly a new geometric sequence?

303
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:34,990
So in other words, you can consider two random variables.

304
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:39,730
What is the roundabout of a Y? So the other is a conditional random variable.

305
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:44,980
Y minus I favor y is greater than high.

306
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:52,760
So this is another round of arable. Even why is greater than I.

307
00:42:53,300 --> 00:43:02,030
My minus sign is a new roundabout. So these two always have the same distribution and they are equal in distribution.

308
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:06,110
So that's what the memory list in this property is talking about.

309
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:13,220
So here is the example before I gave you the proof of that theory as an example of what that means.

310
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:17,960
Suppose we capture the number of years that you can leave,

311
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:26,540
and then if you model this number of years that someone can leave as a geomagnetic distribution,

312
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:36,020
what that tells us is that the probability of y greater or equal to to the other words, the individuals survive beyond two years.

313
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:50,800
Own is the same as the probability of given the subject is already, say, 91 the probability that he will, he or she will survive beyond 93.

314
00:43:51,800 --> 00:44:02,930
Those two probabilities are the same. So that's what's called memory laziness, because given the condition, you are greater than your current age.

315
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:08,440
These are unavailable. Essential. I forgot everything that happened before that.

316
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:17,500
And as a fresh start from that one, following exactly the same distribution as its original distribution.

317
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:22,390
So that's why it's called a memory license, conditional upon something.

318
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:30,950
You erase all the memories before that condition. But this review, from a distribution point of view, they are identical.

319
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:40,490
Okay. So mathematically what I mean is, is that the Y has the same distribution where Y minus I given is greater than.

320
00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:51,980
Right. So that's called the memory loss. And apparently, Jo Mazzocchi distribution in that sense is not a very good distribution for Model Y age.

321
00:44:53,150 --> 00:45:00,110
Right. It doesn't really make sense to assume the probability of someone that has survived beyond

322
00:45:00,110 --> 00:45:07,760
two years old is the same as someone who is already 90 is going to survive beyond 92.

323
00:45:08,990 --> 00:45:14,430
Those two probabilities shouldn't be the same. Otherwise, we're going to be in big trouble.

324
00:45:14,450 --> 00:45:18,890
Right? So this memory loss and this property is not a problem.

325
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:24,110
It's not a do it for modeling age because it doesn't take into account having sex.

326
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:33,920
But in some cases it might be a very desirable property to use to to have so young in case this

327
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:40,700
is a property for this particular distribution and allow us to take a look online at this case.

328
00:45:40,730 --> 00:45:42,560
The proof actually is pretty standard.

329
00:45:42,890 --> 00:45:48,890
All we need to do to show this equality is to write out what's on the top and what's on the right and show that they are equal.

330
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:56,030
And to write what's on the land is C. You just need to use the definition of this conditional probability.

331
00:45:56,750 --> 00:46:03,890
Recall that the conditional probability just means the probability of the of the intersection of these two events.

332
00:46:04,370 --> 00:46:08,150
Divided by the probability of the condition. Right.

333
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:14,239
So the numerator should be the probability of y greater and quadratic and y greater.

334
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:18,530
The height and the denominator is the probability of y great design.

335
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:25,700
Okay. And if you look into the numerator is always greater than I.

336
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:31,080
So that is just the equivalent to say a y rhetorical.

337
00:46:31,110 --> 00:46:38,060
Okay. You can simply drop y greater than height because like always implies library design.

338
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:43,670
Right. So that's why you have this y greater than K and numerator.

339
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:54,260
And now you can plug in the PPMO or PDA or the transformation of CDP into the numerator and denominator.

340
00:46:54,530 --> 00:47:00,380
And this is what you have. Okay. So the for the numerator, you have this one minus P to the power K minus one,

341
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:12,590
because the probability of Y going on is the same as probability of y that are equal to minus one and one minus nine.

342
00:47:13,510 --> 00:47:23,360
Okay. That's a complement said and I gave you this one minus P to the power of minus one and the denominator that denominators Y minus

343
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:35,540
P two and a ratio is this quantity which again corresponds to the probability of Y greater minus which is the right hand side.

344
00:47:38,490 --> 00:47:46,510
Right. So that's the memorize this property for this geometric distribution.

345
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:52,030
So next time we see people use geometric distribution to model something.

346
00:47:53,080 --> 00:48:06,370
One question that you may ask yourself or is whether that particular fan has this memory or follow this memory of this property.

347
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:16,360
If it is a great if it doesn't, then probably geometric distribution may not be the most suitable distribution for that particular person.

348
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:27,360
So in some textbooks, you may see the definition of genocide distribution slightly differently.

349
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:35,370
Sometimes people just model the number of trials before the first success and coined the geometric.

350
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:43,729
This review you read about, if that's the case, then you're going to have slightly different PMF and support to support.

351
00:48:43,730 --> 00:48:45,840
We're going to be starting from zero, right?

352
00:48:46,230 --> 00:48:54,000
If you only record the number of videos before the first success, then that's going to change and the PMS change as well.

353
00:48:54,960 --> 00:49:08,460
It's only going to be you still have to account for the fact that the last trial is a success, but now a for each of why you have light periods.

354
00:49:09,090 --> 00:49:17,040
So that's why it one minus PPI has the power term right so that that's the new and once your

355
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:22,470
chance to this new PMS from this new support all the moments derivation is going to be different.

356
00:49:23,010 --> 00:49:31,320
You don't have the mean to be one over P you don't have the bands to be P, to be y minus p over p square.

357
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:36,930
You're going to have different formulas for that, but just be very careful.

358
00:49:37,470 --> 00:49:42,390
So make sure which definition you use.

359
00:49:42,450 --> 00:49:49,050
Both definitions are correct, technically correct, but sometimes one may be more convenient than the other.

360
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:59,370
In this course, we're going to stick with the first one. We're going to use light to model the number of trials, including the last success.

361
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:05,700
Any questions? All right.

362
00:50:05,700 --> 00:51:11,130
So let's take a break and come back. Has to do with you to see if you want to keep trying to cross the line.

363
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:49,530
And I'll try to do now once you want to, you can have some equals.

364
00:51:50,580 --> 00:52:06,630
So everything is so easy to use, which means that we can call the one.

365
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:20,740
We're not going to work on this.

366
00:52:20,930 --> 00:52:36,080
Yeah, it's very nice. You would be familiar with me.

367
00:52:37,250 --> 00:52:49,900
I'll go through all of to please remember.

368
00:52:50,420 --> 00:53:09,060
We're going to look forward because some people will remember how to sort of see what you look like.

369
00:53:11,550 --> 00:53:14,880
You can read from sort of even.

370
00:53:19,850 --> 00:53:23,730
All right.

371
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:42,260
So, I mean, it's the same sort of I just wish was at a point where there was no such thing.

372
00:53:49,150 --> 00:54:25,250
However, the of things were you always keep in touch with my partner could choose to do you want to do what would you like me to do?

373
00:54:28,350 --> 00:54:47,229
That's why I wasn't it wasn't enough for me.

374
00:54:47,230 --> 00:55:03,000
It was a very long time ago.

375
00:55:03,610 --> 00:55:20,230
Which is what you said, that he wasn't really.

376
00:55:20,620 --> 00:56:45,310
It's just all of a sudden, you know, like, I was like, you know, I know that we should be like, oh, my gosh, you know what's coming out of control?

377
00:56:53,890 --> 00:57:23,490
Please let me know when it comes to do that.

378
00:57:24,970 --> 00:57:30,880
So that's what I'm doing right now.

379
00:57:31,990 --> 00:58:07,450
I want you to take all of your questions and maybe even what you think you might not even as well, because I.

380
00:58:21,550 --> 00:58:25,330
Thank you, Chris.

381
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:50,260
Obviously, you're going to get on the to where it's hard for you to think we should be supporting the reduction targets,

382
00:58:52,120 --> 00:59:07,569
although there are other systems in order to get more media back on stock.

383
00:59:07,570 --> 00:59:17,590
As you wish. So there is an example for the geometry of distribution.

384
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:25,200
We don't actually run a variable. We want to study the human fraternity.

385
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:32,950
Fertility researchers are very interested in exposures that increase the time it takes for that so

386
00:59:32,980 --> 00:59:41,080
they can see if a woman has one quarter of a chance to respond to conceiving in a particular cycle.

387
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:46,420
What is the probability that she becomes pregnant on the third cycle?

388
00:59:47,470 --> 00:59:58,750
So that's the first question. So I want to give you a couple of minutes to think about this question and particularly consider three questions.

389
00:59:59,140 --> 01:00:04,460
One is, how do you set up a random variable, right?

390
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:13,690
Second, what is the distribution of that runabout? Third, how do we translate this event of interest?

391
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:21,850
The probability that the woman becomes pregnant from a third cycle in terms of the run of arable.

392
01:00:25,140 --> 01:00:31,600
Well, what we're about to use.

393
01:00:31,870 --> 01:00:35,320
What's the distribution? How do you translate this problem?

394
01:01:02,010 --> 01:01:05,460
All right. First question, what is the run of? How do we set up a run?

395
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:12,210
To answer this question. And the idea.

396
01:01:17,450 --> 01:01:22,010
Yes. So the numbers cycle that she becomes pregnant aren't good.

397
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:27,350
The number of cycles or.

398
01:01:33,170 --> 01:01:39,260
Number of cycles through pregnancy. If we set up the right environment this way, then first of all,

399
01:01:39,260 --> 01:01:45,440
we can say directly that support is going to be one, two or three all the way through to infinity.

400
01:01:46,430 --> 01:01:49,070
Right. And also, by definition,

401
01:01:50,240 --> 01:02:03,440
the number of cycles for pregnancy should fall a distribution because it'll record the number of cycles until the first success.

402
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:10,370
Here, success means because they are from conception, right?

403
01:02:11,090 --> 01:02:15,080
That's exactly the definition of a moderate distribution.

404
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:21,979
But that also is a second question. Why suppose it's your matching distribution then?

405
01:02:21,980 --> 01:02:25,520
What's the probability or what's the parameter for this distribution?

406
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:29,390
What do we consider as a success? What do we consider as a failure?

407
01:02:29,990 --> 01:02:33,920
If we set up that number the Y to be number of cycles to pregnancy?

408
01:02:36,610 --> 01:02:40,480
The success is what can save you, right?

409
01:02:41,650 --> 01:02:44,890
And that has a chance of 25%.

410
01:02:45,340 --> 01:03:01,120
So that gave us a parameter for this geometric distribution is supposed to have a 1 to 5 probability of success and 175 probability of failure.

411
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:08,560
And that's why just consider how many cycles you have to take until you've got the first success, right?

412
01:03:08,770 --> 01:03:15,370
So that gave us the first two. And finally, to answer this question, we need to translate it in terms of this random variable,

413
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:26,230
the probability of the woman becoming pregnant on the third cycle using this random variable, what does that equal to the probability of what?

414
01:03:34,170 --> 01:03:38,910
Yes. I'm sorry. All right. Good night.

415
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:47,460
Why? About a story that means a woman becomes pregnant on the third cycle.

416
01:03:47,970 --> 01:03:54,000
The number of cycles of pregnancy in 3 to 3 years and then 6 hours.

417
01:03:55,080 --> 01:04:01,780
All right, now this first problem becomes the calculation of probability, life or death.

418
01:04:02,140 --> 01:04:17,040
Three, also that you can just plug it into into the PMA or this geometric distribution, which is 1 to 5 1.75 to the parallel two.

419
01:04:18,450 --> 01:04:22,230
Right. The final number. Yes.

420
01:04:24,180 --> 01:04:32,670
So that's the third stuff that you went into some phones that are with respect to that random variable.

421
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:37,530
Okay. All right. Next question. What is the expression number of cycles?

422
01:04:37,530 --> 01:04:43,080
Two, how do we translate that in using the random variable that we just said?

423
01:04:45,220 --> 01:04:57,110
What are we calculating? Well, it's in the question.

424
01:04:57,110 --> 01:05:02,900
Right. Expect a number of signposts to prognoses. So the expectation of one.

425
01:05:04,430 --> 01:05:10,040
All right. And that's one over P in this case, one over five.

426
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:18,950
So four. And finally, what's our probability of not becoming prime then, within 12 cycles?

427
01:05:19,250 --> 01:05:22,850
How do we translate that? What are we celebrating?

428
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:29,980
And what? Yes. By a larger than 12.

429
01:05:30,530 --> 01:05:41,960
Why greater than 12 are good. Right now I'm pregnant within five cycles means the number of cycles of pregnancy must be greater than 12.

430
01:05:43,070 --> 01:05:47,900
So that's the probability. Yeah, that was last one minus.

431
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:51,440
Uh, well, all right.

432
01:05:51,590 --> 01:05:55,910
One minus, one minus the probability of Y Lazare point of 12.

433
01:05:56,300 --> 01:06:00,110
So plug in the formula and calculate the final number.

434
01:06:01,780 --> 01:06:06,700
Right. So to answer this type of questions, always follow this three steps.

435
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:12,730
First, because what is the right environment to use? Second, what is the distribution for the right environment?

436
01:06:12,940 --> 01:06:21,000
Third, how do you translate the event into something that's calculated using right about your area?

437
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:25,149
You're doing the kind of final honest answer by just following in three steps.

438
01:06:25,150 --> 01:06:28,960
At least you got a very good idea of how to proceed.

439
01:06:30,290 --> 01:06:34,669
The rest is just the technicalities. All right.

440
01:06:34,670 --> 01:06:39,979
Any question before I move on to the next distribution? All right.

441
01:06:39,980 --> 01:06:48,410
So the next one coming up is the negative binomial distribution, and it's very similar to the geometric distribution, but slightly more complicated.

442
01:06:49,100 --> 01:06:52,550
Still consider the case of Idi Bernoulli trials.

443
01:06:53,090 --> 01:07:03,430
Now, instead of defining the number of trials until we got the first says, we consider the number of trials required to have as successes.

444
01:07:04,050 --> 01:07:12,320
Okay, that's an additional degree of freedom in this distribution.

445
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:20,960
As a result, we can set the number of trials required now to assess successes as a random variable,

446
01:07:21,170 --> 01:07:24,770
and that around about what we call it, has a negative binomial distribution.

447
01:07:25,610 --> 01:07:36,350
Sometimes we use this and B to represent negative binomial, and in this case it has two parameters to fully define this right available.

448
01:07:36,650 --> 01:07:44,840
What is the success rate of P for each trial? And another is the number of successes that you require, which is that's.

449
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:53,580
And by definition we know the support for this minor variable must start from us.

450
01:07:54,120 --> 01:08:01,680
If you are super lucky now, you got as successes in the first as trials and then you're done right.

451
01:08:02,310 --> 01:08:11,400
But if you are super unlikely, then again you can have you can conduct numerous or infinite trials and don't get your successes.

452
01:08:11,710 --> 01:08:18,090
Yeah, we got some, but not all that success from the offer of only selling affinity.

453
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:22,950
So the support is as as plus one, as plus two all the way to infinite.

454
01:08:24,540 --> 01:08:31,320
And if all the piano again, we can derive the PMF following the definition of this random variable.

455
01:08:31,990 --> 01:08:35,160
If you want to get our successes right.

456
01:08:36,570 --> 01:08:39,360
If you want to evaluate the probability of.

457
01:08:42,090 --> 01:08:50,970
The number of trials to be equal to this small y where y takes value as as a finite plus two all the way up to infinity.

458
01:08:51,930 --> 01:08:56,910
If you need y trials in order to get 6000, what does that mean?

459
01:08:59,830 --> 01:09:04,690
You must have. First of all, you must have a success in the last trial, right?

460
01:09:05,290 --> 01:09:12,100
If you don't have a success in the last trial, either you haven't reached your successes or you have reached your successes.

461
01:09:12,460 --> 01:09:16,600
Way before the last trial. So the last one must be a success.

462
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:22,540
Does that make sense? The last one must be a success, that's for sure.

463
01:09:22,870 --> 01:09:28,570
And for the remaining one minus one trials, how many successes do we have?

464
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:38,920
Spence. What exactly as minus one, right? Because that's the only case where you of have as successes in total.

465
01:09:39,580 --> 01:09:44,530
So that gave us an idea of how to derive the probability of life out of smoking.

466
01:09:45,010 --> 01:09:56,080
That is, you have this y minus one choose as minus one, simply choosing which as minus one trials from the first Y minus my trials are successes.

467
01:09:56,680 --> 01:10:01,120
All right. And then you have this probabilities.

468
01:10:01,780 --> 01:10:09,400
The first is the probability of those as minus one trials must be successes of key to the has minus one,

469
01:10:09,850 --> 01:10:15,010
and Q to the Y minus us means the remaining trials has to be years.

470
01:10:15,340 --> 01:10:20,200
And the last we also has a p indicating the last trial has to be a success.

471
01:10:21,290 --> 01:10:27,490
You multiply all this together, you got a tumor or the probability of this one of our all taken by y.

472
01:10:27,940 --> 01:10:39,640
But if you further simplify that I give you the formula y minus one choose as minus one to the right and ask Q to the Y minus s here.

473
01:10:40,030 --> 01:10:47,780
Q is just a one minus P and. So that's how we can derive the piano just from a definition.

474
01:10:52,050 --> 01:10:55,140
Any question about this? Yeah, not.

475
01:11:02,890 --> 01:11:09,040
So for Natalie Binomial there is no post form for CDP unfortunately,

476
01:11:10,180 --> 01:11:16,660
but we do have a whole farm for the expectation and parents in particular for expectation.

477
01:11:17,050 --> 01:11:24,310
It's as over p and four barrens is as times one minus p over p square.

478
01:11:25,930 --> 01:11:30,940
Again, here as is the number of successes. P is the success rate each trial.

479
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:39,490
So before we derive this, let's take a moment to just look at his followers and say what that is implying.

480
01:11:40,060 --> 01:11:52,930
First of all, the mean Passover peak. If you require more success, is the mean going to increase larger as corresponds to a larger Y?

481
01:11:53,800 --> 01:11:59,920
Which makes sense because the more success that they require, the more trials you need to conduct.

482
01:12:01,240 --> 01:12:11,290
And also the smaller the success rate, the more trials you will have to conduct in order to get the same number of successes.

483
01:12:12,100 --> 01:12:20,950
So as our P makes perfect sense and second, it's worth noticing that if you think about how we define, it's not a binomial.

484
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:26,050
If you only require one success that exactly reduces to that geometric roundabout.

485
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:38,379
Right? In other words, inactive binomial random variable with p and a one in exactly a geometry run of arable with profit.

486
01:12:38,380 --> 01:12:42,940
Our P because they have exactly the same definition.

487
01:12:43,780 --> 01:12:46,930
The number of trials required to have a one success.

488
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:54,350
Right. And that's also why if you site has to be one, that's the same me and Barry's four.

489
01:12:54,400 --> 01:13:04,000
There's no natural amount of arable. Okay, so now let's take a look at how to derive these two together.

490
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:11,050
If we can derive this to it, also solve the question of how we got the balance by the geometric roundabout.

491
01:13:11,980 --> 01:13:23,650
So let's take a look. To do that, we just roughly try to calculate this the moment for the run of our y.

492
01:13:24,250 --> 01:13:33,160
And it's a y follows a negative binomial he has which means a CDF is.

493
01:13:36,810 --> 01:13:40,370
My minus one. Minus one.

494
01:13:41,490 --> 01:13:45,320
He was. Q Why?

495
01:13:53,280 --> 01:14:00,839
So that's directly derived what the expectation of light and power and is by definition.

496
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:06,180
That's why as has been very quiet to the end.

497
01:14:07,260 --> 01:14:29,150
And then you multiply a power. And so that's the definition and that we need to do something to get rid of this submission.

498
01:14:32,090 --> 01:14:41,850
And that's the same tree as we used before, is to break down this ancient part and see whether we can simplify in some way.

499
01:14:43,770 --> 01:14:52,220
Break down this aren't you can y minus one Oreo are y as.

500
01:14:58,290 --> 01:15:12,570
You can see. So the trick that we use here is try to derive iterative formula.

501
01:15:13,470 --> 01:15:20,040
If we can somehow reduce this expectation of Y and to expectation of Y and minus one,

502
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:29,670
then we can use that iteratively to derive all of the ends of our moment expression because we know what the first order expression,

503
01:15:30,060 --> 01:15:37,110
what the first order moment is, right? Then we can use that iterative formula to give us all high order moments.

504
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:42,840
So that's the idea. So one thing that we can do is to instead of, you know,

505
01:15:43,260 --> 01:15:49,620
a move Y to the power of an we can take one Y out and combine it with the Y minus one factorial.

506
01:15:50,250 --> 01:15:56,260
So that gives us Y to the power of a minus one, which is desirable, right?

507
01:15:56,700 --> 01:16:01,020
Because now it has one order lower.

508
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:16,020
If we can somehow manipulate the remaining term to make them a piano or the same geometric distribution or the same exact binomial distribution,

509
01:16:16,020 --> 01:16:23,790
or slightly different than the next negative binomial, at least we can have a minus one outer moment expression.

510
01:16:24,630 --> 01:16:32,190
So that's five. Then you have y factorial as a factorial, y minus as a factorial.

511
01:16:32,610 --> 01:16:39,990
And since you changed or even has minus one, two has, you have to multiply us to make them equal.

512
01:16:40,290 --> 01:16:45,110
And. Now give us.

513
01:16:50,700 --> 01:16:58,450
Take this as out. That's why. One why has he.

514
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:03,390
Q Why? My sense.

515
01:17:06,540 --> 01:17:14,040
Now we need to do something to change our variables in order to make sure that these term is also the PM or some and actually binomial.

516
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:21,450
So the way that we do it is it's to set us to be y above one and t to be as plus one.

517
01:17:24,270 --> 01:17:28,620
Is that as accepted as your new parameters.

518
01:17:29,370 --> 01:17:40,950
You have as to be from the.

519
01:17:46,530 --> 01:18:00,930
Kennedy or he was one of the C huge X minus T times.

520
01:18:04,510 --> 01:18:08,670
Migrants once en route.

521
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:16,070
So you can verify this equation after class.

522
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:22,870
So what I did is to change the original parameters to give this new parameters.

523
01:18:24,590 --> 01:18:31,880
Really, the idea behind this is to make this the power of another negative binomial distribution.

524
01:18:32,210 --> 01:18:40,670
Recall that the power of a natural binomial always take this form y minus one, chosen as minus one, peters as Q to the Y minus us.

525
01:18:41,030 --> 01:18:46,160
But once you change the change, the variable, you kind of have exactly the same format.

526
01:18:47,300 --> 01:18:55,100
Now you can say these term is other 99.

527
01:18:55,130 --> 01:19:09,260
Okay. All right. So the actually increase part is exactly the same negative binomial partnership where he is a different.

528
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:19,810
It has become a negative binomial with parameter P and as a plus one.

529
01:19:20,540 --> 01:19:28,780
In other words P.A. And what this is is the expectation of.

530
01:19:32,530 --> 01:19:37,360
P times the expectation of x minus one to the.

531
01:19:41,630 --> 01:19:52,580
One to the power of the mind is one where ax follows inductive binomial p as possible.

532
01:20:04,030 --> 01:20:09,370
All right. So now what we have is if the original right honorable from a follows and let's say by all

533
01:20:09,370 --> 01:20:20,020
M.P.s the ANS order moment is equal to RS over p times and minus one outer moment or another.

534
01:20:20,170 --> 01:20:35,890
I said binomial minus one. The new binomial has parameter and ask plus one since we know that for the first of the moment for a negative binomial is.

535
01:20:46,380 --> 01:20:51,320
So you can derive the first order moment for any negative binomial to be possible.

536
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:58,820
Essentially use the same tree that we use to derive geometric distribution and derive this energy.

537
01:20:58,860 --> 01:21:06,270
Can you take advantage of this? You taught Twitter followers to get higher order moments.

538
01:21:08,790 --> 01:21:15,620
In particular fault lines square. No, that's equal to the as p.

539
01:21:16,860 --> 01:21:25,140
I want you to find out what you've got to choose as the power of what that's going to be has a where he.

540
01:21:26,920 --> 01:21:30,130
As plus one or P minus one.

541
01:21:32,640 --> 01:21:38,310
All right, so you just plug in this, uh, this formula, and I give you the second order moment.

542
01:21:38,970 --> 01:21:45,270
And combining this two moments, you can get the balance, which has this point.

543
01:21:50,260 --> 01:21:54,760
Again, I know this is a tricky derivation, but the idea,

544
01:21:54,760 --> 01:21:59,560
if you think about the core idea behind this derivation is the same as what we have done before.

545
01:22:00,580 --> 01:22:06,220
We just try to make this complete piano so that we can get rid of this summation.

546
01:22:06,910 --> 01:22:17,890
And instead of directly getting rid of the summation by setting it to be one here we use that iterative approach by getting another expectation,

547
01:22:18,070 --> 01:22:23,410
but off the lower order. That way, if we know the first order, we can always use this.

548
01:22:24,340 --> 01:22:29,270
It's got a higher. That makes sense.

549
01:22:30,540 --> 01:22:33,890
It's going to take sometimes to, you know, absorb this.

550
01:22:35,090 --> 01:22:39,110
So after class,

551
01:22:39,110 --> 01:22:49,010
I hope you have a chance to derive it to yourself and really understand how this actually works and can be used to get a higher order of this.

552
01:22:50,060 --> 01:22:56,570
But I autohome we're not talking about a fake question.

553
01:22:56,660 --> 01:23:02,000
We're not. All right.

554
01:23:02,390 --> 01:23:12,770
So some remarks when I say binomial first one, we have mentioned that if you set out to be one, that's exactly a geometric and the second property,

555
01:23:12,770 --> 01:23:19,549
the second remark is a very interesting one that says a negative binomial was parameter as he

556
01:23:19,550 --> 01:23:27,770
is actually can be expressed as a sum of as geometric random variables with the same property.

557
01:23:28,340 --> 01:23:42,110
In other words, if you have y following this negative binomial as p and x12 as as following this geometric rent available and they are independent.

558
01:23:42,710 --> 01:23:51,170
Okay then you kind of right you can have this equation.

559
01:23:51,350 --> 01:23:56,150
Y is equal to x one plus x two all the way to us.

560
01:23:57,290 --> 01:24:05,510
And this equal it means equal distribution. And the reason for that is, is very intuitive.

561
01:24:05,900 --> 01:24:09,560
Think about how we construct a negative binomial distribution.

562
01:24:10,070 --> 01:24:13,490
We need to conduct a sequence of trials, right?

563
01:24:14,030 --> 01:24:20,270
If you start doing trials, independent trials, you have media fair success.

564
01:24:25,510 --> 01:24:29,170
Bitter, bitter, bitter, bitter success, etc.

565
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:34,390
I'll tell you. We got it. Got you. This is your first success.

566
01:24:34,660 --> 01:24:42,460
Is it a success? I'll tell you who you are as the success and the total number is.

567
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:50,800
You run out a lot. But that's how we construct a binomial as p.

568
01:24:52,330 --> 01:24:59,380
Now, if you break down this sequence of trials, the sequence of results, what does this part corresponds to?

569
01:25:01,170 --> 01:25:11,370
That's also a sequence of trials, right? The number of trials this number of trials follows.

570
01:25:13,930 --> 01:25:19,240
A geometric peak because this cyclone was on trial until we got the first success.

571
01:25:19,830 --> 01:25:30,130
Right. So this sequence is another geometric missed parameter, right?

572
01:25:30,820 --> 01:25:35,170
You kind chop chop into small into small segments.

573
01:25:37,870 --> 01:25:43,899
Until we get to the last piece where the number again follows a geometric parameter.

574
01:25:43,900 --> 01:25:49,450
P So that gave us an idea that in fact this negative binomial has he has the

575
01:25:49,450 --> 01:25:54,230
same distribution as the summation of this as geometric right of our rules.

576
01:25:58,550 --> 01:26:03,960
So that's the relation between those two and another.

577
01:26:04,220 --> 01:26:13,060
Another note that I want to make you aware is that again, sometimes people will didn't know.

578
01:26:13,070 --> 01:26:23,420
They decided there probably they can. You know, the narrative by our binomial roundabout is the number of trials before the success.

579
01:26:23,900 --> 01:26:29,660
So in that case, their definition is essentially our definition minus one.

580
01:26:30,170 --> 01:26:37,430
And again, that personally I think that's a very bad definition, says it makes the computation much,

581
01:26:37,430 --> 01:26:42,589
much more tedious, but sometimes people just use it for other purposes.

582
01:26:42,590 --> 01:26:51,890
So just keep in mind, check what the exact definition is when you, you know, use it in practice.

583
01:26:52,130 --> 01:26:59,000
And again, when you use a different definition, you would have different moments, different PMS, everything changed even.

584
01:26:59,180 --> 01:27:11,900
They just, you know, they provide one. And lastly, if you have a sequence, if you conduct a sequence of independent trials and it this result success,

585
01:27:12,230 --> 01:27:20,420
failure or success, beta, etc., if you got this sequence, what is the probability of having this sequence?

586
01:27:21,590 --> 01:27:26,479
Assume they are conducting this independent trials with success.

587
01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:29,840
Repeat. What is the probability of having this sequence?

588
01:27:32,870 --> 01:27:36,080
That's a probability question. So don't overthink it.

589
01:27:36,830 --> 01:27:42,770
What's the probability of carrying this sequence if you can start a sequence of independent trials?

590
01:27:51,530 --> 01:27:54,770
Because it wasn't clear if you were conducting a sequence of independent trials.

591
01:27:55,220 --> 01:27:59,450
Each trial has successfully piece in the probability of carrying this sequence.

592
01:28:14,980 --> 01:28:19,910
And what is the key to a power of six?

593
01:28:20,530 --> 01:28:25,370
One management's very good. Peter the six cure to the.

594
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:33,760
All right. Not exactly the probability of this sequence, because the first try is a success.

595
01:28:33,770 --> 01:28:39,979
So it has a probability. The second try is the theory also is assessed as probability.

596
01:28:39,980 --> 01:28:46,219
Q Or another word is one minus B here's just multiply all of these probabilities.

597
01:28:46,220 --> 01:28:49,460
You've got the probability for this sequence.

598
01:28:51,230 --> 01:28:55,040
And so that's the probability of carrying this particular sequence.

599
01:28:55,580 --> 01:29:03,050
But the tricky part is you can consider this sequence to come from a binomial distribution

600
01:29:03,260 --> 01:29:10,460
or from a negative binomial and a once you give it a channel type of distribution,

601
01:29:10,580 --> 01:29:20,540
either from binomial or an active binomial, with these parameters, you will have different probabilities, right?

602
01:29:20,750 --> 01:29:30,260
If you consider that this is all come from a binomial random arrival with ten trials is having a success rate.

603
01:29:30,260 --> 01:29:34,280
P You could possibly have one of these outcomes, right?

604
01:29:35,030 --> 01:29:43,760
And the probability of having, let's say six successes out of ten trials from a binomial random variable,

605
01:29:44,060 --> 01:29:52,480
not as a probability of what kind should six times p6q for right.

606
01:29:55,550 --> 01:30:04,820
Edit Alternatively, if you think this is a result from a negative binomial trial where the parameter is six on p again P is a success rate.

607
01:30:05,060 --> 01:30:11,600
Six is a number of successes that I require. This can also be an outcome from that negative binomial.

608
01:30:12,170 --> 01:30:17,030
If that's the case, then the probability is what nine shows.

609
01:30:17,030 --> 01:30:20,900
What five to the P to the six.

610
01:30:21,230 --> 01:30:25,620
Q to the four. And these two, apparently, they are different.

611
01:30:25,710 --> 01:30:26,790
They have different consent.

612
01:30:27,090 --> 01:30:36,270
And the reason for that is really because if you give it a channel distribution, basically this is no longer the sequence itself.

613
01:30:38,280 --> 01:30:43,409
It's a representative of an equivalent class for the binomial distribution.

614
01:30:43,410 --> 01:30:48,540
What I represent is you have six successes out of ten trials.

615
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:57,420
This is just one representative. And so that's why you have these consent in front of the actual probabilities of the segments.

616
01:30:58,350 --> 01:31:04,680
Alternatively, if you assume this is the outcome from a negative binomial trial, now it's a representative.

617
01:31:04,740 --> 01:31:11,160
It's a representative of equivalent a clause where you have five successes of before.

618
01:31:11,160 --> 01:31:14,730
In a country you have you have ten trials.

619
01:31:15,090 --> 01:31:21,729
You are the guy who are number six successes. So that's why you have this non-interest.

620
01:31:21,730 --> 01:31:26,610
Fine. All right. So be very careful when calculating the probability.

621
01:31:26,960 --> 01:31:37,180
Whether it asks you to calculate the probability of a particular sequence or the probability or equivalent clause in a distribution,

622
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:41,750
it means different things. Right. And if.

623
01:31:41,790 --> 01:31:45,250
Question. Okay.

624
01:31:47,080 --> 01:31:54,129
All right. So here is another example for this next binomial classroom.

625
01:31:54,130 --> 01:31:58,420
We have two teams Detroit Tigers and Red Sox are playing in the World Series.

626
01:31:58,810 --> 01:32:04,000
The winning team is the one who is the first one to win four games.

627
01:32:04,720 --> 01:32:08,380
Suppose each game is in the Detroit Tigers.

628
01:32:08,770 --> 01:32:20,110
That's a success rate on AP. Then the question is what is the probability of the Detroit Tigers win the World Series?

629
01:32:21,320 --> 01:32:25,780
Okay, so the rule is the first one to win four games will win the game.

630
01:32:27,730 --> 01:32:32,290
So again, to answer this question three. What is a random variable?

631
01:32:32,620 --> 01:32:39,850
What is the distribution? How do you translate this problem into a calculated problem?

632
01:32:41,470 --> 01:32:46,390
So first question what is the one who would be a good run available to use in this case?

633
01:33:19,110 --> 01:33:22,530
So this problem, probably the first question is the hardest one.

634
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:32,490
If you said the run of our oil to be a good one, then the rest should be well follow through,

635
01:33:33,470 --> 01:33:38,040
right to think about what is changing what is random in this case.

636
01:33:42,710 --> 01:33:52,130
It's the number game. When you get your fourth win, the number of games where you get your fourth win, see what you want four times.

637
01:33:53,170 --> 01:33:56,620
Well, one of the teams you have to specify which one of the teams.

638
01:33:57,310 --> 01:33:59,740
That's the Detroit side. Very good.

639
01:34:00,250 --> 01:34:14,950
So we kind of set this as this random variable to be the number of games required for Detroit Tigers to win four games.

640
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:24,810
Okay. So that could be the running out of all the interest because once we have.

641
01:34:28,550 --> 01:34:32,450
We can we can all control which team actually win the ground series.

642
01:34:33,020 --> 01:34:47,570
But what we can do is to hypothetically allow this to two teams can claim a game until one of the teams, let's say in this case Detroit Tigers,

643
01:34:48,020 --> 01:34:56,840
win four games and we just record the total number of games played in order for the Detroit to win four games.

644
01:34:58,310 --> 01:35:06,560
All right. If we started this way now, we can say this act actually follows an active biomass distribution that we just introduced.

645
01:35:07,370 --> 01:35:10,370
Right. And every inductive binomial.

646
01:35:11,120 --> 01:35:17,630
And what are the parameters? What is the success rate? Well, this is a much easier question.

647
01:35:17,780 --> 01:35:25,250
What is the success rate in this trial? You'd be right, because that's the probability of Detroit winning a game.

648
01:35:27,110 --> 01:35:31,470
And what is the required success for?

649
01:35:33,110 --> 01:35:40,100
So that's why we require we have to run a variable to be the number of games required or data.

650
01:35:40,520 --> 01:35:52,700
Detroit Tigers to win four games. Even the Red Sox won the World Series, the total games and before Detroit went four games.

651
01:35:53,030 --> 01:35:57,860
We still hypothetical. We can assume they just kept playing until Detroit went four games.

652
01:35:58,220 --> 01:36:05,840
Right. And that way we can always set the run of our ball to be the number of games required to win four games.

653
01:36:06,320 --> 01:36:16,910
And we started our way. We got this nightmare binomial for p and lastly to translate this problem base event,

654
01:36:17,540 --> 01:36:30,290
the probability of Detroit Tigers to win a World Series that is equivalent to say what in terms of this run barrel, what does that mean?

655
01:36:34,460 --> 01:36:38,100
Have small rooms. It's very nice.

656
01:36:38,520 --> 01:36:41,730
Alex Lazare points out.

657
01:36:43,140 --> 01:36:55,670
Why is that? If it requires more than seven games for Detroit to win four games as Detroit's still have a chance to win the world championship?

658
01:36:57,320 --> 01:37:00,140
No. Right, because there are always two teams.

659
01:37:00,500 --> 01:37:12,260
If he requires eight games for Detroit, four, that means before the A's game, reality has already won at least four.

660
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:24,620
So the other team has already won. So the mass number, I say for this playoff, the max number of games that the two teams play is seven.

661
01:37:26,150 --> 01:37:31,550
Any order for the Detroit to when this card needs to be less or equal to seven?

662
01:37:32,840 --> 01:37:38,030
That is equivalent events with this Detroit win the World Series.

663
01:37:38,840 --> 01:37:49,160
Now the problem becomes given that is a doctor binomial with is parameters for and p was the probability of as last or equal to seven.

664
01:37:49,880 --> 01:37:58,190
That is something that is totally calculable, right? We know as a support of four, five, six, seven, etc.

665
01:37:58,460 --> 01:38:09,530
So that probability is just the probability at six or 5.6 and actually quite a seven.

666
01:38:10,260 --> 01:38:13,730
Okay. And it just plug in the formula to get the final results.

667
01:38:20,290 --> 01:38:24,879
Any question. Again.

668
01:38:24,880 --> 01:38:29,410
The same three steps. All right. Figure out what is that good rent available to use?

669
01:38:29,770 --> 01:38:36,910
What is the distribution point? And how do we translate the original event into something that I totally use in this roundabout?

670
01:38:41,290 --> 01:38:52,450
All right. Another example. Suppose a proportion of p of the population possess a certain characteristic or somehow a disease.

671
01:38:53,140 --> 01:38:58,990
How many people should we expect to sample in order to collect our people with that characteristic?

672
01:39:03,590 --> 01:39:10,460
So here we make the assumption that the population is large enough. So you can assume our sampling is essentially a sampling with replacement.

673
01:39:10,760 --> 01:39:18,560
In other words, each time you say independent sampling, you have the same probability of getting someone with the disease.

674
01:39:19,280 --> 01:39:26,060
So the problem is how many people should we expect to sample in order to get our people with disease?

675
01:39:28,340 --> 01:39:32,510
Again, three steps, right? First, start the random variable.

676
01:39:33,230 --> 01:39:39,140
So we in this case, we can set the variable to be one. It's all right.

677
01:39:39,200 --> 01:39:43,730
Stated in the problem. Write a number of people to sample.

678
01:39:48,200 --> 01:39:52,660
Forgot. Our. Is this.

679
01:39:53,390 --> 01:39:56,980
Is this. All right.

680
01:39:57,940 --> 01:40:02,690
But that's something that we are interested in. That would be our run of our own.

681
01:40:03,220 --> 01:40:06,970
And once we said that, we can say as follows.

682
01:40:07,240 --> 01:40:15,310
And actually, by normal distribution by definition. Okay. And we want to get our people with the disease.

683
01:40:15,520 --> 01:40:20,710
So that's one parameter. And the probability, the proportion of.

684
01:40:22,520 --> 01:40:29,030
Of people waste disease in the populations. So that's our success rate for each sample.

685
01:40:29,720 --> 01:40:35,000
So that gave us another parameter. So that defines a distribution for spread of animal.

686
01:40:35,390 --> 01:40:44,270
And finally, what do we care about it? Is the expectation on how many people we expect to sample in order to get so many successes?

687
01:40:44,990 --> 01:40:53,810
So that's the quantity of interesting expectation of X, which we know is our over.

688
01:40:54,980 --> 01:41:02,900
All right. That solve this question. A second question said ask how many should we sample?

689
01:41:02,920 --> 01:41:09,280
You are going to be 95% sure of getting our people with that characteristic.

690
01:41:09,730 --> 01:41:26,300
How do we translate that? Yes.

691
01:41:26,900 --> 01:41:37,970
So like the probability of x equals one plus probability equals to up until 95%.

692
01:41:40,160 --> 01:41:46,070
That's the idea. That's the correct idea. So in terms of the mathematical formula, how should we write?

693
01:41:47,060 --> 01:41:52,160
Actually, I write it down. What is the quantity of entries, let's say?

694
01:41:54,470 --> 01:41:58,340
How many? Right. Just how many we should sample.

695
01:41:58,940 --> 01:42:03,740
So let's say that's not a small y.

696
01:42:04,940 --> 01:42:08,900
So small y is what do we want it to go in number?

697
01:42:08,930 --> 01:42:13,009
Right. We want to evaluate what is small. Why is this small?

698
01:42:13,010 --> 01:42:19,610
What has to satisfy some criteria? The criteria is that with this sample size, small, white,

699
01:42:19,850 --> 01:42:33,180
we have 95% confidence that there are we are people with the characteristic that that translates to what the probability of acts.

700
01:42:43,120 --> 01:42:46,719
Right. The probability of our running back.

701
01:42:46,720 --> 01:42:50,830
I recall that our amount available is the number of people to a sample because

702
01:42:50,830 --> 01:42:57,760
it got our with disease occurrence loss high quality of this cut off why

703
01:42:58,180 --> 01:43:08,860
has 95% probably has 95% probability if that's the case now we have 95% of

704
01:43:08,860 --> 01:43:16,540
the confidence that with these many people we can have our with the disease.

705
01:43:19,300 --> 01:43:28,450
So you just need to plug in the city up and try to solve like, why is that satisfy this equation?

706
01:43:31,570 --> 01:43:35,680
And that sample size is the smaller sample size.

707
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:43,030
I give you a 95% confidence that you have our people with the disease because that makes sense.

708
01:43:44,920 --> 01:43:53,200
So that's the inverse problem. And and in this case, of course, there is no way that I can guarantee 100%.

709
01:43:54,950 --> 01:44:03,850
That's why the reason is that you can you know, you have to sample all the populations in order to to be wider percent sure.

710
01:44:05,800 --> 01:44:11,740
And mathematically, the reason is that it's not a binomial run available as infinite support.

711
01:44:12,370 --> 01:44:19,690
So no matter how large you are, cutoff is you can never make the left hand side equal to 100%.

712
01:44:22,150 --> 01:44:27,460
So that's a as a side note, any question with this problem?

713
01:44:29,530 --> 01:44:42,200
That's right. So the last well, last the second to the last situation that I want to introduce is this the hyper geometric distribution.

714
01:44:42,620 --> 01:44:53,330
And this is really to this order something wizards with mental experiments that we introduce in the counting process.

715
01:44:53,870 --> 01:44:56,960
Consider the following setup we have embossed in the earth.

716
01:44:57,790 --> 01:45:01,430
Our light bulbs and mice are the radicals.

717
01:45:02,330 --> 01:45:12,450
Any you random I draw balls without replacement round are the withdrawal small and balls from the end.

718
01:45:12,890 --> 01:45:16,070
And each ball has an equal probability being drawn.

719
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:28,360
And if you did no light to be the number of light balls air sample, then why is the rhinovirus right?

720
01:45:29,060 --> 01:45:42,400
So we can express this experimentally in this two by two table where you have wide force of a radicals and the balls can be sampled are now sample.

721
01:45:45,570 --> 01:45:58,140
So in total you have this hidden box. There have been white owned mines being red, and if you take a small samples from this are without replacement.

722
01:45:58,650 --> 01:46:05,450
So the remaining hem minus and is now sampling. So this quantity is what we call white oak.

723
01:46:06,120 --> 01:46:09,030
So the number of white balls in your samples.

724
01:46:10,640 --> 01:46:25,250
So this set out, first of all, let's see these three these three numbers are given the Catalan, Catalan and small and these three are prefixed.

725
01:46:26,120 --> 01:46:31,310
We know how many balls are there in total, how many are white in our red and how many.

726
01:46:31,700 --> 01:46:42,530
We want to sample with our replacement from the R and once we face all three, the only thing that can change is the number of white in the sample.

727
01:46:42,770 --> 01:46:47,150
Once this y is fixed, all of the three remaining cells are going to be fixed.

728
01:46:48,810 --> 01:46:55,400
Right. So the only thing that's changing that's possibly random in this experiment is this tattoo line.

729
01:46:57,260 --> 01:47:04,760
And that is all about a variable. All right. And in the sample, some small space for this line.

730
01:47:04,940 --> 01:47:15,730
It means that the smallest matter is the maximum of zero and her minus and minus M and the maximum value is minimal of small chemical.

731
01:47:16,250 --> 01:47:21,130
If you don't recall why we have this bone. Take a look at the previous note.

732
01:47:21,470 --> 01:47:29,960
Okay. We have derived this node, derived this that this sample space for this particular experiment set up.

733
01:47:31,370 --> 01:47:36,050
So this is the support for these right about here.

734
01:47:36,730 --> 01:47:40,900
Now, this is the experiment set up clear.

735
01:47:42,620 --> 01:47:47,260
All right. So now I know this random about this.

736
01:47:47,270 --> 01:47:54,260
This the y is a random variable, meaning it's random. Each time you repeat this process, they will repeat this experiment.

737
01:47:54,720 --> 01:48:00,590
You can have a different Y. All right. And now we can take anybody from this range.

738
01:48:02,270 --> 01:48:07,310
So the next question is, what is the plan for this friend of yours?

739
01:48:07,550 --> 01:48:16,040
For each fixed value in this wrench, what is the probability of your actual random variable taking that particular body?

740
01:48:17,090 --> 01:48:26,150
Let's say if you have a US in this range as a number, what is the probability of this y equal to us?

741
01:48:27,050 --> 01:48:33,320
What's the probability of a you actually have small as white balls in your sample?

742
01:48:35,090 --> 01:48:43,040
That is a well-defined question. Right? And we can exactly use the counting process to calculate that probability.

743
01:48:44,960 --> 01:48:49,580
So that's exactly how we're going to count the piano for this amount of our.

744
01:48:51,610 --> 01:48:56,930
In total there are and choose small and ways to get this small and samples from their.

745
01:48:58,030 --> 01:49:06,310
And the way to get this small ass wide is Amish without a modest twist and mindsets.

746
01:49:07,180 --> 01:49:16,360
And if you divide this quantity by these entries, then that give you exactly the probability of having small ass wide balls in this sample.

747
01:49:17,740 --> 01:49:24,600
And there is nothing new here. It is exactly the probability calculation that we have done before for these problems.

748
01:49:26,050 --> 01:49:26,370
Right.

749
01:49:26,680 --> 01:49:35,830
And that defines the piano for this random variable and for this random variable defined in this way, we call it a hyper geometric random variable.

750
01:49:37,750 --> 01:49:42,380
And for this case, it also does not have a quote on the net.

751
01:49:43,240 --> 01:49:48,520
So we're going to have to stop here today and we're going to continue and that's

752
01:49:48,520 --> 01:49:53,790
time to finish up the discrete random variable and move on to the because.
