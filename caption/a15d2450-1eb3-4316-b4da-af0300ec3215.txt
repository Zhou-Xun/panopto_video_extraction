1
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:14,230
Will. So we'll get started here.

2
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:20,829
Welcome, everybody. I'm Jeremy Taylor, and this is Cancer Biostatistics Seminar Services.

3
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:24,550
A seminar was run in the last 15 years.

4
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:33,930
Always 9:00 on Friday mornings and some. You know, guest speakers come in different, different sort of schedule each year and different set of topics.

5
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:40,620
And you take your student, you take the class again, you get credit for it once.

6
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:49,830
So as soon as I can recite, which hopefully you want to register registered, you can has access to this campus site.

7
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:56,220
So when I saw it, it wasn't really much of a moment, but I just spend about.

8
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:02,349
A very small amount of time just going through what's going to happen in the semester.

9
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:13,450
So each week will be a different speaker. The skipper is here this week and they'll present on something great working on some some research activity.

10
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:18,010
Sometimes I'll be a little more applied, sometimes I'll be a little more theoretical.

11
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:23,620
It's not intended to be sort of a comprehensive covering it sort of what are they working on?

12
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:27,399
Which seems interesting and appropriate for the audience here.

13
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:35,770
So the idea is you sort of get some exposure to the type of things statisticians who are involved in cancer research do.

14
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:41,499
And sometimes it'll be sort of more data analysis ish with sort of tricky methods.

15
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,860
So sometimes it'll be a little bit more development of the methods themselves.

16
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,840
It tends to be used in cancer.

17
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:53,870
And so you see there's a number of, you know, each week as a speaker and with more or less got the schedule filled as one open slot.

18
00:01:53,920 --> 00:02:06,200
So, so as you know, people from University of Michigan faculty here and students, there's some outside guests who come in to like guitar.

19
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:11,950
And so I think Matt today will mention Nomogram as well. Mike Tan is sort of a king of demographics.

20
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:12,860
And so anyway,

21
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:20,050
so there's a few guests coming in from the Cleveland Clinic and there's a few actually former students for someone who's been around a little bit.

22
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:23,110
Kangoo is a student who graduated a couple of years ago.

23
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:29,590
And. There is of a lot of people coming.

24
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:32,999
So you can see that. You can see the titles.

25
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,370
And then what I ask everyone to do is all the speakers to do is to send me information beforehand,

26
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:42,670
maybe a little bit of background reading of many slides too.

27
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:50,940
So sometimes it helps both of you potentially to look through the slides a little bit beforehand so you can catch on maybe a little quicker.

28
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:56,280
There was you know, some of the speakers will assume quite a bit of statistical knowledge,

29
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,239
which, you know, you know, all of you aren't going to have necessarily at this point in time.

30
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:09,410
So you looking ahead at the slides might help you a little bit to capture what we're trying to say better and for you,

31
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:12,950
whether you're taking it for credit because you know,

32
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:19,380
the requirements are basically attendance as was sign in sheet, which I'll try to remember to do each week.

33
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:24,060
And then two of the speakers, you'll get asked to write a short report.

34
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:29,250
So probably next next time I'll talk a little bit more about, you know.

35
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,640
And. What else? So today.

36
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,969
But I don't want to go too much into the details here.

37
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:41,970
But today, as I set right on campus, we announced grants of 10 to 1030.

38
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:48,740
If anyone has questions about the class, I'll be in my office attendance on from 10 to 1030 in a couple of minutes.

39
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:55,630
You know, whether it's going to work for you, potentially this class or anything else you might want to know.

40
00:03:57,490 --> 00:04:01,630
So anything else I should say? Questions people have at this point.

41
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:09,030
All right. So we're happy to have Matt Skipper here. Matt was actually a former student at Ms.

42
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:12,960
Department, so some great of a number of years ago.

43
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:24,600
And he's currently. Professor in radiation oncology, department of the medical school and in biostatistics, and his work with radiation oncology work.

44
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:28,310
And he's going to talk about the work he's done over the last few years.

45
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,530
And so over to you. All right.

46
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:36,900
Thank you for the invite. It's great to be here. You've all chosen a great seminar to take on.

47
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:40,520
I still remember some of the talks.

48
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,890
Just you. Suspend your.

49
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:53,430
Unfortunately. So I still remember some of the talks I heard here too long ago.

50
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,990
In fact, you know, Elizabeth may show you next week, you know, some spectrograms.

51
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:03,569
And I remember a talk that somebody from I don't know what department one of the speech department stand by was that gave,

52
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:10,680
you know ten or 15 years ago showing pictograms and how they are not quantitative people retain understand

53
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,400
those and better than you know kaplan-meier curves or things that a statisticians might prefer.

54
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:21,040
So today I'll be talking about it's a fairly applied project in some ways a fairly standard prediction problem, but it has, you know,

55
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:29,220
a couple of sort of ways to ask for certain novel aspects, some interesting results, lots of statistical content, not too many equations.

56
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:37,020
Apologies in advance if you're hoping for a lot of the equations. But the topic I'll be talking about is developing a staging system and path here.

57
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:44,010
And Jeremy reminded me I should make sure you realize that's not a path as in a trail through the words, it's pathology.

58
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:48,419
So it's surgery, but it's all to find more of what I mean about that.

59
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:53,700
So a staging system for men with prostate cancer. So I just want to do this upfront, make sure I don't forget this.

60
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:58,320
Almost everything I'll be showing you today was work done by Theresa DeFazio.

61
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:08,520
She was a student here and graduated a year ago. She's an investigator, I think is her title at NCI now and an amazing student and a great colleague.

62
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:15,080
So she did essentially 90% of the work of what I'll be showing then is is also joint work with Ellen Sun,

63
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:20,850
now at case western critic who's now a back a professor here and then some amazing clinicians as well.

64
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:27,180
Bob just did a lot of the legwork in terms of putting this collaboration together and cleaning data and,

65
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:32,370
you know, answering all of our questions clinical and well, Jaxon and Dan spread out over the issues.

66
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:36,560
So give you some background that I think is important here,

67
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:41,809
described as very briefly the dataset we have and then talk about building the staging system and models,

68
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:45,950
how we evaluate them and finish with a few conclusions. So please stop me during this.

69
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:51,130
I think I only have about 25 slides, so I think there should be plenty of time if something's not clear.

70
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:56,640
If you have questions as I go along, just stop me at any point. So by way of background.

71
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:06,049
So for more than six decades now, the American Joint Committee on Cancer, CC has grouped patients by stage of disease.

72
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:11,280
So in stages, typically number one through four, stage four is typically metastatic.

73
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,659
That means that cancer is spread, metastasized outside of its primary site.

74
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,930
So if you have liver cancer and then it spreads to your liver metastatic.

75
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:20,250
So that tends to be stage four.

76
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:28,079
And the categorizations have been based on sort of anatomy, the extent of the tumor involved locally, that's the T stage or T category.

77
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,010
So see in my new staging system is using T stage.

78
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:34,379
That's how big the primary tumor is.

79
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:42,690
And so how you quantify that varies if you're talking about lung cancer, prostate or breast or other things, that's the T stage or T category.

80
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:48,959
Whether it's spread to nearby lymph nodes, it's often the first place cancer spreads through the lymphatic system.

81
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:55,110
And so that's the end stage and category. And then has it spread distantly metastasis up the stage?

82
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:02,190
And so for prostate cancer, non anatomical factors like we send out a little bit later.

83
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:13,319
But what I mean by that PSA probably familiar with or incorporated into the staging and most other staging systems until recently,

84
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:17,700
we're still just based on TNM M and then you combine those into the what's called a group stage.

85
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:23,040
So, you know, it may be, you know, a family member who then stage two breast cancer or lung cancer or something,

86
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:29,660
that's a group stage and that's based on some combination of the T and numbers.

87
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:34,680
So prostate cancer remains one of the few for which these sorts of stage groupings

88
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:38,579
have not been adopted in national guidelines or the design of clinical trials.

89
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:43,049
So you don't hear people talk much about stage the prostate cancer.

90
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:46,890
You may hear them talk about favorable intermediate resting groups.

91
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:55,100
And so there's some, you know, and this four groupings that endorsed by HCC that clinicians tend to use to.

92
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:03,139
So in I guess six years ago this the agency adopted a strategy that said we need to incorporate more advanced

93
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:08,810
statistical models to make certain that part of this to better personalize sort of diagnostic estimates.

94
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:15,980
So they had this committee that established criteria for what, you know, a good personalized prognostic model shouldn't look like.

95
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:21,590
So, for example, one of the criteria was you should have a survival outcome if possible, it should be cancer specific survival.

96
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:27,580
So the thing you're predicting should be your risk of dying of your cancer or perhaps overall survival.

97
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:33,440
You should not model things if possible, like time to what's called biochemical recurrence or PSA rise.

98
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,160
You shouldn't even necessarily model time to your cancer progresses.

99
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:42,170
You should model survival for these purposes. So they you know, and there's you know,

100
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:49,400
there's been many models here in this space that have been published that evaluated 15 at the time, and none of them met their criteria.

101
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:55,640
So either they hadn't been externally validated or they didn't model survival or there is something else sort of wrong with them.

102
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:02,600
And so in the current AGC decision, they put out what used to be these big books, and so they were on the eighth edition.

103
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:07,760
And so they had no statistical models for prostate cancer in the in the eighth edition.

104
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:11,500
And so the eighth edition is essentially based on expert opinion.

105
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:15,709
They convened a panel of experts, you know, ten people in a room, some surgeons,

106
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:20,600
some radiation oncologist, medical oncologist, and they put together a staging system.

107
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:26,989
And I mean, I'll show you. It actually does quite well. Obviously, they're relying on a lot of data, analyzes a lot of papers,

108
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:31,550
but I think they put together a system that actually works quite well, but it's not really used.

109
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:36,680
That's one of the issues. Okay. So just very briefly, this has got a lot of text.

110
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:39,470
And I was I think it's helpful to know the clinical setting here.

111
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:45,530
So typically what the precursor to being diagnosed with prostate cancer is rising PSA or other tests.

112
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:53,270
But something prompts you to go in. Your oncologist will recommend to biopsy the biopsy, take a little bit of tissue.

113
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,959
PSA becomes a PSA specific antigen.

114
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:05,270
It's it's a biomarker. It's produced by the prostate. And so when it starts to rise, that can indicate you had a prostate cancer.

115
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:13,610
Lab test. Blood test? Yes. Yeah. So you have you have you present there some other way you go and you get a

116
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:18,560
biopsy that may lead to a cancer diagnosis or not if you have prostate cancer.

117
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:24,650
And then you will get what's clinical staging. So that's what critics of stress develop.

118
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:28,309
So this is sort of a different setting today. So that's clinical staging.

119
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:34,490
Same idea you want to use, you have different variables and then that leads to some clinical decisions.

120
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:39,110
So in terms of treatment, so lower risk men are currently recommended to get this active surveillance.

121
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:43,660
So come in once a year, get your PSA measure and or maybe get a biopsy every other year or something like that.

122
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:47,360
But know if you're a little higher risk, you might get surgery or radiation.

123
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:52,339
If you're a higher risk, you may add hormone therapy to radiation. So that's sort of the treatment decision.

124
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:55,700
Then you're followed you're followed with your PSA measured.

125
00:11:55,700 --> 00:12:00,470
You may have imaging and other sorts of follow up the endpoints.

126
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:04,069
The common ones are biochemical, recurrent. So that's rising PSA.

127
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:08,630
So after surgery or hormone therapy, your PSA will come down to close to zero or zero.

128
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:12,860
And then at some point two years later, 20 years later, it may start to rise.

129
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:19,790
And so that's called biochemical recurrence. So that's relatively common in this population, but not particularly meaningful.

130
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:23,959
So biochemical recurrence has been shown actually not to be a surrogate end point in the setting.

131
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:32,000
So it doesn't treatments that impact reduce your risk of biochemical recurrence may not and often do not increase your survival.

132
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,970
They may not decrease the risk of your cancer metastasized and so distant metastases is much less common,

133
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:42,410
but it is sort of a hard and clinically meaningful endpoint. I won't really show you these results.

134
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:47,030
And then what what we call them prostate cancer, specific mortality.

135
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:53,420
That's the time to death from your prostate cancer. That's what we'll be modeling today.

136
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:59,330
And so anything that's related. So typically Sam is preceded by distant match.

137
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:05,790
So if your cancer metastasizes, then you die. And that would be scarring is sort of the cause of death would be prostate cancer.

138
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:13,410
There's some ambiguity in messiness and how, you know, cause of death, it's in clinical trials.

139
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:18,540
It tends to be known a little better because you're following these patients and you may have a better sense for, okay, they died.

140
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:21,659
But, you know, there are certainly patients who die. And it's a little unclear.

141
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:26,399
They they had just met six months before, but they died, you know, they had a heart attack.

142
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,430
And there's there's not always entirely clear conflict.

143
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:35,960
Um, so our group had previously published a clinical staging system, so that's before you get surgery.

144
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:39,270
It gives a stage if you want to take a look.

145
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:43,930
That's a star, cam, dawg. You can go. There is a little app that will show you those results.

146
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:47,860
The current project is only for patients who got surgery.

147
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:53,050
Then after surgery, have some new variables that you didn't know before. So things like locally how big was the tumor?

148
00:13:53,320 --> 00:14:00,070
Had a spread outside of the prostate, things like extra capillary extension and did it invade the seminal vesicle,

149
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:03,780
some extra variables that you don't have clinically.

150
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:10,660
So the goal here was to build a prognostic staging system for men who had undergone surgery.

151
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:18,479
So the goal was to accurately predict peak season and then sort of improve on the current staging system and also meet

152
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:24,860
those criteria set forth by the Precision Medicine Committee so that hopefully that system would be adopted by CC.

153
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:27,210
And there, you know, whenever the ninth edition comes out.

154
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:34,950
So we had I'm going to gloss over lots of details here, but, you know, we had about 27,000 patients here and a very large cohort.

155
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:40,709
So that was great. So we chose to split them 2 to 1 into training and validation.

156
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:47,940
So we sent the clinicians, you know, 27,000 wrote, you know, column of yes and training validation.

157
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,790
They sorted in Excel and sent us 18,000 training patient rows.

158
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:59,010
So that's what I'll be showing today. We have not yet sort of, you know, broken the lock and looked at in validation.

159
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:04,740
That's sort of the ultimate test for this is that this project took much longer, like, like most projects do then.

160
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:11,219
And I think many of us anticipated choices when graduated for a year now, and we had hoped to more or less have this wrapped up when she graduated.

161
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:16,840
But it's coming along. I think it's it's close to done and. So actually just one case.

162
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:20,240
So this is one statistical decision you make, right? How do you do 2 to 1 split?

163
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:28,920
Do you do 1 to 1? And so that those statistical principles at play here, I think it tends to take more data to build a model than to evaluate a model,

164
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:32,130
to estimate parameters, to be variable selection, all of those sorts of decisions.

165
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:36,900
So that's why sort of a bigger training set and a smaller validation set.

166
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:44,780
I think if we had not wanted to evaluate model performance in some subgroups, we might have done something like 3 to 1 or 5 to 1,

167
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:49,939
even if it were just the only validation we wanted to do was an overall validation of the entire cohort.

168
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:57,040
We might have made this to some degree, but we wanted to see how does it perform in intermediate risk and how does it perform in black men?

169
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:01,100
And so yeah, that's kind of where we ended up with a 2 to 1 split.

170
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:09,020
Okay, so all the variables we have available Gleason score, primary and secondary.

171
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:15,860
So when you get a biopsy and then in this case when you get surgery, you have tissue from the prostate, you might have multiple slices of it.

172
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:21,169
The pathologists will look at that tissue and and rate rate it on some scale.

173
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:25,340
How cancer like is it versus how normal prostate tissue is?

174
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:33,130
And so they will give those different patterns within that tissue and they will rate those on a three, four or five scale just what they do.

175
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,349
So the most common pattern can be a three or four or five.

176
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:42,989
That's primary Gleason. And then parts of the slide they look at or parts of the tissue may have some other pattern.

177
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:46,770
What's the secondary? Second, most common pattern, that sort of secondary Gleason.

178
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:53,760
So for many years people would just add these up. And so if your primary was four and secondary was three, you'd say your Gleason seven.

179
00:16:55,020 --> 00:17:00,239
I think, you know, many groups have shown that, you know, there's a little more information in it that you lose and you just add them up.

180
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,960
And so we'll be treating these in several different, different patterns.

181
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:12,600
Key stage is just, again, how big the tumor is locally within the prostate I'm going to detail, but that the discrete levels we have are t two.

182
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:20,969
So the P here is just part of T two as opposed to clinical T to which you would estimate from imaging or sometimes from a rectal exam or something.

183
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:27,110
So what used for ordinal levels to t stage we have from end stage is just yes.

184
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:31,649
No, it's not very common in this setting for these patients to have cancer in their lungs.

185
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:36,510
No. And still spread. And I should say also that this is localized prostate cancer.

186
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:40,920
So we're not dealing with anyone who has metastatic cancer. It's sort of a different clinical setting.

187
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:45,480
And if it spreads to the lymph nodes, it's still considered localized.

188
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:52,030
This is surgery. So the surgeons will take out the prostate and then they also have some choice to,

189
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:55,299
you know, take nearby lymph nodes and you have lots of nearby lymph nodes.

190
00:17:55,300 --> 00:18:01,750
And so there's a lot of variation between surgeons. Do I take out the closest to do I take out 25?

191
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:05,229
There's a lot of you know, certain centers just have certain practices.

192
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:08,559
I don't we do extensive one follow lymph node dissection that's called.

193
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:12,640
And so anyway, this variable is how many lymph nodes did I take out?

194
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:15,910
And then of those, whatever that is the number 120.

195
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:19,510
How many were positive for cancer? Each one gets evaluated for cancer.

196
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:24,700
So those are two variables. You could take the ratio, you could I'll show you what we ended up using.

197
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:31,659
But margin positive is, you know, they take out some chunk of tissue and then they look at the edge of it and the sort of the outermost edge.

198
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:38,680
Is there cancer in. And that's sort of a bad thing. So if you have because what that means is probably the bit you left in May also have cancer.

199
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:45,280
So that's just a yes or no variable patient age sometimes is thought to be in PSA is or the

200
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,989
preoperative PSA sorry two other variables that I'll talk to us a little bit about treatment year.

201
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:54,490
So the original dataset we had men who were treated back in the early nineties

202
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:59,500
and then all the way through 2012 or something and then treatment center.

203
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,079
So the staging system, this is sort of the you know,

204
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:07,430
the requirements we were given by the clinicians when we did this for the clinical staging system.

205
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:11,270
I sort of argued it, but I don't know here I can see some value in this.

206
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:20,020
So what they want is a mapping from some combination of those clinical variables to at most a nine level ordinal stage variable.

207
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:25,540
So typically stage is one A, one B, one C to A to B, juicy and so on.

208
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:29,050
So no D's and No. Four, because four is reserved for metastatic so.

209
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:34,420
We have, as importantly, is, you know, ten variables that we can use any or all of them in any way.

210
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:38,770
We need to map that to essentially number one through nine or stage one through three.

211
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:43,500
And that mapping should not require a computer or our shiny app or anything else.

212
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:48,660
I want something that's just easy to use. So it's hard to use a computer for that much.

213
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:54,810
No, I don't think it's so much acquisition that you knew about because they are in some settings.

214
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:59,910
I think some of the reasons are that you have a continuous model when you when you get out, you get.

215
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:06,129
So how do so you think of some of the things they want to use this for our just sort of grouping

216
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:12,270
up the enrollment in clinical trials you could say from this model published by Sprout at all.

217
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:17,860
I'm going to take this ten year, Sam, and if that's less than 6%, then you're eligible for this trial.

218
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:24,780
That's a little off. Or they would rather decide this trial enroll intermediate and high risk patients meeting stage two or higher.

219
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:28,650
And so I think that's some of the rationale for this.

220
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:33,659
I think the field is certainly moving towards this. We all had phones that you have a web app.

221
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:40,320
You type in these six numbers and out you get a predicted risk or a number, but I don't think it's quite there yet.

222
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:45,950
So given these requirements, here's three options we could think of and there's probably more.

223
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:52,050
So one is a survival trait. I'll show you an example. One is a Nomi gram and one is a points based table.

224
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:56,700
So here's just one example. This is in brain cancer glioblastoma, I believe.

225
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,889
I don't work much in this area anymore.

226
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:07,460
But when I used to you know this they call RPA recursive partitioning analysis is very is used widely in brain cancer at least it was.

227
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:11,670
And so the idea is every patient enters up at the time and then you have splits.

228
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:13,889
And so if your age is less than 50, you go this way.

229
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:20,160
And then if your performance ends at some measure of, you know, how do you have trouble getting out of bed?

230
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:23,310
Can you move around? Fine. Can you get in the car and drive things like that?

231
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:29,500
If that's greater than 90, then you're stage three or RPA group three, and each patient right gets factored down.

232
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,900
These are called terminal nodes.

233
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:36,930
So every patient you can very quickly, just visually, you could have this printed out and you can look and say all your RPA Class five.

234
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:44,099
And then you could do a kaplan-meier curve of sound to everyone that ends up in this category.

235
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:48,960
So this has a few advantages. It's easy to use and sort of visually attractive.

236
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:55,200
It's good at identifying interactions. So for example, you know, mental status you see here,

237
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,380
it seems to matter for patients that get brains this way, but you don't see mental status over here.

238
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:04,140
So that's sort of indicative of some statistical interaction between mental status and some of these other variables.

239
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:14,910
If effects are sort of steeply sigmoid or threshold like this, obviously does that well because it has two threshold variables.

240
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:20,910
So if age less than 50 is 49 is really different than 51, then this will be great.

241
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:24,430
If if age is more of a smooth effect on outcome, this won't be so great.

242
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:29,400
And so it's good identifying interactions, threshold effects, and it's visually attractive.

243
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:32,820
And the downside is it doesn't tend to do well prediction wise.

244
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:36,780
And so we did actually evaluate this estimate. So she made a survival rate.

245
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:44,790
And, you know, it looks nice, but it's, you know, it definitely has inferior predictive performance in other examples and no.

246
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:48,350
MG So this is like generally saying my cation has done a bunch of these I.

247
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:54,740
So this is the way this works. So from here, you know, PSA down through secondary Gleason are variables you have.

248
00:22:55,040 --> 00:23:03,769
So for every variable, so this extra capsule, extra capsular extension, I'll say that we're not you know,

249
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:07,399
if you're a yes, you go up here to this points thing and say, okay, you get 25 points.

250
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:12,799
If you're a yes, if you're a no, you get zero points. Positive search emerging and I'm say positive.

251
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:18,200
Yes again. Okay. You get seven points anyway for each variable for a given patient, you go through and say, how many points do you get?

252
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,830
You just add up the points and you know, let's say your total points are 50,

253
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:27,620
then you've come down to the bottom zeros and let's say your total points are 150.

254
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:33,530
That's here. And then you visually or vertically line that up with this predicted 15 year fixed and

255
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:41,359
say okay my for this patient is 15 your CSM risk is somewhere between 0.1 and .05.03,

256
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:46,580
let's say. So. You know, people publish a lot of these.

257
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:56,420
It's sort of the idea of putting a model on paper. It doesn't give you it doesn't convert directly to some absolute risk, which is good.

258
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:00,800
And I think people almost ever use these, though, in practice.

259
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,980
I mean, it takes a bit of mental effort. You've got eight different rows each one.

260
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:10,700
You're like literally taking out a sheet of paper and lining it up. And it seems really odd to be doing something like this in 2022.

261
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:17,450
So I didn't want to do this approach. We will come up with a continuous model and it'll be a shiny app and it'll be easy to

262
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:21,380
use and you'll type in seven things and within 30 seconds you will get all probably,

263
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:27,350
you know, peaks and risk over time. I don't think there's any reason to use one of these necessarily.

264
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:32,270
Just some opinion. Mike has come in. You can ask Mike on these.

265
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:40,610
I think that, you know, they were well intentioned, right. Like before shiny apps were widely available and people carried phones around and such.

266
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:44,170
You know, this was a good way to not just give you a stage like three eight,

267
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:47,740
but say, okay, what is your 15 year absolute risk of dying of your prostate cancer?

268
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:52,900
I think in that setting, goals are valuable. Okay. So our strategy we chose was.

269
00:24:54,560 --> 00:25:01,820
For the staging system to develop sort of a points based system, a bit like the NOMOGRAM, but without the points linkage with the P.C.C.

270
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:06,350
So in some way like that, like the NOMOGRAM, but just a little simpler in some ways.

271
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:12,840
So the primary outcome, again, is time to death from prostate cancer. Competing risk here is other cause mortality.

272
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:15,560
So Elizabeth will talk, I think, much more about this next week.

273
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:22,320
So most of these men are much more likely to die of some heart attack or stroke or something else than they are to die of their prostate cancer.

274
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:26,720
Not not all of them, but the vast majority are. So that's an important factor here.

275
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:31,910
How do you handle, you know, when you're doing data analysis and someone died of a heart attack seven years after treatment,

276
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:36,409
do you treat that the same as someone who moved to Florida and was lost to follow

277
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:40,550
up or someone who was treated seven years ago and you administratively sunset,

278
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:46,700
you treat it different. So we chose to treat it differently as a competing risk.

279
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:52,460
So if you have other cause mortality, you not only did you not have peaks in the interval, but you never could have had a.

280
00:25:54,380 --> 00:26:00,430
And in addition, we wanted to develop this to, you know, modern statistical models that you could implement in a web app.

281
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:03,769
So one would be a sort of a semi parametric model. It's fine.

282
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:09,829
And gray is the type of model you can use when you have competing risk in this model would allow

283
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:14,479
for sort of nonlinear effects interactions potentially and then some more machine learning,

284
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:22,459
sort of more non parametric flavor of a model. We tried both random survival forest and also survival our Bayesian adaptive regression trees.

285
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:27,050
It's a sort of machine learning technique that seems to have a lot of promise in this setting.

286
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:32,030
It didn't seem to help much over random survival for us and it was computationally very difficult.

287
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:38,600
We had to take st we couldn't fit 18,000 patients at once because we had other stuff and so we ended up dropping that, but.

288
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,870
How to handle the other variables. So race we explicitly did not want in the model.

289
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:48,900
I think for lots of good reasons. But we did want to evaluate the performance of the model in some groups.

290
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:55,360
I'll show you a little bit of the center. So we had eight different centers represented or we thought we would just so we had done a

291
00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:00,990
statistical analysis plan before we got the data just to sort of make this a bit user center.

292
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,050
We just sort of tested is there a center level effect? And we actually didn't see that.

293
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:09,640
I'm not sure exactly what we would have done if we had seen in our Mayo Clinic.

294
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:15,850
Patients always do better or worse. But. And then year turns out to be something that's actually important.

295
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:20,070
So when was a patient treated come back to us.

296
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:28,000
Okay. So, you know, you don't have sort of co-morbidity variables in here which would impact the other cause of death.

297
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,030
And so I know you're interested in as well.

298
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:36,850
Very much so. You'll hear all about that next week. So we in this dataset, we don't they don't capture co-morbidities.

299
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:40,330
And we are in the process of applying to energy.

300
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:44,379
This National Cooperative Group for data from bunch of their trials where they actually captured the patient

301
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:48,400
have diabetes if they have a history of stroke and some other things that impact other cause mortality.

302
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:53,229
But Elizabeth Talk next week I think will be much more interesting than mine, both in mine.

303
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:59,320
I'll set hers up a little bit. So she has she'll show you models for other cause mortality and how you can think about combining those are

304
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:04,360
the models for prostate cancer mortality and and how it impacts the risk of prostate cancer mortality.

305
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:09,260
So we had originally 21,000 patients in our training set.

306
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:16,550
Median follow up six years and 340 of these men, we observed their death time due to prostate cancer.

307
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:23,360
You know 4000 patients with more than ten years of follow ups early impressive data set that way large lots of follow up,

308
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:27,499
plenty of events, remodeling, you know, no excuses from the statisticians that we don't have enough, you know,

309
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:31,100
events, remodeling, given the site, you know, we have ten ish variable.

310
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:37,549
So what I'll end up showing you is as results only in men treated in 2000 or later.

311
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:41,450
So so something we identified kind of late I'll come back to whatever that was, 18,000 men.

312
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:49,069
So not a huge reduction in sample size, but a big drop in number of some events from so these 3000 guys treated in the nineties.

313
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:54,709
You know, we observed a lot of CSM events in those men in some cohorts here.

314
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:59,150
It's a big score for Mayo and some other ones, some Italian and German Cleveland Clinic.

315
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:06,760
So a nice, nice sort of diverse dataset in many ways. So I thought we were nearly done with this.

316
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:09,669
And we're in the process of thought. We were done with the staging system.

317
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:13,989
We were looking at sort of the continuous fine and great regression model and trace.

318
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:17,940
I was looking at interactions, you know, or any significant and you know,

319
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:24,490
she sent me results in the most significant in a pairwise interaction was actually Gleason score with year of treatment

320
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:29,920
which is sort of inconvenient because you don't want to have a year in a staging system like that's awkward or it doesn't.

321
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:39,290
So, you know, she made this plot then of hazard ratios of Gleason over a calendar year of treatment.

322
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:43,700
So the reference group here is Gleason six men in 1993.

323
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:46,310
So that's right here. That's a hazard ratio and that's the reference.

324
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:53,450
Everything else here is hazard ratios for either Gleason six patients over time compared to Gleason six.

325
00:29:53,450 --> 00:30:00,920
So everything else compared to Gleason six patients in 1993. So what you see is over time, Gleason six patients and this is, you know,

326
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:04,999
accounting for everything else, PSA, age, stage margin, positive, everything else.

327
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:13,399
So all else being equal, a Gleason six patients treated in 2005 have a far lower risk of seven and Gleason

328
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:17,719
six patients back in the nineties and then you see other trends so you know,

329
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:24,140
relat, you know, even within sort of the worst prognosis patients this purple curve are Gleason five type patients right there.

330
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:32,530
Their risk is actually prognostic early. Being Gleason Pattern five is much worse in 2012 than it was in 93.

331
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:37,080
So this is not just sort of a marginal time effect that I'll talk through.

332
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:41,060
How I think we know how to handle this is sort of saying the impact of Gleason itself.

333
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:44,130
How many points should you give to Gleason is changing a lot over time.

334
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:51,360
And so there's some reason for this, how they do the biopsy, how the pathologists rate the, you know, the slides and so on, actually not biopsy.

335
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:55,500
These are surgery specimens. But anyway, there's some reason for this.

336
00:30:56,970 --> 00:31:06,460
So this was anyway, so what we ended up deciding to do for purposes of the staging system was only analyze man treated in 2000 or later.

337
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:11,190
So after 2000, you know, there's still some change. You don't see any of the curves crossing.

338
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:14,930
I think some of the biggest drop, like one of the big changes was Gleason six men.

339
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:20,759
They're modern men who are Gleason six almost never die of their prostate cancer,

340
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:25,420
so they no longer get treated with surgery or radiation and even and they do very, very well.

341
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:29,999
So after 2000 things, luckily is a bit more stable. So that's a decision we made here.

342
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:37,649
But it's one of those things maybe if we done more exploratory data analysis early that we would have discovered, but we found this out, I don't know,

343
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:44,670
was a few months ago and a lot of back and forth on how to handle it so the results will be showing you are limited to men were treated in

344
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:53,340
2000 or later you know so you next the model and it will have categorizations of some of these continuous variables like age and PSA and etc.

345
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:57,750
So lots of sort of exploratory data analysis and to sort of say.

346
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:05,330
Where should we then say? Right. So in general, when you've been something, you to lose information, you're going to have less efficient estimates.

347
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:09,530
But for a person, a staging system, you have to been given the criteria.

348
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:14,400
You want a mapping to this discrete nine level stage variable.

349
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:20,639
So, you know, things like this. So you split a gender in deciles or something and you plot to make plots like this or

350
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:25,590
you do regression splints to sort of look at is there some sort of nonlinear factor?

351
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:30,180
You know, when does risk seem to increase most rapidly? Okay.

352
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:37,979
So here is the final, final gray regression model that underlies the staging system.

353
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:47,430
I'll show you next. So your t stage here, so t to the lowest risk is a reference and you know, t three.

354
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:53,250
So these are hazard ratios, subdistribution hazard ratios, because we're treating them as a competing risk.

355
00:32:55,110 --> 00:33:05,339
So relative to t to patients, patients are t3a have a double double the risk of disease g3b or t four have four or five times the risk.

356
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:14,250
These hazard ratios are fairly large. Gleason The Gleason six what I'm referring to is three and three, primary is three and in secondary is three.

357
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:21,720
And you see some groupings here that trace it out again, sort of exploratory data analysis to say where should five plus three go?

358
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:25,799
Should I go down here by the three plus five? Should it go up here?

359
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:31,830
And so a lot of, you know, analysis behind the scenes here that came up with these groupings and thresholds of PSA.

360
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:36,809
We chose to be at 20 so that this is a results.

361
00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:40,799
You can see, you know, the largest hazard ratios are for Gleason. That's what really drives a lot of this.

362
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:47,070
So relative to the Gleason, six guys, you know, if you have any pattern five, primary pattern five.

363
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:53,640
So if your primary Gleason is five, that's as high as gross. You know, you have 200 times the risk of the Gleason six many.

364
00:33:55,560 --> 00:34:02,820
Number. No, it's positive. Again we worked a lot of you know is a percent positive does that is that notes it's positive sort

365
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:08,280
of some interaction with number removed and really ultimately it seemed to be simpler than that.

366
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,139
It just seemed to be. Did you have any positive?

367
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:16,710
So it's a little hard to know like how, you know, there's some randomness, I think to surgeons, you know, how many variables they decide to take out.

368
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:21,780
But there's probably some information in it to they tend to know, have some ability to discern, you know,

369
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:26,730
which nodes are higher risk or which patients should I take more nodes out and things like that.

370
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:37,290
So this is the model. Yeah. You no age, you just showed us age before, but you did include margins which has like no information.

371
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:38,850
It's useless, right? More or less.

372
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:46,260
And, you know, the surgeons don't like and they kind of insisted you put in margins despite the fact that it is useless.

373
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:50,580
Well. Well, I'll show you. This is. Yeah, I.

374
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:56,290
Forgetting why age is not age probably should have been in this model.

375
00:34:58,270 --> 00:35:05,440
I don't know that. I don't know the answer why he doesn't care. But this was sort of all of the potential variables we put in at one time.

376
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:11,229
Yeah. That no they didn't insist we put it in the model. I mean we did here just to see does it matter from this.

377
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:14,440
And we develop a points based system and some of these things will follow, as you'll see.

378
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:23,079
We looked at interactions and kind of, you know, they seemed to provide some small improvement potentially,

379
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:26,559
but it was very small on the clinicians and nothing else worth the added complexity.

380
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:30,190
And, you know, a staging system where you have to say, well, you don't just add up a series of points.

381
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:33,219
How many points you get for a Gleason depends on whether you're margin positive.

382
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:36,460
Things like that for the staging system wanted something simpler.

383
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:40,180
Okay. So even though we have these, you know, we've categorized variables, right?

384
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:43,719
We group Gleason or we said PSA is either bigger than 20 or less than 20.

385
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:48,940
So still is not a staging system. Right. You can't this doesn't map to a number one through nine.

386
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:59,139
So how do you do that? So how we did it was to divide these log hazard ratios in this column by some number and then around to the nearest integer.

387
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:05,610
And that would be your sort of points. So lots of things we tried here again are know sort of back and forth.

388
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:12,330
We ended up dividing by log up two so one night and then round to the nearest integer.

389
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:14,280
So I show you that. So then in that setting,

390
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:21,689
each one point you get roughly corresponds to a doubling of the same results or exponential at the log hazard ratio and hazard ratio.

391
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:29,999
So if it's log two, you get a doubling. I said, okay, so this is what that looks like if you can do that.

392
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:35,640
So if you take .82 and you divide by log of two and you round you round to one,

393
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:42,059
but if you take 1.6 and divide my log of two and round you round to two.

394
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:46,560
And so these are now the points that correspond to each of these levels.

395
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,040
So this leads to some further grouping, right?

396
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:56,970
So T, three, B and T for both give you the same number of points, even though in the model they were different hazard ratios.

397
00:36:56,970 --> 00:37:01,350
When you round you, obviously there's some coarsening that goes on, some things fall out.

398
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:06,659
So like margin positivity like James scoring, the hazard ratios teeny and so on each round it is rounds to zero.

399
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:10,110
So what that means is margin positivity status falls out of the staging system.

400
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:18,069
PSA level does as well and an age did too I know have to look why we don't

401
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:24,070
have age so this is then the final what we are proposing as a staging system.

402
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:28,270
So there's only three variables surprisingly out of know the seven or something we could

403
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:32,979
have chosen from so there's t stage with three levels and Gleason with six levels.

404
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:40,630
And then just a note positivity with two. And so that points a patient wouldn't get you would just simply add three numbers up.

405
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:45,350
So 0 to 2. And so this is the type of thing you can do. At one point we were dividing by.

406
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:50,690
How something other than log two and you had some numbers in the teens here like the biggest

407
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:55,110
number of 17 and started to get is that something you just quickly do on your head?

408
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:59,989
It's a lot of back and forth. The clinicians are that the goal is to make this useful, something that people actually use.

409
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:04,040
And I think something, you know, busy clinicians, you know,

410
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:08,479
you have to make it easy that something's hard or difficult to do is just not going to get to you.

411
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:15,110
So this is a staging system. Now there's a whole nother thing, you know, when you divide by log two and you do that,

412
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:17,790
you don't know what's the maximum total number of points you can get.

413
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:21,299
Well, it turns out the total number of points you get here is two plus eight plus one.

414
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:24,480
So 11. But you can also someone who is zero.

415
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:28,020
So now you have a 12 level staging system. We only want nine levels.

416
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:36,640
So there is this necessary step of doing some grouping. So we shows in group that 0 to 2 and 3 to 4 and then everything else zero.

417
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:45,520
If you have 0 to 2 points, you're stage one and so on. So you can see that distribution of risk is heavily skewed to the low risk side.

418
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:50,660
Very few men percentagewise who are, you know, stage three, for example.

419
00:38:51,350 --> 00:38:54,830
And that's sort of consistent with a generally good prognosis, prostate cancer patients.

420
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:59,080
So how are we in time with. 10 minutes.

421
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:06,490
12 minutes. Okay. I have to speed up this look. These are cumulative incidence estimates for the nine stage groups.

422
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:11,600
These are just empirical. So no model underlying them. Just take everyone to stage three.

423
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:15,609
I guess it's 11 points here. You know, what is the cumulative incidence also?

424
00:39:15,610 --> 00:39:19,360
Absolute risk. So again, the traits other cause mortality is a competing risk.

425
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:29,160
So you can interpret the height of this curve 55% as a 100 men who are stage three C at baseline in 11 years.

426
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:32,360
How many will I do? I expect to actually experience peaks.

427
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:38,980
I'm going to be about 55 out of 100. And so, you know, this one goes out to like 20 years.

428
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:43,120
And then if you actually fit a fine and great model where you assume a common

429
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:47,140
baseline hazard function and you just have a categorical covariate for stage,

430
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:52,090
then of course they all take the same shape. They're just sort of proportionately different by some hazard ratio amount.

431
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:57,360
And so that's that's what you see here. So one just one thing I would point out here that, you know,

432
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:02,770
I think a next step talked to Ralph a little bit about doing is you can kind of see after 13 years,

433
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:06,739
there's maybe one event out of, you know, hundreds of men who were still at risk.

434
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:13,180
And so subject number at risk here. So that kind of raises the possibility of, you know, should you think of like a cure model or some for,

435
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:18,340
you know, if you make it out to 13 years is your risk of zero of ever dying of prostate cancer then?

436
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:24,520
And so in that setting, you know, you could test something, a cure model or you have a probability of cured and then men not cured.

437
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:28,030
What's the timing of likely timing of events? Jeremy Sprints.

438
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:32,190
Nice papers on that. Sense that we may pursue in the future.

439
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:36,520
Okay. Quantifying model performance. I'm going to do a somewhat quickly this.

440
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:43,649
I wanted to draw this out real quick. So you see probably many of you are familiar with that in a survival setting with competing risk.

441
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:47,190
That's a little different. So can you all see this? Okay.

442
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:54,599
So this is tied down here. You know, this is five years and this is ten years of some patient.

443
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:59,700
And he goes along and he has peaks at seven years.

444
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:07,889
And you have another patient who is, you know, censored out here and you have another patient who has DSM here.

445
00:41:07,890 --> 00:41:11,900
And then you have someone who and. You know, has.

446
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:15,940
Okay, I'm here. So. In a survival setting.

447
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:19,870
You have lots of options for how you calculate something like AUC in a binary.

448
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:25,330
If a logistic regression model is fairly straightforward, you can choose Do I do a parametric metric?

449
00:41:25,330 --> 00:41:30,549
But it's much simpler. So I'll send you lots of options. So what I'll show you is a time varying that you see.

450
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:33,010
So it's a metric that's indexed by time.

451
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:40,209
So for example, if I want to say what's the AUC of five years, you have to classify patients as cases or controls.

452
00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:43,180
And so there's different ways, definitions, ways you can do that.

453
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:53,200
And so if I'm talking about five years, this patient would be a control and that's probably the most common definition or they have not experienced.

454
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:59,740
And within five years this patient would be a case, this patient with competing risk.

455
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:07,470
So let's say someone else's sense of sorry that this is OCD and this is censored, this patient, we don't know.

456
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:14,530
They could have experienced something here. So there are neither a case nor a control for purposes of estimating five your AUC.

457
00:42:15,310 --> 00:42:19,930
When you have competing risks, you have options. So someone who dies of a heart attack here either cause mortality.

458
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:27,160
We're treating them as a control because we're saying because they had the competing interests, they never could have had them.

459
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:33,900
So essentially, I could score them as having been censored for some purpose at a million years or something big time.

460
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:40,710
So this patient would be a control there. And obviously all these definitions of who is the case and control change of how I talk about

461
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:45,720
ten years and but but that's the basic idea is you split patients into cases and controls.

462
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:50,780
One interpretation then of the eight you see as you know you randomly take a case and you randomly take a

463
00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:57,809
control and it's the probability the case has higher predicted risk than the control in a survival setting.

464
00:42:57,810 --> 00:43:01,830
Again, now you have to say, well, what predicted risk at what time point?

465
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:06,390
Right. And so if you're fitting a fine and gray model or Cox model that has proportional hazards,

466
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:10,490
the ordering of predicted risk for two patients will be constant over time.

467
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:17,850
So if Patient A has higher risk than Patient B one year from a Cox model patient, they will have higher risk than patient B at every time.

468
00:43:18,570 --> 00:43:21,570
That's not true for random survival for us. We have non proportional hazards.

469
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:25,350
Patient aid could be higher predicted risk at one year, but lower at two years.

470
00:43:25,350 --> 00:43:28,379
And so there's a lot more options here.

471
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:31,640
So. One just one piece of advice here.

472
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:37,340
I kind of learned the hard way. You know, look at the equations when you you know, you're doing an hour package and there's a lot of options here.

473
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:42,170
And many tweets, sometimes people use concordance index and easy interchangeably,

474
00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:46,250
which there is some interchangeability in a binary setting in a survival setting.

475
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:51,170
They can be quite different things and there's a time varying concordance index, something I didn't realize.

476
00:43:51,890 --> 00:43:56,030
There's many flavors on this and you get different numbers or different equations, so let's look at that.

477
00:43:57,020 --> 00:44:00,889
So the ABC is a measure of discrimination.

478
00:44:00,890 --> 00:44:04,520
How well does a model do at discriminating higher risk patients from lower risk?

479
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:10,070
That's all it does, right? It doesn't deal with calibration. So the Brier score is a way to do that.

480
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:15,860
So for a binary outcome wise or for patient, I write you that's a zero or one.

481
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:20,210
It can be some model prediction of the probability. There are one, let's say.

482
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:25,490
So the Brier score then is summing over the squared error over patients and averaging.

483
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:33,900
That's the second mean score there. So for census survival data, the prediction error is very similar, takes a whole different performance.

484
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:40,730
It's an indicator for did the patient have the event of interest prior to some index time?

485
00:44:41,930 --> 00:44:46,370
Little change. So is there a big T? Here is the time of their CSM.

486
00:44:46,910 --> 00:44:52,370
So did they pass five years or was there some time greater than five years?

487
00:44:52,370 --> 00:44:57,260
And then you subtract off some model estimate of their risk assessment certainly from could be from five and great model.

488
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:03,930
And so you tend to use inverse probability of censoring weighting here.

489
00:45:03,930 --> 00:45:06,930
So these metrics depend on the distribution of censoring.

490
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:11,520
And so you'd be generally do inverse waiting for that just one note.

491
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:14,759
So Brier scores do depend on predicted arrest.

492
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:21,089
So you can't just take a staging system, a number 139 and calculate a prior score for you have to assign risk to each of those stages.

493
00:45:21,090 --> 00:45:24,479
And so what we did here is for our staging system in the training.

494
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:25,530
So we just did those.

495
00:45:25,530 --> 00:45:32,700
I can't remember using empirical or finding great risk curves, but you have to convert the number 139 to predicted risk in order to get rider score.

496
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:37,320
So these are sort of hard to injure. You know, bigger is worse.

497
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:42,600
Smaller is better, right? Zero is the best you can do. But other than that, it's a little hard to get a Brier score.

498
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:46,889
.19 is sort of at least I struggle to know what it means.

499
00:45:46,890 --> 00:45:52,200
So Mike Garten and others, and actually before them, we were three other people published on this.

500
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:57,089
They gave this a name. It's sort of like an R squared flavor of Brier score.

501
00:45:57,090 --> 00:46:00,749
So you a no model here and B if you just have an intercept.

502
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:05,880
So if I do a single kaplan-meier curve to my entire group and that's my model, what's the Brier score for that?

503
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:13,230
And then this index of predictive accuracy is saying how far, what percent of the way from that null model Brier score to zero did I get?

504
00:46:13,950 --> 00:46:21,190
So if my NULL model is 0.5 in my no better model with Gleason and things brings me to 0.25, my IPA is 50% right.

505
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:25,650
I got half of the way to perfection. Okay, here's the results.

506
00:46:27,390 --> 00:46:33,180
So these are a you is that five years, ten years, 15 years for the staging system?

507
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:37,620
So 93 in the first five and ten years, I will say I've never seen a number this high.

508
00:46:38,370 --> 00:46:43,679
So I have seen it a couple of times and I was suspicious one time actually I was with a non

509
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:50,040
statistician I was working with and we dove into it and it turned out he was way overfitting the data.

510
00:46:51,450 --> 00:46:57,420
I don't think we're overfitting I guess. Well no. And we, we, we look at the validation data but these are just really high.

511
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:03,540
I have never fit a model at AUC about 90% IPA.

512
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:04,920
Again, you know,

513
00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:12,959
it's the number in this equation I just showed you kind of low at five years and it gets better at ten years and intermediate of five years.

514
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:24,360
So so these are on a 0 to 100 scale. It's expressed as a percent to zero to is good open IPA zero is about 100 is the best you can do.

515
00:47:24,510 --> 00:47:30,150
So so your Brier score of zero is the best you can do.

516
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:35,550
And so if your model Brier score is zero, you get one -0, you get one or hide it.

517
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:40,710
Yeah, sorry, I switched your percent scale. So 100 is the best you could do in terms of IPA.

518
00:47:44,170 --> 00:47:47,710
Isn't it strange? You get these fantastical. You see these and these horrible.

519
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:51,819
Yeah, we saw it even more extremely in a clinical staging system.

520
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:57,070
We had a uses of, you know, 80% ideas of like five or 6%.

521
00:47:57,970 --> 00:48:02,799
It's a little hard to. So maybe just real, just for one more very quick picture.

522
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,540
So one of the instruments. Okay.

523
00:48:04,990 --> 00:48:14,049
So what you're doing with iPad is you have to again, this is time and this is, you know, you have some probability of risk, right?

524
00:48:14,050 --> 00:48:17,590
So you're stage two way and we say this is what we think your risk looks like over time.

525
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:25,210
Then you have a patient's data, look something like this, and then they experience peaks and this is their observed survival per this is predicted.

526
00:48:25,630 --> 00:48:32,709
And so IPA is saying at some fixed time point, you know, it's this indifference that you're squaring and averaging across patients.

527
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:36,550
And so I think intuitively you never expect to predict this kind of occurring.

528
00:48:36,550 --> 00:48:41,530
I can predict someone's survival time. Exactly. And unless you do, you're not going to get an idea of one.

529
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:50,710
But but how good isn't good? Is 19 good? I don't have a good intuition yet for why it's just more higher is better.

530
00:48:51,910 --> 00:48:58,389
So here's here's our competitor for as maybe the main competitor in CC is a current staging system.

531
00:48:58,390 --> 00:49:02,860
So the current staging system actually does very well. So it is Capri or 90, 91 in terms of tenure.

532
00:49:02,950 --> 00:49:06,040
You see, we seem to do a bit better in IPA.

533
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:08,860
One interesting bit, the random survival for right.

534
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:17,019
Kind of think of that as some non parametric benchmark like that should do the best I can actually slightly lower in terms of AUC,

535
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:20,679
but much better in terms of IPA. So that's something we have to look into.

536
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:27,940
Yeah. My intuition is some of the patients who are at very high risk, the random survival force is predicting a higher risk.

537
00:49:28,510 --> 00:49:31,630
And so that helps the IPA. So.

538
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:37,400
Most of these men are low risk and we predict low risk, but a few that have the event early.

539
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:44,660
Your scoring numbers like 0.8 and a few point eight square and make up for a lot of you know if you get you know we predicted

540
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:52,150
0.1 and 0.1 scored I think that's a little bit it's predicting higher risk for some small subset of men and helping that way.

541
00:49:52,970 --> 00:49:56,810
It's kind of an interesting result. Like in terms of discrimination, it doesn't do quite as well.

542
00:49:56,930 --> 00:49:59,540
A continuous interaction model actually does very similar.
