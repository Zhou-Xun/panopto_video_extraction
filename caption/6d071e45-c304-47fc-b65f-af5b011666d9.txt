1
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:11,050
All right. So this is our last week in this lecture.

2
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:15,740
It's crazy. Next week I get to get to this lecture, which I'm very excited about.

3
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:20,340
So. So let me start at the top.

4
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:27,179
You know, I know this semester is hurtling to a close. So today we are going to end the informal lecture.

5
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,730
We're talking about prevention of interventions for mental disorders.

6
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:36,959
Wednesday, we're going to talk about the criminal justice system, which you talked a little bit about when we talked about substance use.

7
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:45,190
But we're in talking about it. And I want to remind you that your check point number six is due on Monday at the start of class.

8
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:49,550
This is true whether you were presenting on Monday or whether you're presenting on Wednesday.

9
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:54,980
And I have assigned you a date to present and one of those to date.

10
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:57,719
So you'll notice there are more people presenting on Monday and Wednesday.

11
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:03,900
I'll discuss why that is and that if for some reason you need to explain this to me,

12
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:07,980
what the reason is as to why you could not present on the day you have been assigned.

13
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:15,540
I will consider changing it, but your expectation is this is an in-person presentation in this room.

14
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:22,050
The global deck is on point number six already. Let me know if you should be able to access it.

15
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:28,440
I probably would have heard by now if that wasn't the case. Please make sure you make a copy of it.

16
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:32,009
Don't just build your deck in that deck or don't just build your slide in that deck.

17
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:40,890
Build it someplace else in case something breaks. Every year, something accidentally changes the theme slash format of the entire deck.

18
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:44,839
And you've spent all this time making your beautiful slide, and somehow it happens.

19
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:52,450
So just don't just undo. That's an undo. And but if you have it elsewhere, then you can always reinsert it.

20
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:59,070
So what we'll do at the start of class on Wednesday, before I lock it, I will ask you to make sure you look at your slide,

21
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:02,460
make sure it's the way you want it, and then I'm going to lock it in while we're in the room together.

22
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:10,080
Okay. You're going to have 3 minutes to share your again with the class either on the fifth or the seventh.

23
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:16,230
Please practice. I gave I. But there's a brief video now on checkpoint number six.

24
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:25,120
Just some tips on giving a presentation. You can say a lot of minutes and I won't be in the back the room and I'll give you a timer with that.

25
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:40,680
So questions about this, number six, how to set a reminder that your final project is due on the ninth.

26
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,420
This is by midnight on the ninth.

27
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:49,710
All of the instructions and the grading rubric for this are in the Read Me First Assignment tab, which is why I wanted to read that first.

28
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:53,310
You've all gotten feedback on checkpoint number five,

29
00:02:53,310 --> 00:03:00,720
so if I ask you to reorganize or ask you to consider or think about coming back, you know, please pay attention to that.

30
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:07,500
Make sure you follow all the logistics of this. So you need to have your name on the paper.

31
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:09,179
The title, the piece Abstract.

32
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:18,329
The main text that references don't count towards your five page limit if you are a mac user and just please make sure you convert this to PDF.

33
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:23,760
I've had situations where students aren't able to upload things you are responsible for making sure your thing got uploaded.

34
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,840
All right, so like, I know this can't be like three days later, you're like, I didn't.

35
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:31,070
I thought it uploaded. I know. Now you all get like a sparkle when you.

36
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:34,790
I didn't know. That's right. And literally somebody told me that.

37
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:38,700
What are you talking about? So you will see the confetti when you upload it.

38
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:41,040
And if you didn't see it, then it didn't work. All right.

39
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:49,349
So this is why you should try to upload before 9 p.m. also, you know, I try to be a very generous grader,

40
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:56,100
but one thing I am not generous are the reason I was able to converse was because we agreed to the plan that you're going to turn things out on time.

41
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,190
There are some times in life when it's better to beg for forgiveness than to ask for permission.

42
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:10,650
This is not one. This is not one of those times.

43
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:17,740
I will not say that. I will grant you any extension that you ask from me,

44
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:25,390
but I guarantee you the outcome will be more favorable to you if you ask for permission than if you were to beg for forgiveness.

45
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:33,730
So there is no. That is the deal. Okay, I stand by this.

46
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:45,450
You might say they have more to say than the limit. I want to write a longer paper.

47
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:50,099
Don't. I'm not going to read a longer. You know what you will get for me?

48
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:54,720
You will get a comment that says, I hope nothing important happened after this fight. Yes, I stopped reading.

49
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:01,589
The reason I'm going to do that is because this this I know that all your life to this point, you've been taught to write very long things.

50
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:04,860
Nobody reads those. You don't read them. I know you don't read them.

51
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:09,030
Okay. So right now it is it is a talent.

52
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:15,450
I do not see how it's a skill that you need to learn how to say things effectively in a short amount of time.

53
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:22,460
All right. So, like, just that that's this is this is still you got space, but, you know,

54
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,760
really edit editing is something your biggest killer in our final scene.

55
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:30,420
Should we go back and add citations to that?

56
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:32,840
You can if you want.

57
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:39,509
Yeah, that's that for certainly if especially if you're like citing a statistic or something like that, it should look like one cohesive thing.

58
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:43,750
So it shouldn't be like abstract, like heartbreak paper.

59
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,540
Right. It should be cohesive. Okay. So if you're.

60
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:53,489
That's a great question. So if you're if you're especially if you're citing a statistic or a quote from somebody,

61
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:56,850
I'm going to expect to see some citations from where that came from.

62
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:02,610
The other thing I want to say is like, I don't know where I just it's not it's not universal.

63
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:11,120
But I've noticed this with some students over the years is that I think because you're so afraid of plagiarizing or being accused of plagiarism,

64
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:15,360
you know, you'll have these like very long quotes that make no sense to have quoted something.

65
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,690
I don't do that. And I've said that to you in some of your in some of your things, like don't do that.

66
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:24,660
Put it in your own words and provide the citation. Okay.

67
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:34,680
And the if it if you need to have a large text block of text, put it in, set it appropriately.

68
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:41,780
Right. But like, unless there's a reason for you to directly quote something you shouldn't be directly quoting.

69
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,960
I encourage you again to talk to the writing center.

70
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:50,070
You still have time to go make an appointment with them if you have questions about any of these things.

71
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:56,940
When? When how would you convert something from a direct quote into a into a paraphrase, for example?

72
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:05,730
What about this? All right.

73
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:11,880
Finally, I am pleased to announce that the parts I mentioned that were fewer presenters on the service.

74
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:15,470
This is because we have the equipment.

75
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,729
There as an optional because I know this this court does not normally this class is

76
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:24,930
scheduled to overlap with this court session but they move the class this year.

77
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:34,230
So all but court is held from 130 to 330, the Washtenaw County Mental Health Court, this is what Patricia Doyle from Miami told us about.

78
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:40,620
So we are invited by Judge Volvo to observe the proceedings of this court.

79
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,590
Right after class. You're going to get an announcement that will have all of these details written out.

80
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:51,890
We need to be there by 115. So if you're so again, this is optional.

81
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:56,610
There's no rated, there's nothing going to turn in afterwards from this. But if you want to know, I will be there.

82
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:05,530
I guess I'll probably ask for like an RSVP, so I'll send something out so I know how many folks to be with you.

83
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:11,790
I do want you to make sure if you attend this, that you reread the mental health court description from week 13.

84
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:19,580
If you didn't read that, said you need to address business casual is what we should be address.

85
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:24,209
So this is what you should like. This is what you need to be wearing. All right, so like you got this is a real court.

86
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:30,840
People are like real lives are like so we need to to show respect to their and

87
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:37,200
we want have the opportunity to talk to the judge and your staff afterwards. So questions about this.

88
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,520
Mystery box format. Yes.

89
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:52,979
Yes. So we're going to have a hard stop at 1:00 and I'm going to get it on the right.

90
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:55,740
So it is it's I'm hoping that we can get it done.

91
00:08:55,770 --> 00:09:01,560
That's how I'm hoping we can get as many people presenting on Monday so we can end as quickly as possible to get here.

92
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:09,509
Looking at your score, we cannot. So, I mean, you're going to have to bring some kind of snack on the way or eat lunch in here or something like that.

93
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:19,079
You know, I just like watch, you know, it's hot. So yeah, I think we are going would we be able to you from quarterly or do we have to be there?

94
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,890
You can leave early, but you need to leave in between a case.

95
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:27,600
So the way. But I can't I don't think I can. Yes, that would be okay.

96
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,929
I want you to just let me know and then we'll make sure you're seated.

97
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:35,800
Like, because it's it's a small room. It's probably the size of this room, really.

98
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:41,670
It's not smaller. And so in that it's going to be a tight fit no matter what.

99
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:46,600
That's. Two questions about this.

100
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:55,440
Conflicting lots of. I'm sure I'll be fine and I'm happy to provide it.

101
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:59,640
No, I mean, it's it's you know, I would you know, you can explain.

102
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:01,889
This is the last day of class for Wednesday classes.

103
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:07,230
So, like, I understand if they're not willing to let you do this, this this court, this happens every two weeks.

104
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:11,610
And so if you want to go on your own, either next term or what have you, you're welcome to.

105
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:16,610
I will take my grad class to this court sometime probably of April next year.

106
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:21,800
And so if you want if you miss it, you can take take it then. But this is, you know.

107
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:27,440
Yeah. But I would rather not be late.

108
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,850
So if you've got to. Know. I know I'm the class right before then.

109
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:34,000
But I'd rather you leave. Come for 45 minutes and leave.

110
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:39,180
And I don't know that we're going to go the whole time. That's the other thing, which it's totally unpredictable, depends on the size of the dock.

111
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:48,280
So it could go up to 330, but it probably but also like if you need to leave early, you can just make sure that you're seated.

112
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:53,830
It's less disruptive, anything at all except during a break of proceedings.

113
00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:05,890
The question about this. I really it's it's it's so incredibly powerful.

114
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,200
It really is. Every time I go, I just I'm renewed faith in humanity.

115
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,250
So. Okay. All right.

116
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:21,009
So let's talk about what was out our our class.

117
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:29,950
We're talking about prevention and intervention. So what you heard about this week in the readings is the reason I assign these readings is

118
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:34,929
because they really illustrate the tension between what we learned about in public health,

119
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:39,690
which is prevent, prevent, prevent and what that.

120
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:47,920
And so even though the challenge of having a a system or an approach that can both think about prevention,

121
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:55,150
but then when cases occur, can still respond in a appropriate and timely manner.

122
00:11:56,050 --> 00:12:00,940
And right now, we basically have a system that does neither. But as we learned about this week's readings,

123
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:07,150
which really focus on crisis response and for people who live with serious chronic illness, this is really difficult.

124
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:17,050
But so before we talk about interventions, talk about prevention. So remember back and we're talking about development.

125
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:20,110
So we've talked about the whole life force in this in this previous class.

126
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:22,120
So we're going to go back to childhood today.

127
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:31,320
But before I tell you that, I got to remind you of sort of the generic way that we think about prevention from many things,

128
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:33,300
not all things, but many things we talk about with public health.

129
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:37,330
So we talked you've probably heard the term primary, secondary and tertiary prevention.

130
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:41,290
Right. So primary prevention is a COVID vaccine that we all got.

131
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:49,630
Secondary prevention would be like that new whatever the medication they have where like you take it and then like you have less,

132
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:53,040
you don't get hospitalized, everything works out, you suck.

133
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:56,710
So that's secondary prevention and tertiary prevention.

134
00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:07,210
Would the, you know, something that is not really prevention and in any capacity it would be like getting on an and on a ventilator to prevent death.

135
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:14,440
Okay. So that's sort of what we're trying to prevent. And the first point is, I'm trying to prevent you from getting sick here.

136
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,760
I'm trying to prevent a morbidity from. You've gotten sick now.

137
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:23,340
I'm trying to make it so it's not as bad. And then here, trying to prevent some really severe like almost certainly death.

138
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:34,690
Right. So this this idea of primary, secondary, tertiary prevention works really well for conditions when we have a known etiology and pathology.

139
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:43,670
So the influenza vaccine, for example, prevents or reduces the likelihood of getting sick later.

140
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:47,020
But it doesn't have anything to do with your likelihood of getting sick for measles.

141
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:52,630
These are totally different sort of, you know, whatever vaccines required.

142
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:58,120
And similarly, something like cervical cancer, like getting a pap smear does not prevent breast cancer.

143
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:04,989
Right. So like we have a known etiology and we have specific interventions that help us sort of break the

144
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:12,190
chain from early stage to middle stage to late stage pathology there for for conditions like that.

145
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:16,450
We don't have anything like that for mental health. There's nothing there's no primary.

146
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,670
Like what is the what is what is specific primary prevention?

147
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:26,530
What's the equivalent of a pap smear for depression? I would just like you know what I mean?

148
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:30,100
Like, what is the there is there is no equivalent or first psychosis.

149
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,480
What's the equivalent of a vaccine for autism? Right.

150
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,610
There is nothing like that. And so instead we don't talk about primary, secondary, tertiary prevention.

151
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:43,170
We talk about universal selected and indicated prevention.

152
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:47,010
And this framework is now kind of broadened out to a lot of other mental health things,

153
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:53,490
but it's always been presented a lot of public health ideas, but it's always been the framework that we use for mental health.

154
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:58,499
So a universal prevention approach is something where I'm going to universal.

155
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,500
It means I'm going to target the entire population, everybody's going to get it.

156
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:06,960
My goal is to reduce risk factors and enhance protective factors in a very generic way.

157
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:14,600
Okay. So let us go through the examples of the second I selected intervention is my target is now just

158
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:21,440
some high risk subgroup and my objective is to reduce those subgroup specific risk factors,

159
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:28,900
something that they have that the rest of the population doesn't have. And then indicate prevention is people who are high risk individuals.

160
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:31,570
All right. So now there's something I know about this individual.

161
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:38,170
They are either maybe they're experiencing prodromal signs of depression or psychosis.

162
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:43,330
Maybe they've had a accidental overdose.

163
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:46,360
Right. There's something about this individual now, not just about the group.

164
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:51,190
Right. So like the group might be think about, like, kids in low income communities.

165
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:54,429
Like, that's a group that's a very heterogeneous group,

166
00:15:54,430 --> 00:16:00,040
even though that's a that's that is much higher risk, just like kids in general, which would be universal.

167
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:06,280
So some examples. So like a universal prevention for reducing suicide risk would be to reduce access

168
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:09,739
to firearms because 60% of suicides in the United States happen by firearms.

169
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:13,360
So that's a universal prevention strategy. Everybody gets less access to guns.

170
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:18,200
A high risk subgroup might be.

171
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:21,620
Well, we know that suicide risk is higher among people who can pass rated.

172
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,550
So I'm going to focus on it.

173
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:28,550
And I don't know anything about this person beyond the fact that they've been in contact with the criminal justice system.

174
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,050
I can develop programs that are targeting people who've been through that system.

175
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:36,980
That's an example of a selected suicide prevention strategy.

176
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:41,910
And then there's indicator which would be like you've shown up in the emergency department for self-harm, right?

177
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:47,860
Or an attempted suicide. And so there's this is now you're very high risk as an individual.

178
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:55,240
And so I'm going to do develop programs both in terms of focusing resources, focusing time, focusing money,

179
00:16:55,450 --> 00:17:00,609
potentially in a way that it doesn't make sense to provide these resources to the entire population,

180
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:04,690
because the vast majority of people have not shown up in the emergency department to make a suicide attempt.

181
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:18,909
So the know the other way to think about this is that programs that a universal approach to prevention is expected to have very small benefits,

182
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:25,730
but to a very large number of people. So no one individual is expected to really benefit a whole lot.

183
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:26,520
Right. So think about this.

184
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:33,930
With vaccines, like not very few of us, thankfully, we're going to get very sick from COVID to about 2% of people die from COVID.

185
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:37,770
Right. When we're not before pre vaccine now we're at less than a half percent.

186
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,030
So. So that means 90% of people are not going to die.

187
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:49,260
Okay. So that so the benefit that you and I got from getting these shots in terms of death was small.

188
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:57,480
Like it was small. Okay. Because the risk itself was already small for for older adults, that risk was now higher.

189
00:17:57,550 --> 00:18:02,430
Right. So 2% was the entire U.S. population of all ages. Now we're talking about people 89 years old.

190
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:05,850
Like that risk is not 2%. That risk is now 20%. 30%. Okay.

191
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:11,100
And then if you are an older person and you have cancer, you're an older person and heart disease right now we're over here.

192
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:11,900
Right. So you can imagine.

193
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:19,620
So here the the the benefit that any one person gets from the universal prevention is going to be small, but also the risk is small.

194
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,760
All right. So that's the other thing that makes a universal prevention program ethical.

195
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:28,469
The risk that is induced by making it harder to get a firearm is relatively small

196
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:32,520
relative to the potential benefit that the entire population is going to experience.

197
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:40,440
Similarly here, the more once you're getting into higher risk subgroups, our high risk groups that indicated prevention,

198
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:46,870
you can do more intensive interventions which usually have more risk of harm.

199
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:50,470
Okay, so like think about that.

200
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:55,860
The experience of that we've learned about of people being in the emergency department and not being able to get to a psychiatric.

201
00:18:56,040 --> 00:19:00,420
Right. So they're stuck in this emergency department for 20 days. You can't tell me that's not harmful.

202
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:05,400
Okay. But like the thing, I'm trying to get to that person, how to get them appropriate psychiatric care.

203
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:11,580
So even if I wouldn't keep someone who was having mild depressive symptoms in an emergency department for 20 days,

204
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:15,750
I would keep somebody who I thought was at very high risk of self-harm because I think the benefit to

205
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:19,830
them is going to pay off in a way that it wouldn't pay off for somebody who was having mild symptoms.

206
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:27,960
Okay. So when we think about prevention, we have to talk about development.

207
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:31,110
So it's sort of why in the field of epidemiology,

208
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:34,979
we talk a lot about risk factors and trying to identify causal risk factors

209
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:40,050
because in our there's a hope that if I can understand what caused a lead to B,

210
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:44,580
then I can figure out that. Then that would tell me something. Although this is not actually always the case.

211
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:49,110
How to prevent b i intervening on the path for you to be okay.

212
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:55,200
And so that means that what the questions I'm trying to understand are what distinguishes a

213
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:01,649
developmental path that's very risky for developing psychopathology versus one that's less risky.

214
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:06,720
And that reflects the fact that psychopathology is both dimensional and it's a process.

215
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:12,000
So there's not a line in the sand between depression and not depression. There's not a line in the sand between depression and anxiety.

216
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:20,820
These are things that we all if all of the symptoms of mental health disorders are nonspecific.

217
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:24,260
Right. So I asked you if you've ever seen a ghost. And actually, that's a loose nation.

218
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,760
Okay. Like, right. That's what that was.

219
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:34,259
So the so even something that we think about is a severe and we also talked about which was substance use like are there things,

220
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:38,040
you know, how many times do you check your phone? Right. This is a this is a reinforced behavior, right.

221
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:43,710
These are that that there are elements of psychopathology that are fundamental to human nature.

222
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:52,680
And so that's different than, you know, having a heart attack or something like that, which is a it's a discrete pathological experience.

223
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:58,469
Every form of psychopathology has a natural history. And so if we understand the development,

224
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:06,000
sort of why is it the depression kicks off in the teens and really it's going in the twenties and thirties and then declines.

225
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:11,219
Why does that curve look like that? Why doesn't it look like this increase over the entire life course?

226
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:15,840
Right. That helps us understand something about causes and potentially interventions.

227
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:19,770
And we also need to consider individuals in their environment. We don't live in a vacuum.

228
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:21,059
These don't exist in a vacuum.

229
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:26,730
And if we're going to try to intervene on something to think about, what was the context in which we're going to do that intervention?

230
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:33,350
So all of this together is illustrated by this is a graph that's made by Shep Cullum,

231
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:36,020
who's a former chair of the Department of Mental Health at Johns Hopkins.

232
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:41,210
And what's interesting about it is if you go here, he's kind of at the stages of life.

233
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:44,720
So, you know, going across the top of infancy to old age.

234
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:52,510
And he's also got these kind of important threshold milestones. So, like, this is the kind of stuff that we we are wiring our thinking about.

235
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,100
We're talking about suicide prevention, for example, in my own work.

236
00:21:55,730 --> 00:22:05,180
But the other thing that I really like about this graph is that he also has a layer of what is most important in these different life stages.

237
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:08,120
So when you're a child, you're most important.

238
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:13,160
People are you're like people that you're living with when whoever that is, that's parents, grandparents, you know, whatever.

239
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:19,609
So this helps me think about like if I'm going to do an intervention, I need to involve the family, right?

240
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:24,620
It would be it would be kind of wild to think about doing an intervention for young kids that somehow did not involve the family.

241
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:28,970
When I get to school age again, most of these kids are there in schools.

242
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:32,450
As we get older, we get to peers. As we get into young adulthood.

243
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:36,920
Now you've got romantic partners. You might have the broader family of in-laws.

244
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:42,290
You also have work rights are like you can think this helps sort of array an idea

245
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:46,850
of like how are what are the potential places where I might do intervention?

246
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:50,960
Also, where are the potential sources of risk?

247
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:52,729
Right. Both risk and protection. Right.

248
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:59,690
So we many some of you are doing projects on work and like how work can be both a benefit and a harm to mental health.

249
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:04,400
Right. And that that's work's not really relevant to kids, but it is relevant to adults.

250
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:14,569
So you have shown me this graph before. So again, helping to understand why, why this, why we need to think about development.

251
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:19,510
So most people, if they've tried, if they're going to try alcohol, have tried it by about age 18.

252
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:24,530
If they're going to try cannabis, they do it by about age 20 and if they're going to try and identify much later.

253
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:28,700
All right. So this graph doesn't continue to increase.

254
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:32,630
Right. There's not this there's not a second peak here in the forties where everybody sort of,

255
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:36,709
you know, as a mid-life crisis and they decide they're going to try drugs for the first time.

256
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:41,930
No, it's like this is the point in the life course where this stuff happens, which I showed you this with depression,

257
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:46,700
where again, the x axis here starting at age 20, because they were all adults when they got into the survey.

258
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:50,780
So there is part of the curve that's that's still over there, that's not witnessed here.

259
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:55,960
But the most important part that I want to show you is that the incidence of depression declines as people age.

260
00:23:55,970 --> 00:24:01,580
So whatever it is that's causing depression is happening earlier in the life course or it's relevant earlier in the life.

261
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:03,290
For some it is later in the life course.

262
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:13,900
We talked we didn't talk about PTSD much in this class, but trauma is a is a very important risk factor for lots of different mental health disorders.

263
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:21,190
This is data by Naomi Breslow showing you the two incidents of trauma in Detroit by age 35.

264
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:28,580
And so you can see if you walked at 50% are over that about 50% of people in Detroit have been exposed to at least one trauma by age 30.

265
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:36,360
Right. So if you know, if you're trying to prevent PTSD or depression or anxiety or substance use, which are all things that are,

266
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:43,709
they're more likely to occur among people who have experienced trauma, which we now kind of call childhood adversity or adverse childhood experiences.

267
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:48,870
Right. Like that language should really exist when she was doing this work in the nineties, you've got to be earlier.

268
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:57,300
So then but then we get to the problem. It's like, okay, well, when does that when does a disorder start?

269
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:08,070
So like, what is our what does our let's talk about depression. So what's what are some options for when we're going to say when depression started?

270
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:22,040
Yeah, I think. I mean. So first sign of symptoms might not be been right.

271
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:22,760
Well, right now.

272
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:35,360
So is that when depression sort of like when it starts, like tampering with alcohol or like different routine before like it starts becoming a.

273
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,580
Yeah, I can I can do it my starts from my first experience symptoms when I start starts becoming impairing.

274
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:47,180
Yeah. Your first medical diagnosis, first time somebody picks up on it, that's maybe where it starts.

275
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:56,330
So the point is, is that it's not clear which of these is the right answer for prevention.

276
00:25:57,710 --> 00:26:04,670
Okay. So typically what we have is when you first meet diagnostic criteria, that's what most of our data have.

277
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:08,000
But even that is after symptoms have started.

278
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,250
And because, you know,

279
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:16,610
because you remember back from the first part of class that the way you get into treatment is you decide you need you want help,

280
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:20,540
not that you want help. Therefore you got into treatment, right?

281
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:26,030
Like that's not how this go. So instead we know that people who get help are much more severe and people who do not get help.

282
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:31,790
And so all those caveats, what I'm showing you is what is the median age of diagnosis?

283
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:35,960
So this is not the median age of symptom start. This is not the median age at which they started.

284
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:40,790
They started becoming a parent. This is the median age at which somebody this they all came together with a diagnosis.

285
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:46,940
And for any disorder, the median age 14, any disorder on here, where are the 14 year olds?

286
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:57,759
Where are the kids? They're in school. So what that means is that now the four women are just going to stay artificially for the

287
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:02,140
time being that I'm going to count disorder starts when you first meet diagnostic criteria.

288
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:07,120
50% of people who are going to meet diagnostic criteria have met it by age 14.

289
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:11,840
Where are those people? They are in. So what? That they're not just in school.

290
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:17,260
Where else is where else might they be? Where else are the kids?

291
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:24,470
Where were you at 14? My basement listening to some music.

292
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:29,149
Yes, I see you. But where else? When you had to leave your sanctuary.

293
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:32,600
Where did you go? It's Florence. Yeah.

294
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:35,780
So maybe there were some after school activities in your home. In your church.

295
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:39,230
Probably spend time. Yeah, right. I, you know, so.

296
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:42,920
But. But none of those places are they're doctor's office.

297
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:49,250
None of you are not spending a lot of time in the doctor's office. If if you were like most children, you probably saw a doctor once a year.

298
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:59,450
Right. So the what that means is that the people who care about health or mental health are not the people who have a role in preventing.

299
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:06,239
Mental health, mental disorders. So that means these are what we might refer to as kind of nontraditional stakeholders.

300
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:11,610
So this is your coaches, this is your religious leaders, this is your schoolteachers, this is your administrators.

301
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:18,780
Right? That's who that's a nontraditional stakeholder would be. Beyond that, the people that you're trying to reach,

302
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:22,610
particularly if you're trying to work in an underserved community, may not even be members of that community.

303
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:30,060
And so but that this is this is where community based participatory research comes in above and beyond.

304
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:34,830
Sort of helping to kind of have a conversation about this is a priority for kids.

305
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:45,990
The other thing is that when we consider that 14 is, you know, that 50% of cases, if they're going to occur, they're going to occur by age 14.

306
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:53,430
That we have to think about, well, what's modifiable? Because there are some elements of this trajectory that are potentially not modifiable.

307
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:58,230
So, for example, like the school is not an appropriate place for modifying the home environment.

308
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,300
Similarly, the home environment,

309
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:06,060
you might be able to have some sort of spillover into school that's going to probably makes more sense to have lots of stakeholders there.

310
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:12,390
But what's most important, and what I want you to really keep in mind as we go through some of the examples today,

311
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:17,549
is that often the modifiable part of the trajectory or the thing that we're going to

312
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:23,250
try to modify has as almost nothing to do with any specific form of psychopathology.

313
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:29,880
This is why I said there's no pap smear for depression, so that we have as a T-shirt printed for all of us next.

314
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:37,859
So what do I mean by I mean there's not so passionate removes pre-cancerous cells are a test for pre-cancerous cells.

315
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:41,040
It's a very specific test. It doesn't prevent breast cancer.

316
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:44,160
It doesn't prevent colon cancer. It doesn't prevent asthma. It doesn't grant any of those things.

317
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,720
The things I'm going to show you data in a few minutes on the good behavior game, the good behavior game,

318
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:55,200
prevent drug use, prevents suicide, prevent depression, keeps people in school, prevents criminal activity.

319
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:59,450
Okay. But none of those. Those are not the same things.

320
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:04,020
Okay. Similarly, the experience, score intervention that I talk to you about prevents falls,

321
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:08,280
you know, prevents cognitive decline, prevents all this a range of things.

322
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:16,140
Why? Because they're targeting some shared path, some factor that that all of these are not unique paths for each poor outcome.

323
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:20,310
Why? Because the outcomes themselves are not you are not unique.

324
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:23,550
There's no line in the sand between depression and anxiety.

325
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:29,940
Most people with depression are also using substances. Right. So that's you got to remember that all these things are traveling together.

326
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:39,329
So one but but it also means that the interventions this will become more clear in a second are not targeting like a depression.

327
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:43,080
Intervention is not have anything to do with you feeling sad.

328
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:48,800
Does not target your feelings of sadness. And specifically, this one made more sense today with the good behavior game,

329
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:52,580
the good behavior can prevent drug use without talking to kids about drugs.

330
00:30:54,040 --> 00:31:00,670
Okay. All right. The last couple of things I'll say my preamble is that because now we've got to be in schools or in families.

331
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:05,229
That means we've got to talk about stigma. And a lot of people don't like to talk about drugs.

332
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:07,809
They don't want to think their kids are on drugs. They don't want to aren't using drugs.

333
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:11,740
They don't want to think about depression or talk about depression. They don't have even the language to talk about it.

334
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:20,580
So in addition to there being a sort of just straight up like lack of literacy, mental health literacy, there's also often lack of political will.

335
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:25,870
People with, for example, who are dealing with addiction are seen as less moral.

336
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:26,860
Right. We've talked about this.

337
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:34,390
We talked about when we talk about the mental or drug problems, there's also a conflation of psychiatric disorders with violence.

338
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:39,940
You see this constantly in the news media where, you know,

339
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:45,340
without very much justification as to what is what is happening or again or any acknowledgment of the denominator.

340
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:50,870
Right. I'm not saying that people who commit violence, sometimes those people have a mental health disorder.

341
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:55,560
There is also the vast, vast, vast majority of people with mental health disorder do not commit violence.

342
00:31:55,570 --> 00:31:59,080
Right. So you don't have the denominator. All you see is the numerator.

343
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:04,580
And there's lots of things that also tie people together who commit violence that are not mental disorder,

344
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:10,090
like if you have access to firearms, for example. Okay.

345
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:16,390
Oh. All right. So let me let me tell you, before I tell you what works, I've got to tell you two things that don't work.

346
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,440
So because you might still be saying why, why we should still screen high risk people.

347
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,540
Does I want to show you.

348
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:28,900
So they did this so the Veterans Administration so people who have gotten better at military veterans have higher risk of suicide,

349
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:32,410
of people in the armed services in general, high risk of suicide in a general population.

350
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:34,900
And so there is this idea of like, okay,

351
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:41,139
we're going to start screening people for suicidal behavior when they come in for their V.A. medical appointments.

352
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:46,600
And the logic for this was this statistic, which is that during the year prior to suicide,

353
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:50,800
two thirds of people made contact with a primary care physician.

354
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:58,370
So the idea is like, okay, well, two thirds of people who die by suicide the following year saw a doctor in that year prior.

355
00:32:58,390 --> 00:33:01,480
So maybe that's a point of intervention, right? Like that's the logic.

356
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:07,030
Okay. Which makes sense. The problem is it doesn't work.

357
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:10,390
So everyone shown on this graph died by suicide.

358
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:18,670
So what I'm showing you is what percent of those people were assessed for suicidal ideation in the year prior to their suicide,

359
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:24,050
and the answer is almost 80%. How many of them were assessed for suicidal ideation at their last visit?

360
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:27,320
40%. And they still die by suicide.

361
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:32,690
How many of them expressed ideation to other people in the past year?

362
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:38,060
40% are about 40%. 35%. About 5% in their past visit.

363
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:42,260
And how many told the doctors that they were thinking of their specific plan?

364
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:46,820
They had two in their life. Almost 20%. And they still die by suicide.

365
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:56,750
So the the problem when you just have a focus on high risk individuals is that there's no room for error, you know.

366
00:33:56,780 --> 00:34:03,440
Right. And we don't have, you know, be beyond, you know, calling, you know,

367
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:07,249
having someone in Von Tyler hospitalized because there are a harm to their self or others.

368
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:13,490
We don't have good interventions for suicidal behavior at this point in the developmental trajectory.

369
00:34:14,930 --> 00:34:20,980
And consistent with this and I'll show you data in a second, we don't screen for suicide, not just in vets in general population.

370
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:24,950
You've probably never been asked if you've attempted suicide by a doctor's office and if you have,

371
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:29,630
they're actually not practicing best practice medicine. Okay.

372
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:34,220
So what are some examples? So you may say, oh, the screening still good.

373
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:38,450
Me maybe. Okay, so there's other ways you can think about screening patients in primary care.

374
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:43,340
Well, the people who decide what we get screened for in primary care is this group called the U.S. Preventative Task Force.

375
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:50,900
They grade all of the things that we might get. So, you know, you get the aim is everyone should get it.

376
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:55,970
The benefit is substantial. If it's offered as an A, your insurance has to pay for it.

377
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:58,879
B says it recommends it.

378
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:05,610
There's a high certainty the net benefit is moderate or there's a moderate certainty that the net benefit is moderate to substantial.

379
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:09,350
So now you've already like, oh my God. Right. I know my eyes glazed over, too.

380
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:19,470
But the point is, is, you know, there's there's we think this will help problems like that's a, B, C is maybe selectively offer it.

381
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:28,100
We don't know if there's a you know, they might there might be a benefit that the benefit is rare or it's small d as do not do this.

382
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:32,570
The risks outweigh the benefits. And I guess we cannot make a conclusion statement.

383
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:39,370
So the first thing I want to tell you is that there are no a screening recommendations for anything we've talked about in this class.

384
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:45,860
There are no screening recommendations. So there is no situation where the U.S. preventative task forces.

385
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:49,460
There is a high certainty that the net benefit of screening is substantial.

386
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:57,770
In fact, the only ones if we have our BS or AIS. So for adults for suicide it's an I.

387
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:04,280
This was recently updated. It's still in I that is again, the evidence is inconclusive and that you should not offer this service.

388
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:12,300
For screening for adults. It's a B. And again, the way this is written is it says recommend screening for depression,

389
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:15,800
including an adult population, including pregnant and postpartum women.

390
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:23,820
And then it has this nice caveat. Screening should be implemented with adequate symptoms and systems in place to ensure accurate diagnosis,

391
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:33,360
effective treatment and appropriate follow up. So it's doing if all these things are in place, which what have you learned in this class?

392
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:39,750
They're not in place. Okay. So this is this is a I'm trying not to be too cynical,

393
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:47,490
but this really does sort of rather than sort of point to the fact that the system is the problem.

394
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:53,150
This, again, points tells a provider you can do this along with all of these other things.

395
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:58,049
You are in place for a cognitive impairment screening.

396
00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:07,140
This is and I we don't do this for alcohol use in adults it's a B for adolescents called a 17.

397
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:11,640
It's an eye. The problem is that most of those kids have already had their first drink by

398
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:17,400
the time they're if they're going to or from age 18 for prenatal depression,

399
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:22,410
it's a B for kids. When most of this stuff starts for autism, it's in high.

400
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:28,030
For depression. It's a B for kids younger than 11.

401
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:33,370
It's an I, right? So young kids, they don't recommend screening for depression.

402
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:38,469
For teens, they recommend as a B for alcohol use.

403
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:42,640
I already showed you that. They do change now to my anxiety, so I will tell you.

404
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:48,430
So the new anxiety recommendations are it to be for 8 to 18 and it's an eye for less than seven.

405
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:51,830
So that's the new recommendation that they just came out with in October.

406
00:37:56,020 --> 00:38:03,579
Okay. So. So. Well, preventative screening in primary care is not really a useful thing.

407
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:06,970
And not it's not my opinion about that. U.S. Task Force doesn't.

408
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:10,240
Only says it's useful if these other things are in place, which they are not.

409
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:14,379
There are specific populations where it does make sense for us to do screening.

410
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:19,390
And so each of these conditions is not a full extent of extensive conditions,

411
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:24,680
but each of these does they're they're kind of representative, professional society.

412
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:31,810
So, for example, the American Diabetes Association has specific recommendations for doing psychosocial screening for people with diabetes.

413
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:37,120
And it's not everybody, but if somebody has diabetes is poorly controlled or they're starting on a new

414
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:42,519
medication or they've had some change at home that might change their their routine.

415
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:46,419
So it's going to be harder to kind of stick to diet and exercise. Those are the times.

416
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:50,290
Or, you know, they're dealing with new complications like vision loss or something like that.

417
00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:53,440
Certainly with cancer, we've talked a little bit about this as well,

418
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:59,020
that there's an entire field of psychopharmacology that does have specific recommendations for supporting mental health needs.

419
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:04,870
So it's not the case that we shouldn't be talking to people in the doctor's office about their mental health.

420
00:39:05,290 --> 00:39:12,090
But the idea that you should be doing routine screening of everything we've talked about, this class in primary care is just not supported.

421
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:16,360
It's not going to do anything. We screen for things that are asymptomatic.

422
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:20,890
Okay. Like a mammogram is for someone who is asymptomatic.

423
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:25,350
If you have a lump, that's not a screening mammogram. That's a diagnostic mammogram.

424
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:28,510
It's the same test for the purpose is different. Okay.

425
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:36,000
So here there are specific things where we know depression and anxiety and substance use problems, etc. do come up a lot.

426
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:39,910
And so it does make sense for us to have screening regimens that make that.

427
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:44,030
This is now a hybrid separate. Okay.

428
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:47,420
Questions about this. Okay.

429
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:56,610
Let me tell you. So let's talk about Universal now. So first, I'll tell you about an ineffective universal prevention programs.

430
00:39:57,510 --> 00:40:00,590
These are awareness campaigns generally are ineffective.

431
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:06,060
So this is a how many of you I'm sure all of you have seen like anti-smoking campaigns, tobacco, you know, whatever.

432
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:15,659
So so these you know, these awareness campaigns are, you know, obviously targeting the general population.

433
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:19,920
They're not it's not like you just get served that on your just you. It goes to the entire population.

434
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:24,599
So this is a study of two different two different interventions.

435
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:32,670
One was called the Truth Campaign and the other one was called What Stands For and a different one to different awareness campaigns.

436
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:38,850
And so this is the survey data. It's like asking someone after they saw the campaign are do you think you're going to try a cigaret?

437
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:45,510
So if you got Saw the truth campaign, you said you were less likely you were going to see try a cigaret.

438
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:49,170
If you saw twice you said you were more likely you're going to try a cigaret.

439
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:55,610
The and then if you go down to and but part of it is like who cares what you say you're going to do?

440
00:40:55,670 --> 00:41:03,260
What do you do? So then this is actually did you actually smoke a cigaret if you saw truth, but only saw it a little bit.

441
00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:07,510
The answer is it didn't do anything. It was all 3.99. That's basically one, right.

442
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:15,870
No effect. If you saw hi. If you saw a lot of the truth campaign, you were less likely to smoke a cigaret if you saw this tax.

443
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:19,010
Have no impact on your likelihood of using cigarets.

444
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:26,659
So the idea that awareness campaigns in and of themselves can change behavior is is mixed at best.

445
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:34,670
And certainly there's not strong evidence that these things are where we should be putting our money to try to shake them.

446
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:39,110
How do you remember getting there? You know, you might have been.

447
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:42,730
So there is a sense for drug abuse, resistance, education.

448
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:47,090
It was designed by police to reduce drug use money.

449
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:55,489
Really, and a lot of federal money today, it's not quite 75%, but still about two thirds of schools use there.

450
00:41:55,490 --> 00:41:59,959
And most of those schools, this is the only education that students get about drugs.

451
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:04,040
This is the only drug prevention program that exists in most of these school districts.

452
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:12,610
It was revised in 2003. So it's a little different now than when I when I was exposed to there was your did you have a police officer come?

453
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:16,730
So you got a police officer in full uniform come talk to us about.

454
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:21,830
We reiterated all my fears about drugs. So what is drug?

455
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,940
How does that work? So this is from a meta analysis.

456
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:30,089
This is there have been other ones since then, but I don't need to show them to you because they all show the same thing.

457
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:34,710
And the data is so, so very clear as to what the situation is.

458
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,829
So this is not these are not randomized controlled trials.

459
00:42:37,830 --> 00:42:44,430
These are kind of studies you proposed for comparing kids who got deer to another district that kind of got there later.

460
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:47,430
So there does teach kids a lot about drugs.

461
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:56,310
So after their children know a lot more about what drugs are and what they look like and you know what happens if you might use them,

462
00:42:57,510 --> 00:43:01,620
they have a little bit kind of more negative attitudes towards those drugs.

463
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:05,069
They feel like they can talk to their friends better.

464
00:43:05,070 --> 00:43:08,550
They've got a little feel a little bit better about themselves in terms of self-esteem.

465
00:43:08,850 --> 00:43:15,570
They feel good about better about the police. And there is actually absolutely no impact on their later likelihood of using drugs.

466
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:24,530
There is no evidence that there is anything. The people who are out there any less likely to use drugs and people do not get there is.

467
00:43:25,890 --> 00:43:29,010
Despite this this program is one of these examples of.

468
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:31,739
But it should work. Like, why doesn't it work?

469
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:40,170
We're just trying to, like, explain to kids how dangerous drugs are and why don't you tell me what you would say to that person?

470
00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:43,410
Why doesn't there work? Why doesn't telling kids how scary drugs are work?

471
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:54,280
Yeah. God, I mean, I think our public health knowledge keep telling people to not do something.

472
00:43:54,490 --> 00:43:59,830
It's super dangerous. People might be curious about it and try it.

473
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:04,570
Why do people get their first drugs from a friend?

474
00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:09,970
Is that friend on the brink of death? And is that friend addicted to that substance?

475
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:13,950
No, because if they were, they wouldn't be sharing their drugs with you. Yeah.

476
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:19,060
Okay. Right. They're dependent on that. And we're not they're not like, oh, I've got an extra.

477
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:27,939
That's not how that works. Okay. Right. So you you get it's ignorant of the way that people get access to substances and where they use substances.

478
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:32,440
Very few people use substances alone in their room. They use them in a social context.

479
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:37,530
They use them with their friends. Right. And so it's just completely ignorant of this.

480
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:44,530
So if they're convinced kids who are already not going to use drugs to really not use drugs, that's what it did,

481
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:50,950
because it had no impact on kids who were not, you know, otherwise not not inclined or otherwise inclined or not.

482
00:44:51,370 --> 00:44:57,279
And the reason this is important is that once I think it's embedded in the and especially in this case,

483
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:00,880
in an institution, in education, it's very, very hard to get it out.

484
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:07,570
In fact, you need more evidence that there doesn't work. Then you need the evidence that you need to show that there doesn't work,

485
00:45:07,870 --> 00:45:13,990
actually has to be stronger than the evidence that Dear had to provide that it does work, which was almost none.

486
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:15,790
It was just a good idea, right?

487
00:45:15,790 --> 00:45:23,650
So they got implemented on a this should work, but in order to get them out, you have to demonstrate convincingly that it does not work.

488
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:30,180
Right. And you probably have to have an alternative. So let me tell you about the alternative.

489
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:37,890
All right. So we're going to play this is a universal, effective, universal program to provide substance use to public.

490
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:51,080
The Good Behavior game was first fielded and a series in what became a series of large community based clinical trials done in Baltimore in 1985.

491
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:55,850
The target population of the game are first and second graders.

492
00:45:55,850 --> 00:45:59,090
These kids are six, seven, eight years old. How old are you out there?

493
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:03,010
I was 12, 13, 14. Middle school. Okay. So these kids are young.

494
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:10,370
These are six, seven, eight year olds. Okay. It is a classroom based strategy to decrease disruptive behavior and increase time on task.

495
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:13,880
Our goal is to address aggressive and shy behaviors.

496
00:46:14,930 --> 00:46:21,860
The way that this works is that children in the first grade are assigned to a group that's called a team within the classroom,

497
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:30,260
and that your whole team either earns points or gets demerits, essentially as a whole team.

498
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:38,840
So the whole team gains of a whole team loses and those can be redeemed for small prizes and you gradually delay the point reduction.

499
00:46:38,850 --> 00:46:42,350
So at the beginning it's like, okay, we're going to play for 5 minutes.

500
00:46:42,350 --> 00:46:47,160
And if we, if you do this well, then we're going to get an extra 5 minutes of recess in 20 minutes.

501
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:51,260
Right. So like a very short time between the effort and the gratification.

502
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:59,030
But then you can imagine it goes up into. All right. So if we if we play this and we get enough points, then the whole class can have a pizza party.

503
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:05,100
Okay. So this again, this is Ben.

504
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:10,979
This is trial. And this is one example of the randomized controlled trial flow chart.

505
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:14,640
So this is again in Baltimore. You had almost 700 kids entering the first grade.

506
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:20,000
They were then randomized to one of three classrooms within the school.

507
00:47:20,010 --> 00:47:23,499
The teachers were then randomized to which classroom they were going to teach.

508
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:27,720
So you've got randomization at the teacher level, randomization at the child level.

509
00:47:27,810 --> 00:47:31,860
Okay, so randomization to the classroom level and at the child level.

510
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:39,629
So we're really going to be able to isolate, see the impact of this intervention on later drug use.

511
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:44,100
Then these kids have been followed up. Now they're in their forties. These guys have been followed up since they were in first grade.

512
00:47:44,610 --> 00:47:48,480
But we need to play the good behavior again because it's probably hard to imagine. So we're going to play the good behavior.

513
00:47:49,350 --> 00:47:54,120
So first of all, we need to be on test. So I'd like us to question the first thing to break up into groups.

514
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:58,230
Okay. So we'll have a group here. Okay. And then a middle group here.

515
00:47:58,590 --> 00:48:02,399
Right. You're scaling up here and then over here. Okay. So this year, three teams.

516
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:06,900
If anybody in your team is off test or start the good behavior game, your whole team loses points.

517
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:12,100
And I've got a really nice Tesla that's not worth anything anymore. And you all have that.

518
00:48:12,930 --> 00:48:16,139
Okay, so what? Let's set up some rules for the good behavior. What mean?

519
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:21,440
What does it mean to be on task? What an on task behavior.

520
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:27,530
And attention. How do I know you're paying attention? I in eye contact.

521
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:34,590
What? It will help you have eye contact. Looking at other set of conditions.

522
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:45,180
So what might we all need to do? Well, what else would be okay?

523
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:52,670
What else might distractions might be out here? Oh, yes, your phone.

524
00:48:53,270 --> 00:49:01,070
So what would you recommend that we do here to keep on? What if somebody texts you?

525
00:49:01,190 --> 00:49:05,090
They are. You're all texting, right? It's really important.

526
00:49:06,830 --> 00:49:10,370
It's a really, really important one. What else?

527
00:49:16,190 --> 00:49:21,860
How am I? If you wanted to say something about my favorite thing for you to do. Raise your hands.

528
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:26,000
That's right. All right. So all right. So we're going to play the good behavior game. Now we're playing the game.

529
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:33,070
Okay. So we're going to set a timer here for 2 minutes and we're going to play the computer game on task.

530
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:40,170
Set the timer. The timer has to start again. So I know this feels silly.

531
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:49,180
But while we're sitting here, I want you to remember back to first grade.

532
00:49:52,470 --> 00:49:57,610
Your first grade teacher. His name? Raise your hand.

533
00:49:58,470 --> 00:50:01,780
First grade teacher? Yes, Miss Krauss. Miss Krauss.

534
00:50:01,870 --> 00:50:08,350
She sounds like sales. Oh, I'm sorry. What can you tell us about Mrs. Krauss?

535
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:19,150
Yeah, she's going to be in. But what? And when you go away in first grade, will they have a chart where it's like you move your.

536
00:50:19,710 --> 00:50:23,080
You like good behavior on top of everyone's good behavior.

537
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:27,360
But then if you get your magnet, move down if you like individuals.

538
00:50:27,430 --> 00:50:37,120
Yeah. Yeah. So your whole team on picture day, I got my magnet moved out because I wrote my answer to like the spelling bee thing before we said.

539
00:50:37,510 --> 00:50:40,810
Like she said, go. And it's a for memory.

540
00:50:42,550 --> 00:50:48,730
Like, I was like sobbing during that. People told me I had to I once had to stand against a wall for for running.

541
00:50:48,730 --> 00:50:53,050
And I was like, I was just skipping down.

542
00:50:53,550 --> 00:51:01,420
Yeah, I see. So. All right. So remember your first grade self, so you might have might have been hard for you to sit still.

543
00:51:01,660 --> 00:51:05,320
First grade might have been hard for you to stay on task during first grade.

544
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:13,300
You might have been looking out the window a lot in first grade or sort of like maybe you were having trouble reading or other things.

545
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:21,220
Maybe there are other things that were going on. Right? But the point is that most teachers jobs went for kindergarten, first and second grade.

546
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:30,640
It's just managing the chaos that is having 46, seven, eight year olds in most of their time is spent on classroom management.

547
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:38,770
And that's what this game is. This game is a way for a teacher to rather than punish individuals.

548
00:51:38,770 --> 00:51:43,270
We're not even right to reward whole teams for good behavior.

549
00:51:43,270 --> 00:51:48,620
So I might say, oh, she's great. Oh, what's that? So we're already done with our good behavior.

550
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:52,540
Hmm. So? So the teacher now. So what now?

551
00:51:52,540 --> 00:51:55,780
Let's imagine that you remind me.

552
00:51:56,080 --> 00:52:00,129
I'm sorry, Gina. So, Gina, let's say you get this.

553
00:52:00,130 --> 00:52:06,280
Your whole team gets this concurrence, let's say, for your, you know, writing this being to.

554
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:12,020
Ready to spell something. Now, how about in your whole team?

555
00:52:12,020 --> 00:52:19,530
Which is the point? How am I. Your teammates feel about that? Not great.

556
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:25,860
Okay. So what? And then what might you do to support Gina next time?

557
00:52:26,730 --> 00:52:32,270
We're playing a good behavior game. Redefine the role, play it.

558
00:52:32,810 --> 00:52:37,520
Make sure you do it, too. Yeah. See why you don't trust the rest of us all.

559
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:47,060
I mean, you wouldn't say that your first graders. You're not going to say it like that, but you be like you must was so and so.

560
00:52:47,070 --> 00:52:55,790
And what is it that is peer pressure. So the good behavior game supports self-regulation, which is you sort of stay on task through peer pressure.

561
00:52:56,630 --> 00:53:05,390
So now the problem is that for first, I'd say this is a 10th of the mother of a ten year old boy.

562
00:53:06,230 --> 00:53:09,110
The things that seven, eight year old boys are doing are not the same thing,

563
00:53:09,110 --> 00:53:13,160
that get them into trouble, are not the same things that six and ten year old girls get in trouble.

564
00:53:13,370 --> 00:53:17,530
So, like. Right. Talk to us through, like seven year old Ryan.

565
00:53:17,870 --> 00:53:24,020
You were really good at sitting still all the time. So you're up and about all the time, right?

566
00:53:24,050 --> 00:53:28,300
You might be like, what else? Like probably throwing parties. Yes. Yes, we have violence, right?

567
00:53:28,310 --> 00:53:32,520
So, like, little boys are young. Like, they're they're they're very up.

568
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:36,139
Like, these are the ones. And I'm saying this is somebody who was involved in my son's classroom occasionally.

569
00:53:36,140 --> 00:53:41,160
It's not just like all like they are eating paste, like they are certainly doing things.

570
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:42,380
You're like, what is happening?

571
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:52,970
So you can imagine how this type of peer pressure might be very helpful for young boys who are more likely to be engaging in these hyperactive,

572
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:59,450
kind of really off task behaviors than it is for young girls. And in fact, all of the criminal comes from the clinical trial data.

573
00:53:59,810 --> 00:54:02,629
And I say clinical just because I mean randomized. So it's not like in a clinic,

574
00:54:02,630 --> 00:54:09,730
but randomized controlled trial data show that the good behavior game has massive benefits for boys and almost no benefits for girls,

575
00:54:10,130 --> 00:54:17,100
and in some cases, girls. There are some evidence of the trial that girls are more likely to get randomized to this game.

576
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:21,300
This is the game are more likely to use drugs later on.

577
00:54:22,170 --> 00:54:25,300
Right. And they don't quite know the mechanism yet. But for boys, the data is unequivocal.

578
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:30,140
This prevents drug use for boys who are more likely to use strikes.

579
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:33,570
This prevents antisocial behavior. This prevents getting incarcerated.

580
00:54:33,690 --> 00:54:39,540
This prevents suicide, this intervention, this thing that we are doing right now, this works.

581
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:43,560
And I know that because it's been tested in multiple, multiple clinical trials.

582
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:47,459
So I'm not going to show you all the data on this. I guess I'll just bring you here.

583
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:53,580
This is from a review article that showed that among kids who got and you can see that there,

584
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:58,799
you can even you can see that again the idea that like not there's variation and to benefit.

585
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:05,730
So among all boys 19% of those kids this is all in inner city Baltimore.

586
00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:10,890
19% of those kids went on to develop drug use or dependance in the subsequent 20 years.

587
00:55:11,490 --> 00:55:17,520
That's half the amount of kids that were randomized at age seven to this intervention.

588
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:22,200
I told you could prevent half of drug. I mean, like this.

589
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:30,299
This is life changing. This is life changing. If you look at kids who are most aggressive in terms of their behavior, sort of like most acting out,

590
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:35,280
throwing things, maybe getting into fights already where it's now 30% compared to 83%.

591
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:39,240
I mean, this is life changing. Go down to smoking.

592
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:43,950
You see improvements. There's some evidence of improvement for both males and females.

593
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:49,889
Again, some evidence out here for suicide. But again, it's not it's not nearly as strong that we don't really understand why.

594
00:55:49,890 --> 00:55:54,690
And it's not it's not all the trials have shown benefit for girls.

595
00:55:54,690 --> 00:56:00,270
In fact, some of them have shown part. So I'll summarize here and then I'll leave you for the day.

596
00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:04,950
So this intervention, how much do we talk about drugs?

597
00:56:05,970 --> 00:56:09,330
It's not. And yet it prevents drug use.

598
00:56:10,820 --> 00:56:13,830
How much should we talk about suicide? None. And yet it prevents suicide.

599
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:18,000
How much should we talk about the criminal justice system? None. And yet it prevents people from getting incarcerated.

600
00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:24,460
Why? Because it's it's working on a mechanism around self-regulation and pro-social behavior,

601
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:27,760
which is a generic positive thing that helps you get through life.

602
00:56:28,690 --> 00:56:31,780
You are all very good at that. That's why you're here.

603
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:37,479
Right. And so the the but the environment that this classroom environment doesn't

604
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:40,389
help a lot if your kids in a wild classroom environment that's out of control,

605
00:56:40,390 --> 00:56:44,830
they're not able to actually develop the skills that they need in order to end up someday at the University of Michigan.

606
00:56:45,970 --> 00:56:50,230
And this helps that not by punishing anybody, not by teaching that drugs are bad,

607
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:54,820
but by teaching them how to be part of a team and be part of the community in the classroom in a safe space.

608
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:59,550
Okay. All right. So I will let you go.

609
00:56:59,610 --> 00:57:00,300
I'll see you on Wednesday.
