1
00:00:00,584 --> 00:00:04,590
In this session, we will discuss probability in genetics.

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:08,900
The learning objectives are to define the three laws of probability.

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:11,130
The law of mutually exclusive events.

4
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:14,840
The law of independent events, and the law of conditional events.

5
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:19,100
Then will calculate each type of event using the laws of probability.

6
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:24,021
And give examples of applying these laws of probability to the field of genetics.

7
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:31,180
There's some simple notation for probability that you should be aware of.

8
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:34,037
The probability of event A or

9
00:00:34,037 --> 00:00:39,650
B happening is called the probability of A union with B.

10
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:44,000
And it's annotated by this type of U symbol.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:52,710
So this here indicates the probability that event A or B is happening.

12
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,370
The probability of A and

13
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:59,940
B happening is called the probability of the intersection of those two events.

14
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:04,379
And it's annotated by this upside down, U simple.

15
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:09,811
The probability of event A conditional that event B has happened,

16
00:01:09,811 --> 00:01:15,633
is called the probability of A given B and it's annotated with the bar.

17
00:01:15,633 --> 00:01:16,481
First, we'll talk about mutually exclusive events.

18
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:25,290
If A and B are mutually exclusive, that means that if event A occurs,

19
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:32,390
B can't occur, or if B occurs, A can't occur, then they're mutually exclusive.

20
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:36,940
The probability of mutually exclusive events is given as follows.

21
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:42,010
The probability of A or B happening is equal to the probability that

22
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:46,731
event A happens, plus the probability that event B happens.

23
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:52,695
For example, if we're talking about a person having

24
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:57,430
a genotype at some particular gene, DD or Dd.

25
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:01,490
The person cannot have both of those genotype at the same time.

26
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:06,656
So the probability that the individual has genotype, DD or

27
00:02:06,656 --> 00:02:11,640
Dd, is the sum of those two independent probabilities.

28
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:17,990
The probability DD, plus the probability of Dd.

29
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:21,951
If the events A and B are not mutually exclusive,

30
00:02:21,951 --> 00:02:24,960
you need to use a different formula.

31
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:29,863
So if A and B can occur together, then the probability of A or

32
00:02:29,863 --> 00:02:34,485
B happening is equal to the probability of A happening.

33
00:02:34,485 --> 00:02:41,410
Plus the probability of B happening, minus the probability of both of them happening.

34
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:45,982
For example, if we're talking about a person's genotype

35
00:02:45,982 --> 00:02:50,286
at two different genes, say, the D gene and the E gene.

36
00:02:50,286 --> 00:02:55,487
That person could have some particular genotype at the D gene and

37
00:02:55,487 --> 00:02:59,592
they could have a different genotype at the E gene.

38
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:07,042
So the probability that an individual has a genotype DD at the D gene,

39
00:03:07,042 --> 00:03:11,635
or that they have genotype EE at the E gene.

40
00:03:11,635 --> 00:03:14,957
Is given as the probability DD,

41
00:03:14,957 --> 00:03:21,000
plus the probability of EE minus the probability of both.

42
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,298
So, let's look at that in a little bit more detail.

43
00:03:25,298 --> 00:03:30,113
Suppose we have the following data, here at the first locus or

44
00:03:30,113 --> 00:03:34,201
the first gene, you can have genotype DD, Dd, dd.

45
00:03:34,201 --> 00:03:41,350
The total number of people that have each of those genotypes are given here.

46
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:46,879
This is the number of persons with DD, Dd, dd and here's the total number of people.

47
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:51,547
Here at the second locus, you have three different genotypes,

48
00:03:51,547 --> 00:03:53,457
you could be EE, Ee or ee.

49
00:03:53,457 --> 00:03:59,341
And here's the total number of people with each of those genotypes.

50
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:09,075
So we can use these numbers to calculate the probability of EE and DD together.

51
00:04:09,075 --> 00:04:10,364
In this table, is an example of 1000 people who have different genotypes.

52
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:21,541
Each of these cells is giving the number of people with each of

53
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:23,601
the genotypes in question.

54
00:04:23,601 --> 00:04:29,352
So 74 people have the DD genotype at gene D and

55
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:32,960
the EE genotype at gene E.

56
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:38,077
So the probability that someone has a DD genotype is gonna be the total

57
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:44,190
number of people with that genotype over the total number of people in the sample.

58
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:49,340
So that would be 246 over 1000 or 0.246.

59
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:52,830
That's the probability of a DD genotype.

60
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:58,014
The probability of the EE genotype is going to be the total number of people,

61
00:04:58,014 --> 00:05:02,721
300 that have that genotype over 1000 or 1000 or 0.3.

62
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:09,390
Now, because these two genotypes are not mutually exclusive events.

63
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:17,387
We also have to calculate the probability of having both DD and EE genotype.

64
00:05:17,387 --> 00:05:21,710
That is, 74 over 1000 or 0.74.

65
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:27,760
So if we wanna know the probability that an individual has genotype,

66
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,799
DD, which is all of these people.

67
00:05:30,799 --> 00:05:35,015
Or EE, which is all of these people,

68
00:05:35,015 --> 00:05:40,456
we need the total probability of DD plus EE minus

69
00:05:40,456 --> 00:05:45,780
the probability of being in the DD and EE cell.

70
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,360
Because we don't want to count these people twice.

71
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,877
They're counted in the probability of being DD and

72
00:05:51,877 --> 00:05:54,094
in the probability of being EE.

73
00:05:54,094 --> 00:06:00,010
So we won't want to count them once, so we have to subtract that probability off.

74
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:04,658
So the probability that someone has DD or

75
00:06:04,658 --> 00:06:10,126
EE genotype, and it could be that they have both

76
00:06:10,126 --> 00:06:15,201
is 0.246 plus 0.3 minus 0.74.

77
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:21,114
If A and B are independent of each other.

78
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:23,602
Meaning that the fact that event A has occurred has no bearing on event B at all,

79
00:06:27,412 --> 00:06:32,870
or the fact that event B has occurred doesn't affect event A at all.

80
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:34,912
They're considered to be independent.

81
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,549
The probability of events A and

82
00:06:37,549 --> 00:06:42,480
B will then be the product of their two individual probabilities.

83
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:47,813
So, for example, if we've got this scenario where we're

84
00:06:47,813 --> 00:06:54,660
interested in people who have the genotype DD and they have the genotype EE.

85
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:59,512
So remember, the person's genotype at gene D should not

86
00:06:59,512 --> 00:07:03,270
have any effect on their genotype at gene E.

87
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:05,600
Because of independent assortment.

88
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,250
So, here these are independent events.

89
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:13,331
So what we do, is we can calculate the probability of someone having both of

90
00:07:13,331 --> 00:07:18,773
these genotypes as the product of their probabilities of each one of them alone.

91
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:23,748
The probability that someone has genotype DD and

92
00:07:23,748 --> 00:07:29,139
EE is the probability DD times the probability of EE.

93
00:07:29,139 --> 00:07:35,538
Which from the example we saw before is 0.246 times 0.3 or 0.74.

94
00:07:36,684 --> 00:07:40,730
Finally, we wanna understand what happens when

95
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:44,890
probabilities are conditional upon each other.

96
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:50,751
So, if A and B are not independent and in fact knowing something about

97
00:07:50,751 --> 00:07:57,535
event A gives you information about how likely event B is to occur or vice versa.

98
00:07:57,535 --> 00:08:02,700
Then we need to use the formula for conditional probability.

99
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:07,652
So that says, the probability of both A and B occurring is equal

100
00:08:07,652 --> 00:08:12,603
to the probability of event A times the probability of event B,

101
00:08:12,603 --> 00:08:15,416
given that A has already occurred.

102
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:20,495
That's equal to the probability of event B times the probability of event A,

103
00:08:20,495 --> 00:08:22,860
given that B has already occurred.

104
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:28,008
So for example, maybe we wanna know the probability

105
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:32,805
of any person inheriting a D allele from his mom,

106
00:08:32,805 --> 00:08:38,080
given the fact that his mom is heterozygous, right?

107
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,750
So, if we wanna know the probability of inheriting a D allele

108
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:47,431
from a heterozygous mother, we use the following formula.

109
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:53,482
The probability that mom is a heterozygote times the probability of

110
00:08:53,482 --> 00:08:59,308
the kid inheriting a particular allele, given that the mom is heterozygous.

111
00:08:59,308 --> 00:09:04,344
The probability of inheriting this D is conditional

112
00:09:04,344 --> 00:09:09,570
on the fact that mom is heterozygous, Dd, right?

113
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:12,757
The probability of a kid inheriting a D,

114
00:09:12,757 --> 00:09:17,651
would be different if his mom was, for example, DD, right?

115
00:09:17,651 --> 00:09:19,733
So this is a conditional probability.

116
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:25,940
One extension of conditional probabilities is the law of total probability.

117
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:31,144
So here, we have this annotation, the probability

118
00:09:31,144 --> 00:09:36,704
of A happening given B is equal to the probability of A and

119
00:09:36,704 --> 00:09:42,997
B happening, divided by the probability that B has happened.

120
00:09:42,997 --> 00:09:48,174
Here, if the event B has to result in one of K mutually

121
00:09:48,174 --> 00:09:53,140
exclusive events, which we're going to call C.

122
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:58,679
C are all the mutually exclusive events that could happen in the probability of B.

123
00:09:58,679 --> 00:10:04,200
Then the total probability says, we've got the probability of event B.

124
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:08,140
That's equal to the probability of C1 happening,

125
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:11,821
times the probability that B happens given C1.

126
00:10:11,821 --> 00:10:17,194
Plus the probability that C2 happens, times the probability of B given C2.

127
00:10:17,194 --> 00:10:20,686
Plus all of the other potential options for

128
00:10:20,686 --> 00:10:24,421
C times their conditional probabilities.

129
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:28,980
This is probably easier to think about given an example.

130
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:32,922
So here, we're gonna try to calculate the probability that some

131
00:10:32,922 --> 00:10:36,190
individual inherits D allele from his mom.

132
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:41,146
Well, the probability of inheriting a D allele from mom depends

133
00:10:41,146 --> 00:10:43,440
on the genotype of the mom.

134
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:50,070
So here the genotype of the mom is event B.

135
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:55,878
There are three mutually exclusive genotypes that the mom could have.

136
00:10:55,878 --> 00:11:02,390
She could be Dd, heterozygous, she could be DD or she could be dd.

137
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:05,310
Mom has to be one of these three genotypes.

138
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:08,491
So these are C1, C2 and C3.

139
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:14,680
Each of these conditional probabilities, is the probability that the child

140
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:19,460
inherits the D allele given that mom is one of those particular genotypes.

141
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:24,661
So the total probability of the individual inheriting

142
00:11:24,661 --> 00:11:29,650
the D allele from mom, is the probability mom is Dd.

143
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:34,420
Times the probability of inheriting D given that mom is Dd.

144
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:37,700
Plus the probability mom is DD,

145
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:43,790
times the probability of inheriting D given that mom is DD.

146
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:47,811
Plus the same thing for when mom is dd.
