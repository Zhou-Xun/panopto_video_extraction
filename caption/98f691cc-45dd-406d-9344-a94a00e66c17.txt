1
00:00:05,372 --> 00:00:08,640
In this module we're going to talk
about data collection methods.

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:12,190
Basically, I'm going to talk about the
tools you need in order to figure out how

3
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:15,370
to answer the research questions
that you want to answer.

4
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:19,255
I think, really, qualitative methods,
this is where it gets really exciting.

5
00:00:19,255 --> 00:00:21,558
And you have kind of
a better appreciation for

6
00:00:21,558 --> 00:00:24,951
the utility of qualitative research
methods when we begin to think

7
00:00:24,951 --> 00:00:29,490
about the innovative approaches we can
use to answer our research questions.

8
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:33,553
In my own qualitative research I employ
a variety of data collection methods, in

9
00:00:33,553 --> 00:00:37,693
order to really think about the best ways
to answer the research questions I have.

10
00:00:37,693 --> 00:00:42,003
To think about whom I should to, talk to,
or what I should look at, in order to gain

11
00:00:42,003 --> 00:00:45,252
a really deeper understanding
of the public health problem or

12
00:00:45,252 --> 00:00:47,240
public health topic.

13
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:51,450
In this module I'm going to talk
about the three most common

14
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:53,790
data collection methods
we use in public health.

15
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:58,680
Those are in-depth interviews,
focus group discussions, and observations.

16
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,130
This module has two learning objectives.

17
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:05,072
The first is to learn about the most
common types of data collection methods in

18
00:01:05,072 --> 00:01:08,652
qualitative research, and
the second is to assess the suitability of

19
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:13,573
different data collection methods for
a study design.
