1
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:08,490
Okay. Let's let's proceed with today's class again.

2
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:15,750
The whole point of these class is just for me to introduce what's going on in the next seven weeks and then for us to get into a bit of material.

3
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:23,910
And this is like a bit of a soft introduction into, you know, what is this class is is all about.

4
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:30,749
Okay. So my name is Abram Wagner. You can just call me Abram if you want to call me Dr. Wagner.

5
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:38,639
Professor Wagner, that is totally fine. I do scheduling of my office hours, so here's a link.

6
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,770
But this link is also on canvas and it's also in the syllabus. So please take advantage of that.

7
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:51,720
And you know, I'd love to chat with you about homework or just about life in general, about your careers, about epidemiology or public health.

8
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:59,280
If none of this works, you know, obviously email me and we'll find another time to meet, I tell you.

9
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:04,109
Okay, with that, I'm not tenure track, so I'm research faculty, actually.

10
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:08,010
So I'm to be an instructor. I'm actually appointed through the union.

11
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:14,790
We don't have a lot of of like union lecturers in our department, but there are a few.

12
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:18,560
But I just want to let you know, because I'm different than a lot of the other train tracks.

13
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:26,680
Just a few things to get started. I realize that we're kind of in the swing of things in the middle of the semester, but,

14
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:35,380
you know, life can be really tough and I hope that you realize there are resources out there.

15
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:46,239
So, you know, Caps is one of those. I highly recommend it if if you are going through some hard times financially,

16
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,770
if you have some difficulties and who isn't, you know, tuition is really expensive.

17
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:56,140
There is a food pantry operated out of the out of the university.

18
00:01:56,140 --> 00:02:00,490
So and, you know, that's that's very discreet. But please take advantage of that.

19
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:04,479
So okay, so on to this class.

20
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,190
This is going to be the weekly schedule.

21
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:14,710
So I will be talking from 1 to 250, but there will be a combination of the lecturing and small group assignments.

22
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:23,680
I'll try to have a ten minute break around the halfway point, and then I have an assignment which is due for most weeks.

23
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:32,229
It's due on Sunday night and the reason why I have a due on Sunday night is that so that your GCE

24
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:40,510
noon and I can look it over on Monday and Tuesday before class just to see if there's any big,

25
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:48,399
any, any big problems. That being said, do you all I am sure he is a friendly face just because she was also your GSI first.

26
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:55,480
633. But he is our producer. Yeah, I'm sure most of you already have been.

27
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:00,940
Seven 4834. At the.

28
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:07,240
You. Thanks.

29
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:11,950
Oh, so again, our assignment is do Sunday night.

30
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:15,819
And then there is a reading quiz which is due right before class.

31
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:20,020
And obviously we didn't have a reading quiz first day, but for all the other weeks there will be one.

32
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:24,520
So please complete that before the first class.

33
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:30,700
Oh, so this is the typical class structure.

34
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:39,280
Every week will kind of have a cohesive introduction to one contemporary method, you know, that is the title of this class.

35
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:43,220
So before class you will read a paper on that contemporary method.

36
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:49,750
Then during class I'll give you a bit of methodological background, and then you will,

37
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:53,160
in your small groups, kind of discuss some of the nitty gritty of that method.

38
00:03:53,530 --> 00:04:02,319
We'll go back and forth a few times and then after class there for most weeks there is going to be an assignment and you can either complete

39
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:12,010
it in our or SAS and it is just like a simple and maybe even a simplified example of that contemporary method that we are going over.

40
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:20,229
So again, the whole idea here is that, you know, I am just giving you a taste of,

41
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:26,740
of all these new methods which maybe you maybe you've heard a bit about in other classes or maybe even read about,

42
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:30,880
but maybe you don't really understand how to do or how to implement them.

43
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:34,749
So I think the whole point of this class is for me to give you a bit of background

44
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:40,150
and let you kind of play around with with these with these new methods.

45
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:44,080
The after class assignments are not meant to be super difficult.

46
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:51,700
There is much more of a focus on just like interpreting the results and getting the basics of the method down.

47
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:55,150
And I'm not. It's really just like filling in a few holes in the code.

48
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:58,720
So it's really me holding your hands as you're doing the assignment.

49
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:04,060
It's not meant to be like gotcha type of questions or meant to be like really complicated.

50
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:14,290
And again, I provide the code in SAS or are feel free to use whatever language you want if you want to do it in Stata or you know, I, I don't care.

51
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,440
Okay. So I think this is kind of what I was talking about before.

52
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:24,980
We are going to be introducing each week a new contemporary method.

53
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:30,010
So today we're just going to go over generalized linear models and just kind of measures of association in general.

54
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:38,149
This is a bit more of a review. We will, in future classes, start to talk about causal inference, marginal structural models,

55
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:43,130
mediation analysis, quantitative bias analysis and better analysis.

56
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:47,000
So that is what we are going to be doing throughout this class.

57
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:53,899
And I think through all of this, I want us to think about what I would consider the culture of epidemiology,

58
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:58,260
because I do think our field kind of has it has a culture to it.

59
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:03,050
You know, we have a set we that we do things, we have a language, we have a history.

60
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:10,879
And I think some of that is is good and some of that reflects some strong

61
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,450
methodological advancements which have occurred throughout the past few decades.

62
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:22,310
But I do think that there can be some some racism, some classism which seeps into our analysis.

63
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:32,630
And I want us to kind of unearth those and to think about them and to be more thoughtful, maybe in our in our future.

64
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:41,950
So, I mean, I, I would hope that through this class, this might be helpful for your own early projects,

65
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:47,300
if I would assume most of you are second year master's students. It could be helpful for that.

66
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:53,540
It could be helpful for like a research assistantship that you have. But, you know, I do want to leave you with some basic information.

67
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:58,640
So in the future, if you do see something about a marginal structure model or like a mediation analysis,

68
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:05,180
maybe you don't remember everything from this class, but you have like notes to go back to or you kind of have like a base level of understanding.

69
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:13,340
Okay. So what I would love for you to do.

70
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:21,290
Well, let me actually first introduce my. The canvas side.

71
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:29,089
Okay. So on the canvas, say there are a few things.

72
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:35,690
The barn, a lot of weeds will be doing full. Every quizzes which aren't graded but just are ways for me to get some feedback from you.

73
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:43,230
So that is here if you just want a direct link to it for your small group discussions there.

74
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:48,590
I do have a Google drive available for you. And again, we'll have more small group stuff later on.

75
00:07:48,590 --> 00:08:00,460
But just so you're situated with it, there is all these group names and I would love for you to rename these to whatever you call your group.

76
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:08,590
So it could be like group B and then, you know, like, whatever your names. So next time we have a group assignment, please do that.

77
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:14,430
So this is just a way for you to organize some of your thoughts.

78
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,840
You know, I look through these occasionally, but I'm not like grading you on completion of them.

79
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:22,960
This is just a way for you to put some of your thoughts that you've come up with as a group.

80
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:29,640
Donna, Donna. People. Okay.

81
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:36,510
So and then in each week I have links to everything.

82
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:40,229
You know, if there was before class reading or a quiz in the quizzes generally, you know,

83
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:51,150
based on this reading that you'd have to do, I have slides available for you and I have an assignment.

84
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:59,999
Okay, so what I'm what I would love for you to do now and this is more so something that you could do a bit individually,

85
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,719
but just take like 5 minutes and I have this really long link here and obviously I doubt that you're going to be typing that in.

86
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:21,090
But if you go to the, you know, the whole page of canvas and then click on the This Google Drive and then click on the week one policies.

87
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:29,580
I would love for you just to fill in a few things, and this is for me to kind of get to know your learning styles a bit better.

88
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:33,700
You know, feel free to write whatever ends.

89
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,209
I will leave you like a bit of time right now to do this,

90
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:41,040
but I'll kind of be looking at this over the course of the week, so feel free to add stuff on after class.

91
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:47,670
I promise. I'm not going to try to like look through the edits to see who wrote what, you know, feel free to be pretty honest.

92
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:54,740
But yeah, let me give you a few minutes and please, please.

93
00:09:55,060 --> 00:10:05,650
Going to. When viewers began to notice the great.

94
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:18,280
I'll also be going around today and just friends like put people's needs to their face.

95
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:26,730
So that's just, you know, and if you would prefer to be called something else, please do take your time.

96
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:31,239
No, no, you can't go into that. There's just too many. You can.

97
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:35,460
You could. I really need, like, more students to be here on the front.

98
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:41,350
And I don't mean to be singling out you, but, like, that's like, I need one or two more students here in the front.

99
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,600
So sorry for, like, the disruption, but.

100
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:50,160
But, yeah, if you have, like, another name that you'd like to be called, please just, like, cross it off and, like, write something.

101
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:08,710
Oh, yeah. Thank you for making this.

102
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:18,330
I think that's right.

103
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:29,560
All right. Everything.

104
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:38,410
Well. But this time.

105
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:57,140
I think that. Yeah.

106
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:14,390
Yeah, yeah, that's. There's a lot of.

107
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:39,630
Actually, I think I said, yeah, I think you're.

108
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:49,310
And. You said.

109
00:12:54,260 --> 00:13:02,980
Although I know that. That's part of their fight against something they're.

110
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:23,020
That's an area. I want to make sure.

111
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:32,880
Yes, sir. I'm Mr.

112
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:42,660
Is being recognized for.

113
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:04,040
Yeah. Yeah, that's a good point.

114
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:16,930
And that plus. She?

115
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:38,270
What happens? Past.

116
00:14:43,570 --> 00:15:04,310
But we need to be. I have.

117
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:17,860
They're not going to be around to.

118
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:26,260
There has. Highly recommended.

119
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:46,880
That's what we heard. Health.

120
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:57,790
I was. That's your business.

121
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:24,970
American. Yeah.

122
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:47,530
Okay. So I'll give you, like, one or two more minutes. 130 will come back.

123
00:16:49,150 --> 00:17:07,950
Oh. Absolutely.

124
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:26,230
Exactly. Yeah.

125
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:32,030
Yeah. Well, I didn't mean that it was the idea.

126
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:40,980
Is a reason for that.

127
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:46,660
I mean, I think we can come back together.

128
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:57,550
So one thing I will, you know, feel free to be putting stuff on here over the course of the next week just because I understand that,

129
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:05,230
you know, maybe some thoughts come to you later or maybe you don't have a computer with you now, which is totally fine.

130
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:14,830
And then, you know, I'll try to respond to this like a bit more later, but I will.

131
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:23,469
So like a few things I think students are wondering about the mandatory attendance and like the work amount for this class.

132
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:29,950
And this happens perennially, like every low populace is a team that makes me hungry.

133
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:34,299
And that that's also another thing people are wondering about food and stuff.

134
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:39,490
I will say like, I am happy for people to come in here and like eat lunch if you want to.

135
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:45,550
I think this is one of the rooms where we're like theoretically allowed to do that, so please do that.

136
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:55,990
So working backwards, if you have an issue where you're not able to attend class, just let me know.

137
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:03,610
And I think this kind of goes into maybe my point about attendance.

138
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,620
So I do require attendance. And, you know, I'm sure you have questions like why is attendance required?

139
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:12,459
Attendance is required because, you know, if I don't require it,

140
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:17,500
then like half the class doesn't show up and then like the small group discussions just don't work in the same way.

141
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:25,630
And that's just what happened last year when with the flexible hybrid option, that is that's what happened.

142
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:31,120
And I want to make this like a high value class and I'm just not able to do it through a hybrid option.

143
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:35,800
Now, there are some students and hopefully you're listening online if you are one of those who,

144
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:39,969
you know, we switch the time of this class versus other years.

145
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:46,200
So there are like a few students who have like a mandatory other class and severe able to just like use the Panopto recordings.

146
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:51,429
Um, one of the reasons why I am trying not to have, like,

147
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:59,440
I'm trying to make that as an option little used just because, you know, this class runs for 2 hours.

148
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:07,680
And if you know anything about pedagogy and teaching it online class or an asynchronous class like a two hour long recording is not great.

149
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:15,820
That's like, not what you're supposed to do. But like, I'm right now, I, you know, I am paid to teach one class.

150
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,550
And so I'm trying to make that like an in-person class,

151
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:24,730
like a hybrid option or an online option would just be like an entirely different class, which, you know, would be interesting to do.

152
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:31,270
But it's just not the format that I can provide right now. But let's say, you know, attendance, I'm trying to be flexible,

153
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:39,070
so please do reach out if you're not able to attend, you know, the earlier I know the better.

154
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:45,730
But there's a few things that are happening. So one, who did you pass around the attendance sheet already?

155
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:52,120
Okay. So every week here will or I will pass around the sheet so that you can start doing that.

156
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:59,319
It'll just be like a sheet for you to sign in. So, you know, we have class every week between now and December 6th,

157
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:08,680
but there are a couple of of times where you might be thinking like, Oh, I don't want to show up for class synchronously.

158
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:14,950
So one is election day. So Election Day is sort of I have a blanket policy where you just don't either come to class that day.

159
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:20,710
I hope you do in the sense that I'll be here like I voted absentee and early.

160
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:27,610
But if you do not want to do that, if you want to vote in person or if you just don't want to show up to class that day, that's okay.

161
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:32,680
But we'll have a fun time here on that day for whoever does show up.

162
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:38,050
And then you do get one freebie where you don't need to tell me.

163
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:41,470
You don't need to tell him or me that you're missing class.

164
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:47,469
But if there's just a day where you do not want to end, and maybe that's the week before Thanksgiving,

165
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:51,040
you know, we do have class that Tuesday prior to Thanksgiving.

166
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:55,990
And if that's just a time that you don't want to attend, that's totally fine.

167
00:21:56,230 --> 00:22:05,800
I don't you know, I don't need to know why, but you're just allowed to have one session where you don't attend in addition to the Election Day.

168
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:12,880
But if there's like additional days beyond that, like, of course, you can just, you know, email me ahead of time.

169
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,960
And it's like, if I have any concerns, I'll let you know.

170
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:26,200
But that's just something like you. I think that's more of like an individual one on one, and there is no in-person final.

171
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:34,270
So the last day of class will be or the less like in-person thing that you will need to be here for would be December six.

172
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:42,430
The final for this class is due on December 15th.

173
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:52,750
Gigging at some point through campus. So, you know, students do have I do get concerns that students have about like the work in this class.

174
00:22:53,980 --> 00:23:04,240
And I think, you know, at this point in time, you've taken three other module courses or maybe most of you have from last year and previously.

175
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:08,440
And I think each of them kind of has their own way that they're being taught

176
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:14,110
and their own style of like homework and assignments and things like that.

177
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:27,100
My own perspective is that this is a two hour a week class and from university guidelines for every hour the class is taught in person,

178
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,970
there can be like 2 to 3 hours of extra work outside of class.

179
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:36,280
I do not think anyone will be spending six weeks or 6 hours outside of class doing stuff.

180
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:43,570
I really think, you know, it's in between 1 to 3 hours and that's what I've seen across like pulls, which I get.

181
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:47,650
But certainly, you know, if you find that you're spending a lot of time on stuff,

182
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:53,230
I'm I'm happy to meet with you and talk about your individual circumstances.

183
00:23:55,610 --> 00:24:04,010
Okay. And yeah. So I will look through some of your other concerns that you might have.

184
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:09,200
Um. Yeah.

185
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:13,260
I think, you know, a big part of this class is like the small group discussions.

186
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:20,909
And, you know, my personal my my personal thing is I don't like calling out an individual student to respond to something,

187
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:26,280
but sometimes I'll go around and have like, Oh, can this group say something or can this group say something?

188
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:30,149
So then, you know, and during each discussion,

189
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:37,200
I will ask you to kind of think about who would be a point person to responding to any questions that I might have.

190
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:44,489
Okay, um, any questions on the attendance?

191
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:49,620
I'll look through more in detail, like the concerns you have, and I'm happy to respond to those a bit more in depth.

192
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:52,920
But while I have you here, any questions about these?

193
00:24:56,300 --> 00:25:01,730
Okay. So the assignments are mostly I would call them tutorials.

194
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:08,299
They're not trying it again, it's not trying to be like anything too difficult, but please reach out.

195
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:12,050
And that's all to say that if you're having trouble with it, reach out to me or hey,

196
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:18,320
you'd as soon as possible, because we're here to kind of get you through assignments.

197
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:24,200
You can definitely do it in groups. You can do with your group mates, you can do with friends.

198
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,760
So certainly discuss with other people, but you you have to severe.

199
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:36,649
And I think the assignments are also designed, you know, in public health in most of the careers that you'll be going into,

200
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:38,990
you'll be working in teams, you'll be working with other people.

201
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:50,250
And so I think it's great for you to, you know, work in teams with other people, with other people around.

202
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:54,230
So that's that's totally fine. I think that this is reflective of how the real world works.

203
00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:07,870
Okay. So late submission. So all of these sizes have their due dates on canvas.

204
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:15,510
Um, so, you know, I. I don't have additional information for you beyond what is here.

205
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:19,380
I think I checked to make sure that everything is right.

206
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:26,220
But, for instance, uh, the week five assignment, I'm not having a do over the Thanksgiving break.

207
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:30,900
I'm giving you extra time to work on that. So that is due at a, at a later date.

208
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,980
Um, but that just means there will be two assignments which are due one.

209
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:41,440
But, you know, all this time it's are, are open right now all three quizzes are open right now.

210
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:48,750
The only thing which isn't open is the final so late submission.

211
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:56,970
I do allow late submissions on assignments. So across all of the assignments, you can submit them in total 48 hours late.

212
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:04,770
So you could submit like the first assignment, 44 hours late and then all the other assignments like 30 minutes late and that would be totally fine.

213
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:13,050
Or each one you could submit like 10 hours late. You know, it's just cumulatively you could submit them for you hours sleep.

214
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:19,470
I mean, you don't need to email me or even if you're submitted, get late, like we'll be able to kind of count those hours ourselves.

215
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:23,350
This is just, you know, I understand things get in the way.

216
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:30,210
I also understand, you know, I have assignments due at midnight and if you submitted at like 1201 in the morning, that's that's fine.

217
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:36,150
I don't I don't care about that. But if you submit assignments after this period, you just dock.

218
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:42,790
You take. I do also allow for you to make up points on the assignment.

219
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:53,900
So if you get points taken off in the assignment, then there is a makeup sheet and that is under the assignments tab that's already available.

220
00:27:53,900 --> 00:28:05,090
And basically you will you will submit this document detailing like what week you got something wrong,

221
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:13,550
how many points you got it off and you know what your what a revision or what the correct answer should be.

222
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:21,319
But you also need to kind of you need to explain or, you know, you can't just like write out what the original or what the correct answer is.

223
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:28,910
You need to like provide a bit more on it. But this is all to say, this is just due by the end of the semester.

224
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:35,390
So you don't need to do this. Like, I mean, I think it makes sense to do it every week as your assignments are coming in, as they're being graded.

225
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:40,340
But you can just hand this in by the end of the semester. That's totally that is totally fine.

226
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:49,730
Yeah. And you can just put all of this together. Okay.

227
00:28:53,730 --> 00:29:00,850
The final exam is the only thing. Well, this is the thing that you need to do on your own.

228
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:04,570
And this is given out like the last day of class. I opened it up.

229
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:11,050
That's December six and it's due during our final exam period, which is December 15th, I believe.

230
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:19,780
And this is the thing which is which, you know, you need to do on your own.

231
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:26,140
And the idea here is that the final exam is not going to be, you know, interpreting.

232
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:32,440
It's not going to be you running code. It's not supposed to be super detailed.

233
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:36,670
It's more of like a broad overview of the concepts that we discuss in class.

234
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:43,420
And at the end of each slide deck, I have a study guide for the final exam.

235
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:46,810
And it's basically the types of questions which I would ask.

236
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:55,190
And then beyond that, every day, except for today, I will ask some questions at the beginning of the class period.

237
00:29:55,210 --> 00:30:01,000
Those are on pole everywhere. Those are ungraded. But those are very similar to the types of questions that I would ask everyone, for example.

238
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:09,339
So, you know, I want to talk like a moment about ethics, because I think ethics and public health are really important because, you know,

239
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:18,460
you might end up in a job where you are in charge of a surveillance system and you are looking at like if there's an uptick in certain cases,

240
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:27,700
in a certain area, you might have to be, you know, moving data between different research teams.

241
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:32,110
And it could include, like some personally identifiable information.

242
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:36,610
So there's a lot of things where ethics and public health intersect.

243
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:44,740
And I think it's really important for our for for you to kind of adhere to

244
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:49,090
your own what develop your own code of ethics and think about what is right,

245
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:56,620
what is wrong and how that relates to our classes. Like, I'm not going to be, you know, standing behind you as you do the final exam.

246
00:30:57,310 --> 00:31:02,680
So, you know, I'm telling you that you can't talk to other people about it like you can talk to me.

247
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:11,020
You've talked to here, you can look at your assignments. You can try to Google answers online, although I try to make it so that, you know,

248
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:17,200
it's not just like Google answers, but, you know, it's open, open, internet, open instructor.

249
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:21,940
But you can't talk to other people. But like, I won't know if you're talking to other people or not.

250
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:33,309
But, you know, I, I want you to feel good about where you are ethically that like you can do a final exam where you complete it individually.

251
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:41,230
And I think that leads to a life where you will, you know, perform ethically in your own job.

252
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:45,340
And I think we've seen breaches of this, like I with the Flint water crisis.

253
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:52,480
I think there were people in environmental health and public health who just were not reporting things that were kind of like hushing things up.

254
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:55,360
And, you know, but I would say behaving not so ethically.

255
00:31:56,560 --> 00:32:02,380
And this isn't to say that they were like cheating on their final exams in grad school, but maybe they were okay.

256
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:10,360
But, you know, if you have questions about stuff, just like let me know that, hey, you know the other thing.

257
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:16,630
So here is the person who will be grading your assignments.

258
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:22,120
But please, if you have questions about the grading, let me know.

259
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:33,339
So I don't want you to, you know, reach out to you about like I mean, certainly you could ask her, like, I don't understand this question.

260
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:37,059
Can you explain to me that's relevant? But it shouldn't be like, oh, I got five points off.

261
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:45,640
Can you only give me two months off? Because if you have that kind of greedy take questions, come to me and I'm happy to talk with you about it.

262
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:49,690
And again, I have like the make up so that you can, you can gain those points back.

263
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:55,599
Of course, if like, hey, you just like added up things wrong, you can, you can talk to her about that.

264
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:02,290
But like if there's a substantive question about, like, I don't think I should have gotten this many points off come to me and I'm happy.

265
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:07,660
I'm happy to talk to you about it. It's just like I don't want you to have that question with the GSI, but that's a question.

266
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:20,270
Okay. Any question on kind of how the course is set up or anything about.

267
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:30,810
Okay. I will. This the next part is kind of getting into the meat of the discussion.

268
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:35,909
Why don't we take our time to break now? We'll come back at 155.

269
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:39,719
So, you know, I maybe this is a bit performative, but I do think it's important.

270
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:43,049
Just like stand up, walk around a bit. A two hour long class is a lot.

271
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:49,801
So we'll be back into. Low and middle classes sorts through that school.

272
00:33:55,837 --> 00:34:03,996
Okay. So today we are going to be talking about generalized linear models or Glenn and this is to output absolute and difference measures.

273
00:34:03,997 --> 00:34:08,077
And again, we're going to be talking about all of these in more detail.

274
00:34:08,527 --> 00:34:19,927
Um, so probably like the takeaway from this and I'm using, you know, ugly colors, ugly fonts is to be cautious about using odds ratios,

275
00:34:19,927 --> 00:34:27,096
maybe saying do not use is like a bit broad but I think, you know, we have you in your bio stats class and what is it?

276
00:34:27,097 --> 00:34:32,647
602 Last year I think you probably practiced a lot with odds ratios and then

277
00:34:32,647 --> 00:34:37,447
even with your bio stats this year and logistic regression models are great,

278
00:34:38,017 --> 00:34:40,107
they can be you. We're going to be talking throughout this class.

279
00:34:40,117 --> 00:34:49,297
What were some of like really good points for us to be using logistic regression models because they but they're kind of like the simple things which,

280
00:34:49,897 --> 00:34:57,037
you know, were first, it's one of the first regression models which were coded for in statistical packages back in the day, like decades ago.

281
00:34:57,457 --> 00:35:02,286
And I think because they were so available so early on,

282
00:35:02,287 --> 00:35:09,037
we've just kind of used them so much in the intervening period without thinking thoughtfully about maybe we should be doing something else.

283
00:35:09,967 --> 00:35:14,017
Okay. So again, take a take home message, a takeaway message right now,

284
00:35:15,067 --> 00:35:22,117
do not use odds ratios unless it's really if you have a case control study like we love odds ratios for case control studies,

285
00:35:22,747 --> 00:35:27,817
if you have a really rare outcome, you might be able to approximate an odds ratio to be a risk ratio or you know,

286
00:35:27,907 --> 00:35:33,486
under certain types of sampling, you could approximate to rate ratio, logistic regression models.

287
00:35:33,487 --> 00:35:36,726
Again, these are some of the earlier things with reprogram,

288
00:35:36,727 --> 00:35:45,157
but they also sometimes they work better, sometimes other types of models have convergence issues.

289
00:35:46,267 --> 00:35:52,687
So if you in the future you're trying to do like a fancy class regression or some sort of like negative binomial or something.

290
00:35:53,377 --> 00:35:58,777
And if you keep getting like an error message back from the program, just saying like, oh, there's no convergence.

291
00:35:59,287 --> 00:36:05,407
Um, there might be a scientists who end up using odds ratio because it's, it's generally simpler to,

292
00:36:06,607 --> 00:36:13,357
it's simpler to compute the equations for the in the background which the, the statistical program is doing.

293
00:36:14,587 --> 00:36:20,046
Okay. So and what we'll talk more about today but like why we don't like odds ratios but this is just you know,

294
00:36:20,047 --> 00:36:24,487
for me to prime you and say that like maybe we shouldn't be using them as much.

295
00:36:26,437 --> 00:36:31,537
So let's take a few steps back and think about like measures of association and causality generally.

296
00:36:31,537 --> 00:36:38,407
We have like exposure and we have an outcome and that's what we're really interested in, in epidemiology and the exposure.

297
00:36:38,407 --> 00:36:42,757
Often times you might think of it as the dependent variable, the explanatory variable.

298
00:36:43,417 --> 00:36:46,347
That could be a risk factor. If it kind of has a negative effect on health,

299
00:36:46,357 --> 00:36:52,057
it could be a preventive factor if we think it's beneficial and an outcome is something that's a dependent variable.

300
00:36:52,327 --> 00:36:55,777
It could be a disease, but it could be a health status. Know doesn't need to be a negative thing.

301
00:36:56,977 --> 00:37:00,697
So that is these are the things that we're we're interested in.

302
00:37:01,537 --> 00:37:06,186
And in this class, we're going to focus on dichotomous measures, you know,

303
00:37:06,187 --> 00:37:11,587
like you have a disease or you don't or you have a vaccine or you don't or you have a drug or not.

304
00:37:12,467 --> 00:37:14,677
Certainly life is much more complicated than that.

305
00:37:14,677 --> 00:37:22,387
And, you know, people could have like a range of different exposures and it could be ordinal or it could be, you know, some other type of measurement.

306
00:37:23,437 --> 00:37:28,957
But we're going to simplify things for this class and we're pretty predominantly just going be focusing on dichotomous things.

307
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:33,816
But again, that might be going back to what is talking about with cultural issues like in epidemiology.

308
00:37:33,817 --> 00:37:38,136
We love dichotomous variables. We love like you either have something or you don't.

309
00:37:38,137 --> 00:37:47,557
We don't like these gray areas in between. And I think a lot of life is are those careers but sweeping that's designed for dichotomous measures.

310
00:37:47,557 --> 00:37:52,956
We could have relative measures or absolute measures. Relative measures are kind of on a multiplicative scale.

311
00:37:52,957 --> 00:37:56,317
The ratio measures this is are kind of all synonymous terms.

312
00:37:56,767 --> 00:37:59,797
And we could think of a risk ratio, we could think of a rate ratio.

313
00:38:00,037 --> 00:38:04,297
That's certainly an odds ratio. We also think about prevalence ratio.

314
00:38:05,137 --> 00:38:09,606
What I'm trying to suggest here by having this be like a subset is that risk ratios and

315
00:38:09,607 --> 00:38:13,867
prevalence ratios are calculated pretty much the same way in a statistical program.

316
00:38:14,257 --> 00:38:21,456
It's just that in a risk ratio we are assuming that the exposure happened temporally before the outcome or is in a prevalence ratio.

317
00:38:21,457 --> 00:38:31,776
These are measured at the same time. So say we have a study and we're interested in is the COVID 19 vaccine.

318
00:38:31,777 --> 00:38:35,887
Is it is it effective? Is it preventing cases of COVID 19?

319
00:38:36,037 --> 00:38:42,217
We could do a cross-sectional study where we just, you know, survey everybody in Ann Arbor, see, like, did they get the COVID vaccine?

320
00:38:42,847 --> 00:38:46,567
Do they have COVID right now? There would be a prevalence measure that would be a preference ratio.

321
00:38:47,527 --> 00:38:50,856
Or we could do a cohort study where we like kind of follow them over time.

322
00:38:50,857 --> 00:38:55,557
We see a baseline whether they're vaccinated or not. Then over the next year, did they become infected?

323
00:38:55,917 --> 00:38:59,037
That'd be a risk ratio. But it's all the same, like in your dataset.

324
00:38:59,717 --> 00:39:05,807
Um, you know, the. The computer program doesn't know the temporal order of things.

325
00:39:05,827 --> 00:39:12,087
It doesn't know that, like, vaccination happened before your, your disease outcome.

326
00:39:12,627 --> 00:39:21,537
And so that's why these are computed the same way. And it's just a matter of when you measure your when you measure your data.

327
00:39:23,697 --> 00:39:27,537
Okay. So that's relative measures. We also have a family of absolute measures.

328
00:39:28,707 --> 00:39:33,417
And so they these are difference. This is on the additive scale.

329
00:39:33,567 --> 00:39:37,577
So we have risk differences. We have rate differences, odds differences.

330
00:39:37,577 --> 00:39:40,587
It doesn't make sense. I guess you could but try to compute that.

331
00:39:40,587 --> 00:39:45,686
But like it would, it would be meaningless. Um, same issue with risk and prevalence.

332
00:39:45,687 --> 00:39:51,167
It's the same issue. Okay.

333
00:39:51,177 --> 00:39:58,937
So back in the day, like in the eighties and nineties, relative risk was a really common word that you'd find in public logical articles.

334
00:40:01,427 --> 00:40:04,937
Sometimes it meant risk ratio and sometimes it meant odds ratios.

335
00:40:04,947 --> 00:40:12,977
So I would just stay away from this word just because I it seems kind of ambiguous what it actually means.

336
00:40:13,997 --> 00:40:22,097
But, you know, at the very least in your method section, you'd want to mention how you calculate a relative risk.

337
00:40:22,307 --> 00:40:29,626
And I look, I'm not going to penalize you because classic use of the word. I'm just saying, I personally, when people use the word relative risk,

338
00:40:29,627 --> 00:40:36,497
they're oftentimes I'm just not sure what what measure they're actually what measure they're actually using.

339
00:40:38,207 --> 00:40:47,747
Okay. So this is a chart which just kind of explains how you can calculate and interpret different measures.

340
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:50,077
I mean, this is, you know, doing it by hand.

341
00:40:50,087 --> 00:40:57,226
And part of the assignment for this week will be to do something by hand, but then also to replicate it in a homework assignment.

342
00:40:57,227 --> 00:41:01,687
And hopefully you get similar results are replicated using using code in SAS or.

343
00:41:04,487 --> 00:41:10,517
Okay. So. So, I mean, I will have you in your groups kind of try to calculate this out.

344
00:41:10,877 --> 00:41:17,207
But just to give you like a background for how to, how to measure these.

345
00:41:20,807 --> 00:41:30,467
So we have like our two by two table. Always make sure that like the two by two table set is the same way because, you know,

346
00:41:30,677 --> 00:41:36,766
it might be in a different scenario where people will have like a positive exposure versus a native exposure.

347
00:41:36,767 --> 00:41:39,347
Like they might have the rows flip, they might have the columns flipped.

348
00:41:40,967 --> 00:41:51,467
So I try to make things consistent across across assignments and across slides of this class, but like I might not be.

349
00:41:51,467 --> 00:42:00,977
And please let me know if I'm not consistent. But, you know, I just want you to kind of be thinking about what every every cell actually means.

350
00:42:01,427 --> 00:42:06,267
So I'm not going to go through, like, how to actually do all these calculations. I'm sure this is like review from previous classes.

351
00:42:06,707 --> 00:42:10,607
But one thing I want to mention is how to interpret these.

352
00:42:11,627 --> 00:42:19,967
So by positive association, I would need that, you know, the odds ratio is above is above one.

353
00:42:20,897 --> 00:42:27,226
A negative association would be the odds ratio is below one for a difference measure,

354
00:42:27,227 --> 00:42:31,727
you know, positive associations, it's above zero and negative association is it's below zero.

355
00:42:33,197 --> 00:42:44,387
One thing that I found when I'm reviewing how students interpret these things is many of you come from like strong writing backgrounds as undergrads,

356
00:42:44,777 --> 00:42:53,357
and you are used to using like some verbal flourishes and to, you know, not try to be super repetitive in your writing.

357
00:42:53,747 --> 00:42:56,687
I think it's okay for a result section for you to be super.

358
00:42:57,107 --> 00:43:01,727
So I think it's okay to kind of use the same strokes sentence structure over and over and over again.

359
00:43:02,237 --> 00:43:08,657
And the reason why I'm using these and I have kind of set ways is I've noticed in the past,

360
00:43:08,657 --> 00:43:12,767
like students, if they, you know, there's other ways that you can interpret this.

361
00:43:13,067 --> 00:43:18,617
So this is not the only way. And, you know, we will give you credit on homework assignments for interpreting it in a variety of different ways.

362
00:43:18,917 --> 00:43:23,387
But this is to me is just like an easy way. It works across a lot of different settings.

363
00:43:23,777 --> 00:43:29,927
You can totally use these over and over and over again in any manuscript you're trying to publish, and people will understand it.

364
00:43:31,397 --> 00:43:40,186
Okay, so another a few things to keep in mind. So by my measure, I mean, like, is this a risk rate or odds ratio?

365
00:43:40,187 --> 00:43:51,257
So like the odds of having diabetes is 1.5 times higher in the group that drinks coffee compared to the group that doesn't drink coffee.

366
00:43:52,787 --> 00:44:00,497
And I think this is kind of like throughout this this class, we will be using this example of people who are diabetic,

367
00:44:00,497 --> 00:44:06,946
those who are not diabetic in a cohort study and at baseline, those who were coffee drinkers and those who were copy abstainers.

368
00:44:06,947 --> 00:44:11,026
And of course, you know, again, we're making everything dichotomous.

369
00:44:11,027 --> 00:44:17,087
But, you know, I'm sure there's there's more of a continual disorder or more of a normal distribution of coffee drinking.

370
00:44:17,087 --> 00:44:22,817
But we're just going to ignore that for this assignment. Also, just like, you know, all the data this class is made up of.

371
00:44:23,357 --> 00:44:26,747
So please, I like it. I'm not, you know, a diabetes researcher.

372
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:31,816
So don't don't take this as actual factual evidence.

373
00:44:31,817 --> 00:44:35,237
It's just, you know, me using things to prove a point statistically.

374
00:44:36,737 --> 00:44:42,017
Okay. So I think now is about the time to give you about 10 minutes to work on this as a group.

375
00:44:42,647 --> 00:44:48,137
So again, if you go to canvas, you can find the.

376
00:44:50,917 --> 00:45:00,167
You can find this. And you can find your group or just click on one.

377
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:06,167
You have your one of we can kind of skip small group discussion part one.

378
00:45:06,167 --> 00:45:08,206
I mean, if you want to fill in some stuff, that's fine.

379
00:45:08,207 --> 00:45:17,177
But I think we can kind of skip to the part two and I will I will leave this interpretation slide up.

380
00:45:17,657 --> 00:45:22,487
And then, you know, at the end of this, I'll probably go round and have some groups like talk about,

381
00:45:24,587 --> 00:45:32,206
you know, give their response and then also give their interpretation. So yeah, again, I'll give you about 10 minutes to work on this in your groups.

382
00:45:32,207 --> 00:45:35,707
Any questions or I'll leave you to.

383
00:45:47,981 --> 00:45:57,911
And, yeah, let's go through a number of these different calculations for this thing.

384
00:45:58,841 --> 00:46:02,171
And I'm just pulling up my answers.

385
00:46:03,101 --> 00:46:10,851
Okay, so I'm just going to go around. So the proxy through all of the name Y.

386
00:46:11,351 --> 00:46:15,011
So give your your odds ratio. Give the number and your interpretation.

387
00:46:19,971 --> 00:46:26,571
There are times where you said, Yep, I said for one.

388
00:46:30,531 --> 00:46:36,551
The idea that we're going to copy.

389
00:46:40,081 --> 00:46:44,371
Yeah. I mean, one thing I think that you could kind of just take out a redundant word is the word ratio there.

390
00:46:44,401 --> 00:46:53,791
So I think you could just say the odds of diabetes is 0.5, six times as high among those who drink coffee compared to those who do not.

391
00:46:54,991 --> 00:47:00,951
So I don't know if in a previous class you might have learned this.

392
00:47:00,961 --> 00:47:09,721
Also, like if you have an odds ratio of 0.56, you could do like one minus that.

393
00:47:10,081 --> 00:47:20,791
And that would give you, I guess, 44%. So you could also say like the odds are 44% lower.

394
00:47:25,131 --> 00:47:28,581
Does this. See, you might have heard all this and this is fine,

395
00:47:28,791 --> 00:47:34,971
but I think this is like a bit ambiguous when we start continuing to interpret like risk of great differences.

396
00:47:35,271 --> 00:47:39,771
But I think it's a bit like I think this is valid as a way of interpreting it.

397
00:47:40,581 --> 00:47:48,581
I just think it's like a bit in my mind it's been confusing, but you know that that could just be part of it.

398
00:47:48,621 --> 00:47:54,231
Yeah. So that's why I got odds ratios can be five six. Let's go to Tim Pot roast.

399
00:47:54,621 --> 00:48:01,821
Do you have a value for risk ratios? Yeah.

400
00:48:03,841 --> 00:48:06,351
Okay. And do you have an interpretation you'd like to hear?

401
00:48:08,581 --> 00:48:19,741
There's two kinds of stories for those that don't get anything similar in the sense that this one one.

402
00:48:25,351 --> 00:48:34,121
So we have our restriction on the 60. Finally, we have a great ratio.

403
00:48:34,531 --> 00:48:41,490
Could I come here 2 minutes? So what do were you able to calculate regression of?

404
00:48:41,491 --> 00:48:52,711
So. Can you give us your interpretation? So we got a 0.65 would be the ratio of diamonds is 0.6.

405
00:48:54,391 --> 00:48:58,861
Coffee drinkers. Coffee upstairs? Yeah, great.

406
00:48:58,861 --> 00:49:08,041
So I also got .65 again. I think you could just remove ratio and you could just say the rate of this is because like what you could

407
00:49:08,041 --> 00:49:16,021
say is that you could say the rate ratio is 0.65 comparing coffee drinkers to those who don't drink coffee.

408
00:49:16,471 --> 00:49:21,691
But I think in this setup you could just simply say the rate for the measure is just like that word rate.

409
00:49:21,691 --> 00:49:25,291
The rate of diabetes is 0.6, five times as high.

410
00:49:25,561 --> 00:49:34,771
And I would go to the college, says the negative association, and just say 0.65 times as high 0.6, five times higher.

411
00:49:36,181 --> 00:49:45,361
And again, this is sometimes you'll also hear people like if there's a value above one, they'll subtract out one and then say higher.

412
00:49:45,361 --> 00:49:51,941
So like it, it gets a bit confusing. So. Yeah, that's hard to say.

413
00:49:51,951 --> 00:49:57,881
I would say the word as high, but I understand how some people would say. Okay.

414
00:49:58,221 --> 00:50:11,861
Damn. Can we give. Did you do differences yet? We have initiated a series.

415
00:50:13,601 --> 00:50:18,321
In our interpretation, there is a risk of becoming very, very, very.

416
00:50:19,531 --> 00:50:28,601
An opportunity for transparency in Pakistan. Yes, and I think that is totally fine, just saying it like that.

417
00:50:28,621 --> 00:50:34,081
I will say oftentimes when people have a different film, multiply it by 100%.

418
00:50:34,591 --> 00:50:38,341
And so that will just say like -8%.

419
00:50:39,331 --> 00:50:49,141
But again, mathematically, same as what you said. So then you could just say, like the risk of diabetes is 8% lower.

420
00:50:53,681 --> 00:50:58,361
And so that's what we mean here. So the risk of diabetes or this is negative.

421
00:50:58,361 --> 00:51:03,821
So the risk of diabetes is 8% lower among the coffee drinkers compared to those who don't have coverage.

422
00:51:05,561 --> 00:51:10,301
Okay. Yeah, exactly. Yeah.

423
00:51:10,311 --> 00:51:13,271
So person years would be that's for the next one for the rate difference.

424
00:51:13,271 --> 00:51:23,510
So yeah, we'll, we'll go over to that rate now and so the Wagner it's again love the lovely group name can you give me an interpretation.

425
00:51:23,511 --> 00:51:32,980
Were you able to calculate the rate difference. This one is probably the most complicated one, but so happy to help you work through it.

426
00:51:32,981 --> 00:51:41,591
But any values that you have so far. 70 person years were.

427
00:51:46,411 --> 00:51:52,451
Yeah. So very different. So I also had. Yeah.

428
00:51:52,461 --> 00:51:55,991
We think this. It's like you're seven seven something.

429
00:51:56,211 --> 00:52:00,201
Yeah. So for this one.

430
00:52:01,251 --> 00:52:13,641
Similarly to how electricity brings out as well, multiply by 100% per rate difference, oftentimes more multiplied by like person years.

431
00:52:15,891 --> 00:52:22,441
Do something that's interpreted more so because like the 8.0077, it's like a bit complicated.

432
00:52:22,451 --> 00:52:25,481
So, you know, you could do like ten, 100,000.

433
00:52:25,901 --> 00:52:35,951
So if we did 5000 person years, we could say they did 7.7 per 1000 person years.

434
00:52:41,261 --> 00:52:51,130
Which is all to say that, you know, the interpretation for that is the rate of diabetes is negative at that point,

435
00:52:51,131 --> 00:52:58,841
seven per 1000 person years lower in the coffee drinkers compared to the non coffee drinkers.

436
00:53:02,231 --> 00:53:06,401
But like, you know, if you don't want like if you just want to do it by one person, you're it's like mathematically that's equivalent.

437
00:53:07,091 --> 00:53:14,211
Does that make sense, though? And, you know, like there could be conventions.

438
00:53:14,221 --> 00:53:19,811
This is also one of those cultural things. You know, in some fields they just multiply everything by 10,000 person years.

439
00:53:19,811 --> 00:53:24,121
That might be 100,000. It kind of depends on what you're how low your number actually is.

440
00:53:25,891 --> 00:53:29,011
So yeah, so four rate will use things like person years for risk.

441
00:53:29,011 --> 00:53:32,481
We'll just look at we don't know.

442
00:53:32,521 --> 00:53:36,881
We don't need prisoners. Any questions about this?

443
00:53:38,171 --> 00:53:44,811
Okay. Sure I am 30.

444
00:53:50,081 --> 00:54:00,521
So other measures which come from this attributable fractions that I like to talk about, attributable fractions, just because, you know,

445
00:54:00,521 --> 00:54:04,750
we hear about them a lot actually in the news because vaccine effectiveness is an

446
00:54:04,751 --> 00:54:08,971
example of an acceptable fraction where we just go like one minus that risk ratio.

447
00:54:08,981 --> 00:54:12,071
So if we're saying now that, you know,

448
00:54:12,851 --> 00:54:26,491
maybe with a booster like the common vaccine booster is 70% effective against hospitalization, that would mean that it comes from.

449
00:54:26,501 --> 00:54:30,581
So yeah. So vaccine effectiveness is.

450
00:54:33,901 --> 00:54:44,871
70%. Again, I'm just thinking of that number. It either comes from one place or refers to a one minus three or fewer depending on.

451
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:54,981
This would be for a forward savings to be for a police patrol city. And originally that means that those numbers would be 0.3.

452
00:54:55,731 --> 00:55:04,761
So a vaccine effectiveness of 70% means that, you know, the risk of hospitalization is point three times as high.

453
00:55:05,661 --> 00:55:14,831
If those who are vaccinated per those who are not vaccinated. Another number that we see is a number needed to treat or an anti this is often

454
00:55:14,831 --> 00:55:18,131
used in like a clinical setting against Wyndham over the risk difference.

455
00:55:19,511 --> 00:55:25,401
I've heard I've seen this a lot in some kind of like skeptical vaccine, skeptical articles which are,

456
00:55:25,481 --> 00:55:34,211
which are like, Oh, you need to vaccinate 500 kids to prevent one case of disease or something like that.

457
00:55:34,211 --> 00:55:36,701
And that comes from a number needed to treat and see.

458
00:55:36,761 --> 00:55:43,361
Again, I'm not going to go through it, but if it was 500, you could work backwards to see, you know, one divided by what would equal 500.

459
00:55:43,571 --> 00:55:50,421
And that would be what, the risk differences. Okay.

460
00:55:50,421 --> 00:56:02,061
So back to what my takeaway was. How do we decide whether to use odds ratios or not or like some other design or some other measure of association?

461
00:56:03,561 --> 00:56:08,451
So the first question to ask us is basically, do we have a case control study?

462
00:56:09,801 --> 00:56:14,991
And by that, if you're kind of looking at what the scientific definition of a case control study is,

463
00:56:15,411 --> 00:56:22,431
is that means that the probability of selection into the study is different for the cases and the controls.

464
00:56:22,731 --> 00:56:26,211
So does your outcome determine your probability of being selected to the study?

465
00:56:26,721 --> 00:56:32,191
Because in a case, controlled design cases are much more likely to be sampled into the study.

466
00:56:32,241 --> 00:56:35,541
So if you had like a case control study of COVID 19 in Ann Arbor,

467
00:56:35,931 --> 00:56:41,931
cases would be more likely to be sampled to the study that controls the people who were not.

468
00:56:42,261 --> 00:56:48,291
And that's just, you know, efficiency of getting people who have a rare outcome into the study.

469
00:56:49,851 --> 00:56:54,051
So, of course, if you have a case control study, you want to use an odds ratio.

470
00:56:56,261 --> 00:57:00,341
So there's no here to think that like cases and controls are selected separately.

471
00:57:01,331 --> 00:57:11,941
Then you use an authorship. But if you are not selecting people into the study dependent on their their outcome, you can go to the next thing.

472
00:57:11,951 --> 00:57:20,201
So first off, are we collecting stuff longitudinally? If you are, then we could use a risk measure, rate measure.

473
00:57:20,201 --> 00:57:27,490
And I think generally if you have like measures of person years or person months or person weeks or whatever your measure of time is,

474
00:57:27,491 --> 00:57:32,890
I think rate is probably better than risk. But if you do not have that,

475
00:57:32,891 --> 00:57:37,931
then we have a cross-sectional study this that we're using a prevalence measure and we'll talk

476
00:57:37,931 --> 00:57:41,560
in future weeks maybe about like when you use a ratio measure versus a difference measure,

477
00:57:41,561 --> 00:57:46,331
but that's kind of like a personal that's a personal feeling that you have.

478
00:57:46,331 --> 00:57:54,101
Again, the culture of what people in your lab do or people in your field, they might have different traditions.

479
00:57:55,361 --> 00:58:00,491
This is just another way of looking at this. I'm not going to go through this, but this chart might be useful for you.

480
00:58:02,741 --> 00:58:08,441
Okay. So again, some of these are considered absolute measures and some of them are relative measures.

481
00:58:08,441 --> 00:58:11,470
Absolute measures are symmetrical around zero.

482
00:58:11,471 --> 00:58:20,141
So for if you have like a risk difference or a rate difference, zero would be there's no effect, there's no association.

483
00:58:20,501 --> 00:58:24,730
But that could range from, you know, negative infinity to positive 50 or negative one to positive one.

484
00:58:24,731 --> 00:58:28,831
Kind of depends on what your denominator is for a relative.

485
00:58:28,841 --> 00:58:36,731
As there we are symmetrical around one. So that means like have the distance between zero and one is the same as between one and two.

486
00:58:39,401 --> 00:58:46,211
So like a value like odds ratio value of 0.01 is like really strong.

487
00:58:46,211 --> 00:58:51,961
That's a very, very strong value. That's not the same thing as like an of 1.99, which is actually kind of weak.

488
00:58:54,391 --> 00:59:03,511
Okay. So one thing when comparing risk ratios, odds ratios is that odds ratios will always look to be a bit more exaggerated.

489
00:59:03,571 --> 00:59:08,281
And we have this example here where our objectivity, my thoughts, it's very, very restricted.

490
00:59:08,941 --> 00:59:13,171
So the farther we are away from one, the more exaggerated it looks like.

491
00:59:13,741 --> 00:59:19,141
Again, that's not to say that the odds ratio is bias, because it isn't an odds ratio is is its own thing.

492
00:59:20,311 --> 00:59:31,091
But if you were as just like a non-specialist looking at these numbers, four, five, 626 to you'd think, oh, I think this is the strong one.

493
00:59:31,231 --> 00:59:35,491
This is the one which has more meaning. Where is the reality? These numbers are exactly the same.

494
00:59:35,491 --> 00:59:38,641
They like are showing the same strength of association.

495
00:59:40,411 --> 00:59:48,321
So that's all to say that like one of the reasons why maybe I don't like odds ratios so much as they seem to kind of like exaggerate things.

496
00:59:48,331 --> 00:59:51,781
Again, it's not a bias, it's just mathematically what happens.

497
00:59:55,541 --> 01:00:02,131
The other reason that I think we get into this here, but the odds ratios like the term odds is just really confusing.

498
01:00:02,201 --> 01:00:06,761
What is at odds? Pretty much we only hear it being talked about like at the Kentucky Derby.

499
01:00:07,101 --> 01:00:16,661
So, you know, it's just like not a concept which is really, you know, familiar to most people, whereas risk may be so.

500
01:00:18,461 --> 01:00:26,490
And, you know, I've heard this said that, you know, oftentimes in other languages, they might not even have a word for odds.

501
01:00:26,491 --> 01:00:31,691
So they'll just kind of borrow that in. And so I'd be curious if anyone is like a speaker of another language.

502
01:00:32,411 --> 01:00:40,001
But I've heard, you know, Spanish speakers will often say they just will import the word odds directly just because there's not really a good,

503
01:00:40,241 --> 01:00:45,041
coherent term, which is all to say that I think I think odds are this concept is just a bit funky.

504
01:00:47,171 --> 01:00:50,851
Okay. So another reason that we don't like odds ratios has the youth club possibility.

505
01:00:50,861 --> 01:00:58,031
And this again, I will just have you do this as as a group so you might want to split this among ourselves.

506
01:00:58,361 --> 01:01:04,211
Basically calculate the odds ratio, the risk ratio, the risk difference for men, women, for the entire population.

507
01:01:04,511 --> 01:01:09,191
If so, this is just a stratified example. It's the same numbers as before, but I think it's the same numbers as before.

508
01:01:09,431 --> 01:01:15,821
But it's just, you know, that's everybody even split up by men and women.

509
01:01:15,971 --> 01:01:19,300
So I'll give you maybe 6 minutes or so.

510
01:01:19,301 --> 01:01:23,381
And you don't need to worry about interpretations, but just calculate the numbers.

511
01:01:56,481 --> 01:02:07,741
You can actually just think I would walk past. But I think if.

512
01:02:49,951 --> 01:03:26,201
Oh. I know.

513
01:03:26,341 --> 01:03:30,351
And you? I'm not going to regret.

514
01:03:42,791 --> 01:03:51,451
I haven't heard. Five five.

515
01:04:32,441 --> 01:04:36,151
So. Yeah.

516
01:04:39,561 --> 01:04:43,041
Yeah. The.

517
01:04:45,461 --> 01:04:59,861
Sorry. And what you're going to find is.

518
01:05:03,961 --> 01:05:08,521
My card before that. Has everyone signed the sign in sheet?

519
01:05:13,311 --> 01:05:17,861
Right. Me know if I can help you. Okay.

520
01:05:18,201 --> 01:05:25,231
Jeremy, next week. My question. Okay.

521
01:05:26,281 --> 01:05:35,201
Let's let's go through this. Why don't I start with one group, people?

522
01:05:35,581 --> 01:05:41,341
So what do you have for the total value for the ratio with ratio and price difference?

523
01:05:47,931 --> 01:05:58,571
Okay. Yeah.

524
01:05:59,761 --> 01:06:04,931
Hey, I won't quit one longer, but, you know, running with this surviving life.

525
01:06:04,951 --> 01:06:08,041
Do you have anything for memory able to get to that?

526
01:06:13,011 --> 01:06:18,881
Yeah. So for men, what do you have for the odds ratio? Okay.

527
01:06:19,151 --> 01:06:23,181
The risk ratio. Okay.

528
01:06:23,711 --> 01:06:26,711
And there was a difference there. Yes.

529
01:06:28,111 --> 01:06:33,661
And then let me move on to fun. Frequency is what you have for the women's group.

530
01:06:37,221 --> 01:06:42,761
We're able to get through it. For the odds ratio.

531
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:51,331
Yeah. That's a great deal.

532
01:06:53,641 --> 01:06:56,761
Um, for this one. And then for what difference?

533
01:07:04,961 --> 01:07:08,911
So roller coasters 2.00.

534
01:07:10,241 --> 01:07:16,291
All right. Okay.

535
01:07:17,521 --> 01:07:23,970
So this is. These things are what we have. And again, you know, I think to make you tables can be a bit tricky sometimes.

536
01:07:23,971 --> 01:07:30,181
And I'm happy to work through any questions that people have about like interpreting or calculating these things,

537
01:07:30,811 --> 01:07:39,391
but we're just kind of moving forward now. MEAN So I'm sure you've all looked at this, but I want to kind of bring some things to your attention.

538
01:07:40,171 --> 01:07:44,041
So this is the total value and this is what it is for men and for women.

539
01:07:44,701 --> 01:07:49,861
So for risk difference, the total value 0.054 men and 0.05.

540
01:07:50,081 --> 01:07:53,881
So then it kind of just makes sense that for women it's 0.05 rate because like.

541
01:07:56,231 --> 01:08:05,211
That just kind of works mathematically. And I think the risk ratio is an example where the total value is in between what it is for Manhattan.

542
01:08:07,861 --> 01:08:11,671
So I think that kind of makes sense. Like our measures, if we stratify the population,

543
01:08:12,901 --> 01:08:19,361
kind of like the average of that population should be what the total value is or some sort of like number in between.

544
01:08:19,381 --> 01:08:22,531
It kind of depends on how many people each part of the population,

545
01:08:22,541 --> 01:08:30,391
but does that concept really make sense if like the total value should be in between what you get for the stratum specific estimates?

546
01:08:33,531 --> 01:08:42,411
That's an important point for other issue. We do not have that. So for obvious, you are values 1.22 for men is 2.11 for women, 2.11 like.

547
01:08:42,741 --> 01:08:51,221
It doesn't make sense. You know, you think for women that it would like be below 1.2 to 2, kind of like average things out, but that's not the case.

548
01:08:51,291 --> 01:09:06,320
So this is a point where we call the odds ratio is not collapsible, which is, you know, this is like it depends on your to what you table.

549
01:09:06,321 --> 01:09:10,671
Sometimes it'll behave like this, but sometimes they'll just give you like really crazy answers.

550
01:09:15,061 --> 01:09:17,941
I think for Ray Schumer's differences, there can be like really,

551
01:09:17,941 --> 01:09:22,981
really bizarre situations where it wants it'll kind of do something similar to this outsourcing example here.

552
01:09:23,191 --> 01:09:29,191
But the vast majority of the time we can consider the risk ratio and the risk difference or a rate ratio, a rate difference.

553
01:09:29,521 --> 01:09:35,181
We can consider them to be collapsible. So this is just like me verbally writing out.

554
01:09:35,191 --> 01:09:42,060
What does collapse ability mean? Basically means that if we have some third variable here, we have a gender.

555
01:09:42,061 --> 01:09:51,781
But it could be, you know, whatever variable if the measure in the total population is in between the values for the strata specific ones,

556
01:09:52,051 --> 01:09:53,331
then the measure is flexible.

557
01:09:54,031 --> 01:10:02,550
And so for year four risk ratio, you know, it sits in between 1.06 and 2.0 for the risk difference is just that, you know, exactly the same.

558
01:10:02,551 --> 01:10:07,501
So obviously that works, but for odds ratios is entirely different.

559
01:10:08,551 --> 01:10:15,211
So odds ratios are not collapsible. And this is another reason why we don't necessarily like odds ratios,

560
01:10:15,211 --> 01:10:19,110
because some of the methods that we're going to be talking about in future weeks,

561
01:10:19,111 --> 01:10:25,681
like mediation and marginal structural models, they just have an assumption that your measure of association is flexible.

562
01:10:26,731 --> 01:10:33,451
So that's, you know, so the thing to keep in mind is that, you know, for certain causal inference things, we need our values to be collapsible.

563
01:10:33,451 --> 01:10:38,670
And that's just because some bar statisticians and methodologies out there have come up with these beautiful

564
01:10:38,671 --> 01:10:44,971
mathematical formulas and they require things to be collapsible in order for us to make certain assumptions.

565
01:10:45,331 --> 01:10:52,081
It's just like an assumption that undermines some of the causal inference with any any questions on this.

566
01:10:56,511 --> 01:11:04,601
Okay. So for additive measures, so for different measures like risk difference,

567
01:11:04,611 --> 01:11:12,411
weight difference, we can keep those on like a typical axis, like on a normal axis.

568
01:11:12,981 --> 01:11:21,081
But when you use multiplicative measures ratios you should use them upon, you should convert things to a log scale.

569
01:11:22,491 --> 01:11:26,421
So this is an example, you know, the precise example doesn't really matter.

570
01:11:26,781 --> 01:11:34,311
But I was comparing I think I was comparing like vaccination rates between migrants and locals in a certain population.

571
01:11:36,111 --> 01:11:38,961
And these numbers are mathematically equivalent.

572
01:11:39,231 --> 01:11:44,201
This is just, you know, when we consider locals to be the reference group in this is when we consider migrants to be the reference group.

573
01:11:44,721 --> 01:11:51,381
But, you know, the it's it's the same study. It's just like flipping in the SAS or out of what we consider to be the reference group.

574
01:11:54,961 --> 01:12:06,990
So if we graph these, though, if we graph them on a normal axis, it looks like this one is really precise in this one.

575
01:12:06,991 --> 01:12:09,871
It's not like the confidence intervals just look so much smaller here.

576
01:12:10,711 --> 01:12:15,841
But that's just an artifice of us using something that's on a multiplicative scale.

577
01:12:16,231 --> 01:12:20,251
So whenever we have something on a multiplicative scale, if you're trying to display visually and this is, you know,

578
01:12:20,791 --> 01:12:31,201
if you are coming up with figures for a paper or a poster, you know, I love looking at graphical representations of your results.

579
01:12:31,801 --> 01:12:34,321
But yeah, here you shouldn't you should keep things on a log scale.

580
01:12:34,561 --> 01:12:42,691
And in Excel you can click to your format axis options and put things on a logarithmic scale.

581
01:12:42,691 --> 01:12:52,591
It doesn't matter what base you use, any base is fine. Obviously, if you use our SAS, you can also specify what you are, what the scale should be.

582
01:12:56,241 --> 01:13:03,321
Okay. So in the last couple of minutes of class, this leads us to our idea, our big idea of using generalized linear regression models.

583
01:13:05,361 --> 01:13:12,081
And the whole idea here is that in any statistical program that you're using,

584
01:13:12,501 --> 01:13:19,671
there are packages which kind of unify how we can write code for regression models.

585
01:13:20,871 --> 01:13:24,351
And we need to specify two different things a distribution function and a linked function.

586
01:13:24,771 --> 01:13:26,000
You know what these actually mean?

587
01:13:26,001 --> 01:13:31,131
Doesn't really matter too much, but basically a distribution function is like, is your outcome normally distributed or not?

588
01:13:31,791 --> 01:13:39,830
And then a link function is if you have a mean value in a population and a value for a certain observation, how are they linked together?

589
01:13:39,831 --> 01:13:48,021
How do they relate together? I think, you know, looking at specific examples can kind of help you think through what this actually means in practice.

590
01:13:48,381 --> 01:13:53,211
So I'm including code here in SAS, but like for the homework assignments, we be up almost an hour as well.

591
01:13:54,111 --> 01:14:01,821
So basically we can specify GEMA that refers to generalized linear model in SAS.

592
01:14:02,811 --> 01:14:07,311
Of course, you know, you can specify your class variables and then you have your model.

593
01:14:09,861 --> 01:14:15,201
And the difference here is that you have a slash, that you specify your link and your distribution.

594
01:14:15,891 --> 01:14:21,441
So if you wanted to do a linear regression, like if you had a continuous outcome, you could specify the link people's identity.

595
01:14:21,441 --> 01:14:25,431
And that just means the base identity of something. And then you can say there's the normal distribution.

596
01:14:26,151 --> 01:14:31,281
But again, in this class we're not dealing with kind of continuous outcomes, so we're dealing with dichotomous outcomes.

597
01:14:31,281 --> 01:14:39,681
So then you might look at one of these, so you could do a logistic regression.

598
01:14:40,101 --> 01:14:43,551
Then of course, like in SAS, you could just do proc logistic, right?

599
01:14:43,971 --> 01:14:45,411
That, that works just fine.

600
01:14:45,501 --> 01:14:54,201
But Prop logistic is basically a simplification of this of proc gen mod where you specify link to be a logit and the distribution to be binary.

601
01:14:58,381 --> 01:15:05,251
And then for you. So that's if you want an odds ratio, if you want a risk ratio or a prevalence ratio,

602
01:15:05,311 --> 01:15:08,431
you just switch the link from being a load it to link being a lot.

603
01:15:12,221 --> 01:15:19,961
And then if you want a risk or a prevalence difference, you'd specify a link to the identity and distribution to be binary.

604
01:15:22,091 --> 01:15:25,451
So this is all to say that I think in you know, in your in your past classes,

605
01:15:25,451 --> 01:15:30,871
we've talked with you a lot about how you set up regression models, how you put together a linear regression,

606
01:15:30,901 --> 01:15:32,051
some logistic regression,

607
01:15:32,441 --> 01:15:39,501
and making the extra step to do like a risk ratio or a prevalence ratio or risk difference or a prevalence difference is very easy.

608
01:15:39,521 --> 01:15:43,991
It's like the coding is not difficult. It's it's here for you.

609
01:15:45,281 --> 01:15:51,191
The one other thing about this, so it kind of depends on what package you're using in our we're like SAS,

610
01:15:51,611 --> 01:15:59,861
you know, the proc listing is nice because it automatically exponentially aids your your beta coefficients.

611
01:16:02,031 --> 01:16:08,571
So when you have a when you either have a login or a log as a log as the link,

612
01:16:09,051 --> 01:16:15,111
this means that you need to exponentials your beta coefficients so proc logistic automatically does it for you.

613
01:16:15,591 --> 01:16:21,410
For SAS, I think in general it doesn't automatically do it.

614
01:16:21,411 --> 01:16:27,351
You can specify some extra code for it to do, or you could just like paste it into an excel and take the exponent of it there.

615
01:16:27,831 --> 01:16:31,851
But again, that's that's something that will be shown to you in the homework assignment.

616
01:16:31,851 --> 01:16:37,761
But again, maybe another takeaway is that if you have a logistic or a log binomial regression model,

617
01:16:38,091 --> 01:16:45,441
you need to exponential it to get a multiplicative measure of association to odds ratio to your risk ratio.

618
01:16:46,011 --> 01:16:53,601
But for a binomial regression, if you're just if your outcome is different, so that's just output in the in the regression model.

619
01:16:55,371 --> 01:16:59,230
So you don't use marksmanship. Okay.

620
01:16:59,231 --> 01:17:02,050
So this is a study guide for the final exam.

621
01:17:02,051 --> 01:17:11,501
If you are listening to this as an IT make up, then you need a piece this into the end of your work group and kind of answer these briefly,

622
01:17:11,501 --> 01:17:14,380
but if you are here in person, you did not do that.

623
01:17:14,381 --> 01:17:21,101
But these are kind of the content that I would be interested in of having, you know, for their class.

624
01:17:21,761 --> 01:17:24,401
Okay. I'm going to pause Panopto.
