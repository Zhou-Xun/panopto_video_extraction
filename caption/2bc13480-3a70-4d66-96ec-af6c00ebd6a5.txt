1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,230
There is no idea.

2
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:12,710
I think you'll agree with that.

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:55,650
Yeah, well, you know, I don't know anything about the Saudis because I think that I wasn't too much on this type of surface.

4
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:49,360
And I think my secret prefer a letter to my husband and I would say, oh, oh, sorry, I'm sorry.

5
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:57,870
You know, I agree with you because of all the hard thing for me,

6
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:34,770
because if you think of how many student athletes and they want to into any kind of warm up 24 rounds or anything like that,

7
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:41,510
she should know she she started with it.

8
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:58,860
And then I want to feel better if I feel like I have seen this kind of thing.

9
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:07,110
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

10
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:11,680
That. Cause it's not.

11
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:19,300
It's not enough to change.

12
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:31,590
So I think that that's importance to everybody.

13
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:34,649
If I see somebody, please let me pass it on to you.

14
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:45,780
I'm trying to remember your name. And if you want in any way to have your name changed,

15
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:53,360
you want to be referred to by a different name in any way, shape or form, and return it back to me.

16
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:57,659
I will get a new one made. You may feel you are want to hold on to them.

17
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:00,930
You are welcome to return them up here at the end of class and I will hold on to them.

18
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:07,020
I don't care, but I will be trying to use them on a regular basis, at least for like the first month so I can get the names down,

19
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:15,450
as well as taking out a few hours, keeping things just to keep it moving on.

20
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:18,510
First of all, thank you all for doing your musings.

21
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:29,340
I went through all this, these in the first part of this class talking about some of the examples and, you know, just general feedback.

22
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:36,209
This isn't as I think, concerning, but let me always at the beginning of the semester try and calibrate people again.

23
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:44,880
I want you to be connecting the dots. I gave you a very specific crop this time about sort of like talk about communication,

24
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,970
where you saw a mismatch between the communication in its audience.

25
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,380
As we move forward, there won't be so much explicit instructions about what to write about.

26
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,550
But again, please keep giving me examples, concrete things.

27
00:04:58,410 --> 00:04:59,910
Situations where you.

28
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:08,530
War where you see some parallel to what we're reading about or talking about, because that's going to be the meat that drive our class discussion.

29
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:17,260
Your first graded assignment is coming up in I think it's a little over a week.

30
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:22,090
I can't remember exactly when it's due, but it's very much related to today's class.

31
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:29,070
And that gives you what I do is I give you a specific situation very plausible and in fact,

32
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:38,460
ripped from the headlines real world scenario of a public health situation in which we need to be communicating to multiple audiences.

33
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:45,480
And what I want you to do, as you think about communications,

34
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:57,240
is think through what are the characteristics of that audience relevant that you need to be aware of about how it might die.

35
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:04,200
You And by the way, I don't just mean things that would offend them.

36
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:07,620
I mean, a number of you wrote about situations in which communications were.

37
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:13,850
Offensive or distorted based upon someone's race or ethnicity or gender, etc.

38
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:17,960
That is always a problem. That's the easy problem.

39
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:23,810
That's so obvious that we actually don't do a decent job looking out for when we pay attention.

40
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:32,660
I don't realize that in any way, shape or form, but I do want to highlight that many of the problems that come up in communication are

41
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:38,540
more subtle situations in which there's nothing offensive about the communication.

42
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:43,070
It just doesn't work for the audience that it's being delivered to.

43
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:51,020
And if that happens, we can solve that problem through thinking carefully about who are our audiences.

44
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:54,620
And by the way, it's usually plural, not singular.

45
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:03,980
And what are their characteristics and how do those characteristics relate to our goals, our objectives?

46
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:17,870
And so that's what today is going to be about. The other sort of unrelated thing, but different things that I want to bring up some of you.

47
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:28,340
Well, let me put it this way. Some of you already know that I am interested in the use of improv theater as a way of training communication skills.

48
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:40,280
You may have also noticed and you will certainly notice moving forward. I have a purely improvised Improvizational style as an instructor.

49
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:43,790
You're not going to see a lot of slides in this class. What we do is we react.

50
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:53,300
We be present. If you are interested in working this as a skill, I coordinate.

51
00:07:54,350 --> 00:08:02,660
Basically meet ups. Anybody who wants to show up to practice improv games as communication skills training.

52
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:07,470
We do it occasionally, every three weeks or so in person.

53
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:11,870
We're actually downstairs this semester because I didn't get this one.

54
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:19,820
And on Zoom on Friday afternoons, if you're interested, you shoot me an email.

55
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:23,890
I'll put you on the list. You can decide to join or not. This is nothing to do with the course.

56
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:27,530
It's just something that I do and it's related to the topics that we're talking about.

57
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:37,520
But I raise it because we're going to spend a lot of time in this course talking about what it means to be a communicator.

58
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:44,000
Message isn't just the words or the images.

59
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:50,600
It's the whole experience. It's the source. We talked last class about questions of who is giving you that information.

60
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:58,160
And while some of the characteristics of us are immutable, I cannot change certain aspects of me.

61
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:05,700
How I present myself and how you present yourself in different situations is as much part of message design as anything else.

62
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:11,290
And I will be quite honest, I wear a persona when I step into the classroom.

63
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:23,760
I am not always dressed as I am now carrying myself as I am now, etc. in other contexts because I have a role to play here with you in this moment.

64
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:28,320
And I shape how I present myself to accomplish my goals.

65
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:36,330
And I would do it differently when I'm standing in front of a large audience of academic peers that say at a conference.

66
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:45,100
And I would do differently when I'm sitting one on one with somebody. Each of those moments requires a different persona.

67
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:49,900
That's another thing which we will bring in in different ways throughout this course.

68
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:54,460
But if you're interested, feel free to let me know if you're not interested.

69
00:09:54,490 --> 00:10:00,210
No harm, no foul. To kick off today.

70
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:04,350
I want to talk about I went through all the musings and.

71
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:16,510
There are a lot of good examples, but it was interesting to me how many of the examples gravitated towards one particular common area of communication

72
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:25,210
where we saw lots of different types of misalignments between the messages and the communication goal,

73
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:33,040
which is around food and nutrition. I think I've got five or six people wrote down and touched upon this issue.

74
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:36,460
It's an interesting domain and certainly there's plenty of messaging around that.

75
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:42,570
You start to think about what can go wrong in that space just to kick us off.

76
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:52,170
Alexandra, what are you hearing? You were talking about some nutrition related communications in New York City, in North Carolina.

77
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:56,490
What's going on? Somebody else's in New York City. Please share.

78
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,860
Yeah, it's in my meeting.

79
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:07,470
I talked about I worked previously as an interpreter and a health clinic, and I would go into rooms with nutritionists, kind of doing, like, basic.

80
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:12,060
First intake type of visits with Spanish speaking patients.

81
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:18,450
And they would talk a lot about like, what do you eat for breakfast, lunch and dinner when you're mealtimes?

82
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:23,450
And I felt like when they started talking about like, you should be eating three, about three.

83
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:27,210
Well, then seeing as how today is the time, you should be eating your meals.

84
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:34,169
They didn't always, like resonate with the patients because sometimes patients report they would eat like one big meal

85
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:38,730
at two or three in the afternoon and then in the morning and the evening they eat something.

86
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:45,690
And so I felt like the nutritionist were kind of approaching the conversation from this kind of like what here in the United States,

87
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:50,250
we typically think of as like a routine around mealtimes and what should be eating.

88
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:56,580
And that information wasn't always like culturally relevant to the patient who maybe wanted to make changes,

89
00:11:56,580 --> 00:12:02,400
but the changes being suggested were just like just didn't fit with their lifestyle and the way that they approached eating.

90
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:13,950
And a key point I want to raise here is, is the timing of when someone is the most critical piece of the information you were sharing in that moment.

91
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:20,340
No, there are many possible ways to spread out when and how much one is eating

92
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:24,630
over a day that are perfectly reasonable from a from a nutritional standpoint,

93
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:29,910
from an energy management standpoint, etc., which is why we see different patterns in different parts of the world.

94
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:39,030
And yet, if the communication is designed unconsciously with here is the model that we are moving forward.

95
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:44,650
When that misalignment happens, you don't even realize it. You're just presenting this model.

96
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:54,070
And so that's this is an example of the kind of thing which is not that that the idea of what was being shared there was wrong.

97
00:12:54,940 --> 00:13:01,240
It's not even that it was offensive. It was just simply misaligned to the expectations of the behaviors of the audience that you were targeting.

98
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:05,800
That's the kind of stuff that's most pernicious in the context of communication.

99
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:12,340
You don't may not even realize that that misalignment is there, but your audience does.

100
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:18,280
So more examples of this. Let's go.

101
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:22,720
Where next? So you had a similar kind of example.

102
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:29,170
Yeah, very similar. And it's funny because you can't actually see what other people post before you post your own stories.

103
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:38,109
I noticed that, too. I worked at DaVita, the big kidney care company before grad school, and one of my roles was in South Florida,

104
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:48,370
working with a primarily Latinx population and patients who are on dialysis have very restricted diets just because of the nature of their end stage,

105
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:55,000
renal disease and the like. Broad nutrition or diet guidance was, you know,

106
00:13:55,060 --> 00:14:01,060
like increase your protein and decrease things like potassium and phosphorus and things deemed to be bad for them.

107
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:09,550
And beans were one of the like. I mean, we had these like infographics with like pictures of like good foods and bad foods, like, very simple.

108
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:15,100
And beans were a food that were on the like, do not eat these do not approaches in any way list.

109
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:22,330
And we were having diet adherence issues with our population in South Florida, and it took us.

110
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:30,640
Now, it seems really obvious, but it took us time to figure out that the problem was beans are such a staple, affordable,

111
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:43,450
high protein aspect of a lot of South American diets that they blocked out everything else on that infographic when they saw like don't eat beans.

112
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:48,129
And we had resources of like here are some healthy kidney recipes and stuff.

113
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:57,070
And they were I mean, even the pictures on them were like very old white people that you just there was no cultural sensitivity in the messaging.

114
00:14:57,070 --> 00:15:06,910
So they completely ignored all the diet guidance because they didn't feel seen or represented or their culture was acknowledged.

115
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:19,209
My own personal example of this was that I few years ago I was asked to consult with a research center

116
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:28,210
based at Dartmouth that looked at issues of arsenic poisoning and environmental exposures to arsenic.

117
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:32,950
Now, some of that comes through locational issues in terms of wells and things like that.

118
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:37,630
But one of the significant sources of arsenic intake.

119
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:48,590
It's rice. Depending on where you get your prize, rice has a tendency to have arsenic uptake into it.

120
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:53,680
Now, if you eat rice at the quantities that the average American does, it's less of an issue.

121
00:15:54,130 --> 00:16:01,570
But if you are a member of a community that eats rice three times a day, the volume of intake becomes significant.

122
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:10,809
And relative to exactly the same point that somehow the messaging of the original messaging was being designed with this mindset of, Oh,

123
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:13,510
we'll just exclude rice and we'll substitute other grains,

124
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:22,390
like ten of which totally landed flat with anyone who was used to consuming rice literally on multiple times a day.

125
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:33,549
And it took the recognition of, Oh, wait, this pattern of consumption is not aligned with a part of the audience before you can realize,

126
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:36,640
well, okay, so what is the right message for that audience?

127
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:46,940
It's not that there's nothing that can be said there. But it requires acknowledging the different meaning of that risk.

128
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:51,790
The implications of the recommendations. What is the right choice for that person?

129
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:57,910
Maybe radically different than somebody else? Engaging in that question of right from the start of the message design.

130
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:01,840
But again, and this is why I want to keep coming back to the question, what is the goal?

131
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:09,410
The goal is not. Usually never touch a bean or never consume rice.

132
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:18,800
The goal is to understand how do we balance the risks that might come along with that, whether that's to your kidney function,

133
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,470
whether that's to the amount of arsenic one state taking in,

134
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:27,890
etc. and what is valuable to you in terms of your diet, agriculture, what's available to you, etc.?

135
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:35,200
So food is a good example in which there's lots of cultural expectations, lots of different patterns of consumption.

136
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:46,670
But the idea here is the larger one that I want to capture. What is the expectations of different audiences that may play out in many different forms?

137
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:53,200
We're talking now about something like, What am I eating? But it may come also in the form of kinds of words will I use.

138
00:17:54,010 --> 00:18:02,140
It may come in the form of what are the health behaviors that are meaningful to me?

139
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:14,610
We're not. Etc. Just running on the food since I have a lot of examples of where I want to go next.

140
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:22,440
Any you had a similar example with his if I remember correctly.

141
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:31,049
Yeah, I did like an after school program when I was in college and we had our group was like ages five through 13.

142
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:35,550
So a lot of our lessons were really hard to like aim at like teaching anything

143
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:39,540
down to that wide of a range in a way that was meaningful to all of them.

144
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:45,959
But we had one lesson on nutrition that was like really difficult because it tended to focus on the beginning of it,

145
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:50,220
in particular, focus a lot on like very small menu, like nutrients.

146
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:53,220
And we didn't actually talk about like food until we got into later.

147
00:18:53,220 --> 00:19:00,000
So the kids were like not relating to it at all to I know this is the key problem here is not that the kids could not,

148
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:05,370
you know, motivated in this direction. They're not anti the idea of eating healthy.

149
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:09,870
It's that they're going to totally tune out with you're talking about micronutrients

150
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:16,440
where they might not be tuning out if you're talking about French fries. What is the behavior?

151
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:23,310
What is the level of engagement that was relevant for that audience and not a satisfied scale in different contexts?

152
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:27,060
Like what you might want to be communicating with to.

153
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:35,360
A second grader might be the idea of eating fruits and vegetables.

154
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:42,280
What you might want to be communicating to a sixth grader might get a little bit more nuanced.

155
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:49,640
What you might want to be communicating to a. High school student could be quite sophisticated.

156
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:59,870
And at the same time there might be opportunities to get different things depending upon context.

157
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:08,850
So for example, what would I want to be doing if I was doing a nutrition communication to second graders in.

158
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:18,930
New York City. And what I might want to be doing to second graders in a predominantly farming community should be

159
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:26,640
radically different because their lived experience of the food system is fundamentally different,

160
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:33,980
and they may have exposure to things like people in New York City would never have seen.

161
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:39,350
They would have no no knowledge of and vice versa. So.

162
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:45,160
You know. This course is all about memorability. But how do you have things to remember?

163
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:49,900
One key aspect of this is how does this connect with my lived experience?

164
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:54,730
If it's something that I have no connection to, it's going to be hard for that to land on a permanent basis.

165
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:58,270
But if I can connect something to that lived experience,

166
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:05,230
then that becomes much more easy for people to sort of scaffold that knowledge on to what they already know.

167
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:13,370
This is this is one of the broader ideas. I want to try to touch upon this before I lose that.

168
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:21,380
You're talking about the food pyramid, the old one, not the new white plate structure.

169
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:23,149
Talk about a little bit about that,

170
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:33,080
because that's a classic example of a well-intentioned and well shopped message approach that has some real problems in the IT.

171
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:37,709
Yeah, I think similar issues as other people have brought up,

172
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:44,810
but the images of the food itself on the graphics didn't necessarily apply to the diets of students.

173
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:51,380
Like just one graphic across the whole country doesn't apply to all kids who are going to be looking at it.

174
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:59,089
Also thinking about the image of a triangle with the food group split up is a bit too complicated,

175
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:03,800
maybe for a child to be looking at to know how to apply to their own diet.

176
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:08,810
Let's suppose in a second, who is the food pyramid? Everybody familiar with what I'm thinking are talking about the food pyramid.

177
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:18,370
Who is the audience for that? Is it, kids?

178
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:23,170
Is it, parents? Is it?

179
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:29,950
North Country. But let's be really concrete here. Who is that designed to speak to?

180
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:40,510
With it. It seems like they chose to directed towards children because I personally remember seeing it in like my school lunchroom.

181
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:48,040
But I would personally think that it's for the parents who have more control and responsibility.

182
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:54,760
So let's just think about this. Parents are the ones who have control over most of the school lunchroom.

183
00:22:55,210 --> 00:23:00,070
One of the few situations in which the kid themself has direct control over what they're eating,

184
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:02,920
at least to the extent that they have any choice in that context.

185
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:08,590
And we can have a whole nother conversation about the limits of choice in those kinds of cafeteria situations.

186
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:17,110
So in the cafeteria context, what would you want a kid to be doing?

187
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:22,360
Like, what is the purpose of messaging around nutrition in the school cafeteria?

188
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:29,590
This is not and this is not a hard question, like, what do you want the kid to do?

189
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:36,670
You make that choice. That's like like it's like like balancing what kind of food they eat.

190
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:43,750
So eating multiple different things from the available like not only eating the macaroni and cheese

191
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:53,230
and maybe also having an apple or so some kind of balance kind of goal in terms of behavior.

192
00:23:54,760 --> 00:24:00,790
I also want to add that the way that they're usually portrayed in lunchrooms and stuff, it's like a pyramid and it's colorful.

193
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:06,670
So it's like, I guess like more so appealing to children, looking at, you know, trying to make food fun.

194
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:09,760
It's going to make broccoli fun and it's going to be fun because it's on this

195
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,490
pyramid with different colors and now it's going to make you want to eat it.

196
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:20,169
Always make things fun. Well, not what I mean. Like just in a in a in a in a kid brain or like, I'm trying to like, I don't know,

197
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:24,069
just understand the way that the way that those posters are made it.

198
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:29,170
Right. I'm trying to remember, like back in the day, colors, two kids or something that's appealing,

199
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:32,680
seeing like multiple different colors that you see, like different foods that you don't like.

200
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:36,810
But it's like on this grid of colors that are appealing that.

201
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:45,700
So here's just be clear, I'm pushing back here because I want us to use this as an example of a situation where we can dive deeper into.

202
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:50,230
We can look at the surface features and say, okay, colors and kids that might be excited,

203
00:24:50,500 --> 00:25:00,660
but I want us to dive deeper into the alignment between the audience and the goal and the message so colors can have meaning association.

204
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:05,140
What color was meat? You know, I don't know.

205
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:07,240
I don't remember what color fruit was on her.

206
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:15,380
There's no long term memorability associations of whatever the color scheme was of that group of various friends.

207
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:28,040
I would never have done that. I think though, I remember it being like a mechanism with like, oh, like there's all these colors on the food pyramid.

208
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:33,370
You want those colors on your plate, generally like you. Okay. So notice there that's a different message, right?

209
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:37,180
That's not a I want you to match a particular color with a picture of a thing.

210
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:42,280
It's an I want a rainbow and I want your plate to reflect variability of color, etc.

211
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:47,709
Great. Not a problem. But then we have to own the fact that we actually don't care what the colors are.

212
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:51,670
We just want that sort of colorization to be part of the core message.

213
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:58,710
I think like looking in hindsight, I am trying to understand like why they might have done what they what they did.

214
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,930
Not necessarily. Was it as effective as they wanted it to be?

215
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:07,960
Not like. I mean, you can get into whether those like parents are, you know, nutritionally meaningful.

216
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:16,930
Like that's an all the scientific literacy. Yeah, exactly. But the but I think I understand like where they might be going to where like you

217
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:20,230
want to make it look appealing to something that would look appealing to a child.

218
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:24,009
Right. Something colorful. It doesn't need to be, but but it doesn't go into like.

219
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:28,329
Well, is this approach even effective? I think it's just like this is the well, let's see where I'm pushing this.

220
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:32,229
And I want to take this like one more minute and then we'll move on to the next piece of this.

221
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:35,709
But like, okay, it's approachable because it's colorful.

222
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:40,270
I might look at how is that representation of the message?

223
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:46,210
Supporting our objective for that audience in that moment.

224
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:54,080
What do I want their kid to be doing? I want the kid to have an apple and a and milk and something green.

225
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:56,010
If there was a vegetable and something, you know,

226
00:26:56,040 --> 00:27:01,690
whatever the main course is and to consume all of it or something like that, representing diversity of foods.

227
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:07,570
Is the pyramid aligning to that behavioral goal?

228
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:14,919
Not pretty well. And this is this is why I challenge the question of like there's a lot of things that look okay on the surface.

229
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:19,389
You're going to hear this over and over and over from me. There are a lot of messages that look okay.

230
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:21,760
On the surface, it's a little not our head.

231
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:27,160
And then if you really dive deep, you go, wait, I'm actually not doing what I want it to do in this moment.

232
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:34,000
So we're going to be pretty critical in this class about messages because there's a lot of things out there that I look at and go,

233
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:40,209
It's fine, but it's not memorable, it's not sticky, and it's not likely to actually align with the audience.

234
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:43,930
Member Yeah, I don't mean to harp on the color thing.

235
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:47,380
Yeah. As far as the focus of the purpose of the colors,

236
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:56,620
maybe the focus of the colors doesn't need to be to convey that all blue is red area orange and you should want these colors.

237
00:27:57,190 --> 00:28:04,930
Maybe it could just be look, colors like that could also just be the purpose of it because we want kids engaged with this material.

238
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:11,709
If you have a pyramid that's black and white, most kids, teenagers or whatever are not even going to take a look at that.

239
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:16,720
So if we're thinking in terms of like ads and colors and things, that type of thing, that's what we want.

240
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:22,530
I know that perspective. I will hope.

241
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:28,780
By the end of this course, you will second guess that question.

242
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:34,180
I believe that black and white things can absolutely be pulling somebody in and that there are plenty

243
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:39,130
of situations in which all kinds of flashy colors I will look at for 2 seconds and ignore what I kid.

244
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,490
Yes. You don't have to believe me.

245
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:50,590
This is why I'm putting forward a fairly specific agenda in this course, an approach to thinking about message design.

246
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:59,020
You can be critical of that approach. I want you to be critical of that approach. Question What the purpose is of different kinds of design.

247
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:03,460
But to me, the question is not is it colorful or not?

248
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:13,840
It is the kid going to see a clear message? Is the kid going to see something that is concrete and represents what they should be doing or not doing?

249
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:20,079
I think it really well we'll dive into this in much greater detail.

250
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:26,020
But this is part of my purpose for today is to highlight not just look at something and say is that,

251
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:29,920
well, visually appealing because there's lots of stuff that's visually appealing.

252
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:34,630
You will not pay any attention to it. For the deeper question of what do you want?

253
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:39,280
What's your goal in that moment? What do you want that kid to be doing in that moment?

254
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:46,960
And if we go back to the future of it, if it's the primary audience for most food decisions,

255
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:51,729
is parents or those who are doing shopping and cooking in the household,

256
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:59,940
whoever that may be, then to look at that and say, well, okay, is that message well aligned there?

257
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:06,819
What are the problems with that message? We've already talked about some in terms of cultural expectations and then food consumption patterns,

258
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:13,590
but there are many other things that come into that question as well. I need to keep us moving on because there's other things I got to do today.

259
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:17,650
We could dive down this path a long way, right?

260
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:21,460
Question But keep asking. Yeah.

261
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:24,570
So my thought was something aside from colors. Yeah,

262
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:30,399
I kind of keep thinking about the food pyramid and things like that in terms of the same way we did the

263
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:36,610
water quality report where almost was like maybe a sense of accountability for the cafeteria as well.

264
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:40,630
It's like maybe like kids have a visual, they see what's on there.

265
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:44,790
Like when they go through the line, it's like, is it lining up?

266
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:48,760
Are they being held accountable for what they're actually providing? Fair enough.

267
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:58,500
Then the right question to ask is, in that design of a message, the optimal way to create that kind of accountability.

268
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:04,320
Who had other way for the other messages. Push that idea further.

269
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:08,440
Make it easier for somebody to hold the captain accountable for the balance of the day.

270
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:12,340
Things like that. I know you've been even itching.

271
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:16,030
What do you want to say? Well, I guess like the philosopher, the thought of that.

272
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:20,560
Is there even any point in trying to convince a child to eat broccoli if they're on hold?

273
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:26,500
No. No, like if they're at home and like their parent, just hypothetically at home, a parent is trying to feed them broccoli.

274
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:29,350
Now you come to school and you show them all these flashy colors.

275
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:33,200
Is this the place where they're all of a sudden going to want to eat broccoli just because there's a color?

276
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:41,020
So at the end of the day, is there even a point in like, again, what you said, is this the optimal way to get this message across?

277
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:48,040
If you're trying to think about this, if what you wanted to do. Was to say, I'm going to have broccoli.

278
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:50,200
Actually, I'll move it past broccoli.

279
00:31:51,070 --> 00:32:00,460
I'll give you a concrete example of where the table initiative is initiated to bring local produce into school lunchrooms.

280
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:09,590
Many of the dishes that might be prepared may be unfamiliar to the kids who might be then consuming them.

281
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:18,330
What would you want to do from a message design standpoint to align to see that an audience is school age kids?

282
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:28,770
Your purpose is to encourage them to try these unfamiliar vegetables, fruits, whatever that might be now available as part of the program.

283
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:36,590
Now think about what would you want that message to do, how it would look, etc. because you have a very concrete goal.

284
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:43,110
Bringing this stuff in. We want them to try it. That's our behavior.

285
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:45,280
How do we message in a way to support that?

286
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:54,669
Now, because of the specificity of our audience and our goal, we can get into questions of, do I show you this broccoli?

287
00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:59,380
Do I put it in different formats? Is there other things that we could do that might make somebody want to try it or not?

288
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:04,300
But it's not about, Hey, let's make broccoli fun. It's about a very specific behavioral goal in that moment.

289
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:08,330
And we can have lots of discussions about how we would do that.

290
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:14,390
But notice the format of the conversation here becomes not let's make kids like broccoli,

291
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:23,840
because let's message around this specific moment in time with a specific audience in mind to get a specific behavior occurring.

292
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:34,710
And that message may be very different than the message you would give to that same audience about a different thing,

293
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:41,780
a different audience about the same thing, etc. That's the level of thinking.

294
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:50,330
I want us to start to be really concrete about who the audience is, what the moment it's what our goal is.

295
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:56,659
All right. Moving off food just because there are plenty of other examples.

296
00:33:56,660 --> 00:34:02,180
You and I don't want to completely ignore them. Uh oh.

297
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:06,740
I'm sorry. You were talking about a.

298
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:14,630
Genetic counselor I think you've seen who spends a excessively long time before actually getting the test results.

299
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:21,200
Yeah. So this wasn't something that I saw that I had shared with me in a research interview that there are

300
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:30,270
geneticists who disclose genetic testing results by first going through every aspect of before they got there.

301
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:34,069
So talking about are you on birth control? This is why we decided to do testing.

302
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:39,920
This is the testing that you had like having a half hour conversation before disclosing these results,

303
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:45,450
while the patients like squirming in a chair because they know that for their results and they just want to know.

304
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:50,330
So notice, why is this person doing this? It's not that they're not coming from nowhere.

305
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:58,790
Like, let's make sure all of that foundational background knowledge which may be relevant to interpreting what the results are, is on the table.

306
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:03,350
And not like we can come up with a rational reason why somebody might design a communication that way.

307
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:08,870
What's the problem? It's completely ignoring the emotional state of the person in that situation.

308
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:13,370
They are not in a state to sit through all of that background.

309
00:35:13,370 --> 00:35:15,590
They need to know what their result is because that's why they're there.

310
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:25,460
That same content delivered at a different moment in time might be fine, but that's not the moment.

311
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:32,689
So it's not that it's wrong. It's not that they don't even know the person you're talking to.

312
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:35,150
It's that it's not well aligned to that moment.

313
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:46,220
By the way, another example of that one, which I talk about a lot when I work with doctors, is things like it's one of the hardest moments.

314
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:53,900
If you think about this audience and goal is conversations at a moment when somebody has just been diagnosed with something.

315
00:35:56,570 --> 00:36:00,650
Somebody I work with. Put it this way. Like as soon as a patient hears the word cancer,

316
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:05,719
every other thing that you are going to say for the rest of that meeting will go in one ear and out the other.

317
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:12,420
And it does not matter because all they are hearing is cancer. Okay.

318
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:17,910
It's not that the material is wrong. It's that the moment is wrong.

319
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:26,320
And so if you need them to be engaging, somehow, you have to allow that initial emotional experience of,

320
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,860
Hey, I've just been diagnosed with cancer to run its course before.

321
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:32,890
You're able to engage with the question of, Well, okay, what are we going to do about that?

322
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:40,030
What are our treatment choices, etc.? Let's see more examples.

323
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:49,980
So there. Actress.

324
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:54,570
Not. Not you, Katherine or Katherine. You Katherine Heigl.

325
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:59,969
Damn, Katie, I have to make Katherine's in Annie's, and there's a few names that are repeated in this room,

326
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:03,930
so I'm going to try and navigate, but apologies if I had to call on the wrong person.

327
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:08,520
You were talking about pap smears. Yeah.

328
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:15,230
So let's talk about that one. Sure. Yeah. So I was working in a clinic.

329
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:22,350
I'm a student also, and I was working in a clinic last summer, and it's like an adolescent clinic.

330
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:26,309
So the patient population is like very young in Ypsilanti.

331
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:32,430
So this patient was like didn't complete high school, like global health literacy level.

332
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:35,459
And it was like her first time giving a pap smear.

333
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:46,710
And the doctor used a lot of jargon, but the patient was clearly not understanding, like, like neoplasia and like cytology,

334
00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:55,350
like very like medical words and like, yeah, it just wasn't explained like super clearly.

335
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:59,640
And the procedure itself, like, what was going to happen was also not explained like very clearly.

336
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:04,139
So I feel like that was like a detriment to the patient's experience.

337
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:12,660
And the doctor was very well intentioned and I think was just trying to do their best, like being as accurate as possible.

338
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:24,280
But it just like didn't match the audience. And we think of an audience for which the way it was originally presented would have been right.

339
00:38:24,890 --> 00:38:29,860
Like teaching my students. Right. So it's not that the content is wrong.

340
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,910
Like, if you want to teach med students about neoplasms, then fine.

341
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:46,390
That language is necessary in that context. If you're talking to patients, it's not what, it's issues of cancer.

342
00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:51,070
Maybe it's just even a test. It's a screening test. Maybe it's about just simply the behavioral component.

343
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:55,120
When does this need to be done? What can be learned? What can not be learned from it, etc.?

344
00:38:55,540 --> 00:39:01,650
Like a lot. What does the audience need? The audience is no need to know the term neoplasm.

345
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:07,990
You know, this has great need to know. What do I need to do?

346
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:13,360
What should I feel from what you are telling me about this test, etc.?

347
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:26,100
Um. So. So what do you think about us doing this deep dive on mission critical information?

348
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:32,630
Are you getting enough early on the design of the, you know, this crowd content that we've been talking about?

349
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:38,780
What did I just do? I dropped into business jargon.

350
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:47,410
Totally wrong for this content. If I was talking to Ross, maybe not wrong.

351
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:55,400
And those terms are accurate. But they don't align with the purpose of the moment.

352
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:04,290
And. COVID is my last hope on this one is.

353
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:16,500
Think about how much of public health or medical communication that you're familiar with, you worry about is it complete?

354
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:25,730
Did you say everything? Completeness.

355
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:28,910
We're going to talk a lot about in this class.

356
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:38,240
And one of the more provocative things I'm going to say is I fundamentally believe that good health communication is rarely complete,

357
00:40:40,970 --> 00:40:43,550
and completeness is the enemy of memorability,

358
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:51,530
because it forces us to go down the pathway of using terms that are relevant to us but may not be relevant to our audience.

359
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:59,870
It forces us to go down the pathway of not caring whether that information is relevant to that moment and only caring whether it's right.

360
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:14,470
The patient who's getting a pap smear is not actually needing everything about pap smears to be successful in that moment.

361
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:23,549
The person who is choosing what they're going to eat at the cafeteria does not necessarily need to know about micronutrients,

362
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:26,730
even if that is salient for what the behavior is you want them to do.

363
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:35,370
What are we trying to do with one audience? In one moment, at least one message.

364
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:45,190
Questions and feel free to push back on.

365
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:50,340
Part of the tension of health communication design is.

366
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:59,780
There is a there is a legitimate tension between what we are trying to accomplish and what we can do in any given moment.

367
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:04,640
I mean, you know my perspective on this, but why bother with messaging at all?

368
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:10,880
Because we know choice architecture works and we can just get people to make the right decision without even having them ask the question of why.

369
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:21,230
Short three Paternalistic one choice architecture doesn't always work, and in some circumstances,

370
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:25,850
again, in many ways, the same conversation to had about things like church architecture.

371
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:31,190
Well, designing a moment isn't about just messaging, it's about the physical environment.

372
00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:36,680
But it's also specific to who is the audience, what is the moment, and what is the purpose.

373
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:40,790
We have to be at that kind of specificity to do good.

374
00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:49,610
So incentive design, just as much as it is, you have to have that kind of clarity of context in order to do message.

375
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:56,509
Good message. But the other argument I'll make here is that there are some times in which we

376
00:42:56,510 --> 00:43:01,070
want behavior to exist regardless of whether or not somebody has cognition.

377
00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:09,200
And there are other times in which we cannot know what the right behavior is, and hence we have to engage with cognition.

378
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:14,900
We have to engage with emotion. We have to help people make the decision on their own about what to do.

379
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:21,750
And that's going to require being aware of what that situation is.

380
00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:25,670
So if I go back to my arsenic consumption example,

381
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:32,480
I'm not going to make this family who has been consuming rice two or three times a week immediately start consuming rice.

382
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:43,149
That is not on the table. I am hopefully going to want to help them think through how much consumption there

383
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:47,890
is and to think through what is the appropriate balance to make in that situation.

384
00:43:48,970 --> 00:43:53,170
As you those of you have told me before, we know this and know that if you are seeing me now,

385
00:43:53,290 --> 00:43:55,900
I go off on tangents from time to time, you're going to get used to it.

386
00:43:57,010 --> 00:44:02,710
My personal salient example of this right now is, as you guys well know, I like dark chocolate.

387
00:44:04,030 --> 00:44:09,760
Anybody seen the recent news about dark chocolate and lead and cadmium?

388
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:21,309
There's a significant potential for particularly dark chocolate to have levels of heavy metals which are more higher that are higher

389
00:44:21,310 --> 00:44:26,799
than we would like in the whole Consumer Reports article about this has gotten a lot of press coverage in the last couple of weeks,

390
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:36,370
etc. When the press coverage came out, one of the images on the article was a picture of a Trader Joe's chocolate bar,

391
00:44:36,370 --> 00:44:42,699
of which I had two sitting on my desk at that moment. Am I going to consume it?

392
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:47,470
Yes, I'm going to consume. Do I want to think about.

393
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:53,760
How much of it am I going to consume in a sitting? Do I want to think about do I want to buy more of that as well?

394
00:44:54,100 --> 00:45:02,280
Like, what are the behaviors that message should create in me in that I am the audience?

395
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:13,560
For that communication. I literally had this bar which apparently has higher levels of cadmium than we would like.

396
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:18,900
Twice as much on my desk. What am I supposed to do about that?

397
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:25,450
Because the answer of freak out and then. You know, be overwhelmed is not relevant.

398
00:45:34,670 --> 00:45:41,910
So let me quickly go through one or two more. Is there one?

399
00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:52,820
Oh, I wanted to make sure to touch that one. Actually two more.

400
00:45:56,270 --> 00:46:00,920
Marissa. I will orient.

401
00:46:01,070 --> 00:46:08,630
I promise. Tobacco brochures and the different situations in which they were being evaluated.

402
00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:11,600
It's a really interesting story. I want to share it with the rest of them.

403
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:18,800
Yeah, I was working in tobacco control policy stuff before I returned to grad school.

404
00:46:19,190 --> 00:46:25,700
And part of what we did was made for sure is because as much as the policy matters, so does getting communicated.

405
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:31,970
And before disseminating to key partners, we evaluate it and have surveys.

406
00:46:32,810 --> 00:46:38,450
And so we send them out to or we gave them to different settings.

407
00:46:38,450 --> 00:46:48,899
And so a lot of them were like in clinics and then community centers and we got back all the surveys and they were known.

408
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:51,470
And so we knew where they came from and when they were taken.

409
00:46:52,190 --> 00:46:57,050
And most of them were like pretty average and positive and like, yes, this is helpful information.

410
00:46:57,320 --> 00:47:04,280
And the information was broadly there are higher rates of tobacco consumption in the community

411
00:47:04,430 --> 00:47:10,160
and there's a history of big tobacco targeting and for resources if you want to help quitting.

412
00:47:11,450 --> 00:47:19,490
And then we got back like a handful that were just like, this is terrible, this is paternalistic, this isn't relevant to the community.

413
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:24,920
Why does this matter when people are dying and there are all of these other bigger concerns?

414
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:29,480
I'm like, well, maybe there's something wrong with.

415
00:47:30,610 --> 00:47:33,489
The messaging for a specific group of people.

416
00:47:33,490 --> 00:47:41,770
So we went through and we looked at demographics and ages and none of that really came back with any meaningful difference.

417
00:47:42,550 --> 00:47:46,900
And then we just thought, Okay, well, when did these people take the survey?

418
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:56,530
I was at a leadership training where the entire day was centered around how to get into institutions of power and get your voice heard.

419
00:47:56,530 --> 00:48:01,800
And it was this event where people were thinking about what are the problems in the system?

420
00:48:01,810 --> 00:48:09,670
How can we fix them? And so then one handed approach that was like we are helpless to big tobacco and look at what they did to the community.

421
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:15,820
The response was, That's not the problem. We have all of these other issues.

422
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:17,410
Let's focus on this instead.

423
00:48:17,530 --> 00:48:25,750
But then the ones that were in a health care center with either like someone who's known the community for getting advice or from a doctor,

424
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:27,790
they're like, Yeah, this makes sense. Thanks for telling me.

425
00:48:28,210 --> 00:48:33,790
So the thing that I take away from your example here is it's not so much different people.

426
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:37,630
You have settings, moments, context,

427
00:48:37,870 --> 00:48:45,250
which raised awareness of perspectives about the materials that you were testing in one context and brought up very different issues and another one.

428
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:53,250
Now the question is, what do you take away from that? Is that the fact that you got that negative feedback mean that it's wrong everywhere?

429
00:48:53,820 --> 00:48:59,550
Or does it mean that you want to think about the alignment of where this message might be used?

430
00:48:59,820 --> 00:49:04,559
What kinds of context would be used? What kinds of populations, etc.? How?

431
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:14,370
The reason I wanted you to share this is. We often think of audience in terms of these characteristics demographics, age, gender, ethnicity, etc.

432
00:49:15,690 --> 00:49:21,630
You're talking about context that is more about location, identity,

433
00:49:21,930 --> 00:49:28,180
professional identity, or or personal identity and whether those are salient or not.

434
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:37,140
But that's just as much a characteristic of the audience as anything else, is that you want to message me around hand-washing.

435
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:46,950
My reactivity to a message around handwashing is going to be very different in this building.

436
00:49:48,670 --> 00:49:57,130
Then I will be, say, at a restaurant, because in this building, I'm a public health professor and I very well look like.

437
00:50:00,310 --> 00:50:08,230
But elsewhere I'm just a person and so I am reactive to what do I need to be showing?

438
00:50:08,230 --> 00:50:09,160
What do I need to be doing?

439
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:16,840
How do I need to be manifesting my identity as a public health professor in this space in a different way than I might be, in other words.

440
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:24,770
Another component of audience. Again, think. Don't just think about the person.

441
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:28,790
Think about the context. Think about the moment. Because that's another key piece of it.

442
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:31,640
All right. One other example I just want to briefly touch upon.

443
00:50:33,770 --> 00:50:40,550
Like you're talking about the analogy of of days instruction and when that didn't quite work well.

444
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:47,719
Yeah. So for context, I'm a genetic counseling student and I had a clinical vacation over the summer in pediatrics

445
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:52,610
at the hospital I was at sees a lot expanded or a large amount of Spanish speaking patients.

446
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:58,940
And one of the goals of a lot of genetic counseling sessions is to explain the fact test before you provide it as an option to the patient.

447
00:50:59,630 --> 00:51:04,760
And so the most of the patients at this hospital are of European descent.

448
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:09,200
And so a lot of analogies are one analogy is often used as saying that DNA is like an

449
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:13,970
instruction booklet for your body and gives instructions for how to make and do what it does.

450
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:20,930
But whenever I survivors are explained to me, whenever they use this analogy with their patients of a Spanish speaking population,

451
00:51:20,930 --> 00:51:23,660
specifically this population as largely from Mexico.

452
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:29,150
The analogy didn't really land because culturally that analogy, which is not something that they grew up with or they were familiar with.

453
00:51:29,690 --> 00:51:32,540
And so she explained to me that when I was working with those patients,

454
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:37,280
she has to alter her communication from experience of having it not really worked very well in the past.

455
00:51:38,870 --> 00:51:42,560
Again, nothing wrong with it. It's not wrong in the absolute sense.

456
00:51:43,010 --> 00:51:47,510
That analogy works well for some population. It's not working well for that particular population.

457
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:52,910
Awareness of that allows you to then adjust the conversation in ways that might be more effective.

458
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:57,350
But both that's a question of testing and the question of awareness.

459
00:51:57,350 --> 00:52:03,049
Like to the extent that you now have heard that if you ever wanted to use that analogy, you might remember, Hey, wait a second.

460
00:52:03,050 --> 00:52:07,850
Not everybody thinks about DNA as an instruction manual that may not land with everybody.

461
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:14,720
It might not make them think about what other alternatives might be. These are all examples of the kind of thing that I want us to be thinking about.

462
00:52:15,230 --> 00:52:20,840
So I want to take a few minutes now and do it a few sort of off the cuff examples together as a class.

463
00:52:21,830 --> 00:52:25,190
These are similar to the kind of thing I'm going to ask you to do in that first assignment.

464
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:33,200
So for each of these kinds of things I'm going to bring up, I want us to think about.

465
00:52:44,970 --> 00:52:53,190
What is salient audience characteristics? And again, this could be things about the person or it could be things about the moment or the context, etc.

466
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:58,710
Video Content. What is the context in which the communication might actually be different?

467
00:52:58,730 --> 00:53:00,390
What's the moment? The situation?

468
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:13,400
Something we've spoken to a little bit of talk about much more directly in each of the examples I'm going to bring up.

469
00:53:13,410 --> 00:53:17,010
Why would they care? How is this relevant to the.

470
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:29,440
What's our goal? To communicate the new situation and to get specific or not?

471
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:33,310
I want to inform people about X, but like what do we want them to think or feel or do?

472
00:53:38,190 --> 00:53:42,390
And then what might be some barriers to having those things occur.

473
00:53:43,710 --> 00:53:53,420
So here's an example. Let's imagine that you are going to ask me.

474
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:59,389
You are involved in public health research and you are going to a meeting with your community

475
00:53:59,390 --> 00:54:09,620
partners about sharing with them outcomes that you have observed in your asthma education initiative.

476
00:54:10,430 --> 00:54:14,120
So this is involved with this has an education initiative in this community.

477
00:54:14,150 --> 00:54:22,070
You are not going back to that community meeting with your community partners to share with them the outputs of your research.

478
00:54:23,370 --> 00:54:30,330
Very standard kind of situation. What is characteristics?

479
00:54:30,570 --> 00:54:34,700
What are salient audience characteristics in this context? Yeah.

480
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:42,070
High level education. Maybe. I mean, who would be at this community meeting is the first question you need to be asking.

481
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:48,430
Are these highly educated people, are these community leaders who may or may not have particular high education?

482
00:54:48,430 --> 00:54:54,670
But fair question, like, is this, you know, somebody who runs a school there?

483
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:58,790
Is this a pastor? Is this something.

484
00:54:59,230 --> 00:55:03,670
Who are these people? What else? What are other characteristics that are salient about that?

485
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:12,380
I think maybe they're passionate. They're showing up to learn about this. So a first year engaged.

486
00:55:12,390 --> 00:55:19,460
Well, and presumably, if these are your partners, they have already some prior engagement with this topic in this process.

487
00:55:19,550 --> 00:55:23,000
Project like this is not a cold call moment.

488
00:55:23,230 --> 00:55:26,900
Like, these are people who already know that the project exists,

489
00:55:27,410 --> 00:55:32,000
have some degree of caring about asthma, and are interested in finding out what happened.

490
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:38,660
That's really powerful. Like, for example, you wouldn't need to go through a lot of background information about asthma.

491
00:55:38,750 --> 00:55:42,170
You could presume that they already have some knowledge about it and motivation.

492
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:54,620
What else? I feel like never.

493
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:02,640
And. I feel like you have to know,

494
00:56:02,820 --> 00:56:09,780
understand your role in the community so that you can give them findings that pertain to something that would be useful to them actually.

495
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:11,249
So like an educator,

496
00:56:11,250 --> 00:56:17,909
like some of that would be useful for students or if they're good fitness instructor how do you like this is getting into this question here,

497
00:56:17,910 --> 00:56:21,720
but why do they care? They don't care about this in terms of publications.

498
00:56:22,590 --> 00:56:30,990
They probably do care a great deal about, hey, is there something we ought to do to change either how we're treating people with asthma,

499
00:56:31,110 --> 00:56:36,210
change our environment in a way that might reduce our risk. Like what's the relevance to our situation?

500
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:42,210
Yeah, I would think like what is their degree of influence?

501
00:56:42,450 --> 00:56:51,189
Good community. And related to that might be the question of is this a message in which you imagine really

502
00:56:51,190 --> 00:56:56,010
them only thinking about the influence on themselves like their own individual behavior?

503
00:56:56,020 --> 00:57:00,400
Or is this a population which might be able to exert influence at a policy level,

504
00:57:00,970 --> 00:57:04,780
at a school level or community level, and make more systemic changes?

505
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:08,530
And our goals might be fundamentally different if it's that kind of population.

506
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:13,200
Good. Any other thoughts on characteristics?

507
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:16,890
We haven't talked here about age.

508
00:57:17,610 --> 00:57:21,750
I'm presuming these people are not like second graders, but.

509
00:57:22,830 --> 00:57:26,910
Depending upon the crime. If we were going to a school, we might have school kids, a part of the audience.

510
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:31,770
We need to think about that. Yeah. I mean, I it's like how they're affected by asthma.

511
00:57:31,770 --> 00:57:35,760
So are they parents or the grandparents? Good. Are they patients?

512
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:42,600
Yeah, they have it. They have friends and family members. Or is this an abstract topic about sort of like another health issue in their community?

513
00:57:42,990 --> 00:57:49,650
I'd speak really differently if I knew that most of the people in the room had personal, direct experience with asthma.

514
00:57:50,890 --> 00:57:54,480
And reflect that in the way in which I was talking about. Right.

515
00:57:55,800 --> 00:58:02,940
Yeah. Think about what it's like racially and ethnically homogenous or whether people from a lot of backgrounds.

516
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:11,700
Hey, how will that shape this conversation if they are more homogenous versus very likely to be careful

517
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:16,470
about using certain items or talking about things in ways that are not culturally sensitive?

518
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:23,640
And notice the key question here is. To what degree is any kind of demographic characters?

519
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:28,410
And we can talk here about racial ethnicity. We could talk about income, it could have other characteristics.

520
00:58:29,070 --> 00:58:34,110
Is this related to the topic at hand? So, for example,

521
00:58:34,890 --> 00:58:42,210
one thing that might be highly selective and often is stealing when we're talking about this type of communication is where is somebody living?

522
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:49,500
Since environment is such a key risk factor in air pollution and or other kind

523
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:55,170
of environmental exposures that may be correlated tightly with income issues,

524
00:58:55,560 --> 00:59:02,040
racial segregation of the community, etc. Awareness of that context is really important.

525
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:15,190
So here's another here's an example of this. I worked on a project related to dioxin exposure in Cleveland, which is a couple hours north of here.

526
00:59:16,750 --> 00:59:20,740
The people who were most exposed were those who have riverfront property,

527
00:59:21,730 --> 00:59:27,980
and the stuff was dumped into the river, Falls River kind of property, rich people.

528
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:34,930
In fact, in that particular community, the most exposed population was the rich people who owned the riverfront properties.

529
00:59:35,140 --> 00:59:42,190
And if you had to know that too, then think about how that dynamic was going to play out in terms of the population that you were talking to.

530
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:48,250
Context. Where was this happening? Physically.

531
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:56,930
It's not here. Here. So I've set this up and we're doing a community meeting in that community.

532
00:59:58,580 --> 01:00:02,180
So that context is important.

533
01:00:05,530 --> 01:00:09,579
It might shape what I how I present myself. It might shape how much I am branding it.

534
01:00:09,580 --> 01:00:15,360
As a University of Michigan thing, for example, it might shape what other connections we're building with it.

535
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:21,080
What's my goal? What am I trying to accomplish in that moment?

536
01:00:28,130 --> 01:00:32,140
Well, let me put it this way. How would you contrast what I'm trying to do in that moment,

537
01:00:32,150 --> 01:00:37,160
in that community meeting versus what I'm trying to do about the same project at professional conference?

538
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:44,150
A professional conference. I want to prove that we did good science.

539
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:48,320
I wanted to potentially get this thing published or talked about or cited.

540
01:00:48,950 --> 01:00:53,480
None of those things are necessarily driving me in that moment, like in the past.

541
01:00:53,870 --> 01:00:59,330
Yeah, it's probably more about like maintaining a good relationship with the community or building trust.

542
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:03,290
So trust is key. Did you do what you said you were?

543
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:07,940
Did this project unfold appropriately? If a continual relationship is important?

544
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:13,100
But they've invested their time in this project in us.

545
01:01:13,550 --> 01:01:18,710
We are returning that. I may feel a sense of obligation to make sure that they see what was accomplished.

546
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:23,030
But that's a very different thing than saying, look at our statistical significance here.

547
01:01:26,030 --> 01:01:30,330
All right. Here's another quick example. Uh.

548
01:01:32,990 --> 01:01:40,010
Which one do I want to do? You're designing a safety instruction booklet for laboratory workers in a hospital.

549
01:01:42,940 --> 01:01:47,140
Are the labs and hospitals. Lab.

550
01:01:47,150 --> 01:01:50,940
Safety is an important thing we will be communicating about. Okay.

551
01:01:52,190 --> 01:01:58,450
Audience characteristics. Who is going to be the target audience for that kind of message?

552
01:01:58,460 --> 01:02:10,620
And again, plural audiences. I said, okay, let's get dive deeper.

553
01:02:10,630 --> 01:02:14,460
Who will be in that lab? Findings.

554
01:02:14,930 --> 01:02:18,710
Scientist So we'll have people who are doing the laboratory work.

555
01:02:19,130 --> 01:02:27,370
Who else will be in that lab? You may also like students who might not know as much about the lab.

556
01:02:27,820 --> 01:02:28,060
Yeah,

557
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:37,609
so students or trainees who else will be on that lap could be people who are dealing with disposing of sharps or something like that from the lab,

558
01:02:37,610 --> 01:02:42,150
but are not scientists with that same level of training, environmental, health services people.

559
01:02:42,170 --> 01:02:48,610
People are taking out the garbage, people are cleaning the room. They all have needs about to know about laboratory safety and the chemicals.

560
01:02:48,610 --> 01:02:56,650
And as a are in that room, I worked in a lab once that was also the office of the Filovirus.

561
01:02:57,270 --> 01:03:03,100
There is another kind of audience, people who might be passing through that physical space but have no particular connection to it.

562
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:10,160
Yeah. Research participants who are coming in to participate in this better.

563
01:03:10,190 --> 01:03:13,990
So now we've got people who aren't even employees who aren't even part of that,

564
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:20,420
that the worker force who maybe they're only once and yet we still need to think about their safety,

565
01:03:20,750 --> 01:03:26,480
all of whom may need to be exposed to the information that we're giving them and respond to it.

566
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:34,249
And maybe also like administration that would have to like fund efforts to serve our needs.

567
01:03:34,250 --> 01:03:39,080
Thinking about are there structural things? Are the things that we need to make sure are in place?

568
01:03:39,380 --> 01:03:46,400
I'm thinking about like that hoods or you know, safety equipment that needs to be there, maintained things like that.

569
01:03:46,790 --> 01:03:52,639
Right. That's the context as we've grabbed the context here in a physical location.

570
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:55,810
And that really helped us recognize that there's multiple audiences.

571
01:03:57,530 --> 01:04:02,719
Why do they care? This is, in one sense, obvious.

572
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:06,530
In another sense not. Why do they care? So they stay safe.

573
01:04:08,270 --> 01:04:14,060
But the nuances are important. Like the people who are the lab technicians who are working in that environment.

574
01:04:14,270 --> 01:04:17,900
They also care about is this screwing up my ability to do my job?

575
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:24,080
Like, if I have to wear a safety gear that makes it impossible for me to do certain tasks, that's a major problem.

576
01:04:25,110 --> 01:04:30,979
Whereas the patient who may be walking through has no thought about this and an assumption of safety.

577
01:04:30,980 --> 01:04:39,310
And we just want to make sure that they stay safe. What's my goal?

578
01:04:39,430 --> 01:04:45,490
And we touched upon this. Part of this might be for the workers like specific behaviors that we want them to engage in.

579
01:04:45,850 --> 01:04:49,170
Always make sure to wear your lab coat and put on your glasses before doing this.

580
01:04:49,180 --> 01:04:58,569
Always storing these chemicals here in this way kind of stuff. For the people who may be passing through, this might be much simpler.

581
01:04:58,570 --> 01:05:05,560
Maybe don't touch this. You know, here is where you can be safely.

582
01:05:06,070 --> 01:05:14,440
You know, I think about like the hard hats signs you see in construction areas like you didn't nobody gets passed here without a hat, period.

583
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:20,280
End of conversation. Because that's the level of communication that's necessary at that entry point.

584
01:05:20,300 --> 01:05:23,840
You don't need to get into the nuance. You just need to make sure that everybody is walking through with a hat.

585
01:05:24,860 --> 01:05:32,629
We kind of jumped it, but I'm thinking about the context here, and I think of two contexts one being prevention and the other being you're consulting

586
01:05:32,630 --> 01:05:36,830
this because you're already in an emergency and you need to know what to do now.

587
01:05:36,830 --> 01:05:38,900
And so you've got to be direct. Awesome.

588
01:05:39,470 --> 01:05:47,840
Notice you've just said there are two fundamentally different needs, one of which is the prevention is the other one is the response need.

589
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:52,010
We might need two radically different communications to meet those needs.

590
01:05:52,490 --> 01:05:56,240
One of them is the slide for storage of the chemicals.

591
01:05:56,450 --> 01:05:59,899
The other one is the really simple and straightforward.

592
01:05:59,900 --> 01:06:08,970
If you have been exposed, what do you do right now? Try to combine those two things into one translation is likely to make both of them bad.

593
01:06:11,860 --> 01:06:19,100
Because they're meeting fundamentally different informational needs. And in fact, that's a really good example.

594
01:06:19,290 --> 01:06:29,090
If you think about emergency procedure stuff, defibrillators is what the design of a cardiac do for the later.

595
01:06:30,290 --> 01:06:33,949
It's really straightforward. Do this, do that, do that.

596
01:06:33,950 --> 01:06:37,309
And like no details. Just here's where it goes.

597
01:06:37,310 --> 01:06:40,520
Here's a picture. Put this thing here, push that button and we're done.

598
01:06:42,710 --> 01:06:49,700
But if I was talking about how do I design one of those things? If I'm talking about where do I want to put them in the whole different conversation.

599
01:06:51,020 --> 01:06:55,020
You. All right. We could go through more of these examples.

600
01:06:56,770 --> 01:07:01,510
I want to move on briefly because I want to cover one other thing today, but.

601
01:07:03,070 --> 01:07:09,220
Notice the level of detail here, how many different audiences we could come up with about this microphone.

602
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:16,710
So many different, specific communication goals might exist and then the different barriers that might pop up as we're trying to achieve.

603
01:07:18,310 --> 01:07:25,840
This is the level in which are watching and challenging every communication we talk about in this course, because I don't want to.

604
01:07:25,940 --> 01:07:32,980
Oh, so I'm communicating with teens when, where, why, etc.

605
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:37,479
Dive deep. That's where you really get into the question of whether or not something is

606
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:40,840
going to be memorable in order to actually make an impact to that audience.

607
01:07:42,430 --> 01:07:42,730
All right.

608
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:55,930
The last thing I want to do before we hit our five minute mark, which was very about 5 minutes ago, but so it is to talk briefly about personas.

609
01:08:13,460 --> 01:08:21,210
You read this article about personas? I spent a lot of time on it in this course.

610
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:29,620
This is a technique nearly is one of the practical things that I can give you that will help you in every communication you do.

611
01:08:30,870 --> 01:08:36,839
You don't going to do this when you're just talking one on one with somebody. If you're designing a campaign, any kind of campaign,

612
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:44,850
this kind of an approach is really valuable because making a persona forces you to be

613
01:08:44,850 --> 01:08:50,790
concrete and defining the possible segments of your audience and representing not just them,

614
01:08:50,790 --> 01:08:55,410
not just as stereotypes of the labels, but as people.

615
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:07,409
Personas, when done well, can represent this kind of idea of I have multiple audiences for a given communication.

616
01:09:07,410 --> 01:09:13,680
So if we were doing the laboratory safety communication thing, I would make a persona of a lab tech,

617
01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:18,420
another one of a researcher, and otherwise of a person who's just walking through the room.

618
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:29,740
Another one of the person who has to come in and collect garbage. That allows us to get into things like what are their information needs?

619
01:09:30,010 --> 01:09:34,719
As Andrew pointed out, sometimes those needs are going to be about how do I need to do my daily life?

620
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:37,180
And sometimes those needs are going to be about very different moments.

621
01:09:41,660 --> 01:09:48,140
And this last point that I want to really put forward, because there's a difference between looking at.

622
01:09:50,020 --> 01:09:53,130
Language of we're communicating, too.

623
01:09:53,430 --> 01:09:57,600
I'm not picking on anybody, but I'll use some of the language that came out, you know,

624
01:09:59,490 --> 01:10:06,870
people receiving nutrition communications in a predominantly, you know, predominantly Latinx community.

625
01:10:08,570 --> 01:10:12,200
Okay. So that tells me what they're getting at, tells me something about their race or ethnicity.

626
01:10:12,510 --> 01:10:17,090
This doesn't make me imagine a person, somebody who would have values.

627
01:10:18,210 --> 01:10:22,580
And goals and surprising things.

628
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:31,090
When you do a good persona, you bring in all of these kinds of things, including you.

629
01:10:31,090 --> 01:10:37,370
Give them a name. That's actually one of the more important things that we're going to spend a little time later on in this course.

630
01:10:37,370 --> 01:10:46,450
When we talk about concreteness, the power of naming things as changing the way in which you respond to what.

631
01:10:47,490 --> 01:10:55,500
This stuff, but things that they care about, their connection to the topic, the fact that the fate of the planet.

632
01:10:55,530 --> 01:10:59,160
Why do they care about it? Always critical.

633
01:10:59,190 --> 01:11:04,230
You know why you care about something? Why do they care about it?

634
01:11:07,480 --> 01:11:10,750
What do they care about their connection to this content?

635
01:11:15,240 --> 01:11:16,560
If somebody is we're talking about.

636
01:11:18,260 --> 01:11:27,830
Well, actually, to use the example that Daniel brought up, like we're talking about asthma and I am a mayor of a small community.

637
01:11:27,980 --> 01:11:36,500
I might care about that as a general. I want my population to be healthy if I am the parent of a kid with severe asthma.

638
01:11:36,710 --> 01:11:41,900
I have a radically different exposure to that emotional connection to that topic.

639
01:11:42,740 --> 01:11:46,120
And the more that we know that, the more that we can change our communications to a life to.

640
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:52,310
So I'll show you a couple examples.

641
01:11:53,340 --> 01:12:00,030
These are all pulled from sites whose government has actually had these number of sites on plain language and developing a precedent.

642
01:12:00,780 --> 01:12:06,750
This is an example of a persona that was developed for a government to think about

643
01:12:06,990 --> 01:12:12,330
helping somebody find appropriate information about a topic of this case government jobs.

644
01:12:13,140 --> 01:12:16,230
Notice the characteristics of this. We have a picture, we have a person.

645
01:12:16,230 --> 01:12:25,290
We know where they live. But the core element over here is this is somebody who wants a new job so that she can spend more time with her child.

646
01:12:26,260 --> 01:12:28,720
So she needs to be able to access information.

647
01:12:30,070 --> 01:12:37,030
From her phone will know how to navigate the process and then to be able to find the information that's relevant to her.

648
01:12:37,300 --> 01:12:45,830
That's what she cares about. And having this in mind allows us to then think through, okay, how will this site with that information be?

649
01:12:46,340 --> 01:12:53,300
What will we do to ensure that this person can quickly get going on the site

650
01:12:53,510 --> 01:12:57,650
in productive ways and then be able to find the jobs relevant to her area?

651
01:13:00,420 --> 01:13:05,940
Here's a different persona that was used in the development of information for different types of healthcare professionals.

652
01:13:06,450 --> 01:13:15,870
So here Alicia is a family doctor, and her goal, this is a little small time, but I wanted to just give you the screenshot.

653
01:13:16,860 --> 01:13:20,130
Alicia is opening a small medical practice with two other doctors.

654
01:13:20,730 --> 01:13:24,750
She is tasked with researching the government's mandate for electronic medical records and

655
01:13:24,750 --> 01:13:28,260
wants to know if there are any incentives available to help her practice avoid penalties.

656
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:37,820
Very concrete, specific information on the. So now we got to think about, okay, so is she aware of her electronic health records?

657
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:45,220
Of course she is. Generally, those topics which she is concerned about is how do I make sure to not screw up as I'm building my new practice?

658
01:13:45,850 --> 01:13:51,340
Okay, great. I can think of lots of parallels to individual health communications that are like that.

659
01:13:51,580 --> 01:13:54,640
I understand about cancer screening. What am I supposed to do?

660
01:14:00,740 --> 01:14:04,070
And there's also this section here, frustrations and challenges.

661
01:14:05,140 --> 01:14:06,370
That's equally important.

662
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:12,100
Helping us understand, think about what are the barriers that I might need to design around in the way in which I'm communicating?

663
01:14:15,210 --> 01:14:22,590
If you want more. This one's about a couple with Claudia has a family history of breast cancer.

664
01:14:23,900 --> 01:14:29,210
And so they were looking for information about cancer risk and cancer screening.

665
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:39,090
There's a language issue that we might need to be concerned about. The information going to be understandable to them.

666
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:44,490
But at its core, we have a clear purpose. These are people who.

667
01:14:46,190 --> 01:14:49,660
They not have necessarily lots of tech savvy, but they have a clear purpose.

668
01:14:50,060 --> 01:14:53,990
They have a sense of emotional connection to their health risk, and they want to learn more about it.

669
01:15:02,030 --> 01:15:05,240
This feels like work. I've done this a number of times.

670
01:15:06,330 --> 01:15:11,130
But let me give you a quick closing example of the situation in which personas were really helpful.

671
01:15:12,390 --> 01:15:19,470
I once worked with a group of students here on developing a nutrition education curriculum

672
01:15:20,070 --> 01:15:27,510
to be given to junior high school age kids at some of the housing developments,

673
01:15:27,780 --> 01:15:38,690
low income housing developments around our. And when they started to try to think about developing their curriculum, I asked them to make personas.

674
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:43,490
When they finally did that came back. They had five personas.

675
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:47,490
Two of them were about.

676
01:15:48,530 --> 01:15:56,540
The kids themselves won, including a kid who was already really engaged with the idea of nutrition and wanted to be part of thinking about food.

677
01:15:56,540 --> 01:16:02,990
And one of the kids who was really not engaged noticing that everything need to be really different forms of communication for them.

678
01:16:03,590 --> 01:16:06,829
One was for the instructors of the curriculum. What are their goals?

679
01:16:06,830 --> 01:16:10,190
What are they trying to accomplish? How does the curriculum need to be designed to meet their needs?

680
01:16:11,850 --> 01:16:16,799
And to relate it to parents who, while not being directly exposed to the curriculum,

681
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:22,680
were nonetheless going to be critical consumers of the information and how with their relationship to the topics,

682
01:16:22,680 --> 01:16:26,310
to the food, the question of of recipes and life.

683
01:16:27,030 --> 01:16:34,140
Would they actually be able to afford the recipes or the ideas that were coming up in this curriculum was a key feature of one of those personas.

684
01:16:35,070 --> 01:16:38,850
Somebody came like, Yeah, you can tell me. It'd be wonderful for me to be making, you know.

685
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:44,670
So I take shrimp, but I'm never going to be able to afford that. So I'm going to reject the communication if that's what's being told to me.

686
01:16:46,250 --> 01:16:49,670
And because they did that and laid them out,

687
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:57,150
what they brought back at the end of that project was something that really was well aligned to each of those audiences.

688
01:16:57,170 --> 01:17:01,340
They had thought about what the barriers were, what the needs were of each of those specific audiences.

689
01:17:01,730 --> 01:17:06,960
Some of the best projects that I've seen, I was teaching my class. So here's.

690
01:17:07,210 --> 01:17:08,620
This is why I want to show you this.

691
01:17:08,620 --> 01:17:16,990
I'm not going to push it too hard, but I do think it's a valuable idea for you to hold on to when we think about audiences and.

692
01:17:18,070 --> 01:17:21,820
All right. I am now out of time.

693
01:17:23,330 --> 01:17:45,060
So. What you want to remember so deep that if you.

694
01:17:51,390 --> 01:18:05,250
If this is the enemy, you know your audience.

695
01:18:15,180 --> 01:18:28,270
So clear goals have a clear goal. Can't make audience plural because you're going to have more than one.

696
01:18:28,940 --> 01:18:39,970
You just had an ass out there. Know your audiences that you're named personas in your persona.

697
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:52,810
Remember what we're trying to do on this one.

698
01:18:55,570 --> 01:19:10,120
Sit down, focus on one moment, because I've been good enough to try to do two different messages at the same time.

699
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:28,490
You're not going to do well. Well, you know, it was a perfect transition, by the way, to what we're reading about from this class.

700
01:19:28,510 --> 01:19:49,990
Yes. Be conscious of how you're showing up as the communicator between speeches and what we're actually.

701
01:19:53,470 --> 01:20:06,240
Collective lived experiences. Good. Great.

702
01:20:06,670 --> 01:20:22,090
All right. So next class we are getting into simple how to have the book chapters really focus on the story of one message.

703
01:20:22,180 --> 01:20:28,480
One for our goal. Did you say someone had a link to an audio book?

704
01:20:30,310 --> 01:20:39,760
Did we pass it on? I know. I don't know.

705
01:20:40,930 --> 01:20:54,450
So here I. I feel like I'm working on the country by focusing on the war.

706
01:20:54,450 --> 01:21:02,520
But I think that you are getting ready for something like that.

707
01:21:05,820 --> 01:21:16,649
You're not finished yet. You are on fire in your research articles.

708
01:21:16,650 --> 01:21:35,280
I that I do not want to say I realized that I heard about the audio,

709
01:21:37,510 --> 01:21:52,670
but I it's like it's you know, I knew that one was coming and I was like, oh, actually.

710
01:21:55,980 --> 01:22:10,530
Okay. I mean, that's that's how I do it, you know, I think yeah, I don't I don't understand.

711
01:22:11,670 --> 01:22:24,960
If you want to fight for getting something.

712
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:29,420
I know it's. I don't know. Uh huh.

713
01:22:30,110 --> 01:22:38,320
Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

714
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:47,620
Just tell me more.

715
01:22:50,190 --> 01:22:58,250
Yeah, I think more.

716
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:06,540
It's more serious. Yeah.

717
01:23:06,540 --> 01:23:11,510
If you see her. So. Oh, yeah.

718
01:23:11,700 --> 01:23:17,100
Oh, happy to do so. Oh, that's a great idea.

719
01:23:19,090 --> 01:23:26,819
A little name tent. Yeah, I'm doing that.

720
01:23:26,820 --> 01:23:31,350
That's how it works.

721
01:23:31,350 --> 01:23:40,560
Well, in Portland, runs like this. The years that I had to be teaching in 1755, the auditorium without this element,

722
01:23:40,590 --> 01:23:51,030
looking at how we must do it here on Zoom last year because that they see everybody's name underneath their their pictures,

723
01:23:51,300 --> 01:24:12,090
very easy to start learning everyone's names. And I want to see where we interpret your market.

724
01:24:13,350 --> 01:24:18,000
Thank you. I just can't even say that.

725
01:24:18,300 --> 01:24:27,520
What? She wants it that way. All right.

726
01:24:28,290 --> 01:24:38,350
I think I got everything. I don't know.

727
01:24:56,240 --> 01:24:56,930
I was the.
