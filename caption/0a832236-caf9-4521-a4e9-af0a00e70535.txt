1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:27,350
So we do so because there's a lot of money and there's like one thing.

2
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:32,470
I was like, Yeah, let's.

3
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:43,770
What? That. She's not going to give me. Like, This is just me better yet.

4
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,570
But she was like, Yeah, yeah, you don't want to deal with that.

5
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:58,580
They would, you know, like make out their size with the length of paper towels.

6
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:05,400
And we're like, this place is not my concern.

7
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:14,570
Oh yeah, it's quite off our back yard either, because the whole volleyball back there.

8
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:25,550
Let's see. Yes. Yeah.

9
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:38,040
And to print them and stuff like that.

10
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:45,140
I was really surprised by that.

11
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:52,379
Yeah. So what's in this housekeeping experience today?

12
00:01:52,380 --> 00:02:03,000
So just give me a moment. So for more students who have symptoms or have actually tested positive for COVID,

13
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:07,380
not many in this class we had the graduate class, a 10th of the advanced.

14
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:18,600
I think that's probably yeah. So these people will be aware the general community level of COVID for Washtenaw

15
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:23,429
County is currently high and it was a consensus the CDC recommendations

16
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:32,940
to mask when you you're indoors so I think you guys might want to think about that some of you and of course that's your choice to do it.

17
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,170
But I'm just telling you, we've had some reports in this news.

18
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:42,390
Just be aware if you have symptoms, the most important thing is stay home and rest.

19
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:50,940
You get tested and also know do not have a panic about assignments for classes or any of that stuff.

20
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:59,340
Scotland I have been teaching I said this announcement to the whole class but it's got I've been teaching for two years due to pandemic.

21
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:05,610
We can teach virtually we can teach a person. We are good at providing accommodations for anybody who needs them.

22
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:10,079
So we want this stuff out. So please don't worry.

23
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:16,290
If you are not feeling up, you sick and you are at home and not feeling up to participating in the course

24
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:21,119
by doing the readings or doing the assignments like keep in touch with us,

25
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,720
keep communicating, never lost accommodations we can make for everyone.

26
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:33,740
We do not want to add to anybody's stress if they're sick. My thinking, having them think about all the things they might be missing in class.

27
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:43,590
Okay. Well, the other thing is today we are going to have the policy sound here immediately, the calls for an hour and a half.

28
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:51,899
So pretty jam myself and I think Professor Graham will be here, too, will be here for an hour and a half if you're already itching and getting.

29
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,260
So this is not the first written assignment. You have some questions.

30
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:00,159
Come and talk to us. This is a thing in the news that is bugging you, that is helpful.

31
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:03,540
So you want to just come and talk to me about that? Okay.

32
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:08,570
Feel free to stop in for a little bit of time.

33
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:12,420
A lot of time with any life. This room is ours for that space.

34
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:17,610
Okay, so let's make the most of it. And then the policy seminar just every week.

35
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:26,430
So hopefully he can begin helping them. And if you're sick, by the way, if you want a one on one with any of us, just email the teaching team.

36
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:31,290
You don't need to have time to chat with the executive.

37
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:37,170
All right. And check in with any any warnings you might have about the plans.

38
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:44,850
And so I'm going to have a couple more minutes.

39
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:56,260
Let me get everything organized eventually found that think that's super that's great even be singing take shelter didn't have one oh to.

40
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:05,280
Where did they go? It's almost like, oh, my God.

41
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:10,500
Yes, she's all right.

42
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:18,050
This is a I know it seems a little bit high school, but it's got to be very helpful to me from my terrible about names and faces.

43
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:22,680
I will try my best and this is going to help close.

44
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:33,930
So do they work with me? I'm doing a bit of work on that list of all I can study is maternal mortality and lifting healthy eating as well.

45
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:39,900
So we're going to talk a little bit about some of those issues, the readings, the materials for this class.

46
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,970
Reading. Right. And I hope that you were able to give a little bit out.

47
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,890
Those became part of your decision.

48
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:54,270
Also going to do some group exercises based around this four s model,

49
00:05:54,900 --> 00:06:00,690
which is one way of thinking out of millions of ways of thinking about that, we can see.

50
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:09,059
And so we're going to combine the two things. That's the case study being maternal mortality and have you guys working groups to explore some

51
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:16,710
of the dimensions of those problems and think about some ways to advocate for improvements.

52
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:21,150
So we're going to be doing that's a conceptual that we're going to be doing quite a bit.

53
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:27,780
And so hopefully we get to do this during the run of the course and have fun working together.

54
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:36,270
We do have work for the group exercises, decides if you have a device with you, which most of you guys do.

55
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:42,750
Have a look. On the camera side. There is a downward knee under today's course materials.

56
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:46,080
You'll be using that for the group exercise if you want to have it open.

57
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:52,560
If you don't have a device or you just want to be old school. We also have these, of course, Margaret's Post-it notes.

58
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:59,610
And you can also come use the whiteboard for your brainstorming so it's not you must have a device in this environment.

59
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:05,650
So thinking of it. So.

60
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:10,190
Just a little clarification.

61
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:17,630
Housekeeping. I'm going to talk for a little bit and we can have a bit of a Q&A about today's topic, maternal mortality.

62
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:22,220
And then we're going to turn that into a group exercise of discussion.

63
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:27,980
And then we're going to come back together as a class and reflect a little bit on what we just did.

64
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:36,390
Think this is my daughter so considerably, but sentimentality.

65
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:41,270
She is now six and a half, which is not good time quickly.

66
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:46,580
But she's wearing a onesie that my friend Drew, which is custom made Michigan.

67
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:52,960
So I'm looking on that, which is adorable. And she was born over the hospital.

68
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:58,120
And so, you know, I just love every excuse to show your picture.

69
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:01,900
My baby. All right.

70
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:10,840
So with the caveat that the president wants highlighted and I'm aware that I'm describing it as maternal mortality,

71
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:15,460
the set of problems that are related. We're going to talk about that in a minute.

72
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:22,810
And there are other ways to describe the situation. And I also like the phrase maternal wellness.

73
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,360
It's it's going to hit people differently in this country.

74
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:33,580
I think it probably has a little bit already if you've explored some of the readings and materials in the podcast as well.

75
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:42,790
So let's be kind to each other in this discussion. But I would approach this as a policy problem,

76
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:52,030
and this is a very important only because when you are advocating in any context, it's not a terrible policy.

77
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,230
What have a good idea what the problem is that you're trying to solve.

78
00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:05,260
And maternal mortality is a good issue for this because there are multiple different ways you could define this as a policy for me.

79
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:13,750
So what I want all of you to do now is think back to any preparation you did for this course in terms of readings for the podcast.

80
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:17,620
And give me your interpretation just personally.

81
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:22,510
How do you how would you approach maternal mortality as a policy problem?

82
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:27,460
What is the problem here that a policy action could address?

83
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:34,060
And there are no wrong answers necessarily. There's lots of different ones.

84
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:49,129
Yes, please. I remember that stick out to me was I think researchers at the American College of OB-GYN did some research

85
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:56,900
and found that I think they said 60% of maternal deaths were preventable and considered preventable.

86
00:09:57,770 --> 00:10:00,889
So I think a policy that could address that is just, I don't know,

87
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:10,370
policies that focus on provider education in maternal care and maybe just generally stipulations about maternal care in hospitals and organizations.

88
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:19,930
And so here you're emphasizing this isn't just about maternity, is about preventable mortality in your interpretation.

89
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:23,810
Right. And so then you're it's good that you're doing this.

90
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:26,180
We don't have to immediately jump to some solutions.

91
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:32,569
But if this problem is defined as preventable, maybe that would make people sit up and pay more attention.

92
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:36,680
But this is not just a tragedy. It's a preventable tragedy.

93
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:38,550
That's what makes it is such a serious issue.

94
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:45,919
You know, it's we got to change this one thing during the podcast that I listen to and then I can't remember the exact number,

95
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:57,830
but in one of the papers it was like 2.1% or minorities are 2.1 times more likely to pass away from like a maternal and a maternal mortality.

96
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:06,200
And so one thing that I thought was really interesting in the podcast was that they did simulations to try and whenever you're in that situation,

97
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:10,129
you're just going to react and they're not going to have any biases towards helping the mother out.

98
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:14,570
So I thought that was and that could be a policy thing to implement more simulations and things like that.

99
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:19,760
Right. And I think that 2.5, because it's very distressing and it's specific to black women.

100
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,420
So and there are other disparities, too.

101
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:29,050
It's not because inequalities, when you compare different groups in society to white women, there are a lot of disparities that.

102
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:33,200
So you could frame this around. This is a problem for equity.

103
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:39,680
This is a problem of injustice. What the heck is going on to cause this disproportionate outcome?

104
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:40,490
Please.

105
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:50,360
I'm kind of along the same lines they were talking about whether I think potentially playing the role of black women have a higher mortality rate.

106
00:11:50,870 --> 00:12:00,829
So I guess. Suggesting policy that addresses like white supremacy and bias in the health care system and trying to alleviate that.

107
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:04,850
So you can see those rates kind of become more and more white.

108
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:09,010
Thank you. And so who wants to tell me what weathering is?

109
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:16,240
Doesn't have to be Taylor. Anybody else pick up on this, please?

110
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:22,780
I think it's just describing that the experience of experiencing racial inequities

111
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:27,390
throughout your life is itself a health issue and becomes a health issue.

112
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:34,300
It's obviously more prevalent when you have a child and you're going in and trying to bear that child and stay alive.

113
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:37,419
And so it's a when we talk specifically about women,

114
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:45,280
we talk about talking about the effects of lived experience and stress and other factors on the body, specifically on the genes.

115
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:52,479
And so there is studies looking at the nature of telomeres as a measure of how healthy

116
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:57,820
somebody is and relating that to stressful life events and other experiences.

117
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:04,660
So it's a huge problem and quite a distressing one because it's difficult to think about, well,

118
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:10,420
I'm going to have to change this entire system in order to try and address this problem.

119
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,330
Would like to come and get something with a definition of confusion.

120
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:23,860
And I think a lot of the readings focused a lot about how women's health in general is underfunded and I guess a

121
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:42,160
policy initiative to address that funding issue and the sort of things that we can access to address systemic issues.

122
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,090
Right.

123
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:52,240
So, Bridget, it's for you as long as the issue of access to care, and I think we can even quantify that for you and say access to adequate care,

124
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:58,410
good enough quality care, access to appropriate, culturally appropriate care might be a positive.

125
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:05,110
This is the person who's helping you, but their experiences reflect your own in any way.

126
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:07,390
Right is an important concern that's raised,

127
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:15,400
particularly in the study where they interviewed 100 mothers and they had them report back their expert experiences.

128
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:19,090
And I should note I'm saying women and mothers a lot.

129
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:25,900
I also want to point out that some people who don't define themselves as women, too.

130
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:33,490
So please, let's be aware of to not language. But I think that doesn't negate the fact that women's health is also a really important issue.

131
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:38,770
So I had a bit of fun saying, how else could we define this as a policy?

132
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:48,249
One of the key parts of this trust of the by the way, women in general, particularly black women,

133
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:54,020
because the community was subjected to historically and still subjected to and in Georgia,

134
00:14:54,460 --> 00:15:02,380
not so long to go with the performing medical procedures on pregnant Native Americans.

135
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:12,759
And I'm going to just try and push the bad cycle that's going on that women don't

136
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:18,250
trust the profession and kind of creates prejudice within doctors sometimes,

137
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:29,320
I think certainly for women. And so we're thinking here about historical injustice and historical disparities as well as contemporary experiences.

138
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:33,520
I think that's very important to note. This is not something that's just in the past.

139
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:38,739
And this, again, connects with what you're saying about this being a systemic problem,

140
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:44,350
potentially, that you're bringing in to like the physician patient relationship in this session.

141
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:51,070
Okay. I will attempt to get that point on.

142
00:15:51,100 --> 00:16:02,160
So like one of the readings was talking about like the medicalization of how a lot of guys resort to doing C-sections even when they're unnecessary.

143
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:06,340
And I think that could kind of be thought of as like an insurance policy problem

144
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:13,470
because doctors do receive like more money if they do C-sections rather than not.

145
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,930
So it is also a money thing. Yeah.

146
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:22,960
So we'd like to try and solve a lot of problems in the U.S. for good or ill, with payment incentives and things like that.

147
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:28,840
And so one of the things that's going to come up a lot in my focus is what are these incentive structures look like?

148
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:37,690
Do they create perverse incentives potentially for providing some procedures or choosing between procedures in situations like this?

149
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:45,280
I think one of the things that got in the readings was the birthing centers.

150
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:48,399
And I think that if we are able to create policies that combine more of those,

151
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:53,950
it might be important because it seems like they support their pregnancy and after their pregnancy,

152
00:16:53,950 --> 00:17:01,839
which is really important to reduce the mortality levels and not have it such a cold shoulder maybe of the medical system.

153
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:06,219
When you're just going in for something, that's fine. Yeah, absolutely.

154
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:10,990
And you bring up a really good point here. One of the things that blows my mind about this is.

155
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:16,070
The way that we define internal death or injury.

156
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:24,650
And we have to make some distinctions here. And the kicker is different states make distinctions in different ways, of course,

157
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:33,730
between somebody who dies from being pregnant, somebody who dies during birth, and somebody who dies in the year after birth.

158
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:39,320
And there might be different causes and consequences of policy framings for all of this,

159
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:44,690
which is one of the reasons why this is quite an intricate, complicated issue.

160
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:54,950
And Michigan does make a distinction between people who die while pregnant, people who die giving birth and people who die afterwards.

161
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:59,140
I think it was really interesting in the reading how it talked about how there

162
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:04,050
is a shortage of OBGYN doctors right now and how it's going to still get worse.

163
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:10,700
And then they also mentioned rural areas, how there's just not like in some places there's not even the way we do.

164
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:13,970
And doctors hope that prenatal care, they're not able to do that.

165
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:20,960
I think something that like should be like trying to invest more and like LBJ and doctors and especially like

166
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:29,270
diversifying like diversifying the field as well to try to avoid some of those stigmas that we talked about early like.

167
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:35,510
So I'm just doing a project right now on rural health and hospitals and it's super depressing.

168
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:41,690
So many of these hospitals are in professional shortage areas, which is, again,

169
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:45,830
a policy definition of whether you do not have enough medical professionals in your area.

170
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:54,050
And so it is a serious concern, trying to provide enough adequate access to care in those areas.

171
00:18:54,830 --> 00:19:00,440
And there are a lot of people who have to drive a long way. And so no ambulance service necessarily.

172
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:08,450
So I'm getting a upfront education in that right now. If you ever want to talk to me about critical access hospitals and how bad they are.

173
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:14,000
Yeah. So this is a really good discussion.

174
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,560
I don't want to cut it short.

175
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:24,800
The way I read summarizes a little bit and the word is a lot of words on one side, but this is a really complicated set of problems.

176
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:32,360
I think that we should best define this think about maternal mortality as a cluster related issues.

177
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:38,480
And this is not a comprehensive list. This is just my list of different framings based on some literature.

178
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:44,390
But there are probably other things that you can think of and other ways you could define this as a problem.

179
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:52,610
It's an important things to note. This often gets framed as an issue like literacy for people giving birth.

180
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:59,120
And people know the disparity between the United States and the rate in the U.S. and other countries,

181
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:03,980
which, due to some fragmentary data, look a lot worse than it does now.

182
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:06,840
But it's still not good compared to other rich countries.

183
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:16,819
We there are decent jobs and schools, a disparity among places in the U.S. So state to state, there are some places where the thought was.

184
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:22,340
So there are clearly some residual policy political factors in the mix.

185
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:28,550
We mentioned time brutality, not just during pregnancy, but after birth.

186
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:32,780
Thing we didn't mention, which I think is a really important one,

187
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:44,510
is there's actually a problem of defining these incidences of mortality, finding instances of injury and this problems with data.

188
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:56,150
So I read the piece where they were trying to go through and figure out why did you guys maternal mortality, not what did the graph look so steep?

189
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:04,490
And part of that is about ascertainment of maternal mortality, trying to measure maternal mortality, which is really difficult.

190
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:10,290
And it's difficult globally as well, even more so in countries that don't have good death records.

191
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:16,670
There are many such countries, and here in all in the U.S. specifically, it pertains to a tick box.

192
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:21,980
Did anyone with that piece want to tell me a little bit about that? Yeah.

193
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:33,380
So I can't remember when they enacted it, but they put a box for pregnancy on the death certificate and you were able to mark that.

194
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:41,750
And because of that, like there were a lot of ticks for this specific cause, but when they were like going through them,

195
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:47,690
they saw that like an 88 year old woman who had died of something and her pregnancy box was ticked.

196
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:51,320
Right. So then they ended up modifying it.

197
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:59,830
So I think if I'm understanding this right, you only have that option for people aged like ten.

198
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,990
So we haven't really ended up doing check it.

199
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:11,150
Right. But you know, it's difficult it indicates a difficult policy problem for anybody who's doing policy work in the executive who has to think of.

200
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:16,640
How do I measure this? I don't measure this accurately because the real world consequences are really few.

201
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:22,100
If we suddenly discover that it's there's an artifact.

202
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:27,050
There are artifacts in the data that allow us to measure this 3-D correctly for a long time.

203
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:31,640
Where does that leave us as people who want to do evidence based policy?

204
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:38,030
There's still a lot of evidence that this is a very serious problem. What it's going to skew senses of priorities.

205
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:44,210
It's going to skew resource allocation. But even these small technical details can matter a lot in policy.

206
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:50,120
Well, that's something that we further bring up.

207
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:58,099
So particularly I thought the black woman, according to her piece, is a really good study.

208
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:07,579
Some white folks who are in California who interviewed, like I said, 100 black mothers, they did focus groups as well.

209
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:12,440
And they did a lot of good qualitative research and they were asking people about their experiences.

210
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,230
And so some of these findings come from that study,

211
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:24,050
particularly mental health and mental health care access at all stages of life before, during and after pregnancy.

212
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:31,909
Also, they spoke a lot about disempowerment and the idea that they weren't allowed to advocate for themselves in care settings,

213
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:40,160
which was a significant concern. And two, we have to talk about that some of the social determinants of health,

214
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:48,260
which I also think are political determinants of health, but you can deal with poverty and related problems,

215
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:53,270
people's insecurity in their lives, which might affect their income from the money they have,

216
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:58,069
it might affect their housing, it might affect transportation and ability to actually access care.

217
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:06,340
And that way it might affect their environment, but they might be in an insecure environment like that in terms of where they live

218
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:12,620
and crime rates or related with their situation and intimate partner violence.

219
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:20,509
So we're really talking about some very and this is before I get to the bullet point that says discrimination and injustice.

220
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:24,110
You know, notice I'm already talking about some.

221
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:29,410
There's big, broad problems here.

222
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:37,750
This is another way in which we need to think about this carefully, because if you're an organization advocating on this issue, where do you focus?

223
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:44,170
Where do you put your resources? Where do you want to start trying to unravel and tackle some of these problems?

224
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:51,040
That is a really important choice, and it's kind of the choice we're going to explore in the group exercise today.

225
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:56,800
So the last thing I wanted to touch on this bottom bullet here,

226
00:24:57,550 --> 00:25:05,770
I provided you with a lot of framings of this problem that are very much fully in the realm of public health health research.

227
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:12,130
It's how health researchers and advocates and health managers think about this problem.

228
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:16,600
There are competing framings, too, and that's something you have to consider as an advocate.

229
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:21,310
Other people's views of this problem, the population that you might be trying to help,

230
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:27,610
and that includes the idea is maybe this really should be something more

231
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:33,070
individualistic and around changing the individual behavior of the person giving birth.

232
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:41,230
There's a lot of advice given to people who would like to or are pregnant about their health and the

233
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:49,360
behaviors that they should adopt and that can shape into foregrounding things like substance abuse.

234
00:25:49,780 --> 00:26:00,609
When you listen to politicians talk about this issue, they quite often might catch on the ill health of the individual or the condition they're

235
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:06,220
in regarding substance abuse and treat that as the primary cause of the disease.

236
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:14,350
And so there's a tendency to kind of frame this around the individuals themselves and their characteristics and behaviors.

237
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:23,380
Another way to frame this that's quite common is, and I would say that shaded decriminalization of individual behavior while pregnant,

238
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:33,100
which we're seeing some smoke, isolated, little bit crazy cases of people getting arrested while pregnant in order to protect.

239
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:37,940
The child to the unborn child. Yeah.

240
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:41,450
So then that's to do with discretion of law enforcement.

241
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:45,290
I want to bring this to you that's often used,

242
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:51,080
which might be helpful to folks who are a little bit more on the right of the political spectrum to get more conservative.

243
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:58,010
It is often gets framed as like a family health issue rather than just a maternal health issue.

244
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:02,000
So that might be a framing that some advocates don't.

245
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:09,440
And also, it's a competing frame centered on infants that's about infant mortality.

246
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:15,110
And I think it's just good to be aware of that. Some people would want to focus more on health of mothers.

247
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,870
Some people would want to focus more on health of infants.

248
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:23,440
And you find that actually that's why I see mostly federal funding for research on this topic, too.

249
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:29,210
So we throw in a lot of friends and complicated ideas here.

250
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:33,650
Well, I'm going to let you guys sort this out a little bit.

251
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:40,010
So let me quickly introduce the moral opinion of use, and then we will move on to fights.

252
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:48,050
And I think it's very simple. It's full states of there are lots of different ways to advocate for change.

253
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:53,510
This is one out of a million and it's also one that we made up in France.

254
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:59,420
But I think it's quite helpful and I find it useful in teaching and so maybe you'll find it helpful to even practice.

255
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:07,060
Figure out where you sit. That means, where does your organizational group sit in the political system.

256
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:11,800
Right. Look at mobilization. Are you mean what resources do you have to hand?

257
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:18,400
Where do you sit in this whole structure of institutions that you talked about with Professor Greer in the prior class?

258
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,780
So it's kind of building on that. You simply stand.

259
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:29,290
What is your position on the issue? What is going to be your stance on maternal mortality?

260
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:36,340
Are you even going to define this as maternal mortality? And if so, you know what is going to be the thing that you want to see?

261
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:42,400
What is this problem definition and how do we address the problem that we strategize?

262
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:52,720
So how do you get rich when you sit in the construction and you stand your position and resources in order to take action?

263
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:58,149
So we're going to have you identified some actions as a group and then say so a

264
00:28:58,150 --> 00:29:02,110
lot of these class and in terms of advocacy is around communication and messaging.

265
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:10,000
So how do you take your position and your strategy and actually craft a message that can reach a target audience?

266
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:16,090
So I said, I'm going to have you do this kind of exercise multiple times.

267
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:19,750
So if you don't get everything right, speak away. I know you're all perfectionists.

268
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:24,910
That's all right. So we do want groups of about five or six.

269
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:30,160
I think five is enough for this class. So make make friends with your neighbors.

270
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:33,970
And we're going to have you take on the identity of different interest groups.

271
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:39,110
All right. This is where we have to move a little bit. I want to you to four groups.

272
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:42,430
I'm going to give you an identity out of this list.

273
00:29:45,340 --> 00:30:02,140
When I decided it was time to be because I heard you want to do all of that in a little while.

274
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,180
Yes. I think we want to make nice against.

275
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:31,900
If Texas is drafting these groups, they'll help you meet.

276
00:30:36,620 --> 00:31:03,590
Sorry. I know you don't like the idea of what has happened over time, so I want you to be just not.

277
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:12,710
It's like there's a reason I have a sister, so give me a finger.

278
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:17,060
Okay. You're in that group of three who has a fine group of five.

279
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:20,480
Put your hands up. Thank you. What have you come here?

280
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:25,100
What have you got up there? Why don't you come over here? Wonderful.

281
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:35,160
Thank you. Okay. I want you guys to be very careful and such a level.

282
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:39,520
Not right.

283
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:47,430
So we're really not going to see the.

284
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:51,500
All right, so to treat everybody.

285
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:59,540
Don't be fooled. It's sold yourself out.

286
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:15,530
Yeah. And you are gonna be ready by the end of the day for your report.

287
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:26,540
I guess that's fine. Oh, that's great.

288
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:31,580
So you got about 25 minutes.

289
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:37,730
Profits on the business?

290
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:49,720
Oh, yeah. Definitely easier to talk. Yeah, I guess so.

291
00:32:52,970 --> 00:33:02,510
Yes, I have my best friend at the gym in the middle of the gym?

292
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:22,790
Yeah. And she's making it look like we're just walking, you know, like TV service.

293
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:31,680
And do you realize when you, like, two miles an hour and someone calls?

294
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:37,310
Because I hate being where like. Like the reception.

295
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:46,190
So it's all right. It's not like a real, like, timer, just so.

296
00:33:46,190 --> 00:34:07,980
I'm sorry. Yeah, I'm on a website, so that's what I would like to reach every TRT shot or she is trying to get me available through this.

297
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:31,430
But, you know, so that's one of the benefits that they're not counting on and all sorts of basically this is is set to be implemented.

298
00:34:31,430 --> 00:34:39,490
There's one doctor that's on the same page.

299
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:50,090
I wrote a book about this and she also joined a committee in advancing bipartisan legislation to improve mental health outcomes.

300
00:34:51,410 --> 00:34:56,380
It's like that night when she was saying race, oh, access to support.

301
00:34:56,390 --> 00:35:10,480
That's the same race as a lot of people are going to be dying during childbirth.

302
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:16,750
She's not there.

303
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:33,890
So she's according to the press releases and that's obviously included totally restrategize what it is that.

304
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:45,000
Right. Just.

305
00:35:46,450 --> 00:36:05,559
I think so. This the idea that she just recently introduced bills to increase maternal vaccination rates and ensure

306
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:14,690
that vaccines are free of cost for Medicaid and targeting the people that have a medical crisis.

307
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:29,140
That's an expression of what this is about. So, yes, the issue is American resistance, but also access.

308
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:39,730
It sounds like you're saying let's focus on both money and things like vaccinations and stuff like that.

309
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:49,530
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

310
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:59,170
It's hard to hear that all this matter out of sight unless you're throwing a bunch of [INAUDIBLE] that.

311
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:11,110
Oh, yes, this is the CDC or screening tests or conditions such as congenital heart disease, cystic fibrosis, hearing in babies.

312
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:24,640
So she's sort of Castro explaining, I found that the problem is that it's a screening test for conditions.

313
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:44,890
She's petitioning for federal funding. So you're going to probably have a little bit over standard just because I have to say that, you know.

314
00:37:50,970 --> 00:38:17,140
There's much more to share with you on this issue, which is actually, if you do not know yet, what is really possible.

315
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:27,710
So I want to be more specific, reinforcing the goals of racial equality.

316
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:42,900
That's great. That's and stuff like that prevents that.

317
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:48,870
I don't ever talk about the infrastructure thing,

318
00:38:51,150 --> 00:39:03,030
but the point is not to mention that it seems like what she's got got which was was the head of the business relationship,

319
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:10,890
despite the fact that this was billed as a universal education.

320
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:34,720
So when the Republican leader of the Senate single, if there is a class action, your child, she authorized a racial bias training.

321
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:38,460
But do we have a situation like that?

322
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:47,140
We do not think that it is for to use, as I say.

323
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:53,480
So she is being ridiculous, which I think is the like one.

324
00:39:54,010 --> 00:40:08,340
I have seen her since she studies as a practicing and also you see that she's a Democrat.

325
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:18,890
She somewhere in the middle said as soon as possible.

326
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:44,700
I am not saying that since she's on that she's on the state level.

327
00:40:47,160 --> 00:41:04,620
The other ones don't want to do something like that.

328
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:12,780
So I don't know what is going to happen.

329
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:23,700
I'm going to get some strategy straightened out for you.

330
00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:41,250
So have you thought about how your friend from the campaign has reacted to the game strategies?

331
00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:58,980
So let's talk about to say I don't know plan that's what have to start calling into question here.

332
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:06,150
Oh yeah.

333
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:31,470
Yeah. Really connected with each other and I think college graduates who co-sponsored that should be.

334
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:40,780
Yes. Yeah. She's already doing that.

335
00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:48,270
You mean like really looking at it and this is like race.

336
00:42:50,290 --> 00:43:05,630
I guess I didn't know how much I was like, I know that I'm going to rally like, you don't.

337
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:12,010
You're going to know everything.

338
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:27,730
Yeah, yeah. I'm not going to tell you I'm doing everything right.

339
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:41,280
And I got a few things. They should change space for another plane.

340
00:43:41,530 --> 00:43:44,890
He wants it to be restricted. Yeah.

341
00:43:48,490 --> 00:43:53,050
I'll take a little while ago.

342
00:43:54,310 --> 00:43:58,150
You know how all this.

343
00:43:58,150 --> 00:44:02,530
All sorts of things about this stuff, is there anything else for important regarding her?

344
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:11,740
Really funny, right? Stuff.

345
00:44:13,210 --> 00:44:20,340
So she's got bigger challenges, like she says, like the tournament's right.

346
00:44:20,590 --> 00:44:34,150
Yeah. That's like our classrooms thing where I got I got it right.

347
00:44:34,690 --> 00:44:48,340
So, uh, also education is a big role for somebody that's going to be like,

348
00:44:48,990 --> 00:45:27,760
you give me an opportunity to show me what really makes education or whatever it is, whether it's something that's not necessarily a good thing.

349
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:34,470
What about her district she wants?

350
00:45:35,610 --> 00:45:40,630
I asked her about this.

351
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:46,490
I was trying to strategize, actually, that we have to account for other perspectives in.

352
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:54,020
This is my section on my right.

353
00:45:54,940 --> 00:46:00,879
Thank you for having me here.

354
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:23,260
So but you know, let's see, I don't think it is very particular about finding people at all the right thing to do,

355
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:31,060
but you have to have so you need to get down.

356
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:38,049
So you can't be afraid of people.

357
00:46:38,050 --> 00:46:45,120
Obviously, it's their what's your approach?

358
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:59,630
You know, how much how much better off than they are just to address the problem, you know, how does that work?

359
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:11,530
Because it's not like we see like, you know, absolute maximum.

360
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:24,940
It's kind of like allies, Republican or ruling.

361
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:30,280
I think the results are running.

362
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:36,310
You know, she's like, I guess against Democrats.

363
00:47:36,310 --> 00:47:47,480
That says our problem with that is that what's going in all caps also very predictable.

364
00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:48,550
Yeah that's.

365
00:47:49,020 --> 00:48:10,640
We would like to say that it was like I said, it's just like it's not like they're all like, I'm sure, you know, he says, like, I sounded very bad.

366
00:48:12,470 --> 00:48:17,760
Well, I would use the word because they're actually good.

367
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:31,469
Yeah. You know, I'm I'm not trying to tell them how many reasons.

368
00:48:31,470 --> 00:48:46,830
Access to the Secret Service.

369
00:48:50,490 --> 00:48:54,420
How would you ever do that?

370
00:48:54,420 --> 00:49:02,610
But, you know, it doesn't strike me like it should be.

371
00:49:03,210 --> 00:49:15,120
Like, you know, something that you say, like, you know, they're just talking about stuff that happens.

372
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:31,210
So you don't really criticize it because.

373
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:35,160
Right, you do. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, you do.

374
00:49:35,640 --> 00:50:01,920
Especially if your mindset is like, Oh, my God, Hussein is literally just like it was like, well, so I think that he's really interested in it.

375
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:28,130
But now they're also like, he's got to look at how he makes them go through the and he's got, you know, God, yeah, absolutely.

376
00:50:28,890 --> 00:50:36,440
Yeah. He's got a good chance of going out there and everything.

377
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:42,540
So I said, Yeah, right.

378
00:50:46,690 --> 00:51:00,940
Yeah. So I mean, I just think we just need to kind of like an outsider and.

379
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:11,480
Well, yeah.

380
00:51:12,130 --> 00:51:22,630
So I feel very bad and I don't know how we got started.

381
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:30,580
You know what I think is a failed state?

382
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:59,290
Well, his has just explained things like, Oh, you know what, I'm going to contribute to this.

383
00:51:59,770 --> 00:52:10,560
So I guess what we're trying to say is what we're talking about, our hearts and minds in.

384
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:15,290
Would you do that?

385
00:52:16,690 --> 00:52:44,790
I that, you know, there is such a focus on education, to solving parental discrimination.

386
00:52:46,350 --> 00:53:21,940
And I can't tell you which is a good reason I say that because like myself, I don't have only two years later, I should try this again.

387
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:38,300
So clearly there's a little disagreement and it's caused by the way that I was thinking about.

388
00:53:40,870 --> 00:53:52,680
We have to stop using steroids and the Boy Scouts.

389
00:53:55,030 --> 00:54:03,150
I know you can say my friends and I graduated.

390
00:54:03,410 --> 00:54:18,370
If you guys want to help, somebody says properly, that's the time in front of that kind of an economic issues,

391
00:54:18,370 --> 00:54:44,530
one that says married adults ran away from their lives by saying, well, I'm not like that because it was just so much in our strategy for change.

392
00:54:47,230 --> 00:54:59,210
People who are going to change that, you know, we got we kind of get to go to work.

393
00:54:59,690 --> 00:55:27,350
But I don't know if I mean, in all you're doing, I like the legislation is very focused on the direction of the escalation and other things.

394
00:55:28,390 --> 00:55:42,160
And I think what we should ask a lot of it's just about me and my family.

395
00:55:47,300 --> 00:56:02,680
The no, I don't think I am I anything but it's nothing.

396
00:56:04,850 --> 00:56:21,340
But I'm not bad for my problem and I think we are.

397
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:26,830
But especially against her, she came around.

398
00:56:27,730 --> 00:56:40,900
Think about what do we do right now on the strategy, trying to give us some pointers and say something about these 43 minutes.

399
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:45,700
Okay. So one of the things you have to wrap it up. Yeah.

400
00:56:48,570 --> 00:56:59,650
No, no, I think it does, but I think some really bad.

401
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:20,590
Yeah, I think so. Yeah. I don't know if you want to go last and it's certainly something that both

402
00:57:21,910 --> 00:57:36,130
senators racial disparity and so how do you think oh I that this is just like

403
00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:45,880
some kind of like approach to try to reform the system so that actually don't

404
00:57:47,320 --> 00:58:00,090
we don't want to listen to the other side and now we need to go reach them.

405
00:58:00,150 --> 00:58:26,920
All right. Let me just say, though, is that it's going to I was definitely objective in realizing that it would be like that.

406
00:58:30,970 --> 00:58:36,430
Yeah. I was just thinking about what's happening.

407
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:50,470
Not. There's not a single variable.

408
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:53,520
I don't know. Well, my brother asked.

409
00:58:54,050 --> 00:59:02,200
All I'm asking you to do that you're about to see already.

410
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:10,509
Very much so. My response was like, you know what you get?

411
00:59:10,510 --> 00:59:19,750
So is the problem with that? Maybe it's time we kind of got to address the problem.

412
00:59:20,540 --> 00:59:42,400
That's why I've got you all down there right now.

413
00:59:44,370 --> 00:59:52,060
And they're moving all over the place.

414
00:59:53,750 --> 00:59:57,620
Oh, yeah, me neither.

415
00:59:58,060 --> 01:00:04,410
But I saw. I don't have any money.

416
01:00:06,460 --> 01:00:20,800
Okay. The main thing I would say to do is to present this and then bring up the bill.

417
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:24,980
Right. Well, in.

418
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:30,130
In town.

419
01:00:30,190 --> 01:00:36,190
I see. It's all these guys here.

420
01:00:41,370 --> 01:00:46,390
All of you. This this vitalization action.

421
01:00:47,180 --> 01:01:01,650
Yeah. Right. You guys, look, I feel like you are too high at the base of the whole idea.

422
01:01:03,190 --> 01:01:12,410
That's okay. They don't want to put me in that group with you.

423
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:18,100
Yeah. So, actually, let's start with that.

424
01:01:18,370 --> 01:01:21,910
Let's go to the order up. That's what it has on the right.

425
01:01:26,950 --> 01:01:33,590
So for the purposes of the temptation, if you guys could focus on the actions that you would take under strategize,

426
01:01:34,110 --> 01:01:38,740
that might be and the reflection process.

427
01:01:39,970 --> 01:01:43,150
I know. You guys all here.

428
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:51,820
Can you be quiet? Oh, really? Okay, I'm taking my money, and I think we're going to go in the order.

429
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:59,680
We're going to present item of the board when you guys are out on the strategy to say,

430
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:04,170
and we're going to start with black women, everything is fabulous.

431
01:02:07,670 --> 01:02:17,200
Okay. So that is how we should say here.

432
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:25,250
So in terms of so our organization is very much a collective, prosperous movement that's focused on empowering,

433
01:02:25,250 --> 01:02:31,490
uplifting the voices who are most impacted by our words and actions and strategy for us.

434
01:02:31,730 --> 01:02:35,540
We don't have a ton of money or necessarily political power.

435
01:02:35,540 --> 01:02:48,859
And so our strategy focus on using buy in that we have the impacting most and my research and personal experiences and

436
01:02:48,860 --> 01:02:59,690
narratives that we have readily available in order to band with other grassroots organizations who are also impacted by this,

437
01:02:59,870 --> 01:03:13,339
to ultimately advocate for policies and advocate to the medical system and advocate in various different ways that these voices are heard.

438
01:03:13,340 --> 01:03:19,950
One one specific strategy was coming up with a campaign to highlight everything that

439
01:03:19,970 --> 01:03:27,320
we hear directly here every day from the women that are impacted by these issues.

440
01:03:28,250 --> 01:03:31,510
So our our we didn't quite remember.

441
01:03:31,820 --> 01:03:34,430
Okay, so you didn't have to finish the save up.

442
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:42,379
I'm interested in like, who else in this room felt like there was a low resource kind of group moneywise, right?

443
01:03:42,380 --> 01:03:48,620
So now what is the strategy that they're adopting as a grassroots organization that doesn't have a significant amount of funding?

444
01:03:49,010 --> 01:03:53,510
Is coalition building. Right. So you're going to figure out where your allies are.

445
01:03:53,750 --> 01:04:00,140
And I think I told the same thing to you guys over there. I think that probably also applies to a couple of the other national groups.

446
01:04:00,470 --> 01:04:02,000
You're going to think about allies ship,

447
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:08,240
who could be more champions also in the legislature might be a really good step that you could take from that.

448
01:04:09,020 --> 01:04:16,220
And especially now that you guys have a lot of evidence behind you because you did this study so you could build your strategy around.

449
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:25,100
Well, we know firsthand from women experiencing this that we have research we talked to, we're going to present their views.

450
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:27,559
That can be a powerful advocacy tool.

451
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:35,180
So your role in the coalition would be maybe to provide that perspective and make sure that I'm going to go really great through groups.

452
01:04:35,180 --> 01:04:42,710
So who's next? Basically, do you mind that we're elevens right now?

453
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:48,890
Okay. I feel like it's been good as anyone. I think it's a virtuous day, number one.

454
01:04:49,490 --> 01:04:52,370
So we were the National Birth Equity Collaborative.

455
01:04:52,370 --> 01:04:58,999
And so some of the challenges that we talked about were lack of funding and again, mistrust between patients and providers.

456
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:03,050
And we were a small organization, so it's hard for big hospitals to take us seriously.

457
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:09,229
So we decided for our model, we were attempting to obtain optimal birth resources and conditions and increase

458
01:05:09,230 --> 01:05:13,790
health equity among black people by addressing social and racial inequalities.

459
01:05:14,090 --> 01:05:20,900
And we're doing that through education to both the general public, but specifically to blacks, emails and health professionals,

460
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:25,009
and through adequate training and awareness and past stereotypes and underlying

461
01:05:25,010 --> 01:05:32,149
conditions to maintain and improve the lack of trust between patients and providers.

462
01:05:32,150 --> 01:05:36,170
So again, just doing that, maybe we were talking about collaborating with different groups.

463
01:05:36,170 --> 01:05:41,660
So collaborating with black churches, birthing centers, schools, community health centers,

464
01:05:41,690 --> 01:05:48,980
h e c news and reach out to black leaders to disseminate accurate health information and promote positive, positive health behaviors.

465
01:05:49,100 --> 01:05:53,340
Yeah, and I feel like you two groups would probably in the real world be allies, right?

466
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:56,630
That's the kind of alliance you would like. I like that.

467
01:05:56,840 --> 01:06:03,049
I think for your sound bite, that's a good starting point. And you've touched on all the right things and you're really representing your group.

468
01:06:03,050 --> 01:06:11,180
Well, probably the whole group would have to sit down more and think about what is a shorter version of that, like a public version of that.

469
01:06:11,180 --> 01:06:17,120
What you've shared here is a bit more like our position for our allies and people who already know this issue.

470
01:06:17,510 --> 01:06:24,260
Another step, which I didn't ask any of you to look at today, so it's not wrong, is how would the public react to that?

471
01:06:24,260 --> 01:06:29,120
Do you need a shorter spoken or more simplified version of exactly those values?

472
01:06:29,330 --> 01:06:36,260
And the difficult part is, the more you care specifically about each of these components, the harder it is to represent them in a soundbite.

473
01:06:36,260 --> 01:06:40,940
I think that's the challenge of this exercise to think of, plus the next piece.

474
01:06:42,350 --> 01:06:45,410
What number of genitals I saw was number 12.

475
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:48,600
Exactly. So we are taking individual action.

476
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:56,240
We are a 23 organization that's interdisciplinary in its evidence based practices for perinatal care,

477
01:06:57,350 --> 01:07:02,390
where the NPA, the National Association, are strategized.

478
01:07:02,630 --> 01:07:05,570
We can't directly lobby the Congress,

479
01:07:05,570 --> 01:07:14,720
but we talk about partnering with organizations that can lobby and to give credibility to their claims and so having support from the NPA.

480
01:07:15,470 --> 01:07:23,570
We published a lot of relevant guidelines as well as recommendations on how to push providers

481
01:07:23,570 --> 01:07:30,050
to receive training on those guidelines and recommendations that are evidence based.

482
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:36,950
And then we wanted to increase publications and relevant research in our journal to send to providers.

483
01:07:37,970 --> 01:07:45,320
Our say is that we work to ensure education and advocacy in partnership with other maternal and child support based funding.

484
01:07:46,370 --> 01:07:50,870
Yeah, so allyship and Coalition building and partnership are there for you guys,

485
01:07:50,870 --> 01:07:55,520
but a big part of what you discussed is, is information sharing, framing the issue.

486
01:07:55,790 --> 01:07:59,530
So did anybody catch that there are five on 1c3.

487
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:08,600
And so there are certain categories of organization in the tax code that limit what you can do in terms of political activity.

488
01:08:09,140 --> 01:08:14,530
They discussed this and thought that, well, a lot of what they do is actually educational, informational.

489
01:08:14,550 --> 01:08:20,390
It would be about educating their members and then working in partnership with others to share that information.

490
01:08:20,510 --> 01:08:24,860
And also, I like that you brought forward the power of your expertize, right?

491
01:08:25,190 --> 01:08:32,719
Anybody and I think to the surprise of some groups over here, anybody who's representing a medical profession might want to draw on that

492
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:36,410
expertize as a source of authority for their message and framing of the problem.

493
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:41,480
Great. Thanks. I'm going to be going to that and I hope you guys.

494
01:08:44,680 --> 01:08:53,090
Okay. So we have a senator, magnificent as Democrat from New Hampshire, and she's strongly in support of maternal health for women.

495
01:08:53,110 --> 01:09:00,700
She works to help fund Planned Parenthood, insure, you know, ongoing health for women with federal control money.

496
01:09:01,030 --> 01:09:13,370
She. She. She's also co-sponsored the Women's Health Protection Act, which protects a woman's freedom beside and helps her pregnancy, etc.

497
01:09:14,190 --> 01:09:17,729
We were talking about this. So this is an issue that she she stands up for.

498
01:09:17,730 --> 01:09:20,960
It is on her bucket list of the top ten things.

499
01:09:21,590 --> 01:09:26,990
She's a strong advocate for screening conditions in babies authorized screening.

500
01:09:27,260 --> 01:09:29,810
We would want to work with other people.

501
01:09:30,380 --> 01:09:40,810
I think there was a bill that was with Senator Cassidy which got off the ground, and I think he's maybe put his foot in his mouth a little bit.

502
01:09:40,820 --> 01:09:46,740
But once you can build community coalitions with other interest groups to push for greater access to education,

503
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:52,940
because we identify him specifically because he's a physician, he's shown an interest in this before.

504
01:09:53,240 --> 01:09:56,450
And also he's in the hot spot. Right. He he put his foot in his mouth.

505
01:09:56,450 --> 01:10:00,920
And I think he said some things like we only have a problem with maternal health if you count black people.

506
01:10:01,220 --> 01:10:04,490
Yeah. So that I think can be problematic.

507
01:10:04,580 --> 01:10:08,540
Yeah. So he's in the hot seat and I think, you know, he needs a lifeline.

508
01:10:08,810 --> 01:10:14,330
So I think partnering with them on some legislation to improve maternal health

509
01:10:14,330 --> 01:10:19,460
specifically for that group could help burnish his reputation a little bit.

510
01:10:19,700 --> 01:10:27,889
So that's one thing, one strategy we thought of. Great partnering with other members of Congress also is the strategy that we

511
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:34,910
have that she's taken and she's partnered with a number of others in the past.

512
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:43,819
But we're just looking for who our other allies were. Richard Blumenthal, Kamala Harris, and obviously Ben Cardin.

513
01:10:43,820 --> 01:10:47,200
Cory Booker. Kirsten Gillibrand. Kirsten Gillibrand.

514
01:10:47,220 --> 01:10:50,300
Sorry. Yep. So you guys really are job.

515
01:10:50,450 --> 01:10:54,130
I'm going to move on because I do want to. Yeah, that's okay. I want to make sure I cover mostly.

516
01:10:54,350 --> 01:10:59,690
But what I liked about this, you kind of get into grips with that.

517
01:10:59,690 --> 01:11:04,339
Okay. I've got to figure out my own interests and elected representatives.

518
01:11:04,340 --> 01:11:11,600
And I think if I could take this same issue and also you guys down in front representing the Texan legislators,

519
01:11:12,470 --> 01:11:18,860
you know, you got to think about your own interests and your own bottom line and how do you approach the other side?

520
01:11:18,860 --> 01:11:22,730
Because in order to get something passed, you've got to have quiet partizans among them.

521
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:28,340
So unless you've gerrymandered the heck out of legislative, so much of that's not necessary.

522
01:11:28,700 --> 01:11:37,429
I think it a great job for you all. So my challenge to you guys, you had the hardest you had the hardest job here of most groups.

523
01:11:37,430 --> 01:11:40,560
I think they represent the other side. You represent Hispanics.

524
01:11:41,660 --> 01:11:44,290
So what did you guys come up with? Yeah.

525
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:50,150
So we we're Senator Bill Cassidy and they kind of for us, the part I would like to point out that the views of said itself,

526
01:11:50,150 --> 01:11:57,470
Bill Cassidy, are not represented by any of the nice people. Yes, they do, but it is quite rare.

527
01:11:57,500 --> 01:12:02,870
Okay. Yeah. So we are a conservative Republican senator from Louisiana and he does have a background as a physician,

528
01:12:02,870 --> 01:12:07,010
which is kind of interesting to see how his political views and his background conflict.

529
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:15,049
So yeah, the resources guy who handles the knowledge and skills of a senator and a physician and he also has a net worth of millions of dollars,

530
01:12:15,050 --> 01:12:18,800
as all senators do. And he was also a medical school professor.

531
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:24,590
So he's always held these influential positions of our relationship with other groups.

532
01:12:24,590 --> 01:12:31,950
You looked at some allies, Republicans, of course, conservatives and some Democrats, including Maggie Hassan, who they all signed the bill with.

533
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:40,280
So tell me about what your say statement would be. Did you get that for guys like what would be your message?

534
01:12:40,280 --> 01:12:44,750
Because he said some stupid things he's referring to here.

535
01:12:44,780 --> 01:12:50,329
So you could say some stupid things. The media picked up on that and we didn't get to the same part, but we have an idea of what it was.

536
01:12:50,330 --> 01:12:56,510
So we didn't do a lot of cleanup or tried to do some clean up or with the Research Endowment Revitalization Act,

537
01:12:56,930 --> 01:13:03,370
because he did have a quote that said to eliminate from and address the problem of maternal mortality.

538
01:13:03,380 --> 01:13:09,470
He said basically eliminate racial disparities in all health outcomes by especially among those in the perinatal stage.

539
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:11,870
So he's focused on that time before,

540
01:13:12,050 --> 01:13:20,600
directly before and after birth because he didn't have a view where he stated like maternal mortality definition like a year after,

541
01:13:20,870 --> 01:13:25,910
and that could include people who are killed by their boyfriends or something like that.

542
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:33,379
And then yeah, so not the distinction there between this is a Republican supporting this issue,

543
01:13:33,380 --> 01:13:37,240
but doing it in a very different way than maybe a Democratic senator was.

544
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:47,309
Right. And very keen on framing it the pre prior to birth, basically, which tends to be more of a conservative position.

545
01:13:47,310 --> 01:13:50,510
There's much more focus on prior to birth than off the bus.

546
01:13:50,930 --> 01:13:54,880
And we will discuss this more in this class. Could you pass the mic on for us?

547
01:13:55,460 --> 01:13:59,260
So are you going to try and graphically represent you against the.

548
01:13:59,300 --> 01:14:03,440
We are the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and.

549
01:14:03,550 --> 01:14:07,960
So we're basically a professional group of providers who aim to advocate,

550
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:13,990
educate and promote women's health that is patient centered and addresses the disparities in maternal health care.

551
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:25,240
Our strategy since we are a group of providers, we would like to attend state lobbying days at the Capitol to try to use our expertize in that way,

552
01:14:25,570 --> 01:14:28,719
as well as educational materials for patients.

553
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:31,900
And we do fund research for our providers as well.

554
01:14:32,380 --> 01:14:34,480
As well as a lot of women's health research,

555
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:42,100
we think that's really important to keep it modern and to keep it funded as well as we provide direct financial support.

556
01:14:42,460 --> 01:14:54,790
Since we are a PAC and so there's a lot of ways that we are able to fund certainly senators for theirs and to sway policy in that way.

557
01:14:54,790 --> 01:15:03,450
So that was our strategy there. However, we did mention with you how a lot of providers do tend to be more on the right wing.

558
01:15:03,460 --> 01:15:11,080
So that was something that with our educational material that we've been putting out to try to sway our providers in that way,

559
01:15:11,530 --> 01:15:15,910
and since they oftentimes see the firsthand effects of maternal mortality.

560
01:15:16,300 --> 01:15:23,379
Yeah. And so you as a group, we talked about this probably would not be would be very supportive of a lot of

561
01:15:23,380 --> 01:15:27,010
the measures that have been put forward to try and address maternal mortality,

562
01:15:28,330 --> 01:15:33,069
slightly distinct from physicians as a group who do tend more to be Republican and conservative.

563
01:15:33,070 --> 01:15:36,100
So keep that in mind for some of the other groups.

564
01:15:36,370 --> 01:15:39,279
And I said, if I ask you to be the American Medical Association,

565
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:43,599
you would have had a fighting card in your book, somewhat in your talk, which I quite like.

566
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:48,610
That was good. There's like seven.

567
01:15:49,690 --> 01:15:54,400
We had a representative from the area. I think that's why you see, I was saying I do not know.

568
01:15:54,430 --> 01:15:58,330
I just read a lot about her. And, you know, what do you believe when talking about resources?

569
01:15:59,260 --> 01:16:02,020
She serves as a representative in the House.

570
01:16:02,020 --> 01:16:09,130
She's Democrat of Texas, and she has a really, really strong background in tackling health disparities and maternal mortality in Texas.

571
01:16:10,180 --> 01:16:15,280
So to tackle this issue, we know that Texas is a majority Republican state.

572
01:16:16,750 --> 01:16:21,340
So I think residing within a conservative state will force our representatives to kind of

573
01:16:21,340 --> 01:16:27,459
respect their argument and cater to conservative family values to gain their support.

574
01:16:27,460 --> 01:16:31,390
So such as like Christianity for life, etc.

575
01:16:31,750 --> 01:16:39,729
And also she could also collaborate with like during the another pro-choice organizations because there are things that like accessible,

576
01:16:39,730 --> 01:16:45,100
safe abortions and they also have a lot of background in decreasing maternal mortality as well.

577
01:16:46,030 --> 01:16:50,409
So Representative Sharon, she definitely understands that, you know,

578
01:16:50,410 --> 01:16:57,600
tackling maternal mortality is at the heart of preserving Texas dedication and Christian values.

579
01:16:57,760 --> 01:17:02,739
Oh, I quite like that. So you're trying to find a compromise position.

580
01:17:02,740 --> 01:17:08,620
You got to compromise with all the people in the legislature. Unfortunately, this group, because they're also running essentially someone from Texas.

581
01:17:09,700 --> 01:17:16,870
And you're thinking about framing this in terms of religious or family values in that context, which could be very appropriate to do.

582
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:24,459
At the same time, though, you mentioned some folks who are supporters and probably donors to her campaign funds.

583
01:17:24,460 --> 01:17:30,460
That might take a slightly different position. So you wouldn't have to work with those allies to make sure they have more in common with you, right?

584
01:17:30,620 --> 01:17:41,700
Yeah. So that would be the challenge because we get the other side of the Texans debate and yeah, that'll be our Senator Lewis.

585
01:17:42,130 --> 01:17:45,240
Of course, I don't understand the writing process.

586
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:49,930
Okay. So she is a Republican state senator in Texas.

587
01:17:50,540 --> 01:17:54,550
She is the chair of the Senate Committee for Propaganda Purposes.

588
01:17:55,300 --> 01:18:00,120
And she is involved in a lot of things that have to do with your homework quality.

589
01:18:01,030 --> 01:18:05,559
And so she was one of the leaders of support for the bill to extend Medicaid

590
01:18:05,560 --> 01:18:11,950
coverage after pregnancy and from the federal role and extending it to six months.

591
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:19,990
However, she got a lot of pushback from groups and news organizations saying that it should be extended to 12 months.

592
01:18:19,990 --> 01:18:26,590
But she wants everyone to know that she's doing a great service by extending to six months and that should be sufficient for everyone.

593
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:37,230
So she also was a part of getting the text eventually turned out to be a good thing when Humanity Committee passed,

594
01:18:37,240 --> 01:18:42,520
which is pregnancy related deaths and trying to understand that so that a lot

595
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:46,820
of the action items are going to be around gathering data for this community,

596
01:18:47,560 --> 01:18:50,590
you know, making sure that this continues to be funded,

597
01:18:50,590 --> 01:18:56,500
as well as implementing policies between the providers, because she talks a lot about the hospital systems.

598
01:18:57,130 --> 01:19:03,060
And so was it. I would be cynical about this. Right. So she wants to see more data.

599
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:06,759
A review of voter mission, which we went to war.

600
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:16,660
So is a consensus position. But part of what was on my mind is the Texans that I was referring to the data, which later turned out to be wrong.

601
01:19:17,470 --> 01:19:22,180
They say that was the worst place in the United States for the central time.

602
01:19:22,460 --> 01:19:26,260
So I think part of that motivation was subsequent to that.

603
01:19:28,690 --> 01:19:35,499
Thank you. And thanks. So you're off. This is an interesting example, again, of some of these moments.

604
01:19:35,500 --> 01:19:42,489
Evans If someone reads a Republican legislator who wants to act on this issue, but I know the corrections are watering down things,

605
01:19:42,490 --> 01:19:48,190
but things on the other side and trying to find a compromise position, you keep advancing someone's right.

606
01:19:48,610 --> 01:19:54,970
I mean, not sweeping the room. I think I'll try to think when we were the Texas Medical Association, just slide nine.

607
01:19:56,410 --> 01:19:59,229
So because we're just a group of physicians,

608
01:19:59,230 --> 01:20:08,049
most of what we focus on was educating our physician group and the community on safe practices, both for pregnancy,

609
01:20:08,050 --> 01:20:10,150
prenatal practices and postpartum,

610
01:20:10,420 --> 01:20:17,940
and removing the barriers to that education so that all physicians know how to give quality maternal care and also getting physicians.

611
01:20:17,950 --> 01:20:20,500
Our actions would be to get physicians and the community involved,

612
01:20:20,890 --> 01:20:29,620
and they're contacting their elected officials about increasing accessibility and affordability of medical care for mothers.

613
01:20:29,980 --> 01:20:31,780
Our say let's make motherhood safe.

614
01:20:32,890 --> 01:20:39,670
Sean Sweet We actually took a website that's heading up there of the top of their advocacy page for Mama Mortality.

615
01:20:40,490 --> 01:20:50,350
Think what some say. I think probably because the rate of mortality for mothers is so high in Texas, it's one of the highest states.

616
01:20:50,980 --> 01:20:54,040
So it's it's by saying make motherhood safe.

617
01:20:54,040 --> 01:20:59,010
It's pointing out that it's not safe right now and that's kind of a problem.

618
01:20:59,020 --> 01:21:05,770
So I think it really points out in a very short phrase that right now this is not a safe thing and it shouldn't be.

619
01:21:06,160 --> 01:21:11,170
And I think it's also, as other physician representative groups were doing, relying on expertize.

620
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:19,750
So you tend to find these groups giving holding hearings, people giving testimony, as well as committee memberships and with testimony and again,

621
01:21:19,750 --> 01:21:27,700
probably saying might not work, but they try to that has symbolic power in their decisions as well.

622
01:21:27,930 --> 01:21:32,409
Right. Thank you, everyone, for bearing the fact that we got the policy.

623
01:21:32,410 --> 01:21:38,410
So in a minute, the thing to take away from this one overall, these are skills that you practice.

624
01:21:38,410 --> 01:21:42,100
So for the first time, some of you might be more experienced in thinking this way.

625
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:49,510
It's going to feed into all the assignments going forward. So when you get a new challenge or I'm asking you to come up with a new policy solution,

626
01:21:49,510 --> 01:21:56,650
especially for a policy then trying to do this exercise of thinking through these four stages, get to know this group a bit more.

627
01:21:56,950 --> 01:22:02,380
And this is exactly what you've seen in the strategic paper, which is the first assignment.

628
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:15,550
Otherwise go in peace. Thanks for staying a couple of minutes like I would see and I think really we're just working so hard today.

629
01:22:17,380 --> 01:22:33,300
See you later. But I just heard made.
