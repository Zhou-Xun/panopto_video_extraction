1
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:11,060
This year, and I was super impressed with the actors at the school and where I play tennis.

2
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:18,550
Yes. With all these conflicting results, how did your wife try to.

3
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,020
Because you have your families.

4
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:28,420
Yeah, I know. I did.

5
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,720
Everybody have a nice break from. Right.

6
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:12,379
The. The. Does this paper make up?

7
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:19,750
Do the same day as the Arlene or not? Okay.

8
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:35,050
So you guys get a little buffer. So when I and the other class, there's always something with canvas, I think, because it's like.

9
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:40,920
It's like smart enough. It like pulls information from different places and sort of is like a hangover.

10
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:47,459
So there was a wrong date on like the due date for that paper and they were like, We're just checking.

11
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:51,100
And I'm like, Oh, yes, I know. We have this like.

12
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:57,570
So I was like, right in three places and wrong in one place.

13
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,560
Oh, my goodness. Let's see.

14
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:06,790
Oh, you know what? I'll just have quit. Chicken.

15
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,540
So I figured we can.

16
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:18,040
Yeah. And then we. I just kind of offered these weeks.

17
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:22,590
So that might be about as much time for hesitation. Reasonable.

18
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:32,380
So that we can always break early. And then you want to touch base about labor during the rest of that time.

19
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:36,710
And. I mean, do you have time?

20
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:41,590
Yeah. I mean, yeah, that would be. Yeah, my.

21
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:50,900
Yeah. Everybody's like, Oh, yeah, we got to pay. So.

22
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:58,760
Yeah, next. Well, I can meet, but I think my day.

23
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,420
I might be remote right now, but that's fine.

24
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:10,390
Yeah. I wait.

25
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:44,890
We? Are only there for just a moment.

26
00:03:44,910 --> 00:04:03,710
Just. Anytime between.

27
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:14,180
Let. Great.

28
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:22,880
Yeah. Let's do a stupid one, but I'll send you.

29
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,320
Okay. For how much? 30 minutes.

30
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:32,570
Yeah, yeah. 30 minutes and half an hour. Okay, I'll reserve.

31
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:54,980
What is going to happen to her? Michael.

32
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,590
Like a spare moment. Think about it.

33
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:28,580
Christy and I are friends as we're trying to redo the bridge, trying to put some structure around that tiny piece.

34
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:38,910
I don't know if you guys have. Feel free to email me later,

35
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:47,489
but about what we think and feeling I feel like I'm waiting for between like having people do something

36
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:53,280
that works for them and that's like saying there's the structure and I feel like I might start to say,

37
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:59,600
Here's the structure just because then everybody can share. Here is an incredible transcript.

38
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:06,060
But some people have taken the word.

39
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,900
You know. The table format.

40
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:20,430
Trump. I thought about it and I was just like, I knew.

41
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:29,110
You were with me when this people like you forced me to be more like smart oriented.

42
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:35,010
I do think especially. Have you.

43
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:44,060
Template, a partizan fight. I spent a lot of time with the town.

44
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:52,390
People work, so. Yeah.

45
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,070
Yeah, okay. I mean, that's my place in my heart.

46
00:06:55,070 --> 00:07:05,500
And I think it's kind of also just working around some training grounds, putting together a campaign that's for nine year olds.

47
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:10,000
That could be. People.

48
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:16,410
Hey, I need to do this right.

49
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:23,320
Oh, I think it is actually more. Yeah.

50
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:28,650
Nothing. Yeah.

51
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:32,470
We were just talking about. I mean, he is not.

52
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:40,930
The entire summer spent working on something I recommended for my family.

53
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:45,910
So. And I did that. That little program.

54
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:51,820
Yeah, right. What would you recommend? I mean, I know you're just giving it to your son.

55
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:56,050
I think it was a little tiny is the one.

56
00:07:56,150 --> 00:08:03,660
Do it. But at the end. These come out in the end, which is useful.

57
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:07,160
But I think there's a way to do. She had been.

58
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:14,290
Because the ratings system sometimes not at all very much.

59
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:22,570
You can get a call five. He said it would have been something the ratings.

60
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:32,580
Nuts. Yeah. So I'm wondering if maybe there might be a hybrid thing right when you start to go through that.

61
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:38,280
Because I what I like about that program for that, I mean, that kind of takes you through.

62
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:44,420
Thinking about, like what tone for what I like.

63
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:52,910
I don't want to be here, but you know, like, I think for beer it's a little bit less like during my youth, but.

64
00:08:54,080 --> 00:09:01,930
But that could be a good thing, too. To put some of those.

65
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:09,070
If you open a traditional paper.

66
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:14,509
Those questions. I don't think he. This came from that.

67
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:20,220
But there's this book called. It is my version of this, like a career development and it has a.

68
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:27,230
Those are two. The biggest pool that.

69
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:38,750
Let me get this off. I think it's just like coming into the space program, like people tend to have a lot of great experiences.

70
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:46,010
So having those questions in a way that maybe there are others that many people go.

71
00:09:47,090 --> 00:10:04,450
Anything from Sarah Palin that. And then the only other thing I think is sort of can be the bias against the first paragraph is that.

72
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:17,880
Who am I here? It's like that paragraph because I think it's good to start because you just have to do that over and over again.

73
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:25,060
Okay. What about my dad? What? Which is the difference between.

74
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:34,320
Revealed the bio sketch. I think that.

75
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:44,620
Many people think that both of them are helpful because the bios get off from easy to remember everything.

76
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:48,940
You better forget sometimes because they kind of like the last thing you done.

77
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:54,280
But actually, given that, I feel like I like it and I don't know if you guys understand.

78
00:10:54,280 --> 00:11:02,740
I think that we find it helpful in the beginning because also as you get older classes of people, you guys are all.

79
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:12,910
Your life emerging out of whatever you just did. It's it's kind of a good opportunity to just dump it all to to talk him out of it.

80
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,660
Like you said, you have it. And then you can start to think about, okay, this is like my living document.

81
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:23,890
The best thing you can. My bias.

82
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:35,990
Oh, my. Peter.

83
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:45,510
Don't reeling like that kind of information, you know, like an initial paragraph.

84
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:50,350
Yeah. I guess I could float around a little bit.

85
00:11:52,920 --> 00:12:05,970
And I think you. That might be nice to.

86
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,650
I can do stuff, especially if they have to.

87
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:21,060
Answering the questions after thinking about where we are, where we are for a couple of weeks, and then think about where.

88
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:26,470
And don't think and I think like some of the sessions that are being.

89
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:42,520
Some of the sessions, there were a wink, wink, wink to try to do something practical about practical things.

90
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:51,300
Think those might be good to go, but we're doing the assignment.

91
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:02,620
They're trying to sell. Okay.

92
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:12,190
So today we're going to hear from Kwame and and that's all the time about some of the same that can make.

93
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:19,590
You keep. Arsene Wenger.

94
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:26,580
Where would they go? And then let's make apologies.

95
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:36,020
Pretty. So let me turn on the thing.

96
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:44,130
And you can let us know, like how you want to do questions.

97
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:48,730
Do you want to just pull up? Yes.

98
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Slides on here so I can. I'll go for them.

99
00:13:52,040 --> 00:14:14,110
They're easier to see. And so for all of us, that's like science.

100
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:21,730
I mean, feel free to close the door. Sometimes we can just sort of be some whatever.

101
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:29,690
It was helpful for part of the conference.

102
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:23,610
It was really helpful. Oh, good. Because coming from none outside of UMass, like, yeah, this is where I looked at the course information.

103
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:33,980
Yeah, I think I'm glad that I feel like that's certainly the discussion that sometimes like when people know you guys are taking 600.

104
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:39,230
But. Just like during the course, they said, Wait a minute.

105
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:48,350
Oh. And so I had to hang onto those prior training and stuff that may or may not have that coverage because over 600.

106
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:57,180
She does come and talk to. 600 to. So I think at least one here and there's people or something like something, you know,

107
00:15:57,190 --> 00:16:00,490
I mean, you can imagine this is not only talking exactly about the same story, but.

108
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:06,440
I think it's good that she. It's good to do some good on the radar.

109
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:21,070
Yeah. And the fact that, like, the student session was around a little bit here, the prelim session.

110
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:36,750
Also, floods are normal, but that doesn't seem to. I think it's like it's nice to have personalities and also for us to make jokes.

111
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:48,550
Many years from now. But later.

112
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:58,740
You guys both. Just gathering.

113
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:10,880
Questions for the. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

114
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:27,080
I totally agree that you are like. And that's the only other thing.

115
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:33,810
Of course. I wish he'd stuck to his own evaluation.

116
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:45,480
The two of us. Just a random brainstorm I always was brainstorming about.

117
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:55,170
More coverage of the going to. This course does have.

118
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,270
I'm. But.

119
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:23,940
Look at it for about. More about social science, social media information, stuff like that, that Twitter.

120
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:32,490
I really like. Twitter is different now.

121
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:52,970
Matt Martinez. Who is Justin in?

122
00:18:53,710 --> 00:19:02,890
Yeah. Oh. This made sad.

123
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:11,150
And so when he does okay here. A.

124
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,660
Okay. Yeah.

125
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:32,659
Um, I am presenting today on my research about cultural competency in health and the role that culture and anti-racism in health plays in communities,

126
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:41,480
engagement with health care systems. And so as I'm going through the same questions for the NRF, you have something to ask about a specific slide.

127
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:51,470
Go ahead and interrupt me and ask. Is this just like a brief overview of everything I'm going to cover?

128
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:53,479
So the introduction,

129
00:19:53,480 --> 00:20:03,920
I think I'm showing you all this iceberg picture before the kind of requisite health and talking about cultural competency in health care systems.

130
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:10,430
It's really important that communities have a level of trust with providers in order to

131
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:16,669
engage in a healthy manner with the health care system and increase cultural understanding.

132
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:21,080
And the entire system could really help to build that trust and increase engagement.

133
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:25,040
And so training centering around physical competency are really crucial to

134
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:29,360
strengthening these relationships between community members and health care providers.

135
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:38,179
And I really like this iceberg because this aspect of culture kind of shows maybe what providers experience as they're in a community.

136
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:44,749
And I think sometimes people can think once you're in a community experiencing it, that's how you learn.

137
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:47,540
And you get to know a culture and you get to know the environment.

138
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:57,199
But there's so much that goes on underneath the surface that really involves constant action and being engaged in learning about a culture,

139
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:02,900
if you're outside of it, to really get to understand and engage with the culture outside of.

140
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:13,650
There's identified two main problems that I want to focus on. The first is that providers who are uninformed about the community where they are,

141
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:20,190
run the risk of providing culturally insensitive care, and that reduces trust between the providers and the community members.

142
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:25,649
And then problem number two is that reducing stress really leads to a decrease in engagement with the

143
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:32,580
health care system and an increase in health problems because of a lack of adherence to the CMO plans,

144
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:43,889
because of that mistrust. So my main objectives is to one understand community needs as they relate to culturally competent care and

145
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:49,770
to assess the most productive ways to provide culturally competent training to health care providers.

146
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:59,120
And so I conducted a literature review and kind of divided that literature into three main sections,

147
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:05,000
the first being the psychosocial model of racial stress in Selma to really isolate

148
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:11,990
the pathway that those types of stress and discrimination have on physical health.

149
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:20,299
The second portion of a literature review really focused in on communities of color and their engagement with health care systems at a baseline.

150
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:28,070
Because at a general level and how aspects of racism and discrimination impact the relationships between the providers and the community.

151
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,990
And then lastly,

152
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:39,440
I took a look at culturally competent health care frameworks that are currently in existence and the suggestions that the literature provides.

153
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:47,870
And I'll go over a few of those frameworks now. So the first theoretical framework really focuses on communication.

154
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:52,070
It looks at an increase of cultural competence through a provider.

155
00:22:52,340 --> 00:23:03,980
Discussing with an individual in a doctor's appointment or any type of clinical setting relies on nonverbal skills, verbal behavior skills,

156
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:11,030
a recognition of the potential cultural differences and incorporating the cultural knowledge that the provider already has,

157
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:20,030
as well as negotiations and collaborations between the provider and the individual in the appointment to come to a mutual understanding.

158
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:26,059
And this really does a great job of examining cultural competency at an individual

159
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:32,900
level in those appointments or sessions between a provider and a community member.

160
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:39,980
However, it is difficult. I don't know if you all had a doctor's appointment, how kind of been embraced in an hour.

161
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:49,130
You don't have a lot of time to talk to your provider and to really get the opportunity to provide that cultural understanding.

162
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:58,190
It also put a lot of the work on the community member to provide that cultural understanding for the provider and assume that

163
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:08,059
each individual makes up the assumptions of the whole and that the experiences of each individual community member is the same,

164
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:13,490
basically. And so it's a good starting place, but the literature continued to build on it.

165
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:22,040
And so the second framework looks at provider cultural sensitivity as a whole and how it impacts the testing provider.

166
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:27,110
And that increased stress really works toward interpersonal control.

167
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:34,880
Having more control over your health, decrease in physical stress, increase satisfaction with care,

168
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:41,780
and all of those elements work together to improve healthy lifestyles and adherence to treatment plans.

169
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:49,760
And so this is a great step in the right direction. It doesn't address how the provider comes to cultural sensitivity, though.

170
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,610
It kind of assumes that the provider gets there.

171
00:24:53,030 --> 00:25:00,140
And so looking at a way to kind of engage what happens before this point and how we get to this point,

172
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:11,809
the same authors of this model developed a more drawn out model that looked at the environment that the providers in their health care setting,

173
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:19,400
the attitudes of their coworkers and supports that that administration and getting to that cultural sensitivity place.

174
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:29,329
And so, again, it looks at the increase first in provider and then all of the elements that increase control over your health, satisfaction with care.

175
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:32,959
And then this element with physical success here is not written here.

176
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:40,100
But in the articles about this model, they stress that physical stress also includes racial stress in Selma as well.

177
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:48,800
And so they're really looking at how to decrease this element here and then increase adherence to treatment plan and health promoting lifestyles.

178
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:58,250
So this is also great, but it doesn't get to how these elements of the environment increase or decrease cultural sensitivity.

179
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:07,490
And a systematic review that was conducted about various different models, the ones that I just showed,

180
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:14,240
but then also a few other ones as well, really get down to how hopefully competent health care is produced.

181
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:17,629
And it breaks it down to an organizational level.

182
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:27,980
So the more macro details of hopefully competent care and then down to the individual provider trainings for providers, human resources, support,

183
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:34,459
integration of interpreters and adaption of the physical environment that the clinic is

184
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:41,270
in and really breaks down all of the elements that make up culturally competent care.

185
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:49,340
And so for my project, I really wanted to kind of combine elements of all of these different frameworks into one.

186
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:57,420
And so this conflict. Health care failing, including the elements from the slide before of that organizational level,

187
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:03,360
but also training for providers individually ultimately to work together to increase

188
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:07,650
culturally competent providers and increase that trust in the health care system,

189
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:13,490
thus increasing the satisfaction with care and reducing both psychosocial stress.

190
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:20,939
A lot of the stressors in the framework for focus on that visit was first, but I think it's important to think about the mental,

191
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:27,300
emotional and social stressors that exist as a result of the mistrust in the health care system as well,

192
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:34,650
and how these elements work together to improve to produce improved positive health care engagement in health behaviors.

193
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:42,140
And so I hypothesize that the cultural competency is increased in health care settings.

194
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:46,670
There's a greater likelihood of communities engaging positively with providers

195
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:51,050
and adhering to treatment plans that increase medical trust and decrease stress.

196
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:56,640
So I broke that implementation into three main phases.

197
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,430
Phase one is using a community based participatory research approach to really assess the community

198
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:08,670
health care needs and the key aspects of the culture as it relates to the health of community members.

199
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:13,440
And then phase two is to work with community leaders, members, educators,

200
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:19,019
and then also health care providers to develop the culturally competent trainings for the providers and

201
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:24,810
implement those in academic and clinical settings based on the recommendations collected from Phase one.

202
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:30,030
And then lastly, phase three is to work with medical schools and health care systems to implement

203
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:33,840
these trainings to both students and professionals within the community.

204
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:41,700
And so to assess the effectiveness of this method,

205
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:49,710
I wanted to start with qualitative methods using the CBP to conduct focus groups to inform the surveys,

206
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:54,959
asking community stakeholders and members about one their health care needs,

207
00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:03,870
and into the element of culture and community that they think are crucial in understanding the health needs of their community and

208
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:11,430
develop initial planning materials based on the qualitative analysis of that data collected and both the focus groups and the surveys.

209
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:16,860
And then after developing the training and implementing the innovation,

210
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:22,340
conducting a longitudinal study in the community that matter that measures one satisfaction that the

211
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:28,140
health care provided before the intervention and then at milestones after an intervention is introduced,

212
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:37,680
measuring success in providing that this is a physiological measure of stress and also a measure of racial stress as well.

213
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:44,370
And then health care behaviors of pre intervention and then pulse at the different milestones.

214
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:53,510
And so there has been evidence showing that lack of cultural currency impacts these

215
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:57,890
communities and their ability to effectively engage with the health care system.

216
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:08,120
And there's research to support cohesive, competent models of health and the training of providers to produce this culturally competent medicine.

217
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:16,040
But as of now, there is no actual formal training that exists in hospitals or medical schools to provide

218
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:23,149
this culturally competent care and properly operationalizing either the typical view about

219
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:29,930
where culturally competent health care would assist in being able to ensure that communities

220
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:37,519
have an increased sense of control over their health and trust in practitioners,

221
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:43,400
regardless of where they go, would be able to handle the health care needs of the community.

222
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:55,399
And so moving forward, I would like to assess the differences between implementing these trainings at a medical school level and then at a

223
00:30:55,400 --> 00:31:03,830
provider clinical level as well and see if there's any difference and the impact of the training at those two levels.

224
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:10,850
Also, develop a framework for culturally competent training so that replication can occur across communities in

225
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:18,080
this basic framework can be shifted and changed based on the needs of the community that's being served.

226
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:24,050
And then lastly, examine possibilities for adjusting the training to fit specific medical specialties.

227
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:32,840
Right now, I'm thinking that this is going to be focused on preventative medicine and kind of a general idea of health.

228
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:40,640
But I think that there is an argument for why culturally competent care in training is really important for specialties,

229
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:45,830
specifically specialties and OB-GYNs and cardiology.

230
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:55,129
And I put E.R. as well, although I was reading some articles that talked about emergency medicine being preventative

231
00:31:55,130 --> 00:32:01,280
medicine for a lot of communities that don't have insurance or primary care provider.

232
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:05,360
So that may be included in their initial training as well.

233
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:21,200
Thank you. My main question or one of my questions.

234
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:28,110
I didn't care because it's like, who is your community?

235
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:32,519
Is it look like Gina's here or is it somewhere else?

236
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:36,329
Like where you like to go? Yes, I would imagine.

237
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:40,440
I wasn't sure how specific we were going to go, so I didn't put it in the slide.

238
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:47,610
But if I was doing the study right now, I would focus it on really the east side of Detroit,

239
00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:52,290
mainly because that's the community I know the best there.

240
00:32:52,290 --> 00:32:56,669
And also I don't know what area of Detroit is specifically.

241
00:32:56,670 --> 00:33:00,660
I think it might be either midtown or the new center area.

242
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:05,460
Henry Ford is right there. So the hospital system is kind of within that community.

243
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:12,660
So I think it would be good to kind of focus it in where I know there's at least access to a large health

244
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:20,250
care system and working with Henry Ford and the community leaders in that area to build the training plan.

245
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:27,209
But with CPR, starting with the focus group and kind of a larger group to identify the small community,

246
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:37,020
I think I don't want to go in and select necessarily one small community until I speak to maybe like a larger group

247
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:43,800
of stakeholders and leaders in Detroit to identify what community would be the best to start this project with.

248
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:55,160
So like speaking about like the population. They're like.

249
00:33:56,430 --> 00:34:01,829
Do you see this feeling like the U.S.? Or is your interest more like making sure you have a community engagement?

250
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:06,460
Is it more engaging with like medical schools and training or what?

251
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:17,970
I see this not necessarily on a national level, maybe from healthcare system to healthcare system.

252
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:24,600
And so starting with the hospitals that are attached to a medical school or a medical training program to kind of get that

253
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:32,160
double side of implementing that feeling with medical students as well as practitioners that are at the hospital already.

254
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:42,540
And then once it gets established in that setting and developed, we develop that framework of hopefully competent care in the training program.

255
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:47,880
Moving to another health care system, probably within that same state or city first,

256
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:53,700
and then seeing how it scales another state, another state and that way.

257
00:34:53,700 --> 00:35:00,870
But I can't see the these aspects of culturally competent care working on a broad national level,

258
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:05,370
because the idea is to understand a community on an individual scale.

259
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:12,990
And I think it you generalize too much if you get too broad with the trainings and the frameworks.

260
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:22,430
Relates to a question I had in terms of like what is out there already in terms of.

261
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:31,770
And I don't know how much you delved into that, but that would be helpful to hear about in terms of like.

262
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:42,860
You know, I think we've all done trainings that for like, you know, like sort of to download or to picture whatever you and,

263
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:49,850
you know, in terms of this combination of this kind of run on a whole population in general, what.

264
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:56,760
In terms of training. It's going to be trained before. What's been going on now?

265
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:02,950
So far what I've seen it and I'm still working to comb through.

266
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:11,530
There's a lot more literature and if you get very specific about different populations or disabilities or things like that,

267
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:13,689
you can find more specific trainings.

268
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:21,819
But on a broad level it's more focused on DIY and being accepting of differences and understanding that people have

269
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:31,450
differences and not necessarily tailoring medical training to include aspects of culture that may impact health.

270
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:36,910
There's some public health. Some medical schools now have included some courses and things like that because

271
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:40,600
they've found that more students are interested in those aspects of health.

272
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:48,430
So there including some courses, but nothing is mandatory and nothing is kind of set as a standard yet across the board,

273
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:57,310
especially at larger medical schools, some smaller ones and some HBCU have those programs in place, but a lot of them are opt in.

274
00:36:57,490 --> 00:37:02,889
After you get into med school, you can, if you're really interested in community health, things like that.

275
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:07,420
But I haven't found anything yet, but I think maybe if I switch.

276
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:15,380
The articles I've been searching, I've been on pub met a little bit. But maybe if I switch to some more medical journals and see.

277
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:21,840
What's happening at a medical school level indicates the curriculum that might be useful.

278
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:28,349
I'm thinking as I'm expanding on the literature reviews, but so far I haven't found anything that goes dives deeper.

279
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:37,470
Paddy I encourage a broad understanding and a more cultural humility and cultural sensitivity that cultural competency.

280
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:42,300
My sister said she's been at school in Syracuse.

281
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:49,000
Yeah, all the public health stuff with like optional like dude, eventually she did an MPH for a session.

282
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:58,050
Very grateful that you take what she said. She doesn't get any of the cultural sensitivity stuff, like it was one seminar or something.

283
00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:03,360
So I was just thinking in terms of your qualitative, I don't remember if you included,

284
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:08,960
like in your community, do qualitative stuff with the students or Oh no, I did.

285
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,560
I can tell you what they got. Yeah. Community and how they think they would.

286
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:21,900
Yeah. Yeah, I am. That's funny, because Syracuse does have a very, very strong black community.

287
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:25,649
My friend at law school there. And so I used to stay up with her.

288
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:32,490
And it was so funny going from campus to leaving and going to there's this really nice student apartment, which is kind of foreign.

289
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:36,389
So you have to drive through that many communities in Syracuse to get there.

290
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:46,980
And the differences between the campus and the neighborhoods in Syracuse are so extreme increasing that they don't dive deeper into the community,

291
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:57,140
that they're like right in the middle. Yeah, that was another question I had to in terms of like, who's your population?

292
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:06,760
Few years, but also. Who are the stakeholders in their population?

293
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:12,780
Anyone who has to train in Houston, it's wherever but Syracuse.

294
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:21,250
But like, who would? Kind of the key roles that you would have to engage Anderson in the car.

295
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:31,680
And I do think actually that's. Medical educator, responsible people being important this year.

296
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:42,290
And I it don't like you know I kind of that I'm in phase two but you're saying a bit phase one I should include kind

297
00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:50,120
of basic caters and medical students and things here as well while we're doing the surveys and the focus groups.

298
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:57,220
It could be helpful because just also thinking about like phases two and three,

299
00:39:58,450 --> 00:40:04,779
you certainly need to be engaging with that by if they are feeling like,

300
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:12,910
oh, well, we've done it like we've had our seminar or we've done this, whatever it is, it would be interesting to get their perspective on.

301
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:20,010
This has been addressed like so many ways that you guys are addressing that sooner.

302
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:24,730
You know, why are we not what are the costs and benefits of this?

303
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:30,489
Yeah, there was also another element.

304
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:39,970
I wasn't sure where to put this, but I do know that sometimes there's medical systems or medical schools that are aware of these things.

305
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:49,780
But because the overall consensus is that providers have bias and they're not aware and not hopefully competent, that mistrust is still there.

306
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:57,400
So developing some sort of element that if they do have those elements already built in for whatever community they're serving,

307
00:40:57,620 --> 00:41:04,989
a way to show that to the broader base so that they can build that trust and have people engage with their system more.

308
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:11,140
Because if people don't know that the feelings of these providers group the feelings of the,

309
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:15,970
you know, role providers all over what they assume to be, then they're not going to go.

310
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:23,949
So does it really matter to figure out a way to bridge that gap and have providers engage?

311
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:29,319
And so I don't know if I would include that in maybe an aspect of the focus group.

312
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,240
Ask what their assumptions,

313
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:39,220
ask assumptions basically about the health care system and how they feel about the providers ready to get a feeling of that.

314
00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:46,389
And maybe in the second phase, in addition to providing the training for providers,

315
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:54,700
also providing literature or a campaign or some sort of posters for community members to show that this work is happening and going on.

316
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:05,570
Essentially there are already rules in place. One. Providers like you can use that.

317
00:42:07,170 --> 00:42:11,580
Providers is the health. I have to worry about bias and like.

318
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:18,430
When expanding the population. Access to medical care.

319
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:23,550
Pharmaceuticals. You are interested? Earlier on.

320
00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:33,620
That's what you hear about. Same. Let's take it back.

321
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:37,320
Yeah. Yeah, right. And haven't really been paying the rent.

322
00:42:37,350 --> 00:42:42,089
So I was thinking to like if they're models, I'd like to buy.

323
00:42:42,090 --> 00:42:48,180
You went through the models and pointed out the gaps, but I think that was.

324
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:55,149
Well, maybe it was just this one time just thinking about like maybe you were as you were talking.

325
00:42:55,150 --> 00:43:03,310
And you're saying, like in the visit, the same people are coming to visit their surroundings around.

326
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:07,410
Like I appreciated that you were saying that you have to get outside the business.

327
00:43:09,310 --> 00:43:14,080
I think in some ways, to me, I've seen more fairness. In both directions.

328
00:43:14,330 --> 00:43:20,190
Yeah, because even if we're talking about the emergency room being the primary source of care,

329
00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:27,269
they don't have time in an emergency room to go through all of these, communicate and talk and all that.

330
00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:37,049
So, yeah, having the providers do that work ahead of time and come in with that cultural knowledge, I think is really one speed up the process too.

331
00:43:37,050 --> 00:43:45,360
I did see some articles coming at this at more of a financial and business approach and how it would save hospitals money.

332
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:49,860
And it's better for business to be culturally competent. So that was interesting to Skinner.

333
00:43:50,660 --> 00:44:01,410
Yeah, that's always like somebody that's different, which but it also made me think to look,

334
00:44:01,410 --> 00:44:05,660
I think I was really musing on as we're talking this question of like what Ernie

335
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:12,990
earnings it seems like it would be helpful certainly for your like research.

336
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:19,700
Practically for your research. But also even like in a live review or something, know.

337
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:29,220
What what type of medical education programing in this space does exist.

338
00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:34,470
But it seems like by really homing in on that,

339
00:44:34,490 --> 00:44:41,180
being able to say because I think you said you looked around a little bit and not super systematically yet,

340
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:51,230
but that seems like a place where it could be really important and helpful and you could be like, I'm going to let the neighbors contribution because.

341
00:44:53,140 --> 00:45:01,090
It just feels like there could be like a way to organize that when you you know, by saying, you know some places offer.

342
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:05,270
Some courses might. You can take them or not every time.

343
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:14,419
Some places offer, you know, one. Suppose in a seminar that's required, but it's really short someplace places sounds like great job training,

344
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:21,520
but if there's a way to classify these different approaches with regard to this issue,

345
00:45:21,530 --> 00:45:31,189
in that context, it seems like it would be really helpful to know that I'm meeting with Katie tomorrow, actually, so include that in there.

346
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:35,450
Ask her about it. I think it seems like it would be harder to find a little bit,

347
00:45:35,450 --> 00:45:43,969
but so far I've been focused on ideas about social competency and understanding it in these different frameworks and models.

348
00:45:43,970 --> 00:45:51,440
But I haven't looked at the different schools that actually do have programs because they weren't this kind of like laid out.

349
00:45:51,590 --> 00:45:56,090
But I guess there is some validity in understanding the impact that that has already,

350
00:45:56,090 --> 00:46:03,760
because that also provides support on why more schools should adopt this and why it should be kind of fleshed out more there.

351
00:46:03,890 --> 00:46:11,540
If it's working for these schools and these are the students that take this class versus the students that don't their idea value.

352
00:46:12,350 --> 00:46:16,550
Right. Right. And because you have if you go to your model.

353
00:46:21,190 --> 00:46:28,630
Yeah. And thinking about, you know how ultimately these minds.

354
00:46:30,310 --> 00:46:38,790
We have both and kind of like developed the training but also are also providing we all of those different pieces.

355
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:46,710
It's like, you know what I'm just thinking? I'm just wondering what has been done in the past really.

356
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:52,980
You know, could it be sort of like more literature in terms of.

357
00:46:54,230 --> 00:46:58,610
His hospital system did a TBI training and evaluating outcomes.

358
00:46:58,610 --> 00:47:06,710
And what difference does that make? And that seems like an important piece to kind of look in to your.

359
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:13,940
Thinking that research on this because I think. This is great.

360
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:17,660
And we all like this and have this, like more theoretical.

361
00:47:18,030 --> 00:47:22,900
Yes, this is good. This is like the applications. But going to that first box.

362
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:28,650
But it's you're saying like I understand why that first box is left out of the other theoretical models.

363
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:30,080
Yeah. Inner circle.

364
00:47:30,090 --> 00:47:41,430
You had a really hard circle to create, you know, and it's so much more that goes on right then I think that you proposed to get steps towards.

365
00:47:42,130 --> 00:47:47,290
Starting to create it. But I think also it's going to be important to sort of say, okay,

366
00:47:47,510 --> 00:47:53,530
what are people trying to pawn in this like trading space again, just like they're all done these trainings,

367
00:47:53,530 --> 00:48:00,339
like summer grades or whatever, and then the videos and case examples and you know,

368
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:03,430
like the TEDx talk about your show feels like a powerful way to illustrate it.

369
00:48:03,910 --> 00:48:09,130
So how were the people trying? You know, it also makes me wonder.

370
00:48:11,230 --> 00:48:15,430
Give it to your music on, I guess. But, like, if you just.

371
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:21,319
If you do some of that research and say like, oh, gosh, people tend to say, okay,

372
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:27,270
the entire University of Michigan needs to do this PowerPoint presentation about that a lot.

373
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:30,400
We'll take 10 minutes and you can watch that fast speed.

374
00:48:31,290 --> 00:48:39,529
You know, like that's cheap and easy. But then like, is this has that ever been evaluated?

375
00:48:39,530 --> 00:48:48,079
What do we know about that, whether it's shortcomings? And then if you find all that stuff out, which is a big task.

376
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:51,830
But I think that could be really cool. Yeah, and it could be like that, really.

377
00:48:52,430 --> 00:49:00,920
Like any contribution. Then you could say, okay, like I put in my opinion training, whatever.

378
00:49:01,010 --> 00:49:11,780
I want to go to that training and the next thing to like make trainings that are better then oh, interesting communication strategies or.

379
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:23,620
Something. I don't know what that might be. Communication, sticky communication, or those kinds of classes that could help with that.

380
00:49:24,430 --> 00:49:30,310
Creating good materials in a way that does. Could be interesting to consider.

381
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:39,850
Next semester, I'm taking one of my cognate classes in the sociology of health and health care workers or something like that,

382
00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:48,250
and it looks at how individuals engage with health care workers and the history of diversity.

383
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:54,760
All of the things that I'm talking about here is basically a sociology class about it, so I'm very excited about that.

384
00:49:56,970 --> 00:50:03,750
Something that came up for me, too, is thinking about the historical context of cultural competency, especially in this school.

385
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:11,540
I I'm pretty sure that, like, isn't that where some of these, like, really stereotype assumptions come from in med school?

386
00:50:12,450 --> 00:50:15,220
Like, don't give them as because they're,

387
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:24,380
they're going to be opioid addicts and don't like they complain more about pain and things like that with certain groups maybe outside the school.

388
00:50:24,390 --> 00:50:33,500
But it really kind of like a historical context of how cultural competency has evolved in the United States by just being helpful to kind of stuff.

389
00:50:33,990 --> 00:50:40,700
Yeah, that's completely within the scope. There's actually a beyond just discrimination and bias.

390
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:44,300
Is that this actual medical. Yes.

391
00:50:44,670 --> 00:50:48,059
Like for I forget if it was liver and kidney for some transplant,

392
00:50:48,060 --> 00:50:53,850
the tests that they use for transplant, the marker to qualify for it is either higher or lower,

393
00:50:53,850 --> 00:51:00,090
whatever the thing is that disqualifies you and for black people because it adds the math,

394
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:07,960
the little math equation that they made to use it adds extra numbers in there because an individual is black.

395
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:15,809
And so if you were to run the same test into that same equation on a white individual, they may pass and qualify for the transplant.

396
00:51:15,810 --> 00:51:22,740
And if you do that, the black athlete, you know, the black person at the same stats and everything, they won't qualify for the transplant.

397
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:29,259
And so that still exists now. Still, I think people are just now the general public.

398
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:32,740
I'm sure medical professionals have talked about it for a while.

399
00:51:32,750 --> 00:51:38,020
But, you know, our public is just not kind of being aware that this is happening like that.

400
00:51:38,350 --> 00:51:46,669
So I think that's a great aspect of the training and a part that working with medical professionals and things would be great to add in there.

401
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:52,780
And not just ideas because I do want to get away from that just standard DIY except in more practical,

402
00:51:52,780 --> 00:52:00,910
like these are the medical things that people scan. They're not thicker, you know, like these medical things that you've learned aren't necessary.

403
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:07,659
Q And this is where it comes from, and this is why you work this way, but this is why it's been hard really diving in deep with that.

404
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:11,379
So yeah, tying in professionals from the beginning been very,

405
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:17,200
very helpful to get that accurate information in the training because I think that

406
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:23,650
also separate that from the kind of point and click videos and things when you know,

407
00:52:24,970 --> 00:52:29,260
medical students specifically, if it doesn't have the biology or the science in it,

408
00:52:29,260 --> 00:52:38,440
there's only now if you start talking about psychology or feelings or community social things, you're like, Why is this no anatomy?

409
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:44,970
What are we doing here? So including those aspects I think would help to engage in this process as well.

410
00:52:46,190 --> 00:52:49,480
Yeah. Like really killing people too. They just did.

411
00:52:49,490 --> 00:52:54,500
And they're trying to like. Yeah, yeah. Right.

412
00:52:54,980 --> 00:53:03,540
I think that's really. Compelling because it was one of my friends as a medical student that even brought to mind.

413
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:08,520
I knew that individuals use the E.R. more, but I really wasn't thinking about it a lot.

414
00:53:08,610 --> 00:53:14,489
He as a 30 or something, he was like, Yeah, most of the black patients that I see,

415
00:53:14,490 --> 00:53:20,399
a lot of artists have come to the E.R. and that when I do rotations in primary care,

416
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:24,210
I do think that, yeah, I thought about it, but I didn't think about it like that.

417
00:53:24,270 --> 00:53:30,270
A. It was a good. So yeah, that whole can.

418
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:36,840
But I think also having community members to avoid assumptions on both sides of it,

419
00:53:36,850 --> 00:53:41,470
having everybody at the table, which is why I really like the QPR approach to it.

420
00:53:41,890 --> 00:53:49,020
I think the different GRC has born members from Henry Ford and the hospital systems there as well.

421
00:53:49,030 --> 00:53:53,650
So that would be a great place to kind of get buy in from all sides.

422
00:53:55,330 --> 00:53:59,010
The table. And with their mistrust.

423
00:53:59,010 --> 00:54:05,540
You mentioned, I think on your slide like asking new community members about.

424
00:54:06,590 --> 00:54:13,550
Astros, and you're perfectly positioned to ask them for the solutions that they get.

425
00:54:15,930 --> 00:54:26,569
I said it just like, what are the issues, Bill? Or just very what would they need to build that trust?

426
00:54:26,570 --> 00:54:29,730
What is it from the document? Yes,

427
00:54:31,430 --> 00:54:38,990
because one thing to understand that there is mistrust and I think there's just overwhelming evidence in the research about the mistrust that exists.

428
00:54:39,410 --> 00:54:42,750
But what can be put in place to build that trust back up?

429
00:54:45,030 --> 00:54:46,919
And so I'm going a little bit with COVID, too,

430
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:56,850
I think with people trying to relate to communities and get with posting on social media and radio stations and showing that the vaccine is effective.

431
00:54:56,850 --> 00:55:02,810
And I don't know how much time they actually spent asking communities what would make you actually take.

432
00:55:02,820 --> 00:55:06,120
I think actually I appreciate some of the code,

433
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:13,410
but there were so many COVID presentations that some of them were looking at those questions and asking communities, what would.

434
00:55:13,650 --> 00:55:16,740
Why are you vaccine hesitant? What make you not vaccine hesitant?

435
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:26,190
Things like that. And those aspects, I think, are most importantly what, if anything, could happen and what would take this away from you?

436
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:31,230
What, in an ideal world, would you need true providers to feel safe?

437
00:55:34,290 --> 00:55:38,650
The big question number 37. Largely.

438
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:45,480
Thanks for that. You're not just like Green Party. Even though it is a fairly healthy personal.

439
00:55:49,070 --> 00:55:54,260
We've talked about this. And so in addition to just being able to frame like what is being done, I think.

440
00:56:01,590 --> 00:56:09,770
Especially. Detroit is for years. So this pilot is making sure you're not going to die.

441
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:19,310
And like we stayed in an apartment. One quarter of a million medical students and 500 doctors can be more.

442
00:56:22,610 --> 00:56:44,299
My doctor told me, turn around and it's not for me. So in terms of looking at the literature review, the one that we're writing for class already,

443
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:50,810
I kind of focused on what feelings about cultural competency in these frameworks and ideas and things,

444
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:57,770
including the programs that are already being done, that I can find that be a separate literature review?

445
00:56:57,770 --> 00:57:03,050
Or is there a way to add that and this kind of two different searches?

446
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:13,000
In terms of like Kate's weight. Crafting it so that you can run it over and over again.

447
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:19,080
It seems that it could very well be true. And that's like a question I'm going to ask her.

448
00:57:20,530 --> 00:57:32,880
But I think it's kind of a. I feel like they're sort of the theoretical part and they're like theoretical models of what's involved in me.

449
00:57:35,780 --> 00:57:43,270
And folding in the historical piece there to just sort of understanding separation over time that is sort.

450
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:51,010
But of. I think over here where it's like what's already been done or what is being done.

451
00:57:51,810 --> 00:58:02,570
I think it will be pulling from different literatures and I like a little bit more messy, but also I think there would be some.

452
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:07,390
More standard search lets search activities which are much.

453
00:58:08,820 --> 00:58:13,760
In fact, it's been invaluable in these efforts.

454
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:18,100
Medical student education. Competence evaluations like that.

455
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:24,120
It's to be a learning curve. And I think that's more like academic literature.

456
00:58:24,690 --> 00:58:30,570
And then also maybe things like. I know things about phase three.

457
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:38,700
What are the what are the resistance is and perceptions of value of this kind of training?

458
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:50,150
As I think as you want to run some kind of support, how do you respond to community needs to actually develop better training?

459
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:53,170
I think it would be. Like the develop.

460
00:58:54,250 --> 00:58:59,750
Working knowledge and like those academic. Article is here that our.

461
00:59:02,250 --> 00:59:10,159
How people develop training and what have they done and how they've been evaluated, what the resistance when you come in with all of these trainings.

462
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:17,629
Yeah. And you have this theoretical basis. And then you kind of have this little space where you're like, okay, what's out there?

463
00:59:17,630 --> 00:59:26,970
And I was thinking, what's out there in my community working out what's out there as examples of what works well, that's a positive thing.

464
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:29,390
And so, yes, I feel like that is like an invitation.

465
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:36,110
So particular term, it's a good term, but like what are some examples of what's working well and why?

466
00:59:36,130 --> 00:59:43,480
And that's like a little more that practical. So, you know, in a few years we're like, okay, I'm gonna tell my pilot training,

467
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:47,440
I'm going to use all the knowledge that I've gained and all the theoretical pieces,

468
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:53,380
the persistence, the evaluation, what parts of the world, and also what people have tried locally.

469
00:59:54,370 --> 00:59:58,720
And you'll be super well prepared to like. Diamond.

470
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:02,829
I do it. So that's like a long answer.

471
01:00:02,830 --> 01:00:10,330
But I feel like those two parts. Are places for you to get, you know, call more information.

472
01:00:10,470 --> 01:00:16,140
Yeah. So it'd be good to talk to Kate about making pictures of this over here space of, like,

473
01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:22,890
what a lot of academics have written about so far about medical education and cultural competence.

474
01:00:22,890 --> 01:00:30,950
I mean, how does it feel? Short. Because there's a theoretical justification here, which is really good.

475
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:36,890
Right. But then like, okay, so what's the state of the literature right now?

476
01:00:38,450 --> 01:00:42,590
And it may be kind of or ineffective or maybe.

477
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:46,250
But pulling back and I think will be important. Yeah.

478
01:00:47,450 --> 01:00:57,729
And for. Next step some practical development this and I think a good amount of medical schools now at least one in every state,

479
01:00:57,730 --> 01:01:06,490
definitely more than one in every state has some sort of public health element to their medical school with an optional opt in.

480
01:01:06,490 --> 01:01:16,180
Even if it's like one semester, you add it to your programing or over the summer or spring break or something, you do a little preparation.

481
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:27,129
I know Georgetown had this mobile clinic thing that they would do with students and you could opt in for a semester or however long to do that.

482
01:01:27,130 --> 01:01:30,910
So I know most schools have something. Yeah.

483
01:01:30,940 --> 01:01:39,800
I don't know how many schools have evaluated that and how public that information is, in my view, kind of in-house information that they hold on to.

484
01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:42,940
I think that's the best way that, you know, you could.

485
01:01:42,940 --> 01:01:48,420
And I was just going to say to like you guys both said, there's a public health link semester.

486
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:52,960
You never know when our servers are the and not read.

487
01:01:55,490 --> 01:01:59,120
And this that like, does it go by public health?

488
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:03,620
Does it go by like medical communication? Does it go back?

489
01:02:03,620 --> 01:02:09,100
Like, remember, Brown had like a doctor course that was about making your personal skills generally.

490
01:02:09,260 --> 01:02:17,030
And so I think if you do do a literature review over here that was like, hey, you know, medical schools are not dumb.

491
01:02:17,030 --> 01:02:19,459
It's like they are not paying attention to these issues.

492
01:02:19,460 --> 01:02:26,100
And here's something kind of trying to address them, but they've done it by, you know, doing it in your personal communication or school.

493
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:30,830
That doesn't quite get at what I'm talking about because of how they've done it by,

494
01:02:31,070 --> 01:02:33,890
you know, talking about social determinants of health and public health,

495
01:02:34,580 --> 01:02:42,710
you know, in a public health kind of dance class or something, you know, and that doesn't quite get out of either because a lot.

496
01:02:43,100 --> 01:02:50,510
So I think that would be a really cool space for exploring and really depend on if to say to be able to say after your exploration.

497
01:02:51,830 --> 01:02:54,920
Like this isn't working. What are they doing in general?

498
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:59,690
DNI training. Yeah. It can't. Those things are missing the point.

499
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:10,280
Are comparing that to school that Wednesday. Are you Chicago or other schools who engage the community in their work and go out into the community

500
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:15,610
that they're surrounded by and do that work versus that one day the meeting was like that.

501
01:03:16,980 --> 01:03:25,090
I that you could maybe even get that you could get like an undergraduate student or someone to sort of sit at.

502
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:30,590
Like if you give them like a little checklist, you know, you could find,

503
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:36,830
see how much they can find out, like from the website or, you know, like be creative.

504
01:03:37,370 --> 01:03:44,720
I think that's what I'm hoping on this too, is that I feel like it useful to you to really know what's out there.

505
01:03:46,060 --> 01:03:53,840
And then either kind of I think you could do both and you could do a lot of individual paper about here's the sort of state of mind this

506
01:03:53,840 --> 01:04:05,540
stuff stands and doesn't meet the mark and get practical information like if you had numerical to half of the student of your student.

507
01:04:07,430 --> 01:04:12,530
Just comb through this great literature that you can identify and also like.

508
01:04:14,410 --> 01:04:19,690
Or the websites of the top 100 medical schools in the country or something like that.

509
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:23,470
And see like what? How do they talk about data, how they present it?

510
01:04:24,250 --> 01:04:28,060
Is there information they can find out about it? And like you said, and I don't think that website.

511
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:32,310
We're not safe. But if you can't find out was not.

512
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:35,560
Yeah. It's not like elevators about to be like a feature. Yeah.

513
01:04:36,310 --> 01:04:42,270
Yeah. So somebody do work like that for dental services offered at ABC.

514
01:04:42,270 --> 01:04:47,370
Used they went in and they did their literature search and kind of come through that way.

515
01:04:47,370 --> 01:04:50,640
But then they also had students go in and search themselves.

516
01:04:50,970 --> 01:04:56,700
They try to find it on the website and see if that information was accessible, hard data was things like that,

517
01:04:56,700 --> 01:05:02,190
and that added a whole other element because even if it was offered or maybe they did have something,

518
01:05:02,460 --> 01:05:09,240
if students can't go in and search for it and find out how to access it, it's not as effective as it could be.

519
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:10,799
So I think, yeah,

520
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:19,110
regardless of the literature by how much is available in literature and finding it that way is important to see how accessible it is.

521
01:05:19,260 --> 01:05:23,850
If when you have searching on the website or if you're applying to schools and trying to find.

522
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:32,200
But we did something similar last. Spectrum.

523
01:05:32,300 --> 01:05:40,540
Let's out how many brings to the table to navigate from life to college making you like a practicing.

524
01:05:43,150 --> 01:05:46,860
Yeah. How many schools did you do that with?

525
01:05:47,460 --> 01:05:51,710
So we. Okay.

526
01:05:52,360 --> 01:06:01,330
And if you how many students if you use for the clicks. Oh, you, me.

527
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:06,790
It was like a scavenger hunt. Like, what is the password?

528
01:06:06,790 --> 01:06:14,589
Trying to understand. Yeah. Mobile health is sort of like health and human beings.

529
01:06:14,590 --> 01:06:17,740
And these are like, how? How is this?

530
01:06:29,210 --> 01:06:35,650
Yeah. There's this thing where it's sort of a project where it was like looking at.

531
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:44,040
Oh, I know it was. This is the kind of thing that we were gonna start conversations of, like, would you feature this on your website?

532
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:48,120
But it was like whether companies offered genetic testing. So told.

533
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:52,520
Totally different topic. But I think somebody that they were working with.

534
01:06:53,280 --> 01:07:00,190
I wanted to do a quick analysis to say, like, my company's health insurance plan offers genetic testing.

535
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:04,760
And I was like, I would take like 50 million coins to find out.

536
01:07:05,060 --> 01:07:13,040
Yeah, but that's maybe because a company might want to hide that, that, like, buried deep in their website versus something like this.

537
01:07:14,630 --> 01:07:20,090
Mental health services which clicks. It should be up there and should be so.

538
01:07:24,150 --> 01:07:28,170
About. You might like to go somewhere.

539
01:07:28,900 --> 01:07:35,530
Yeah, well, look, that's me. Yeah, yeah, but I do.

540
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:44,889
I do think that'll be. It'll also be just really interesting for my personal search because when I was applying

541
01:07:44,890 --> 01:07:48,810
to what could have been a hint that I wanted to go to school for public health anyways,

542
01:07:49,030 --> 01:08:00,170
I. In the medical schools with their programs about community and understanding who they're serving and things like that.

543
01:08:00,180 --> 01:08:06,700
So my whole list of actually the list of schools that I had medical school ended up the same being same schools I applied to,

544
01:08:06,730 --> 01:08:13,620
but did because those are the schools that strong social determinants of health to the programs.

545
01:08:14,940 --> 01:08:22,469
So it's funny, but I think they just ended up kicking the students over to the public health school for that element of it.

546
01:08:22,470 --> 01:08:28,970
For the most part, if they weren't doing some sort of a mobile clinic or something like that.

547
01:08:29,010 --> 01:08:36,659
But yeah, so I have a, I have a list of schools that have pretty strong at least it's advertised if you Google.

548
01:08:36,660 --> 01:08:40,620
Those are the ones that pop up and nationally for that.

549
01:08:41,660 --> 01:08:45,450
You know, talking to my students, I think would be really great, too.

550
01:08:46,050 --> 01:08:53,580
Do you think it is better to focus in on one school for that portion of it,

551
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:59,010
one medical school, or to get input from as many students and providers that they can?

552
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:09,380
Yeah. I mean, it's sort of the. I would say I might be actually interested in her also fearing that the best thing that might have.

553
01:09:10,390 --> 01:09:15,980
This phase work groups. Pulling everybody together like that.

554
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:24,210
Frank Hendrix, whatever. But. I feel like if you're trying to really start your face to work with the community,

555
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:30,070
want to know pretty substantively like what's happening in that community in this space.

556
01:09:30,160 --> 01:09:36,570
And so that's where I feel like I would really dive into. Here are all the schools with that.

557
01:09:37,530 --> 01:09:41,370
You know, education, training in this geographical area.

558
01:09:41,370 --> 01:09:50,940
What is each one of you doing, the speaker, now? But I think that one broad picture of like how lots of different faces approached.

559
01:09:51,860 --> 01:09:55,040
Culturally. Competence, medical education. Training.

560
01:09:56,460 --> 01:09:59,530
It's not about literature.

561
01:10:00,310 --> 01:10:06,220
And they cross-reference that academic. The school said you have like here's an some samples.

562
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:10,570
Well. Peace. And.

563
01:10:17,230 --> 01:10:21,340
So I feel like, you know. Yeah. You know, the whole community.

564
01:10:22,330 --> 01:10:25,420
But then there's also, like, this stuff that's out there.

565
01:10:25,700 --> 01:10:32,679
Hmm. I feel like they don't have time for this, but residents would be the best population to get to.

566
01:10:32,680 --> 01:10:37,120
They just let medical school, and they come from so many different ones into one place.

567
01:10:37,390 --> 01:10:40,900
And now they're all within that community that I'm looking at.

568
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:45,670
So kind of asking them what kind of things they got from their medical school

569
01:10:46,900 --> 01:10:51,130
training and then what they're getting from that hospital that they're currently at.

570
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:58,660
I don't know what time of day a resident would have to fill out a survey or send a focus group, but they would be a great group, I think.

571
01:11:00,030 --> 01:11:03,719
This just popped in my head and this might just be irrelevant for this discussion.

572
01:11:03,720 --> 01:11:09,420
But when you check out residents and likely be focusing in on certain populations.

573
01:11:10,020 --> 01:11:16,620
Are there like programs where they'll pay for like beds, school you go to like really underserved.

574
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:23,090
There are. You get your money back. I think they pay you back for medical school and the debt.

575
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:30,140
And some places like where I came from, like Las Cruces, like we have terrible medical access to medical care in general.

576
01:11:30,770 --> 01:11:35,540
So we actually had a right to be residents. They were treating us there based on that program.

577
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:42,920
But this might just be another possibility. Nobody's interested in a different attitude.

578
01:11:42,980 --> 01:11:51,450
Like Detroit obviously is going to have lots of resources, but down the line, maybe looking at communities, what was it like if you're being sent to.

579
01:11:53,020 --> 01:12:02,020
Resource community. What difference does that make in your cultural competency during in some of those loan payback programs aren't just low

580
01:12:02,020 --> 01:12:08,440
access there like urban within a major city like I know some people go to Atlanta for that even though it was a major city,

581
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:12,190
they have a lot of resource, they have resources.

582
01:12:12,490 --> 01:12:20,650
It says it's still an urban development city in a major city that counts towards the program.

583
01:12:20,660 --> 01:12:27,130
To set it for it may have programs like that where there's resources still, but as a city in America.

584
01:12:28,540 --> 01:12:36,129
Yeah. Or they have that for rural tier. So even in rural, you know, and 70 something percent Hispanic.

585
01:12:36,130 --> 01:12:38,760
So in terms of cultural competency, that's really something.

586
01:12:39,910 --> 01:12:49,450
And the other thing that I was now there's way more information than I when I look this time,

587
01:12:49,450 --> 01:12:54,190
because I tried an element of this during my master's program.

588
01:12:54,460 --> 01:13:00,160
There wasn't a lot of models and things happening back then to look at.

589
01:13:00,160 --> 01:13:10,059
So I was comparing it to trainings for physicians going into non-English-speaking areas or other countries or things like that.

590
01:13:10,060 --> 01:13:19,600
And then paralleling that, because there are very specific trainings and processes to kind of get them equipped to go into those communities.

591
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:26,440
And so I was doing that and I did see a lot more standard trainings like individuals with disabilities or.

592
01:13:28,370 --> 01:13:35,870
I can't remember. But there's there's like very specific areas for that.

593
01:13:35,870 --> 01:13:41,540
And so even looking at non-English speakers, how the creating the things,

594
01:13:41,540 --> 01:13:45,770
I think there may be a little bit more information out there for that as well.

595
01:13:47,180 --> 01:13:51,499
Mm hmm. The other, and maybe this.

596
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:59,100
Maybe it's not this. The seat in a crowded room to look for.

597
01:14:00,680 --> 01:14:05,389
They're like, I was just like, Oh, yesterday was so short for like an hour about their senior credits.

598
01:14:05,390 --> 01:14:12,160
And one counts for continuing education and they have to do a unit to do it is really interesting.

599
01:14:12,170 --> 01:14:19,640
And they were like, we have to do we have to do certain things that are like emotional pain counts as pain and I was thing.

600
01:14:20,650 --> 01:14:24,530
Fascinating, but certainly not drama.

601
01:14:24,550 --> 01:14:31,150
But I'm wondering also if that's another space you could look at in this kind of like

602
01:14:31,150 --> 01:14:37,780
great literature review especially and maybe a future use for whatever training that,

603
01:14:37,810 --> 01:14:42,430
you know. Because that seems like another space where there's probably a lot of effort devoted.

604
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:51,839
Yeah, but like, again, I don't know. I would also love to work backwards on things that people have done.

605
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:53,999
Like in the mental health space.

606
01:14:54,000 --> 01:15:01,559
There's now a depression screening that providers use in their initial and nurses when they check and ask you your height,

607
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:05,790
weight, all that and then a whole list of depression questions.

608
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:13,650
And so it will be cool to kind of look at how that got to the place where it became standard practice

609
01:15:13,650 --> 01:15:21,150
for all for the majority of providers to ask those questions as people are entering the office.

610
01:15:22,830 --> 01:15:26,250
Seeing how the researchers developed and then how it became a place where, yeah,

611
01:15:26,250 --> 01:15:30,420
I don't know how I would go about seeing that, but I think that would be a good kind of.

612
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:37,030
Example to see what their processes were to understand.

613
01:15:38,530 --> 01:15:48,200
It's like an interesting, like, famous wife. But I thought I was also going to say that too, like having people doing like an exit survey, you know?

614
01:15:48,290 --> 01:15:52,360
Oh, yeah. How did you feel that? Did you get her? Yeah.

615
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:55,989
Yeah. And they never do. No, don't do that. Can we get your feedback?

616
01:15:55,990 --> 01:16:01,810
We have a review. Yeah. Yeah. This way they get this might be a phase ten or something,

617
01:16:02,110 --> 01:16:07,710
but I'm thinking of cultural competency, at least what comes up a lot in, like, New Mexico and.

618
01:16:08,300 --> 01:16:12,650
Like American Indian populations to this idea and African American.

619
01:16:12,650 --> 01:16:15,970
This idea of community health workers helping the brain.

620
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:22,549
Yeah. Yeah. You're working in, like, the preventive space, so I don't know where they come in in this thing,

621
01:16:22,550 --> 01:16:30,830
but I think your models and they might be up here with the stakeholders and community leaders engaging because they're doing the work too,

622
01:16:30,830 --> 01:16:35,809
like they're already in there pushing for cultural competency and understanding

623
01:16:35,810 --> 01:16:40,460
and getting their community to engage with the health care system more so.

624
01:16:40,910 --> 01:16:49,930
Yeah, the last thing I want to do is go in and say I have a brilliant idea I ever thought of before working with them specifically.

625
01:16:49,940 --> 01:16:56,150
If I do get to that, part of developing for specialties is like doulas and health care,

626
01:16:56,430 --> 01:17:00,530
a lot of birth workers and things like that in the black community.

627
01:17:00,530 --> 01:17:08,030
I think that's the largest portion of health and community health workers right now at this phase.

628
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:16,170
So the really really interesting to talk with them and hear their experiences and but we're.

629
01:17:20,790 --> 01:17:28,319
I think that's kind of it's my sense that that's where people people who are thinking a lot and don't necessarily think about,

630
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:32,000
well, oh, making sure people can get into.

631
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:40,770
Also, I don't know how to incorporate this, but there are some health care, community health care, I don't know.

632
01:17:40,780 --> 01:17:48,339
I put it health care, but community health care workers and people who are more complementary medicine or integrative medicine,

633
01:17:48,340 --> 01:17:57,850
it's not necessarily thought of as traditional that may have more engagement with the community than these clinics or traditional settings and

634
01:17:58,120 --> 01:18:10,930
seeing how to incorporate them in this process while still keeping the goal to get communities engaged with the more traditional medicine.

635
01:18:11,750 --> 01:18:17,320
And. Settings. It obvious to be your teachers of the three.

636
01:18:17,770 --> 01:18:27,390
Yeah. Oh yeah. Familiar with the community and they pay for that and they can get paid because the medical thing that we

637
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:34,890
health workers have is the very best and and especially their experiences because they engage so often.

638
01:18:34,900 --> 01:18:41,610
Right. And a lot of people don't unless they have an M.D. There are some community health workers that have that.

639
01:18:41,620 --> 01:18:50,260
But if they don't. A lot of people in the academic space, whatever, don't give them the credit as a medical professional that honestly they are.

640
01:18:50,680 --> 01:18:58,570
So I think this would be a good opportunity to kind of bridge that gap where they are the experts and, you know.

641
01:19:02,510 --> 01:19:13,880
Thank you. I have so much to take to Kate. But I was also just thinking that that reminds me of that because Bill and.

642
01:19:15,570 --> 01:19:18,800
Paul's force may be built as a homeland.

643
01:19:20,010 --> 01:19:29,370
This is Bill. He did one of the master's courses where they had community partners come and they do some.

644
01:19:33,430 --> 01:19:36,520
And so there's a little bit of a scramble that it was basically getting.

645
01:19:36,760 --> 01:19:43,840
It was an idea what it was, was like an interview between a researcher at Harvard and his video teams.

646
01:19:44,710 --> 01:19:52,090
And so they basically used those interviews over and over again, like, you know, what does it take for you as a community?

647
01:19:52,090 --> 01:19:56,950
Participated in this and talked about the process. And I think that may help workers.

648
01:19:57,250 --> 01:20:04,390
If you were able to in your training materials, once you've identified all that's done and evaluated, it means nothing like that.

649
01:20:05,350 --> 01:20:09,820
That would be a really cool way to present information.

650
01:20:10,210 --> 01:20:19,150
Right. And communicate it happen. Video any time you have a case study highlight the content time did a little bit globalize take work.

651
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:34,080
Here's something. Training video superstar, but just that idea of having literally different voices in the training materials.

652
01:20:35,970 --> 01:20:41,680
And it's that same element of like up here where it was cool because it wasn't just researchers there,

653
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:49,800
it was community members and organizers and kind of all aspects that are necessary in this work there.

654
01:20:53,290 --> 01:20:56,799
Also, Kemba makes great power points.

655
01:20:56,800 --> 01:21:00,510
I didn't know that. I love that.

656
01:21:00,580 --> 01:21:03,970
You know where he is. That just in very good.

657
01:21:04,120 --> 01:21:14,409
It's just Kim Valley. So they have all of these templates and you can pick whatever PowerPoint you want and it goes on to all

658
01:21:14,410 --> 01:21:21,820
they have is like marketing one and it did they did one of the like this is like really basic like a menu.

659
01:21:22,730 --> 01:21:30,530
In Canada. It's the same as like they let you down just to get her into the car.

660
01:21:30,850 --> 01:21:33,920
But I don't know anything. I did it all in Canada.

661
01:21:34,430 --> 01:21:39,710
So you just click the different slides and then you write whatever you want on the editing and PowerPoint.

662
01:21:41,720 --> 01:21:44,750
Um. I didn't. Oh.

663
01:21:45,170 --> 01:21:55,570
And. This one won't let me, but maybe it's like depending on how much time we had to do it.

664
01:21:56,140 --> 01:22:01,000
I said as often as I. Last night I was giving feedback on Job.

665
01:22:03,090 --> 01:22:06,220
And so. We want to provide feedback.

666
01:22:08,100 --> 01:22:13,200
There's just too many colors going on in this light. It's a consistent piece of music.

667
01:22:13,950 --> 01:22:21,299
And so, you know, it's nice to be able to use that, the free thought of you in that way.

668
01:22:21,300 --> 01:22:25,820
But and about the topic like this is different.

669
01:22:26,980 --> 01:22:31,600
I think if you had to create it, you had to put it like that to people or, you know,

670
01:22:31,620 --> 01:22:38,130
if you had to do something for the line, why did they have for tables the part of this.

671
01:22:38,160 --> 01:22:43,630
Yeah. Yeah. I mean that's unless you already have the table in here somewhere.

672
01:22:43,750 --> 01:22:48,000
Yeah. Cause that's the one that I use with this one.

673
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:55,030
And it had the table. Do you have, like, images taken from other places?

674
01:22:55,480 --> 01:23:00,940
Put them in as an admin. I did, but one of them had a table in it and I removed it.

675
01:23:01,270 --> 01:23:07,060
And so that table was when I double click. Did it kind of did that same Excel thing on the side where you enter the numbers.

676
01:23:07,570 --> 01:23:15,400
And so I saw where it was because there was a table, but I don't know how you would insert the table on it.

677
01:23:15,510 --> 01:23:24,249
Oh, maybe it's there now that it has, you know, a apart point has like those smart functions where you can easily create like diagrams.

678
01:23:24,250 --> 01:23:30,250
I don't know the businesses there they do have because I was at first the conceptual model part.

679
01:23:30,460 --> 01:23:35,650
This is actually one I redid and like redo the arrows and things.

680
01:23:35,650 --> 01:23:42,790
But this was I put in conceptual model template tables, graphs, charts.

681
01:23:43,030 --> 01:23:48,819
You just have to it's harder because you have to find one that works and then edit it to fit use.

682
01:23:48,820 --> 01:23:52,810
It took me a while to comb through versus PowerPoint because just kind of put in the elements in it.

683
01:23:52,820 --> 01:24:00,020
Smart, create what you want. So it's a little less intuitive, but I feel like sometimes it's PowerPoint all the time.

684
01:24:00,040 --> 01:24:04,280
Let's get kind of played out in there. People get you right in there.

685
01:24:04,450 --> 01:24:10,059
Oh, we've seen this before, but this adds like little elements of things that people maybe haven't seen before.

686
01:24:10,060 --> 01:24:13,810
And so anything like graphics like that are you're allowed to use.

687
01:24:14,730 --> 01:24:21,730
Yeah, yeah. All of these little elements there are none of them or what is it called watermark except for the pictures.

688
01:24:21,730 --> 01:24:25,120
And I was using my own pictures anyway so it didn't really.

689
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:29,020
Yeah. Care was cool as me now I.

690
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:39,100
You guys might not like when you've given quite the same, you know, 70 to 80% the same time in life.

691
01:24:40,730 --> 01:24:49,690
I think it's, you know, many, many venues. And then I'm like, okay, I got to give it again, but I got to fix it up somehow and feel around.

692
01:24:50,400 --> 01:25:02,820
Serious life changing just to make it look yeah didn't really reflect newish top 50 to 70% knew that I think the Google like.

693
01:25:04,410 --> 01:25:17,309
Mary Jo. Yeah. Oh, I've never had Google Slides done that, but then I like slides, but then they're different.

694
01:25:17,310 --> 01:25:21,620
Like, that's why I want and then use the. Different from the PowerPoint that use.

695
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:30,190
I use. I made a Google website for the first time recently.

696
01:25:30,550 --> 01:25:38,280
I was very impressed by that because I'm not equipped for technology at all, but it was pretty nice.

697
01:25:38,290 --> 01:25:44,379
Once you get past the initial like the template they give you to start off with, it's very basic.

698
01:25:44,380 --> 01:25:52,600
And clearly Google, if you play around with the different themes and phrases they have, eventually you get to some that look like an actual website.

699
01:25:52,860 --> 01:25:58,379
So this is nice. Because that is related to the question.

700
01:25:58,380 --> 01:26:06,000
What I would have to do with the paper is I've also done like a live review that has like super limited.

701
01:26:06,450 --> 01:26:19,230
There's only four different spots. So I guess the purpose of this paper we can deviate from like sticking with the Keith Sailor

702
01:26:19,710 --> 01:26:23,910
version of the live event just to fill in the information that we need to do this properly.

703
01:26:24,180 --> 01:26:29,830
Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I think. I think I was just, like, reading over again, but.

704
01:26:34,740 --> 01:26:39,610
I feel like mine. I did a similar approach and I think I have like five different, like.

705
01:26:40,500 --> 01:26:43,549
Yeah. I'm like, well,

706
01:26:43,550 --> 01:26:46,340
you know that that article that they don't think I'm going to make you look

707
01:26:46,390 --> 01:26:53,000
back on that one that's like 14 different types of interviews and the like.

708
01:26:53,000 --> 01:27:01,700
Stuff like live review, like, like not to like lower case in our case are just like can be Google Scholar.

709
01:27:01,700 --> 01:27:05,690
And that's an information I generally don't focus on hanging out in this area.

710
01:27:06,470 --> 01:27:09,770
You know what I mean? Like, I know what I know.

711
01:27:10,760 --> 01:27:14,540
I've been searching it for a long time that I need to find different people.

712
01:27:14,540 --> 01:27:18,079
And it's ever done like. This very specific thing, I suppose.

713
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:29,540
I didn't know that. I'm just thankful that. You can't really you can't really start there if it's a few hundred troops.

714
01:27:29,580 --> 01:27:36,060
Right. Where you could start from right there. But if you want to be a little more systematic, some more.

715
01:27:38,700 --> 01:27:43,290
Yeah. Like you should feel like every time you do that review, that has to be.

716
01:27:46,510 --> 01:27:59,380
Every time you review furniture entering Centrelink. Well, but, you know, in the new space and if you want to make a point like.

717
01:28:00,920 --> 01:28:05,630
Like this. Many people migrated. Right?

718
01:28:06,160 --> 01:28:14,480
Yes, unfortunately, but. A middle ground of like, I'm not going to have a huge commitment to this, but I need to know about my child's mental health.

719
01:28:15,830 --> 01:28:20,450
And I was like, there should be. Doing.

720
01:28:24,790 --> 01:28:32,290
Yeah. I think I might do the that informal part of it.

721
01:28:32,290 --> 01:28:33,970
This is a me with Kate anyways.

722
01:28:34,240 --> 01:28:43,569
Maybe build on it after this is over and do some more because I don't think I have time to do as in-depth as I want to turn in that paper.

723
01:28:43,570 --> 01:28:48,670
But I think that there's definitely a lot of material there to be able to flesh it out.

724
01:28:49,300 --> 01:28:51,820
And maybe I'll hear what a break is to do.

725
01:28:52,330 --> 01:28:59,860
Yeah, well, I think a lot of the stuff that we've just been talking about, where do you go with that for a long time?

726
01:28:59,860 --> 01:29:06,040
You know what I mean? Like, you wouldn't be able to count down all of those suggestions and I come up as a six favorite.

727
01:29:06,050 --> 01:29:13,720
Yeah, but that idea of heading for your paper, probably like integrating some of, like, what we know already.

728
01:29:13,720 --> 01:29:19,790
What's been done? Like a cursory treatment of. Here's kind of what we know in this space already.

729
01:29:19,790 --> 01:29:28,110
What's contrived I think is important is the fact that, yeah, you can go on that topic like.

730
01:29:30,720 --> 01:29:36,450
How do you navigate finding papers and literature that is from the abstract and

731
01:29:36,450 --> 01:29:40,499
the material seems like it's really crucial to the literature review in the paper,

732
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:42,990
but then that you can't get access to it.

733
01:29:43,710 --> 01:29:48,570
Do you still include that based on the abstract information, or do you leave it out so you can't read the whole thing?

734
01:29:48,720 --> 01:29:57,720
Yeah, it's hard. So if you really can't get access to it, like in a timely fashion through the library alone, that should be pretty.

735
01:29:58,170 --> 01:30:06,090
Oh, okay. Sure. I mean, sometimes they can get with it if it exists in electronic format, like, okay.

736
01:30:07,950 --> 01:30:11,130
If they like literally have to send a poem or something.

737
01:30:11,700 --> 01:30:14,670
And I've just been I've kind of searched what I have done.

738
01:30:14,970 --> 01:30:21,300
If I needed it, like urgently, I would like find something my back on there and see if I can get something else.

739
01:30:21,430 --> 01:30:26,910
Oh, okay. Same thing. Um, but.

740
01:30:27,870 --> 01:30:31,410
But the interlibrary loan should work for that. Sure. Okay.

741
01:30:31,530 --> 01:30:35,790
Yeah. And I know that needs to become familiar, but I think it still is.

742
01:30:36,810 --> 01:30:41,620
If you thought and logged in that have that and I have to get it.

743
01:30:41,640 --> 01:30:48,750
But is this pleasant? Oh, do I have to be on the like the VPN if I'm at home or.

744
01:30:50,290 --> 01:30:54,760
If you can't, it should be just throw your if you're unlikely to sign into law.

745
01:30:55,690 --> 01:31:01,040
Oh, okay. So keep that open in another tab or something and then possibly.

746
01:31:03,220 --> 01:31:07,629
Oh, I'm doing Google. I was doing I was researching I guess it was Google.

747
01:31:07,630 --> 01:31:13,780
But if I'm sent into my you miss Google, you just don't do that Google scholar like that.

748
01:31:13,780 --> 01:31:18,480
And apparently you're your. Okay.

749
01:31:19,350 --> 01:31:23,940
So when I do like, I just have a tab. Look, if I know I find something and I want to get it.

750
01:31:25,050 --> 01:31:28,950
I have a tab on, you know, just a few of them.

751
01:31:29,200 --> 01:31:34,310
Yeah. Will start, cause I'm like, cool and everything. Okay.

752
01:31:34,970 --> 01:31:41,870
And then I just if I do that, I'm not already logged in before my e-mail, which I'm usually pretty much always logged in.

753
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:47,170
Then it'll come to me for my, you know, preference for credentials.

754
01:31:49,100 --> 01:31:52,459
This thing on my phone and it will give me whenever you want.

755
01:31:52,460 --> 01:31:59,760
It has that if you go in that way they should be able to come and get it back.

756
01:32:00,080 --> 01:32:03,780
Okay. Or availability. Place to click.

757
01:32:04,850 --> 01:32:08,570
And that should get you many things, but yet you can't get it from there.

758
01:32:09,170 --> 01:32:13,340
Then there's a few more clicks in the queue and take a look at it.

759
01:32:14,630 --> 01:32:22,820
Yeah, some of the things or I saw there was a list of cited by and then somebody cited that article and it was kind of the same topic.

760
01:32:22,940 --> 01:32:27,020
Yeah. And then I would read that the second article and see if you could get the same place.

761
01:32:27,140 --> 01:32:31,580
Okay. Now and then would you cite the both articles?

762
01:32:31,820 --> 01:32:37,130
And I think so. I would call that like sort of a snowballing review.

763
01:32:37,190 --> 01:32:40,700
I like you're in the article and you're like, Oh, they're talking about all this great stuff.

764
01:32:40,700 --> 01:32:43,760
And then you go to the next article and you don't end up going back.

765
01:32:44,180 --> 01:32:47,300
I think just said these guys was like, Oh, yeah, okay.

766
01:32:48,350 --> 01:32:55,009
You know, I think if you cite the product, it is from the first one and then find a way to put that in your citation list.

767
01:32:55,010 --> 01:32:58,030
But I've definitely had that experience where I like, you know,

768
01:32:58,550 --> 01:33:04,220
reading this and I get I go into the rabbit hole of like references and I'm like, Oh, these are much better.

769
01:33:04,220 --> 01:33:07,620
And so I ended up here and saying, okay, cool. Yeah.

770
01:33:10,780 --> 01:33:15,030
Yeah. Yeah, I know. Well, yeah.

771
01:33:15,140 --> 01:33:23,490
Let me. Other people are. And otherwise we can.

772
01:33:25,270 --> 01:33:30,260
US and. And.

773
01:33:35,550 --> 01:33:40,940
Plans and suspects. And I'll get papers for.

774
01:33:41,500 --> 01:33:46,130
Is it? Oh.

775
01:33:46,330 --> 01:33:50,680
Peer review. Yea, yea yea. I haven't put it out there but I will.

776
01:33:52,780 --> 01:33:55,860
Okay. Cool. Perfect.

777
01:33:56,540 --> 01:34:04,830
I'll give something back and. All in service of this kind of togetherness.

778
01:34:06,040 --> 01:34:11,480
Going on. I'm going to.

779
01:34:15,700 --> 01:34:18,880
No, I said yeah. Thank you. Yeah, yeah, for sure.

780
01:34:20,900 --> 01:34:25,400
You know, people lose weight.

781
01:34:25,450 --> 01:34:30,620
And this is really helpful, especially I'm going to be able to.

782
01:34:33,750 --> 01:34:37,480
Just kind. I get used to it. A lot of us kids.

783
01:34:38,410 --> 01:34:42,060
But this isn't like, what's your proposed research project?

784
01:34:42,190 --> 01:34:49,720
How they go about it now. It's like, I don't know, but they've helped a lot, so now I'm kind of bringing that out.

785
01:34:51,660 --> 01:34:56,320
And I think to myself, I keep hearing that fear and I get.

786
01:34:59,960 --> 01:35:04,430
But a lot of conspiracy. What do you mean?

787
01:35:04,630 --> 01:35:08,880
Let's hear. Right. I kind of know.

788
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:12,140
I don't know fully yet. So, yeah, you know, it's good.

789
01:35:12,150 --> 01:35:19,390
It's. The approach specs and performance of any purpose.

790
01:35:20,360 --> 01:35:23,580
I really think that when you.

791
01:35:29,920 --> 01:35:33,930
Oh, we do. We actually, that's where we came to do what?

792
01:35:33,940 --> 01:35:37,160
And that looks like a good way to get her ideas.

793
01:35:37,200 --> 01:35:40,450
Like, at least put the First Amendment down on paper.

794
01:35:52,430 --> 01:36:04,920
For sure. One connection with two is that it's this idea of, like, comparing calls to any expertise in.

795
01:36:05,430 --> 01:36:08,850
Public policy analysis. I've.

796
01:36:13,750 --> 01:36:20,800
Yeah, but I can talk to you about that today. With that, I'll look at what's happening this weekend to see if I can figure out that.

797
01:36:24,280 --> 01:36:28,130
First there. Yeah.

798
01:36:28,140 --> 01:36:31,270
And I. Her picture to.

799
01:36:38,660 --> 01:36:42,910
Yeah. We can find. About.

800
01:36:42,910 --> 01:36:46,050
God bless. Plus better.

801
01:36:49,440 --> 01:36:57,190
Yes. Your. So help us to come down to our families, friends and families and talk to them.

802
01:36:57,230 --> 01:37:05,320
Dr. Policy sense and not the kind of.

803
01:37:06,510 --> 01:37:10,590
Because that's something that keeps coming up. Everybody saying this is going to happen to everybody.

804
01:37:12,390 --> 01:37:18,780
Right. I kind of stumbled across the state that might be doing some sort of innovative stuff and trying to think about like.

805
01:37:21,450 --> 01:37:29,030
And then have a similar in terms of like what's been what what are people doing and what can we learn from them?

806
01:37:29,640 --> 01:37:36,090
Right. Right. And if some states are already doing it, maybe there's more political will to kind of get into some of those directions.

807
01:37:38,360 --> 01:37:41,960
But I'm so used to behavioral health is like, yes. In the water, right?

808
01:37:43,940 --> 01:37:47,300
Yes, right. It's a very different. Yeah.

809
01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:53,330
And I did and I like when the was working with the colleges like in Michigan it's a very.

810
01:37:54,860 --> 01:37:59,340
It's that kind of work that you. Policy.

811
01:38:00,660 --> 01:38:06,020
He. That's the perfect moment.

812
01:38:06,860 --> 01:38:10,860
And so. Other areas that.

813
01:38:15,080 --> 01:38:19,040
I didn't return. Something.

814
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:29,980
But I think my families.

815
01:38:31,140 --> 01:38:42,010
Yeah. Thanks for taking the time. Yeah. But the that happened and that's what everybody's calling out for.

816
01:38:42,010 --> 01:38:46,140
Why don't we do it this.

817
01:38:47,880 --> 01:38:53,020
I think that's the other show that can just turned. Signal receiver.

818
01:38:54,210 --> 01:39:01,340
He has come down from the. Yeah.

819
01:39:01,460 --> 01:39:10,270
They haven't been accepting applications for. Yeah. Other legislation with some teeth.

820
01:39:15,100 --> 01:39:20,510
One. And then there's.

821
01:39:23,020 --> 01:39:26,180
Think that that is. That are.

822
01:39:27,170 --> 01:39:33,480
A lot of people are calling out like state level policy policies like living in a state with stricter and in fact.

823
01:39:36,080 --> 01:39:43,090
If there wasn't a driver's license which Michigan is not the to. And like just different, you know, different things like that.

824
01:39:43,420 --> 01:39:50,980
Yeah. The thing that we're trying to achieve, like whether you can give them, like, a school or someplace score and.

825
01:39:53,350 --> 01:40:06,950
Discrimination against. All right?

826
01:40:08,670 --> 01:40:15,010
Yeah. Yeah.

827
01:40:15,130 --> 01:40:18,320
Yeah, sure. You want to stay here?

828
01:40:24,310 --> 01:40:27,810
At the same time. But.

829
01:40:31,730 --> 01:40:35,180
I saw that come out in the water.

830
01:40:48,820 --> 01:41:05,050
It's almost. Instructions for the research presentations that.

831
01:41:05,740 --> 01:41:10,410
The suggestion circulating. So when you're.

832
01:41:19,900 --> 01:41:23,770
I think for the background, I think that things are.

833
01:41:30,150 --> 01:41:35,410
How about you? I think it's probably most.

834
01:41:36,470 --> 01:41:53,430
Campus. I think the main thing is to try to have.

835
01:41:57,880 --> 01:42:40,880
I have never seen. Okay.

836
01:42:41,200 --> 01:42:54,230
I mean, if you have. I think. I guess when that happens, I think you're being.

837
01:43:00,130 --> 01:43:18,050
Yeah. Three quarters you that.

838
01:43:26,940 --> 01:43:32,730
So yeah, yeah, we're focused on like how specific to other areas for research.

839
01:43:40,570 --> 01:43:43,840
What? Yeah. And how?

840
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:53,050
That's $0.24. Well, it depends on where the person is situated in their life.

841
01:43:53,660 --> 01:43:56,850
And so what I think for.

842
01:43:57,830 --> 01:44:06,670
So I also think it's important to. I think that you.

843
01:44:08,600 --> 01:44:16,590
She went on. In other forms that continue to do so, I think for a few.

844
01:44:19,850 --> 01:44:24,550
Specific. Make sure your cards can.

845
01:44:26,360 --> 01:44:29,410
And you never think about it. So don't try.

846
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:39,140
It doesn't need to be exhaustive. And I think that people who were earlier in their school, I think,

847
01:44:39,410 --> 01:44:51,950
was really interested in thinking about it and is not sure how we get implemented in action, which is fine.

848
01:44:53,390 --> 01:44:56,850
But I think that you could get more and more recent.

849
01:44:57,960 --> 01:45:07,140
Especially. I would say. Go ahead. You know, one of the ideas that.

850
01:45:10,580 --> 01:45:21,560
If there's one that's like. We know what you don't.

851
01:45:22,580 --> 01:45:25,720
No. Anyone here like this or not?

852
01:45:25,870 --> 01:45:28,940
You try this new idea. Yeah. So sort of.

853
01:45:31,280 --> 01:45:35,920
If you're in the sort of. That's it. Right now the biggest issue that.

854
01:45:36,560 --> 01:45:43,510
Is that all? Like.

855
01:45:45,410 --> 01:45:48,710
The opportunity he hopes faces. How do we either.

856
01:45:49,380 --> 01:45:53,990
Adapt to current interventions. Interventions that.

857
01:45:55,690 --> 01:45:59,540
College context. And so thinking about all this sort of saw.

858
01:46:02,140 --> 01:46:07,740
One just figuring out what it is. That's a sort of the.

859
01:46:10,630 --> 01:46:16,270
Prevention is what's being done. I'm thinking about just doing focus groups with students.

860
01:46:16,590 --> 01:46:22,400
Policyholders and municipal. To sort of establish that.

861
01:46:27,010 --> 01:46:33,280
They're going to figure out. With potentially. What he's doing is actually what they're doing.

862
01:46:33,730 --> 01:46:37,330
Here's what. Think back to the 1937.

863
01:46:48,160 --> 01:46:52,990
That's sort of what I've been thinking about this week, that I don't know if that is the right path for.

864
01:46:57,220 --> 01:47:03,970
I think that sounds like a good plan. My question might be, is it what you say?

865
01:47:04,730 --> 01:47:10,240
And this is the kind of stuff. You seem to play. Community college.

866
01:47:11,370 --> 01:47:16,580
How would that? Like the fact that the landscape analysis.

867
01:47:21,440 --> 01:47:25,550
Very. He stresses across different communities.

868
01:47:26,270 --> 01:47:32,089
So he's now having more and more scrutiny on a variety of different programs.

869
01:47:32,090 --> 01:47:40,110
And so based on. But let me say.

870
01:47:49,100 --> 01:47:52,150
Counseling services that are offered to increase the diversity.

871
01:47:56,790 --> 01:47:59,870
He doesn't have to. We?

872
01:48:04,010 --> 01:48:19,310
For schools that may not have that. All these things are going to.

873
01:48:20,280 --> 01:48:34,150
For years things and just haven't been to place. So the landscape in that analysis, you wouldn't be able to kind of know.

874
01:48:41,470 --> 01:48:48,090
And then. In healthy minds today being able to.

875
01:48:56,640 --> 01:49:01,440
In these, like, chunks of format delivery here.

876
01:49:02,610 --> 01:49:08,310
What? I want you to. They make the assumption that the monument would have been.

877
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:16,420
And this is sort of like. He screams a little bit.

878
01:49:22,530 --> 01:49:27,430
Hopefully. Your picture is not.

879
01:49:32,280 --> 01:49:35,390
With these complex arrangements. Interesting.

880
01:49:38,230 --> 01:49:43,030
Yeah. And so would a student at a community college who doesn't have.

881
01:49:44,900 --> 01:49:55,420
Students that they get. But the newsroom responded with a correspondent for the White House letter to her seven or.

882
01:50:08,070 --> 01:50:11,790
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Wireless broadband.

883
01:50:16,460 --> 01:50:28,670
Right. Right. And. Building a very specific purpose.

884
01:50:31,240 --> 01:50:44,840
The bank. With due process for potentially bridging that gap.

885
01:50:45,200 --> 01:50:49,400
But I also feel like. A whole different there.

886
01:50:49,800 --> 01:50:53,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just trying to think about where the.

887
01:50:57,200 --> 01:51:00,290
Yeah, I know. And I think that those three steps feel.

888
01:51:01,330 --> 01:51:11,370
Feasible to. Present. That represents a consensus around how to separate consumer.

889
01:51:13,550 --> 01:51:17,600
And I like the idea that you want. Focus groups.

890
01:51:18,680 --> 01:51:21,890
And based. From.

891
01:51:23,480 --> 01:51:29,140
Another you. Good luck to present and.

892
01:51:31,630 --> 01:51:36,580
Yeah. 40% of civil servants apply.

893
01:51:36,910 --> 01:51:43,320
Michigan State's 37,003. Like that.

894
01:51:58,860 --> 01:52:02,839
No, no, no. I think it's because you've done a good job.

895
01:52:02,840 --> 01:52:10,880
I think of like illustrating like in your five presentations, talking about, you know, here's the variability and like the variability.

896
01:52:12,340 --> 01:52:16,030
Some of these availability amounts of variability in.

897
01:52:18,220 --> 01:52:24,880
Thinking. Okay. How? What kind of information we need to gather.

898
01:52:26,990 --> 01:52:40,020
Vaccinations and. I think it sounds to me like it's a good level of detail for his presentation to you in terms of like.

899
01:52:42,490 --> 01:52:53,760
Yeah. Really? What the next steps for the.

900
01:52:59,900 --> 01:53:08,940
But the schools have. His words are just so awesome.

901
01:53:10,260 --> 01:53:13,800
Like it allows you to get further in here.

902
01:53:20,070 --> 01:53:23,580
How much have you changed? The the meeting.

903
01:53:32,480 --> 01:53:45,240
You're doing great. Just nationally over the last few years.

904
01:53:45,240 --> 01:53:51,660
The Republican. Prescription painkillers like these are.

905
01:53:56,050 --> 01:54:06,580
To hear. So kind of even.

906
01:54:08,930 --> 01:54:16,479
Like we're on the neat side, but. Yes.

907
01:54:16,480 --> 01:54:22,670
The sort of musical feeling the students. Really. Relationships have these kind of characteristics.

908
01:54:23,490 --> 01:54:29,800
Mental health outcomes and the. You should be the one here, but.

909
01:54:31,700 --> 01:54:37,930
A policy piece. How do you balance? But.

910
01:54:39,780 --> 01:54:44,120
Are. And then also the fourth version is an idea that I.

911
01:54:47,200 --> 01:54:53,660
How? All right.

912
01:54:57,400 --> 01:55:05,590
Our ground. Having some sort of.

913
01:55:06,330 --> 01:55:14,960
I didn't expect to see that. I think that would be a great.

914
01:55:19,810 --> 01:55:23,470
They are trying for. All of these.

915
01:55:31,540 --> 01:55:42,370
So now we're going to play. This is like your heartless valentine.

916
01:55:42,780 --> 01:55:49,590
Even though the availability. Version of.

917
01:55:53,170 --> 01:56:05,130
Here. And I feel like this is. Justin and hopefully eventually, they'll all.

918
01:56:08,210 --> 01:56:17,960
And so this presentation right here. So.

919
01:56:24,760 --> 01:56:46,990
This is where I see the. Going back.

920
01:56:51,990 --> 01:57:01,330
Space. These pieces fit.

921
01:57:04,280 --> 01:57:07,810
Really disorientated. Understanding.

922
01:57:09,760 --> 01:57:13,290
But the research that. Landscape.

923
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:21,520
You really understand what? What are.

924
01:57:23,310 --> 01:57:27,460
Technologies. Right.

925
01:57:29,720 --> 01:57:34,490
Judgment. Access to their. And then.

926
01:57:44,100 --> 01:57:51,280
Yeah. Huh? We keep going.

927
01:57:51,280 --> 01:57:55,690
That's going to be your moderator. I know it's mine.

928
01:57:55,910 --> 01:58:02,130
So whether or not. I still can't keep talking about.

929
01:58:03,020 --> 01:58:08,480
She had to think about how does it matter? But this relationship as well.

930
01:58:08,490 --> 01:58:12,980
And if someone. And this would be.

931
01:58:15,940 --> 01:58:32,470
Then do something. Well, and I think that's true with as access is here.

932
01:58:34,070 --> 01:58:40,960
And access like. It's that. I may exist in a community.

933
01:58:41,260 --> 01:58:47,000
Someone's got to be. Depression.

934
01:59:14,010 --> 01:59:17,370
Right. And. But so.

935
01:59:19,110 --> 01:59:27,780
It's like it's like mental health, access to, you know, drinking and that sort of thing across these two boxes like.

936
01:59:29,030 --> 01:59:34,740
Is mental health access. It's like these things are bigger.

937
01:59:35,550 --> 01:59:39,710
And that's kind of. He's going to better things.

938
01:59:41,520 --> 01:59:51,600
These people are here. And they have all these things that, you know, I have been.

939
01:59:52,620 --> 01:59:58,050
The connection between these people. They're like few, whatever.

940
02:00:07,670 --> 02:00:11,090
Certain things like access, whether or not it's there.

941
02:00:11,750 --> 02:00:18,730
I think it's there. There's nothing. They're looking to engage in this kind of.

942
02:00:20,020 --> 02:00:24,530
That's right. In order to change that.

943
02:00:25,270 --> 02:00:28,580
That's right. It's not just like.

944
02:00:30,110 --> 02:00:34,440
Access. Moderation.

945
02:00:37,420 --> 02:00:42,300
It's like, well, that's what. Things could be.

946
02:00:45,270 --> 02:00:49,810
Yeah. Cage and his family then.

947
02:00:52,920 --> 02:00:56,390
Kinds of things. But then there.

948
02:00:57,650 --> 02:01:05,040
But. Right.

949
02:01:08,410 --> 02:01:12,780
I just made it messier. But yeah.

950
02:01:12,780 --> 02:01:16,439
And that and I agree with those would be to side arrows and stuff.

951
02:01:16,440 --> 02:01:23,820
But I think like there's that question. Like this Fox Business Foundation.

952
02:01:23,850 --> 02:01:27,150
I like to give people a sense.

953
02:01:28,080 --> 02:01:33,090
Just because we know people they don't know.

954
02:01:33,090 --> 02:01:40,160
Like there's no motivation to realize their decisions or their stigma or whatever else.

955
02:01:41,470 --> 02:01:49,840
There's tick tock. And if there were utilization, there would be less, maybe depression sometime.

956
02:01:50,540 --> 02:01:55,190
But access is kind of outside because access has to be there.

957
02:01:56,360 --> 02:02:02,220
I have been sent and the with access but nothing really.

958
02:02:07,700 --> 02:02:11,479
There. Yes. Yes.

959
02:02:11,480 --> 02:02:14,930
But they didn't break that cycle. How do you define that?

960
02:02:14,930 --> 02:02:21,450
I think the. Along with that over here to the west?

961
02:02:22,170 --> 02:02:28,420
Yes. Yes. And by assets, I guess there's questions about access to the.

962
02:02:29,990 --> 02:02:35,860
Now assessing. So that is like utilization.

963
02:02:40,430 --> 02:02:47,610
In-person access the ability. I think there are.

964
02:02:49,230 --> 02:02:53,010
I think availability is more at the college level.

965
02:02:53,690 --> 02:02:58,350
And so is this something that is available to student students?

966
02:02:59,180 --> 02:03:06,040
Access is more at the individual level, so even if it's available are things that are meant to be accessible.

967
02:03:08,090 --> 02:03:16,000
And then, you know. More. But even if I have a little bit of sensitivity and I actually tend to be like.

968
02:03:18,990 --> 02:03:22,120
That's assuming that. You.

969
02:03:23,160 --> 02:03:27,260
Okay. So that breaks it down even a little further.

970
02:03:27,490 --> 02:03:32,580
Just put it in order, right? That's what I think.

971
02:03:32,830 --> 02:03:39,480
Because you would be. So availability is kind of I think in the longer or.

972
02:03:42,150 --> 02:03:51,630
And perhaps. Seems like it incorporates like are there specific?

973
02:03:52,660 --> 02:03:56,020
I think you could. Yeah. It's, like, a bit more.

974
02:03:57,810 --> 02:04:08,540
If access. Operationalizing what is accurate, what measures?

975
02:04:13,280 --> 02:04:24,850
Ladies and. You know, is it like, gosh, I'm really motivated.

976
02:04:25,040 --> 02:04:30,620
Yeah, but I don't know. Then it feels like you've run into something.

977
02:04:31,460 --> 02:04:36,220
Like There's something out there. Insurance to access it.

978
02:04:38,020 --> 02:04:41,890
Where you need to be different. Like the things that you we need to be aggressive.

979
02:04:42,790 --> 02:04:50,160
County or something. I would say, like you could either say, well, as.

980
02:04:55,740 --> 02:05:00,390
Yeah. Like community mental health exists between county residents and.

981
02:05:01,480 --> 02:05:10,850
And you're not. Since it's not available to you, but it's not available to provide access to that person's life.

982
02:05:15,190 --> 02:05:24,050
It's out there, so it's available. So that becomes the hours that your schedule doesn't allow for it.

983
02:05:25,360 --> 02:05:31,120
So that's like watching the ball. But.

984
02:05:33,550 --> 02:05:46,840
Utilize it? Yeah, there are certain things you can play out that are very strict with access and not availability, but also you can access it.

985
02:05:47,660 --> 02:05:54,290
There's no availability to you as an individual. And then.

986
02:05:56,350 --> 02:06:01,490
Like that. Organization. What?

987
02:06:05,440 --> 02:06:13,610
Possible. But I have to do things. Yes, sir.

988
02:06:15,020 --> 02:06:20,780
But I think when you were saying access earlier, I was thinking of availability because I think that availability of access.

989
02:06:23,780 --> 02:06:28,840
And that that. So we have individual entrepreneurs.

990
02:06:37,390 --> 02:06:44,440
Depending on which theory. What's availability?

991
02:06:44,570 --> 02:06:47,980
What's access? I think that statistically like.

992
02:06:55,660 --> 02:07:00,610
Time varies variable like your schedule changes by semester so you could access something.

993
02:07:03,050 --> 02:07:07,340
It contains members of the nobility. Still.

994
02:07:18,590 --> 02:07:21,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah. But yeah, that's cool. So I think.

995
02:07:26,380 --> 02:07:41,210
All of those things like bringing out the those. Intervention.

996
02:07:52,860 --> 02:08:04,260
You know. I don't know. Looks like. My final draft or my paper, I think, right now.

997
02:08:08,530 --> 02:08:15,280
Maybe trying to do too much in that part of the. You can feel.

998
02:08:16,130 --> 02:08:20,200
But basically the way it stands right now is. Try to start with like that.

999
02:08:20,210 --> 02:08:31,670
You. College student. And the use of the water.

1000
02:08:35,970 --> 02:08:40,810
And so I think the big ones that Stern talked about was talking about the first four years.

1001
02:08:45,460 --> 02:08:49,080
And as a. College students.

1002
02:08:51,280 --> 02:09:02,630
Service offerings currently exist in some. There were other community colleges.

1003
02:09:05,030 --> 02:09:08,410
The technology has improved mental health significantly.

1004
02:09:11,230 --> 02:09:15,780
The. Especially in response to COVID and how that has persisted.

1005
02:09:30,220 --> 02:09:36,900
Huge. Yeah.

1006
02:09:37,350 --> 02:09:42,510
So that's where it stands now. Not sure if I should think about resigning this.

1007
02:09:44,680 --> 02:09:57,110
I think there. I think this is good because you're really not going to get into the.

1008
02:09:59,080 --> 02:10:06,910
But I think the idea of bringing in I was going to say like the measures might be more detailed, but I think it's a very reason design.

1009
02:10:13,120 --> 02:10:16,610
And that is again. So I think that this is very.

1010
02:10:17,480 --> 02:10:21,090
Cool. Hasn't been flattering. Oh, I'm glad.

1011
02:10:25,480 --> 02:10:28,560
I was just such a. Yeah.

1012
02:10:28,860 --> 02:10:35,160
So it's good. And it's, I think it's great that you've been, you know, working in this space your.

1013
02:10:35,330 --> 02:10:39,180
You know, it's like, you know, you're phenomenal. And so.

1014
02:10:40,360 --> 02:10:45,380
I think that. Yeah, right.

1015
02:10:46,140 --> 02:10:49,260
Well, you just have a sense of where things stand.

1016
02:10:50,160 --> 02:10:57,290
I'm really excited to see what has been happening. So on an outside perspective to be like.

1017
02:10:58,580 --> 02:11:03,530
It's like 30 something. I try not to do that so often.

1018
02:11:07,200 --> 02:11:13,140
That's great. That's great. And it looks like, you know, pressure to pull. Wonder how much it means to her.

1019
02:11:14,420 --> 02:11:17,420
So I have to talk to them.

1020
02:11:18,460 --> 02:11:22,290
Good, good, good. Yeah. Yeah. I'll get your advice.

1021
02:11:22,300 --> 02:11:25,530
Feedback, peer review, feedback. And just sort of.

1022
02:11:28,420 --> 02:11:48,190
Provide additional. Oh, yeah, right.

1023
02:11:51,480 --> 02:12:10,870
Yeah. So I think, you know, like this.

1024
02:12:12,790 --> 02:12:17,990
Get. I'm doing.

1025
02:12:20,450 --> 02:12:23,520
Hopefully around the. Other stuff.

1026
02:12:35,410 --> 02:12:42,080
Yeah, because I think it sounds like flourishing and you'll be able to use it just in case her just.

1027
02:12:45,180 --> 02:12:55,200
And then in class. At the high level.

1028
02:13:02,660 --> 02:13:07,139
More than two years. In the last year.

1029
02:13:07,140 --> 02:13:20,900
They didn't this me. I haven't a good idea.

1030
02:13:23,260 --> 02:13:29,260
It's actually pretty good. But I think it'd be really cool.

1031
02:13:32,090 --> 02:13:36,800
In the same year. Washtenaw Community College School.

1032
02:13:39,070 --> 02:13:42,920
This year and next year, we're. Prices different.

1033
02:13:53,350 --> 02:13:56,710
Suffering deep sorrow. Right.

1034
02:13:56,950 --> 02:14:00,790
Right. Right. Yeah. I mean, that would be a really fascinating.

1035
02:14:02,610 --> 02:14:20,750
That geographic overlap. That's not part of those three institutions that are pushing.

1036
02:14:28,240 --> 02:14:33,390
Geographical. Yeah.

1037
02:14:33,510 --> 02:14:48,230
Yeah, yeah. It's interesting that. Yeah.

1038
02:15:08,180 --> 02:15:12,130
That is washing hands. Yeah.

1039
02:15:12,220 --> 02:15:18,780
This is interesting. I found. So when we were reaching out to stakeholders earlier this year for.

1040
02:15:22,540 --> 02:15:36,700
Before talking to. Celebrities like. It's unfortunate because obviously, you know.

1041
02:15:39,910 --> 02:15:43,380
Access stewardship. Everything's wonderful.

1042
02:15:46,610 --> 02:16:08,219
We're going to talk to counselors. Well.

1043
02:16:08,220 --> 02:16:13,270
And I still like he said that if that's the case, then maybe.

1044
02:16:18,410 --> 02:16:44,600
They're just monitor. Very different.

1045
02:16:56,500 --> 02:17:05,650
Yeah, I know that. Yeah, well, and I do.

1046
02:17:05,910 --> 02:17:12,290
You know, it's important. And it is. It's the. You know, the variability is just so.

1047
02:17:17,830 --> 02:17:22,450
I mean, it's like there's nothing everywhere. It's just like variability in comparison to four year.

1048
02:17:24,820 --> 02:17:29,240
Space. That's good.

1049
02:17:29,360 --> 02:17:33,880
That's good. I. That's my.

1050
02:17:35,550 --> 02:17:38,730
The money favors her son is also my great.

1051
02:17:39,440 --> 02:17:45,680
But this kid is a sweet kid. But he's going to think that. At the.

1052
02:17:49,640 --> 02:17:54,490
I have a new style. I like that. And I like it.

1053
02:17:54,740 --> 02:17:57,850
He might be. You felt like it's unfair.

1054
02:17:58,600 --> 02:18:05,210
And there. I'm just picturing like, oh, that's cool, that's cool.

1055
02:18:05,260 --> 02:18:10,490
Yeah, this is what I think.

1056
02:18:10,570 --> 02:18:16,870
But it seems to me that like experience that it's just, you know,

1057
02:18:16,870 --> 02:18:22,030
because I think that with this nice place, like, dropping off my kid because they're on campus.

1058
02:18:24,640 --> 02:18:29,280
I think right now. They're for the high school.

1059
02:18:29,620 --> 02:18:37,020
And then it just kind of go uncertainty verses like and the bigger question is this kind of they're very hesitant to be a pilot.

1060
02:18:37,460 --> 02:18:43,620
And so, you know, it's sort of different. You know, that sort of pressure.

1061
02:18:45,330 --> 02:18:54,070
And I feel like that's just. And I have to on.

1062
02:18:57,120 --> 02:19:00,880
And it's things like, you know. In.

1063
02:19:02,830 --> 02:19:12,290
A student to. Now you know how the German model is.

1064
02:19:16,190 --> 02:19:24,290
No matter what it. So there were other experts for things, but I think there.

1065
02:19:41,510 --> 02:19:47,050
Excellent. Well, yeah, I think.

1066
02:19:48,590 --> 02:19:53,600
Yeah. Yeah, I do. So much for this first semester.

1067
02:19:53,630 --> 02:20:03,890
Oh. Oh, I know.

1068
02:20:03,890 --> 02:20:07,760
Yeah, it's. It's good. I mean, I think the fact that it's classified.

1069
02:20:08,890 --> 02:20:13,070
Is it? But balance health and overall.

1070
02:20:16,490 --> 02:20:21,040
And the applicant. Trying to get.

1071
02:20:28,930 --> 02:20:33,960
But yeah, definitely. I mean, you know, if you're open to whatever.

1072
02:20:33,970 --> 02:20:44,510
But yeah. Yeah.

1073
02:20:44,510 --> 02:20:48,500
I totally understand. Yeah.

1074
02:20:48,510 --> 02:20:56,970
And I think I said I'm trying to. I mean, that's kind of like the speakers were sort of spaced out my research, too, so I just kind.

1075
02:20:58,450 --> 02:21:10,920
It's. Yeah, it's fun. But, you know. I'll see if I could apply for some funding simulation.

1076
02:21:11,280 --> 02:21:16,340
So it's kind of scary. I don't know. But it's fun to do.

1077
02:21:16,590 --> 02:21:20,160
And also chatting with Justin about, like, the prior stuff.

1078
02:21:23,140 --> 02:21:33,670
What to do in the spaces that are. Build it.

1079
02:21:33,690 --> 02:21:43,980
Broader questions to it. But. Yeah.

1080
02:22:03,540 --> 02:22:10,030
Yeah, yeah, yeah. And now, you know, stuff that you're doing next term in terms of classes and everything.

1081
02:22:10,080 --> 02:22:18,090
Are you worried about it? Yeah. What do you kind of like, economy specific?

1082
02:22:18,690 --> 02:22:26,390
So I have an idea of I think the one that I was excited about yesterday were trying to figure out if I could do some sort of.

1083
02:22:31,250 --> 02:22:38,730
The has class and there is. One can find the nursing school, but just as much about it.

1084
02:22:38,740 --> 02:22:42,060
Even time. Figuring out what it felt like my parents taught me.

1085
02:22:53,580 --> 02:23:03,570
She's in reality, just. She's like. She's.

1086
02:23:04,510 --> 02:23:08,860
And so that's something that. What do you feel like? Do you think that's a good idea for.

1087
02:23:12,520 --> 02:23:19,150
I mean, it's like you have like it seems like your mind works that you have experience doing it that nobody.

1088
02:23:21,180 --> 02:23:24,730
That's right. You know, first.

1089
02:23:26,560 --> 02:23:38,700
And, you know, I think that that like it's a sign, you know, it's like that's a sign learning like smart and trial and things.

1090
02:23:40,660 --> 02:23:47,370
It's that stuff. It seems like it's more flexibility and power.

1091
02:23:47,380 --> 02:23:54,940
I think in a lot of ways it teaches like. Expertise to unite certain areas of design and methods to.

1092
02:23:58,750 --> 02:24:08,730
Oh. That's right.

1093
02:24:08,850 --> 02:24:13,080
And I know that you and I talking.

1094
02:24:22,280 --> 02:24:27,840
She is not original. So work.

1095
02:24:29,560 --> 02:24:33,660
So when I was there to continue writing. China is where?

1096
02:24:36,960 --> 02:24:41,940
For her. It's a great. I was 37 and the.

1097
02:24:42,680 --> 02:24:51,120
Sort of the changing direction. And so the new chair of psychiatry, general, she went to the nine divided by 11.

1098
02:24:51,150 --> 02:25:04,410
So some of us went to. Now we'll build on.

1099
02:25:11,630 --> 02:25:26,410
I'm not really sure what they're doing. They knew it was time to and focusing more.

1100
02:25:42,930 --> 02:25:46,770
Program components, a facilitator, someone that can come in and sort of.

1101
02:25:50,330 --> 02:25:56,260
Very unusual, for example, for doctors. Our concern is that every year administrators not.

1102
02:25:57,700 --> 02:26:04,980
The tiny workspace is a beautiful. Private insurance.

1103
02:26:06,670 --> 02:26:10,640
So like a coach, you have that this is how you talk about exposure.

1104
02:26:15,280 --> 02:26:27,840
Programs that frequently process. That doesn't mean that there are other kinds.

1105
02:26:33,510 --> 02:26:41,839
This was definitely, he thought either. Specifically, I think the most useful.

1106
02:26:41,840 --> 02:26:51,670
But some other areas that I know. The visualization of communication made for.

1107
02:26:52,230 --> 02:27:00,310
Policy commentators. This work is actually.

1108
02:27:01,970 --> 02:27:12,440
We're hoping to sort of get a better. Or other.

1109
02:27:15,500 --> 02:27:21,320
Yeah, I know. I mean, it seems like you could use some of those ideas through, like.

1110
02:27:24,320 --> 02:27:29,500
Force or. I mean, I just.

1111
02:27:31,450 --> 02:27:45,700
I mentioned the space or something. Or just, you know, when I.

1112
02:27:52,180 --> 02:28:12,500
Like for. The 11 global mental health.

1113
02:28:16,220 --> 02:28:22,580
It's funny because it's not. In my time.

1114
02:28:25,780 --> 02:28:29,350
But I don't have time. But.

1115
02:28:30,420 --> 02:28:34,510
The folks that. Like.

1116
02:28:35,270 --> 02:28:42,320
I would totally change that. Yeah. If you were to teach.

1117
02:28:49,500 --> 02:28:52,620
But. As far as I'm concerned.

1118
02:28:52,620 --> 02:28:56,650
Half the books that. There's materials that.

1119
02:28:59,280 --> 02:29:05,350
Do you have to, like, share? Critics.

1120
02:29:13,830 --> 02:29:23,010
It happened at the Nasdaq. But I like my personal bias.

1121
02:29:28,980 --> 02:29:31,980
Looking at in particular how the Scottish.

1122
02:29:38,090 --> 02:29:45,240
Yeah. 17 years.

1123
02:29:46,880 --> 02:29:50,240
This here is common for convergence. Here's an this.

1124
02:29:51,110 --> 02:30:00,530
Kind of survey, but survey. I don't think that.

1125
02:30:01,420 --> 02:30:15,860
That's for you to find. Doing in but spirit.

1126
02:30:19,790 --> 02:30:24,540
And I think that also. I.

1127
02:30:36,950 --> 02:30:42,950
Maybe that's see her look like a Zenyatta for everybody who's actually.

1128
02:30:47,510 --> 02:30:53,280
Interesting. You know so I think that I think that what it is that.

1129
02:30:55,250 --> 02:31:00,430
So I you. So much. So me.

1130
02:31:03,660 --> 02:31:11,280
I mean, the policy part. It's worried that.

1131
02:31:12,830 --> 02:31:17,170
Just like for like wrapping up.

1132
02:31:22,220 --> 02:31:29,270
Oh. The. A little bit about the screen, that's all.

1133
02:31:38,080 --> 02:31:48,900
You know, there are certain things, you know, in that space. But on your. I know enough about policy and that's not going.

1134
02:31:54,650 --> 02:31:59,490
Right? Right. It's important. But also, like could hear from policy.

1135
02:32:05,910 --> 02:32:13,840
Testifying. Think the stakeholders have something stretched.

1136
02:32:15,750 --> 02:32:20,720
When? When I ready to residents we.

1137
02:32:23,510 --> 02:32:41,230
It helps me to have a few more minutes. Right.

1138
02:32:41,780 --> 02:32:46,930
So in a sense, layman and I think about this sometimes and again, like every.

1139
02:32:57,790 --> 02:33:03,650
But it also makes me think about. During the next five years.

1140
02:33:05,470 --> 02:33:13,500
So much content to expertise. And so I feel like when you're like, wow, this is like my faith.

1141
02:33:13,500 --> 02:33:17,670
And that's like where your your answer.

1142
02:33:22,530 --> 02:33:26,070
Here's what can you tell us about mental health space?

1143
02:33:26,830 --> 02:33:30,570
Here are the gaps in your. So.

1144
02:33:34,210 --> 02:33:44,050
It's like giving. Policy. Unless you.

1145
02:33:45,800 --> 02:33:51,990
For the policy. Yeah.

1146
02:33:53,220 --> 02:34:00,100
And you can get stake and things like that in the building the.

1147
02:34:03,110 --> 02:34:06,630
And could. Wonder.

1148
02:34:07,040 --> 02:34:17,550
I don't know that that new insurance. That's what major, major policy plans.

1149
02:34:18,320 --> 02:34:21,340
What? But.

1150
02:34:22,700 --> 02:34:31,060
It like a faculty fellowship that. Two years ago, I was like, Oh, I can't do that.

1151
02:34:32,980 --> 02:34:39,460
I can't do this. So. They have.

1152
02:34:41,120 --> 02:34:45,870
And things. And then there's also like know how. Of course, here like goes.

1153
02:34:50,350 --> 02:34:54,380
Certainly it's for people like. You didn't pick up on it.

1154
02:34:56,870 --> 02:35:04,150
And I don't. Probably that that's a very targeted way.

1155
02:35:04,430 --> 02:35:08,530
Of course, I think that that feels.

1156
02:35:09,390 --> 02:35:15,370
All three of which, like for. Like. Yeah.

1157
02:35:15,580 --> 02:35:24,740
It's just sort of say. Talked about it. You know.

1158
02:35:26,420 --> 02:35:30,830
Community colleges. Crises.

1159
02:35:31,770 --> 02:35:34,790
Teens and adolescents with. Michael.

1160
02:35:37,710 --> 02:35:41,690
Now that's a bad. Would you? So why?

1161
02:35:42,080 --> 02:35:50,480
All right. That would be so cool, you know?

1162
02:35:50,620 --> 02:35:55,350
And I think so. I think all of that is also to say. I can totally see.

1163
02:36:01,470 --> 02:36:05,270
She gave her. Yeah.

1164
02:36:05,590 --> 02:36:14,500
Yeah, yeah. Like. Oh, it was quite a surprise.

1165
02:36:17,180 --> 02:36:21,010
Right. That video.

1166
02:36:24,010 --> 02:36:27,710
It's not something that I. But.

1167
02:36:30,480 --> 02:36:34,350
That. And so especially during this time we.

1168
02:36:35,560 --> 02:36:39,150
Things are clear now. You know what's happening in the lives now.

1169
02:36:41,900 --> 02:36:45,930
Seven people have. Having.

1170
02:36:53,880 --> 02:36:58,540
Yeah, I think so. Know I used try.

1171
02:37:01,250 --> 02:37:18,430
I mean. For a trial.

1172
02:37:19,090 --> 02:37:22,320
They should figure out how to do that.

1173
02:37:23,290 --> 02:37:27,520
Yeah. Is that. Now, is that the one that you've been involved with?

1174
02:37:29,010 --> 02:37:33,380
We're running. High school.

1175
02:37:44,300 --> 02:37:47,750
It is very, very good, Mary.

1176
02:37:48,530 --> 02:37:51,950
Yeah. But I think it's especially.

1177
02:37:54,320 --> 02:38:04,730
Waste of research dollars. Use of taxpayer money.

1178
02:38:13,710 --> 02:38:21,190
So I think that's one. You know the value to shore up your.

1179
02:38:24,110 --> 02:38:28,760
And Yeah. It's a chance to cut through some of those things.

1180
02:38:28,770 --> 02:38:32,630
Quite. Their coursework.

1181
02:38:48,830 --> 02:38:54,250
And I think. Her clients were sent away.

1182
02:38:55,260 --> 02:38:58,930
Ignorance? Absolutely. Yeah. Just do that.

1183
02:39:00,950 --> 02:39:07,690
You're not going to make like a place like that. Oh, no. I thought it was funny I was working at.

1184
02:39:12,650 --> 02:39:21,880
So good. So good to see how much better. That would be kind of fun.

1185
02:39:22,810 --> 02:39:26,170
You know, like, like this teaching presentation.

1186
02:39:26,170 --> 02:39:29,580
Like one of the things that sometimes it's like. There's a skill.

1187
02:39:29,600 --> 02:39:35,470
I have an understanding of it, and that can be a good one to take.

1188
02:39:36,920 --> 02:39:45,400
And I have copy. This is 100% license like all these things.

1189
02:39:45,700 --> 02:39:51,410
So I think early on time. I just emerged from that.

1190
02:39:51,650 --> 02:39:55,310
Like, now I'm going to pull this together.

1191
02:39:55,850 --> 02:40:01,380
People are going to sit down. It's.

1192
02:40:04,700 --> 02:40:13,730
Sensing Ken's observation, you talk to them like that ever since I was around the time I to.

1193
02:40:16,800 --> 02:40:20,780
These are the classes that we've been thinking about just for the semester.

1194
02:40:20,820 --> 02:40:25,790
Eddie Miranda, actually. This one, I.

1195
02:40:28,670 --> 02:40:33,620
Oh, yeah. One. I think we're going to.

1196
02:40:34,470 --> 02:40:48,470
At the moment. Here. Sorry. Social work here. You know, it's you know, I think it's really nice for me.

1197
02:40:49,260 --> 02:40:52,300
Yeah. Yeah, especially for me. And I know I love it.

1198
02:40:52,310 --> 02:41:01,730
And then. I'm spoken to quality with the prices.

1199
02:41:05,340 --> 02:41:12,600
To the truth and nothing more. I can tell. I really want to that.

1200
02:41:16,840 --> 02:41:23,170
I could be wrong. Life if you've done.

1201
02:41:24,770 --> 02:41:45,480
Together. Chelsea.

1202
02:41:56,220 --> 02:42:25,660
It, basically. I thought we had some talks.

1203
02:42:25,960 --> 02:42:29,500
Yeah, there's a lot. You.

1204
02:42:45,800 --> 02:42:51,600
Two of their options are. Yes, I'm. And I just.

1205
02:42:53,670 --> 02:42:58,580
Visualization application software, O'Brien said, using our.

1206
02:43:02,760 --> 02:43:05,800
You really? Just be practical.

1207
02:43:06,770 --> 02:43:11,820
Yeah. Know. So those are some of the things that are that's restricting their.

1208
02:43:16,040 --> 02:43:22,420
Well, I wasn't sitting. And that was the deal out there.

1209
02:43:26,010 --> 02:43:33,340
Joe Biden. Yeah.

1210
02:43:37,990 --> 02:43:47,170
Family. She worked with us for the first time around.

1211
02:43:52,040 --> 02:43:55,370
That's a beautiful thing. We think about.

1212
02:43:59,890 --> 02:44:05,970
Getting. In a sense that I felt that. One of the things that we did that our members.

1213
02:44:17,380 --> 02:44:33,470
Yeah. They're just.

1214
02:44:37,740 --> 02:44:42,360
Just like that. And they do.

1215
02:44:51,700 --> 02:45:09,710
There's. Dana.

1216
02:45:10,860 --> 02:45:21,920
His eyes on it, you know, and I think that. For the younger population.

1217
02:45:22,870 --> 02:45:26,780
Yeah, exactly. Because I want to get more results. Yeah.

1218
02:45:27,020 --> 02:45:35,510
Yeah, I think that would be. And it was like class and I think be was.

1219
02:45:37,210 --> 02:45:41,630
The stuff that I think Brian wrote. I think I actually called him.

1220
02:45:41,630 --> 02:45:44,990
So it's funny, I didn't realize this, but I spent a lot of the article.

1221
02:45:44,990 --> 02:45:48,850
But I'm certain that this. Since that point about.

1222
02:45:50,900 --> 02:46:02,320
It's kind of like to have worn out things. Oh, I didn't realize that because I realized that even I was like this before I was.

1223
02:46:02,570 --> 02:46:08,150
So I think that. Okay, so you could do that once and then.

1224
02:46:09,190 --> 02:46:16,040
How many? So I have to do it.

1225
02:46:17,750 --> 02:46:52,120
Of course you. Yeah.

1226
02:46:52,530 --> 02:46:56,290
Yeah, there are. But I think if I had to drive something.

1227
02:47:03,910 --> 02:47:08,920
Yeah I think they were also contact our fans at.

1228
02:47:10,540 --> 02:47:16,620
I didn't know her name, but she's a. Well, that that's.

1229
02:47:21,140 --> 02:47:25,760
Registering and getting into the class without serious.

1230
02:47:27,620 --> 02:47:37,670
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I do know Brian. Are there other?

1231
02:47:48,310 --> 02:47:53,480
Yeah. Yeah, definitely with. And I would say that also within that.

1232
02:48:01,870 --> 02:48:09,300
It's been hard to. I think I would be hard to translate since I'm not as interested in political school and medical work.

1233
02:48:09,330 --> 02:48:16,220
Okay. I think it. But I. Based on this question are.

1234
02:48:24,150 --> 02:48:33,640
So I wasn't sure how. So.

1235
02:48:36,800 --> 02:48:42,600
Means. Who decides science classes.

1236
02:48:46,100 --> 02:48:54,290
I think. Oh, look who.

1237
02:48:59,160 --> 02:49:03,710
I think that is one of. Unfortunately that.

1238
02:49:13,450 --> 02:49:18,470
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

1239
02:49:18,690 --> 02:49:25,790
And at was. Famous stamp.

1240
02:49:27,690 --> 02:50:07,230
Just to give you a sense. She's.

1241
02:50:24,790 --> 02:50:29,290
He was a pieces. Look, I'm just.

1242
02:50:54,570 --> 02:50:58,860
Like Masters Grant. But.

1243
02:51:00,050 --> 02:51:03,430
Yes, she says.

1244
02:51:06,790 --> 02:51:32,999
I mean, it sounds. There's a family.

1245
02:51:33,000 --> 02:51:44,640
There's another man that. I.

1246
02:51:47,170 --> 02:52:07,790
But. Yeah.

1247
02:52:07,810 --> 02:52:11,650
And I think that's one thing that we shouldn't be talking about, but.

1248
02:52:17,750 --> 02:52:21,260
It's like it's on fire, you know? Oh, there's nothing.

1249
02:52:28,400 --> 02:52:31,700
What's your back? Yeah. Yeah. So I think that's.

1250
02:52:31,720 --> 02:52:39,690
That's going to be. So that's the same kind of.

1251
02:52:53,200 --> 02:53:00,200
Yeah. But it's more than that massive imposter syndrome.

1252
02:53:00,740 --> 02:53:20,630
And. I don't know.

1253
02:53:21,840 --> 02:53:25,080
Yeah. Yeah. I think that should be the first thing has to.

1254
02:53:28,970 --> 02:53:34,420
I was texting, right? I.

1255
02:53:35,390 --> 02:53:41,570
Yeah, I just talked about the you. So I totally understand.

1256
02:53:48,020 --> 02:53:51,560
But I think that's part of the reason why.

1257
02:53:54,090 --> 02:54:00,060
Now that have come out here to see.

1258
02:54:06,230 --> 02:54:13,490
Never. Never been a philosophy project.

1259
02:54:13,760 --> 02:54:18,820
I've always had. In the morning. So I had it in my arms.

1260
02:54:22,780 --> 02:54:35,980
She's a. Lot more money.

1261
02:54:45,090 --> 02:54:50,550
Yeah. I'm sorry to do that.

1262
02:54:57,820 --> 02:55:03,830
But I think. Favorite session I.

1263
02:55:13,620 --> 02:55:18,060
To try to prevent.

1264
02:55:21,270 --> 02:55:35,870
Around the detention center during the first. Well, it's something I've thought about a lot, but.

1265
02:55:43,300 --> 02:55:47,110
I know that there are people who think so, but.

1266
02:55:50,280 --> 02:55:57,140
Certainly this should be. Of course that's.

1267
02:55:58,850 --> 02:56:03,090
I. Okay. Then there's this link I on Thursday.

1268
02:56:07,510 --> 02:56:17,960
I think it's common, but. So.

1269
02:56:18,190 --> 02:56:22,400
So that's how it was.

1270
02:56:23,730 --> 02:56:27,590
Yeah. Yeah. And I pulled in.

1271
02:56:27,590 --> 02:56:31,480
Brian. Like environmental health.

1272
02:56:36,820 --> 02:56:40,900
Better. Parents and stakeholders.

1273
02:56:47,080 --> 02:56:53,720
Which is a funny thing. So.

1274
02:56:55,100 --> 02:56:59,890
Yeah. Just. Be patient around our issues.

1275
02:57:01,220 --> 02:57:10,610
That's an important. And as.

1276
02:57:14,030 --> 02:57:21,660
Kind of. But.

1277
02:57:22,860 --> 02:57:38,800
So that's. And you know how they talk to me.

1278
02:57:41,580 --> 02:57:47,450
It was like a role playing between a pair of two parents. I'm not splitting.

1279
02:57:47,480 --> 02:57:53,900
Do you have any unlocked arms? This is not an embarrassing question to ask, but it could save your child's life.

1280
02:57:54,320 --> 02:57:58,840
Signatures seem like they're just. He gets an exemption.

1281
02:58:00,340 --> 02:58:06,160
Oh, that is so sweet. Very exciting because you've been talking about this a lot.

1282
02:58:06,230 --> 02:58:12,680
So. That like that is one area.

1283
02:58:35,930 --> 02:58:44,460
Bernadette Peters in. It's an exciting.

1284
02:58:46,400 --> 02:59:01,980
I'm going to be really, really mad. When you walked in my mind.

1285
02:59:02,190 --> 02:59:06,720
We will see. We will see. So. All right. Well, thank you so much for.

1286
02:59:08,010 --> 02:59:12,690
People. But I. Yeah.

1287
02:59:12,750 --> 02:59:15,790
The question is not 100% grievous, that sort of thing.

1288
02:59:17,590 --> 02:59:24,130
But if you can help me think through this. I'm always happy to have my views on ideas.

1289
02:59:26,560 --> 02:59:29,860
So. Yeah. Yeah. He posted. Yeah. Well, that.

1290
02:59:31,940 --> 02:59:42,280
Yeah. There are some opportunities to work on stuff that would be fun, but sometimes that is going to flip our like that.

1291
02:59:42,290 --> 02:59:49,580
But. Well.

1292
02:59:50,800 --> 02:59:55,610
I feel like Trump. Right.
