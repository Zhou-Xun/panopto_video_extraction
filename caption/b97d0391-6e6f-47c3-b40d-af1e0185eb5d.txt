1
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:13,590
How many of you have unlimited time and money? It's certainly not me.

2
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:21,720
If you think about the idea of sampling for how exposure and outcome relate to one another in a population,

3
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:27,300
you might think it would be ideal to collect data on every member of that population.

4
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,550
Of course, the amount of time and money that that would take is simply impossible.

5
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:39,750
In fact, it's one of the reasons that I really enjoy the study of epidemiology is that we're quite resourceful

6
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,810
in situations when there's just not enough resources to make what we want an ideal setting happen.

7
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:53,100
One of the key parts of our skill set is to know how to sample a population efficiently so that

8
00:00:53,100 --> 00:01:00,690
we can use less resources but still get accurate answers of the truth in the full population.

9
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:06,840
In this particular video, what I'm going to talk you through is something that's called selection bias.

10
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:16,530
Selection bias happens when our sample of the population does not get us the same answer as if we collected data on everyone.

11
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:23,310
So as part of this video, we're going to talk about how we have our goals so that we avoid selection bias.

12
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:28,230
We're going to talk about understanding where sources of selection bias happen.

13
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:38,220
Identify a situation that's likely to induce selection bias, and talk about how we can predict the directionality when we do have selection bias.

14
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:44,280
So to best understand why and when selection bias happens,

15
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:51,120
let's start first with the idea of what data we would have if we could sample everyone in that population.

16
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:58,750
So imagine some full population where people can be basically classified as exposed or unexposed here

17
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:07,170
shown as E being exposure or e bar being non exposure as well as their disease status being D or D bar.

18
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:14,460
As you probably recall from earlier lectures, folks who fall within the A or the desal shown here,

19
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:24,330
meaning exposed and sick or unexposed and healthy, are the ones that help us to understand that exposure is likely to cause more of our outcome.

20
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:36,360
In contrast, people who fall in cells B and C, meaning that there's exposure and no disease or no exposure and disease,

21
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:44,760
are in support of a protective association between exposure and health, meaning the more exposure you have, the better your health will be.

22
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:52,500
Now, due to budgetary and time constraints, we cannot collect all people in the population.

23
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:58,920
In other words, we're just unable to get every single person in A, B, C and D sampled.

24
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:10,440
So what we do instead is we aim to collect some subset of the population here being A not, B, not, C, not and D not.

25
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:15,690
That will reflect the true associations in the full population.

26
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:27,840
So long as we're collecting equal fractions of people in each cell, say like 20%, then we would expect to have balanced sampling frequencies,

27
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:33,510
effectively making sure that our groups are sampled equally and therefore will

28
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:38,220
get an accurate estimate of the true association in the underlying population.

29
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:43,790
Now trouble sets in if when we're sampling a population,

30
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:51,900
there's some sort of uneven capture of the source population that distorts the distribution of exposure by disease status,

31
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:57,630
either because the way we recruit people or because of the way that we retain them into the study.

32
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:07,950
So here, as an example, you can see that we've successfully sampled 20% of the population in the B, the C and the D cells.

33
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:09,270
However,

34
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:21,150
the population A is only sampled at a 10% rate because we now have fewer individuals who are both exposed and with our disease or our outcome.

35
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:27,389
What that's going to do is that's going to under represent the a cell in our equation.

36
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:32,880
It's going to under represent the number of people who have the exposure and the outcome.

37
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:42,840
It's going to make it look as if that exposure is less harmful for health than it is in actuality, to some extent or to some of you.

38
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:47,580
It may be easier just to think about that as a concept for others.

39
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:52,860
It may be helpful to look at the math like what I have on the right hand side of the slide here.

40
00:04:52,860 --> 00:05:01,049
You can see that if I had a 10% sampling frequency for a but a 20% sampling frequency for B,

41
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:07,530
C and D, I would wind up with an odds ratio for the association between exposure and outcome.

42
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,190
That's only half of what I would see in the full population.

43
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:19,470
The same would actually be true if we under sampled individuals who are both unexposed and without disease.

44
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:30,120
Again, for exactly the same logic. This type of person is a type of person who supports the association that exposure or causes more of our outcome.

45
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:36,510
So again, with fewer people falling in the D cell than what is really, truly there in the population,

46
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:45,120
we would underestimate the true association between exposure and disease in our study population as compared to the full population.

47
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:55,830
Now, of course, you could think about how the opposite might occur if we under sampled people who had no exposure but did have disease,

48
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:01,050
or we under sampled those people with exposure and had no disease,

49
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:08,280
then what we would do is we would wind up biasing our estimate to large because in effect,

50
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:15,180
we've sampled too few of the people who support the fact that exposure causes less disease,

51
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:21,270
thereby inflating our observed odds ratio of our sample population.

52
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:29,520
With respect to the truth. Now, each of these scenarios that I described reflect what's called selection bias.

53
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:38,340
Selection bias occurs when individuals who are selected or retained in a study produce this distorted estimate of association.

54
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:44,269
That would be a. Served in the full population. Very importantly,

55
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:49,940
the introduction of selection bias into a study only occurs if the recruitment or

56
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:55,670
the retention of study participant depends on both the exposure and the disease.

57
00:06:56,450 --> 00:07:01,850
Here you can see that if individuals who are exposed are less likely to participate,

58
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:10,100
but that participation rate does not vary by disease status, then I would not expect to see bias of my associations.

59
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:18,110
Similarly, if those who are disease are less likely to participate, but that participation does not vary by exposure status.

60
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:23,540
Then again, I would expect to see no bias. Therefore,

61
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:29,389
just adding to the definition of selection bias selection bias occurs when the selection

62
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:35,540
or retention of participants is related to both the exposure and the disease status.

63
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:43,320
To help drive home the point about selection bias and really get a better sense as to what's happening.

64
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,870
Let's look at a real world example here.

65
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:51,650
I'm going to talk you through an example research question which asks whether or not

66
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:57,080
there are associations between helmet use and severe injuries among motorcyclists.

67
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:05,280
Imagine first that we have data from a prospective cohort study in the prospective cohort design.

68
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:10,259
We recruit motorcyclists at the start. We then ask them about helmet use.

69
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:14,940
Do you wear one, do you not, and follow them over time for severe injuries?

70
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:22,560
Using this design, we obtain the following data and estimate an odds ratio of 0.48.

71
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:30,840
This suggests that people who are wearing helmets are more than half as likely as those without helmets to experience severe injuries.

72
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:37,770
Now let's say we asked the same exact question, but this time we conducted a case control study.

73
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:45,900
Now what we do is we recruit people who've suffered serious injuries in motorcycle crashes and motorcyclists without injuries.

74
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:52,350
We then ask them about their previous helmet use. Using this design, we have new data.

75
00:08:52,440 --> 00:09:02,130
We now find an odds ratio of 0.65, suggesting that motorcycle helmets are far less protective than what we observed before.

76
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:11,640
So what's happening here? What happened was selection bias in comparing the two tables of data directly.

77
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:19,230
What you'll notice is that we failed to capture many of the individuals with severe injury in the case control study.

78
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:29,640
So why is that? Well, a subset of people who experience a severe injury and a motorcycle crash will actually wind up dying of their injuries.

79
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:37,590
In the first study, we can actually capture those people who die of their motorcycle injuries in our design.

80
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:45,630
But in the second study, we've inherently subset our population to people with serious injury who have survived that crash.

81
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:52,440
If wearing helmets helps to prevent people from getting fatal injuries and serious crashes,

82
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:58,670
then what we do expect is to lose fewer of the people in cell A than in cell C,

83
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:08,670
just like what we see here, by losing so many people in cell C, what we have is an impact of inflating the observed odds ratio.

84
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:20,100
Going back to our previous imagery, what you can see is that we have similar sampling frequencies in the two studies for both cells B and D.

85
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:30,510
But in the case control study, we're collecting, say, about 80% of the people who fall in cell A, but only 60% of those who fall in cell C.

86
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:38,700
This imbalance of selection by both our exposure and our outcome creates the selection bias that we're worried about.

87
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:43,620
So there you have it. You've now learned about selection bias.

88
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:49,260
Recall that selection bias occurs when individuals were selected or retained in a study,

89
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:54,360
produced a distorted estimate of the association that would be observed in the full source population.

90
00:10:55,050 --> 00:11:04,560
Very importantly, selection bias happens when there's this imbalance, and sampling frequency is based on both the exposure and the outcome of study.
