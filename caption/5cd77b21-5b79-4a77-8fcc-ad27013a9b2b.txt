1
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:07,920
In this section, we're going to be talking about social support.

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:15,150
And this is kind of in the fourth of the different dimensions that we've been talking about,

3
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:23,540
the essential skills for personal professional well-being. And I think a lot of times we think about mental health we think about us as an individual and

4
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:29,990
how do we pursue our mental health? And so we often don't talk about our social support.

5
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:41,260
Our squad, but often times we are only going to be as well as our social support is healthy.

6
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:43,660
And so let's talk about this a little bit more.

7
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:54,740
I really like the example one of the actresses from Black Panther she talked about her fears, the actress who played Okoye, being her vibranium.

8
00:00:54,740 --> 00:01:03,300
And even if you think about in that film, if you saw it, there is this scene where Black Panther is

9
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:11,060
fighting and about to lose and then his mom and his sister are cheering him on and it's almost like he gets another boost

10
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:17,300
of energy and is able to fight and win and then eventually has another fight and he loses.

11
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:28,070
But it's only because other people find him, take care of him, nurse him back to health, that he ends up going on and being able to be this big hero.

12
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:34,780
So his social support is huge. If you watch any of the more recent

13
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:42,510
Avenger movie is it's like each of them is only as strong as their squad because there's a moments where they're not doing great

14
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:48,550
and then everybody else shows up things turn out OK. So we need to know and normalize that

15
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:54,860
social support is a huge part of our mental health and well-being.

16
00:01:54,860 --> 00:02:00,980
Another concept that kind of goes with this is the idea of resilience. So we're often taught about resilience

17
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:07,730
as if it was an individualistic thing. So I am either resilient or I'm not.

18
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:14,040
And Resmaa Menakem, he's recently written a book.

19
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,490
Talking a lot about collective problems, collective strengths.

20
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:22,020
And one of the things that he says is that resilience is really something that kind of moves between us.

21
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:30,330
It's shared. And if any of you, like you've been with a big group of friends, you know that their mood around you

22
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:36,420
you can really borrow energy from it and feel amped up. Also, their mood can really take energy away from you.

23
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:43,090
And so we want to have kind of like a root system.

24
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:47,890
That we can share strength and energy with each other when we need it.

25
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:53,440
And where we're having a positive overall impact on each other.

26
00:02:53,440 --> 00:03:01,050
And we also want to have as much as possible a robust social support.

27
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:05,040
So as I said in many other videos, we want it to be like a hammock

28
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,300
there's a lot of people that are helping us, and we also support them.

29
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:15,480
And that it's not that it's just us solo or just have like one person.

30
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:22,320
Because if that person isn't available or that person is going through a hard time, it's not really setting us up to have as much support.

31
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:28,760
We want to have a support system. But the next question becomes, are we utilizing it?

32
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:33,200
This has a lot to do with how do you feel about asking for help?

33
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:41,920
How do you feel about needing support, because we all do. And so are you talking to people when you have

34
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,740
Are you letting them know? Are you asking for help?

35
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:54,010
Because that's gonna be really an important part of performing well over the long term, but also feeling well over the long term.

36
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:58,960
So this diagram kind of shows us some of the things that we're looking for

37
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:06,780
in a healthy social support system. So we want our friends and the people that are close to us in our squad to hold us accountable.

38
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:15,960
Let us know when they see us having a hard time, when they see us kind of veering off of our values.

39
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:21,150
We want them to do that in a caring and loving way, but we want to know that they're telling us the truth.

40
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:23,740
The important things that we need to hear.

41
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:33,630
We want it to be safe both physically and emotionally, we don't want people to tearing us down or putting us in dangerous situations.

42
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:43,310
Know that people being honest, that they're not lying to us and manipulating us, deceiving us, that we can trust that what they say is what they mean.

43
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:47,160
We want them to be supportive. And that there's kind of give and take in support.

44
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:52,130
We'll talk more about all of these things as we move through this. Cooperation,

45
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:56,340
we want them to have this mentality that we're all cheering for each other,

46
00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:07,590
that there is enough room for us all to be successful. There's no reason for stealing people's ideas, being hyper competitive.

47
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:12,480
We want there to be trust. We'll talk more about that means and what that looks like.

48
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:20,620
We often say we want to trust people, but if we haven't experienced that or if it's missing, it can kind of be hard to figure out

49
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:24,850
how to build it? I want you to think about these these different dimensions.

50
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:29,580
Is this what your relationships look like when you kind of look at the people closest to you

51
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:34,870
your squad is are these ingredients there.

52
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:45,720
Is it a hammock or are there is there enough social support or do you need to really work on building the having more trusted people in your life?

53
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:50,480
You know, do you have people who can mentor you and give you information, do you have people who can help you solve problems?

54
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:57,710
Do you have people who you can talk to about emotional and personal things.

55
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:04,450
And are you utilizing them. These are the things to think about. In the following sections we're going to get more into

56
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:11,650
how do you build healthy relationships? How do you build trust. How do you communicate? How do you have healthy boundaries?

57
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:19,250
Because those are all of the skills that you need once you kind of get a squad to make it healthy, keep it healthy.

58
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,840
We'll continue this conversation
