00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Injury, Part three poisonings in the first segment of this lecture redefined intentional

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and unintentional injuries and looked at the major causes of injuries.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
In the second segment, we examined injuries and deaths related to motor vehicles.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:34,000
In this segment, we'll focus and focus on poisonings or overdoses as a major cause of injury deaths.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Total poisoning or overdose deaths exceeded seventy five thousand in 2017,

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:49,000
with the vast majority being unintentional, almost all intentional poisoning deaths were suicides.

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Five percent of poisoning deaths occurred in circumstances in which it was not possible to determine the intent of the victim.

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:09,000
This lecture segment will focus on unintentional poisonings or overdoses.

9
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The death rate from poisonings or overdoses has increased steadily for most of the last 20 or 25 years.

10
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The overall rate has more than doubled in this time period.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Opioids are the single largest category of drugs related to overdose deaths, and they have shown a similar pattern of increase.

12
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:39,000
However, though not shown in this graph, the number and rate of overdose deaths in 2018 declined somewhat from the peak in twenty seventeen.

13
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:50,000
In the next few slides, we will examine a number of demographic factors in relation to overdose deaths.

14
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:02,000
These two graphs display drug overdose deaths in the United States by age and by sex for the decade from 2007 to twenty seventeen.

15
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Age is a particularly important factor in overdose deaths, but the pattern is a bit unusual.

16
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Young people under the age of 25 and people 65 and older have the lowest death rates.

17
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It is middle aged people who have the highest rates of death from overdoses, particularly those between 45 and 54 years old.

18
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Also, the overdose death rate in men is much higher.

19
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:41,000
More than double the rate among women overall. And notably, the death rates among middle age men began to climb more steeply in 2013.

20
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:49,000
We will look at that again in the future.

21
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:58,000
This graph displays the trends in drug overdose death rates by race and ethnicity in the United States for the period from 1999 to 2015.

22
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:10,000
In 1999, the overdose death rates were approximately the same for all three racial and ethnic groups as they had been for many years before.

23
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:20,000
But then they began to diverge. The overdose death rate among non Hispanic whites climbed steadily for the next 20 years.

24
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:27,000
The rate for non Hispanic blacks also climbed significantly. But much less, though, than among whites.

25
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:36,000
And the rate of overdose deaths among Hispanics remained flat for most of this period, with only a slight increase in the most recent years.

26
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Clearly, race and ethnicity have been for important factors in the drug epidemic.

27
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
But the story is different in these circumstance, in this circumstance.

28
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Non Hispanic whites, particularly middle aged men, have borne the brunt of the opioid epidemic.

29
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,000
The impact of this pattern of mortality has been substantial during the latter half of the last decade

30
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:09,000
of the United States had an unprecedented decline in life expectancy among middle aged white adults.

31
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:19,000
This decline was largely but not solely driven by drug poisoning deaths.

32
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:26,000
As noted previously, opioids account for the majority of drug overdose deaths in the United States.

33
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Other important categories of drugs involved in overdose deaths include psychostimulant such as methamphetamines,

34
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:46,000
benzodiazepines such as Valium and various anti-depressants as can be seen from the graph from nineteen ninety nine to about 2010.

35
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
The primary underlying cause for the increase in opioid overdose deaths was related

36
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:59,000
to increased deaths from medically prescribed opioids such as hydrocodone.

37
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,000
There was no significant increase in drug deaths from use of illegal drugs such as heroin.

38
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Prior to 2010, and though not shown in this graph, the same absence of increase was true for other drug categories.

39
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:21,000
During this time period, that is related to stimulants, benzodiazepines and anti-depressants.

40
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:32,000
However, in about 2010, things began to change, with a dramatic increase in heroin overdose deaths each year until 2016, when they leveled off.

41
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Even more dramatic has been the rise in overdose deaths related to synthetic opioids such as fentanyl.

42
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Beginning in about 2013, an important question is what caused the overdose deaths for these different

43
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
drug categories to change so dramatically and so differently from each other?

44
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:01,000
And are they related? We will address these questions in subsequent slides.

45
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:09,000
This slide provides an international comparison of overdose deaths in the United States with all European countries.

46
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Note that some of the curves for the European countries are labeled, but many are not.

47
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Since at least 2005,

48
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:27,000
the United States has had one of the highest and at times the highest rate of deaths from overdoses compared to all European countries.

49
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It is also interesting to point out that in some countries, such as Germany,

50
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:42,000
not only has the death rate been consistently lower than the United States, but also that there was no significant increase over the same time period.

51
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:56,000
In contrast, some countries, such as Scotland, have experienced a similar dramatic increase in overdose deaths in recent years.

52
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:03,000
The preceding slides have illustrated how large and persistent the problem of overdose deaths has become in the United States.

53
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
An obvious question is why or how did this happen?

54
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:15,000
The most significant pattern from the previous slides is the dramatic increase in overdose deaths since the 1990s.

55
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
This increase had a number of major immediate causes.

56
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Initially, the increase in overdose deaths was driven by overdoses related to use of prescription opioid pain relievers.

57
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,000
This involved both drugs that were prescribed to patients who then overdosed on the pills that were

58
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:42,000
prescribed to them and also use a prescription opioid pain pills that had been diverted illegally.

59
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Later, as we have seen, there was a surge in overdose deaths related to illegal drugs,

60
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:56,000
initially involving heroin and then driven by use of synthetic opioids such as fentanyl.

61
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:02,000
A consistent observation has been that past misuse of prescription opioids is

62
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
the strongest risk factor for initiation of heroin and other illegal drugs.

63
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Furthermore, during this time period,

64
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:19,000
the street price of heroin declined and the purity went up so it became cheaper to use heroin than to use prescription opioid pain pills.

65
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:26,000
This was likely a major driving force for the increase in heroin use and deaths.

66
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Another factor that helps to explain the increased mortality from overdoses is the much higher potency of synthetic opioids.

67
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Fentanyl is about 50 times more potent than heroin, and car fentanyl is estimated to be 100 hundred times stronger than fentanyl.

68
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Use of such potent drugs is far riskier to users, since very small errors in dosage can lead to a fatal outcome.

69
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:08,000
So if we look upstream, one can ask, why did use or abuse of prescription painkillers increase in the 90s or early 2000s?

70
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Well, a major factor was that the number or rate of opioid related prescriptions increased dramatically during this period.

71
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:33,000
So, again, looking further upstream, why did doctors change their pattern of prescribing pain medications and write so many prescriptions?

72
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:39,000
This is a bit more complicated. Historically, prior to the 1980s,

73
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:49,000
opioid painkillers were rarely prescribed for what is described as chronic non cancer pain because of the fear of addiction.

74
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
And many states had laws or regulations that prevented such use.

75
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
During the 1980s, there were a couple of small and in retrospect,

76
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:10,000
very poor quality studies that allegedly showed that the risk of addiction with use of opioids for chronic non cancer pain was very low.

77
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Furthermore, there was research that showed that chronic pain was often undertreated by clinicians,

78
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:24,000
hospitals and organizations that set treatment guidelines for clinicians such as the Joint Commission for Hospital Accreditation,

79
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:33,000
which accredits most hospitals in the United States, pushed for pain to be identified as the fifth vital sign,

80
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
along with temperature, respirations, blood pressure and pulse.

81
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:44,000
States also relaxed regulations that restricted the use of opioids on top of all these changes.

82
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Historically, most clinicians have had very little training in the management of acute or chronic pain

83
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,000
and therefore little training in the use and management of opioids to control such pain.

84
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
In addition, some patients engage in what is called drug seeking behavior,

85
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,000
such as trying to obtain prescriptions for pain pills from multiple doctors simultaneously.

86
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:17,000
And there was an increase in the diversion of prescription medications for illegal use at the wholesale level.

87
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Finally, another major factor that has come to light in the last few years is the conscious role that pharmaceutical companies have played,

88
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:34,000
such as by marketing their products as safe to physicians and to get them to write more prescriptions.

89
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Think OxyContin. Also,

90
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:44,000
there was a failure on the part of pharmaceutical companies to properly monitor the shipment of product such as shipping millions

91
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:57,000
of pills to small communities that could not possibly have a legitimate clinical need for painkillers of that magnitude.

92
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,000
So in thinking about the causes both upstream and downstream, in recent years,

93
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:08,000
there have been a number of steps that have been taken to reduce deaths from drug overdoses.

94
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Doctors now get more training and or are required to take continuing education

95
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:20,000
classes on pain management and prescription of pain medications in many states,

96
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:29,000
including Michigan. It is now the law that before doctor can write a prescription for opioids or other controlled substances,

97
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
they are required to check the state of Michigan online database of all patients

98
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
who have obtained such prescriptions and to record their patient in the database.

99
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:48,000
This mechanism serves to prevent patients from obtaining drug prescriptions from multiple providers simultaneously.

100
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Some states severely limit the amount of pain medication that most clinicians are allowed to prescribe.

101
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:02,000
And if a patient requires long term pain medication, they must be evaluated by a pain specialist.

102
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:09,000
The CDC has issued new guidelines for prescribing opioids, particularly for chronic non cancer pain.

103
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
The opioid antagonist Naloxone has become more widely available.

104
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Naloxone blocks the adverse effects of opioids such as respiratory depression, sedation and low blood pressure.

105
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:30,000
The locks on can be administered intranasal early by nonmedical professionals to help prevent death in the event of an overdose.

106
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Many states have increased access to treatment for addiction, and notably, such treatment is covered under the Affordable Care Act.

107
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Overdose deaths have been the leading cause of intentional or excuse me,

108
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,000
unintentional injury deaths in the United States for a number of years and for many years,

109
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:00,000
the United States has had one of the highest rates of overdose deaths when compared to all European countries.

110
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:07,000
The cause or causes for the increase in overdose deaths is multifactorial, as are the solutions.

111
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:19,070
Notably, in the last two years or so, the death rate for overdoses has declined somewhat from the peak in twenty seventeen.
