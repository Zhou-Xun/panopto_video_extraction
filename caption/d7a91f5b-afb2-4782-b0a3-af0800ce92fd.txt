1
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:11,490
So I went and stayed with my mom. And my mom and I went to visit my grandparents.

2
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:19,950
Oh, really? Good morning, everyone. I hope you enjoyed a long weekend.

3
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:27,149
Right. It's kind of nice to have that. After the first week of classes, if you weren't quite ready for the semester to start,

4
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:30,300
maybe give you a little bit of a reprieve to get yourself organized.

5
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,690
I know exactly. That's how I felt and how I took the weekend.

6
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:38,100
But here we are back again. Exposure, science.

7
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:43,410
And I wanted to start with a really quick announcement or demo.

8
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:48,180
I keep talking about the recordings that are available on the canvass site.

9
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:54,820
I just want to make sure you know where to where to find them. Uh, they are over here on the left tap or at the home page.

10
00:00:54,930 --> 00:01:00,450
Right. It has the course schedule and so forth. Over here on the left where it says Panopto recording.

11
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:06,330
I don't do anything special in terms of how they're titled. It just auto defaults by date.

12
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:14,190
So here's our recording that's going right now. So if you ever want to look back and review one of the lectures, I just kind of go by the date.

13
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:22,140
And of course, send me any questions along the way. Any questions about the recordings or access or even about the candidate site in general?

14
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:31,090
All right, good. Then on the slides.

15
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:41,860
So today we're going to talk about more specifically, we kind of alluded to these topics last week in our introduction about pathways,

16
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:50,320
exposure pathways and then routes of exposure, and then very importantly, identifying and understanding the differences between them.

17
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:54,550
Have a little bit of a similar kind of sounding names or descriptions.

18
00:01:55,270 --> 00:02:04,780
So our competencies, right, understand those routes of exposure, understand what are some of the common pathways of exposure,

19
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:12,249
and then we'll finish the class period with our exposure science and then news assignment and apologies.

20
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:17,049
When I didn't get to those last couple of slides in our last class on Thursday, they were,

21
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:21,850
of course, the introduction and kind of description of what to expect for the exposure sites.

22
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:25,780
And then so I kind of posted an announcement after class on Thursday.

23
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:31,390
I posted an assignment with a little bit of a description, so my apologies for that.

24
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:35,200
It's pretty low key, very informal. But we'll jump into that.

25
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:42,910
Our first. Yes. And then use assignment as the last session of the class period to any questions before we get started.

26
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:48,940
All right. Okay. So back to our model.

27
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:55,480
Right. We're going to I told you, we're going to reference this pretty frequently as we go through the class period, through the course.

28
00:02:56,770 --> 00:03:05,680
And very importantly, we have our sources, we have our outcomes, and we have some stuff that happens in between.

29
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:12,950
It's pretty important. One of them. Or are we going to talk about today are the the exposure pathways.

30
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:22,510
Right. So just because we have something that's emitted from a source, it might be able to build up some intensity that needs to somehow transport.

31
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:28,300
Right. And to go from the source to us. So that's going to be our exposure pathway or pathways.

32
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:34,660
And then once it possibly comes into contact with us,

33
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:43,120
then there are various routes of exposure where that hazardous agent might actually enter our bodies.

34
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:47,110
So we'll talk about those here a little bit briefly.

35
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:51,070
He alluded to this or introduced this last week.

36
00:03:51,670 --> 00:04:02,200
Those your primary exposure routes are either through ingestion, inhalation, skin contact or actually skin absorption.

37
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:13,530
So when we talk about these, these dermal routes of exposure, uh, one is through a simple contact.

38
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:24,380
Often it's a chemical, but it could be physical or biological that comes into contact with the outer boundary of our body, primarily through our skin.

39
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:32,010
Different from that, even though it might start with contact, our skin is dermal absorption.

40
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:38,190
So this actually describes the process by which that substance is transported

41
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:44,010
across the outer boundary and then is retained internally within our body.

42
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:51,510
Ingestion is another really important route of exposure.

43
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:55,770
So this involves some of the things that are probably obvious.

44
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:59,380
We purposefully ingest things right in order to sustain ourselves.

45
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,430
We purposely ingest liquids, a lot of water.

46
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:07,170
We purposely ingest food of all different types.

47
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,980
Uh, and in the case of infants, breast milk and then there are some others that we talked about that maybe aren't intentional.

48
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:17,580
We give some examples around soil and house dust.

49
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:25,980
And again, from a life stage point of view, you know, children end up being kind of most vulnerable or at risk to those particular instances.

50
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:35,580
And then we have inhalational exposures within the occupational or workplace setting.

51
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:39,420
This is really the primary exposure route of concern.

52
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:44,970
Most exposures within workplace settings take place on the inhalation.

53
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:51,050
It can be indoors, like in our classroom here.

54
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:55,560
We kind of talk to you some examples around that previously it can happen outdoors.

55
00:05:55,710 --> 00:06:03,120
It can be within that community setting. It can be within that workplace setting. We are breathing again, out of necessity, 24 seven.

56
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:10,260
So we're kind of at risk for whatever contaminants might be in that air that we're breathing regardless of where we are.

57
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:16,680
And then we get into some of those exposure pathways, right?

58
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:23,470
So an important differentiation just in the terminology, the roots of exposure that we kind of define those.

59
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:31,630
Inhalation ingestion, direct contact with our skin or absorption through our skin.

60
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:42,549
Our also has to be ways for that source once emitted into our environment or our surroundings to actually

61
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:50,800
come into contact with us and reach us and and potentially lead to exposure or uptake of that agent.

62
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:56,620
So we have, again, going back to the same example that we discussed previously, this chemical disposal site,

63
00:06:57,670 --> 00:07:07,540
if it's a volatile component, some of it might evaporate into the air, some of it might leach into soil or get into the water system.

64
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:16,480
So we might look to the atmosphere as an exposure pathway for that volatile component of the pollutant.

65
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:28,810
We might look at, uh, groundwater or waterways like a river where this contaminant made of leached or runoff or even the soil.

66
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:33,639
Right? It could be through direct contact with that soil.

67
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,850
It might be, uh, crops that are grown in the soil.

68
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:41,950
Right. That uptake it and then that food that we then eat further downstream.

69
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:49,470
And sometimes it's complicated, right? And this is kind of a theme of this course.

70
00:07:49,800 --> 00:08:00,330
We'll talk about one pollutant or one specific pathway or one route of exposure, like only an example or on inhalation.

71
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:07,230
But the reality is we're being bombarded by all of these stressors all at the same time.

72
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:15,870
And it's not just a multitude of stressors. It's a multitude of exposure pathways and a multitude of those routes of exposure.

73
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:25,290
So this is an example to just kind of help illustrate that the complicated ness of things are looking at dry, hollow veins.

74
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:31,410
This is a common byproduct of disinfection, of means, of drinking water.

75
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:39,420
And so in this case, over here on the left, we're looking at our exposed possible exposure pathways.

76
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:43,320
Over here on the middle. We're looking at our exposure routes.

77
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:48,210
And then perhaps some biomarkers where we might be able to detect this.

78
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:57,330
So trial on methane can be detected in blood serum as a biomarker and also be measured in exhaled breath from a person.

79
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:02,580
And the exposure routes that are possible in this case is it can be ingested.

80
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,350
It can be absorbed through our skin. It can also be breathed in.

81
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:12,630
I try to limit that's another one of these like semi volatile compounds that can be in the air.

82
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:19,410
It can also be in the water. So what are some of those exposure pathways then in this case?

83
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:30,630
Okay. So some of the easier ones, if it's a byproduct of disinfecting municipal drinking water, when we drink that tap water, we might be exposed.

84
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:34,080
Now, what about showering or in the shower?

85
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:39,420
Maybe a little bit volatile or breathing while we're in the shower, maybe a little bit of water gets in our mouth when we're in the shower.

86
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:47,309
So a couple of opportunities for exposure there. But again, we're starting some kind of multiply around for drinking.

87
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:50,580
It is pretty much ingestion if we're showering.

88
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:56,790
Some of it might be absorbing into our skin. Again, the volatile piece, some of it might be breezin.

89
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,630
And then again, maybe a little bit goes into your mouth while you're while you're in the shower.

90
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:06,059
And some of it can be ingested. Bathing. Similarly swimming.

91
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:09,060
Another one. Or fully immersed in the water.

92
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:15,850
So you just in contact with our inhalation are all above board washing dishes.

93
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:20,070
Right. Another kind of common interaction with the water. This one is a little bit gross.

94
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:29,300
Toilet. Right. Especially if you're in, like maybe a public setting in those really powerful commercial toilets, range of washing.

95
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:33,420
And it's kind of like a massive water moving everywhere.

96
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:41,310
Yeah, it can can generate certainly if it's volatile, release some of that gaseous component of the chemical into the air.

97
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:48,330
But even like small aerosols. Right. Can be like at least temporarily put into the into our breathing stuff.

98
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:52,350
So anyway, this is an example of a real issue.

99
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:59,640
Try. Hello. My name's are common concerns in municipal drinking water that a lot of people around the world utilize.

100
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,159
And it illustrates.

101
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:11,330
Right that it's it's all of the exposure that are brought here to consider many different possible exposure pathways that we might be concerned about.

102
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:18,709
All right. Along the lines of examples. And in this class,

103
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:23,210
this is my what I feel is the best way to kind of teach concepts is not just

104
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:27,620
to kind of lay them out and here's the framework and not actually apply them,

105
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:32,510
right? So we're going to step through the examples that every possible opportunity.

106
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:38,930
Let's go ahead and do one here. And this one, of course, is it's a little bit more dear to my interest.

107
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:45,050
We're going to take your, you know, possible types of agents that we previously defined.

108
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:49,640
We have the physical agents, biological agents and chemical agents.

109
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:54,440
Let's go ahead and choose airborne particulate matter.

110
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,170
There are a lot of chemicals in the air.

111
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:04,160
And just as a disclosure, the particles that are in the air are actually made up of lots of different chemicals.

112
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:09,500
So we could actually classify this agent as a chemical agent as well.

113
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:12,830
But for this example, we're just going to focus on the physical part of it.

114
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:21,200
Breathing in particles that our lungs really aren't designed to manage in and of itself can cause harmful side effects.

115
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:27,110
So we're going to take this particulate that's in the air classified as a physical agent.

116
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:32,300
There are natural sources of particulates. We kind of went through some of those examples.

117
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:39,110
I think one of the best ones is a volcano, right? Massive eruption, spews a ton of aerosols up into the atmosphere.

118
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:45,800
But in this case, we'll actually look at synthetic sources, a very common one,

119
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:55,370
especially in the eastern half of the US and in many other countries around the world where coal is burned in order to generate electricity.

120
00:12:56,270 --> 00:13:02,630
Much of that coal, when it's when it's mined out of the earth, is naturally enriched in sulfur.

121
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:10,970
So when that coal is burned at a high temperature, the sulfur is released in a gaseous form as sulfur dioxide.

122
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:17,000
We'll talk about it later in the semester. Exactly how it happens.

123
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:23,540
But that sulfur dioxide gas, as it's emitted into the atmosphere and travels downwind,

124
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:31,940
actually has an opportunity to kind of chemical chemically react and convert itself into a particulate into a sulfate particle.

125
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:39,980
And so this makes up a large mass percentage of the particulates in the air around the globe

126
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:44,840
is in the form of these sulfates due to the combustion of coal for generating electricity.

127
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,780
And we kind of defines a couple of different settings. Right?

128
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:55,549
In this class, we're very purposefully looking at exposures that take place primarily in a workplace setting.

129
00:13:55,550 --> 00:14:00,560
And the reason for that is because there are a lot of standards and regulations specific

130
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:05,240
to workplaces and therefore opportunities for mitigation and reduction of exposure.

131
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,790
We'll get into that a little bit later in the semester,

132
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:14,900
but it's kind of the reason why we're differentiating so people can be exposed to particulates in the air in a workplace setting.

133
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,790
For this example, we'll look at a setting that is a bit more community based.

134
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:25,700
All right. So a little bit of background in order to understand these.

135
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:31,189
We talk about this PPM. It's kind of the abbreviation because particulate matter is a little bit of a mouthful.

136
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:34,370
We find that importantly,

137
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:40,669
the scientific community recognizes some different size fractions that exist and they're

138
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:45,020
important for a couple of reasons that will that will highlight here in a minute.

139
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:49,700
But just to give some reference, when we when we refer to different sizes, what does it mean?

140
00:14:50,360 --> 00:15:00,230
So in terms of standards that exist for regulating particles in the air, there are standards for PM 2.5 and there are standards for PM10.

141
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:04,220
So what does that mean? What does the 10 p.m. at 2.5 mean?

142
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:12,020
It's a reference to the aerodynamic diameter, so the size of the particles in microns.

143
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:16,310
So PM 2.5 refers to particles that are less than two and a half microns.

144
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:21,830
PM10 is particles less than ten micron. Okay, how big is a micron?

145
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:29,389
So let's let's start at the big stuff out here, the width of a typical human hair,

146
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:35,480
of course, there's some variation is maybe on the order of 75 to 100 microns.

147
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:43,240
The tip of a of a pin is about 50 microns for most people.

148
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:50,180
That's the limit of of natural being. So generally less once you get under 50 microns.

149
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:56,410
It's not something that we can see with our naked eyes without the help of, you know, microscopes and so forth.

150
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:09,400
A pollen that is common in outdoors is typically in the range of a larger than ten, maybe maybe 10 to 30 microns or so.

151
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:15,940
A typical cell is somewhere between maybe seven and ten microns.

152
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,710
A red blood cells specifically are closer to five microns.

153
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:25,810
That individual bacteria are maybe around one micron.

154
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:30,460
Then we get to really small stuff on this slide.

155
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:37,780
It's termed ultrafine particles, and that's particles that are less than 0.1 microns.

156
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:43,610
Another term that is defined almost exactly the same but is a bit more common.

157
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:49,810
We heard and maybe popular press articles is nanoparticles.

158
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:55,750
And the scientific committees use different terms because ultrafine particles,

159
00:16:56,230 --> 00:17:00,610
when we talk about pollution, are those that aren't purposefully generated,

160
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:09,220
whereas nanoparticles are often purposely generated as part of a manufacturing production of different substances and so forth.

161
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:17,050
Back to our reference, a virus, you know, is in the in the range of about 0.1.

162
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:23,060
And then when we get down to individual molecules or at 0.01.

163
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,720
So that gives you a little bit of a reference when we're talking about, you know,

164
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:32,170
the size of particles here and our risk for inhaling them and possible side effects.

165
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,270
All right. So what's the relevance of all of this?

166
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:51,310
Our upper airways, upper airways, our nasal cavity, our throat are actually designed pretty well to filter out large particles for the most part,

167
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:55,510
particles that are greater than ten microns in diameter.

168
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:10,450
The hairs in our nose, the mucous membranes that line our nasal cavities and into our throat are actually really effective at removing

169
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:18,880
those large particles and then mechanisms for removing them so that they don't get into our lower airways.

170
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:24,640
Part of it might be like coughing or actually swallowing it.

171
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:31,040
So in that case, the particles are still getting into our body, but they're going through our gastrointestinal tract instead of our lives.

172
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:40,360
Right. Or our GI system is much better designed to manage a few particles, whereas our lungs are not so much one of the.

173
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:45,910
One of the examples is actually was a better example pre-pandemic than it is now.

174
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:51,280
But being the exposure scientist that I am, it's actually an embarrassing story.

175
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:58,570
But I will randomly not very often, not as often as I need to sweep the garage at home.

176
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:02,950
Right. It's often like a mask. I'm not like a big bird.

177
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:10,060
And for the most part, I would try to get it organized and just kind of on a whim will start sweeping and it kicks up a bunch of dust.

178
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:14,710
Right. I can see like it's floating around, you know, in the garage.

179
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:23,950
If I, if I stop sweeping for a few minutes, it actually settles out pretty quickly because these are really big particles aerodynamically.

180
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:31,450
They can't be blown very far in the wind before they are metrically settled and back down to the ground surface.

181
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:37,180
The embarrassing part is I would often be doing this without a mask on.

182
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:40,870
Right. Like complete mind blank.

183
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:44,409
I know about this stuff. I should have a mask on. I'm just.

184
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:49,660
It's an easy, uh, preventative measure to not be breathing this stuff in.

185
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:56,200
So what would often happen is, after sweeping for not very long, I'm not a huge, again, garage maintainer.

186
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:57,580
Let's say 10 minutes.

187
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:07,840
I would blow my nose into a white tissue and I would very easily see like these brown and black particles that come out onto the white tissue.

188
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:13,420
So these are those very large particles greater than ten microns that my upper

189
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:17,940
airways have done a good job of removing and protecting my lower airways.

190
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:24,550
All right. The problem comes with those particles that are less than ten microns.

191
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,480
They aren't efficiently scrubbed by our upper airways.

192
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:37,470
They do reach our lower airways, where we have impaction of these particles in bronchial tubes, in lung tissues.

193
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:44,080
And again, this is just kind of the physical irritant part of particles looking at the physical agents side of things.

194
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:53,140
If the particles are small enough, like when we talk about those ultrafine particles, then they actually begin to behave like a gas.

195
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:57,310
So our lungs are designed right to to breathe in. Oxygen.

196
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:15,370
We need this to sustain ourselves. And once you get down to about 0.075 or 3.75 microns .075 microns, uh aerodynamically.

197
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:20,500
Those particles are so small that they basically behave like a gas so they can actually

198
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:26,170
be absorbed right into our bloodstream and then circulate through our bodies.

199
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:34,220
I alluded to the chemical part of it. Right. So we can also look at particulate matter as a chemical agent.

200
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:37,760
So as those particles become impacted into our lungs,

201
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:44,540
there's then a chance for whatever chemicals are soluble in that particles to reach across into the lung tissue.

202
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:51,470
So M actually functions as both a physical irritant or physical agent as well as a chemical agent.

203
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:56,329
So this is where our primary concern is below ten microns.

204
00:21:56,330 --> 00:22:02,270
Because of the way that our lungs are designed, we're susceptible to the smaller particles from exposure perspective.

205
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:08,360
Moving along our model, right. So we've talked about some sources.

206
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:16,040
We've talked about a couple of different routes of exposure, primarily inhalation that we're concerned about with air pollutants.

207
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:22,490
We talked about some sources of the pollutants. Right. And the sense of coal combustion or electricity generation.

208
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:33,170
So it's in the atmosphere, right. Which in this case is our exposure pathway and is emitted or the pollution is emitted, the particles can move along,

209
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:43,040
but our time activity and our behavior then comes into play in order for us to come into contact with these particles or not.

210
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:52,820
We looked at this example, which actually is for ozone ppm previously, where we see a large degree of spatial variability focusing on the US,

211
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:57,709
but then even within individual urban areas, a great degree of variability.

212
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:06,260
This is the case for particulate matter as well, much of it driven by where those sources of the particles are combined with meteorology.

213
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:10,550
Right. Which way on any given day is the wind blowing particles?

214
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:16,040
I'm going to highlight some some research of my own.

215
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:20,240
This is actually going back quite a bit, quite a ways. This is 20 years ago.

216
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:31,160
I have done a couple of decades worth of work not too far away from here in communities of Detroit, which is maybe via drive.

217
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:39,220
It's about a 40 minute drive or so. A little bit of background for those that are from southeast Michigan.

218
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:43,340
You're probably familiar with this geography for those that are not a little bit of orientation.

219
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:51,860
So this is the Detroit River, which connects Lake St Clair further up to Lake Erie,

220
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:59,090
further down kind of on the north and west side of the river is the US and the city of Detroit.

221
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:06,530
Just on the other side of the river is Canada and the province of Ontario in the city of Windsor.

222
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:13,490
And there are some pretty prominent sources historically in Detroit.

223
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:21,800
There's a lot of industry along the riverfront here and what's kind of defined as the south southwest part of the city.

224
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:28,190
Uh, again, some of those are that coal combustion, chemical manufacturing,

225
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:39,140
iron and steel production very much related to the long term automotive industry in southeast Michigan as well as motor vehicles.

226
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:43,370
Right. So some of those stationary sources, but also mobile sources as well.

227
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:51,530
And importantly, you know, highlighted in the slide here is is the Ambassador Bridge that connects the U.S. to Canada.

228
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:59,780
It is and has been for a long time the busiest commercial border crossing between the US and Canada.

229
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:09,980
So because of that, lots and lots of trucks, trucks that burn diesel fuel and because it's an international border crossing, it's not very quick.

230
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:18,760
There's a lot of customs and paperwork and so forth, large backups of trucks on both sides of the bridge.

231
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:24,320
So this also ends up being a large potential source of pollutants to the air.

232
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:28,490
So we set up we did monitoring of PPM.

233
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:33,499
These particular studies were related to a couple of different outcomes.

234
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:39,860
One was a cohort of children with asthma. Another was adults and their risk for cardiovascular disease.

235
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:46,100
And so we did monitoring it had cohorts of participants on the east side of Detroit,

236
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:51,200
in the northwest part of Detroit, and then in the southwest part of Detroit.

237
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:57,410
And kind of the basic hypotheses going in, knowing the location of these sources.

238
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:06,620
And we have a lot of industry along the riverfront. We have a very busy bridge crossing here between Detroit and Windsor.

239
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:15,980
Was the residents in this immediate southwest Detroit community would be exposed to the highest levels of pollutants, and particularly the PM.

240
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:24,950
It's in the air. We hypothesize that those in the Northwest community might receive the least amount because it's a little bit upwind.

241
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:29,750
Most of the wind patterns that kind of arrive to southeast Michigan come from the west.

242
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:32,450
We're kind of going from this direction across.

243
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:40,910
And then the residents in East Detroit, even though they are not as close to these emission sources because they're sort of downwind,

244
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:46,370
maybe they would have higher exposure levels compared to the community in the northwest part of the city.

245
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:51,680
Couple of photos. These are these are my own.

246
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:55,790
And again, they're kind of aged. I want to point out a couple of things.

247
00:26:56,420 --> 00:27:01,640
Uh, these are some photos in Southwest Detroit and along the riverfront.

248
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:10,010
This particular facility here at the top is the Detroit Wastewater Sewage Treatment Plant.

249
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:16,010
When you see the stacks here and in the background and actually it's probably hard to see in the slide,

250
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:23,060
but I don't know if you can make out this kind of yellowish brownish color coming out of the top, the emission.

251
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:31,130
So what this facility serves at is for much of southeast Michigan, not all of it,

252
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:38,730
much of it, an area that serves about 4 million people, all of the sewage.

253
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:38,940
Right.

254
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:48,470
So every time someone turns on the faucet and the water drains, flushes the toilet, etc., it all goes to this single facility in southwest Detroit.

255
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:57,060
There is a couple of steps in the in the treatment process that separates the liquids from the solids.

256
00:27:57,630 --> 00:28:02,400
The liquids are then treated and discharged into the Detroit River.

257
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:07,560
The solids are dried out as much as possible, and then they're burned.

258
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:19,260
So this is basically right 4 million people's worth of poop, for the most part, being incinerated at this facility 24/7.

259
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:29,160
It's a nonstop process over here is this is actually from the river looking to the U.S. side, the Detroit shoreline.

260
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:41,370
Some of the heavy industry here. This is from the Illinois side, looking towards the riverfront and the industry from Kansas back side.

261
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:48,629
And then these two in the lower part are looking at just an illustration of a lot of that diesel truck

262
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:57,720
traffic that is often stacking up within the community as part of mostly waiting to cross into Canada,

263
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:02,700
but then depending on traffic conditions, also kind of coming off the bridge into the U.S.

264
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:08,610
All right. So a lot of background. Let's look at a little bit of data.

265
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:21,810
This data that we're looking at represents three years of continuous measurements of GM and a couple of different locations within those study sites.

266
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:29,310
And I actually threw in a wrinkle here on the data slide. Looking at a component of him, I'm not very good at colors.

267
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:36,870
This orangish reddish color is the PPM in southwest Detroit.

268
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:44,040
This kind of greenish color is the pink on the east side community of Detroit.

269
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:52,170
And then this kind of bluish aqua color represents a fraction of ppm that we call black carbon.

270
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:56,280
So I mentioned that the PM is made up of lots of different chemicals.

271
00:29:57,090 --> 00:30:05,310
One of the contributors, the particles, in addition to some organic components, even some volatile components,

272
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:11,820
is basically soot that's generated from high temperature combustion, often of fuels.

273
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:19,920
So like the diesel that's emitted, you might see trucks or busses that have these that are either older,

274
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:25,950
um, in terms of when they were built or they just aren't properly maintained when they accelerate, right?

275
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:29,880
You see kind of that black soot come out of the stack of a truck or a bus.

276
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:36,480
So this would be black carbon. So we were interested in measuring the black carbon in that southwest community.

277
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:41,880
Again, because of its close proximity right to this to this Ambassador Bridge crossing,

278
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:47,310
where we knew we had a very high, uh, number of trucks crossing.

279
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:54,240
Yeah. Question Was this before the giant petcoke like piles were right underneath the bridge?

280
00:30:54,290 --> 00:31:06,839
It's. Yes, it is. So in more recent years, there's been challenges of there's Coke production, which,

281
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:14,780
without getting into too many details, is not a complete process to, uh, burning coal as a waste product.

282
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:25,380
It's, you know, tons of hazardous chemicals. And the facility that has been doing this locally was for an obvious reason,

283
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:30,510
basically stacking up this petcoke product in big piles along the riverfront.

284
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:36,270
And then just on windy days, it would kind of like blow this, you know, nasty black cloud.

285
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:40,200
And it's even an issue, an international issue,

286
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:46,100
because the folks across the river in Windsor see this because of the predominant winds blowing across, hey, what is going on?

287
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:52,290
You need to do something about this. Um, that's actually a good opportunity to illustrate that to our particle sizes.

288
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:58,709
So when the diesel is emitted from a truck, it's, it's burning that fuel at a high temperature.

289
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:01,980
Right? We talked about the coal burned at a high temperature.

290
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:09,660
Coke that's sitting there in piles being blown by the wind is not from a high temperature combustion process.

291
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:13,080
It's more akin to like me sweeping in the garage.

292
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:18,570
It's just particles being disturbed into the air. So those are generally larger particles.

293
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:24,930
So the risk for lower airway inhalation of those types of particles would be low.

294
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:33,320
But still, you know, it's it's full of a lot of toxic hazardous substances that can get into the ground, can get into the water.

295
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:42,150
Right. Lots of different other exposure pathways. For the most part, inhalation wouldn't be as big of a concern for those types of particles.

296
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:47,460
But yes, these pictures are from before the petcoke issue came up.

297
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:52,190
Good question. And thanks for pointing that out. Okay.

298
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:54,709
So let's do a little bit of data interpretation.

299
00:32:54,710 --> 00:33:03,140
So you're all evolving exposure scientists now this is one of the challenges is okay, you know, the sources are important.

300
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:08,420
You know what those exposure pathways might be. You know who is at risk, right?

301
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:16,729
For different routes of exposure, in this case, inhalation, you've got to be able to like look at the data and make some heads or tails out of it.

302
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:19,460
All right. We've collected data over three years.

303
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:31,580
These were using continuous instruments that we integrated into hourly averages and then average those hours across every day of the three years.

304
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:40,879
Right. So over 1000 days. So, for example, this is midnight, 1 a.m., 2 a.m. along the bottom access.

305
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:49,070
Here is a time over here on the left is our micrograms per cubic meter of PM 2.5.

306
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:55,120
So at midnight, the average concentration over three years.

307
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:59,350
Right. And Southwest Detroit was about a little bit under 15.

308
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:05,860
Right. And then the average concentration at one time, the average concentration at 2 a.m. and so forth throughout the day.

309
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:14,410
So there's a little bit of structure to this data. Right. Temporally over time, I'm going to pick out, you know,

310
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:20,710
southwest Detroit here at the top in this red orange color during the early morning hours, the nighttime.

311
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:24,370
Basically, it's relatively constant on average.

312
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:28,330
But then on average, there is a pretty big peak here in the morning.

313
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:33,280
What might be going on to cause that peak in the PM 2.5?

314
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:36,770
Like morning commuter traffic? Sure, absolutely.

315
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:41,800
So we talked about the presence of mobile sources as a relatively urban area.

316
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:46,140
Yeah. People getting out, going to work, school busses.

317
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:54,400
Right. Children going to school. You know, all of these different activities would absolutely explain why we would see a peak in the morning.

318
00:34:54,400 --> 00:35:01,060
And I'm going to eyeball what it probably goes from about 7 a.m. to maybe 930, even 10:00 or so.

319
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:09,400
And then it kind of comes back down right roughly to the level that it was earlier in the night in those early morning hours.

320
00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:13,830
Okay. So good answer. There is a commute.

321
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:21,030
People are driving to work. Kids are going to school. We have an increase in those particles in the local atmosphere.

322
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:26,910
Why don't we see a big peak in the afternoon? It starts to drift up.

323
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:35,250
Right. We're looking at 5 p.m., 6 p.m., 7 p.m., but not the same coincident peak later in the day.

324
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:40,310
What's going on there? Those people are like workaholic. The kids are like studying all night.

325
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:46,720
What's going on? Nobody goes home. Yes.

326
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:53,400
It's the wind blowing in a way. Uh, good answer.

327
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:57,390
Um, and there's a kind of unfair question. So thanks for answering.

328
00:35:57,810 --> 00:36:05,440
Um, so it's related to meteorology, and I'll talk a little bit more, but does anybody else have further to do with the sun?

329
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:12,180
Yes. It's really like sun rising, like you're heating up in the morning, is keeping like the air trapped more than at night?

330
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:16,350
Yeah, we're getting really close. That's great. Anybody else want to add to that?

331
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:25,620
Thanks for those answer. Those are really good. So a little bit of a description, but you're not responsible for understanding it.

332
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:31,320
Now, we're going to talk about this later in the semester. But yes, there are some dynamics, right?

333
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:36,150
Importantly, during this nighttime, it's dark.

334
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:47,370
There is no sun, there's no incident, sunlight. And what happens is when the sun rises, right, when the sun really it's motionless.

335
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:50,580
For the most part, we're orbiting the sun. Right. So we're the ones that are moving.

336
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:55,440
But we see it on the horizon. Uh, it begins to heat the earth's surface.

337
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:06,600
And the Earth's surface gives that off in the form of infrared radiation, and that generates parcels of air that arise.

338
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:11,760
And this is how our our local atmosphere begins to over the course of the day.

339
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:21,030
But, yes, during that early part of the day, there's not a whole lot of vertical mixing from that instead of sunlight.

340
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:26,730
So whatever is being emitted at the local level can often be all of the time.

341
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:34,650
That can often be trapped within a lower layer, basically capped thermally by the structure of the atmosphere,

342
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:39,180
so that it builds up to a higher concentration and a lower volume.

343
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:44,520
Right. Whereas later in the day, after the sun has been up for hours.

344
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,900
Right, we have those warming parcels and we have a lot of vertical mixing.

345
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:53,190
So that thermal cap basically rises to a much higher level in the atmosphere.

346
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:58,080
So even with the exact same emissions happening over the course of the day,

347
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:04,740
it was admitted we have much more opportunity to kind of dilute into a larger volumetric space with the atmosphere.

348
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:08,850
So, yes, the good news is that people do get to go home at the end of their work day.

349
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:14,460
The kids do get to go home from school. Those emissions, unfortunately, are still taking place.

350
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:20,760
But from an environmental intensity perspective, right through this exposure pathway of the local atmosphere,

351
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:28,650
it doesn't have the opportunity on average to accumulate to as high of a concentration later in the day.

352
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:33,240
So thanks very much again for those answers. Those are great. Okay.

353
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:39,810
So that's our southwest Detroit. So we look at the east side of Detroit, we see a similar structure.

354
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:44,220
So again, that morning commute effect on the east side.

355
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:49,259
But when you look on average across that entire day span, right,

356
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:55,590
the concentration is always lower on the east side, which again, was kind of part of our excuse me, our hypothesis.

357
00:38:57,630 --> 00:39:00,780
We're closer to those sources in the southwest part of the city.

358
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:04,680
So we're seeing higher concentrations on that sense.

359
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:11,640
And then that Southwest Detroit black carbon measurement that we put on purpose, we see a similar structure,

360
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:21,360
but that increase right in the morning is a bit more dramatic than seen for the total PPM measurement.

361
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:26,190
And again, that's highlighted by that very localized diesel truck effect.

362
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:36,090
And in that localized community, we see a huge increase in the levels of the black carbon component from diesel in that being of 2.5.

363
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:42,760
All right, so now we have those particles present in our local atmosphere.

364
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:47,740
It's only a problem if people actually come into contact with it.

365
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:52,650
Right. If it just stays up in the atmosphere, we don't go outdoors.

366
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:57,399
We have the homes sealed up very tightly. Right. We we don't come into contact with it.

367
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:01,090
So here's where our activity and behavior comes into play.

368
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:07,690
This is some data from the same study I mentioned, that cohort of kids with asthma.

369
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:13,420
We did some diaries about their activity patterns and what they do.

370
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:16,930
And this is it's aggregated in some very basic categories.

371
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:24,820
The blue ID or aqua, again, my apologies for my color interpretation is when they're at home indoors.

372
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:29,650
The yellow is when they're at school. This red orange is when they're outdoors.

373
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:33,340
And then the blue is some other indoor environment.

374
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:41,770
Maybe they're at the friend's house, at grandmother's family member's house, at the mall or the movie theater, whatever it might be, and.

375
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:47,500
And broken down by season. Right. So winter, spring, summer and then into the autumn.

376
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:53,740
And we see not a whole lot of change for how much time they spend at home.

377
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:58,120
Most of their time, upwards of three quarters of their time stays.

378
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:01,300
70% is spent at home.

379
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:09,970
The school does change. Right here is, you know, their daytime at school and the winter in the spring and the fall.

380
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:15,310
This is real. And in our cohort, there were kids that attended summer school.

381
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:18,980
So there is a smaller fraction, but still here.

382
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:23,020
And then you see some, you know, fortunately, some outdoors.

383
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:27,250
Right. Michigan is a bit cold in the winter and not a whole lot of time outdoors.

384
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:31,850
A little bit larger. Not much in the spring and the fall during the summer.

385
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:36,520
Absolutely. I think kids are spending more time outdoors. So this is important information to know.

386
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:41,290
Right. We're really worried about all these emissions in the outdoor environment.

387
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:46,840
Very local sources. So that environmental intensity is there.

388
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:51,190
But it's only an issue if the kids are in that outdoor environment.

389
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:57,670
Right. To be to be exposed. So this is really good information to know what we're doing, our exposure assessment.

390
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:05,770
All right. Well, we just learned that the kids are spending 70% of their time indoors at home.

391
00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:15,520
Okay, well, that's good. But let's kind of shift that that environment or that pathway to the indoor environment we know other at home.

392
00:42:16,090 --> 00:42:21,250
Well, particles are also a concern indoors as well, even within residential homes.

393
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:31,270
Um, any type of combustion fireplaces, candles, um, gas stoves.

394
00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:42,100
Right. And how properly maintained all of these things are. And ventilated, cooking itself, grilling, smoking, whatever this is.

395
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:53,650
This particular example is just focused on smoking. In this case, smoking meaning cigaret smoking another form of combustion right indoors.

396
00:42:54,370 --> 00:43:02,800
But looking at some pretty big increases which someone is smoking in the kitchen and then looking elsewhere outside the house.

397
00:43:03,610 --> 00:43:10,120
Even when someone is in the kitchen, that smoke is moving into the living room.

398
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:14,350
So now we're into a much more local scale of activity, right?

399
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:15,370
Where are the kids?

400
00:43:15,790 --> 00:43:21,990
Are they hanging out in the kitchen and someone is smoking or are they in the living room where they're in their bedroom and so forth?

401
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:31,560
So there's this time activity overlaid with the environmental intensity are really key to understand, right?

402
00:43:31,570 --> 00:43:40,810
In order to be able to assess, okay, is someone actually up taking the PM inside the body and receiving a dose?

403
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:49,020
Any any questions? I kind of thought that was a little bit of a complicated example, but again, on purpose, right?

404
00:43:49,070 --> 00:43:56,260
Like we can only intro things for so long before anybody kind of started diving in and thinking about and hopefully walked away with.

405
00:43:56,290 --> 00:44:00,850
Yeah, that can be pretty complicated. Okay, I kind of get it now. Any questions?

406
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:08,200
So were the kids in your study carrying around, like, a little thing all day to measure those?

407
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:12,579
Yeah. Yeah, that's a that's a great question. It was a really cool study.

408
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:15,580
It was a it was a big multi-disciplinary study.

409
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:19,240
So don't give me a bunch of credit for it wasn't all my idea.

410
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:23,470
As you might imagine, my my role was exposure assessment.

411
00:44:23,950 --> 00:44:29,470
Right. So, yes, so we had these personal monitors that the kids wore with them.

412
00:44:29,830 --> 00:44:34,150
They were young children aged 5 to 11. Most of them were in elementary school.

413
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:40,000
So it really wasn't workable to have them. Like we're like an occupational worker, right?

414
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:46,240
Kind of like on their belt or something. So I should bring some of these into the classroom with them.

415
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:51,100
I was kind of pass them around. Uh, we ended up landing on these backpacks.

416
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:55,750
They were small backpacks. Um, not like what you all have.

417
00:44:55,750 --> 00:45:01,430
Almost like, you know, cute little doll size, you know, backpacks, right?

418
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:10,070
Just big enough to fit this monitor. And I had a team coming out that was like in there breathing sound, right.

419
00:45:10,090 --> 00:45:16,060
And we kind of included some some foam to muffle the sound.

420
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:20,770
Right. So this was an issue. They're wearing this all day long, wearing it to school.

421
00:45:20,770 --> 00:45:25,480
It can't be disruptive, right. It's already disruptive to them because they have to carry the small backpack around.

422
00:45:26,950 --> 00:45:32,650
But, you know, in order for it to fly in classrooms, you know, it can't be interrupting classroom activities.

423
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:39,490
So and there was actually a ton of like, I would call it focus group feedback on the backpacks.

424
00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:52,510
Uh, what, you know, so much of participant engagement is retaining them through the study and having them actually do what we're asking them to do.

425
00:45:52,510 --> 00:45:57,999
Right. So what's going to encourage the kids to actually wear these?

426
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,559
Well, it's kind of look kind of I don't want to say cool, but, you know, not offensive, right.

427
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:06,940
If they're going to they want to be embarrassed by wearing it ended up being like this pretty

428
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:13,390
subtle like black little white trim is what the kids kind of they got to keep them right at that.

429
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:18,850
At the end of each measurement period, they would do this for two weeks at a time for each season.

430
00:46:19,090 --> 00:46:23,530
So two weeks in the fall, two weeks in the summer, spring and winter.

431
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:30,460
And yeah, so we're measuring this. The data would be we have filters in line.

432
00:46:30,910 --> 00:46:38,860
Um, we can analyze the filters back in the lab and get chemical information as well from the particles in addition to just overall mass levels.

433
00:46:39,370 --> 00:46:44,829
And then during those two weeks, the kids would keep those time activity diaries.

434
00:46:44,830 --> 00:46:48,130
Right. We looked at a little bit of a summary of those here.

435
00:46:49,030 --> 00:46:55,870
They also kept symptom diaries, right? Are they wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath and so forth?

436
00:46:56,680 --> 00:47:05,950
And then they also had this really cool, these personal parameters that they would blow into in the morning each day and in the evening each day.

437
00:47:06,310 --> 00:47:13,030
Right. So this is a measure of their lung function. So they do a whole sample and breathe into it and it would record.

438
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:16,450
There were two key things that we were looking at as part of the study.

439
00:47:18,070 --> 00:47:27,370
One was FEV1, which is forced expiratory volume at 1/2 and then another one called peak flow.

440
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:38,050
But anyway, these measures were actually an indicator, right, of their lung function each day over the course that we're monitoring their exposures.

441
00:47:38,050 --> 00:47:42,520
I can talk about some of the data a little bit later in the course and what the what the results were.

442
00:47:43,090 --> 00:47:46,120
Um, but yeah, that was, that was the basic study design.

443
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:53,980
And they're going to have lots of fantastic collaborators of pediatric pulmonologists, right, that are physician scientists,

444
00:47:55,990 --> 00:48:05,410
folks working in health behavior around, you know, designing the diaries and so forth were recording data and information.

445
00:48:06,430 --> 00:48:11,980
Good question. Thanks for the interest. And yeah, I can share some more later in the semester about this particular study.

446
00:48:12,610 --> 00:48:18,560
Any other questions? All right.

447
00:48:19,070 --> 00:48:25,040
So this is my introduction into our next activity in a couple of minutes.

448
00:48:26,030 --> 00:48:31,100
We're going to split up and do our ease in the news activity with remaining time in class.

449
00:48:32,060 --> 00:48:37,490
I'm actually going to share. I thought this was a little bit relevant based on what we talked about last week.

450
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:41,570
This is this is exposure science in the fall news.

451
00:48:42,650 --> 00:48:47,960
This is going back to an article that was published in the New England Journal of Medicine back in 1983.

452
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:54,460
But what's cool about it from my perspective is it was written by Jerome Noriega,

453
00:48:55,550 --> 00:48:59,430
who is was used to be one of my colleagues here in environmental sciences.

454
00:48:59,450 --> 00:49:03,740
He's now an emeritus faculty member, still active, still conducting research.

455
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:12,770
Ridiculously published in one of the world's recognized experts on heavy metal pollution and exposure.

456
00:49:13,130 --> 00:49:16,700
And so he wrote this really cool paper again decades ago.

457
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:27,620
We talked last week about some of the hazardous chemicals that tend to be related to income status in terms of exposure.

458
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:31,220
So we talked about how some of the perfluorinated substances, you know,

459
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:36,740
the more costly consumer products we talked about mercury in fish, seafood is kind of expensive, right?

460
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:40,940
So higher income tends to be have higher exposure to these.

461
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:50,390
Well, with that lid we talked about cadmium, where low income communities tend to have highest exposures.

462
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:54,080
So this was an interesting analysis that kind of flipped the script a little bit.

463
00:49:55,220 --> 00:50:02,750
But Professor Neri argue postulated that lead poisoning might have contributed to the fall of the Roman Empire.

464
00:50:03,050 --> 00:50:06,380
You know, 2000 years ago, or I guess almost 2000 years ago.

465
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:12,860
And he did this exposure analysis where he looked at, you know, the well-off, the well-to-do,

466
00:50:12,950 --> 00:50:21,200
the aristocrats in this in his labeling and estimated what their exposure was, their water exposure from drinking wines,

467
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:27,770
from different foods, looked at, you know, maybe the more common peasants and then looked at,

468
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:34,310
you know, kind of the lower end of that social status at the time and those that were enslaved.

469
00:50:34,970 --> 00:50:42,800
And it turns out that, you know, those that were kind of living the good life from their access to the water and the wines and the foods,

470
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:53,600
uh, the, the, the Roman Empire during this time was very well known for its building of aqueducts and its distribution of water.

471
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:58,370
All of the plumbing from the time was made out of the lake.

472
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:03,950
So those with most access to all of this were exposed to higher levels of lead.

473
00:51:05,030 --> 00:51:10,669
And so, you know, Jerome kind of characterized all of these as part of his exposure assessment.

474
00:51:10,670 --> 00:51:18,690
And then he said, you know, perhaps lead poisoning, which is, uh, a neuro toxin, right.

475
00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:24,110
Causes all kinds of things related to behavior, intellectual capacity,

476
00:51:24,170 --> 00:51:29,210
mental capacities and so forth, you know, perhaps had a role to play back in the day.

477
00:51:29,330 --> 00:51:34,310
So anyway, that's my very quick exposure, science in the news to share as a little bit of an introduction.

478
00:51:34,850 --> 00:51:40,610
I mean, some quick mental math on how much time we've got left. We've got about 27 minutes left in class.

479
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:45,470
So I'm going to say let's break up into groups of four.

480
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:52,460
I'll let you self-select. Hopefully you don't need to get up and like, you know, go from one in the classroom to the other.

481
00:51:53,210 --> 00:52:02,690
Each of you in your group before we'll have 5 minutes to give, like a verbal summary of the article that you reviewed and you are brought to class.

482
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:06,830
I'll interject every 5 minutes and say, okay, move on to the next person class.

483
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:13,880
We'll take 20 minutes to get through. That will reconvene for what's remaining in the class period from each group.

484
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:18,439
I'm going to ask you to choose one person to kind of report out what was the most

485
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:21,770
interesting of the articles that you discussed to report out for the whole class?

486
00:52:23,090 --> 00:52:27,150
Any questions where we get started? All right.

487
00:52:27,510 --> 00:52:35,130
Go for it. You see the swing down here?

488
00:52:41,170 --> 00:52:50,950
Obviously it's not much of a current, but at least on the timer also.

489
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:55,839
So let's go ahead and reconvene. That's all the same screenshots.

490
00:52:55,840 --> 00:53:12,170
Oh I just for the exposure so trust hopefully that's how I know that's why I really

491
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:23,690
it's a chance to learn a lot of different experiences that share at the same time.

492
00:53:23,740 --> 00:53:28,720
Starting to talk a little bit about what we're studying.

493
00:53:29,110 --> 00:53:35,020
Right. So the assignment, I think I looked at it really quickly was to pull something from your past,

494
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:43,690
whether you live where visited a particular location, but then also an eye towards characterizing the agent.

495
00:53:43,690 --> 00:53:49,330
Right. Was it is it related to a chemical stressor, a physical transfer or a biological stressor?

496
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:52,900
It's a really quickly and one minute or less.

497
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:59,740
Let's go ahead and do a quick report out from each group. Let's start with the group on my right and what kind of work our way across the classroom.

498
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:03,550
What did you all come up with as your article The Street part out?

499
00:54:04,150 --> 00:54:11,200
Um, I'm from Turkey, so I found this article and it's actually like multiple articles as it's happening right now.

500
00:54:11,470 --> 00:54:17,110
But there's a Brazilian warship that has to be dismantled and they want it to be done in Turkey.

501
00:54:17,410 --> 00:54:23,710
But its sister ship had 700 tons of asbestos on it when it was dismantled in India.

502
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:26,650
And so the Turkish, like local government and unions,

503
00:54:26,650 --> 00:54:31,780
are pushing back and they want like an environmental report before they bring the boat into the country.

504
00:54:32,110 --> 00:54:36,910
And the current environment report says there's only nine tons of asbestos on it.

505
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:44,920
But it also has like a bunch of discrepancies because the timeline of when the boat was built, it should have way more like other chemicals.

506
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:48,490
And they're like, there's none of those on there. Like Trust us.

507
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:57,820
And so right now it's kind of awkward because as of August 26 or something, Brazil's government is like, we can't redo the environmental report.

508
00:54:57,850 --> 00:55:01,390
The boat is on its way to Turkey. And Turkey is like, We don't want your boat.

509
00:55:01,870 --> 00:55:05,410
Can you take it back? Because of the boats, it's like on its way.

510
00:55:05,450 --> 00:55:12,400
I don't really know what's going to happen when it gets there because it's going to be on the Mediterranean coast, which is shared with the EU.

511
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:16,060
And so if the EU has to get involved, it would not end well for anybody.

512
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:17,950
Right. Absolutely.

513
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:25,390
That's super interesting and actually may be an opportunity because of the timeline here to not follow up on it once we do our ESM, the news.

514
00:55:25,630 --> 00:55:29,230
Second postponement is interesting. Dan, thank you so much.

515
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:37,800
Let's move to the group in the front here. We want to talk. I can think of.

516
00:55:39,990 --> 00:55:45,650
Two of us chose the drivers belt, but it was interesting to hear the different things about it.

517
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:53,070
So Amy had an article from The Guardian about it where they interviewed kind of the economic impacts of local people on it.

518
00:55:54,900 --> 00:56:04,710
And I read an article from MLive, which is, if you're not from Michigan, it's like kind of the Michigan like local news stuff in the state.

519
00:56:06,150 --> 00:56:16,410
And it was actually following up on the report from Eglee, or I call it about some people that you go, Oh, it's the environmental.

520
00:56:16,410 --> 00:56:20,190
What is it? Energy. Great Lakes. I can never remember the whole thing.

521
00:56:20,790 --> 00:56:24,650
It's the environmental department in Michigan.

522
00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:30,270
And they were saying that, oh, it wasn't £4,170 of chromium.

523
00:56:30,270 --> 00:56:37,620
That was just charge. It was only £20. But we were all talking about how we find that kind of suspicious because things like

524
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:43,140
the it came out two weeks after it came out in support of opening the waterways.

525
00:56:44,550 --> 00:56:50,460
The report was saying that the chromium wasn't hexavalent chromium which is carcinogenic,

526
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:55,170
it was actually trivalent chromium and only some hexavalent chromium.

527
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:59,690
I mean, it's like positive to know that maybe it was less than it actually was.

528
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:02,810
But I don't we're all kind of still, like,

529
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:08,790
suspicious of like the company and the department and like the Department of Health and Human Services was like,

530
00:57:08,790 --> 00:57:12,750
oh, trivalent chromium is a micronutrient that we all need in our diet anyway.

531
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:18,270
So it's all good. But some good things that like, maybe are like it.

532
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:29,250
I don't know if it was only less than £20, but the article was saying that there were filters between the factory and the wastewater treatment plant,

533
00:57:29,250 --> 00:57:36,330
which does to actually came out of the wastewater treatment plant and that the carbon filters were installed for people,

534
00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:38,610
but they actually caught some of the chromium waste.

535
00:57:39,270 --> 00:57:45,060
But because of that, there's also a bunch of chromium waste now in the wastewater treatment plant that they have to figure out how to dispose of.

536
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:50,399
So yeah, it's relieving to know it might be less,

537
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:54,750
but it's also like these departments don't have a great track record because your

538
00:57:54,750 --> 00:57:59,880
articles are talking about the history of the regulations being gutted in Michigan.

539
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:04,830
Oh, thanks for sharing and cool. The two of you kind of zeroed in on a similar topic.

540
00:58:05,490 --> 00:58:12,000
Pretty strong contrast geographically, right? We're going from international Brazil to Turkey and then here a very local example, right?

541
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:20,520
This is just upstream of the Grand River, which goes right through Ann Arbor, just right back behind the group next back.

542
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:30,829
So we chose my article, which was about the infant formula shortage, the factory that caused it.

543
00:58:30,830 --> 00:58:34,590
It was here in Michigan, but it affected the whole country.

544
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:40,500
My sister and two of my friends had babies this past year, so it was like just like on my mind.

545
00:58:41,130 --> 00:58:45,980
So what caused the shortage was contamination by kernel vectors.

546
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:55,589
Exactly. And also salmonella to some degree. So this article that I chose was in Bloomberg a couple weeks ago,

547
00:58:55,590 --> 00:59:03,659
and it talked about how like how the contamination happened and it was caused coronavac like

548
00:59:03,660 --> 00:59:08,670
naturally occurs in the environment and is like naturally present in some people's bodies,

549
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:14,010
but it also thrives in like powdered milk and formula.

550
00:59:14,490 --> 00:59:26,490
So the factory in Sturgis, Michigan, had problems with lax practices like workers not washing their hands and having like cracked equipment and stuff.

551
00:59:26,970 --> 00:59:35,640
So the bacteria was able to thrive in the equipment and also it was contaminated through lack of handwashing.

552
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:42,380
So the exposure is like a biological agent, of course,

553
00:59:42,570 --> 00:59:51,630
and it's infants that were most vulnerable to this because their immune systems aren't developed.

554
00:59:51,630 --> 00:59:56,240
So that allows the bacteria to multiply and increase their exposure,

555
00:59:56,260 --> 01:00:02,940
like as opposed to an adult or an older child whose immune system would kill the bacteria before it multiplied.

556
01:00:04,950 --> 01:00:11,999
And yeah, it was like it was a sad situation because there were seven I think according to this article,

557
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:17,160
there were seven total deaths from September of last year to February of this year.

558
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:27,360
And like there were other infections and more infants and it caused like things like meningitis and sepsis.

559
01:00:28,710 --> 01:00:32,340
Oh, yeah. Excellent. Thank you so much.

560
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:35,900
So another really nice contrast. Right. So we talked about example.

561
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:40,280
Lots of chemical stressors, chemical hazards, in this case, a biological hazard.

562
01:00:40,550 --> 01:00:46,610
Right. All right. In terms of timing and with apologies to the last three groups, I don't think we're going to get a chance to do it.

563
01:00:46,620 --> 01:00:53,780
I will budget time accordingly a little bit better when we do our s in the news so that we have more time for reporting out.

564
01:00:54,260 --> 01:00:57,740
Thank you so much for your engagement. Great to see you all.

565
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:02,070
Have a good rest of your day. No.
