1
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:10,210
You know what?

2
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:17,930
I'm not trying to console all these.

3
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:40,320
All right? This is bioterrorism.

4
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:50,730
So today I'm going to give you the action and the syllabus.

5
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:56,250
And if you have questions, feel free to insult me.

6
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:16,540
So my name is John. I'm a professor of finance.

7
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:22,150
So this is session one and so on came.

8
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:31,960
Is that included? I just got to be on hand. And we had just ask this semester how you get the activity.

9
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:40,060
So the emails are listed here. So if you have questions, so actually you can email and help us.

10
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:45,970
So, so first of note.

11
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:53,770
So if you send emails to us, please always include I was at 602 in the subject.

12
00:01:54,670 --> 00:02:05,680
This is very important because we have so many students and it's hard for me to know your name, especially in the beginning.

13
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:12,460
So if you do not include on this subject and then these your email, because I get many emails.

14
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:17,640
Okay. So if you want to get response in time.

15
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:25,620
So remember, this is no secret because I kind of I canceled my second question.

16
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:30,130
The idea of 30 emails at every day to see if I missed anything.

17
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:39,010
So this is something to keep in mind. And as it is, please double check the email address.

18
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:50,550
So do not use the matt edu account because some students actually they use these email accounts.

19
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,800
But I do not check this email regularly.

20
00:02:54,160 --> 00:03:06,220
So if you send emails to the mad account and then your email also very important so that actually several people at UB.

21
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:12,970
So these may these the exact same name as me and also may have similar name.

22
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:17,470
So so some student actually sent email to the wrong person.

23
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:23,110
And so I remember in one semester so a student as the end of the semester,

24
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:28,740
she told me I never responded to her email, the task of which email address used.

25
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:32,720
Then she said Email to the wrong person the whole semester.

26
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:38,190
So it's very important. And actually sometimes I get emails from another person being similarly.

27
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:42,100
So, so it's very important you check the email address.

28
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:50,620
So this is the email address I used. And so sometimes missed you miss your email.

29
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:56,230
So if you don't get response in seven days, it's okay to email me again.

30
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:06,060
It's okay to remind me. And if you don't get a response, like for a very, very long time, it's probably that you send emails with a.

31
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:23,390
So the lectures are lecture awarded to them as though they haven't been.

32
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:28,340
So we're going to take a ten minute break in the middle.

33
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:34,640
So we will start at 1:00. So the office hours.

34
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:40,160
So. So let's email any person here.

35
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:45,580
And also, if you you can also go to an office.

36
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:53,060
All of that is convenient to you. So in my office, all of this in two days lead to a format for us.

37
00:04:53,600 --> 00:05:01,160
And so by this, I will have another office all of the same.

38
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:05,690
So this is enclosed and this is, as you said,

39
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:15,350
you are sitting bequeathed a little bit of either doing in tumblers and copies, not have the actual office hours to here.

40
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:22,720
These are all in-person. Also, the office hours are, I guess, eyes.

41
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:31,800
So the location. So. So the office hours, you start next week.

42
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:41,360
So this week we will not have office hour. So we are going to resume the room and we are going to tell you the location through our colors.

43
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:53,230
So in this class, you're going to have long required textbooks.

44
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,440
So this the same textbook you use for six, seven.

45
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:03,850
So the statistics influence comes out of the book. Also, the optional violence.

46
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:07,900
If you want to get more exercise, you can you can take a look at this.

47
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:11,920
One of the topics is the color.

48
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:16,690
It's basically in chapter six to chapter ten of the textbook.

49
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:28,150
So in this class, we're going to talk about data reduction because that is odds on chapter six, the median talk about a point estimation.

50
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:38,770
So how we can estimate an unknown parameter as that in Chapter seven and chapter ten is a talk about hypothesis testing.

51
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:44,200
Chapter eight And we would talk about interval estimation.

52
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:49,720
So these are the four main topics that we call in this class.

53
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:57,070
So this is about the structure of this class.

54
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,630
So the trauma side.

55
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:06,750
So they use homicide a lot. So you need to check the covers regularly.

56
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:11,830
So. So should sample the slides.

57
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:16,510
So I will post the slides on campus before lectures.

58
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:27,160
So I will update this regularly. So on the PDF files view view be uploaded before and after.

59
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:32,430
So all the files. So they may have saw this.

60
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,250
So I do not have all the details.

61
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:45,760
So Song, for example, is I have the details of solutions already on their first lesson examples, and they leave the solution blank.

62
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,240
So during the lecture, I will fill in the gaps.

63
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:57,640
So I will write. I don't hate the slides. And then after the class, I will post the annotated slides on my.

64
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:06,630
Time for the nachos. So I will try to recall nachos and then to cover.

65
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:13,410
It's not guaranteed. Sometimes you have some technical difficulty.

66
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:18,050
The lecture may not be successfully recorded. So you think so?

67
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,220
I think you are still in to control nachos.

68
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:29,600
Because if I cannot guarantee the lecture, it will be all the time.

69
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:39,470
And also, if you come to the lectures, it provides an opportunity to interact with me on the whole world.

70
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:44,870
So. So the assignment will be posted on Thomas Weekly.

71
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:55,200
So what I'm going to do is I'm actually going to post the homework all day every week and is do the next.

72
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:57,380
This is my plan.

73
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:08,420
And I may change because sometimes a classmate, because this is a winter semester, sometimes a class may be canceled due to severe weather.

74
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:19,040
And in this case, I may have to adjust my schedule as my class is that every assigned homework all Sunday and is due the next day.

75
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:24,920
And if anything changes your post, you make an announcement to us.

76
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:34,730
So you need to check how to regularly. And also we will have to examine how the B12 and we will have a final.

77
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:47,970
So homicides until you posted an actual slide on logs and solutions and advancement and other resources.

78
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:55,090
Yes. We submitted an assignment on canvas or lighting paper through canvas.

79
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:07,210
So these are important dates. So the first session today and the midterm.

80
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:14,260
So let me talk in the February 23rd in class here and then this.

81
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,520
I think of this that this date is the day before the break.

82
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:26,390
So so what we are going to do is also do how we turn this day.

83
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:32,860
This is a full day. And on Tuesday of that week, we will not cover new topics.

84
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:38,770
Instead, I'm going to give you a route that is not record.

85
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:44,320
And so on this date, there will be no lecture.

86
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,660
So so October 28th and the March 2nd.

87
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:54,250
So they say that the winter breaks there will be no fuss.

88
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:59,860
And also on March 21st. So this is until today.

89
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:03,850
So this class will be canceled due to a conference.

90
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:10,600
And the last lecture is on Tuesday, April 18th.

91
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:19,390
So the final exam date is already fixed. So this is the Wednesday, April 26, 4 to 6 p.m.

92
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,440
So we will not be able to attend the final exam date.

93
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:41,670
So because this is first class. So you may wonder whether this is a right class for, you know, so the prerequisite for this class is X or Y.

94
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:52,320
Or you could have the knowledge. So basically, you need to have good knowledge for Chapter 11 to file a case on the puzzle.

95
00:11:53,010 --> 00:12:03,330
And also you need to have you need to refresh your calculus and a little bit of about matrix algebra.

96
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:13,140
But the main issue with algebra are not math owning an account which would prove matrix to be the simple.

97
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:17,940
The basic concept is mostly about calculus.

98
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:27,630
So so if you have taken care of this a long time ago, it's a good idea to refresh your memory to actually rule on the.

99
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:33,360
So if you have concerns whether this is the right class to you,

100
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:40,860
I think the best bit is contact me so I can talk with you if you're in the office all of the time that I.

101
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:49,500
But for you email me schedule on time to talk about the grading.

102
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:54,450
So so as I said, there will be about weekly homework.

103
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:58,830
So it will account for 20% of your final grade.

104
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:04,510
All right. Talk about this. The whole is assigned area also.

105
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:16,710
So I'm starting next week. For this week, I will not assign your homework and let me to on a final so divide in 40% for each each one of them.

106
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:23,160
And so the exam on the fourth is similar in format rule of 6 to 1.

107
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:28,440
So it's going to be a class exam.

108
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:34,800
And so the details we will talk about the details of when you get close to the exam date.

109
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:43,230
So we will not be able to have make up become all final.

110
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:54,450
So if you have to maze the exam for legitimate reasons, then then you will not receive the score.

111
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:59,970
But we will change our vote accordingly when we calculate your final grade.

112
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:05,790
But you have to have a good reason to miss exam.

113
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:11,490
For example, if you have a medical reason, then you need to provide me with evidence.

114
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:15,420
The documented medical reason for documented medical check.

115
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:20,910
And if you miss the exam for no good reason.

116
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:34,060
Then the grade will be counted either. Zero. So about.

117
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:41,590
So this is about the academic academic integrity.

118
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:53,050
So. So in this class. So the honor code is also close so that you can review the code here.

119
00:14:54,070 --> 00:15:04,660
So I want to say something about the homework. So in the homework, the main purpose is to give you an opportunity to practice what you have learned.

120
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:11,650
So the main purpose, inartful evaluation. So it is okay to discuss the homework because your classmate.

121
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:20,320
And I think in this class we have stop and think you have that the facilitator has a total tool.

122
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:27,129
So you on to do homework together. However, it's not okay just to share your piece.

123
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:30,880
You have homework and then you copy. That is not okay.

124
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:34,510
So if you had a you should be based on your understanding.

125
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:41,950
So on also are usually I will not accept late homework.

126
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:46,260
So you you need to remember submit your homework in time.

127
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:52,540
But if you are six that week and if you so you if you have some special reason and

128
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:59,500
you want to extend the deadline for a short period times day one or two days.

129
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:06,280
So it's okay to ask you for the due date and I may accommodate that.

130
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,650
I cannot do that for many times.

131
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:17,920
So probably like I during the whole semester, I can do that for you for for once or probably almost twice if you have a good reason.

132
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:26,470
So, yeah. So if you if you are sick, if you have some other special reason, it's okay to email me and ask for extension.

133
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:38,560
Normally you only get one chance. You need to give, make you feel like ha if you are sick and then you are very you cannot do anything about it.

134
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:45,640
So I you try to be reasonable, as I said, as opportunity does the homework and not use for evaluation.

135
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:50,730
Mostly useful to give. To give you an opportunity to.

136
00:16:55,190 --> 00:17:02,510
So I would encourage you to participate during the class.

137
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:11,720
So asking question in class is very encouraging because we have a big class.

138
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,070
You have a big classroom.

139
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:25,700
So so I know some people may they may feel that they may not want to ask a question during the class or they may also be during the break.

140
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:29,690
But actually, it's more encouraged to ask you a question during the class,

141
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:39,950
because sometimes even if you if you are confused about a concept, it's good tool for me to clarify the point immediately.

142
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:45,740
If you have if you are confused, most likely other students also have similar questions.

143
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:51,590
So yeah, I so I want to say this, I want to emphasize this.

144
00:17:51,840 --> 00:18:01,430
So you are very welcome to ask questions during the class, and if so, I'm honored as all of them in class.

145
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:06,950
So if I see you is takes a longer time to answer the questions that you feel, but ask a very and deep question.

146
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:09,860
I feel I cannot give you a good answer right away.

147
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:19,430
So I may tell you that everything about this and you talk about this next time, as a lot of times the questions are the simple clarifying questions.

148
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:24,049
And those questions, I think I will answer those right away.

149
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:32,450
And that is very good to ask. And also so interacting, very important.

150
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:39,890
So you're very encouraged to discuss your fellow students and also on joining up with all of us.

151
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:47,230
So you have a D class. So it is difficult for me to remember.

152
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:51,770
I remember you from the beginning if you come in talks with me.

153
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:57,230
So if I interact with you in person, it's easy for me to get to know you.

154
00:18:57,650 --> 00:19:07,610
And also the feedback so important for me. For example, sometimes if I'm just talking, I do not know whether the speed is okay.

155
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:14,420
So you may feel like I'm talking to a fast and if no one tells me so, I would keep talking very fast.

156
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:24,980
And if you ask me questions, then I may slow down and I will realize, oh, so this is a difficult concept and people need more time to think about it.

157
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:34,190
So yeah, so, so it's very important to interrupt me, ask me questions during the class.

158
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:40,070
So I think that is about the hour about this class.

159
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:47,360
So, so before we talk about the class materials, are any questions so far?

160
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:54,890
And costumes. All right.

161
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:59,170
So then we will continue. And if you think about something, let me know.

162
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:07,630
So. So what is our statistical inference for you in this class?

163
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:13,170
We will talk about statistical first. So. So.

164
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:17,700
So why we are. So why do you want to know?

165
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:20,980
Inference. So. So. So. Very.

166
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:29,260
So statistics. Inference is very important because it is the foundation of most statistics.

167
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:36,760
So. So for all the material, you know, you all the class, actually,

168
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:42,970
you may need the theory as a foundation, and this class will provide you the foundation.

169
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:53,020
And so to me, if, for example, I feel like the most important class for me is six over six and two,

170
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,220
because I'm so focused on class alone, that's material.

171
00:20:57,370 --> 00:21:00,429
I may not use it in the future. I may. I may not.

172
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:03,760
Because if you all have all a field, you all have all expertise.

173
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:12,280
So not all materials actually use them, but six 7% to 36 Social Sciences Conference.

174
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:15,820
I feel like I already use that. So.

175
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:19,629
So no matter what I do. So. So.

176
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:28,090
No matter which area I look at local. So this is a foundation and the using the building blocks in this class.

177
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:32,980
So in principle, you'll be able to build something cool, something new on your own.

178
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:36,850
So. So you saw these, almost all of them.

179
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:43,070
You may be interested in doing a piece. And for your piece, you need to do research.

180
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:48,430
You need to come up with a new statistical method, and especially for those new things.

181
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:54,430
And you have the theory you need to have the foundation in order to build something on you.

182
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:02,780
And even if you do not do it, Kristie, you may think that I don't have to come up with something.

183
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:06,550
I want to use it as a tool and as data.

184
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:14,080
So feel that you need knowledge here to fully understand the concept before those lessons,

185
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:18,460
but you give you a better understanding of the existing method.

186
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:29,320
So as a graduate student in biostatistics after it is 1530, I think very important.

187
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:36,010
So if so, what is it that is popular for this show?

188
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:45,490
So this conference is about drawing conclusions on underlying distribution of data.

189
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:54,220
So what we do as a statistician, what we do is we have data on the form, the data we want to know from the data.

190
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:58,780
And we want to know knowledge upon the data so we can advance science.

191
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:06,640
So so the statistic influence is actually the brute collecting and connecting the data to the science.

192
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:18,550
So you have your data. Your data is basically from clinical trials or maybe from survey or maybe from observational study.

193
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:24,850
So you have your data, this data, the logical conclusion. You have a lot of data how to make sense of the data.

194
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:29,500
So you use your statistical cameras. So a lot of message here.

195
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:34,300
The you the message here. And then we try to make a conclusion.

196
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:40,060
We try to inform the underlying science so that in a statistical universe.

197
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:44,950
So so basically it is a way to understand aspect from intelligence.

198
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:48,480
And you can now look at all of that.

199
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:51,819
All the data is the part of the data what you want.

200
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:55,930
We can follow it much bigger than what you actually see from the data.

201
00:23:57,130 --> 00:24:10,450
This is our statistical inference. So I think I just give you a big picture about what is our statistic inference.

202
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:16,960
So now I'm going to be more concrete and then you can see the connection.

203
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,300
And a difference is between sixth over and a sixth or two.

204
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:26,800
So specifically. So in inference.

205
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,200
So this is a process.

206
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:40,570
So this is a process of drawing conclusions or making a statement about a population based or random sample of data for that population.

207
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:49,840
So what do I mean by this? So, for example, if you want to know the the height.

208
00:24:51,820 --> 00:25:00,220
Population. Right. So you are your population of interest is all the people in the world.

209
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:07,030
So that is your population. However, you're not going to measure the five for every person in the whole population.

210
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:13,180
Usually what we do is we just draw one the sample data from that population from the on a sample.

211
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:21,550
We want to know, for example, what is the average height, what is what is the type of arresting about this population?

212
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:32,499
And also, for example, if you want to know the proportion of a population so that your population could be as up and you need to fire your public,

213
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:41,950
are you sure that you do a statistical inference, for example, and may be interested in patients who have advanced heart failure?

214
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:48,490
In this case, the population of interest is patient, V is advised coffee.

215
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:58,660
And among these patient the population. I want to know the terrorists because I want to know they are EMI.

216
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:03,880
I want to know if they are hypertension. I want to know the hemoglobin.

217
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:10,830
But so this is the population. And I want to know that based on the data ourselves.

218
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:14,770
So your data is just a random sample from that time to these days.

219
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:19,930
So this is about inference and what is data.

220
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:31,929
So, so we may use the lower case to denote the realization of the random variables so that no case X the bottle x,

221
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:40,660
that is the data, you know, the zone. So a quick for example, it could be 010 la la la la la, something like this.

222
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:47,390
And this tells you whether this person in, for example, has hypertension or not.

223
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:56,770
So this is the realization. And if you use the capsule that of a counter that to denote the random variables.

224
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:06,730
So if you call this this an X about externally the random sample files, some population of interest.

225
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:13,800
And for example, this one, this number, they could be independent and identical distribution of saw distribution.

226
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:20,140
So the X ones were access to the independent and the independent normal distribution.

227
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:28,360
Or they they may not also solve a lot of the exams of the x this class.

228
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:33,520
So they could be independent. But yes, although these are structured, they may not be independent.

229
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:39,520
So, I mean, you they usually we specify this.

230
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:46,999
So, for example, if you have a class the data, so for example,

231
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:53,170
if you have patient for a class to a visiting hospitals and the patient up front for the hospital,

232
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:57,760
I mean, no data for the same hospital did not expect it to be independent.

233
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:03,100
So so sometimes in the structure, your data, like in this class,

234
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:09,910
we try to make it seem simple so that over time I wasn't running a sample extraction to access the I.V.

235
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:28,980
So I'm going to give you some based on notation you may use in this class.

236
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:34,710
I think you may know that you already know one in six over just one before they're all here.

237
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:44,639
So I'm familiar with them. So I want to do X.

238
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:52,709
And so this is a vector that each one of them is a random variable on a for rather variable,

239
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:58,500
you know, unless it's a lot of that area or whether it's continuous or it has a categorical,

240
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:09,330
you may describe the distribution using the probability density function, PDF or the probability mass function.

241
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:27,170
So here I use this to denote. So I use.

242
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:47,040
And in fact. I could.

243
00:29:57,850 --> 00:30:01,450
So I'm someone that is not bold.

244
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:05,320
So this isn't a distribution for a single random variable.

245
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:10,810
So. So here, suppose I assume they all have the same distribution.

246
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:18,040
So this just means that the bottom has this distribution as to how this distribution and all of them have this distribution.

247
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:21,550
And this is the distribution for a single random variable.

248
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:29,230
And. And I use lowercase to denote the data.

249
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:37,780
So this is the realization on the run of variables. So if you example the x bar and two X, then they could be a binary distribution.

250
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:42,670
And so the reason that they know would be a list of zeros are the ones.

251
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:46,720
So these are zeros and ones. So these are realizations.

252
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:53,140
So although the value of the random variables. And so I can use.

253
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:59,770
So for simplicity and use the bold level who didn't know about us.

254
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:11,140
So here. So the bold x means the vector x was two x because it difficult for me to write all the letters.

255
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:15,280
So I can't write these.

256
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:20,200
Well, I view the notes next. And they use these.

257
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:24,930
So if. Oh.

258
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:36,310
Usually in the first day cause I have this kind of issues since it's difficult for me to write.

259
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:56,630
So yeah. So when I ride the Toyota and the these is the X, this means that she has a bullet x and I don't know why it keeps moving.

260
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:13,390
So similarly when law case law spent.

261
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:33,760
Now the. Not an easy for me to write anything about this later.

262
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:42,040
So if I you each cover I use lowercase, then this means the realization.

263
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:51,120
Yeah. So. So the the boat ads.

264
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:59,070
So this is one example of a population and then the job distribution of this vector denoted as these.

265
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:03,960
So again, I'm using so the X is the default.

266
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:06,780
So this means this in the target speech of the whole vector.

267
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:19,170
And so if I assume the random variables of the I.D., then you're not so bad that the joint distribution is the product of the distribution.

268
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:23,730
And here this is the master distribution for a single random variable.

269
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:27,300
So is it evaluated at each particular x?

270
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:39,010
So also. So because in our distribution, so usually we will have some prime examples.

271
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:44,200
If you have normal distribution, you will have an account that is AMU and a Sigma script for that.

272
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:48,850
So your your view is the mean Sigma Square in the variances.

273
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:52,330
So I use She-Hulk, you know, the producer.

274
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:56,560
So, so for example, for normal distribution.

275
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:07,160
So you will have new on a Sigma Square. So they'll see that Becka D.A., the Vector Community,

276
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:16,120
will know this and see that is the prime that you are usually the setup will belong to some private the.

277
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:27,400
For example here then the see that belong to Euclidean space of dimension to the notation and whatnot.

278
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:35,660
Jodie. So far.

279
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:45,350
Any questions? And then what are the differences?

280
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:49,030
What is the key differences between six of our people?

281
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:59,260
So in 611, what we do is we assume that we already know them.

282
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:11,840
And then we try to make a probabilistic statement about the random variable x an x x that I'm going to give an example data,

283
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,710
a six so tool that actually doing the opposite.

284
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:22,580
So six so tool. So what our goal is to learn and not pregnancy.

285
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:26,990
So this means that we do not let me see the data.

286
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:31,040
We do not know the value of the true value of the privacy.

287
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:37,040
And instead, we try to use the data to learn about the two problems.

288
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:45,679
And I see that it's exactly the opposite. So in six of our you already know theta and no, you see.

289
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:50,530
Huh. You want to make a statement about running very and six.

290
00:35:50,600 --> 00:36:01,790
So true. We already see the data and if you want to use the film, you have to load or to guess what is the true private of of.

291
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:10,800
So if this is still abstract to you, so let's see an example.

292
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,350
So this is a typical six alarm question.

293
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:22,240
So for example, in six, so by the time so I'm asking the question everything.

294
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:34,830
So if I have a sample and if I have a random variable X, so x and if the idea of Aurora distribution in the time p zero.

295
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:40,230
So if example this p zero would be 150.2.

296
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:44,310
I tell you, this is a constant. This is a normal constant.

297
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:55,110
So I could ask you, what is the probability that this formation of X is less than you go to an X or Y, you can answer this question.

298
00:36:55,410 --> 00:37:06,930
How do you do that? Because you know that if each x i in the following distribution is this parameter and that's the summation of X,

299
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:17,759
I would have a by normal distribution in the prime and appear and then in front of my normal distribution, you know, the probability mass function.

300
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:24,270
No, the amount and the immediately use of GMF to kind of this probability and this

301
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:31,170
probability and here and then you have you the constant P zero so has p 0.503 rep.

302
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:37,230
So you see that is six so far. So we are so we assume knowledge about the constant p zero.

303
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:43,590
I tell you what this number is and then you tell me what is the probability for this event.

304
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:50,250
So the U of this knowledge, if you calculate the probability of an event.

305
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:55,799
So this is what you learn in six. Go back. Now in six.

306
00:37:55,800 --> 00:38:00,330
O'Toole We did the opposite. We do the opposite. So.

307
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:09,440
So in six. So four, actually, we already observe the realization of X, right?

308
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:15,730
So this has the character excited, the run, the variables, the data is lowercase, x minus x and the other data.

309
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:19,770
You are ready obviously when the lowercase x is zero of that.

310
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:26,790
So we have a list of x, at least a lot of zeros, but I do not know what is the probability.

311
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:35,580
I do not know the probability of this distribution at the p so so a full for the page in advance half billion.

312
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:41,820
I do not know whether they are obese or not, but what are the probability that they are obese?

313
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:46,340
The one in the probability they have no other comorbidity.

314
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:56,490
So. So I want to estimate that probability I and I want to know what probability some of them know about this unknown prime the p so is six so true.

315
00:38:56,790 --> 00:39:01,320
We do not know the value of the unknown parameter we want to use.

316
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:04,760
The data we will learn all about is unknown prime.

317
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:15,650
So this is the opposite of me. So first of so what you should do is if you have a data of a node experiment, well,

318
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:26,940
from a clinical trial or for an observational study and you see the data and then based on the data, I may want to assume a model for that data.

319
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:38,370
So for example, what do I mean by model? I mean assume that my data in front of my data is, say, brand pressure.

320
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:42,750
So I might assume that the broad pressure higher than normal distribution.

321
00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:46,170
So these are the normal distribution is my model.

322
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:54,330
And I assumed well, no, I know I can assume that in following all the distribution, but I do not know the meaning of the normal distribution.

323
00:39:54,540 --> 00:40:05,070
I do not know the variance of normal distribution. The message is a new and a signal square coming from saw Euclidean space.

324
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:11,790
Then I want to use the data to make inference about amu on a sigma.

325
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:22,350
So here. So the normal distribution was. The other distribution is in my model in this class, most of time we will consider parametric model.

326
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:29,490
So what do I mean by parametric model. So on the P, so as I said, if, for example, the, the C,

327
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:41,670
how would the view on a Sigma Square and in this case is it belongs to the Euclidean space of dimension to this case.

328
00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:48,990
So when the P and the dimension in the finite I causes a parametric a model.

329
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:57,569
So sometimes the amount again too complicated here in that and your p actually in infinite dimensional space.

330
00:40:57,570 --> 00:41:03,460
A long chromatic example if I say I have data on this data in continuous and.

331
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:07,170
Any distribution included in normal distribution quality,

332
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:17,060
expanded distribution could be available to switch out and distribution as long as it has a PDF in this case is still a model,

333
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:20,540
is not a paramedical model. It's a very, very big model.

334
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:28,100
So you do not know the the paramedical forum on the distribution so that in a non-pandemic model by using this class you don't have to.

335
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:37,690
Yeah. So you just need to have a very basic idea, a rough idea, intuitive.

336
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:42,470
I said this intuitively. In this class we will usually see the apparent medical model.

337
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:50,650
It means it is fine distribution. You can write down the PDF, you just know primarily a PDF.

338
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:55,580
So that is that is a potential model. These are not normal distribution in the provisional model.

339
00:41:55,940 --> 00:42:01,090
Exponential distribution is a parent medical model and a binary distribution in the parent national order.

340
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:05,570
But we may also talk about a non permission model.

341
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:13,400
So it just the focus is on permission model. So so for example here so that acts to be absolutely distribution.

342
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:20,960
So I wonder in this patient what are the probability they will be obese.

343
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:30,190
Right. So then I can't so obese or not have you model as a bodily distribution and then you want to know the probability, see.

344
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:35,420
So see if you are no parameter, you model non this unknown time but from your data.

345
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:43,760
So in this case we see that we will collect data in order to estimate, see and estimate see.

346
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:49,879
That just means that you want to make a guess about see what do the probability is?

347
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:53,330
Is that the high or low?

348
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:59,060
So could it be like 80% of the obese or in 100% of the obese?

349
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:07,430
So I do not know this even at like data to estimate that and for estimation we call this point estimation or an estimate.

350
00:43:07,430 --> 00:43:13,070
It just means that you want to come up with the best guess about see them.

351
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:30,050
And also we may want to perform test a hypotheses about them so it is equal to 1.5 or not or whether you say how much drug

352
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:43,280
consumed are hypertension and if all the so you can measure the pressure before the treatment and after the treatment.

353
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:50,000
And you may ask whether after the treatment the growth increased or not.

354
00:43:50,270 --> 00:44:02,240
So you may test the see. So if you use to quantify the differences, the meaning of the differences, you may ask whether the seed is less than zero.

355
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:10,910
So you can perform has a positive, the positive or the we may want to construct positive into the placebo example.

356
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:19,400
Sometimes I do not I, I want to so my best guess about in point eight.

357
00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:24,200
So I say like 80% of people would be obese in this population.

358
00:44:24,770 --> 00:44:31,040
But I know that it's very unlikely that you will have your guess.

359
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:35,179
Exactly. You can tell the truth. You may want to have a comfort interval.

360
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:42,049
So this so I will just say like a poverty that shows you that will be between 0.7, 2.9.

361
00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:46,940
So that is your comment interval about serum and the also based on your see how you know of I'll

362
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:52,910
see the they want to make predictions about future data so these are the same we want to do.

363
00:44:53,090 --> 00:45:01,850
When we do statistical inference you'll see that all of these you all of these on task basically we just want a lot of you.

364
00:45:01,970 --> 00:45:05,330
We just want one. We want to know what is the right.

365
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:08,900
So we use the data you want to learn about CRM.

366
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:23,260
So this is what we do in six or two and we will know so we know the the method, this kind of how the kind of help us to achieve this goal.

367
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:37,640
So these are some examples of questions we have to answer using the message that we believe is central.

368
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:46,820
So about, for example, point estimation. So what is the probability of a head of head in a series of observed, a coin tosses.

369
00:45:47,150 --> 00:45:50,770
So coin doesn't have had telltale tail.

370
00:45:51,170 --> 00:46:00,210
This is a google thing for us. So this is the lowercase lowercase x so far in the data you want to guess what is it?

371
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:01,020
So this.

372
00:46:01,370 --> 00:46:09,770
Then you can come up with a model direct to your model for this data would be a balloon of distribution, a wonderful bit of this baloney distribution.

373
00:46:09,890 --> 00:46:19,530
So that is you are no prime to see and that you have estimated this data facts and also you may perform test of hypotheses about them.

374
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:26,240
So even a series of twin classes can tell when the coin is biased or not.

375
00:46:26,630 --> 00:46:32,850
So basically you want to test whether the theta equal to half.

376
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:42,710
So you have a test. You may accept your hypothesis or you may reject you have positive you may want because you are confident into the book here.

377
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:49,190
So what is a probable range of true probability of even the data that you observe?

378
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:58,460
And you may want to make a prediction about future data. So given the data that you will predict, what is the outcome of the next coin toss?

379
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:03,580
So when you make predictions, you'll want to use your knowledge of them.

380
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:08,080
So these are questions to be answered using six to.

381
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:19,520
So this is our introduction about this class.

382
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:27,050
Um, I think we're going to take a ten minute break.

383
00:47:27,530 --> 00:47:35,300
They're going to come back at time for. This is.

384
00:47:53,270 --> 00:48:04,449
Just three months ago. He was supposed to be all right the first time.

385
00:48:23,774 --> 00:48:33,944
So I just gave you an overview about what statistical inference is and what is the key differences between six over 602.

386
00:48:34,604 --> 00:48:46,394
So today we're going to start the the first topic in this in this class.

387
00:48:46,844 --> 00:48:50,594
So that is about data reduction.

388
00:48:51,804 --> 00:48:58,724
So I will explain what is data reduction and a, what goals to achieve for data reduction.

389
00:49:02,444 --> 00:49:06,704
So so as I said, we have our data.

390
00:49:06,884 --> 00:49:10,844
So this is already observing the way you do a data analysis.

391
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:21,124
You already have your data and we then use the lower case exabytes or x n to denote the realization of the run, the variable x five.

392
00:49:24,444 --> 00:49:27,504
Our data could be very, very big.

393
00:49:28,044 --> 00:49:33,564
So for example, I could be 10,000 and if will attend saw the patient.

394
00:49:33,864 --> 00:49:38,544
You may record whether the patient had hypertension or not.

395
00:49:39,234 --> 00:49:48,064
Sassou nguesso zero of us. You may not want to keep all the data in a lot of inflammation.

396
00:49:48,564 --> 00:49:53,604
Right? And how can you guys summarize all the data such that it is true?

397
00:49:54,864 --> 00:50:01,164
Now, I don't ask you the information because that is what we are achieved through data reduction.

398
00:50:01,674 --> 00:50:08,754
So mathematically, what we want to do is we want to define a function of the data.

399
00:50:09,354 --> 00:50:15,234
So we are always sending in X. The ones who accept the dimension of the original data is often.

400
00:50:15,624 --> 00:50:23,003
So this media space is the measurement. And now you want to define a function, a function, he said.

401
00:50:23,004 --> 00:50:31,164
Here in a function, they call you, for example, the summation of all the exercise and so forth.

402
00:50:31,284 --> 00:50:35,304
Defining the function with dimension of your data is much smaller.

403
00:50:35,754 --> 00:50:40,104
So we based this new summary on the data is simpler than original data.

404
00:50:40,794 --> 00:50:51,294
So kind of mean by simpler. So the new dimension be an equal or smaller than for example, you have a series of 0 to 1, right?

405
00:50:51,354 --> 00:51:06,074
And you can give all of the have a capital on other than you tell them that among the among modern patient I only have ten of them not equal.

406
00:51:06,804 --> 00:51:09,834
So that is the summation of the zero one.

407
00:51:10,194 --> 00:51:19,673
So now a single number obviously is much simpler than a reason that they have the original data has a numbers and now is a single number.

408
00:51:19,674 --> 00:51:25,104
Your B that you measure one now simply does not mean physical try.

409
00:51:25,194 --> 00:51:29,544
So it could be that you have lost a lot of information.

410
00:51:29,814 --> 00:51:34,674
It's that the new summary is not very informative.

411
00:51:35,574 --> 00:51:44,214
So. So actually that who we want to achieve something is the first goal is you want it to be simple.

412
00:51:45,144 --> 00:51:52,584
And the second goal is we want to keep all the information about ACA that is contained in original data.

413
00:51:53,004 --> 00:51:59,904
So this means that I do not want to lose information. I want to keep all the information about either the hours they have.

414
00:52:00,444 --> 00:52:07,524
But simply, if I can achieve the two goals and maintain the C, then I have come up with a good start.

415
00:52:09,494 --> 00:52:15,894
So. So like I have 10,000 patient zero ones.

416
00:52:16,104 --> 00:52:22,874
If I tell them that ten of them is bad, that it tells me everything because this is good enough.

417
00:52:22,884 --> 00:52:28,364
I don't have to tell people by the list because of end zero or not because that is over.

418
00:52:28,524 --> 00:52:33,954
I just tell them that I'm a total impatient. Yeah, I know that.

419
00:52:35,184 --> 00:52:40,744
Intuitively, I would say this probably keeps all the information about that.

420
00:52:40,764 --> 00:52:43,594
What? What what do you think? Intuitively, they have.

421
00:52:43,614 --> 00:52:51,494
And you have a way to to know whether it's good summary or not at this point doing that, it's going to be the same subject.

422
00:52:51,624 --> 00:52:56,544
Right? So. Ah, yeah.

423
00:52:56,604 --> 00:53:04,494
So the fourth, I mean what we want to understand is that I want to define what data reduction, I want to achieve two goals.

424
00:53:04,554 --> 00:53:10,254
First, it is simple. The second degree is that it do not lose the information.

425
00:53:10,674 --> 00:53:15,624
So so mathematically, how do I come up with the first summary?

426
00:53:15,834 --> 00:53:20,634
So we define the summary. I defining a function.

427
00:53:20,814 --> 00:53:24,014
This is a function. T is a function that could be many functions.

428
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:29,574
For example, it will be the summation of the exercise. It would be the average of exercise.

429
00:53:30,154 --> 00:53:34,494
It could be the first number for the X amendment sum.

430
00:53:34,524 --> 00:53:38,514
It could be the minimum exact be the maximum, except that many, many functions.

431
00:53:38,904 --> 00:53:43,944
Not all the functions are useful. A good so.

432
00:53:44,994 --> 00:53:49,674
So we have a name for this function and we call this a statistic.

433
00:53:50,304 --> 00:53:59,124
So the keys is ah so that actually it doesn't matter whether you lower case or capital case,

434
00:53:59,634 --> 00:54:06,954
the capital letter because what we care is about the summary where the function p they will suffer.

435
00:54:07,374 --> 00:54:22,644
So because of what is the function. So if so so if you care about this t and we can use a t x so x will because you t the polar letter x and so this.

436
00:54:22,724 --> 00:54:28,694
As a statistic in the function of the run the variables x, malcolm x and prior.

437
00:54:29,004 --> 00:54:38,174
So far you noted that you x violence and run the variable and then poked itself in the run a variable that we agree.

438
00:54:39,194 --> 00:54:46,454
So suppose X under the operative distribution and he the summation of the polluted distribution to the function rat

439
00:54:46,454 --> 00:54:54,314
t in a function of the exercise or exit and the summation of the registration is that a binomial distribution?

440
00:54:54,974 --> 00:54:58,093
So you need to realize that the top x.

441
00:54:58,094 --> 00:55:04,424
So this statistic means that you find that he that he can be any function that he is so is also

442
00:55:04,724 --> 00:55:14,984
a random variable is random and the t he finds a form of data reduction or data sampling.

443
00:55:15,414 --> 00:55:22,394
So how do I understand the second statement here? So I'm going to use the example to see how you find the sentences.

444
00:55:22,694 --> 00:55:29,024
So actually, once you defined the function, he already defined a full data reduction or data summary.

445
00:55:29,234 --> 00:55:35,923
I'm not saying a good summary, but a lot when you define a function in the gave you a summary and it means that

446
00:55:35,924 --> 00:55:41,654
details reduction and the main job they're going to see whether he suffered or not.

447
00:55:43,154 --> 00:55:52,994
So like this I look at this example the total of I have run the variable X about to accept representing a series of unemployed horses.

448
00:55:53,804 --> 00:55:57,554
So the x I so so is zero or one.

449
00:55:58,004 --> 00:56:03,044
So it's a it's a ballot institution. I propose any statistic t of x.

450
00:56:04,934 --> 00:56:11,794
And a statistic. And the training function is a statistic in a comparable anything.

451
00:56:12,224 --> 00:56:22,604
I'm not I'm not asking you to propose something good and just ask him to propose some proportion of the proportion it has.

452
00:56:22,814 --> 00:56:27,414
So if I write this in terms of function, the proportion is of.

453
00:56:28,714 --> 00:56:42,784
So okay, so what you propose is actually X is equal to x, y, x and over.

454
00:56:43,294 --> 00:56:48,874
So this is a function. So this is the function of x amount of x that they are full at in a statistic.

455
00:56:49,234 --> 00:56:52,384
Thank you. Any other ideas? And as a proposal.

456
00:56:55,214 --> 00:57:04,434
The submission. Yes. I'm Asian. Yeah. Oh.

457
00:57:05,124 --> 00:57:13,134
What about this? It is a statistic. McGregor So this is the minimum order statistics that.

458
00:57:13,464 --> 00:57:19,524
So this is actually the minimum of access to access.

459
00:57:19,614 --> 00:57:23,683
So therefore it is also some from the data that is and also data reduction.

460
00:57:23,684 --> 00:57:28,554
It is also surprising that, you know, you can come up with anything.

461
00:57:28,824 --> 00:57:31,934
So what about this? So.

462
00:57:32,164 --> 00:57:36,984
So on that here. So if I probe if my here x is equal to all.

463
00:57:38,604 --> 00:57:43,644
x1x2x.

464
00:57:44,364 --> 00:57:50,024
What about this? Is this a data summary? So first of all, is this a statistic?

465
00:57:53,874 --> 00:57:58,494
Yes, I see. I see that. And the statistic I saw these three statistics.

466
00:57:59,874 --> 00:58:09,024
It reduced the data dimension a lot that you had a reader, you have own data point as it came in the fourth quarter,

467
00:58:09,234 --> 00:58:12,294
the summation or the main order statistic, you get one data.

468
00:58:12,534 --> 00:58:15,764
So one data obviously is much simpler than originally an abstract.

469
00:58:16,104 --> 00:58:22,824
And now you see that this is also a function of the residual data is I ordered another order

470
00:58:23,094 --> 00:58:27,654
for the smallest or the largest actually it doesn't all the zero and all the ones on order.

471
00:58:28,434 --> 00:58:35,514
And now obviously this is still a function. The original data for the written data that gets this number only gets one of them.

472
00:58:35,874 --> 00:58:44,694
This is a function that is not a lot simpler than the original estimate by definition, but it is still a data sum.

473
00:58:45,624 --> 00:58:49,164
So the reason a statistic is in order statistic.

474
00:58:51,324 --> 00:58:54,454
And I left many of them alone.

475
00:58:56,944 --> 00:59:02,164
So. So now we try to understand the data adoption.

476
00:59:05,814 --> 00:59:10,044
Using this as a partition of the social space.

477
00:59:10,734 --> 00:59:21,894
So let's see how we can do that. So the data reduction can be viewed as the partition of the sample space deployment advisor statistics.

478
00:59:22,244 --> 00:59:28,164
So, you know, what is the sample space? One of the samples based, do you remember this?

479
00:59:30,054 --> 00:59:33,834
So let's look at this. So it's a small amount of data.

480
00:59:34,194 --> 00:59:39,474
So now some of that is a three. So I have three data point X1 X two and x three.

481
00:59:39,804 --> 00:59:45,474
And they are following a distribution being closer to me. Now the sole and the final statistic.

482
00:59:45,984 --> 00:59:52,524
So we already said is that a proportion or summation would be intuitively would be a good summary.

483
00:59:52,744 --> 00:59:55,904
So these days, a statistic based a statistic.

484
00:59:56,844 --> 01:00:08,124
And again, this statistic is reduce a dimension from all three for all of us because a reason I have three data point is is are is a live on you

485
01:00:08,124 --> 01:00:16,824
call it as base of dimension three and not have a single numbers and now then new then you find live in space with dimension one.

486
01:00:17,424 --> 01:00:23,064
And so these are my concept. Your money, your confidence.

487
01:00:23,424 --> 01:00:30,444
So what? So what is the domain and the range of the function here and the whole sample space partition of five.

488
01:00:30,954 --> 01:00:34,824
So we're going to answer this question. So what do I mean by sample space?

489
01:00:35,184 --> 01:00:41,864
The sample space in the space contains all possible realization of your run.

490
01:00:41,874 --> 01:00:47,694
The very fact. So. So I have rerun the variables x to x minus two and x three.

491
01:00:47,964 --> 01:00:55,944
So each one then can take value zero or. So this means it could be 000001010.

492
01:00:56,094 --> 01:01:02,514
So if you list all the possibility, how many elements is there on the back?

493
01:01:02,664 --> 01:01:05,714
Because this the first number I can take about the zero one.

494
01:01:05,724 --> 01:01:09,274
The second number can take a zero over a certain amount can take eight zero.

495
01:01:09,834 --> 01:01:13,974
So that eight possibilities. So this is my sample space.

496
01:01:14,484 --> 01:01:25,284
So this is my sample space. So, so here I'm just reviewing some terminology and I use this group letter to denote some whole space.

497
01:01:25,614 --> 01:01:39,164
So this is my sample. Take my sample space. It contains eight element and all I defined in this function p t in a summation of x1x2 by 2x3.

498
01:01:40,074 --> 01:01:47,424
What possible value can he take? He can be zero and B1 can be two.

499
01:01:47,814 --> 01:01:55,974
Can be three. I see that in a new space. In a new space is contained for possibility.

500
01:01:56,274 --> 01:02:08,754
So these are four element in a new space. So now I see that in the original sample space, not eight element in a new space, there are four elements.

501
01:02:09,294 --> 01:02:13,283
And you see that even the original element is 000 is the VAB.

502
01:02:13,284 --> 01:02:25,284
The new new element is zero, a two for all the three for all this we are going to hear the original data for the 001010100.

503
01:02:25,674 --> 01:02:29,454
That's the summation. That would all be the same. That would be like that.

504
01:02:29,604 --> 01:02:36,924
So this means that by defining this statistic, I actually grouped the three and it into a single map.

505
01:02:37,434 --> 01:02:45,324
So the eight elements actually are partitioned into four groups that move together.

506
01:02:45,584 --> 01:02:49,864
Three. And when they come together, all the three. I'm a here. The groups get together.

507
01:02:49,914 --> 01:02:56,064
I didn't know this as eight. So. So this is what I mean by partition of the sample space.

508
01:02:56,484 --> 01:03:02,753
So here. So what are the domain and a range? So domain here is just a region of sample space.

509
01:03:02,754 --> 01:03:09,324
Right. So this is a domain of the function T and this is the range of the function.

510
01:03:09,324 --> 01:03:17,514
T The range you can take value 013 and how is the sample space partition of it?

511
01:03:17,904 --> 01:03:22,974
So in the in the beginning, the sample space contains eight element.

512
01:03:23,364 --> 01:03:30,234
And now I grew that element together into a class and now is partition into four groups.

513
01:03:30,624 --> 01:03:37,434
And the form groups actually respond to the full element in the new space.

514
01:03:38,064 --> 01:03:45,923
So I have a name for. So this is what we call the sample spaces and I call this new space in the image space.

515
01:03:45,924 --> 01:03:48,414
I use the smooth key to denote this,

516
01:03:49,374 --> 01:04:01,884
but this is group T and it is group p a this a script t can take a value lowercase p and the locus t is x cosine of x in the original form of this.

517
01:04:02,514 --> 01:04:05,694
So yeah. So this. This is a little bit abstract.

518
01:04:06,204 --> 01:04:09,744
Trying to see if you can use your mask instead of the statement.

519
01:04:10,274 --> 01:04:18,864
This statement means that the key he is a sad face and in this phase it can take about, you know, his teeth and what number that he is,

520
01:04:19,044 --> 01:04:28,344
that he can be any number as long as it did so for some of the X in the space, then it's lowercase t regrows he of he next.

521
01:04:29,774 --> 01:04:40,524
So we don't know that he had b0000 the longer he is, you know, if the the character in all of his eggs is 001 and he that you can go back.

522
01:04:40,524 --> 01:04:48,864
So if you include all the possibilities it's 0123 and a soft he is.

523
01:04:53,554 --> 01:04:57,904
Is this a space? Is is a partition.

524
01:04:57,904 --> 01:05:02,094
So we call it partition. So. So this is a sub one.

525
01:05:02,464 --> 01:05:06,124
This is a sub two. So this is a sub two.

526
01:05:10,044 --> 01:05:13,124
They say the one space is the most basic.

527
01:05:13,394 --> 01:05:22,004
So the original sample space contained egg elements and now a partition as a tool for full classes.

528
01:05:22,524 --> 01:05:27,674
And I have a name for this. So the first class I call this A0 second called A1.

529
01:05:28,034 --> 01:05:34,424
The the substance here you just the number t so that is an image of this function.

530
01:05:34,844 --> 01:05:38,624
So, so it was I define this function, the summation.

531
01:05:38,774 --> 01:05:41,824
So you set a record in or using the data. So we do data.

532
01:05:41,834 --> 01:05:47,164
So now I really tell you my example here me is going to be be a 10,000.

533
01:05:47,634 --> 01:05:49,304
So could be a very large number.

534
01:05:49,514 --> 01:05:57,584
So instead of reporting all the data, then once you do advance, you will find you find a summary, you can only import a single number.

535
01:05:58,124 --> 01:06:01,484
And so by measuring this single number, basically,

536
01:06:02,264 --> 01:06:12,464
it doesn't mean that I don't need to know whether it's 00.0104100 only to know that nothing is a single back in my origin.

537
01:06:13,064 --> 01:06:21,554
So, so basically once you record this increment, you know, that you can imagine is lying on the glass.

538
01:06:21,884 --> 01:06:27,884
You know, that's not the exact element you need to know if you are somewhere in the good.

539
01:06:29,924 --> 01:06:32,714
So actually in this case, in this particular example,

540
01:06:32,894 --> 01:06:46,214
so the so the proportion and the summation now go somewhere in a sense that they are similar also that actually do not lose information.

541
01:06:46,464 --> 01:06:48,164
If you are going to hold your file,

542
01:06:48,164 --> 01:06:54,463
what do you mean by do not know the information but the minimum order statistic and then the order statistic on the minimal.

543
01:06:54,464 --> 01:06:55,904
That's the level of the information.

544
01:06:56,204 --> 01:07:03,374
So the order statistic actually also includes the opposite in a sense that if you do not the information that is not that simple.

545
01:07:04,184 --> 01:07:12,524
So so now we will do that in a big hug about what we mean.

546
01:07:12,884 --> 01:07:14,384
I'm not moving information.

547
01:07:14,864 --> 01:07:27,254
So yeah, so this the data reduction and the partitioning of the sample space is just they are truly creating a base tool to define a statistic.

548
01:07:27,584 --> 01:07:33,734
It just to give you an intuitive idea of what we mean by partitions by a data reduction.

549
01:07:33,914 --> 01:07:41,743
So the partition of a sample space that is not statistic was defined as statistic plans you define that function so so actually

550
01:07:41,744 --> 01:07:48,614
you do you find a partitioning of the sample space and the partition or a sample space in course or using a small space?

551
01:07:48,914 --> 01:07:56,174
What do I mean by causal the cause? That means that, for example, additionally, you know exactly what in the observe data,

552
01:07:56,414 --> 01:08:05,593
you know whether it is element one or element who atom as do it right you know the exact data elements that in the data and now if I only report

553
01:08:05,594 --> 01:08:18,584
a summary you do not you may not know exactly what the data is and you only know that each belong to which we subset zero or A1 a tool is three.

554
01:08:18,764 --> 01:08:26,594
So now so they are putting it into a full subset and you only know that you are data lies in which subset.

555
01:08:26,894 --> 01:08:35,953
So so the now that you use base it calls it the original sample space and we call it of course up so is also currently just means the

556
01:08:35,954 --> 01:08:46,814
cube act is simpler than the original X and therefore the data reduction can be achieved by these functions and these statistics.

557
01:08:49,104 --> 01:08:52,404
So if you have a very good one standing up, what is a function?

558
01:08:53,004 --> 01:09:00,264
So this way of seeing things is on intuitive of you using a this is a to abstract and a you do not.

559
01:09:01,284 --> 01:09:05,244
So if you think this is true, that is totally okay.

560
01:09:05,394 --> 01:09:14,124
I think the point is how do we define something we define in summary, by defining a function of run the variable.

561
01:09:14,544 --> 01:09:25,674
And this function is called a statistic and this statistic it will partition of some of space and a new, some would say space because that is.

562
01:09:29,674 --> 01:09:32,824
Well, that is not what we know so far.

563
01:09:34,624 --> 01:09:47,224
So now, as I said, making the research data simpler and the one goal I love it could be that your data summary is very simple but is not very useful.

564
01:09:47,914 --> 01:09:55,714
For example, if I tell you that the minimum order statistic and zero, it is useful for you.

565
01:09:58,084 --> 01:10:07,984
So if I tell you that 20% of the n i finest percent of the sample have them black,

566
01:10:08,524 --> 01:10:18,304
this is a useful thing because from here you may guess that the key, the target of whom you want is a small number because only 5% of them go back.

567
01:10:18,694 --> 01:10:24,034
And remember, if I tell you the meaning of all the statistic is you have no idea.

568
01:10:24,034 --> 01:10:32,224
Or even if you have a big number, a small number, and you do not know.

569
01:10:32,854 --> 01:10:39,154
So. So until we know that the minimum order statistic was not, it is as simple as the averages,

570
01:10:39,424 --> 01:10:43,324
as simple as a summation and is no information about people.

571
01:10:43,664 --> 01:10:51,344
So so now the goal we to a second goal if you want to achieve is you want the

572
01:10:51,424 --> 01:10:56,434
sum summary here information about the not in the content in the origin of X.

573
01:10:59,064 --> 01:11:02,134
And that is the concept of sufficiency.

574
01:11:02,944 --> 01:11:11,224
So the world statistics statistic is by definition very simple and in function of the recent data is a statistic.

575
01:11:11,614 --> 01:11:17,494
A sample statistic is useful as long as it is not useful or useful statistic.

576
01:11:18,004 --> 01:11:26,434
So we call this the fusion, as the fusion of statistics will keep all the information about that that is contained in the original data.

577
01:11:27,004 --> 01:11:35,134
So how can we achieve the goal? Excuse me.

578
01:11:39,604 --> 01:11:42,724
So now give amaze me. Can you can say this?

579
01:11:43,414 --> 01:11:54,814
So our goal is all to define a certain schedule p spots that is contained all information our policy that in the sample.

580
01:11:55,264 --> 01:11:58,474
So the are the world this means that.

581
01:11:59,404 --> 01:12:07,564
So what I mean by is can handle all the information. It means that once you have the summary, you don't need to take a look at the data.

582
01:12:08,254 --> 01:12:14,344
The original data cannot provide sufficient information about all the information that is already contained in the summary.

583
01:12:14,554 --> 01:12:17,224
So basically this is what it means.

584
01:12:17,614 --> 01:12:27,904
So he even that he impacts if I give you the summary knowing the full x did not give you a full information about even if you can achieve this,

585
01:12:28,234 --> 01:12:33,094
then I know that I didn't do the information, that all the information is already in the summary.

586
01:12:33,844 --> 01:12:39,514
So if such a condition is met, then he acts in so fusion of statistics.

587
01:12:41,004 --> 01:12:51,994
Because PMA contains sufficient information to make a statement about so service and what it means to you.

588
01:12:52,524 --> 01:12:54,864
And how can we define such a concept of society?

589
01:12:55,674 --> 01:13:07,824
How we need to translate the intuition into maths so how we can formalize is using a mathematical notation.

590
01:13:08,674 --> 01:13:17,904
So. So basically it means that you assess sufficient statistical statistics of X in a

591
01:13:17,904 --> 01:13:22,914
sufficient statistic or figures is the conventional distribution of the sample x,

592
01:13:23,364 --> 01:13:26,904
even the value of TMZ and our dependency.

593
01:13:27,774 --> 01:13:32,184
So how do we understand this? Why is this definition college here?

594
01:13:33,114 --> 01:13:43,944
And that's look at this closely. So conditional distribution of T of X, even the original sample.

595
01:13:45,114 --> 01:13:56,484
So as I said in the beginning, if your X is are on the variable XY, the vector vector and in function of a run, the vector is still a random variable.

596
01:13:56,934 --> 01:14:04,254
So this means t0 x is a random variable. So P of x at this is a random variable.

597
01:14:07,704 --> 01:14:11,324
It could be a random that let's say run the variable.

598
01:14:11,334 --> 01:14:16,274
I meant that it's a random. So it could be one dimensional or perpetual.

599
01:14:16,644 --> 01:14:21,054
If you peel back to a B, it may not be a single number.

600
01:14:21,594 --> 01:14:25,434
So another is a random variable that is has a distribution.

601
01:14:25,614 --> 01:14:28,914
So it has a pdf or PMF. So. So.

602
01:14:29,574 --> 01:14:32,844
So you can write down the T in the conditional distribution.

603
01:14:33,054 --> 01:14:33,294
Right.

604
01:14:33,594 --> 01:14:54,854
So if you have a distribution, could he would he so that he has a distribution and so so is it now you have X and he and also in terms of you know,

605
01:14:54,924 --> 01:14:57,994
you have six of our you know, that you can also have the.

606
01:14:58,464 --> 01:15:02,424
And these are these we don't ask given the condition of this region.

607
01:15:02,544 --> 01:15:06,564
So the definition said is the conditional distribution of the sample.

608
01:15:06,954 --> 01:15:10,704
Even the value of the T now depend on CNN.

609
01:15:11,124 --> 01:15:16,524
And then it is a sufficient statistic. So now let me ask you the same question.

610
01:15:17,484 --> 01:15:28,334
Is the distribution of X dependent in the ACT, dependent on how so many things do?

611
01:15:28,944 --> 01:15:39,174
So distribution of this exclusion of X is a dependency on our not.

612
01:15:41,784 --> 01:15:45,084
Yes. Yes or no? Yes.

613
01:15:45,414 --> 01:15:54,114
That is my motto, because as I said in the beginning, the go back, that is my model.

614
01:15:54,564 --> 01:15:59,124
So as I said in the beginning, that's a distribution.

615
01:16:02,214 --> 01:16:06,024
So here so I said in the beginning that the distribution of the.

616
01:16:08,744 --> 01:16:11,204
So this isn't a joint dispute, how many original they had.

617
01:16:11,654 --> 01:16:19,584
So this means that the dispute over the root of the dependency that has the dependency that that is what I'm trying to look at.

618
01:16:19,604 --> 01:16:20,594
So I'm assuming.

619
01:16:20,774 --> 01:16:28,364
So, for example, if I assume we had a normal distribution, now you have the Excel anomalies which have be the mean new on the signal is good.

620
01:16:29,054 --> 01:16:37,394
So I'm using my I can see the data dependency and if the user data I can't I have no information about that.

621
01:16:37,394 --> 01:16:42,854
Right. So the reason is so this is a yes. So now we have this mutant dependency.

622
01:16:43,394 --> 01:16:46,814
So what in that individual. So in that if you know t dependency for not.

623
01:16:51,504 --> 01:16:57,024
It's now the distribution of teeth and the dependency on the.

624
01:16:59,584 --> 01:17:06,994
May or may not. So if I define t of x, equal to zero is the constant because we didn't know that dependency it.

625
01:17:07,624 --> 01:17:12,753
But usually in general the distribution may depend on seeing it because your x dependency

626
01:17:12,754 --> 01:17:18,544
that now a function of x in general is to be a dependency that is mean that in general,

627
01:17:18,724 --> 01:17:24,694
as long as is not true the statistic that he will give you information policy.

628
01:17:25,354 --> 01:17:31,434
So actually once you have the distribution dependency as it means the data can give you information about.

629
01:17:32,314 --> 01:17:38,104
So for example, the plural distribution, you have to have a assume as coin of at the root of distribution.

630
01:17:38,644 --> 01:17:46,294
The coin toss can give you information about the probability of that because it is being a dependency now.

631
01:17:47,404 --> 01:17:54,754
So not so here. So what we are interested in is the distribution of X, even T.

632
01:17:59,144 --> 01:18:05,134
Usually when you're a pilot nominee and 611 actor, you can derive this distribution, right?

633
01:18:05,324 --> 01:18:08,574
Because find that if you to. You're not going to be huge on key.

634
01:18:08,744 --> 01:18:13,334
And again, if you want distribution, you can get a commission distribution and why it would go away.

635
01:18:13,494 --> 01:18:16,574
You'll see that normally the distribution all depends on them.

636
01:18:17,864 --> 01:18:22,994
However, in a special case, that is the diffusion that now dependency that gives them that are dependent.

637
01:18:23,564 --> 01:18:28,543
I think that this means if I give you nothing, see you, you know, you'll meet up.

638
01:18:28,544 --> 01:18:36,584
I'll see that that. So. So if I suppose I tell you and you have x equal to a hundred,

639
01:18:37,424 --> 01:18:42,434
then this country can provide you no information about the kind of distribution that our dependency.

640
01:18:43,004 --> 01:18:54,974
So this this definition says once you know the value of T, then now X, then the next description, the condition is we have a dependency.

641
01:18:54,974 --> 01:19:02,174
That doesn't mean knowing the net and not providing information to help understand this definition.

642
01:19:02,654 --> 01:19:06,644
So you need to know that if the distribution you can see them.

643
01:19:07,394 --> 01:19:11,124
If the distribution of you are on a variable, you can all see that.

644
01:19:11,684 --> 01:19:21,854
Then see in the distribution, see the data come provide information about CNN and if the data diffusion that they had done now dependency them,

645
01:19:22,334 --> 01:19:27,824
then see that they can give you no information about the parameters you.

646
01:19:28,604 --> 01:19:35,804
So these definitions said once you know the value of the statistic, if you know the key of x equal to the small T,

647
01:19:36,284 --> 01:19:45,554
then the original date of the condition distribution, the original, the condition distribution of the written data and now dependency,

648
01:19:45,764 --> 01:19:56,734
which means that data and not providing you a fusion that information and so so these data well here says now

649
01:19:56,744 --> 01:20:03,514
read the data come providing information passing up the 70 seconds data means that so even if you don't see this,

650
01:20:03,524 --> 01:20:13,544
I don't see that this means that some music is providing information of these data and said that knowing the value of the summer statistic,

651
01:20:13,754 --> 01:20:17,154
the origin effects provide, you know, usually information.

652
01:20:19,844 --> 01:20:29,444
And actually so then the distribution here depend on see how not depends on whether t the summit city was truly a sovereign and the

653
01:20:29,454 --> 01:20:37,664
constant that these are not providing information but see that this is actually a summary and not useful and actually a good summary.

654
01:20:37,934 --> 01:20:43,264
A good statistic. Who handles these? Because your summer statistics must keep the major losses.

655
01:20:43,664 --> 01:20:47,173
So you face actually that you are a sufficient statistic.

656
01:20:47,174 --> 01:20:50,774
This decision must depend. We'll see them and they have you to talk about.

657
01:20:50,774 --> 01:20:53,264
This is actually easier for you to see.

658
01:20:55,004 --> 01:21:07,844
Any question here can you relate the most the definition of a sufficient statistic to let intuition make sure you understand things?

659
01:21:13,994 --> 01:21:30,784
Okay, let's move on. So now let's use we already look at this example and intuitively I think you all would agree that a summation is a good summary.

660
01:21:31,414 --> 01:21:38,664
It's providing information about the out that, you know, how many of the earnings will give you a vibe.

661
01:21:38,764 --> 01:21:42,874
Now you find this information, you can make a good guess about that.

662
01:21:42,964 --> 01:21:48,064
You have all the information about the now that's forming a check, whether it's a sufficient statistics or not.

663
01:21:48,934 --> 01:21:58,004
So I have data x12x, the I.D. baloney distribution piece, and I want to show that the summation is sufficient.

664
01:21:59,114 --> 01:22:02,824
So this means that. My final assignment.

665
01:22:04,214 --> 01:22:10,504
I can discard all the original data and only want to keep a summary and I will not lose the information about a piece.

666
01:22:10,804 --> 01:22:16,294
And based on the experience that in the case that you do not want to keep all the data, whether Zito's out.

667
01:22:16,834 --> 01:22:23,314
He doesn't need to know auto. That only comes about how many of them is over, how many of that is a zero plus.

668
01:22:23,704 --> 01:22:27,374
So and also on the SSL,

669
01:22:27,684 --> 01:22:35,664
so these see that the original data that these three tracks depend on keep the record that the original X had opportunity three times the keys.

670
01:22:35,974 --> 01:22:43,674
Now this new statistic that these will tell you statistically is a binomial distribution in the prominent analogy and I see that p

671
01:22:43,774 --> 01:22:55,474
depend on the key depend on the R for the T providing you information about P and now the reason how often knowing the value of the P,

672
01:22:55,894 --> 01:22:59,764
that is the reason data providing for the information of our P.

673
01:23:00,124 --> 01:23:06,064
If you can't use it, it can provide you for the information about P and it mean that he is not sufficient

674
01:23:06,244 --> 01:23:09,244
that he knew the information on the x can give you all this information.

675
01:23:09,844 --> 01:23:16,774
If he had no knowledge to provide additional information, then this just means a t is already sufficient.

676
01:23:18,664 --> 01:23:22,144
So let's look at this. I mean, are you the definition to check this?

677
01:23:22,774 --> 01:23:28,214
Oh, what we need to do is we want to the are the definitions.

678
01:23:28,774 --> 01:23:35,644
So we actually need to calculate the distribution of X, even T, right.

679
01:23:35,884 --> 01:23:46,654
So you do know he isn't working. So we video we need to evaluate a conditional distribution and a your Emmanuel conditional distribution.

680
01:23:46,894 --> 01:23:53,074
I need to know the laws of distribution. So for a six of our, you know, so forth, best guess, no distribution.

681
01:23:53,074 --> 01:24:05,643
Okay. And as I said before, because X has distribution ready now for the summation of Pallone is a binomial distribution.

682
01:24:05,644 --> 01:24:12,424
Right. You see that here. The distribution of T depend on p and remember the question to ask here.

683
01:24:12,694 --> 01:24:22,654
The Bangladeshi without how to p dependency have. So here we see that this statistic actually distributed dependance and now we need to

684
01:24:22,654 --> 01:24:28,654
find in the conditional distribution of x given all the new condition distribution.

685
01:24:30,904 --> 01:24:35,374
You need to apply the knowledge in the conditional distribution.

686
01:24:36,094 --> 01:24:41,514
So here. So we know that we need to evaluate this condition distribution.

687
01:24:41,694 --> 01:24:44,874
Now here I use both the latter to denote run the vector.

688
01:24:45,124 --> 01:24:48,124
So now I write, I use x bar and exit.

689
01:24:48,144 --> 01:24:55,214
So these are exactly the same different locations because the okay folder means X manual access.

690
01:24:55,954 --> 01:25:10,494
So even make equality. Now if I want to evaluate conditional distribution and this is not issue probability, the equal tool, the joint path is here.

691
01:25:10,764 --> 01:25:20,044
So the probability of a given be equal to the probability and be divided by the probability of fact.

692
01:25:21,444 --> 01:25:25,144
So. Okay.

693
01:25:25,154 --> 01:25:32,324
Here. So I said that let's call this event a event a means.

694
01:25:32,324 --> 01:25:39,044
It sets the bar code to test one x and you control x.

695
01:25:39,094 --> 01:25:54,944
And I call this event a call that you might be in the summation of X, Y, Y, from one to an equal to two event.

696
01:25:55,034 --> 01:26:02,654
Right. So here this is the probability of a even speech.

697
01:26:02,864 --> 01:26:19,124
But so in six so bar you learn the conditional property is the probability of B from the busy of a, a and B divided by the probability that.

698
01:26:19,304 --> 01:26:27,224
So you see that. So this is the probability of being as follows in a summation exact equity in the numerator.

699
01:26:27,464 --> 01:26:33,344
So this is the probability of a and the probability of now.

700
01:26:35,994 --> 01:26:42,504
How do you this probability now to see that it's.

701
01:26:44,074 --> 01:26:51,524
So I'm supposed. So.

702
01:26:51,684 --> 01:26:57,534
So here I'm saying if the opportunity is the summation of lowercase x equals zero.

703
01:26:59,514 --> 01:27:06,154
So let's say so.

704
01:27:09,864 --> 01:27:19,494
So this is the event incompatible mean event B so what I mean by that is so suppose I say so if I'm out of the loop.

705
01:27:19,494 --> 01:27:24,554
They say that causes x y on lines.

706
01:27:32,814 --> 01:27:45,384
So if t is zero even lower than T in zero and my ex the bottom is a while the ex x is about.

707
01:27:45,864 --> 01:27:49,524
So this. So this is. So it is possible event or not?

708
01:27:51,324 --> 01:27:59,394
It is possible. So here I am saying that x y is equal contrast as to any one about an x equals maintaining x equal to zero.

709
01:27:59,424 --> 01:28:02,664
It is possible that is not possibly that. But.

710
01:28:02,814 --> 01:28:08,114
So the. And b they cannot happen simultaneous. So in that case, this probably is zero, right?

711
01:28:08,994 --> 01:28:17,034
So if this is the case. So this actually in the probability is zero because and I they cannot happen simultaneous.

712
01:28:17,964 --> 01:28:25,904
So this means the problem in only non-zero when the formation of a within the X is equal to this T that you can possibly.

713
01:28:26,274 --> 01:28:29,484
So only in this case the problem is not zero.

714
01:28:30,084 --> 01:28:35,783
You see what I'm trying to say? Never to isolate natural cases like is that they had to be.

715
01:28:35,784 --> 01:28:40,354
They cannot happen 17 is why is that they had to be that they come back.

716
01:28:40,734 --> 01:28:45,054
So if they are easy to happen, this doesn't mean that the summation lowercase x equals.

717
01:28:45,814 --> 01:28:48,914
Now I see this is still the denominator.

718
01:28:48,924 --> 01:28:53,984
I didn't see anything wrong with it. Well, for the numerator, if you cancel already, it has a problem.

719
01:28:54,174 --> 01:29:02,544
And now this thing. Just the probability of x y that my that.

720
01:29:05,104 --> 01:29:10,864
So this is to me. So this is the case because of the color.

721
01:29:11,434 --> 01:29:19,264
So. So you see that? So this. So suppose I was making that and you go two me.

722
01:29:19,354 --> 01:29:24,364
So let's say A is zero.

723
01:29:24,754 --> 01:29:27,964
Your back. Let's say.

724
01:29:33,494 --> 01:29:46,604
So a so a just means now this is x7x2 and x three and a b is the summation of x even.

725
01:29:48,164 --> 01:30:00,764
Now the and B they are compatible. Correct. So and we mean that some type of 717 and how the element and the B can be 001010100.

726
01:30:01,124 --> 01:30:13,244
So the actually contains three elements. Give me the B and ten 001010 and one zero.

727
01:30:13,924 --> 01:30:18,434
You see that B is a big event and they are compatible.

728
01:30:18,764 --> 01:30:23,204
So actually so in this case, say.

729
01:30:24,734 --> 01:30:31,004
There's a subset of, if you agree, a subset of that.

730
01:30:31,034 --> 01:30:36,404
So therefore the probability of A and B is just equal to the probability.

731
01:30:37,484 --> 01:30:43,454
Do you see that the natural possibility, the first possibility in A and B, they're not compatible.

732
01:30:43,634 --> 01:30:47,624
So this is an event.

733
01:30:48,494 --> 01:30:53,804
So this is the event. Even if a is if any event means.

734
01:30:54,884 --> 01:31:02,054
So it makes X equal to a zero. And then this is not compatible with these this, these.

735
01:31:02,744 --> 01:31:09,164
So this is a B. So in this case, that is, if you give you zero because A and B, they're not compatible.

736
01:31:09,764 --> 01:31:17,834
Another situation is A and B, they are compatible. So this made the summation of the X, Y and Z that you could fool your key.

737
01:31:18,644 --> 01:31:27,194
But in this case, like in a subset of B and therefore the probability of and to be just equal, probably today is equal.

738
01:31:29,664 --> 01:31:34,764
So it's actually not difficult, but a little bit confusing.

739
01:31:35,124 --> 01:31:39,864
Just make sure you understand the conditional statement, the probability statement.

740
01:31:40,524 --> 01:31:51,684
So now I just I need to evaluate this. So the probability of X, Y and equal to X, Y, and Z because of the X, I have no idea.

741
01:31:52,044 --> 01:31:56,034
So this problem is equal to the product of this problem.

742
01:31:56,574 --> 01:32:00,084
So this is by independence.

743
01:32:03,724 --> 01:32:06,854
And then I applied the balloon distribution.

744
01:32:07,394 --> 01:32:18,314
So this is from the glory distribution. For the future enterprises provided they have simplified this.

745
01:32:18,944 --> 01:32:27,164
And then and because of this amazing summation of the lowercase x equals T.

746
01:32:27,674 --> 01:32:32,503
But why is that? Because I only consider this situation that so I only need to type in the

747
01:32:32,504 --> 01:32:37,214
probability and this I'm going to XIV catalog has t so this that you can use this.

748
01:32:38,204 --> 01:32:47,024
So now I have so I can create this numerator and then I also need a common denominator, the denominator.

749
01:32:47,054 --> 01:32:53,624
So this is a binomial distribution. So this is a binomial distribution.

750
01:32:55,424 --> 01:33:02,774
This is about the PMF over by normal distribution. Now I'm happy with this ratio.

751
01:33:03,374 --> 01:33:06,464
So yes, so this is the ratio of interest.

752
01:33:07,814 --> 01:33:15,764
And now if I combine all of them together so I know that the conditional distribution actually is this.

753
01:33:16,604 --> 01:33:28,064
So if the summation log is X equal to the T, even for this number, then this event is possible and this probability in bottom long this number.

754
01:33:28,784 --> 01:33:38,024
And is this is this so even the sum of an excited about equal t so this is impossible event then the conditional probably

755
01:33:38,354 --> 01:33:49,484
includes you two situations and we need to do is we need to look at the data with all of this to see that there is no P here.

756
01:33:49,754 --> 01:33:56,864
Now you see that this is probably in an equal zero or even to a constant now now depend on p and this

757
01:33:56,864 --> 01:34:05,324
mean the conditional probability and now depend on P now for our definition of a sufficient statistic.

758
01:34:05,744 --> 01:34:08,834
So this summation is a sufficient statistical function.

759
01:34:10,094 --> 01:34:13,964
So this match in our intuition models.

760
01:34:13,964 --> 01:34:22,844
You already know the San Mateo X, so you mean once you know the total numbers of heads,

761
01:34:23,684 --> 01:34:29,204
we don't even know exactly which coin cos give you a head of each coin toss.

762
01:34:29,204 --> 01:34:41,084
Give you a tip. Yes. And these were the total number of and in the summation is a sufficient an expression here.

763
01:34:44,444 --> 01:34:51,734
I think it's going to be will these this pull yourself up to the class.

764
01:34:53,654 --> 01:34:57,644
So so let's summarize the result from this group.

765
01:34:58,124 --> 01:35:02,774
So this problem just says if the X so x is a realization.

766
01:35:02,984 --> 01:35:06,704
So this is a realization. This is x one through x.

767
01:35:07,064 --> 01:35:16,244
So if the realization is a sample point such that the summation out of here cannot be complete, then this problem is here.

768
01:35:16,484 --> 01:35:23,624
And here, probably in zero 12 is the impossible event that this the zero over the whole that's not a part of this.

769
01:35:24,074 --> 01:35:31,813
So actually if this is equal to zero in our dependency, then we don't need to consider this situation any more.

770
01:35:31,814 --> 01:35:37,094
Correct. So we don't have to consider in this case and TMX does not equal T in the future.

771
01:35:37,664 --> 01:35:44,444
And these are simplified a little bit and this is less than zero for showing insufficiency.

772
01:35:45,014 --> 01:35:57,904
So this is in the 062. So this zero says if you had the joint distribution for X, so this is all about that.

773
01:35:59,864 --> 01:36:06,734
As we define the statistic, then you have the distribution of T, so this is also around the variable.

774
01:36:06,974 --> 01:36:12,824
So everybody knows that these were 40 as Q you can use f t that is not true.

775
01:36:12,884 --> 01:36:19,814
You are not even know that you have a distribution here in a sufficient statistic for 15 years.

776
01:36:20,384 --> 01:36:28,394
These ratio is constant as a function. See that this means this rate and our dependency in this ratio.

777
01:36:28,394 --> 01:36:31,534
For me, unexpectedly, this is enough for me.

778
01:36:33,224 --> 01:36:36,584
But in this patient you look, I approve this way.

779
01:36:36,584 --> 01:36:49,094
So it just looks like this message out in the numerator it is the distribution in the sample, the denominator distribution for the T.

780
01:36:50,054 --> 01:36:56,954
So I see that. So here it says actually you don't need to consider the impossible case, impossible scenario.

781
01:36:57,194 --> 01:37:02,144
You only need to look at the ratio of all of the jobs to each of your X and in the mass and distribution.

782
01:37:03,464 --> 01:37:07,484
And compare this Theorem 12 rules, you see that the other thing.

783
01:37:08,114 --> 01:37:13,394
So yeah, I think I'm going to end here so later, you actually do need to consider that.

784
01:37:13,534 --> 01:37:21,744
Impossible exactly to look at the fact that these guys are so young and end up out here in this.
