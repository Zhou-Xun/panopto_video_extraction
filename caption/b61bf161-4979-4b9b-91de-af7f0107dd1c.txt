Welcome to Epit six 34 is module on the history of mathematical epidemiology, Part A. In this module,

2
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:19,300
I will provide an overview of the history of mathematical epidemiology, focusing on the transmission on transmission modeling of infectious disease.

3
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:26,870
This is a two part module. There are learning objectives of these modules are one to describe the key people that contributed

4
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:32,320
to the development of mathematical epidemiology from the mid eighteen hundreds to the present.

5
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,720
And two, to formulate the conceptual underpinnings of infectious disease transmission models.

6
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:42,430
This summary will provide you with the foundation for understanding the models that we will be.

7
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:50,590
We will learn in this course we start the history of mathematical epidemiology in the mid 19th century,

8
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:54,760
at which time there are two prevailing theories of disease causation.

9
00:00:54,760 --> 00:01:01,750
My asthma, which was the theory that disease was caused by putrid air and decaying organic matter and contagion,

10
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:06,970
which was the theory that disease was caused by the ingestion of disease agents.

11
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:11,020
William Farr was a strong proponent of my asthma theory.

12
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:18,600
He was a statistician who tallied mortality data and fit normal curves to epidemics at the same time.

13
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:24,100
Jon Snow embraced contagion theory, which largely came from his work as a pathologist.

14
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:30,220
When conducting autopsies for those who died of cholera, he observed that the pathology was in the gut.

15
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:36,960
From that, he surmised that the disease came from ingestion of some type of agent.

16
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,820
By the early 20th century, the contagion theory morphed into the germ theory,

17
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:50,930
which became the prevailing theory of disease causation and the major theoretical driver behind transmission modeling.

18
00:01:50,930 --> 00:02:00,040
And this leads to the mass action theory of transmission. The premise of the theory of mass action is that the number of new cases,

19
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:05,270
the number of new cases is proportional to the product of the current number of cases.

20
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:16,640
And the current number susceptible is within a given venue. William Hamre was the first to codify this theory into the following equation.

21
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:26,190
The number of cases at time T plus one is equal to the number of cases at time t.

22
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:34,070
Times the number of susceptible is at time t. And time's a transmission rate parameter.

23
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:46,560
Are the premise of this model is by knowing the current number is susceptible in cases, we can use the equation to predict the future number of cases.

24
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,520
The theory is based on that, on direct transmission.

25
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:58,950
That is, when cases come into contact, Clowe come into close contact with susceptible as transmission occurs at rate.

26
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:08,790
Ah, but it was surround Ross who pushes the theory into the into a new field of science.

27
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:13,350
He distinguishes between inductive reasoning that comes from it comes about through

28
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:19,410
observation and statistical modeling of observational data and deductive reasoning

29
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:23,520
that comes about through developing mechanistic models based on our knowledge of

30
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:30,540
the disease process and is developed prior to collecting observational data.

31
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:37,050
He used mechanistic transmission modeling theory to propose a threshold effect of malaria transmission.

32
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:41,160
Prior to his theory, prior to this theory proposed by Ross,

33
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:47,940
people believed that unless you could completely eradicate mosquitoes, it wasn't worth controlling their population level.

34
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:58,290
Ross proposed that you just needed to bring the density of mosquitoes below a threshold level to drive transmission to zero and eradicate the disease.

35
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:06,180
Using mechanistic models, Ross distinguishes between distinguished between dependent happenings where risk of disease

36
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:11,070
is dependent on the number of people already with the disease and independent happening,

37
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:20,160
where happenings where the risk of disease is independent of the number of disease in the population dependent happenings.

38
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:27,330
Was it was then codified by using a mass action basis for transmission that was originally proposed by William Hamer.

39
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:40,620
As we saw in the prior a prior slide. This diagram of Ross's model of transmission is conceptually equivalent to Hamer's mass action model.

40
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:46,850
Susceptible has become infected at a rate H.

41
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:52,400
Referring to the dependent happenings. That is a rate proportional to the number of receptacles.

42
00:04:52,400 --> 00:05:02,060
Times the number of cases. In addition, he added to the model the recovery back to the susceptible state.

43
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:07,040
Again, Ross is most interested in malaria.

44
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:15,920
In the late 1920s, Mackendrick advances advances transmission theory by developing what we now call the SDR model.

45
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:22,280
He adds an explicit state that represents those that are immune or removed from the transmission process.

46
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:32,660
That is the R or recovered state. This essay, our transmission model, provided the insight that there was a threshold number as susceptible as below,

47
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:39,860
which an epidemic was not possible. This threshold effect was further developed into the concept of herd immunity.

48
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:44,870
And to this day is the basis for vaccination control strategy.

49
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:52,990
He demonstrated that epidemic size increases with increasing population density.

50
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:55,930
He was also able to debunk.

51
00:05:55,930 --> 00:06:05,560
Accepted theories at the time, for example, that the susceptible population was always exhausted during the course of an epidemic,

52
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:10,200
an organism virulence decreased during the course of an epidemic.

53
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:22,481
Kendra says our model is still the basis of most transmission models used today and the basis for the models that we will explore in this course.
