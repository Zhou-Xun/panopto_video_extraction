1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:07,470
Are you going to do anything? Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

2
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:17,820
How would you like my first year?

3
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:30,660
And I completely. But I wanted to just be like, general, you know, this is the kind of thing, you know what?

4
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:38,680
We would have sweet dinners and just hours ago.

5
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:47,580
I know people are going to start in just a couple minutes.

6
00:00:51,310 --> 00:01:05,000
I remember. And, you know, you're in this country and.

7
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:44,790
This was the perfect example I'm running to where everything is more difficult just in the it becomes the thing that's wanted more rigorous is that.

8
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:52,070
Yeah, I just. I don't want you to take it from me.

9
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:08,880
Okay. 1132. We'll go ahead and get started and I'm sure a couple more people will come in.

10
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:16,950
So today I'm going to finish up the couple of slides that we left off with on

11
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:24,570
Monday and also continue talking about how chemicals cause cellular injury.

12
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:37,870
And before I do that morning, I wanted to Maria, we were talking about the the symposium that I mentioned.

13
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:41,550
It's actually in February. That's why I couldn't find it on my or sorry. It's in March.

14
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:43,410
That's why I couldn't find it on my February calendar.

15
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:54,030
But I wanted to point out the DHS Research Symposium, which is organized by the Etap Training Grant Students for Friday, March 10th.

16
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:59,780
The tentative time it's usually 9 to 3 ish and of interest to our class.

17
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:01,730
The topic is industrial contamination.

18
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:11,520
And there are some interesting speakers here, including the retired founder and director of a super fund research program.

19
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,530
Now that he's out of government role, he promises to be unruffled.

20
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:25,139
Rothblatt, the environmental lawyer and partner with the law firm that has worked on people, specifically C8,

21
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:31,020
which is a I'll get into more detail when we talk about perhaps in a week or

22
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:37,290
two and other speakers to be determined with regard to science and policy.

23
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,980
So if you are available, you might want to check that out.

24
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:46,950
And there's one thing I also wanted to touch on.

25
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:52,620
So it looks like several of you signed up for the cases already.

26
00:03:54,450 --> 00:04:01,980
I'm a case study sign up sheet, but if any of you, those of you who haven't signed up yet, please feel free to do that.

27
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:08,819
So we have ten cases and nine or sorry. Yeah, ten cases and nine people in the class.

28
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:12,150
So if nobody signs up for the case,

29
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:22,290
I can go ahead and cover that one and then we'll just have each of you go through one for the rest of the semester, but completely up to you.

30
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:28,680
Any questions when we get started? Yeah, it's about the case studies.

31
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:34,860
I mean, is there a or like I forgot.

32
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:44,759
What about it? You want to look at exactly. Cover? Yeah, I talk about it in detail a little more, a little bit of detail in the syllabus.

33
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:53,370
And then I also have a rubric that I, I haven't published the assignment, but I'll publish it and has a rubric associated with it.

34
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:03,360
And I can also, maybe, maybe at the beginning of class next week,

35
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:10,319
just go through a couple of examples really quickly of kind of there is a there's a couple of examples on canvas,

36
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:16,140
but I can just briefly walk through it and point out kind of what what I'm looking for with that whole.

37
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,600
Yeah, I can I didn't realize they're on campus so I can look at the.

38
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:24,450
Oh yeah, I'm sure. So, yeah. So let me just make sure I show you all where that is.

39
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:40,530
If you go to modules and you scroll all the way down, there are some example case study and journal club presentations.

40
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:46,110
So for example, this is just quickly pull this up.

41
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:55,410
This is the case study on p fast in the Ohio P fast in the Ohio River Valley.

42
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:05,190
So basically they just in each of the case study presentations, you're just walking through,

43
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:11,280
first of all, what is the chemical involved and how is it how is it used?

44
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:17,430
Is it why is it toxic? Why is it cause problems in the body?

45
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:26,190
And so she, the previous student, walked through kind of what parts are in general,

46
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:35,489
what are what are the current regulations around that chemical and and then got into the meat of the the case

47
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:44,670
study in this case of DuPont and the p fast release into the waterways and the poisoning of the community.

48
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:55,170
And there was a particular farmer who was involved who really amplified this concern

49
00:06:55,410 --> 00:07:03,150
to the people and people in charge to try and get something done about this.

50
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:14,070
Contamination because it was killing his animals. And yeah, so then she just kind of walked through some of the components of that case.

51
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:20,759
Oftentimes in some of these cases, there are YouTube videos.

52
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:26,459
If you want to take a piece of a YouTube video and include that, if you think that will help, I think that's perfectly fine.

53
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:33,330
I love doing that, actually. I think there are some really good ones for the podcast in particular.

54
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:43,140
There's a very a movie that's called the have any of you seen the movie The Devil We Know So good, horrifying.

55
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:56,010
But he features this gentleman, Bucky Bailey, who was born with birth defects after his mother worked in the DuPont plant.

56
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:02,070
So, yeah, I think, you know, taking components of.

57
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:07,170
You know, what is the chemical, what's known about it? Why is it toxic?

58
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:12,430
And then just any details of the case that you should be able to find a lot of information?

59
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:20,910
I'm going to post some literature articles related to each case on canvas so that you'll have some background reading.

60
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:25,490
But for all of these case studies, there's plenty of resources available.

61
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:33,870
And if you Google the case and or if you go to PubMed and you pull a lot of these up, you'll be able to find a lot of information.

62
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,500
Yeah. So feel free to take a look at these.

63
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:48,510
And again, there's a couple examples of the the case studies and a couple of the journal clubs.

64
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:55,350
And we're not covering the Biomarin cyanide spill case study this time around,

65
00:08:55,650 --> 00:09:00,300
but you can still use it to get a feel for kind of what these things look like.

66
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:06,059
And and then some examples of the journal club and I talk about that in the syllabus.

67
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:12,120
You know, for the Journal Club, if you have a paper that you're really interested in presenting, I think I mentioned this already.

68
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:18,330
If it has, you know, ten figures don't feel like you have to present all ten figures or don't feel like

69
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:21,510
you should find another paper because you don't want to present time figures.

70
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:30,600
That's usually what happens. You can kind of, you know, take figures of particular relevance and interest and expand on those a little bit.

71
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,049
In your discussion, any other questions?

72
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:42,030
Does that clear things up a little bit? Yes, but I like two other questions with the because it sounds like as two days on the Excel sheet,

73
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,640
is it like we present one day and then Journal of the second day or do we do the two on one day?

74
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:54,540
No, it would be the case study presentation on the first day and then the journal club on the second day.

75
00:09:55,470 --> 00:10:00,920
And then do we when we're presenting with are we doing the full hour 30?

76
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:06,850
Like how long are we? Like supposed to power the time.

77
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:10,050
Like, what is it? I'm sorry. Yeah, that's good to know. Yeah, absolutely.

78
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:18,510
I think I'd put in the syllabus. It's like 40 to 45 minutes for the case study and the journal club.

79
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:23,549
Each 40 to 45 minutes. And that's not you standing up there talking the whole time.

80
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:26,160
That's just engaging each other in discussion.

81
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:34,889
So it goes by pretty quickly and I put in detail on there how for the case study presentation in the Journal Club,

82
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:43,020
you kind of you'd have your presentation in the beginning and then, you know, hopefully like 20 minutes of discussion or something like that.

83
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:50,670
After we talk about what you're after, you present the PowerPoint slides and yeah,

84
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:55,580
so for the days that we have the journal club I mentioned, we won't go.

85
00:10:55,590 --> 00:11:00,000
The whole entire class will probably get done early, which is, you know, nice,

86
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:07,920
I guess give you guys a little extra time to work on other homework for this class or other classes or whatever.

87
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:13,040
So you don't have to feel like you need to take the entire hour and a half.

88
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:18,630
This is my point. But if it does go, we've had some people that have taken an entire hour and a half.

89
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:23,579
So it's entirely up to you. Some of the case, some of the discussions do get kind of interesting.

90
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:29,180
So, um. Yeah. Any other questions driven either of you?

91
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:33,299
Yeah, sure. There's something I. Sorry to say.

92
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:38,220
I forgot. I think that's it. Okay.

93
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:49,190
So where we left off on Monday was talking about metabolism and its role in toxicant kinetics.

94
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:58,700
As I mentioned previously, lipophilic toxicants are difficult to eliminate from the body and can accumulate to hazardous levels.

95
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:06,200
But most lipophilic toxicants can be transformed into hydrophilic metabolites through the action of metabolism.

96
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:15,560
Metabolism changes the concentration a gradient across the across biological membranes, and that can impact absorption, distribution and elimination.

97
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:23,490
So metabolism. If you get into this, you'll find that it's divided into two phases.

98
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:30,330
Phase one introduces or exposes a reactive or polar group of molecules.

99
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:37,590
This includes other reactions, but the big ones are oxidation reduction and hydrolysis.

100
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:41,400
So oxidation is a loss of electrons.

101
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:48,900
Reduction is the gain of electrons, and hydrolysis is where you're breaking apart a molecule with water.

102
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:54,060
And so these are just common generic reactions that tend to occur in phase one.

103
00:12:54,420 --> 00:13:00,060
And so that's illustrated nicely over here where you have some let's say it's on

104
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:09,210
some organic chemical are and that can be through a hydrolysis hydrolysis reaction.

105
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:13,140
You're adding an age group on that and it makes it more soluble in water.

106
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,700
There are also oxidation reactions that can occur that convert.

107
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:24,030
Let's say that this is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon or patch that converts to

108
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:29,940
these reactive oxides and these are really nasty and do a lot of damage in our cells.

109
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:36,030
And this is common again with aromatic chemicals.

110
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:40,440
So chemicals that have like things like benzene and anything that has benzene rings in it.

111
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:45,990
And we'll get into this in more detail, probably in the.

112
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:50,550
I know for sure in the DNA damage lecture. And we may touch on it elsewhere as well.

113
00:13:52,350 --> 00:14:01,560
Phase two is shown over here and this is where you get conjugation of the toxicant to these charged species.

114
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:09,750
And that tends to make the chemical have a higher molecular weight and reduces its activity and facilitates its excretion.

115
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:17,040
And so South-Asian acetylation with your annotation glutathione conjugation,

116
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:25,139
these are all reactions where you have some molecule that's joined to the Z antibiotic,

117
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:38,100
the toxicant, and again increasing its molecular weight and facilitating its excretion and metabolism mainly occurs in the liver.

118
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:49,049
So cytochrome p450 those are called sips quite often, and other enzymes can modify compounds and make them more or less toxic.

119
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:58,320
So I mentioned aromatic hydrocarbons are made more toxic by cytochrome p450 metabolism

120
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:05,160
and they facilitate the removal of the antibiotic from the body to reduce exposure,

121
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:12,690
decreasing hydrophobicity as I mentioned, increasing molecular weight or size to promote elimination.

122
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:18,330
And so that was where we left off from yesterday.

123
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:26,670
Learning objectives for today are to be able to list some different mechanisms by which toxicants can enjoy ourselves,

124
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:30,750
articulate some of the ways that cells respond to injury,

125
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:37,470
and understand the connection between cellular injury and pathological effects at the oriented tissue or organism level.

126
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:46,770
This we may not get to this piece at the this is more towards the end of this lecture.

127
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:50,430
If we don't get to this today, we'll cover it throughout the semester.

128
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:54,659
We're going to revisit all of these concepts throughout the class.

129
00:15:54,660 --> 00:16:01,830
And again, these first three days are just kind of an overview of toxicology in general with some background information,

130
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:06,479
be able to form a hypothesis about how a toxicant might induce cellular injury and the

131
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:14,160
consequences that injury might have for cell health at the cellular organ tissue organism level.

132
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:23,719
So the first starter question, you don't need to write anything down unless you want to,

133
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:29,950
but can anybody think of ways that toxicants might damage ourselves?

134
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:37,700
Well, this is kind of the topic for today. So I just want to get you started brainstorming.

135
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:44,739
Yes, it's kind of broad, but it's like somehow influencing protein function.

136
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:52,270
Like if a toxin can evolve massively, like normal binding activity of something, like something, it's passed out.

137
00:16:52,420 --> 00:17:00,249
Absolutely. Yeah. So interfering with protein function and we have a section on that today where we'll talk about

138
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:09,130
some of the different protein functions and how toxicants interfere out and say like damaging DNA.

139
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:13,300
Yeah. Yeah, that's a big one. Oxidative stress.

140
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:20,830
Oxidative stress. Oxidative stress has all sorts of effects, including interfering with protein function, damaging DNA.

141
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:25,480
Yeah. All sorts of potential effects.

142
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:34,000
Damage altering the structure of the cell membrane as we'll talk about it with carbon tetrachloride as an example.

143
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:39,330
Any others? Okay.

144
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:46,170
So here's a second question. Which of the following statements is true?

145
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:53,070
And I'll just sort of reading them all to you. I'll let you just read them quickly and let me know your thoughts.

146
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:14,210
Si, si, si. Yes, that's that's right.

147
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:18,290
So hopefully cellular injury doesn't always result in cell death.

148
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:29,239
Right? We cut ourselves. We get a bruise or something. We don't get a necrotic area on our on our hand or our hip or whatever, an alpha helix.

149
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:37,100
And we'll talk about protein structure today. Toxic ation is the conversion of a parent molecule to a more reactive metabolite.

150
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:44,510
So like these reactive oxides and detoxification, as you might expect of the opposite,

151
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:49,730
chronic ethanol consumption is of course, associated with an increased risk of cancer.

152
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:54,770
And we'll get into some reasons why that is other questions.

153
00:18:57,050 --> 00:19:04,820
Okay. So in order to understand how chemicals damage cells, we need to know what functions cells have.

154
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:14,600
In general, the very basic functions for cells include things like all cells need to be able to conduct respiration,

155
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:27,139
metabolize various molecules, eliminate their waste, take out the trash, signal to one another, be able to replicate and divide this.

156
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:31,670
Doesn't many cells become terminally differentiated, meaning they're not.

157
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:41,780
They no longer undergo cell division, but replication and division is a basic function of of cells ion transport.

158
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:47,990
So even cells that are not excitable cells like neurons and cardiac monocytes,

159
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:57,649
all cells have to have some gradient of ions that are otherwise or by gradient I mean a

160
00:19:57,650 --> 00:20:03,410
difference in the concentration of a particular ion inside the cell versus outside the cell.

161
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:07,879
This is particularly important for things like calcium.

162
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:15,500
So the level of intracellular calcium is kept very, very low because it regulates the function of a lot of proteins,

163
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:20,240
whereas the cellular, the extracellular concentration of calcium is very high.

164
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:29,210
And so there are mechanisms for maintaining that homeostasis and also transporting ions back and forth when they're needed, needed to be.

165
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:34,129
And then cells have to be able to synthesize endogenous molecules.

166
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:45,260
So a neuron needs to be able to make neurotransmitters a cell that is in the pancreas that secretes insulin needs in order to synthesize insulin.

167
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:48,680
So these are all kind of basic functions of cells.

168
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:57,130
Specialized functions include movement like smooth muscle, skeletal muscle.

169
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:04,280
Also be able to conduct electrical impulses, as is the case for neurons and cardiac monocytes.

170
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:09,800
Conduct metabolic absorption in this.

171
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:13,820
This is common in renal tubular cells and in tests,

172
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:23,000
testing all epithelial cells where you're absorbing various nutrients, various ions in order to either,

173
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:32,630
you know, bring in nutrients from your food or to concentrate the urine and eliminate chemicals, waste metabolites from the body.

174
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:39,080
And then finally secretion. So the pancreas, the adrenal glands,

175
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:47,960
various glandular structures and toxicants can interfere with and interfere with any of these processes and lead to disease or injury.

176
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:57,480
So in order to maintain homeostasis, cells are constantly working.

177
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:02,220
Our cells are constantly encountering stressors, whether that's heat stress,

178
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:13,320
whether that's generation of of reactive oxygen species, whether it is UV radiation and other environmental exposures.

179
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:22,620
We're always under some sort of stress and cells, healthy, normal, healthy cells are able to adapt to those stressors.

180
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:26,040
So a healthy mechanism of adaptation would be, for example,

181
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:35,579
if you start take up running and in order to when your skeletal muscle and also your the cardiac

182
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:40,770
muscle in your heart that's going to that running is going to be a source of stress for your bones,

183
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:47,490
for your joints, everything. And if you apply that stress strategically and you don't overdo it,

184
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:56,580
the cells are able to adapt through hypertrophy of skeletal muscle through through building stronger connective tissue.

185
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,030
And also the heart will hyper hypertrophy.

186
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:05,339
So there is some hypertrophy and in the hearts of athletes, for example,

187
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:15,930
or anybody who takes up some activity and and does it often, if the cell can't adapt, then of course there's injury.

188
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:22,140
And hopefully if the injury is mild or transient, then it's reversible.

189
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:29,280
But if it's a more progressive injury, then cells have progressed to necrosis,

190
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:38,370
which is the form of cell death that is not ATP dependent and the cells swell and end up bursting and releasing their contents.

191
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:43,470
Apoptosis, as we're going to a little bit in this class,

192
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:49,469
is an ATP driven process that's a little more organized and things are kind of chopped

193
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:55,470
up and the cell kind of shrinks and it's engulfed by macrophages or other cell,

194
00:23:55,800 --> 00:24:00,600
other immune cells in the body, and things are cleaned up.

195
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:09,000
So necrosis is tends to be associated with more inflammation, whereas ptosis is again a more ordered process.

196
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:22,170
Now I'll say that this is a very, very simplified discussion, a very simplified breakout of what happens at a molecular level with cell death.

197
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:29,780
There are many researchers who are studying a bunch of other types of mechanisms of cell death.

198
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:36,990
It gets more nuanced, things like ferroptosis and there's other ones.

199
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:43,410
There's other types of cell death that are nuanced versions of either of these.

200
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:51,330
But for the purposes of this class, I think that this is an appropriate way to think about it.

201
00:24:54,510 --> 00:25:03,569
So how does a toxicant actually cause damage? We talked a little bit about how it has to be delivered to its target and either

202
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:08,399
has to interact with the target molecule and or alter the biological environment.

203
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:22,350
So this would be a chemical such as a DNA damaging agent that's going to interact with with bases in DNA and cause some some elimination of the DNA,

204
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:30,070
for example, then alteration of the biological environment would be something like an acid or some chemical that,

205
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:33,810
you know, perturbs the H in that environment and can cause.

206
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:41,310
Both of these are capable of causing cellular dysfunction and injury and toxicity results,

207
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:46,710
particularly if there's inappropriate repair and the inability to adapt.

208
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:57,140
And we'll talk in a little more detail today about cellular dysfunction and injury and repair and annotation.

209
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:06,500
So several factors can influence the delivery of the toxicant to its target site.

210
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:20,090
And this includes absorption versus pre systemic elimination if it if it's efficiently distributed to or from the target if it's reabsorbed.

211
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:27,170
We talked about inherent in taro hepatic cycling last on Monday or is it efficiently excreted?

212
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:31,490
Is it converted to a more toxic metabolite or is it detoxified?

213
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:40,550
All of these mechanisms kind of compete to influence the interaction of the ultimate toxicant with its target molecule.

214
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:44,360
And this includes proteins, lipids, nucleic acids,

215
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:50,810
other macromolecular complexes proteins tend to form these big macromolecular

216
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:55,670
complexes or chemicals can interfere with the formation of those complexes.

217
00:26:55,670 --> 00:27:01,190
And that has really important implications for things like regulation of gene expression in others.

218
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:08,180
So toxic zation versus detoxification or detoxification.

219
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:15,590
Both of those words are kind of used interchangeably. A toxicant can be converted to a non toxic metabolite and eliminated.

220
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,660
I'm just going to put these all up here,

221
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:31,840
and that's detoxification or the toxicant can be converted to a reactive metabolite and interact with target molecules.

222
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:38,560
And this may be repaired or there may be some adaptation that can occur.

223
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:46,690
But in the case of extended insult or let's say somebody is in poor health or

224
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:51,370
they have for some reason they're more vulnerable to the effects of a chemical,

225
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:57,280
they're more likely to have an inefficient repair and adaptation process and result in toxicity.

226
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:05,590
And there is some interplay between the formation of nontoxic versus reactive metabolites.

227
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:10,540
One example of that is acetaminophen, which I'll talk about in just a moment.

228
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:19,410
So some toxicants require metabolic activation and this is called toxic patient.

229
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:25,510
As I mentioned, I added a couple of things to I modified a few slides.

230
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:33,970
I'm going to post the updated slides after this class. So don't worry about trying to put this additional information in your notes or anything.

231
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:40,840
But I thought that this was a nice illustration of the fate of acetaminophen.

232
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:52,719
So if we're a normal, healthy individual and you take acetaminophen and it goes to your liver, there is looking around sedation.

233
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:57,190
And so patients remember phase two metabolism that occurs on that acetaminophen.

234
00:28:57,850 --> 00:29:11,710
And it converts and converts this chemical to a metabolite that's nontoxic and able to be excreted from the body.

235
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:17,860
But then there's also glutathione on conjugation that can occur as well.

236
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:29,770
But if you have somebody who is an alcoholic and alcohol is known to induce cytochrome p450, it's also known to deplete glutathione.

237
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:38,589
So you have a kind of a double whammy here. So you have increased expression of some cytochrome p450 and you have decreased glutathione.

238
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:48,999
And then what happens is this acetaminophen is metabolized to this and a PK UI metabolite and this is the very

239
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:56,350
toxic metabolite that can go on and damage proteins and nucleic acids and cause fulminant liver failure.

240
00:29:56,680 --> 00:30:00,940
And acetaminophen is kind of a nasty kind of in acetaminophen.

241
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:09,579
Toxicity is rather insidious in that there is a delay in terms of from the time that

242
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:16,569
you ingested toxic dose of acetaminophen and the time that you develop liver failure,

243
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:21,580
severe, irreversible liver failure is on the order of a couple of days, two or three days.

244
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:28,780
So you may think you're okay and you're in the clear and then develop liver failure.

245
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:33,480
So this is where I was talking about kind of, you know,

246
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:41,050
there's this sort of dynamic equilibrium between the formation of the toxic metabolite and the non toxic one.

247
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:48,370
And this is also going to be important when we talk about carbon tetrachloride.

248
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:56,230
So carbon tetrachloride is converted to this nasty tri plural radical that I'll talk about.

249
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:05,330
And if you have carbon tetrachloride exposure in the presence of something that induces cytochrome p450,

250
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:09,220
you're going to get greater toxicity from the carbon tetrachloride.

251
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:15,580
And then there was a couple of things I just wanted to mention on here.

252
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:21,410
So yeah, so chemicals like led to total toxins, dioxins.

253
00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:33,559
These things are toxic like right away they don't need any additional processing to become toxic, but things like ethylene glycol, acetaminophen,

254
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:36,049
carbon tetrachloride benzoate appearing,

255
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:44,360
these are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons that are converted to these reactive oxide intermediates and things like the.

256
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:59,370
Cytotoxic chemotherapy agents, many of them Paraquat, which is a pesticide, are converted to these damaging free radicals.

257
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:05,129
So there are a number of chemicals. You don't need to memorize all of these.

258
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:07,740
I just wanted to provide some good examples.

259
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:21,900
So the second step for a toxicant to to cause its toxicity is to interact with a target molecule or alteration of the biological environment.

260
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:27,750
What do you think are some attributes of an ideal target molecule, you thought?

261
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:41,730
Yeah. They have maybe like nonspecific receptors on their membrane for the toxicant to be able to bind to it.

262
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:45,690
Yeah. Yeah. So you have to have some ability to bind to the toxicant, right?

263
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:51,360
Yeah. It's kind of similar, but it just has to be like overall reactive.

264
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:55,450
Like, I feel like that's one level of reactivity, I guess.

265
00:32:55,470 --> 00:33:04,650
Yeah. Yeah. Granted, you know, I was just saying this might be a dumb answer, but like, I guess the accessibility, you know, factor,

266
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:11,480
like, you know, like our epithelial cells and cells that are like the first line of defense, I guess you could say.

267
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:17,010
Yeah. Towards a toxicant. Yeah. It has to be able to get to the site, right.

268
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:25,649
Yeah. So you see something similar. I know that some I guess some targets could be like protected by like other proteins or like made inactive.

269
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:28,950
So maybe something that isn't protected like that. Yeah. Yeah.

270
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:38,070
So this idea of steric hindrance can block the interaction of a toxicant with its target molecule.

271
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:43,530
So appropriate reactivity or steric configuration and accessibility.

272
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,750
And you guys all nicely cover covered these.

273
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:57,630
So there are different types of reactions, chemical reactions that can occur between a toxicant and some target molecule.

274
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:08,910
One example is non covalent binding. These are interactions in which you don't have a sharing of electrons in the way that you do in a covalent bond.

275
00:34:09,810 --> 00:34:17,610
Things like hydrogen bonding. And so here is an example of hydrogen bonding that occurs between two water molecules.

276
00:34:17,910 --> 00:34:26,280
So you have your more negatively charged oxygen and you're more slightly more positively charged hydrogens and then negative.

277
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:34,290
And the positive the negative in the positive atoms attract each other.

278
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:46,410
And so this is not a like a covalent bond where you're sharing electrons, but this is a super important mechanism for interaction that occurs.

279
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:57,930
For example, it's really important for maintaining normal protein structure as we'll talk about and as well as other processes in the body.

280
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:06,239
Covalent bonding is something like. So the the bond between the hydrogen and oxygen is a covalent bond.

281
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:16,110
So you have some sort of sharing of electrons between these two molecules or these two atoms, hydrogen abstraction.

282
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:24,510
This is a reaction that occurs in cytochrome p450 is quite often in the generic reaction is shown

283
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:30,720
here where you have this hydrogen reacts with this free radical and generates a free radical,

284
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:32,520
a second free radical species.

285
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:42,690
Electron transfer is a type of reaction that occurs for oxidation and reduction reactions where you have a gain or a loss of electrons.

286
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:49,049
That's an electron transfer reaction and those are super important in mitochondria.

287
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:52,890
For example, for mitochondrial electron transport chain,

288
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:59,190
you have electrons being shuffled through the different complexes of the electron transport chain.

289
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:04,140
You know, you're probably getting nightmares going, thinking back to your biochemistry.

290
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:14,399
We don't need to memorize that. Don't worry. Well, we'll talk about how some chemicals target mitochondria for sure that I think are interesting,

291
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,820
but you don't need to memorize the electron transport chain or anything.

292
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:23,850
And then also enzymatic reactions which you might expect are very critically

293
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:32,250
important for function of cells and organs and maintaining or keeping us alive.

294
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:39,690
So what are the some of the ways that toxicants damage cells as we talked about, there's membrane damage.

295
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:48,120
Dysregulated protein function gene dysregulated gene expression, DNA damage there probably most certainly others.

296
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:59,010
But these are kind of for the really big ones. So getting into membrane damage first, what is a membrane?

297
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:03,510
I'm just going to pull out some groups. Okay.

298
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:08,880
So we already talked about kind of the importance of a lipid bilayer membrane.

299
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:18,659
It functions as a barrier to the environment. It helps define boundaries, so it maintains differences between the cytosol extracellular space.

300
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:21,960
I talked about maintaining a calcium gradient.

301
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:30,390
Sodium potassium gradients are really important. They maintain differences between intracellular organelles and the site as.

302
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:40,220
This is again. There are organelles that store calcium and release it into the cytosol as needed.

303
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:48,410
There are also. This is also really important in mitochondria and they maintain iron gradients.

304
00:37:49,490 --> 00:37:53,570
I ingredients are really important for ATP synthesis in the mitochondria.

305
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:58,490
And I'll talk about one example of a chemical that targets ATP synthesis.

306
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:06,610
They drive transmembrane movement of solutes. They help facilitate conduct conduction of electrical impulses,

307
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:12,320
and they contain proteins that are important for communication with the external environment.

308
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,380
So some examples.

309
00:38:17,810 --> 00:38:27,500
So proteins that communicate with the extracellular environment I talked about, I touched on this a little bit over the last day or two of class,

310
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:36,410
but I didn't really emphasize that the proximity of signaling molecules within the lipid bilayer is critical for signal transduction.

311
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:45,980
So for example, if you have a if you have, there's not one on here to grow a membrane protein.

312
00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:58,550
If you have a receptor, let's say it's the A receptor for estrogen, you have estrogen receptor on the cell surface.

313
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:03,120
Insulin is a better example. You have an insulin receptor on the cell surface.

314
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:09,440
Insulin binds to that receptor. It activates these various pathways which aren't shown here.

315
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:22,760
That results in this translation of effects down to the nucleus to activate changes in gene expression, to activate other metabolic processes.

316
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:27,650
So insulin very important and glucose regulation and fat storage.

317
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:35,809
And if these proteins are not close to each other like they're supposed to be, then they can't interact.

318
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:40,760
So some of the signal transduction depends on these proteins being close enough to be able to talk to each other.

319
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:53,210
And what happens is some chemicals can alter membrane fluidity, and then these proteins get kind of dispersed and they don't work as effectively.

320
00:39:57,620 --> 00:40:09,559
So it's ten after right now. Why don't we go ahead and take a five minute break and we'll come back at 1215 and then we'll continue because again,

321
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:14,090
this thing is, I know, get kind of long listening to me talk.

322
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:40,360
Try not to drink too much water behind the wheel as the ambulance is going on.

323
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:49,350
You know, that's a memory. So I think that know I was there, I was like, this is how.

324
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:57,680
Then she told me this. So. But she said.

325
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:12,100
Would you. Would you like to? Yeah, I'm I'm looking forward to it.

326
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:21,500
I was like, um, just so really, um, um, I was gonna audit, you know, how it is.

327
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:25,920
Like the classes show up in the different sections, like in the Public Health Electives Requirement section,

328
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:32,010
like the classes though, they're like in the list, the pop culture numbers and all those.

329
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:34,780
But I think it was because God,

330
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:44,010
it doesn't show anything in everything that you take it only shows like that's enough to fulfill the requirement and stuff that makes sense.

331
00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:45,050
Like for example,

332
00:41:45,090 --> 00:41:53,100
like the opening of little boxes part which could be like an African class and I have the time like it's all set for my sophomore year.

333
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:59,280
So I was like, okay, you know, I just, I guess it went to like check with her.

334
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:04,490
Like, you know, if I jump forward to like will pop culture show up on my, on there,

335
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:08,950
like, I don't want to accidentally drop it and then be like, Oh [INAUDIBLE], I need it.

336
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:16,150
But it was in high school and I dropped it and then in about back showed up in some.

337
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:24,100
Yeah. Yeah. So I, I was either I was going to choose between one or two in pop culture and we both graduated.

338
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:32,880
That was my situation. Yeah, yeah. I know where to find the answer.

339
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:37,610
I'm gonna be okay. I'm going to get those crazy.

340
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:41,950
And I just. They were these your stage lectures. Okay, I guess.

341
00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:46,400
And but maybe jump out a little doctor you.

342
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:50,820
So, you know, I'll do this one if I'm choosing.

343
00:42:54,260 --> 00:43:00,339
I have say I think this is a class that is really on the fence about dropping it.

344
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:04,569
But I was just like another day. I don't need it.

345
00:43:04,570 --> 00:43:12,770
I'll just have to has the. Oh, do you know what I mean?

346
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:16,520
THOMPSON No, I don't think she's in that class.

347
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:21,160
And she oh, I don't think I remember she sat next to me on my first day.

348
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:27,770
She really was nice. If you get the chance to go talk to them, where should I find her?

349
00:43:28,130 --> 00:43:34,320
You know, that is the latest news.

350
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:46,879
And so when you think of it, it got pretty bad when they said, oh, yeah, I said that just a minute ago.

351
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:58,410
Now, you were in the office at the open the day you were doing this.

352
00:43:58,430 --> 00:44:11,810
Well, that's good for you in the first place, that you have to prove that it is the people's will the next week or in two weeks.

353
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:15,620
It will start on Wednesday.

354
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:19,230
Next week? Yeah. Okay. I'm just, like, the best.

355
00:44:20,810 --> 00:44:24,020
Yeah, cause we have Monday off next. That's Monday.

356
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:32,600
Yeah, I realize that. That's a short notice for for you all, so it's not a big deal.

357
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:36,350
We want to. He'd rather do one of the ones later in the semester.

358
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:47,610
Yeah. So, yeah.

359
00:44:48,890 --> 00:44:58,480
The ones where his own business.

360
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:17,390
Oh yeah. Okay. Well, you know what these kids are doing in the class, so I'll go ahead and we go ahead and continue here.

361
00:45:21,490 --> 00:45:30,380
Okay. So some examples of membrane damage and this can include chemical alteration of the lipid membrane.

362
00:45:30,830 --> 00:45:38,719
This would be, for example, a chemical that causes lipid or protein peroxidation, for example, carbon tetrachloride,

363
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:46,130
which is a classic toxicant that causes lipid peroxidation altered membrane fluidity,

364
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:52,480
as I mentioned, things like detergents and solvents, dissipation of ion gradients.

365
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:59,770
An example of that would be to for denatured phenol. This was this is an interesting chemical if you Google this,

366
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:09,290
it is a it was a chemical that was used back in the day by people who wanted to lose rapid amounts of weight.

367
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:18,139
And the reason that it causes weight loss is that in the inner mitochondrial membrane,

368
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:24,380
you have the electron transport chain that results in a proton gradient in the inner,

369
00:46:24,470 --> 00:46:29,050
inner mitochondrial membrane or the inter membrane space of the mitochondria.

370
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:37,129
So here, this proton gradient that's built up and this is critically important, you need this proton gradient to generate ATP.

371
00:46:37,130 --> 00:46:43,550
So ATP is generated by your mitochondria through the dissipation of a proton gradient.

372
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:52,549
And what happens is that too far di nitro phenol pokes holes in this membrane and

373
00:46:52,550 --> 00:46:58,280
allows protons to leak through so they aren't going through the ATP synthase.

374
00:46:58,610 --> 00:47:02,390
In generating ATP, they're just kind of leaking through elsewhere.

375
00:47:03,110 --> 00:47:15,530
And what happens is ATP, that metabolism is cranked up in order to compensate for this loss of this proton gradient.

376
00:47:15,530 --> 00:47:20,810
So you're trying to keep generating that proton gradient because you're losing it more rapidly.

377
00:47:21,410 --> 00:47:28,490
And increase that increase in metabolism generates a lot of heat, burns a lot of calories.

378
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:32,600
So you are burning a lot of calories and losing weight.

379
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:42,320
You're also if you if you take too much of it, it generates dangerously high fevers and it has killed a lot of people.

380
00:47:42,650 --> 00:47:47,030
And so it was banned a long time ago. I can't remember the specific timeline.

381
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:58,280
I believe this was used during one of the wars by the Russian military in order for people to keep people warm when they were out in the cold.

382
00:47:58,790 --> 00:48:09,950
So it's an interesting chemical, but it's one example of how chemicals can dissipate ion gradients and what happens with.

383
00:48:10,230 --> 00:48:20,219
Any of these is that you can get electric electrolyte imbalances cells can swell because the the size of the cell

384
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:27,570
and the amount of water inside versus outside the membrane is critically dependent on the gradient of ions,

385
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:33,720
disruptions and protein synthesis at the rough endoplasmic reticulum,

386
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:41,819
disruptions that endure in energy production in mitochondria and alter signal transduction inhibition of ATP synthesis,

387
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:53,040
which is that example over there. So how do detergents alter membranes at a low detergent concentration?

388
00:48:53,700 --> 00:49:03,420
So detergents have a similar structure to a fatty acid in that they have a a hydrophilic head and then this polar tail.

389
00:49:03,870 --> 00:49:18,060
And so how detergents work is that they interpolate into these membranes and they alter membrane fluidity at low doses and at a high concentration.

390
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:26,760
They actually will break apart the membrane entirely. And this is how they're used to to as as cleaning agents.

391
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:34,380
It's also how if you have done any any of the you like basic science and you've done any basic science research,

392
00:49:34,830 --> 00:49:44,550
if you are wanted to do a protein isolation in the lab, so you had like some cells and you wanted to get some extract the protein from those cells,

393
00:49:44,850 --> 00:49:50,759
you would add a detergent and that detergent tears up the cell membranes and soluble lysis the proteins.

394
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:52,470
And this is how you isolate protein.

395
00:49:52,920 --> 00:50:01,920
But as you might imagine, if you inhaled detergents in your lungs or if you have have high concentration of detergents in your GI tract,

396
00:50:02,190 --> 00:50:07,530
that that's probably going to be toxic and cause burns and all sorts of damage.

397
00:50:07,530 --> 00:50:12,629
And you all remember the Tide Pod challenge and then all sorts of these ridiculous challenges.

398
00:50:12,630 --> 00:50:15,840
There's something with chicken to blanking on it.

399
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:19,080
I'll find it because I just absolutely absurd.

400
00:50:19,590 --> 00:50:25,020
And one of the biggest one of the biggest causes of air visits from this time pod

401
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:30,360
challenge was people inhaling it accidentally into their lungs and destroying their lungs.

402
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:34,200
So yeah, just profoundly stupid.

403
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:43,500
Um, an example of a chemical that causes lipid peroxidation is carbon tetrachloride.

404
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:47,640
This one has a very some very complex metabolism,

405
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:58,470
but it is metabolized primarily by cytochrome p450 is to this tri plural radical and then it's tried for a radical has multiple fates,

406
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:07,710
one of them being reaction with lipids, which generates this chain reaction of free radicals and destroys lipid membranes.

407
00:51:08,130 --> 00:51:12,810
It's also metabolized to lovely things like carbon monoxide and phosgene.

408
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:26,520
So this is an industrial chemical that has caused toxicity in a lot of people who don't properly use PPE, ethanol.

409
00:51:28,050 --> 00:51:34,860
So chronic ethanol consumption is associated with an increased risk of various cancers the oral cavity, the pharynx,

410
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:44,970
larynx, esophagus, esophagus, oral, esophageal, squamous cell carcinoma, alcohol such as ethanol, alter membrane fluidity.

411
00:51:45,870 --> 00:51:54,990
And so they disrupt a lot of different function of ion channels and signal transduction pathways.

412
00:51:55,440 --> 00:52:02,610
And it's an important potential indirect mechanism by which chronic ethanol consumption can lead to diseases like cancer.

413
00:52:02,970 --> 00:52:12,150
There's also all sorts of you know, when you look at the epidemiology of the connection between alcohol and consumption and cancer,

414
00:52:12,990 --> 00:52:14,370
there's lots of confounders,

415
00:52:14,370 --> 00:52:20,849
things like people are also smoking and they're also engaging in other unhealthy behaviors that are probably promoting the cancer.

416
00:52:20,850 --> 00:52:30,600
But ethanol does seem to have some direct effect on cancer causing cancer alcohols

417
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:35,490
can potentiate the effects of other toxicants through induction of cytochrome p450.

418
00:52:35,970 --> 00:52:39,960
And this is important for the carbon tetrachloride case study.

419
00:52:41,670 --> 00:52:50,750
So since I. I neglected to mention this to you last week.

420
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:59,749
I'm just going to pull it up really quickly. I was going to have you just give it a quick read before class and then I got sidetracked.

421
00:52:59,750 --> 00:53:12,410
So it's really short, though. So why don't we take just about 4 minutes or so and you can pull it up on canvas in the module for this week.

422
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:25,100
So if you go to, um, you go to module and January 11th, it's right here, this case study.

423
00:53:25,310 --> 00:53:32,060
I had the wrong date on it because I use, I, we, I used it last year too in this class was on January 12th last year.

424
00:53:32,360 --> 00:55:35,790
But yeah. Oh, the chance to.

425
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:42,630
You still need a minute? Okay.

426
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:53,069
I don't think we need to divide up into partners. This is such a small class.

427
00:55:53,070 --> 00:55:56,190
But what do you think happened here?

428
00:55:56,190 --> 00:56:00,150
Why do you think the man who had been drinking fared so poorly?

429
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:04,830
Great. Well, I had a clarification question as well, so.

430
00:56:05,010 --> 00:56:09,329
Yeah, of course fluorocarbon does. Is that what?

431
00:56:09,330 --> 00:56:12,780
Like if they're in a closer contact with the paint shop?

432
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:15,780
You said it causes that carbon monoxide.

433
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:20,010
Oh, I think it goes up. Oh, never mind.

434
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:23,999
Oh, no worries. That's a different way than on it. Yeah, yeah.

435
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:29,700
So carbon tetrachloride was I don't, I don't know how often it's used industrially now,

436
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:37,440
but it was used for chlorofluorocarbons, manufacturing for example, and I think it has other uses as well.

437
00:56:38,970 --> 00:56:42,330
Of course, chlorofluorocarbons got banned a long time ago.

438
00:56:42,330 --> 00:56:53,489
They were used as refrigerants in, in, um, but they were found to react with the ozone layer and yeah,

439
00:56:53,490 --> 00:56:59,940
so they're in this chlorofluorocarbons manufacturing facility and they're handling the sweet smelling chemicals.

440
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:11,580
So carbon tetrachloride, a lot of organic solvents have a sweet smell to them and the guy who has a hangover decides to take off his respirator.

441
00:57:12,630 --> 00:57:17,640
So why do you think he's the one who had the more severe toxicity?

442
00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:25,200
Is it because, um, alcohol increases the production of it, so.

443
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:28,740
Yeah. And more toxicity. Yeah.

444
00:57:28,770 --> 00:57:38,999
Yeah, absolutely. And I thought it was interesting that he had this they had this extra little detail about how he decided that

445
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:43,770
he got in a fight the prior evening and spilled isopropyl alcohol all over himself and didn't clean it up.

446
00:57:44,430 --> 00:57:50,069
The bother to change his clothes. These are actual medical case studies.

447
00:57:50,070 --> 00:57:53,310
So there's all sorts of interesting ones with various toxicity.

448
00:57:53,850 --> 00:57:57,899
Yeah, yeah. Josh Maria, a quick question.

449
00:57:57,900 --> 00:58:05,600
Um, if the other two individuals also kept their respirators on, why did they also get like,

450
00:58:05,730 --> 00:58:09,450
why were they getting just because it was still ventilated like a hot room?

451
00:58:09,450 --> 00:58:15,029
Yeah. Yeah, I think that was a big part of it is there's all sorts of, you know,

452
00:58:15,030 --> 00:58:19,649
controls an industrial environment, you have the PPE and then you also have to have proper ventilation.

453
00:58:19,650 --> 00:58:28,680
And yeah, it sounds like this. This factory was not well was not OSHA inspected recently, too?

454
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:32,700
I was just going to mention that he also was more effective because he didn't have as much return.

455
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:37,829
And so, yeah, inflation and not getting directly into, I would assume into his bloodstream.

456
00:58:37,830 --> 00:58:41,740
Yeah. That's why he got so much worse then.

457
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:45,479
Yeah, absolutely. So we had multiple insults, right.

458
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:52,350
Because he had a higher dose, higher exposure and he had, you know, some toxicity,

459
00:58:53,070 --> 00:58:57,930
the ethanol type potentiated, the effect of the department tetrachloride exposure.

460
00:58:57,930 --> 00:59:03,719
So this is probably I haven't gotten into this in a lot of detail yet,

461
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:12,660
but any thoughts on so based on how so based on how carbon touch of chloride works, it causes these free radicals.

462
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:18,780
It causes oxidative stress. What what might we be able to administer to somebody with carbon tetrachloride

463
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:24,360
toxicity to to mitigate the effects of this exposure and the presentation?

464
00:59:28,250 --> 00:59:37,250
So if it's the substance, you know, upregulated, then it is a good time to, you know, work against the system then.

465
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:48,170
Yeah, absolutely. So there have been some studies showing that administering glutamate, ion, administering and acetyl cysteine,

466
00:59:48,170 --> 00:59:59,959
which is a precursor to glutathione on administering the precursor amino acids to glutathione on like cysteine 16 has this sulfide group.

467
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:03,470
I'll get into the importance of sulfide overlaps later in the class,

468
01:00:03,470 --> 01:00:12,890
but that's the component of mutazione that scavenges the free radicals and so so yes there's been some work

469
01:00:12,890 --> 01:00:20,480
looking at how you might be able to administer antioxidants or these glutathione precursors as a as a treatment.

470
01:00:21,350 --> 01:00:29,390
I'll note that the antidote for or the treatment for acetaminophen toxicity,

471
01:00:29,870 --> 01:00:38,629
when you get that reactive metabolite and subsequent oxidative stress is aniceto cysteine, which is a precursor to glutathione on.

472
01:00:38,630 --> 01:00:44,120
And that's a well-established clinical treatment for acetaminophen overdose.

473
01:00:45,370 --> 01:00:50,290
Um. So yeah. What other lifestyle factors might affect the work?

474
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:53,620
Workers susceptibility to carbon tetrachloride toxicity.

475
01:00:54,330 --> 01:01:06,440
The other factors you can think of. This is more of a speculation.

476
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:13,120
There's not necessarily. A definitive, correct answer.

477
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:17,980
He has, like, chronic alcohol use. He could have liver damage.

478
01:01:18,220 --> 01:01:22,140
Hmm. Yeah. So maybe. Maybe. If. If.

479
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:29,920
Yeah. They may go out and party and get wasted the night before, but they also may just drink regularly, you know, at lower doses.

480
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:33,070
That's going to be a problem. Sleep patterns.

481
01:01:33,490 --> 01:01:38,950
Yeah. Sleep habits. You can think of things that, you know, like.

482
01:01:38,950 --> 01:01:47,890
Like poor sleep increases systemic inflammation and impairs your ability to respond to all sorts of stressors.

483
01:01:49,030 --> 01:01:52,780
I don't know if anybody has actually done a that would be really interesting research study to

484
01:01:52,780 --> 01:02:01,510
do is how how sleep deficit deficits affect our vulnerability to to acute chemical exposures.

485
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:11,980
But there is a lot more interest in the importance of sleep and its role in prevention of diseases like Alzheimer's disease,

486
01:02:11,980 --> 01:02:18,040
cardiovascular disease, diabetes. So yeah, that could be a really important lifestyle factor for sure.

487
01:02:19,940 --> 01:02:23,200
Yeah. Yeah, I see no smoking habits.

488
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:29,140
Yeah, it's current that's required that you need to recover your blood.

489
01:02:29,170 --> 01:02:32,710
Yeah. So the habits that. Absolutely.

490
01:02:34,230 --> 01:02:37,980
Yep. He already had that high baseline level of carbon monoxide.

491
01:02:37,980 --> 01:02:40,470
You're probably already going to be in trouble.

492
01:02:41,010 --> 01:02:49,950
And you have all sorts of nasty chemicals and cigaret smoke that upregulate all of these cytochrome p450 is another other enzymes.

493
01:02:51,510 --> 01:03:01,380
So yeah, that's kind of a, I think a nice illustration of how, how these chemicals can interact and how our lifestyles can influence toxicity.

494
01:03:02,460 --> 01:03:08,570
Um. So moving on to dysregulated protein function.

495
01:03:10,310 --> 01:03:17,270
So what are some functions of proteins and different ways that toxicants can interfere with those functions?

496
01:03:17,940 --> 01:03:25,610
And we we touched on a few of these already, but any others that you can think of before we move into the section?

497
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:39,420
They create enzymes which basically catalyze the major metabolic reactions in our body.

498
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:48,720
Mm hmm. And if they are not functioning properly, the basic mechanisms like Glycolysis and Genesis can't perform.

499
01:03:48,810 --> 01:03:58,110
Absolutely. Yeah. A lot of enzymes have have a particular like a sulfide group at their active site.

500
01:03:58,290 --> 01:04:05,220
And so reactive oxygen species can come in and and react with that sulfide or group and inactivate the enzyme.

501
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:10,980
Any others? Let's go ahead and jump in.

502
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:20,999
So proteins perform a lot of critical functions. I've mentioned these already, but essentially they're critical for maintenance of cell structure,

503
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:26,310
signal transduction, metabolism, excitability and proteins.

504
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:30,960
The function of these proteins depend on their three dimensional structure.

505
01:04:31,350 --> 01:04:43,600
So taking you back a little bit to some biochemistry, proteins have a primary structure, a secondary, tertiary and quaternary structure.

506
01:04:44,490 --> 01:04:48,960
The primary structure of a of a protein is its sequence of amino acids.

507
01:04:49,680 --> 01:05:00,930
And these amino acids can assemble into these basic secondary structures like alpha helices and beta strands.

508
01:05:02,060 --> 01:05:11,150
And these alpha helix and beta strands in turn can fold up over upon themselves

509
01:05:11,150 --> 01:05:17,540
in three dimensional space to form this large three dimensional structure.

510
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:25,850
And these. These different structures are mediated by hydrogen bonding, for example,

511
01:05:25,850 --> 01:05:36,110
which I mentioned also Van der Waals forces, which are a weaker force even then than than hydrogen bonding.

512
01:05:36,530 --> 01:05:43,999
Hydrophobic packaging. So hydrophobic regions of a protein you're going to want to hide inside here.

513
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,670
If you have this folded three dimensional structure,

514
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:54,440
the hydrophobic parts are going to be inside and the hydrophilic parts are going to face the the aqueous side of things.

515
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:56,210
And then disulfide bonds.

516
01:05:57,050 --> 01:06:05,540
If you look at the structure of insulin, for example, it has it has disulfide bonds that promote the formation of its structure.

517
01:06:05,570 --> 01:06:16,790
This is really important for all sorts of proteins and then flatten every structure which is the functional assembly of how they like a single.

518
01:06:16,940 --> 01:06:24,140
This would be like a single subunit of a protein. And how do they assemble into this large multi subunit complex?

519
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:31,120
And this is really how chemical or how proteins in the body generally function.

520
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:40,550
So an ion channel, for example, is comprised of multiple individual subunits, and they work together to perhaps some biological effect.

521
01:06:43,890 --> 01:06:48,540
So toxicants can damage proteins in a number of ways.

522
01:06:49,830 --> 01:06:58,050
They can alter protein, conformation and structure by interfering with hydrogen, bonding by oxidation of dial or self hydro groups.

523
01:06:58,290 --> 01:07:12,000
So again, these are the this age group critically important for scavenging reactive oxygen species also forms inter and intra molecular disulfide.

524
01:07:12,530 --> 01:07:20,189
You want to form disulfide bonds in the right places, right? You don't want to form it with some other random protein floating around.

525
01:07:20,190 --> 01:07:31,019
And then you get these aggregates and misfolded things that are no longer functional and cause toxicity protein.

526
01:07:31,020 --> 01:07:43,499
So PHENIX of Onyx authentic acids, these are gradual progressive oxidation of the salt hydro groups that these have important signaling functions,

527
01:07:43,500 --> 01:07:48,540
but they particularly sulfuric acid which is like the most oxidized form.

528
01:07:48,900 --> 01:07:58,440
So three, you don't need to have that memorized or anything, but that tends to inactivate a protein and market for cellular cellular degradation.

529
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:01,920
So cell will recognize that as a damaged protein and get rid of it.

530
01:08:03,060 --> 01:08:13,500
There's also al collection of functional groups that can occur such as on enzymes, but toxicants can cause dysfunction without damaging proteins.

531
01:08:14,190 --> 01:08:20,310
And a couple of you mentioned that already interfering with gene expression,

532
01:08:20,910 --> 01:08:30,300
which is mediated by protein protein interactions and protein DNA interactions and also which I talk about,

533
01:08:30,390 --> 01:08:36,930
I think I have that in here somewhere, maybe not mimicking endogenous protein ligand.

534
01:08:36,930 --> 01:08:45,270
So if a if you have estrogen by the kinds of estrogen receptor and has its biological effect,

535
01:08:45,780 --> 01:08:52,050
a chemical that mimics estrogen is going to turn on those pathways inappropriately.

536
01:08:52,590 --> 01:09:02,879
That's a very common endocrine disrupting mechanism. Chemicals that inhibit androgens chemicals tend to be estrogenic and or anti androgenic.

537
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:14,040
So they have a feminizing effect generally inhibition of enzymes, receptors, ion channel dysfunction.

538
01:09:14,190 --> 01:09:23,489
We'll talk about this. I have a couple of more detailed slides which I think are interesting after after this in today's class.

539
01:09:23,490 --> 01:09:26,990
But we'll also get into this a little bit in the neuro toxicology section.

540
01:09:27,270 --> 01:09:31,420
Do you have a question? Yeah, I do. It was for the gene expression.

541
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:39,580
Ha. I don't know if it's like the same thing, but would that be towards like, you know, to treat?

542
01:09:39,750 --> 01:09:53,010
So I guess, yeah, there are certain hypo spatulas or, you know, feminization of frogs, for example.

543
01:09:54,390 --> 01:10:01,320
There's like and again, disruption does result in many cases and some phenotypic effect.

544
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:03,809
Is that kind of what you were getting at? Yeah. Yeah.

545
01:10:03,810 --> 01:10:12,030
And we have a class on endocrine disruption where we talk about I think it's the case study on the poly brominated by phenols.

546
01:10:12,780 --> 01:10:16,439
I think that was the the one that I coupled to the endocrine disruption lecture.

547
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:19,800
But we'll expand on this a little bit more in that section of the class.

548
01:10:20,550 --> 01:10:26,160
Yeah. Um, a lot of chemicals can bind to cytoskeleton proteins,

549
01:10:26,670 --> 01:10:34,890
so the cytoskeleton of a cell needs to be able to dynamically assemble and disassemble as the cell is moving, as it's dividing.

550
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:38,760
And there are a lot of chemicals that can interfere with this process.

551
01:10:39,060 --> 01:10:48,630
Many of them you may recognize the names. If you have any experience with cancer biology, then blast in paclitaxel, trivalent arsenic.

552
01:10:49,710 --> 01:10:52,950
These are cytotoxic chemotherapy agents.

553
01:10:53,280 --> 01:11:00,120
And they they work by interfering with this process of dynamic assembly and disassembly

554
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:06,840
of actin and tubulin components of the cytoskeleton and the cells freak out and die.

555
01:11:06,870 --> 01:11:16,889
And so this rapid in rapidly dividing cells where you're getting more of that assembly, in this assembly, those cells are going to be more vulnerable.

556
01:11:16,890 --> 01:11:22,320
And so that's why these agents are effective in treating cancer.

557
01:11:24,390 --> 01:11:31,140
And then chemicals can also form neoantigens. Nicole, for example, a lot of people can't wear nickel,

558
01:11:31,620 --> 01:11:41,400
a jewelry that contains nickel because they develop an allergy to it and that they they bind to proteins and then that chemical protein.

559
01:11:41,470 --> 01:11:50,740
Like that Nicole protein complex. The immune system recognizes that as as a problem and elicits an immune response and an allergic reaction.

560
01:11:53,170 --> 01:11:56,950
So how do proteins repair oxidative damage?

561
01:11:57,910 --> 01:12:06,550
There are a couple of pathways, and if you go any further in toxicology, you'll hear about these a lot.

562
01:12:07,330 --> 01:12:17,049
The cell, relax and pathway and the glittery toxin pathway not necessary to memorize the specific details of these pathways just kind

563
01:12:17,050 --> 01:12:29,350
of have an understanding that there are these important pathways for treating oxidative or repairing oxidative damage.

564
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:34,090
So in proteins are oxidized, the file groups can form protein disulfide.

565
01:12:34,630 --> 01:12:43,690
As I mentioned, if you have a situation where you have these proteins are supposed to be in a reduced state and you have some oxidative stress,

566
01:12:43,690 --> 01:12:49,240
then they become these self hydrogens become oxidized and form a disulfide bond where there shouldn't be one.

567
01:12:50,830 --> 01:12:59,139
There are mechanisms for reducing those disulfide bonds, not only disulfide bonds,

568
01:12:59,140 --> 01:13:06,310
but also I mentioned something like acid or so phonic acid is also reversible.

569
01:13:07,420 --> 01:13:21,790
And so a reduction is a protein that reacts with these oxidized target molecules and reduces them back to their native state.

570
01:13:22,330 --> 01:13:27,100
And in the process, the theory dioxin itself becomes oxidized.

571
01:13:27,490 --> 01:13:35,590
And so there's a final reduction reductase enzyme that goes in and re reduces the fiery dioxin so that it's able to go on and.

572
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:44,940
React with other proteins that have been damaged by oxidative stress.

573
01:13:45,690 --> 01:13:48,989
There's a similar pathway for literally dioxin.

574
01:13:48,990 --> 01:13:57,190
So proteins that have undergone react reduction by a conjugation tablet of iron.

575
01:13:58,050 --> 01:14:03,870
There's a glittery vaccine that generates regenerates the protein with a grain of salt

576
01:14:04,830 --> 01:14:13,910
and provides that glutathione on back and in the process would have iron is good.

577
01:14:14,230 --> 01:14:22,530
The reaction is oxidized and so there is a process to re store that glittery toxin to its reduced state.

578
01:14:23,130 --> 01:14:36,240
These both of these processes use any BP, any BPH and that's another common cofactor for shuttling protons and electrons around in cells.

579
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:44,399
Again, this is a lot of detail that you won't need to know specifically down to that level of granularity,

580
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:50,580
but just know that formation of disulfide bonds and other oxidized components

581
01:14:50,580 --> 01:14:55,260
is really common in cells and there are mechanisms for repairing that damage.

582
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:04,350
You can also interfere with protein. Toxicants can also interfere with protein trafficking.

583
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:14,970
So things like ion channels, for example, have this dynamic process of so if they're out on the cell surface,

584
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:19,920
they can be internalized and recycled back to the cell surface as they're needed.

585
01:15:20,790 --> 01:15:27,780
So cells have like to reuse and recycle things and not have to make new proteins every time they need them.

586
01:15:28,260 --> 01:15:32,820
So they might just take some of them and hide them in intracellular vesicles until their children need it.

587
01:15:33,330 --> 01:15:40,590
And things like oxidative chemicals that generate oxidative stress can interfere with this normal process of trafficking.

588
01:15:42,780 --> 01:15:55,790
So. You don't need to know all the details of this particular example, but just to highlight that protein trafficking is also vulnerable to toxicants.

589
01:15:58,490 --> 01:16:04,520
I briefly want to touch on sodium channels and their role in generating an action

590
01:16:04,520 --> 01:16:09,890
potential just to highlight the next couple of slides and then we'll call it a day.

591
01:16:11,240 --> 01:16:17,600
Don't worry if this is like a lot and then I'm going through this quickly, we're going to touch base.

592
01:16:17,810 --> 01:16:22,040
We're going to revisit this again in the neuro toxicology lecture.

593
01:16:22,040 --> 01:16:31,630
So we'll get get this in more detail. But essentially, a sodium channel allows sodium from the outside of the cell to enter the inside of the cell.

594
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:35,480
And that's a really important component of an action potential.

595
01:16:35,750 --> 01:16:39,650
And so in the sodium channel, the sodium channel is inactivated right here.

596
01:16:40,790 --> 01:16:43,970
When it's activated, that sodium rushes in.

597
01:16:44,720 --> 01:16:48,530
And then after the sodium is entered,

598
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:57,950
there is a this kind of ball and chain structure on this protein and that comes in and shuts down the channel so that it can't let any more sodium in.

599
01:16:58,700 --> 01:17:07,429
And what that looks like at the level of an action potential is that you get a a rapid depolarization of the

600
01:17:07,430 --> 01:17:15,830
membrane when the sodium rushes in and then you get a following phase when potassium would potassium movement.

601
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:22,460
So I don't have the potassium on here, but it's a balance between sodium and potassium that generates action potentials.

602
01:17:23,030 --> 01:17:31,729
And as you might expect, chemicals that interfere with sodium channel function are going to cause big problems.

603
01:17:31,730 --> 01:17:40,500
Right. Because you need to have you need to be able to generate action potentials at the neuromuscular junction, for example, heart.

604
01:17:40,610 --> 01:17:47,120
That's how our nervous system controls are. Our muscles really important for things like breathing, especially.

605
01:17:47,870 --> 01:17:54,139
And so chemicals that inhibit sodium channels are going to be a real problem.

606
01:17:54,140 --> 01:18:02,390
Right. This is, as I mentioned, proteins form these large multi subunit structures.

607
01:18:02,750 --> 01:18:07,430
So sodium channels have these multi multiple subunits and there are different

608
01:18:07,430 --> 01:18:13,670
toxins that combine different areas of the sodium channel to inhibit its function.

609
01:18:14,150 --> 01:18:25,940
One example is tetrodotoxin, which is found in Japanese pufferfish and they find in these cute little lizards newts.

610
01:18:26,450 --> 01:18:35,059
And this is an article from about 20 years ago now where every known mammal

611
01:18:35,060 --> 01:18:39,110
spits them out instantly except men in bars who have been drinking heavily.

612
01:18:39,470 --> 01:18:45,470
And this 29 year old, some guy's like dared him at a bar to eat a new any eight one and died.

613
01:18:46,010 --> 01:18:54,050
So in other you know a lot of really stupid things that people do and provide some really interesting stories to highlight toxicology.

614
01:18:57,470 --> 01:19:05,150
And I'm going to react I really only have a minute left, so I'm going to leave off here.

615
01:19:05,420 --> 01:19:10,040
We'll get into these other neurotoxins in more detail in the neuro toxicology class.

616
01:19:10,040 --> 01:19:16,010
But this is a really I just nerd out over this stuff like this is a really interesting chemical to it.

617
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:24,240
How it how it was discovered and used throughout history has been just a really interesting story.

618
01:19:24,260 --> 01:19:32,450
This is another chemical that blocks acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction and essentially it causes paralysis.

619
01:19:32,900 --> 01:19:38,540
And this this guy actually tested this on himself.

620
01:19:39,380 --> 01:19:41,690
So back in the day, nobody really knew how this worked.

621
01:19:42,770 --> 01:19:50,960
And it was perfectly acceptable for people to do self-testing or testing, you know, populations of people without informed consent.

622
01:19:52,280 --> 01:19:56,210
And he tested this on himself and had other people in the room.

623
01:19:57,650 --> 01:19:58,730
And what it did.
