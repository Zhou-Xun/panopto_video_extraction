1
00:00:05,332 --> 00:00:08,690
So in this module I'm going to talk
about assessing qualitative data.

2
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:12,970
So these are some ideas for thinking about
how you as a researcher can do your best

3
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:16,730
job presenting good qualitative data and
then also as a consumer or

4
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:19,510
reader of the qualitative
health literature,

5
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:23,830
you can think about how to
assess the quality of the data.

6
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:25,950
So what are good qualitative data?

7
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:30,320
We talk about credibility,
dependability and confirmability.

8
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,560
So credibility gets a kind of asking the
questions, are our data trustworthy and

9
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,340
why should we believe
the results that we're reading?

10
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:40,700
Credibility is established
through rigorous methods.

11
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,980
Thinking about the credibility of the
researcher who is conducting the research

12
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,480
or presenting the research,

13
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,790
it's also kind of a general belief
in the value of qualitative methods.

14
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:52,810
We can establish integrity in our analysis

15
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:57,300
by recognizing that the researcher shapes
the findings and making these biases that

16
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:01,290
the researcher might bring to
the presentation of results explicit.

17
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:06,535
And also then searching for and discussing
other ways of interpreting our data.

18
00:01:06,535 --> 00:01:10,575
We can also use negative case analysis
to establish credibility to our data.

19
00:01:10,575 --> 00:01:14,965
And this is where we search for
cases that do not fit with the analysis or

20
00:01:14,965 --> 00:01:16,805
the conceptualization.

21
00:01:16,805 --> 00:01:21,415
Negative cases may be exceptions to
the argument we're putting forward.

22
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:28,190
Or they may help broaden or change
how we are conceptualizing the data.

23
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:32,650
So, we can also triangulate our
findings by using multiple methods,

24
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:38,175
multiple data sources, or multiple data
analysts, to overcome the bias, look for

25
00:01:38,175 --> 00:01:43,840
insistency in our data, and understand
the inconsistencies in our data.

26
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,190
So, in using triangulation,
we can use multiple methods,

27
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:51,150
that might be combining quantitative
data and qualitative data.

28
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:55,600
We can also use multiple sources of data,
so it could be interviews with patients,

29
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,830
combined with interviews with providers.

30
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:02,310
Or interviews in-depth interviews and
participant observations.

31
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:05,580
We can also use multiple data analysts or
sources of input.

32
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:10,635
So this could be different people doing
the data analysis using multiple coders.

33
00:02:10,635 --> 00:02:15,410
You can also review the findings
with participants by kind of taking

34
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:18,280
your results and
ideas back to the community.

35
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,780
And also part of triangulation
is review our findings with

36
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:25,130
our knowledgeable informants or
experts in the field and

37
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:29,950
also bringing in the published
scientific literature.

38
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:34,050
So the idea of dependability in our data,
asks us to think about the extent

39
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:37,640
to which patterns in our data
remain stable over time.

40
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,920
Our research is considered dependable when
we ask questions that are clearly and

41
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,920
logically connected to the research
purpose and study design.

42
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,430
Dependability is established when we see
similar patterns across data sources.

43
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:54,660
And when multiple interviewers have
comparable data collection protocols, or

44
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:58,850
multiple coders use
a well defined code book.

45
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:02,860
Confirmability asks us to show that those
are the ideas of the participants and

46
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,930
not the idea of the researcher.

47
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:07,960
So you as a researcher should leave
what we call an audit trail, so

48
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:12,130
you can track how you came to
the conclusions that you did.

49
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:15,520
People often ask about validity
in qualitative research and

50
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,500
I would say that there are three
important points to consider here.

51
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,530
First, validity threats are made
implausible by evidence,

52
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:23,190
not by the methods.

53
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:23,990
But second,

54
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:28,110
methods are a way of getting to evidence
to help rule out threats to validity.

55
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:32,934
And third, remembering that you are not
out to measure an objective, truth but

56
00:03:32,934 --> 00:03:34,886
establish a credible account.

57
00:03:34,886 --> 00:03:39,509
So, in conclusion, when assessing
the validity of qualitative research,

58
00:03:39,509 --> 00:03:45,140
we look at the credibility, dependability
and confirmability of the results.

59
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:49,180
And rigorous methods and thorough
description of the process are crucial to

60
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:52,933
producing good qualitative research.
