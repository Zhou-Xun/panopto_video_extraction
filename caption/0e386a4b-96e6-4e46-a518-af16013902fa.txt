1
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:40,260
And now that have. Everyone is welcome.

2
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:44,970
So Mia's in Greece right now. Having an amazing time.

3
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:55,379
I'm very jealous. So I am going to, you know, we're going to learn about Bertha's together and all of, you know, what's going on and everything.

4
00:00:55,380 --> 00:01:01,500
But first and foremost, I wanted to let you know, making some announcements.

5
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:09,060
And so I got some e-mail from some of you guys about in-class assignments and it's not counted towards regret.

6
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:15,149
So you can play with it, you can start your grades. So I know some of you had asked me, it's not counted.

7
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:18,990
And I have been like great in yours, which is totally fine because you know,

8
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:23,820
me automatically told me I don't have to check if each and every one of you have done it,

9
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:31,290
you know, because it's not counting towards your grades, it's more for your quiz, which is basically the thing class assignment.

10
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:33,360
If you do it, it's going to help you with the quiz.

11
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:45,600
And so again, the next point brings me to the quiz one, which opens today after the class at 515 and it's due on Friday at nine, not Saturday.

12
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,950
So we all just wanted to let you know that it's not due on Saturday through Friday night.

13
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:57,270
And it covers the what we learned at the U.S. Census Biophysicist and Heinz on purpose today

14
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:02,070
and then also some aspects of in-class assignments and it is counted towards your grade.

15
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:10,379
So you have to do it. I believe it is timed. I know some of you have reached out to me about accommodations, so let me know if that's not the case.

16
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:15,690
Feel free to email me, but not at like night but like during like normal hours.

17
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:25,829
But I will be on emails over the the weekends too if you guys need me and also find the link on Canvas Home page.

18
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:29,940
Just wanted to let you know if you guys I mean this is my,

19
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:40,710
you know on teaching assistant sort of a view but you guys have to go to home and then this is the way to access your quiz.

20
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:44,100
I'm not going to start it. I guess there's no time limit here.

21
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,760
But I mean, if it is time because when I tried it, I thought it was.

22
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:58,950
But so that's how you access it. Just wanted to demonstrate and show you guys their plan for today is, you know, just roughly 330.

23
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:06,839
I'm going to go over the overview of the purpose and then we're going to also do a group assignment which includes staff and exercise,

24
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:16,049
spend time on virtual site. So hopefully those sort of tests that you guys can do individually and kind of help each other as a group.

25
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:20,760
Or you can also do just like one person. If you have a fast on your computer, great.

26
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:25,950
If not for an individual. So and then I'm going to ask you guys to sit with your groups.

27
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:31,860
So for the in-class assignment, you don't have to do it with the groups.

28
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:39,240
But I think around 410, I'm going to just check in and then ask you guys to sit with your groups and then work on the final group project.

29
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:43,590
So anybody have questions about this before I move on?

30
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:55,270
So purpose is stands for behavioral risk factor surveillance system.

31
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:01,540
I wanted to sort of go over this timeline first since the Burford started was established in

32
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:10,299
just 15 think by the participants in all the states back in 1984 and then move on to 1993.

33
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:15,220
Purpose became nation wide and there was about 100,000 interviews completed.

34
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:20,230
And then 2005 the asthma callback survey started,

35
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:27,579
which is a self study because Asthma Foundation wanted to know more about people's behavior related to asthma.

36
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:35,020
Sort of like purpose is more helpful for the chronic diseases and conditions and for preventing chronic diseases.

37
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:35,860
And so on.

38
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:44,830
2000, they piloted the cell phone survey, which also talk about the advantages and disadvantages of cell phone surveys as opposed to the landline.

39
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:55,180
And then 2011, the cell phone survey study became public, really released the data itself, and then about 500,000 interviews were conducted.

40
00:04:56,110 --> 00:05:02,260
So going back to the definition and sort of what it is and so the national system of health related

41
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:09,819
telephone surveys collect collected at a state level and so it's available on a state specific basis.

42
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:13,690
And so noting that NHANES does not have a state specific data.

43
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:21,639
And so I think purpose is significant in a sense that it has a state specific data and it collects the people,

44
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:29,110
U.S. residents, regarding their health related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions and use of preventative services.

45
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:32,890
Like I said, it started in 1985 with just 13 states,

46
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:41,200
and it became nationwide and that it's conducted by the CDC and not the not the and Hanes via the vital statistics.

47
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:48,399
So a purpose was collect purpose, collect these four different kinds of questions.

48
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:55,330
And so first standard core questions it asks every year and has has to be asked by all states.

49
00:05:56,140 --> 00:06:01,750
So it's it includes sort of like questions including just, you know, like your demographic questionnaire.

50
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:07,599
There are other rotating core questions that are asked every other year and has to be asked.

51
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:13,900
The States optional includes a set of questions that states may or may not ask.

52
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:19,989
So states have that. And then the last one is a state audit question.

53
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:27,190
So certainly the states are interested in more of the other categories of health than the other.

54
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:31,570
So I wanted to also sort of show you what kind of questions.

55
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:38,740
So if you go to I just, you know, typed in birth questionnaire and so you have this.

56
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:44,979
And so some of the questions that we're going to I'm going to ask you later in the in class, exercise has to do with obesity.

57
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:56,170
And so let's just go to 2021. I'm just going to type in Moscow, do control and then obesity or maybe weights.

58
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:03,729
And so these are, you know, just lists like the questions, the kinds of questions that they ask.

59
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:12,220
And so, for example, this is a code of that question, you know, and so asked about how much do you weight without shoes over the phone.

60
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:16,839
So if you're asked by phone, how would you answer that question?

61
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:24,969
Just think. You don't have to say it out loud, but just think about what you're going to say and then what you would actually weigh in person.

62
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:29,530
So, so just think about those kinds of things like what are the advantages of asking

63
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:35,109
people certain kinds of questions over the phone versus actually measuring,

64
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:38,710
which is what Ben Haines does? And so I just wanted to point that out.

65
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:43,330
Oh. I wanted to go from.

66
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:54,900
Okay. So I actually also wanted to just mention about offshore modules, but that's okay.

67
00:07:54,910 --> 00:08:01,030
So moving on to core modules, like I talked about some of the questions that they ask the subset of,

68
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:05,220
I mean, I'm not going to go over all these, you guys can read it, but I'm just starting.

69
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,060
So these are the questions that everybody, all the states have to ask.

70
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:20,739
I think we didn't add the the rotating core questions, but so these are some of the questions that you have to ask people important questions.

71
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:28,060
And then the optional modules are states can either pick and choose to ask these questions or not.

72
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:33,669
And so again, I'm not going to read it, but there are four modules national address and purpose.

73
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:40,389
So it's to really interesting like what's the data is going to be very different by states, so keep that in mind.

74
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:48,670
And so participation there are no conversations because adults over 18 are asked to participate.

75
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:56,020
So keep that in mind and hence we give people conversations, but we don't.

76
00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:04,959
And these are telephone interviews and numbers are generated through random digit dialing and then like and hey,

77
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:11,740
that's not a simple random sample and it uses weights and design variables in the analysis like we talked about last week.

78
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:21,219
So in terms of the response rates, it's also interesting to compare between Haven Berkeley's response rates and this.

79
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:31,360
You can see from 1999 to 2000, the campaigns response rate was about 80, 81.9%, which is really high versus surface.

80
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:37,930
It's just about 55.2. And then it actually even decreased 48.9.

81
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:43,780
And then you can also just see across these years and Haynes versus surface,

82
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:49,510
the numbers are very significantly different where they're both have much lower response rate.

83
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:57,309
Ben and Haynes have much higher rate. So which is which is good to know when you're doing data analysis.

84
00:09:57,310 --> 00:10:02,440
And so also this is comparing between landline and cell phone response.

85
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:11,200
I think remember I talked about I think around like 2000 or something like that versus sort of cell phone interviews.

86
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:16,900
And so this is sort of about the advantages and disadvantages of cell phone rate is like I think it's a cell phone.

87
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:27,820
You can reach more variety of people. But whereas like landline we have higher in Michigan but then, you know, like it's about the same in Maryland.

88
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:35,920
And so cell phone rates vary so much by states and, you know, by ear, I'm sure, you know, when people are available.

89
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:42,819
And so like cell phone rates are eight cell phones are able to reach variety of people versus it just vary so much by state.

90
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:48,729
So it's it's sort of, you know, it gets maybe interesting data but then also very sort of unreliable.

91
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:56,080
So you really have to do waiting just wanted to go over the summary.

92
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:00,760
The similarity is I would just like to look at the time,

93
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:07,930
but so the similarities and enhancement purposes that these are both cross sectional and cover

94
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:13,269
some of the same information about how the differences and how you think those children.

95
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:18,069
Whereas like breakfast and kids only adults over 18 and Haines has no state level data,

96
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:27,580
whereas focus does enhances and in-person interviews and it's collected by an actually trained person versus purpose

97
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:34,600
is all self-reported over phone then and Haines offers compensation for participant whereas like for his cousin.

98
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:43,210
So you can kind of see like, you know when, when you have a study question and then see, okay, what kind of data you want to get to.

99
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:46,870
And but you also have to think about like how these data are collected, of course.

100
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:53,929
And as you guys all know, and then understanding these similarities and differences will help you understand what kind of things do.

101
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:57,100
Why compensate for, like in terms of biophysical kind of things?

102
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:08,350
Am I just going to going to assume versus not so when you're doing these in they're of the both and Hayes and purpose has to be way to if you're

103
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:19,900
not waiting awaiting these analysis you're assuming that they both have equal probability of being selected the participant which is not true.

104
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:27,579
And so you have two weeks and we're going to do that over using fact as well as I'm going to read all of these.

105
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:42,460
But so let's move on to I'm really fast here, but let's move on to the exercise so you can click on the link to access the your assignment.

106
00:12:46,940 --> 00:13:01,240
Anybody have questions at this point or. I think we're going to spend more time.

107
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:19,010
That's okay. I'll just. I think we're going to spend more time working on the virtual fights to for Assad.

108
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:39,450
So I think that's that's fine. So I'm going to give you guys like maybe 10 minutes to work on this thing.

109
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:44,870
First question and then we're going to go over it together.

110
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,510
So I'll just let you guys sort of work through and work with your groups.

111
00:13:49,140 --> 00:14:10,590
And then we gather 10 minutes. We're.

112
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:25,520
After. Her.

113
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:37,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

114
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:44,270
I have a hard time. Guess.

115
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:13,620
Think. He could have.

116
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:46,510
Last year. You know.

117
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:07,120
First. Yeah.

118
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:19,920
Know, you definitely have compassion for that.

119
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:39,530
Are. 1543.

120
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:43,220
We're having cider and none of that in here.

121
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:47,380
Yeah, we said I was afraid of.

122
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:51,990
No, actually, I think I'm in the class.

123
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:58,270
Does your class like this? Classes. And why?

124
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,610
It's really, you know, everyone. It's like, well, I don't know.

125
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:08,780
But I'm just. I'm just kind of baffled that. Organizers said it.

126
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:12,040
It's like a family. Or is it?

127
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:27,440
I don't know. But in the end, the farms maybe they like it looks like it's not even set up ahead of time.

128
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:31,910
I think they just say, well, this is a fly and you couldn't be in the car.

129
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:43,240
Okay. Yeah, I just. I just. Police have found a crew known as insider as British media led them out and have public.

130
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:51,510
Well, here's the thing you need to hear about. Like what classes this is required for student visas.

131
00:17:52,540 --> 00:18:02,580
Which one is the sort? The 43 weeks have been by.

132
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:09,280
He was so interesting. The word of the not.

133
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,840
Okay. We my. But now.

134
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:22,509
Yeah. Yeah. I just came in here because I wanted to help with the aid, but it's not even set up yet.

135
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:29,229
And he was doing it at the last minute. And actually I'm also recording it.

136
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:38,630
So this is. We know.

137
00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:08,920
So. So it was good.

138
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:12,050
I didn't go to.

139
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:33,250
I've never had a friend. Her rolling.

140
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:47,760
Was. Yeah, well, that.

141
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:04,500
Oh. And then just.

142
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:16,050
And then to give you options of how. So you can.

143
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:29,070
Obviously that's going to be. But we're also interested in 1982.

144
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:37,080
I don't think so. I think they want the crew to.

145
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:56,570
But there's just too many. But if you just keep going down, then you're going to.

146
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:05,079
And what? Water is also needed.

147
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:20,530
So we need to know where we got it. Then the game.

148
00:21:28,240 --> 00:22:24,620
So. You.

149
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:47,940
I am committed. So that's going out.

150
00:22:52,300 --> 00:23:00,720
Yeah. But in the past couple of years.

151
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:32,850
Okay. Maybe. And that.

152
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:41,100
And I thought for the families that was.

153
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:59,590
The other. So.

154
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:18,810
I know there is. That.

155
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:39,770
Something, just. Is.

156
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:47,390
Yeah. Seven.

157
00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:00,890
And then I. The.

158
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:17,320
Yeah. And that's a. Yeah.

159
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:21,980
I mean, there are certain things that I think are nice.

160
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:29,000
And then they. A measure that's been.

161
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:38,070
Yeah. And so the end of that.

162
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:51,740
Yeah. Yeah.

163
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:57,010
Guess. I think. Yeah.

164
00:25:57,650 --> 00:26:07,660
Yeah. Okay.

165
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:10,700
So I can also just demonstrate, you know, this.

166
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:16,600
I thought maybe it's, you know, easiest to kind of just show you what we are in our thinking.

167
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:29,470
And so if that's cool, perfect. So I'm going to just go through this and then go to prevalence data and tools, which is this.

168
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:34,330
And then it asks me to go to purpose, prevalence and trends data.

169
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:38,890
And so then we have Explorer represented by location.

170
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:43,600
So I think this is really cool in the sense that you can look into these specifics.

171
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:57,130
But the question to go to request data is overweight, obesity and all things in D.C. So I'm going to go to D.C. here.

172
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:06,220
I think it's also really cool that I don't know if you just saw it also enclosed territories, whereas again, change those.

173
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:09,550
And so that's really cool.

174
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:22,570
And so I'm going to go to overweight and obesity BMI category and just, you know, do here honestly and see what pops up.

175
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:28,299
So yeah, I think another thing that I want you to do is just sort of like exploring,

176
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:31,870
I guess, and you know, like maybe 30 questions going to come up or something.

177
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:40,329
But so you go to all available years and you also have these options to look into data and tables.

178
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:49,630
And so you go to the tables. And so the question requests the data of overweight and obesity and sleep and all that.

179
00:27:50,440 --> 00:28:00,440
And so the prevalence of obesity, which means the percentages of these would be so the numbers are these here.

180
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:06,280
And so I'm going to then go back maybe a few more years and then go to.

181
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:17,570
Let's see. So 19 starting from 1999, but tomorrow, maybe from here.

182
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:35,470
There you go. Just to get back to that.

183
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:44,660
Yeah. And all over you. Hmm. Well. I'm going to go to 1989 here.

184
00:28:49,720 --> 00:29:00,430
Oh, there it is. There's the option there. So the answer I get is 19.6.

185
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:11,590
I would put 19 19.6 here, 20% here, and I said 21, 20.9.

186
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:17,380
So that's that's how you do it. I'll get any question.

187
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:23,290
So I most excited for a number to exercise.

188
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:26,530
Are we ready to move on to number two? Okay.

189
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:34,630
So we're going to use fast now. Anybody in this group or like just anybody has class and their computer.

190
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:43,650
That's right. So, one, two, three, four, five.

191
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,600
So you guys actually hobbies in your life since you're in that virtual thing?

192
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,950
Okay. Awesome. You guys are going to have much easier time with that.

193
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:56,660
But all the rest of the people, you can either follow it or just, you know,

194
00:29:56,930 --> 00:30:04,100
observe other people in your group doing this, too, if you just feel like it's going to be too much.

195
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:11,450
But we will have fun. So for virtual flights, people or people have it in their computer to open it virtual.

196
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:15,080
So people have been able to use virtual things and obviously do it again.

197
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:22,750
I heard it here and then go to virtual fight.

198
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:38,530
I thought there was a way where it's like, well, maybe that's all right virtual that we're on the Wolverine access and I think of that.

199
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:50,850
All right. I'm going to assume we're good now. Let me know I'm open and I just do the each HTML that to type in.

200
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:56,490
Certainly something has pass through your head.

201
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,630
Yeah. Right. Because everybody here.

202
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:09,850
Are you going to carry? Are.

203
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:26,180
The fact that. Yeah.

204
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:37,570
What's the. I've had it for the last three.

205
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:45,800
It was pretty nice to be able to do that. Yeah, I know.

206
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:55,900
All right. We're going to go to Virtual Coming. Oh.

207
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:13,380
Are. No. Of.

208
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:31,100
But it was. And.

209
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:44,300
Okay. The people. Open your side.

210
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:50,750
At least one person in your group. Okay. Mine still working on us.

211
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,680
But I just wanted to make sure people can get to it.

212
00:32:58,730 --> 00:33:02,240
But first, let's just go over number two again.

213
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:07,160
So we're going to get our data. So Google and Heinz.

214
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:14,850
I know some people are already up, you know, ahead of everything,

215
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:19,410
but I'm just going to go through this with you so that she's questioning her date of birth.

216
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:27,180
Which is over here on the left side and.

217
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:37,430
Under Data two 718 1999 to 2001.

218
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:47,090
Ban the questionnaire and under data choose demographics.

219
00:33:50,250 --> 00:34:01,320
And then click on the link data file card. And so that file downloading, so it's in an x p t file format.

220
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:08,730
So we're going to have to change that into fast format later. Actually, the something you don't have access codes, right?

221
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:14,860
I might have forgot to upload it. Let me just do it quickly so that you're not seeing what I'm doing.

222
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:31,000
But. I feel.

223
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:43,470
I was talking to her.

224
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:46,160
Everything has to be said. I think that this has.

225
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:56,460
Okay. Now, you should be able to see the south coats here. Sorry about that.

226
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:12,890
Somebody's got to go home.

227
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:18,470
Oh, okay. Cool. So I alerted the staff code there.

228
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:22,400
We're not going to use it just now, but. Sorry. I'm, like, all over the place.

229
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:26,450
But anyway, so we go to the database.

230
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:34,519
So we just downloaded the demo at p t and go back and then click the examination data.

231
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:37,400
So I know the fact and examination that is here.

232
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:49,190
And then I think the question says we go to body measures, which is over here, so then click on the data file.

233
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:58,460
So we're gonna download all these data files from here.

234
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,770
What does that repeat this until 2011 to 2012.

235
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:05,870
So you're going to repeat that six times.

236
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:19,790
So again, I know it's kind of tedious, although I do make this in class, but for 2001, it's going to have the others show you again here.

237
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:26,389
And then I go to examination data and then party measures.

238
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:31,820
All right. So we're going to repeat that until 2011 and 2012.

239
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:37,010
So, yeah, I'll see you again in 5 minutes.

240
00:37:56,510 --> 00:38:03,000
N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A.

241
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:29,400
Native Americans. Well.

242
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:44,450
Hall. South Side was.

243
00:38:54,830 --> 00:39:13,600
They're not here for. You.

244
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:28,420
Yeah. Now.

245
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:45,180
She? Yeah.

246
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:19,630
I never said. I've been.

247
00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:31,970
You don't have to do that.

248
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,150
Did you get? Yeah.

249
00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:26,130
Okay. Hi everyone again.

250
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:33,830
So, like I said, if you have downloaded everything, it should be on your download from just regular BMX.

251
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:43,430
BMX, which is the sum of that going, the demographic, the here, the body measure, BMX all the way up to G.

252
00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:48,469
So once you've done that now this is the tricky part.

253
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:52,900
So if someone asked me, Oh, where do I find my file on SAS?

254
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:57,200
So this is the kind of tricky, especially if you're using the virtual site.

255
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:08,180
So this is how to navigate your through your virtual box and if any anybody, if you have or, you know, stuff on your computer file, that's great.

256
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:12,610
You should just be able to like download the file and then just run it too,

257
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:19,699
because it's already like all the file names and everything should be matching and it shouldn't, it should run without any problem.

258
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:24,230
But if you have qualified, I just want to show you how to do the shortest.

259
00:42:24,450 --> 00:42:33,349
So I went to my Dropbox, just type in, you know, you miss Dropbox and then it should drive you there and I am going to upload this.

260
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:37,580
I'm just going to make another file here, my folder.

261
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:45,490
Oh. And then also.

262
00:42:51,160 --> 00:43:08,330
And then upload all these. There's a very.

263
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:14,830
So it's been uploaded and then go back to virtual files.

264
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:18,580
So now if I go to the virtual site.

265
00:43:24,270 --> 00:43:40,120
You may have heard. Now.

266
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:52,590
I know. Yes.

267
00:43:56,790 --> 00:44:00,870
You have to log in to your Dropbox on your virtualbox to.

268
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:16,590
Here is what we expect later on this afternoon.

269
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:25,950
All right, so now you have. Are you guys here anyway?

270
00:44:26,510 --> 00:44:36,540
I know this is tedious. If you go to your drop advance and then download all these.

271
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:43,470
Yeah. And.

272
00:44:53,130 --> 00:45:14,260
Well. I'm going to give this to my and write it on your virtual phone.

273
00:45:17,790 --> 00:45:21,980
Can you confirm how many firefighters have gone out of 14?

274
00:45:22,890 --> 00:45:28,410
80. Okay, so this should make your stop.

275
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:34,290
But anyway, so I'm going to now go to South Bend. We know that.

276
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:48,720
And I must. I.

277
00:45:52,880 --> 00:46:04,360
So. We have.

278
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:26,350
What? I have no idea.

279
00:46:28,310 --> 00:46:32,320
Said. My virtual side failed me.

280
00:46:37,850 --> 00:46:54,850
Okay. So we can try it again. I know that that.

281
00:47:05,850 --> 00:47:19,530
Okay. Well.

282
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:48,630
N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A.

283
00:47:54,090 --> 00:47:57,260
So I have a few classes.

284
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:16,160
Oh. Yeah, I know that.

285
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:43,400
That. Your folder.

286
00:48:53,900 --> 00:49:02,480
The. Extremely committed.

287
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:10,840
That's a. Oh, sorry.

288
00:49:12,810 --> 00:49:23,170
I actually. Why?

289
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:41,970
Okay. Sorry, guys. I'm just going to use my staff on this computer here instead of virtual, so you can just tell how it works.

290
00:49:43,450 --> 00:49:58,900
So. So these are the codes I have.

291
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:03,510
I am so sorry. You are going to you.

292
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:30,950
Just make a pathway. And so. Well.

293
00:50:48,090 --> 00:50:56,880
I know, but I feel like I'm going to New York.

294
00:50:57,300 --> 00:51:10,650
I know. And.

295
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:20,990
After that.

296
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:35,230
That is. All right, I'm ready.

297
00:51:39,110 --> 00:51:42,739
Sorry. Okay, I'm not ready. That worked on me.

298
00:51:42,740 --> 00:51:46,040
So I'm going to go to and drive.

299
00:51:46,550 --> 00:51:56,390
And so as you can see the codes here, it starts with a load name and so inside SA and you have to make a pathway and then a nickname.

300
00:51:57,110 --> 00:52:00,290
And so the nickname is theta in this code.

301
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:06,980
And then the pathways that name 2021 is that you're going to make whatever your pathway is,

302
00:52:08,090 --> 00:52:17,360
make a folder named and Heinz 2021 and then put all your data into the enhanced 2021 folder.

303
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:21,380
So you should be able to access your end drive there.

304
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:28,610
And so once you have the enhanced 2021 folder, should have a folder named there.

305
00:52:28,670 --> 00:52:31,219
So you should, you're going to highlight it and then run.

306
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:41,870
And so then you look into your log and then it says that draft data was successfully assigned that followed so that let's just try and do that first.

307
00:52:48,470 --> 00:53:15,560
So. Is everybody going?

308
00:53:16,910 --> 00:53:21,460
Okay, we're going to. Here. This is the demographic files.

309
00:53:22,030 --> 00:53:30,530
And so since I had my demo, I've seen that we're going to have my name XP as the nickname again.

310
00:53:30,550 --> 00:53:36,280
And then next coordinates the AT&T stuff. So run that as well.

311
00:53:36,290 --> 00:53:49,540
And to forth copy this is going to use the XP folder and then put that they put the fat folder into the data to the run that is null and so.

312
00:53:53,650 --> 00:53:59,240
You know everything that. Exactly.

313
00:54:01,650 --> 00:54:06,540
Okay. So the same thing for all of this. So, again, lightning is.

314
00:54:09,370 --> 00:54:11,170
What did it make the fourth year?

315
00:54:11,530 --> 00:54:22,719
And to make that export, make the export into that file and then use the copy phone to copy all the experts into that file.

316
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:27,160
And you got a whole new Serrano van and so body and.

317
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:41,090
And then you check your log and then see if it doesn't have any, you know, errors if it's successfully done.

318
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:53,329
Okay. So then we move on to the demographic and again,

319
00:54:53,330 --> 00:55:00,530
it's just going to it's just keep doing the same thing changing we're right now changing the exact files and 2000.

320
00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:04,310
So we highlight all of this and then.

321
00:55:06,910 --> 00:55:13,860
We're done with the demo, so we're gonna do. So run of us.

322
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:22,579
Right. Okay. And it's been a through in here.

323
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:28,280
So we're gonna also then then merge the demographic files to body measure.

324
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:36,650
We have to sort the data and the demographics by the sequence, which is the primary key by the, the participants.

325
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:41,810
So we're sorting that and the demo and then also the body.

326
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:58,910
And it you get. So running all the fights in the 1999 to 2000 so far, again making sure that things and everything's working.

327
00:55:58,910 --> 00:56:05,150
And so then we merge the demo with the body measure by the sequence.

328
00:56:14,730 --> 00:56:28,080
Yes. And then we create the obesity variable so that in fact, BMI is the obesity dog means that that's missing.

329
00:56:29,250 --> 00:56:33,720
Then we the obese is now our variable that we're creating.

330
00:56:33,870 --> 00:56:37,020
And so we're saying that and is a missing.

331
00:56:37,030 --> 00:56:48,690
And so if the variable obesity variable in this demographic or the body metadata data is missing, then obesity is going to be missing.

332
00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:58,890
It's not. If those BMI are less than 30, which was the BMI cutoff, then the obese measurement is going to be zero.

333
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:05,910
If they are equal to or larger than 30, then there are going to be equal to 100.

334
00:57:11,180 --> 00:57:16,290
University. And so then the South setting on AIDS.

335
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:24,400
So this is where I talked about like waiting for the data.

336
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:35,240
And so because this data, we're going to subset it on stage and that is going to wait them and make them more generalizable.

337
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:42,839
So I won't go into too much details here, but basically it means the age over or equal to 18.

338
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:55,760
And if they are if the obesity is not missing, then they are going to be in the the strata one and if not, then they're two.

339
00:57:55,860 --> 00:58:06,690
And so we're repeating that. And again, we're sorting the demographic data by sequence and then we're sorting the body measure also by the sequence,

340
00:58:07,620 --> 00:58:11,190
and then we're merging the two by the sequence.

341
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:20,729
And then we create the obesity variable again, those who are less than 30 obesity in the body measure data,

342
00:58:20,730 --> 00:58:23,880
then we're creating the third or fourth obese zero.

343
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:31,490
And then if they are equal to or over 30, then they're hungry unless offsetting it on age group.

344
00:58:34,690 --> 00:58:42,550
So I would just literally highlight all of this and then run it all together and.

345
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:12,129
Okay. So making sure everything was okay on your lawn at this point.

346
00:59:12,130 --> 00:59:20,550
Is everybody there? Yeah. Okay.

347
00:59:20,550 --> 00:59:29,580
So now now that we've created our weight, we've created our obesity variable for the prevalence, and then we have merged all together.

348
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:39,240
And so then we're going to get the obesity prevalence estimate which we use from serving means for these, all of them,

349
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:49,350
but basically using the merged data and we basically create the straight island cluster statements for the variance,

350
00:59:49,350 --> 00:59:54,270
which basically something we do for this pop survey means.

351
00:59:55,470 --> 00:59:59,820
And then we are using those age sub settings.

352
00:59:59,820 --> 01:00:08,790
So setting on a page that we did for the weight weights in this data, we use the obesity to do that.

353
01:00:08,790 --> 01:00:16,200
And so then the title of this analysis is going to be obesity prevalence from 1999 to 2000.

354
01:00:16,590 --> 01:00:21,990
And you should be able to see this outcome output here.

355
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:30,600
And now you put the title and then the number straight or these,

356
01:00:30,630 --> 01:00:38,400
you don't really have to worry about it, but it basically shows that there have been 8462 participants.

357
01:00:38,850 --> 01:00:44,700
The mean of those, BMI is 23 without the weights at this point.

358
01:00:46,020 --> 01:00:53,879
And in 1999, the 2000 people were basically having a normal obese obesity rate.

359
01:00:53,880 --> 01:01:03,960
Here is the graph. And now we see the mean with the weights that's been adjusted for the weight.

360
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:15,020
So 29.5 something, whatever. And that's what you're going to put on your table now.

361
01:01:15,060 --> 01:01:27,030
So this number is what we've put here, 29.5 with statistics for the adjusted mean.

362
01:01:28,650 --> 01:01:32,850
So we do that over again.

363
01:01:47,810 --> 01:02:03,400
But. In 2001.

364
01:02:03,410 --> 01:02:09,440
This is the unadjusted mean and the adjusted mean is 29.65.

365
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:18,500
Four, 2003, the unadjusted is 31 and then the window to the adjusted is 31.

366
01:02:23,340 --> 01:02:28,710
And so on and so forth. Does anybody have question?

367
01:02:32,910 --> 01:02:40,600
Did we get to do that?

368
01:02:42,350 --> 01:02:47,070
Okay. I think that's my goal.

369
01:02:47,650 --> 01:02:54,760
And you're going to fill that out and then fill out those answers and then look at the

370
01:02:54,760 --> 01:03:01,900
trend and then answer these questions based on that stuff for the next 10 minutes or so.

371
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:22,680
And then let me know if you have questions. Future.

372
01:03:35,140 --> 01:03:44,020
I think. You, are you?

373
01:04:13,630 --> 01:04:19,340
I. Even, I guess, my only regret.

374
01:04:22,530 --> 01:04:40,490
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Is.

375
01:04:53,090 --> 01:05:08,760
I see. I haven't been able to.

376
01:05:52,280 --> 01:06:10,040
Yeah. Yeah. Of that.

377
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:49,730
Yeah. Yeah, I. I'm sure.

378
01:07:15,390 --> 01:07:41,170
I. Roger Federer.

379
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:57,280
My husband. They are homosexual.

380
01:08:01,770 --> 01:08:26,570
Well, we're going to. I.

381
01:08:46,810 --> 01:08:58,090
I certainly. I.

382
01:09:04,930 --> 01:09:16,450
Of. Yeah.

383
01:09:21,870 --> 01:09:29,880
Share. And that.

384
01:09:35,110 --> 01:09:56,600
Yeah, I guess that's. You.

385
01:10:00,830 --> 01:10:04,910
Right? Yeah. Yeah.

386
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:16,150
Hey, guys, these are the answers here. I'll see if they match with yours.

387
01:10:18,250 --> 01:10:24,250
And so the questions are. I just wanted to, you know, look it through together.

388
01:10:24,670 --> 01:10:28,780
And so the questionnaires look at the trends and obesity in each survey.

389
01:10:28,780 --> 01:10:31,810
And so, again, NHANES and versus their.

390
01:10:32,650 --> 01:10:36,160
In what ways do they look different? What was your answer?

391
01:10:46,840 --> 01:10:51,370
Yeah. Definitely, definitely. And think is higher.

392
01:10:52,360 --> 01:11:01,809
Both are increasing but and as enhanced data is higher and we'll see you know why that is the case in question number six.

393
01:11:01,810 --> 01:11:06,490
But moving on to the next one, how is the obesity assessed?

394
01:11:06,950 --> 01:11:12,969
And hey, so again, these these are not counterterrorist grade.

395
01:11:12,970 --> 01:11:26,410
But again, like wink, wink, it sort of relates to your quiz after this class bio and Haynes is done by Mac like a mobile measuring.

396
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:34,000
I don't know what it's yeah but it basically says that the mobile little clinics that they measured by, you know,

397
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:41,920
trained clinician, not clinicians, but they say trained research assistants that actually measuring you versus versus by phone.

398
01:11:43,330 --> 01:11:52,120
Question number five, how is obesity assessed? And, you know, again, self-reported telephone interview.

399
01:11:55,280 --> 01:12:00,130
And so last question. Number six, what do people think?

400
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:22,480
What are some answers that people got? So I sort of summarized that for you guys.

401
01:12:33,090 --> 01:12:42,570
Okay. So I know it might be a little bit too human, too much text here, but hopefully it will be helpful for your class.

402
01:12:42,580 --> 01:12:53,530
But it's basically purpose is self-reported and the weight is lower than measured, you know, on your phone because like if you think about it,

403
01:12:53,530 --> 01:13:02,739
if you when you're answering your weights and it's more likely that it's lower than what it actually when you how you actually weigh in.

404
01:13:02,740 --> 01:13:10,450
So that's important to think about. So that's going back to question number three.

405
01:13:11,380 --> 01:13:13,720
Both are increasing, but then he says higher.

406
01:13:14,110 --> 01:13:26,290
And so that's that's one of the reasons why and Hanes obesity prevalence was higher than Griffiths and Heinz as measured by trained

407
01:13:26,290 --> 01:13:35,199
professionals versus is more geographic has more geographic diversity and then Heinz does strive for ethnic and racial diversity.

408
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:42,999
But at the same time, purpose has more state focused data collection.

409
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:53,710
So there's more diversity there. And then the tougher surface is done by telephone interviews and depends it also depends on the telephone coverage.

410
01:13:54,280 --> 01:13:58,030
And that's why it's also prone to bias in that way,

411
01:13:58,030 --> 01:14:07,540
because it's done by small phones and that's that's why it's depends a lot on the telephone coverage and the response

412
01:14:07,540 --> 01:14:16,059
rate is lower just like we talked about before and then talking about the way it estimates for by education.

413
01:14:16,060 --> 01:14:29,190
So it turns out that breakfast has more over it's more represented by those people with higher education status than those with lower as we

414
01:14:29,470 --> 01:14:40,150
and versus and Heinz is more overrepresented by those with lower education status than higher than those people with higher education status.

415
01:14:40,150 --> 01:14:44,320
And so, I mean, that's basically done by, you know,

416
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:52,059
like when you are actually analyzing the education level of education by NHANES and breakfast, that's what people found.

417
01:14:52,060 --> 01:14:59,410
And so I mean, it's also depends by the friend demographic variables that you need to also look into.

418
01:14:59,410 --> 01:15:08,440
And that's why weights are important for to actually see the actual values of,

419
01:15:08,830 --> 01:15:12,430
you know, obesity or like whatever your your health outcome of interest is.
