1
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:07,340
Hey everyone I'll be doing a quick review for the TCA cycle and the ETC.

2
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:10,260
So, again always going through this real quick.

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:15,500
So now that we've covered glycolysis which is basically this chunk over here,

4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,939
now the TCA cycle is this surround parts over here and

5
00:00:18,939 --> 00:00:21,940
then the TCE cycle occurs after that.

6
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:26,941
Basically, familiarize yourselves with those conditions.

7
00:00:26,941 --> 00:00:33,229
So, under aerobic conditions if there's PDH activity pyruvate dehydrogenase

8
00:00:33,229 --> 00:00:39,160
activity is high, then you can make acetyl-CoA from pyruvate basically.

9
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,769
And then if you do not have carbs but you need energy,

10
00:00:42,769 --> 00:00:46,803
then this goes into the TCA cycle to yield the most energy.

11
00:00:46,803 --> 00:00:53,710
As mentioned earlier, it's 32 ATPs from FO glucose that goes all through the cycle.

12
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:56,491
And if you have oxaloacetate but you do not need the energy,

13
00:00:56,491 --> 00:00:58,111
then this goes into lipid stores.

14
00:00:58,111 --> 00:01:01,463
And then if there is no carbohydrates so no oxaloacetate.

15
00:01:01,463 --> 00:01:06,022
This becomes ketone bodies and then under anaerobic conditions, so

16
00:01:06,022 --> 00:01:10,592
there is no oxygen and there is no way you can go through the TCA cycle.

17
00:01:10,592 --> 00:01:17,740
Then acetyl-CoA and pyruvate is gonna become I mean lactate.

18
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:23,823
So the Cori cycle has mentioned, it makes a net of 2 ATP that the muscle can use and

19
00:01:23,823 --> 00:01:28,941
then the liver it uses 6 ATPs a year at a net loss of 4 ATP basically.

20
00:01:28,941 --> 00:01:33,023
But this is still good because as mentioned under any aerobic conditions,

21
00:01:33,023 --> 00:01:35,107
you need to make 2 with what you have.

22
00:01:35,107 --> 00:01:39,011
And the liver is the one that's going to sacrifice its energy so

23
00:01:39,011 --> 00:01:41,453
it's fine if the liver is using 6 ATP.

24
00:01:41,453 --> 00:01:47,761
As long as the muscle the greater good basically can use and make 2 ATP.

25
00:01:47,761 --> 00:01:51,762
So as long as the muscle is happy and can make some energy the liver is

26
00:01:51,762 --> 00:01:56,340
fine sacrificing, especially under anaerobic conditions.

27
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:00,052
So definitely this is an efficient cycle, definitely not,

28
00:02:00,052 --> 00:02:03,350
we're at an net loss, no one likes to be at a net loss.

29
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:09,240
And so this is not really efficient, but this is what happens,

30
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,260
Under anaerobic conditions.

31
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:17,511
[COUGH] So as mentioned, glycolysis for the activation phase first you

32
00:02:17,511 --> 00:02:23,400
use 2 ATPs and then you generate 9 ATPs, so this puts you at the net of 7 ATPs.

33
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,675
The lactate puts you at a net of 2 and if you go through the TCA cycle,

34
00:02:27,675 --> 00:02:29,940
this puts you at 3 or 2 ATPs.

35
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:33,443
And this is all you need to know.

36
00:02:33,443 --> 00:02:37,628
Also NADH, NADH molecule is 2.5 ATPs,

37
00:02:37,628 --> 00:02:43,802
everyone F A T H molecule is 1.5 and everyone GTP is 180P.

38
00:02:43,802 --> 00:02:47,711
So the oxidation we've mentioned glycolysis as occurring in the cytoplasm.

39
00:02:47,711 --> 00:02:50,810
The oxidation on the other hand, occurs in the mitochondrion.

40
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:53,490
And so this means that the pyruvate,

41
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:58,169
that's in the cytoplasm needs now to go into the mitochondria.

42
00:02:58,169 --> 00:03:02,680
And as mentioned here, it's not about to be regulated, but

43
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:07,940
mitochondrial import is rate limiting for fatty acid oxidation.

44
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:11,040
So that's important to keep in mind.

45
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,243
So the number of mitochondria can increase if you exercise more because this you're

46
00:03:15,243 --> 00:03:17,921
exercising more, which means you need more energy.

47
00:03:17,921 --> 00:03:23,087
So this kind of forces your body to adapt and make more mitochondria.

48
00:03:23,087 --> 00:03:28,768
Because the mitochondria is basically the battery of the cell and it's the only part

49
00:03:28,768 --> 00:03:34,140
that's capable of undergoing that you see a cycle and making the most energy.

50
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:39,603
So if you're exercising your body gets used to it and then it ultimately

51
00:03:39,603 --> 00:03:47,340
makes more mitochondria to be able to adapt your increased energy needs.

52
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:50,623
So the Beriberi and Wernicke Korsakoff syndrome.

53
00:03:50,623 --> 00:03:55,068
So basically if someone has vitamin B1 deficiency either because they're

54
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,647
alcoholics or due to severe deficiencies.

55
00:03:57,647 --> 00:04:00,050
And intake and by alcoholics and

56
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:05,662
electronic alcoholics then that would inhibit their vitamin B1 uptake.

57
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:12,418
And which is mentioned over here and then vitamin B1 is a co factor for PDH.

58
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:19,268
And as mentioned, PDH is necessary to transform pyruvate to acetyl CoA.

59
00:04:19,268 --> 00:04:24,468
So if vitamin B1 is sufficient then PDH activity is not really working well,

60
00:04:24,468 --> 00:04:28,553
then that means that your pyruvic cannot become Acetyl CoA.

61
00:04:28,553 --> 00:04:33,490
And if you do not have Acetyl then you do not have

62
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:37,550
your step one to go into the TCA Cycle.

63
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:40,442
So this means that you cannot go into the TCA Cycle and

64
00:04:40,442 --> 00:04:42,361
you cannot heal 30 to 80 ATPs.

65
00:04:42,361 --> 00:04:45,265
So this puts you at a disadvantage and

66
00:04:45,265 --> 00:04:50,800
the muscle if PDH activity is very low then you can't make Acetyl CoA.

67
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,192
And as mentioned earlier if you make a block away and through and

68
00:04:54,192 --> 00:04:57,274
go through the TCA Cycle and this makes the most 80 ATP.

69
00:04:57,274 --> 00:05:02,605
So if you can do that then you cannot make as much 80 ATP as your body would like.

70
00:05:02,605 --> 00:05:07,391
Which makes you probably feeling fatigued more often

71
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:11,536
just because your muscles can't really use or

72
00:05:11,536 --> 00:05:15,376
make a lot of ADP so exercise intolerance.

73
00:05:15,376 --> 00:05:16,448
You have lactic acid and

74
00:05:16,448 --> 00:05:19,241
part of it to build up because part of it can become Acetyl CoA.

75
00:05:19,241 --> 00:05:26,840
So it just gets kind of stuck as a part of it and it can become lactate as well.

76
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:30,240
I'm trying to find a picture over here that might help.

77
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,360
So here party can become l any can come lactate or

78
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:38,640
eventually Acetyl CoA over here.

79
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:44,188
So if you can't make Acetyl CoA pyruvate is forced to become lactate and

80
00:05:44,188 --> 00:05:47,614
by default you're gonna have a build up of.

81
00:05:47,614 --> 00:05:51,989
[COUGH] So how was the decision made to become lactate or Acetyl CoA so

82
00:05:51,989 --> 00:05:53,484
there is regulators.

83
00:05:53,484 --> 00:05:58,440
So NATH is equivalent to 2.5 ATP.

84
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:04,109
And Acetyl CoA which will tell you that there is enough of Acetyl CoA so

85
00:06:04,109 --> 00:06:08,507
do not make more ADH tells you there is enough energy so

86
00:06:08,507 --> 00:06:13,719
you do not need to to become Acetyl CoA and go through the cycle.

87
00:06:13,719 --> 00:06:15,296
Same thing here also.

88
00:06:15,296 --> 00:06:21,958
So those are allosteric regulators those are phosphorylate and

89
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:26,768
hence either activate or inactivate PDH and so

90
00:06:26,768 --> 00:06:32,205
basically PDH Kinase which is PDH Kinase over here.

91
00:06:32,205 --> 00:06:39,698
So PDH Kinase it adds a phosphate group to PDH Hence making it inactive PDH Phosphate

92
00:06:39,698 --> 00:06:45,640
removes a phosphate group from PDH Hence making it active.

93
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,904
This is how this works.

94
00:06:46,904 --> 00:06:53,493
So if you have a lot of ATP then you would want PDH Kinase is to be active so

95
00:06:53,493 --> 00:06:58,647
that it puts a phosphate group on PDH and inactivated.

96
00:06:58,647 --> 00:07:01,751
So this is basically your way of telling the body.

97
00:07:01,751 --> 00:07:03,326
I've got enough energy.

98
00:07:03,326 --> 00:07:08,201
I do not need PDH to be active because I do not want to make Acetyl CoA and

99
00:07:08,201 --> 00:07:10,063
go through the TCA Cycle.

100
00:07:10,063 --> 00:07:15,528
We we have enough and then if you have Acetyl CoA then it can speak for itself.

101
00:07:15,528 --> 00:07:17,228
And tell PDH kinase,

102
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:23,101
please stop pyruvate Dehydrogenase because I do not want more of myself.

103
00:07:23,101 --> 00:07:25,140
So I do not want more Acetyl CoA.

104
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:28,680
On the other hand, if you have a pyruvate build up, so

105
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:33,440
let's go back to this tiny picture over here.

106
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:33,964
Sorry?

107
00:07:33,964 --> 00:07:37,749
Okay, so if you have a pyruvate build up over here,

108
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:41,370
then this will want to go through the full cycle.

109
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:47,019
So it would increase PDH activity because PDH activity

110
00:07:47,019 --> 00:07:51,821
would eventually make it into the Acetyl CoA.

111
00:07:51,821 --> 00:07:55,545
So you want PDH to be active because pyruvate is building up and

112
00:07:55,545 --> 00:07:56,841
it has nowhere to go.

113
00:07:56,841 --> 00:08:02,070
So it wants to go downwards so downwards as in becoming Acetyl CoA calcium,

114
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:05,891
on the other hand, calcium activates PDH phosphate.

115
00:08:05,891 --> 00:08:11,099
So calcium when your muscles are moving they released calcium which means

116
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:16,561
that your muscles are moving so eventually they're gonna need more energy.

117
00:08:16,561 --> 00:08:20,339
So this is like a quick signal that hey you're moving you need energy.

118
00:08:20,339 --> 00:08:23,014
And so it activates PDH phosphate is and

119
00:08:23,014 --> 00:08:26,987
the hospitals as mentioned removes the phosphate group so

120
00:08:26,987 --> 00:08:32,595
it removes the phosphate group from PDH, nd when it does that PDH becomes active.

121
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:38,365
So basically this is your way of telling your system to kindly undergo the to

122
00:08:38,365 --> 00:08:44,242
become Acetyl CoA and hopefully undergo the TCA cycle to yield more energy.

123
00:08:44,242 --> 00:08:48,581
So those are positive in green and everything else that senses energy or

124
00:08:48,581 --> 00:08:50,331
product build up of Acetyl.

125
00:08:50,331 --> 00:08:55,914
CoA a would be negative and rent.

126
00:08:55,914 --> 00:08:59,847
So as mentioned the kinase will inactivate PDH by phosphate awaiting it.

127
00:08:59,847 --> 00:09:04,679
And the phosphate would remove the phosphate group from PDH

128
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:08,770
that the kinase has added to activate it again.

129
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:11,283
This is exactly what we're saying.

130
00:09:11,283 --> 00:09:11,971
[COUGH] And

131
00:09:11,971 --> 00:09:17,131
then what happens to Acetyl CoA it can go in different stages over here.

132
00:09:17,131 --> 00:09:20,852
So we mentioned ketone bodies under aerobic conditions.

133
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:23,471
But if you do not have oxalic acetate to react.

134
00:09:23,471 --> 00:09:24,758
So here is a oxalic acetate.

135
00:09:24,758 --> 00:09:29,261
If you do not have it to react with Acetyl CoA to go through the TCA cycle.

136
00:09:29,261 --> 00:09:30,810
Then you have ketone bodies.

137
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:33,761
That can also go into TCA cycle.

138
00:09:33,761 --> 00:09:38,221
As we've been talking I can go into fatty acid synthesis or protein.

139
00:09:38,221 --> 00:09:45,240
So here is fatty acid synthesis on this side which we'll talk about later.

140
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,286
So this is exactly what we just mentioned.

141
00:09:47,286 --> 00:09:51,440
So just keep in mind ketone bodies would be for and if you have Acetyl CoA but

142
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,741
you do not have oxalic acetate as it takes to react with it.

143
00:09:54,741 --> 00:09:57,861
So Acetyl CoA can go into the TCA cycle.

144
00:09:57,861 --> 00:10:01,895
It becomes ketones.

145
00:10:01,895 --> 00:10:03,951
So this is the simple view of the TCA cycle.

146
00:10:03,951 --> 00:10:06,363
So you have some other regulators.

147
00:10:06,363 --> 00:10:10,995
So you start with Acetyl CoA which isn't really part of the TCA cycle.

148
00:10:10,995 --> 00:10:16,765
So think of the TCA cycle as being a rout.

149
00:10:16,765 --> 00:10:22,103
Okay so, this is just a map basically or something, and

150
00:10:22,103 --> 00:10:29,728
the acetyl-CoA is the passenger that wants to go all this way, and that's it.

151
00:10:29,728 --> 00:10:31,979
So oxaloacetate would be the bus,

152
00:10:31,979 --> 00:10:36,255
the bus that would take the passenger Acetyl-CoA through town.

153
00:10:36,255 --> 00:10:40,454
So basically, Acetyl-CoA is not really part of the TCA cycle,

154
00:10:40,454 --> 00:10:42,956
it's just like the on and off switch.

155
00:10:42,956 --> 00:10:46,583
The bus will not be running unless it sees that

156
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:50,693
there is a passenger who is willing to take the bus.

157
00:10:50,693 --> 00:10:55,003
[COUGH] So this reaction as we mentioned,

158
00:10:55,003 --> 00:11:01,341
it will yield a lot of energy and per Acetyl-CoA molecule,

159
00:11:01,341 --> 00:11:09,865
the TCA cycle in the DTC will yield 10 ATPs in the form of NADH, FADH2 and GTP.

160
00:11:09,865 --> 00:11:12,468
So, those are some regulated steps over here.

161
00:11:12,468 --> 00:11:17,439
So, we didn't mention that saturate negatively signals to PFK want

162
00:11:17,439 --> 00:11:19,411
to stop making pyruvate and

163
00:11:19,411 --> 00:11:25,002
Acetyl-CoA because it doesn't want any more passengers in here on the bus.

164
00:11:25,002 --> 00:11:29,641
But also saturates some things by itself is also regulated by energy status.

165
00:11:29,641 --> 00:11:33,931
So, if you have a lot of energy then saturates and

166
00:11:33,931 --> 00:11:38,021
things will be reduced to make less saturate.

167
00:11:38,021 --> 00:11:41,692
On the other hand, if you have a lot of oxaloacetate,

168
00:11:41,692 --> 00:11:46,106
you have a lot of buses and you need energy, so you have high AMP.

169
00:11:46,106 --> 00:11:52,266
This means that saturate something needs to be active to utilize more buses and

170
00:11:52,266 --> 00:11:55,548
to make more energy through the ATCNTCA.

171
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:59,804
Same thing applies with isocitrate dehydrogenase which is like down stream of

172
00:11:59,804 --> 00:12:01,617
citrate basically in the cycle.

173
00:12:01,617 --> 00:12:05,494
Also inactivated by high energy over here and

174
00:12:05,494 --> 00:12:09,473
activated by low energy ADP, and by calcium,

175
00:12:09,473 --> 00:12:15,403
which is when the muscles are moving then you wanna make more energy.

176
00:12:15,403 --> 00:12:21,359
Alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase also downstream of those two inactivated

177
00:12:21,359 --> 00:12:29,486
by energy NADH and then activated by muscle twitching and movement.

178
00:12:29,486 --> 00:12:33,925
[COUGH] So, this is the famous bus system basically.

179
00:12:33,925 --> 00:12:38,471
So if you have more buses, this means that you can get more

180
00:12:38,471 --> 00:12:42,470
passengers to their final destination quicker.

181
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,010
So this is basically,

182
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:49,284
cuz there is anaplerotic because you're making the system more efficient.

183
00:12:49,284 --> 00:12:54,712
Cataplerosis on the other hand, would be if two of those buses are not running,

184
00:12:54,712 --> 00:12:59,734
then you took them out of the system because you want them to be in Chicago,

185
00:12:59,734 --> 00:13:02,832
for example, instead of being in an harbor.

186
00:13:02,832 --> 00:13:08,652
Then this is cataplerotic for an arbor, basically.

187
00:13:08,652 --> 00:13:13,238
If you are too cataplerotic as mentioned, you are removing the bus, so

188
00:13:13,238 --> 00:13:18,138
there's no more oxaloacetate to react with Acetyl-CoA and to deliver it.

189
00:13:18,138 --> 00:13:22,184
So basically, what's gonna happen is that this Acetyl-CoA under aerobic

190
00:13:22,184 --> 00:13:25,611
conditions as mentioned earlier, will become ketone bodies.

191
00:13:25,611 --> 00:13:28,477
And if it's not under aerobic conditions,

192
00:13:28,477 --> 00:13:33,137
that can go into other pathways depending on energy needs and what not.

193
00:13:33,137 --> 00:13:36,048
But basically, if you're to cataplerotic,

194
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:39,339
then this cycle can't really work without the bus.

195
00:13:39,339 --> 00:13:43,590
So even if you're a passenger who is waiting right there, if there is no bus

196
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:48,740
to take you anywhere, then you're just not gonna go anywhere, basically.

197
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:51,149
So, molecular basis for ketosis.

198
00:13:51,149 --> 00:13:54,157
So you can't go anywhere, but as mentioned,

199
00:13:54,157 --> 00:13:59,727
you can become ketone bodies if there's no oxaloacetate so, carbs are not present.

200
00:13:59,727 --> 00:14:02,491
And where under aerobic conditions,

201
00:14:02,491 --> 00:14:07,853
Acetyl-CoA can become ketone bodies as mentioned, which is over here.

202
00:14:07,853 --> 00:14:11,245
And definitely if you keep being cataplerotic and

203
00:14:11,245 --> 00:14:13,353
you are moving oxaloacetate.

204
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:18,397
Then you will make more ketone

205
00:14:18,397 --> 00:14:24,450
bodies which wouldn't be great for

206
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:29,695
your body basically if you have

207
00:14:29,695 --> 00:14:38,384
a build up of ketone bodies under a few conditions.

208
00:14:38,384 --> 00:14:44,458
So, [COUGH] some summary over here, so basically mitochondrial

209
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:49,752
levels really affect how much TCA cycle you can endure.

210
00:14:49,752 --> 00:14:54,054
Because more mitochondria means there is more potential to undergo

211
00:14:54,054 --> 00:14:57,611
the TCA cycle because only occurs in the mitochondria.

212
00:14:57,611 --> 00:15:00,693
Also, if you have a pyruvate in Acetyl-CoA,

213
00:15:00,693 --> 00:15:03,774
then you really can go through the TCA cycle and

214
00:15:03,774 --> 00:15:09,241
the energy levels if you have high energy then you do not really need the TCA cycle.

215
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:14,728
If you have low energy then you wanna go through the TCA cycle to make more energy.

216
00:15:14,728 --> 00:15:19,546
And also the intermediates, if there is a lot of intermediates then they can go

217
00:15:19,546 --> 00:15:24,145
through the TCA cycle, if there are no intermediate, there are no buses,

218
00:15:24,145 --> 00:15:26,705
then you can't go through the TCA cycle.

219
00:15:26,705 --> 00:15:33,089
And also calcium, calcium would activate the TCA cycle because it

220
00:15:33,089 --> 00:15:38,458
means that muscles are moving and you need more energy.

221
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:44,506
Okay, this is another quick summary that pyruvate dehydrogenase is inactivated for

222
00:15:44,506 --> 00:15:46,445
example by energy levels.

223
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:51,588
And here pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase is activated when there's a lot of energy

224
00:15:51,588 --> 00:15:56,449
which means that this kinase will add a phosphate group to PDH and inhibit it.

225
00:15:56,449 --> 00:16:01,898
Meaning that there is no more pyruvate being changed into Acetyl-CoA.

226
00:16:01,898 --> 00:16:06,940
So this is just like really a summary of regulatory steps.

227
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:11,860
So, here's the fun part that ETC Electron Transport Chain.

228
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:18,843
You've made a lot of energy and molecules from the TCA cycle over here and

229
00:16:18,843 --> 00:16:23,220
now all of this needs to go into the ETC cycle.

230
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:28,319
So, the ETC cycle should have some mechanism to be able to use the NADH and

231
00:16:28,319 --> 00:16:31,591
the FADH2 and so on, and it definitely does.

232
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:36,308
So, you have complex one that can cause the proton

233
00:16:36,308 --> 00:16:40,474
gradients over here, which is necessary.

234
00:16:40,474 --> 00:16:43,134
And then NADH can become NAD plus,

235
00:16:43,134 --> 00:16:47,923
FADH2 can give its electrons too complex too and become FAD.

236
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:52,215
And so as you're giving more of the electrons that keep propagating through

237
00:16:52,215 --> 00:16:53,966
complex three, eventually.

238
00:16:53,966 --> 00:16:59,066
And eventually too complex for and then if you have oxygen,

239
00:16:59,066 --> 00:17:04,679
the oxygen will receive that excess electrons and become H20.

240
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:08,490
So your final product really over here H20.

241
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:15,119
So as mentioned, if you're under anaerobic

242
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:22,098
status then glycolysis will be up regulated but

243
00:17:22,098 --> 00:17:27,691
the TCA cycle will be down regulated.

244
00:17:27,691 --> 00:17:33,364
So we didn't mention hypoxia and how hypoxia will cause your flux to be up

245
00:17:33,364 --> 00:17:39,705
regulated to make more energy but there's nothing going through the TCA cycle.

246
00:17:39,705 --> 00:17:40,348
And why is that?

247
00:17:40,348 --> 00:17:42,354
Why is the TCA cycle being shut?

248
00:17:42,354 --> 00:17:46,534
Although you cannot really sense oxygen,

249
00:17:46,534 --> 00:17:51,757
this is because if you don't have oxygen over here and

250
00:17:51,757 --> 00:17:54,903
this is what I'm trying to say.

251
00:17:54,903 --> 00:18:00,068
If you don't have enough oxygen then the molecules

252
00:18:00,068 --> 00:18:04,751
that are carrying a lot of energy cannot give up

253
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:08,851
their energy so that you can utilize it.

254
00:18:08,851 --> 00:18:11,340
So this would be slightly inefficient.

255
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:16,231
And basically what would happen is that you have a build up of NADH and FADH2,

256
00:18:16,231 --> 00:18:18,201
both energy dense molecules.

257
00:18:18,201 --> 00:18:20,894
So this would make your body think that,

258
00:18:20,894 --> 00:18:25,419
hey I have enough energy because I have a build up of NADH And FADH2.

259
00:18:25,419 --> 00:18:30,244
But the thing is, the build up of those two components over here,

260
00:18:30,244 --> 00:18:34,125
does not really help your body utilize this energy.

261
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:38,907
Because they're stuck over here and they can't really give

262
00:18:38,907 --> 00:18:43,415
their energy to anyone if they're just stuck over here.

263
00:18:43,415 --> 00:18:47,327
And there is no oxygen to receive the final electron.

264
00:18:47,327 --> 00:18:50,207
So what happens is, this build up of energy

265
00:18:50,207 --> 00:18:54,689
will cause basically a deactivation of pyruvate dehydrogenase.

266
00:18:54,689 --> 00:18:59,079
So you can't really make any more Acetyl-CoA from pyruvate so it can go

267
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:04,144
through the TCA cycle, it will inhibit PDH as mentioned through activating PDK.

268
00:19:04,144 --> 00:19:09,792
And it will inhibit alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase

269
00:19:09,792 --> 00:19:14,638
which which forms an intermediate and TCA cycle.

270
00:19:14,638 --> 00:19:17,239
So, you're basically shutting the whole TCA cycle off.

271
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:20,608
Here it is the alpha-ketoglutarate, so

272
00:19:20,608 --> 00:19:25,518
you're shutting the TCA cycle off by simply sensing that you

273
00:19:25,518 --> 00:19:30,450
have energy which is shown as the build up of NADH and FADH 2.

274
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:34,520
But this energy can't really go anywhere because you do not have oxygen.

275
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:38,958
This is exactly how your body shuts down the TCA cycle without even

276
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:42,111
knowing whether oxygen is truly there or not.

277
00:19:42,111 --> 00:19:46,769
It's simply by sensing the intermediates.

278
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:50,476
So, if you have some inefficient coupling and

279
00:19:50,476 --> 00:19:56,181
the electron transport chain because basically it's not efficient,

280
00:19:56,181 --> 00:19:59,328
you don't have enough oxygen or so on.

281
00:19:59,328 --> 00:20:02,560
Then this could be a good thing because you generate heat.

282
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,121
If it's just inefficient and

283
00:20:04,121 --> 00:20:08,375
you have all the build up of energy then that energy is gonna disseminate as heat.

284
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:12,723
And that is good if you're not trying to extract that energy.

285
00:20:12,723 --> 00:20:15,173
So if you really want to lose that energy,

286
00:20:15,173 --> 00:20:18,613
it's definitely a great way to lose it in the form of heat.

287
00:20:18,613 --> 00:20:23,000
That's in the case of whether someone is trying to lose weight or

288
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,793
someone is trying to warm themselves up, then it's definitely a good

289
00:20:27,793 --> 00:20:31,632
way to get rid of your energy if it gets released as heat.

290
00:20:31,632 --> 00:20:39,504
So this is when an efficiency becomes a great aspect and that's it.
