1
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:09,209
You know, in one of the rooms there. Now file in the big the big room over there in a speech do they're now piloting like

2
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:13,290
an automatic recording thing where it just records you when you start talking.

3
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:20,579
That's what I said. I was like, No, I don't like it because like, when does it know to start recording?

4
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:26,430
Like, when does it know that I am I don't like it. And I'm like, what if a student comes up afterwards and asks questions?

5
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:31,020
Is that going to be recorded? I didn't like it. I would like to know when I'm recording, I don't know.

6
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,310
But on the other hand, it would save me from myself and my inability to remember.

7
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:37,379
But I just remember it. So I c I can do it.

8
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:44,490
I don't need it. All right. So today we are going to talk about study design.

9
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:51,850
That's where I downloaded it. And. All right.

10
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:55,190
Maybe they didn't. Sorry.

11
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:01,249
Oh, here it is. It's really weird. Okay. All right.

12
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:10,309
So today we're going to be talking about. Epidemiologic study design in cancer.

13
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:16,639
So this is going to be another one of those two day lectures. And in the middle we're going to have a group exercise.

14
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:25,160
So we're going to do that at the end of class today. So if you enjoy this lecture, you may be interested in a master's in epidemiology.

15
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:31,219
That may be your thing if you're like, This is really cool stuff. If you like, Oh no, I hate this, just go ahead to medical school.

16
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:36,110
What's going to be fine? All right. So these are our objectives that are outlined.

17
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,920
So how many of you have heard about the Bradford Gill criteria for causality?

18
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:47,870
You discussed this in one or two classes. You did? Okay. So Bradford and Hill wrote this paper in 1965.

19
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:56,569
Kind of one of these criteria for determining if it's a factor that you're looking at is this is actually causing the disease of interest.

20
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:59,959
So you might find an association in a study, but is it causal?

21
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:03,200
And that's really what we always want to try to understand in epidemiology. Right.

22
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:05,990
We're doing a lot of we're going to talk about controlled,

23
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:12,049
randomized controlled trials at the end of the study design lecture, which is our experimental option, right?

24
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:14,180
Where you can assign the exposure to people.

25
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:19,940
But mostly we're doing what we call observational studies, right, where people are choosing what they do in their life.

26
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:24,650
And we're looking at people who choose this versus that or who are exposed to this versus that.

27
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:31,820
And of course, there's lots of reasons why those things could be associated with disease, but not actually the cause of disease.

28
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:40,550
Right. We're interested in causal associations. So these were the criteria that these guys outlined for inferring causation.

29
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:43,759
So the first one was strength of the association, right?

30
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:52,430
So if your relative risk for your odds ratio, your measure of association is very big, this would suggest causality rather than just an association.

31
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:57,320
Right? You get huge odds ratios of 25 to 50 for smoking of lung cancer.

32
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:06,390
Right. Most of the studies I have done, I get an odds ratio or a relative risk of like to if I'm lucky, that's pretty strong.

33
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:10,890
25 is like bonkers. It's just unheard of.

34
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:17,970
Right. So it's pretty, pretty clear that that's causal consistency in different populations.

35
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,250
If you look at lots of different groups of people and you see the same association probably

36
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:29,280
cause now there can be real reasons why you might see something different in different groups.

37
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,499
Right. So I think about there have been some studies like pharmaco genetic studies,

38
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:40,140
right, where like certain certain medicines don't work in some populations.

39
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,259
There's one example I'm thinking of that I'm going to forget the details of.

40
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:50,040
But there's some I think it's a cardiovascular medication that does not work in Asian populations very well because of a genetic background thing.

41
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:55,860
Right. That's a really that's a real thing. I would not give it to people who have that genetic background because it doesn't work the same way.

42
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:00,120
So you might this is one where you have to, like, take it with a grain of salt.

43
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:10,500
Specificity. This is another one that I think we no longer really expect when this is really useful for like infectious causes.

44
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:15,120
Right. One virus causes one disease, one bacteria causes one disease.

45
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:22,229
In this case, a lot of the risk factors for cancer are shared risk factors with other chronic diseases.

46
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:27,600
Right. So the specificity means that a particular exposure causes a particular disease.

47
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,880
But in this case, like smoking causes everything. Right.

48
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:39,130
Obesity, poor diet, lack of exercise, all kinds of things are associated with multiple different kinds of chronic disease.

49
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:44,070
So this one holds up less well in the context of cancer and other chronic diseases.

50
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:51,900
Temporality. This one is really important and this is something we're going to talk a lot about with respect to study design.

51
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:56,070
You want the exposure to precede disease, right?

52
00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:05,090
When does someone get cancer? So someone who was a doctor there diagnosed with breast cancer today.

53
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:13,970
When did they get it? If you want to look at obesity and breast cancer, when should you measure that person's BMI?

54
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:18,260
When in their life was their BMI relevant to their cancer?

55
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:26,000
Huh? Yeah, for sure. When? Before they got diagnosed today.

56
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:32,010
When did they get it? Yeah, that's.

57
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:35,260
I mean, I'm putting you on the spot, but that's because we don't actually know.

58
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:39,130
Right. You don't know when the moment was that they got cancer.

59
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:46,270
And there's different points in the natural history of cancer. Right. So there's like remember we talked about all of that.

60
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:55,989
So you. Oh, good.

61
00:05:55,990 --> 00:06:00,160
Okay. So remember we talked about life.

62
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:07,180
So you're normal. Normal, normal. Then maybe you've got, like, dysplasia, right?

63
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,420
And then maybe you've got no.

64
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:15,650
No hyperplasia. I'm sorry. And I dysplasia.

65
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:27,560
And then you've got cancer. But it's small, like stage one, and then you're going to have bigger, and then it's going to metastasize.

66
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:32,030
Right. So when you get diagnosed.

67
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:39,150
So you get diagnosed here in today, right?

68
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:46,770
Nine 2822 When did women when in here is BMI important?

69
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:52,350
Is it important for pushing you to a bigger tumor? Is it important for creating a new tumor?

70
00:06:53,430 --> 00:07:00,510
If you think it's important for creating a new tumor, or maybe you need to get your BMI back here, maybe BMI in adolescence is important.

71
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:06,930
Maybe childhood BMI is important. Maybe it's BMI two years before they were diagnosed.

72
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:12,770
That's important. This is really hard with cancer, right?

73
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:15,360
Because establishing when.

74
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:26,190
First of all, even if someone is diagnosed today, when is before is a hard question because we don't actually know like when they got that disease.

75
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:33,540
Sometimes we will lag exposures by a few years, assuming that that probably is before.

76
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:41,940
But that's an assumption. Right. And then the important window of exposure for cancer is very unclear.

77
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:50,250
A lot of cancer studies have looked at exposures in kind of adulthood or middle age and then risk of developing cancer.

78
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:58,770
But there's more and more evidence and more and more hypotheses that early life exposures or adolescent exposures might actually be really important.

79
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:03,880
And doing those studies is hard. Okay.

80
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:11,260
Biologic gradient. Is there a dose response as more of the exposure is more of the exposure associated with a higher risk?

81
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:15,060
That one kind of makes sense, right? And smoking is the perfect example of that.

82
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:20,590
We're going to talk about that in the smoking lecture. Dose is absolutely important in smoking.

83
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:26,680
The longer you smoked, the more cigarets per day, the younger you started, the later you quit.

84
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:33,009
If you quit, the worse off you are. Right? It's about kind of lifetime total exposure, plausibility.

85
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:39,550
Is there some biologic rationale for why this actually might cause the disease?

86
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:49,500
Right. This one's tough because honestly, you can almost come up with anything if you try hard enough.

87
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:56,080
You can find you can make up a story for why something is actually biologically causing you.

88
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:01,110
I promise. It's a fun it's a fun, fun exercise.

89
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:04,950
Give it a shot and then experimental evidence.

90
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:09,929
Right. You also, if you can, you want to do some kind of like experiment to try to check it out.

91
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:14,580
But you can't always write sometimes things. You can't randomize people to smoke, for example.

92
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:19,500
You can do it in animals, but you know.

93
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:24,370
It's not always possible to do randomized trials of things that people.

94
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:32,560
Okay. So these are hills criteria. Now, you said we're talking like across studies there.

95
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:37,390
In a single study, we believe something might be causal if it is not biased.

96
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:46,700
And what do we mean by not biased? We mean there's minimal confounding, limited chance variation, which you get by having a large enough sample size.

97
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:52,900
Right. This means you have the statistical power to detect your association if you have a strong association,

98
00:09:52,900 --> 00:10:00,460
dose response, temporal relationship and biologic plausibility. So some of those things for a field criteria do apply in a single study.

99
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,940
But most importantly, we need our studies not to be biased.

100
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:07,990
So what do we mean by not biased? How many I've heard of?

101
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:12,879
Confounding. Okay, so this is the distortion of a measure,

102
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:19,330
of the effect of an exposure on an outcome due to the association of the exposure with other factors that influence the outcome.

103
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:26,380
Okay. So here's our confounding triangle, the epidemiologist favorite picture.

104
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:33,010
So imagine that your exposure of interest is carrying matches and you want to look at the association with lung cancer.

105
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:39,370
Do you suppose that if you did not take anything else into account, people who carry matches in their pocket have a higher risk of lung cancer.

106
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:45,370
Probably not, because the matches have any causal association with lung cancer.

107
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:48,190
The matches in your pocket are not causing lung cancer, right?

108
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:53,650
It's the fact that people who are carrying matches are more likely to smoke and smoking causes lung cancer.

109
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:56,380
So there's actually truly no causal association here.

110
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:03,130
But if you did not take into account the smoking confounder, it could look like matches are associated with an increased risk of cancer.

111
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:10,150
You would have a biased association between matches and lung cancer if you did not take into account confounding by smoking.

112
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:21,970
This is a more realistic example. Hepatitis C virus does increase the risk of liver cancer.

113
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:31,370
But it is also commonly associated with co-infection with HPV, which also increases the risk of liver cancer.

114
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:40,580
So if you only looked at hepatitis C and liver cancer without taking into account confounding by hepatitis B,

115
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:50,390
you would see a stronger risk than really exists for hepatitis C, because you would also be kind of taking into account the Hepatitis B association.

116
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:57,920
Does that make sense? Maybe overestimating that HCV Liver Cancer Association?

117
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:06,750
All right. So if you're designing a study, how are you going to minimize confounding, you know?

118
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:13,550
Like How do you deal with confounding? What do you do about it?

119
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:20,020
Yeah. When you're doing like statistical analysis control for the compound.

120
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:20,650
That's right.

121
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:25,290
So if you were going to do that and you're designing your study and you know you've got some confounders you're gonna want to control for,

122
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:31,890
what do you need to do? So not in that.

123
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:37,700
And now that's what you would do in the analysis phase? Totally. You would stratify or you would adjust for it in a statistical model.

124
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:42,170
But if you're designing so you're starting a study, your recruiting people, you're asking them questions.

125
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:48,380
What do you do then? Yeah, that's right.

126
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,129
And especially things that you think might be potential confounders.

127
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:54,820
If you don't get good information on confounding variables, you can't adjust for them.

128
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:59,350
Like, if you only ask people, Do you smoke now? Yes or no?

129
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:06,480
You don't have great information on their smoking history. You're not going to be able to thoroughly adjust for that potential.

130
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:10,270
Right. You want to ask, do you smoke now? Yes or no?

131
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:13,840
Did you smoke in the past? When did you start? When did you quit?

132
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:16,479
On average? How many cigarets did you smoke per day? Right.

133
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:22,600
You want all of that information so that you can get a good, detailed confounder to adjust for.

134
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:28,739
Right. So you want to ask lots of the things that you think are important confounders.

135
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:37,500
You need to ask lots of questions and make sure you get good information. There's also ways when you're doing a case control study, you can match.

136
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:43,290
And that also takes care of confounding at the design phase. We're not going to go into a lot of detail about that.

137
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:49,430
All right. Another main type of bias we talked about confounding bias.

138
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,280
Now we're going to talk about information, bias or misclassification. Those are the same thing.

139
00:13:54,420 --> 00:14:01,890
So misclassification is erroneous classification of an individual evaluation attribute into a category other than that to which it should be assigned.

140
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:05,460
Okay. You got the wrong information from people.

141
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:10,710
Your lab measured, cholesterol wrong.

142
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:20,100
Everybody's higher than they should be. Or the person who is measuring blood pressure like to turn around to the nearest five.

143
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:32,250
And so you got the wrong answers that people were not honest with you about something that was sensitive.

144
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:35,460
Right. Maybe sexual history or drug use.

145
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:41,100
Right. I told you. No, no, I don't do that. But they do. So you've got them in the know drug use then?

146
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:44,550
Like really they should have been in the drug use here, right.

147
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:49,920
Number of sexual partners. Like two.

148
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:54,420
Right. But it should be more than that because they're not being honest with you about sensitive information.

149
00:14:55,050 --> 00:15:00,300
Okay. That's an example. Or they just can't remember very well.

150
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:03,710
And we're going to talk about this with. Right.

151
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:08,310
People are probably remembering their diet. Tell me what you eat for breakfast yesterday.

152
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:18,330
How much? What size? Server. Do you have any snacks?

153
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:28,520
How about a week ago? Like on the weekend? Would you eat on the weekend? Yeah, right.

154
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:35,900
People are terrible at this and they're terrible at telling you accurately how much because people are really bad at knowing what a serving is.

155
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:42,200
Has anyone ever actually. Many of you have, I'm sure, measured out a serving of ice cream and put it in your bowl.

156
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:51,360
Is it sad? It's sad, isn't it? An actual serving, like based on what's on the cartons, a serving of ice cream.

157
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,940
And you're like, no, that's not any ice cream at all.

158
00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:03,040
I need a smaller goal or more. Right. So people are really bad for a lot of things at telling you what a serving is.

159
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,780
Right. And it's not that they're lying. They're just bad at remembering it.

160
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:13,360
Right. Okay. So these are all kinds of ways you can get misclassification.

161
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:18,850
If it's non differential, the bias will be toward the non non differential means.

162
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:25,960
Like if you're talking about exposure, misclassification, the ease of diet, if you expect the exposure misclassification to be equal,

163
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:30,370
the same kind of misclassification in people with and without your disease.

164
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:35,230
It will just find for officers mixing people up. So you can't really tell the difference.

165
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:40,120
Right. But if you think it's different by disease group.

166
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:44,320
The degree of an assassination is different by disease.

167
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:54,910
Like, for example, you are interviewing parents who had a child die of since sudden infant death syndrome.

168
00:16:55,270 --> 00:17:01,480
Their baby died. You are interviewing people after the fact and asking them questions about what they did during pregnancy.

169
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:06,580
Can you imagine that the mothers of children who died would try very,

170
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:14,110
very hard to remember every single thing and maybe remember more accurately than the mothers of infants who did not.

171
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:21,490
Right. Or if they kind of know what you're getting at.

172
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:29,110
Like if you're looking at STDs and risk of something else like cancer, STDs and cancer, say STDs and prostate cancer,

173
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:34,710
you're asking people have their history if they know or have some inkling that, you know,

174
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:42,280
there is a relationship and they feel like some sort of guilt about maybe I gave this cancer to myself.

175
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:47,229
It could go either way. You can imagine that people would be very honest and try really hard to tell you everything.

176
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:52,080
Or you can imagine that they would kind of try to hide that exposure from you. And it might be different mechanisms.

177
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:55,450
Right? So there's all kinds of ways that this can go awry.

178
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:01,639
And be differential. And in that case, it can go in any direction.

179
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:08,210
And it's very difficult to imagine or to predict what kind of bias you're getting.

180
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:12,800
So non differential is sort of easier to deal with because you're like, well, we found something.

181
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:19,610
It might actually be stronger than what we found because we expect that there's some misclassification here, but it's not differential.

182
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:26,870
Does that make sense? OC recall bias is a type of information bias.

183
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:32,220
This is a systematic error due to differences in accuracy or completeness of recall to memory of past events or experiences.

184
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:40,840
So. Like we said, this is recall bias is when the recall is different between cases and controls

185
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:45,100
or when recall of like illness is different between exposed and not exposed.

186
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:52,510
Right. When people are remembering things differently based on case or exposure status.

187
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:58,470
Yeah. Yes. So like we were talking about, like the breakfast thing.

188
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:04,440
That's okay. So is that all?

189
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:13,230
If you think that remembering what you had for breath, if your exposure is what you had for breakfast and you're interested in disease.

190
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:20,220
If you think remembering what you had for breakfast is going to be differently bad in people with and without the disease,

191
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:24,809
then it could be recall bias. If you just think everybody, regardless of disease status,

192
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:29,010
is bad at remembering what they had for breakfast kind of equally then it's just poor recall

193
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:33,720
and that will bias towards the non recall bias is when that would be different by case status.

194
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:40,680
You might imagine it it like if you're disease is Alzheimer's right it's a memory disease.

195
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:44,700
Sure. Recall is going to be different by cases and controls.

196
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:51,730
Yeah. Right.

197
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:57,010
So let's talk about whether this is this is exactly what you just said.

198
00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:00,100
Is this recall bias or is this non differential misclassification?

199
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:07,120
So example one Individuals with cancer are more likely to remember having had an x ray in the past compared with people without cancer.

200
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,830
Your exposure is X-rays. Lifetime number of X-rays. Your outcome is cancer.

201
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:22,280
We think. To be recalled.

202
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:31,679
Recall bias, right? Because the remembering is the way they're remembering their exposure is different in the cases.

203
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:38,890
In their cases. That's correct. That's recall bias. Example two people have a hard time accurately completing food frequency questionnaire.

204
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:45,680
So measures of diet are often for. That would be non differential misclassification.

205
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:47,940
Right. Just that recall. Right.

206
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:59,010
This is confusing because I mean, this is something that even like people on their p comprehensive exam will struggle to do to determine.

207
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,110
So this is a confusing concept. I'm kind of introducing you to it.

208
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:08,460
Understand that everybody struggles with this to some degree in epidemiology.

209
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,540
Right. It seems really, really easy with these examples.

210
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:14,720
And then you get further into an actual study. They're like, Oh, I don't know.

211
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:23,390
So it's a it's a difficult concept. So how would you minimize recall bias or misclassification when you're designing a study?

212
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:40,920
One way is to get non self-reported stop. Look, if you can get some sort of objective measure from before they have the disease, that'll be great.

213
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:47,220
Or if you can ask them about their exposures before they have disease, which is a prospective kind of design.

214
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:56,610
Then ask for it to write. That minimizes bias misclassification.

215
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:02,010
You just want to be really careful about how you ask questions and you want to make sure you do it all the same,

216
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:09,540
especially if you're asking after people have become cases. You have to do it all the same in cases and controls, right?

217
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,959
Imagine you want to do a case control study. You had met cancer head and neck.

218
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,890
Cancer patients come from all over the state of Michigan to be treated at the University Initiative Hospital.

219
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:22,260
So they're sitting here getting treated and you're asking them in person questions for your question.

220
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:27,600
And then it sounds really hard. You're going to do community controls, right?

221
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,140
You're going to find a control, someone without cancer who lives in their neighborhood,

222
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:35,429
but they live all the way in the U.P., so it's like really hard to get there.

223
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:44,870
So instead you just do a phone interview with the people who are your controls. Found out that in-person interviews and phone interviews.

224
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:46,930
Well, sometimes you'll different answers, right?

225
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:54,560
You have now asked your questions differently in your cases and your controls and potentially introduced differential misclassification.

226
00:22:55,790 --> 00:23:01,269
Right. So if you were going to do that, if you weren't going to go travel to Europe to ask the questions of controls,

227
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:04,980
you should wait till your cases, get home and call them on the phone and ask them the questions.

228
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:09,700
Right, so that you're doing it the same when we do laboratory measures.

229
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:16,150
We mixed the cases and controls in each batch. You never do a batch of cases and then batch controls,

230
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:24,280
because if there's batch differences now you've introduced differential misclassification of your lab outcome by measuring them separately.

231
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:29,810
Yeah. Okay.

232
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:36,829
Selection bias. This is bias and the estimated association of effect of an exposure on an outcome that

233
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:41,240
arises from the procedures used to select individuals into the study or analysis.

234
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:51,499
Okay, so this sounds difficult, but essentially we're going to talk in more detail about this today in the group exercise.

235
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:56,750
But if you pick people incorrectly for your study, you're going to have a problem.

236
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:02,810
This often arises with case control studies. You pick your cases, you get your cases of cancer from a hospital.

237
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:12,110
Now you've got to get controls for them. Ideally your controls are from the same population that gave rise to the cases.

238
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:18,230
Who is that? You've got cancer cases coming to the University of Michigan.

239
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:25,980
Who are the right controls for those people? Probably not people in Ann Arbor.

240
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:31,950
You. Why are they there, though?

241
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:41,690
What would you bet? Are you going to go to the cardiovascular center? Are you going to go to the E.R.?

242
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:55,590
It's really hard. This is really hard. It's really hard to do.

243
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:58,980
If you went to the cardiovascular center, you're like, okay, we've got cancer cases now.

244
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:02,040
I'm going to go to the cardiovascular center and my exposure to smoking.

245
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:09,180
Now you've got controls whose level of smoking is probably higher than the general population.

246
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:09,480
Right?

247
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:19,709
So you have a different your your your distribution of exposure is different in your controls than it is in the source population for your cases.

248
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:23,540
Now you've created a selection bias. Does that make sense?

249
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:26,810
It's tough.

250
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:35,460
It's really hard to do, which is why doing if you can do a prospective study, it's better because getting the right controls is really, really hard.

251
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:40,710
Often what we would do is you might go back to people who live in their neighborhood.

252
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:48,729
But maybe then you're getting something weird, right? Because the people who are able to travel might be higher SARS than the people

253
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:52,240
who live in their neighborhood who couldn't travel to University of Michigan.

254
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,980
Right. It's hard it's very hard to know if you're getting the right people and hard.

255
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:03,320
All right. Selection bias is different than generalizability.

256
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:08,480
This is another big, confusing topic that will often confuse even Ph.D. students.

257
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:14,149
Generalizability is the degree to which the results of a study may apply or be

258
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:18,020
generalized to populations or groups that didn't participate in the study.

259
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:24,980
It is not necessarily selection bias if you are getting the right answer for the people in your study,

260
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:32,710
but the people in your study are different than the general population. That is generalizability problem, not a selection bias problem.

261
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,600
If you were giving the wrong answer about your exposure disease relationship

262
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:40,010
for the people in your study because of how you pick people for your study,

263
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:49,670
that is the selection bias problem. Let's talk about the health professional follow up study that is a prospective cohort run by Harvard.

264
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:56,690
It is like 94% white. It is all men and they are all graduate level health professionals.

265
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:03,700
Are they are are the results of the study correct?

266
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:08,410
They're looking at cigaret smoking among parents. Are they finding the right answer?

267
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:16,160
Four highly educated white dudes. Yes. Is that answer.

268
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:21,590
So that is not a selection bias problem. They do have however you select population.

269
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:29,060
Do you think that the results of that study would necessarily be generalizable to black women?

270
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:39,010
Maybe not. Very easy to say no, because it certainly is a group that is not in there.

271
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:41,739
But you have to ask yourself, if your question is smoking and lung cancer,

272
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:45,460
do you think smoking lung cancer smoking still causes lung cancer in black women?

273
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:53,320
Probably for that study, those results would be generalizable because smoking is bad for people and black women are people.

274
00:27:53,320 --> 00:28:00,340
Right. But there are certainly things where the results would not be generalizable.

275
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:08,390
Right. And you have to be very thoughtful about that. So that is a generalizability versus a selection bias issue.

276
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:15,740
They're getting the correct answer for their study population. Whether that answer is generalizable to other people is up for debate.

277
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:20,480
Yeah. Okay.

278
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:29,420
So let's talk now about study types. We've got experimental and observational studies.

279
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:33,150
The experimental study is in people is a randomized controlled trial.

280
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:36,810
The observational studies, there's multiple different kinds.

281
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:44,700
There's individual based where you get information about individual people, cohort, case control and cross-sectional studies are those types.

282
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:51,390
And then there's also ecological studies which are population based. And we're going to go through these today or some of them today and Tuesday.

283
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:57,960
Okay. So the hierarchy of evidence, so you will probably see this a lot of we seen something like this before.

284
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:06,959
The idea is that kind of ecologic studies are the evidence from an ecological study is considered less strong than that.

285
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,010
From that experimental study,

286
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:17,360
I hope to show you that this hierarchy is about the possibility of bias and whether or not you are finding the correct answer,

287
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:26,110
the correct unbiased exposure disease relationship. You can still screw up a trial and get the wrong answer.

288
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:30,670
Just because it's a trial doesn't mean that it's better than an observational study.

289
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:42,250
And we'll talk about what I mean by that in a little bit. Right. The probability of bias due to confounding information bias is is still lower.

290
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,360
But you have to think about the actual research questions that you're asking.

291
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:50,470
And we'll talk about what I mean and a little bit. Okay.

292
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:54,610
So let's start at the bottom. Ecological studies for this before.

293
00:29:56,050 --> 00:30:01,180
All right. So the unit of observation here is the population or the community, not people.

294
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:08,920
You're looking at the frequency of the disease in relation to exposure in populations, different populations, or in the same population over time.

295
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:15,050
It's a first step. It's quick and inexpensive. It may suggest hypotheses, but it does not test them.

296
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:23,200
All right. So you might get data from surveillance systems, routine data that's collected for other reasons.

297
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:28,390
Keep in mind that the exposure levels that you're getting represent the average for

298
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:32,379
each population and the groups are populations are defined according to whatever,

299
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:36,880
like place of residence, place of birth, socioeconomic status, occupation.

300
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:43,120
So here are some examples. You might compare different populations. You might study one population over time.

301
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,970
Migration studies are a good example of this.

302
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:53,410
You might compare people who live in the country of origin to people who immigrated here as adults, to people who were born here as first generation.

303
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:59,920
Right. And you might also be looking if you're comparing different populations over time,

304
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:04,150
you could maybe investigate the effective methods, effectiveness of health programs or interventions.

305
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:09,160
Looking at different health outcomes before and after the implementation of

306
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:12,220
the Affordable Care Act is something that people have done in this country. Right.

307
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:20,770
Comparing populations before and after comparing anybody know about like folate,

308
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:26,049
the neural tube defects for ladies in a vitamin that prevents neural tube defects.

309
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:31,570
If you had enough of it early in pregnancy, if you're if you're deficient early in pregnancy, you can get things like that, for example.

310
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:37,180
And the trouble is you need to be taking it in like the first six weeks of pregnancy.

311
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:40,329
So if you're planning to get pregnant, you can take prenatal vitamins that have plenty of this.

312
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:46,180
But like a lot of pregnancies are not planned. Right. And women don't know that they're pregnant until well after that six week mark.

313
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:52,000
So they can't take the prenatal vitamins, which is why we now fortify our grain in this country with fully.

314
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:56,980
So you can actually look at neural tube defect rates before and after fortification and see that it worked.

315
00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:03,129
Dental caries before and after putting fluoride in the water. Right.

316
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:11,800
Those are examples of economic studies. Here's one correlation between per capita meat consumption and incidence of colon cancer.

317
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:19,320
The and New Zealand. Yes. We eat a lot of meat. So this isn't meat.

318
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:24,630
Per capita daily meat consumption in grams and colon cancer incidence in women.

319
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:35,010
So what does it look like to you here? It looks like eating more meat causes colon cancer, right?

320
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:40,820
Well, we got some vegans in the U.S., right? Not everybody.

321
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:44,080
This is the average, right? This is people who are eating tons of meat.

322
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:47,380
People are making some meat. Vegans. Right. All kind of mixed together.

323
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:52,530
This is our average colon cancer incidence. Do we know that the people who are eating the meat are the ones who are getting the colon cancer?

324
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:59,550
No, that's the trouble with the logic. Stanton So this is interesting, but you would have to follow it up with individual data.

325
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:05,460
Here we go. Solar radiation and breast cancer mortality rates.

326
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:11,580
So this is suggesting that the higher solar radiation a place gets, the lower the breast cancer rates.

327
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:14,730
What do you think that they're getting at with this solar radiation measure?

328
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:20,460
What is the proxy for? Anybody know?

329
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:28,680
People use this a lot as a proxy for vitamin D and vitamin D is made by sun exposure.

330
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:35,190
Now. People live in Phenix, so they all get sun exposure all day.

331
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:38,370
What about people who just stay inside? Like it is too hot here.

332
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:45,560
I'm in the air conditioning. If you go outside, I only go out on a cloud of dust.

333
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:50,719
All right. You got a mix of people in there who are just because you live in a place that

334
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:54,410
gets a lot of sun doesn't mean you personally are getting sun on your skin.

335
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:58,190
You might be a person who always wears long sleeves. You might be a person who wears a lot of sunscreen.

336
00:33:58,310 --> 00:34:04,490
Might just not go outside because you don't like bugs, you know? So, again, interesting.

337
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:11,309
But not. Definitive. Here's a migration study migration on the incidence of breast cancer.

338
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:15,150
So this is people who live in Japan. This is the breast cancer rate in women in Japan.

339
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:18,660
This is the breast cancer rate in people who immigrated to the U.S. late in life,

340
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:23,610
people who immigrated early in life, and people who were of Japanese descent born in the U.S.

341
00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:30,749
So this is interesting suggesting that it's not genetic but rather environmental factors,

342
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:36,030
because you would imagine that people who kind of if you're if you immigrate late,

343
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:43,020
you probably retain more cultural and dietary and whatever factors of your homeland if you immigrate early,

344
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:53,670
maybe more so than people who are born here. Right. So this is suggesting that there are environmental cultural things about the U.S. that are

345
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:59,820
different from Japan rather than any genetic difference between people born of Japanese descent.

346
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:07,030
That makes sense. I'm going to skip this.

347
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:12,110
So ecologic studies are advantageous. You don't have to have contact with the study subjects.

348
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:15,139
It's pretty easy. You just get some data that's already there.

349
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:21,230
Basically to do your study, you don't have to like collect data, so there's no cost.

350
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:29,390
It actually may provide a wide range of exposure levels, right? Like that international study we looked at, you've got.

351
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:35,000
You know, you've got the U.S. and New Zealand and Japan and Nigeria.

352
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:39,360
You've got all these different studies that have this very wide range of per capita daily meat consumption.

353
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:42,480
If you were to follow this up with an individual level study in the U.S.,

354
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:49,980
you might get like the majority of your participants might have a range in here right around this average.

355
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:56,520
You're not going to have a lot of people to compare very low to very high levels of meat consumption.

356
00:35:57,150 --> 00:36:02,940
So it's actually can be really useful to look at a full range of exposure in a, you know, in an ecological study.

357
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:11,820
So that can be an advantage. It's pretty practical, especially if exposure is relatively homogenous in a population.

358
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:16,620
So things like air pollution, they might be difficult to measure on an individual basis,

359
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:22,230
but probably most people in that area are exposed in a fairly homogeneous way to whatever area is in that area.

360
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:26,410
Right. Okay.

361
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:34,150
Uh. Yeah. So these are some of the advantages we've already discussed.

362
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:39,550
The number of variables on which data are available is limited. So these are disadvantages, right?

363
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:44,620
So like for example, you might not know that in that colon cancer study you were looking at something,

364
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:51,190
but you weren't able to adjust for things like screening practices in the country for smoking.

365
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:57,639
Right. So you can't adjust for a lot of confounders. You don't know if the measurements were taken.

366
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:00,850
Well, you might have measurement error and you would have no idea because you didn't take the measurement.

367
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:06,879
Somebody else did. And it's usually kind of difficult to incorporate an appropriate time lag period.

368
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:16,150
So for example, like you're looking at per capita meat consumption now probably and colon cancer rates now, right?

369
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:22,400
Like if per capita meat consumption has actually changed over time, that might be meat consumption from 30 years ago.

370
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,260
That is more relevant to colorectal cancer now. Right.

371
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:32,830
But usually in these economic studies, it's sort of cross-sectional and the exposure and the outcome was measured from kind of the same time period.

372
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:36,120
Does that make sense? So it's a little confusing.

373
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,569
All right. And so this is what we said,

374
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:46,389
that the ecologic fallacy is that we may be ascribing to members of a group characteristics states that do not possess this individual.

375
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:54,010
So the vegans got thrown into that US group, right. With the per capita consumption and they're not eating meat and the vegetarians.

376
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:59,340
In the past. All right.

377
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:02,580
So moving up now, we're going to talk about case control studies.

378
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:08,760
This is a comparative study where people with the disease of interest are compared with people without the disease.

379
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:17,510
So you might get cases from population registries like here, you can get cases from the Seer registry and then find controls to compare them to.

380
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:22,760
You can get cases from hospitals, for example.

381
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:27,680
There's also a way to do this within a cohort study that we'll talk about later.

382
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:34,940
So this is a picture of like this is the time, the past and the future, and you're right now.

383
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:40,340
So you've got kind of a snapshot of right now. You're going to get people who right now have your disease.

384
00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:42,620
In this case, we're talking about coronary heart disease.

385
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:50,120
And then from the people who don't have your disease right now, at the same time, you're going to pick your controls.

386
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:53,360
So some of these non disease people are picked as controls.

387
00:38:54,680 --> 00:39:02,200
And then you're going to ask everybody about past exposures, right? I'm going to try to assess what they have previously been exposed to.

388
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:09,430
An example of this is the New England bladder study.

389
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:19,450
So they got newly diagnosed histologically confirmed cases of urinary bladder cancer aged 30 to 79 from Maine, Vermont and New Hampshire.

390
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:26,380
They got cases from hospital pathology departments, hospital cancer registries and state cancer registries from those three states.

391
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:36,650
Then they got controls. Those they for the people 30 to 64, they found controls from DMV.

392
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:42,570
And for people 65 to 79, they got controls from Medicare.

393
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:49,740
Because older people may not drive anymore. Right. Especially if they're sick.

394
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:53,610
So it's a less reliable way of getting control.

395
00:39:54,390 --> 00:40:00,690
So this is pretty good, right? You're missing potentially controls who don't drive by going through the DMV.

396
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:09,140
But most adults will have a driver's license or a state I.D. card.

397
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:20,910
So it's a reasonable way of doing it, right? Then they asked about food intake over the past five years with a food frequency questionnaire.

398
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:29,910
In both cases Gulf. And then they estimated the odds ratios.

399
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:33,840
Okay. So now this is the this is the timeline.

400
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:37,950
Again, you've got the disease now disease status is known now.

401
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:41,999
And you're asking about what happened in the past. I don't know about diet, really,

402
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:48,090
in the past five years being that different in case of a controlled or being remembered that differently in cases controls.

403
00:40:48,090 --> 00:40:53,670
But there are certainly things you can imagine the cases in controls might remember differently at this point.

404
00:40:55,850 --> 00:41:05,209
Now a nested case control study is where you've got a cohort that we're going to talk about next time you've got a population,

405
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:08,720
you've collected the baseline data, you follow them over time.

406
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:13,760
Some develop disease and some don't. So what you're going to do is you're going to take your cases.

407
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:23,120
And from those that don't develop disease, you're going to pick your controls within your cohort.

408
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:26,840
This takes care of a lot of methodological issues.

409
00:41:27,650 --> 00:41:30,680
You have collected data before anybody became a case.

410
00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:37,680
You do not have recall bias because you are not asking people who already have the disease about their past exposures.

411
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:42,170
So people answered your questions when they didn't know if they were a case where a control.

412
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:45,840
So it's very difficult to imagine that they would have answered differently based on case.

413
00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:52,700
Right. You also are not trying to pick controls for a group of cases.

414
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:57,860
Your base population from which your cases of controls arose is defined.

415
00:41:57,860 --> 00:42:01,820
It is your cohort. So you do not have a selection. Bias is you picking your controls?

416
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:05,880
So we've already taken care of recall bias and selection bias.

417
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:12,690
If you have any misclassification, it's going to be non differential because you asked before they ever became cases.

418
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:22,750
Right so cohorts solve a lot of these issues and doing case control studies nested within cohorts solve a lot of these issues.

419
00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:27,750
You might ask, why would you ever bother doing an absolute case control study?

420
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:36,130
Well, let's look at this example from my work. We have 29,133 people from southwestern Finland recruited in the eighties.

421
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:40,750
They collected fasting serum samples at baseline part of the freezer.

422
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:46,240
Later on I came along and I said, Hey, I want to look at thyroid hormones and risk of prostate cancer.

423
00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:54,160
So I picked I took the samples out of the freezer and measured these hormones tt4 and TVG.

424
00:42:55,330 --> 00:43:01,090
So we took 402 of the prostate cancer cases diagnosed at least three years after baseline.

425
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:08,889
The reason we did that is because if we took your blood when you were enrolled, you said, Nope, I don't have prostate cancer.

426
00:43:08,890 --> 00:43:12,130
And the next day you went to the doctor. I mean, I had prostate cancer.

427
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:16,750
Do you think there might be things in your blood that are different from people who truly don't have it?

428
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:25,000
Probably the cancer could be causing changes in your hormones rather than your hormones causing anything to do with cancer.

429
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:29,140
So we picked three years as a reasonable buffer.

430
00:43:30,690 --> 00:43:35,309
Yes. Right. We didn't know. I don't have any medical knowledge of prostate cancer biology.

431
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:41,400
That three years is the magic number. But it was. We could exclude the first three years of follow up and still have enough cases to pick from.

432
00:43:41,970 --> 00:43:45,660
And it seemed like a decent number. Right. So that's what we did.

433
00:43:46,950 --> 00:43:53,550
Then we picked controls to per case from the people who were cancer free at the time the case was diagnosed.

434
00:43:54,900 --> 00:44:02,520
And we pulled those people, those 402 cases and the 804 controls out of the freezer and measured their hormones.

435
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:08,600
Do you know how expensive it is to measure a thyroid hormone in one sample?

436
00:44:08,610 --> 00:44:12,510
One hormone? One sample? Eight bucks.

437
00:44:15,150 --> 00:44:18,510
Three hormones means each person costs 24 bucks.

438
00:44:18,810 --> 00:44:24,220
Somebody multiply 24 times 21,133 for me real quick here.

439
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:41,050
24 times 29,134. 700,000 bucks to measure hormones in a whole cohort.

440
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:46,330
So if you took the blood samples out of freezer measure, then everybody would cost you $700,000.

441
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:52,570
No one is going to give you $700,000 to do that. Never mind the fact that you're wasting a lot of blood samples you don't need to spend.

442
00:44:52,930 --> 00:44:56,770
That's a finite resource. You took a few miles from these people and put them in the freezer.

443
00:44:56,770 --> 00:45:03,280
That is all you have. Anything you want to study in these people for the rest of time has to come out of the blood samples that you took.

444
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:07,120
So you don't want to just be spending them for nothing.

445
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:11,920
So that's why we do nested case control studies rather than just measuring things on the whole cohort.

446
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:16,450
It's cheaper and we don't spend all of our blood. Okay.

447
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:23,680
So this is the same thing we just said. So in cases, you need a precise criteria for case definition.

448
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:33,310
You want objective evidence of disease, you want newly diagnosed cases usually, and you want this to represent all cases of the disease of interest.

449
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:40,360
This is really important that newly diagnosed. Can you guys think of a cancer that tends to be really fatal?

450
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:45,110
Yeah. Pancreatic cancer. Absolutely.

451
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:51,379
So let's say you go out and you're like, okay, I want to do a case control study of pancreatic cancer and you go to see her and you're like,

452
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:54,610
I'm just going to take anybody who's alive right now and can answer my questionnaire.

453
00:45:56,730 --> 00:46:01,020
You are probably going to get people who have lived for multiple years with their pancreatic cancer.

454
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:06,780
Right. Because the people who are alive right now include a mix of newly diagnosed, but also people who are survivors.

455
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:11,970
Do you think the survivors are kind of different than most people who have pancreatic cancer?

456
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:19,139
Probably, right, because most people don't live multiple years, five, ten years after pancreatic cancer.

457
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:22,410
So that's why you really want to make sure you're going to incident cases,

458
00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:27,330
particularly for these thing, because long term survivors might actually be different.

459
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:30,240
In fact, people are studying long term survivors. Right.

460
00:46:30,810 --> 00:46:36,540
There's a whole group of people who are like, what's up with these people who lived with ovarian cancer for like 20 years?

461
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:44,070
How are they different? Right. So you don't want to you don't want to do that if you're looking at incidence.

462
00:46:44,070 --> 00:46:48,090
You don't want to mix long term survivors in with your new cases because they might be very different.

463
00:46:49,950 --> 00:46:57,540
Okay for controls. You want them to have the same eligibility criteria of the cases except for the disease.

464
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:03,900
There's lots of ways to get controls neighborhoods, relatives, friends, hospitals.

465
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:11,040
I will tell you right now, hospitals are very frowned upon for the reasons that I that I outlined.

466
00:47:11,070 --> 00:47:13,710
Often people will go to the hospital for a reason. Right.

467
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:22,140
So it's really hard to pick good controls from people at the hospital as a particular type of selection based on Ferguson's bias.

468
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:26,750
If you propose a hospital controlled study, everybody is going to go that.

469
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:30,450
No. Can't do that. I'm going to get biased. It's just kind of a well-known thing at this point.

470
00:47:32,490 --> 00:47:37,530
And that's the case. Control studies are kind of the best. They minimize a lot of these potential sources of bias, but you can't always do that.

471
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:46,090
Okay. So the measure of association, a case control study was the odds ratio because remember this, you know,

472
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:53,370
if you have your two by two table where disease and no disease or your columns and exposed and unexposed are your rows set up in this way,

473
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:59,489
the formula is eight times D over B times C like most relative measures of association,

474
00:47:59,490 --> 00:48:03,270
if it equals one, that means there is no association between exposure and disease.

475
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:08,460
If it is greater than one, it means you are is associated with an increased risk of the disease.

476
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:13,200
And if it is less than one, it means the exposure is associated with a decreased risk of the disease.

477
00:48:14,450 --> 00:48:19,790
Right. So why do we bother with case control studies?

478
00:48:19,810 --> 00:48:27,420
They're efficient in time and cost. And you can investigate a wide range of possible risk factors.

479
00:48:27,450 --> 00:48:30,860
You can ask people about all kinds of different things once you've found your cases and your controls.

480
00:48:30,870 --> 00:48:38,490
And it's particularly suitable for investigating rare diseases, for diseases with a long incubation period, which means they're ideal for cancer.

481
00:48:38,850 --> 00:48:44,130
If you're going to start a cancer cohort today, even if you are recruiting people who are in their fifties,

482
00:48:45,030 --> 00:48:48,840
you are going to wait 20 years before you have enough cases to actually look at cancer.

483
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:54,830
Cancer cohort studies are and you have this fairly rare disease.

484
00:48:54,850 --> 00:49:02,790
So when you recruit cancer cohorts, you're recruiting tens of thousands of people, at least in order to get enough cases to study them.

485
00:49:02,790 --> 00:49:10,560
Eventually you have to have a large population in order to get enough cases of a fairly rare outcome to study it.

486
00:49:12,170 --> 00:49:17,479
Okay. Cancer cohort studies are huge. They're expensive and they take a really long time.

487
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:24,740
So if you want to study a cancer, particularly a rare cancer right now, you're going to do a case control study because you can get your cancer.

488
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:30,380
You cases have already happened. You're collecting of all the cases you can find and then you're finding people to compare them to.

489
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:37,590
So that's why people bother with it, right? Even though I've told you all of the ways that it's less.

490
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:40,470
Less good than a cohort. Right? That's why we do it.

491
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:48,120
But I will tell you, there are a lot of cancer cohorts out there now and a lot of cohorts even for rare cancers,

492
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:50,790
even if a single cohort can't look at a rare cancer by itself.

493
00:49:51,390 --> 00:49:55,560
We put together these consortia where they kind of pooled their data to look at the rare cancers together.

494
00:49:56,100 --> 00:50:02,729
So a lot of cancers, like if you propose a brand new case control study for a cancer, a lot of times people are going to know there's no point.

495
00:50:02,730 --> 00:50:08,430
We've already got cohorts. Right. There has to be something different about your your case control study for people who want to do it.

496
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:17,330
Okay. So it's really hard to get the right controls which can lead to selection bias.

497
00:50:18,170 --> 00:50:23,770
Getting people to remember their past exposures can be hard and making sure that you're getting it correctly.

498
00:50:23,780 --> 00:50:27,050
Equally, in the cases and controls, you can introduce recall bias.

499
00:50:28,850 --> 00:50:34,909
If you measure your exposure at the time of diagnosis, it might not be accurate, which could be reverse causation.

500
00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:41,600
So maybe the last example, if you're measuring, if you have blood samples from somebody who's got cancer and somebody who doesn't.

501
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:44,410
You would expect a lot of things to be different in those, right?

502
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:49,400
If you really wanted to look at a blood marker and risk of cancer, you would have wanted to measure it before the people were sick.

503
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:52,310
Let's think about physical activity.

504
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:57,030
If you take cancer patients and ask them about their physical activity, they're going to say, I'm not doing a fantastic.

505
00:50:58,450 --> 00:51:03,130
Right. You want to know what it was like to be 14?

506
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:09,939
So you have to be careful that you're not asking the questions or measuring things in a way that you're getting things that have

507
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:18,040
changed because the cases are sick and these are all usually mitigated or eliminated if you use the nested case control design.

508
00:51:19,590 --> 00:51:27,920
Okay. So now we're going to get in our groups and we're going to talk about one of the articles that you read, find that man at all.

509
00:51:29,060 --> 00:51:32,719
And the questions are in a word document in the assignment as well.

510
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:36,080
So you can download them and put them into a Google doc and share them with your group.

511
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:42,080
But these are the questions that you're going to work through with your group. So probably we'll see how quickly you guys go.

512
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:45,680
I imagine we're going to do the questions this time to discuss the answers next time.

513
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:57,460
But we might get to discussing them as. And I am going to turn on the TV.

514
00:52:03,710 --> 00:52:15,420
Who? So remember, these are the in-class groups.

515
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:33,390
The first ones. Yes. I know.

516
00:52:58,070 --> 00:53:15,350
Something. You.

517
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:30,690
I was getting nervous, which is.

518
00:53:48,260 --> 00:54:07,650
She was. I got.

519
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:38,690
Yeah. Yeah.

520
00:55:01,890 --> 00:55:55,390
I. But.

521
00:55:58,390 --> 01:00:10,630
You can't play here. There's got to be.

522
01:00:41,610 --> 01:01:03,290
Yeah. Three, four.

523
01:01:04,860 --> 01:01:11,370
Five. Anybody not anybody earlier that.

524
01:01:17,570 --> 01:01:25,620
In another two, 3 minutes, we'll be ready to discuss sports across the world.

525
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:32,440
They all had once more time today. I think if you were.

526
01:02:02,650 --> 01:02:27,510
Every decision. Nothing gets old because girls never.

527
01:02:29,020 --> 01:02:54,780
Yeah. You're going to go.

528
01:03:30,020 --> 01:03:40,950
All right. Let's go ahead and talk about the answers. So first of all, can anybody tell you when this like what year this paper was published?

529
01:03:44,740 --> 01:03:47,800
1981. 1981. Okay. So.

530
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:54,820
What study designed to make it. Case control.

531
01:03:54,850 --> 01:04:07,370
Yeah. And why do you think they picked up? You remember all of the pros of a case control study.

532
01:04:07,390 --> 01:04:17,080
So do you think there were a lot of cancer cohorts that were mature and had enough cases of pancreatic cancer to study it in a cohort study in 1981?

533
01:04:18,410 --> 01:04:23,940
No. Most of the cancer cohorts I know of were being started in the early to late eighties.

534
01:04:25,110 --> 01:04:28,260
So this was the right study design, right.

535
01:04:28,290 --> 01:04:32,400
You wanted to study a rare disease you wanted. They obviously were kind of fishing.

536
01:04:32,460 --> 01:04:35,520
Right. There would be lots of different potential exposures.

537
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:41,970
So they're really trying to get some have hypotheses early to figure out what they should look at in more detail.

538
01:04:42,660 --> 01:04:46,070
You know, so this is a new right that's new at this point.

539
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:48,690
This is the perfect study design. It's a rare disease.

540
01:04:48,690 --> 01:04:53,579
They don't have the time to do a cohort study cohort studies are on the horizon, but there isn't one yet.

541
01:04:53,580 --> 01:04:56,700
So they're going to do a case control. Okay.

542
01:04:56,700 --> 01:05:09,950
So how did they pick the cases? Yeah.

543
01:05:10,430 --> 01:05:21,460
They just identified the patients. Diagnosed. Great.

544
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:28,600
Yes. They got pancreatic cancer cases diagnosed at these 11 major hospitals in the area within this timeframe.

545
01:05:28,810 --> 01:05:33,310
Perfect. Now we've got our cases. Who are controls?

546
01:05:33,340 --> 01:05:38,880
Why did they pay for their control? Yes.

547
01:05:39,210 --> 01:05:42,600
Other cancer cases where the other cancer cases.

548
01:05:45,460 --> 01:05:46,460
I don't think they are.

549
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:53,770
I think there are other patients of what kind of doctor like who what kind of doctor are seeing these pancreatic cancer patients?

550
01:05:54,100 --> 01:06:00,970
Anybody see that in their. They were.

551
01:06:01,450 --> 01:06:03,740
So they're gastroenterologists, right?

552
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:08,800
And so they're looking for patients of theirs that have other things that aren't cancer, I think, is what I read.

553
01:06:13,310 --> 01:06:19,310
So they're actually not the the doctors that they're getting the cases from are not actually oncologists mostly,

554
01:06:19,310 --> 01:06:23,450
I don't think or at least the ones that are getting the controls from the GI doctors.

555
01:06:23,450 --> 01:06:30,200
Right. So they see pancreatic cancer patients, but also other things. So they're picking other kinds of diseases from GI docs.

556
01:06:31,390 --> 01:06:39,430
Right now, cancer. Okay. So what is kind of the main thing that they find and what is their conclusion?

557
01:06:41,300 --> 01:06:48,150
One of the biggest findings here. I would take a severe coffee before you answer me.

558
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:55,920
Nice big lug. Yep. Most of the association differences between coffee.

559
01:06:58,380 --> 01:07:02,040
Oh, no. I love coffee. No, that can't be.

560
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:05,790
Was it? It was statistically significant. In what direction was coffee protective?

561
01:07:06,810 --> 01:07:11,520
Oh, no. This is terrible news. This is terrible news.

562
01:07:12,540 --> 01:07:15,930
So they conclude that there might be something going on where coffee is causing pancreatic cancer.

563
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:20,550
I mean, they don't come out and say, oh, my God, coffee is the answer. But they say, hey, maybe, maybe coffee is a thing.

564
01:07:22,380 --> 01:07:26,850
Do you think it's causal? Did you all dump your coffee out when you read it?

565
01:07:27,090 --> 01:07:33,480
No. So what do you think the source of bias is given the path of legend out there?

566
01:07:33,780 --> 01:07:37,020
I think there would be a few of them that we read about in this.

567
01:07:37,610 --> 01:07:43,660
And so it's possible that. Father of three.

568
01:07:45,730 --> 01:07:50,240
Reporting incorrectly about. Okay.

569
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:55,610
So let's think through the directionality of misclassification and how it would go real quick.

570
01:07:56,090 --> 01:08:04,399
So you're asking people who are with your kind of cancer and without to remember a long list of things.

571
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:06,290
So we're not singling out coffee, right. They don't.

572
01:08:06,830 --> 01:08:10,640
Based on this questionnaire, they have no way of knowing that coffee is going to be the thing we're going to focus on.

573
01:08:11,210 --> 01:08:15,860
Do you think that cases and non cases are going to remember their coffee drinking differently?

574
01:08:17,660 --> 01:08:23,230
Not necessarily now. Okay. So what direction would that bias the association have?

575
01:08:26,430 --> 01:08:39,780
It is non differential. So again, I'm not differential misclassification biases which way toward the null.

576
01:08:39,790 --> 01:08:42,870
Right. So what was the number of the association?

577
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:46,090
What was the risk? What was the odds ratio they found?

578
01:08:58,250 --> 01:09:10,490
Anybody who's caught up is probably the abstract. 91.8.

579
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:23,379
So that means that if this if there's really not differential misclassification, this is a biased toward the null association.

580
01:09:23,380 --> 01:09:27,490
So the real answer is that coffee is actually more strongly associated.

581
01:09:28,090 --> 01:09:35,500
So it's well, we don't know that that is you are correct, I think in saying that if there's misclassification, it's likely non differential.

582
01:09:35,980 --> 01:09:40,990
And so if misclassification is playing a role, coffee's actually worse than that finding.

583
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:45,930
Okay. Someone had some other.

584
01:09:46,260 --> 01:09:50,430
What were you going to say? I was thinking selection bias could all be true.

585
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:56,440
Yeah. So who are the controls? What are they being treated for if they're at the dry dock?

586
01:09:57,900 --> 01:10:01,540
Joshua does more this year. Sure. What are you going to do with your coffee?

587
01:10:01,540 --> 01:10:06,060
Drinking? If you have any issues.

588
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:14,640
Cut it out. Like if you got a really bad ulcer that's sending you to the doctor was one of the first things you're going to probably stop doing.

589
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:18,630
Drinking coffee? Yeah. So here's the problem.

590
01:10:20,950 --> 01:10:26,170
What we have here is the people without our controls are.

591
01:10:27,700 --> 01:10:31,330
This group is too small, right?

592
01:10:31,780 --> 01:10:40,180
This group is less likely to report exposure because they have quit drinking coffee due to whatever they're at the doctor for.

593
01:10:40,510 --> 01:10:50,440
And so what that means is that if you do your eight times D over B times see your denominator is too small, which makes your odds ratio too big.

594
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:55,660
Does that make sense to you if your odds ratio is.

595
01:10:56,760 --> 01:10:59,940
80 times D Over me time. C Right.

596
01:11:00,210 --> 01:11:06,000
And your B is very small and you have a smaller denominator.

597
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:10,010
It makes the whole odds ratio to make. Yeah.

598
01:11:11,470 --> 01:11:16,930
So this is exactly the example that everyone uses when they talk about hospital based case

599
01:11:16,930 --> 01:11:20,980
control studies having a selection bias because you pick your controls who are already sick.

600
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:26,170
This is the canonical example. Poor McMahon. He had two trips so the rest of us could run.

601
01:11:27,430 --> 01:11:31,780
And this is the canonical example of bergson's bias. So it's okay.

602
01:11:31,790 --> 01:11:32,600
You can drink coffee.

603
01:11:33,470 --> 01:11:38,930
In fact, lots of studies have come out showing that coffee is protective for multiple things, including overall mortality and cancer.

604
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:44,419
In fact, I think there's a big, big study that just came out that actually looked at a decaf separately from brewed coffee,

605
01:11:44,420 --> 01:11:49,750
from instant coffee, and all of them were protective.

606
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:53,930
So if instant coffee really is your thing, I guess go for it to each their own.

607
01:11:57,260 --> 01:12:02,309
Does this make sense to everybody? It's also important to think about other sources of bias, too.

608
01:12:02,310 --> 01:12:08,090
Like, I don't know what they did with. I think the overwhelming problem here is selection bias and then other things could be at play.

609
01:12:08,150 --> 01:12:13,310
Right. There could also be some classification. There can also be some confounding factors that account for sure.

610
01:12:13,550 --> 01:12:18,800
But I think all of that doesn't matter because you already have a sample that is wrong.

611
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:22,879
Right. You already have the wrong comparison groups.

612
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:29,890
So no matter what you do, it's going to be wrong. Any questions?

613
01:12:34,020 --> 01:12:37,590
All right. Enjoy your coffee. Have it the rest of the day.

614
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:43,840
One person from each group learned what you did. If it's not complete, that's fine.
