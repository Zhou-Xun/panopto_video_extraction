00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Population health. Part two. Infant mortality

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
in the first segment of this lecture. We defined and illustrated the concepts of health,

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
public health and population health. In this segment, we'll focus on

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
one of the key measures of population health, which is infant mortality.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Before we can begin to examine the data and historical trends, we need to define

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
a few concepts. Overall, infant mortality is defined

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
as the number of deaths among children under the age of one per 1000

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
live births in a given year. It is a rate, not just the wrong number,

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
and it is sometimes referred to as the infant mortality rate because key

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
risk factors for death among infants differ by age of the child. It can be

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
useful to divide the concept of infant mortality into two subcomponents.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Neonatal mortality is the number of deaths among children under the age

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
of 28 days per 1000 live births in a given year. Again, this is

14
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
a rate. The focus here is on the first month after birth. The immediate

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
newborn period post neonatal mortality is the number

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
of deaths among children between the ages of 28 and 364

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
days per 1000 live births in a given year. Overall, infant

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
mortality is simply the sum of neonatal mortality and post

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
neonatal mortality.

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
As illustrated by the trend curve on this slide, the infant mortality rate in the United

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
States declined by more than 90 percent over the course of the 20th century.

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
And this trend has until recently continued into the 21st century.

23
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
This is one of the great public health success stories. Another way to illustrate

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
the impact of this change is to examine what would have happened if the infant

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,000
mortality rate had remained unchanged. In 2017,

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,000
there were about three point eight six million births in the US,

27
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
with the infant mortality rate of approximately five point eight. This

28
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
works out to about twenty two thousand four hundred infant deaths in 2017.

29
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
If the infant mortality rate in 2017 had been the same as in nineteen hundred,

30
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
which was about one hundred, there would have been about three hundred and eighty six

31
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
thousand infant deaths. Obviously, things have gotten much

32
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
better. So why did

33
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
the infant mortality rate decline so much? What factors contributed

34
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
most significantly to the decline?

35
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
The answer depends on the timeframe. But public health and population health

36
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
played central roles. So here

37
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,000
is the same time curve, but with some divisions or segments of time,

38
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
since the major factors that contributed to the decline in infant mortality have varied

39
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,000
over time, the different timeframes will help us to focus on understanding why things

40
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
improved over time.

41
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Over 50 percent of the total decline in infant mortality occurred by 1940.

42
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Notably, one of the major causes of infant mortality was infection, such as gastrointestinal

43
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
infections from unpasteurized milk and other diarrheal diseases.

44
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Yet the decline occurred mostly before there were any antibiotics.

45
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,000
There were a variety of factors that contributed to this success, mostly related to improved sanitation

46
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
and public health, particularly in urban areas. Examples include

47
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
safer, cleaner drinking water, improved nutrition,

48
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
better disposal of sewage and refuse milk pasteurization,

49
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
which was first used in Chicago in 1988, and coordination

50
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
of public health, social welfare and delivery of medical services.

51
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
One notable example of the change in delivery of medical services is that in nineteen

52
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
hundred, almost all births occurred in the home. But

53
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
by the middle of the 20th century, the vast majority of births were in hospitals

54
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
or clinics.

55
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Between 1940 and 1960, the infant mortality declined

56
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,000
by another 52 percent. However, during this era, the major

57
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
underlying reasons had evolved. Multiple medical advances and or widespread

58
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,000
dissemination into medical practice and services combined to have a major impact.

59
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
These included widespread use of antibiotics, development of fluid

60
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
and electrolyte replacement therapy, such as for treating diarrheal syndromes and

61
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:36,000
safer blood transfusions.

62
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Between 1960 and 1980, the overall infant mortality continued to

63
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
show significant reduction. But the major reasons for the decline differed

64
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
by down by time period during the 1960s. The federal

65
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:57,000
government instituted Medicaid and other federal programs, which made medical

66
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:04,000
services available to millions of people who previously had no health insurance.

67
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
To illustrate the impact of Medicaid, by 2018, 43

68
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
percent of all pregnancies and births in the United States were covered

69
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:21,000
by Medicaid. These changes primarily impacted post neonatal mortality

70
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
in the latter part of this period during the 1970s. There were a number of breakthroughs

71
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,000
in medical practice and technology and dissemination of such practices.

72
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:42,000
These changes resulted in a 40 percent decline in neonatal births.

73
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,000
The decline in infant mortality slowed in the early to mid 1980s,

74
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,000
but then picked up in the 1990s. Various factors contributed to these continued

75
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:59,000
improvements. One major medical breakthrough was the development of artificial

76
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
pulmonary surfactant to treat respiratory distress syndrome in premature infants,

77
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,000
which had a large impact on neonatal mortality. Another major factor

78
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,000
was reduction in deaths from Sudden Infant Infant Death Syndrome, or SIDS.

79
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Following research showing vastly lower incidence of SIDS when babies

80
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,000
are placed on their back rather than their stomach when sleeping.

81
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Another important contributor was the wider dissemination of vaccines against

82
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
many major childhood illnesses such as diphtheria, tetanus, measles,

83
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:46,000
polio and Haemophilus influenza type B.

84
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:52,000
So far, we've been looking solely at trends in infant mortality in the United States,

85
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
which have been very impressive over the last 100 plus years.

86
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:03,000
The Oh ECD, or Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development,

87
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:09,000
includes the thirty seven most economically advanced countries in the world.

88
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:15,000
When we look at infant mortality rates among OPEC members, which includes the US,

89
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
we see a different picture over the last 50 or 60 years. In

90
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
1960, the US ranked number eleven well within the top

91
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
half of all we see these countries. However, by 2014,

92
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
the ranking of the United States had fallen from eleven to twenty four. And in

93
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:41,000
2014, the US infant mortality rate was about two

94
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:47,000
or three times worse than the six countries with the lowest rates.

95
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Yet, as we will see later in this course, the US spends

96
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,000
far more money per capita on health care than any other country in the world.

97
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,000
How can this be? Why has our infant mortality rate fallen behind our peers

98
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
despite much greater overall expenditure of resources? This and

99
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
other deficiencies in our health system will be examined more closely in later

100
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:20,000
sections of the course. To recap,

101
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
population health is more than just numbers. It can reveal trends.

102
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
It allows for comparisons and for assessment of patterns in the data. The data

103
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
can provide for identification of underlying causes or explanation of trends. And importantly,

104
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:41,000
the data can provide a basis for public health interventions. Next up,

105
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:49,499
we will examine life expectancy in the United States.
