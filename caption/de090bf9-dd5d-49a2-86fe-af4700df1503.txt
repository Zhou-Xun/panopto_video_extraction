1
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,480
Okay. So good morning, everyone.

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:12,209
Thank you for making it here. So today we have Dr. Wendy Altman.

3
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:19,680
Again, just to kind of wrap up our section, Ethical and Legal Issues related to genetic testing.

4
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,080
We'll post the slides after class. As we were just saying.

5
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:33,180
And then I just want to remind you that Thursday do not have in-class person going to be working on your exam,

6
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:41,240
which should be accessible Thursday at 8 a.m. until Friday 5 p.m. But it's a time.

7
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:52,620
So once you start, it's 2 hours prior to the guide for Exam two that should help you and I do have office hours

8
00:00:52,620 --> 00:01:03,570
today if you have any questions or you can any questions related to the terminal or the exam.

9
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:08,820
Okay. So I'll have you run the course.

10
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:19,810
So I'm first off, any any questions from last week's class on genetic testing?

11
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:28,620
And that was kind of more of a a walk through of the different types of genetic test.

12
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:33,940
And today we're going to actually talk about the familial and ethical issues with genetic testing.

13
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:40,240
And so this is very much going to be a participatory class.

14
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:48,010
I'm going to be putting up some case scenarios that are actually based on patients that we've seen in the genetics clinic.

15
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:57,729
And just kind of ask your thoughts and then we'll also show after we discuss some of these cases that you can kind of show you the

16
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:05,110
guidance that's available in terms of some of the professional societies and thoughts on how to handle some of the ethical issues.

17
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:14,380
And so the objectives are to help you understand the familial implications of genetic testing and appreciate the ethical issues that are raised.

18
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:20,530
And then we're going to circle back. As I recall, last week, we ended on genomic sequencing.

19
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:25,719
And so we're going to talk about just the issue of secondary findings.

20
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:31,810
So in other words, when you do genomic sequencing, often you're doing it to make a specific diagnosis in a patient,

21
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:36,040
let's say, with intellectual disability or multiple congenital anomalies.

22
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:45,430
But when you're doing genomic sequencing, you also have the ability to learn someone's risk for hereditary cancer or hereditary Alzheimer's disease.

23
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:55,390
And so what should be the what should be the guidance there in terms of learning or, you know, we're having the option to learn those results.

24
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:05,000
And so I hope I convinced you last week that genetic testing is more than checking off a box on form,

25
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:14,840
that it's really important to do risk assessment, to do pretest counseling, obtain informed consent and do post-test counseling.

26
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:20,480
And that obviously, it's not just a blood test.

27
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:28,490
And that's the difference between regular medical care, is that when you're going to the doctor and you get a blood draw,

28
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:37,040
usually what they're doing is a complete blood count or they're looking at your thyroid level and it's about you versus genetic testing,

29
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,410
where the results can have implications beyond yourself to your to your family,

30
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:53,150
because you share 50% of your genetic makeup with your relatives, 25% with your second and 111 eighth with your first cousins.

31
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:58,400
So if you learn about a gene change in yourself, it's got wider implications in the family.

32
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:06,010
And so we talked a little bit to last week, but just in general that when you're doing genetic testing,

33
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:12,820
it could potentially impact your health care, your life decisions, and it could also have a psychosocial impact.

34
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:18,880
And similarly for your relatives, it could also have impacts as well and implications.

35
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:29,400
And as a result, certainly genetic testing and genetic information can result in stress for people.

36
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:33,810
People can have frustration or anger. Why do they have this gene change?

37
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:40,290
There can be sadness and depression or guilt. You know, why did I you know, I have this and I could have passed it on to my children.

38
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:45,180
There can be issues of potentially stigmatization and discrimination.

39
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:49,530
Changes in how someone views their self and changes in family dynamics.

40
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:57,760
And so certainly when we think about genetic information, it raises issues about,

41
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:01,760
you know, is this a personal possession or is it a family possession?

42
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:06,940
And do family members have a moral obligation to share genetic information?

43
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:10,420
And so this really raises the question of who is the patient?

44
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:17,570
Is it only the individual in your clinic? And what about your obligation to other family members?

45
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:20,650
Is there is there a duty to warn other family members?

46
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:27,400
And so these are some of the questions I want you to have in the back of your mind as we kind of go through things here.

47
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:33,570
And so just I put on the slide here, you know, we're not going to get to all of these,

48
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:39,690
but these are just some examples of some of the ethical issues that we face in genetics.

49
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:51,590
And there's a big difference between doing diagnostic testing on someone that has symptoms versus doing testing on someone that is asymptomatic.

50
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:58,280
So someone healthy like everyone here, you know, that doesn't have any known known symptoms of a condition.

51
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:06,180
Okay. First question I'd like to hear from you guys about you are in your twenties,

52
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:12,040
you're healthy and you are at 50% risk for early onset Alzheimer's disease.

53
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:18,130
So would you want to have the genetic test?

54
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:31,600
And you can see there's three right answers on the slide. Yes, no.

55
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:37,820
And undecided. I would presume you would want to have the test.

56
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:43,860
Can you share a little bit more, I guess, just for preparation in the future decisions?

57
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,210
If it's 50%, I mean, it shouldn't rule your life, but it should be considered.

58
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:54,220
So it kind of you're saying like you want to know it shouldn't rule your life, but it's something that you would want to know.

59
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,210
Yeah. Okay. Good answer. What about some others?

60
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:02,320
Yeah. I don't know if I necessarily want to know in my twenties.

61
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:08,350
Probably. Like, I mean, early onset Alzheimer's doesn't usually show up until at least a little bit later,

62
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:14,290
so I'd probably wait until I'm more in the age range for it to be at risk of starting that test.

63
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:17,980
So you would like to enjoy your twenties without having to think about it? No.

64
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:23,630
Okay. I'm not very familiar with the space.

65
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:32,830
I guess. Are there things that can be done to prevent or like delay onset or if you have this is going to happen whether you want it to or not?

66
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:39,040
That's exactly right. Yeah. That if you have the gene change, you're going to have a right to say no.

67
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:48,310
Okay. Sure. Sure. Why? Because if there's nothing that I can do to improve the outcome later in life,

68
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:54,970
I don't want to stress about it early on if it's just going to happen anyway and there's nothing I can do about it.

69
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:58,389
So a little bit like you that you want to go through your twenties without having

70
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:03,070
to think about it and then be able to plan and then be able to plan in the future.

71
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:07,000
And then you're saying if there's nothing you can do about it, then you don't want to know.

72
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:14,330
Right. Yeah. These are all like I say, these are all good answers and exactly what we don't like.

73
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:19,530
Yeah, I guess with that like impact, if this is like a genetic disease,

74
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:23,610
I would probably want to know, like, for having children, like the odds of you passing.

75
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:27,540
So kind of for for being able to plan and and to know about children.

76
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:36,150
Anyone undecided? Yeah.

77
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:42,630
I feel like I'd be interested either way. Um, so if I like, I have it, I'd just be waiting for, like, symptoms.

78
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:50,250
And then if I didn't test, I'd be like, Oh, but what if I have it? So I was like, Either way, I would just be very anxious.

79
00:08:51,030 --> 00:09:01,610
Yeah. Right. I had actually it was in a Gary Larson cartoon that that that at the bottom it says, come on, it's either one door or the other.

80
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:05,960
And on the left, it says, damned if you do. And on the break it says, damned if you don't.

81
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:14,900
You know, which I think kind of I think kind of gets to that sentiment of, you know, either way, there's there's issues of knowing or not knowing.

82
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:18,110
Like, it's great if you can be told, I don't have it and you can just take it off.

83
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:22,489
You know, off the yacht, off the deck completely.

84
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:26,000
But what if you do have it and then it's going forward with that knowledge?

85
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:33,920
Any other thoughts? Tough decision, isn't it?

86
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:46,070
And, you know, I think that that is your you know, as you could see here just in this room, you had some people that were saying yes,

87
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:52,820
some that were saying no, some that were saying undecided, which is all the reason why a doctor should not make a decision for a patient.

88
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:57,979
And, you know, sometimes this happens where, you know, a doctor will hear kind of early on,

89
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:01,670
you know, family history of Alzheimer's disease and order in order to test.

90
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:07,900
And so we see patients on the back end where they're like, you know, I didn't know my doctor was ordering this test.

91
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:10,400
I wish I had known because I don't want this information.

92
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:18,949
So it's real important and you know, that that there be informed consent and that patients be,

93
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:22,640
you know, really think through whether they want this information or not.

94
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:31,310
And, you know, what I have, too, is like sometimes when I'm teaching this is I have a slide that says knowledge is power.

95
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:37,310
And on the other side, ignorance is bliss. And the others all kind of cross this road when I get to it.

96
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:44,590
And that's where in the same family you can see siblings that make very different decisions, family members that makes different decisions.

97
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:53,690
We started to talk about this, but what are your thoughts about, you know, if you were to be tested, when when would you want to know?

98
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:58,630
So I think you've already said like you want to know with with children potentially.

99
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,020
Do you want to find out now and decide whether to stay for the rest of this class or not?

100
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:16,610
All in grad school. Any thoughts?

101
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:27,640
Do you see an optimal time period? Okay.

102
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:33,400
I guess when considering having children or near the typical age, you'd want to know.

103
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:46,490
I think like the the prime time would just really depend on what you want to know and like how you want to use your results.

104
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:52,159
I guess personally, if I had to now, it would be near the typical age of onset,

105
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,490
because then I don't have to go through life like stressing about everything.

106
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:07,680
I can say that I've had patients, you know, really with all all of these.

107
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:11,790
So I've had some that come in and said, look, I want to know if I have this gene change,

108
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:18,200
because if if I'm going to get in this case, it's more Huntington's disease, which also causes early onset dementia.

109
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:21,030
They're like, you know, then I don't want to be in a Ph.D. program.

110
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:26,130
I want to travel the world and, you know, do everything that I can before I have onset of the condition.

111
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:30,330
And certainly I've seen patients, too, that like, well,

112
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:35,430
I want to know because if I have the gene change, then I want to stay in the group practice I'm in.

113
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:41,610
That was a dentist that said that. And if I don't have it, then I want to go off on my own and open my own private practice.

114
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:49,589
Some people have wanted to know before they buy a home that if they know that they're going to have a progressive neurological condition,

115
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:53,130
that they're going to want to get a home that's going to potentially be wheelchair accessible.

116
00:12:54,960 --> 00:13:01,080
Marriage, for sure. I've had actually some patients come in like couple of weeks before their wedding.

117
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:06,570
And usually what I've done there is this really what you want to learn before your wedding?

118
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:11,670
You know that if you have the gene change, it's been there since you were conceived.

119
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:17,310
And we can either give you the best wedding gift ever, that you don't have the gene change,

120
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:20,790
but there's a 50% chance we're going have to tell you that you do have the gene change.

121
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:25,530
And do you really want to know that within days of getting married?

122
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:32,729
I'm actually also this is the time of year to where we when we see patients coming in because of a

123
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:38,400
family history of Huntington's disease or early onset Alzheimer's disease or ALS that we bring up.

124
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:44,310
Okay. You know, it's now November. And do you want to learn these results around the holidays?

125
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:51,900
And so some people just haven't thought about that and some are like, oh, gosh, no, I don't want to know my results at Christmas time.

126
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:56,180
And the others are saying, you know, guess what?

127
00:13:56,190 --> 00:14:01,530
I do want to find out my results. And because then my family will be home and we can talk about it in person.

128
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:07,170
So the holidays, timing of doing genetic testing around the holidays can go either way.

129
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:12,960
And then I think as a two of you indicated or this row indicated,

130
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:21,630
kind of near the typical age of onset and and decisions around children is often when we see patients coming in for genetic testing like this.

131
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:29,400
All right. For those thinking about being tested, guess what?

132
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:32,030
There's now expanding ways that people can get tested.

133
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:39,380
So what are your thoughts when you think about doing that in a doctor's office versus thinking about doing testing?

134
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:46,850
As you can see, part of employment wellness program or direct to consumer genetic testing.

135
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:55,190
Any concerns about doing testing in any of those settings? The thoughts?

136
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:06,820
Yeah. I would want to do it in the doctor's office or like with a professional, because I don't know much about like,

137
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:11,480
well, I guess now I know more, but I don't know a lot about the results of what they mean.

138
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,000
So I wouldn't want to prove myself those things.

139
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:21,500
So being able to have someone there that understands them and can, can, can, can provide counseling at that point.

140
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:29,490
Since. Anyone interested in doing it in their own home or at work?

141
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:41,380
If you like it, if you do it at home, like who do you have to report that to?

142
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:48,610
Or like, how would that like impact like diagnosis and stuff like from like an insurance perspective?

143
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:53,319
Right. I mean, like, if you do something like at home, then it's not in your medical records.

144
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:57,280
Right? And it's not billed to insurance because you're paying out of pocket.

145
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:03,120
Now, as we talked about last week,

146
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:09,630
the tests that are available direct to consumer are not the same ones that you would get necessarily in a genetics clinic.

147
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:18,680
Could you test with like a direct to consumer and have the results be different in like a doctor's office?

148
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:23,780
That's what I'm saying. Yeah, right. Because it's back to doing kind of snip based testing.

149
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,950
But there are some labs that are starting to you know,

150
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:35,870
there are some tests that are starting to be offered that are similar to the ones that would be done for employment.

151
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:45,590
Once you get know actually that is not the actual company itself have access to records that your employer.

152
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:49,350
That's that's the key question. That's the key question.

153
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:56,010
And technically, they're not supposed to you know, this is all the in terms of doing it as part of an employment wellness program.

154
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,140
This is actually a very new area.

155
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:06,720
And technically, what they're supposed to be getting back is more aggregate data on employees, but not specific employees.

156
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:17,100
But you know what the actual practices are. That's something that I'm actually involved in a national study right now called the Insight Study.

157
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:21,360
And actually, one of the pieces is Scott Roberts here in the School of Public Health.

158
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,310
And we're actually looking at that.

159
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:31,330
And I think it kind of raises different different if different issues, right, about having, you know, doing genetic testing in the workplace.

160
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:37,010
And are those records completely private? Yeah, I'll look to that.

161
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:43,849
So does HIPA actually apply to companies that are they do not apply if the company offers them hip as because a hip

162
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:49,460
is not a it's that that's a whole issue about data sharing and everything else because companies are not hospitals.

163
00:17:50,120 --> 00:18:04,480
So. So as we talked about last week in terms of Angelina Jolie, like she made the decision to get tested for BRCA one,

164
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:08,440
which did have implications for her health care decisions.

165
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:13,440
But as we're talking about, too, is that genetic testing can also impact life decisions.

166
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:21,299
And so as I mentioned right that the reasons to be tested and and I think someone brought up anxiety,

167
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:25,410
you know, kind of like being, you know, maybe being freed from the relief, from the anxiety of not knowing.

168
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:32,070
But, you know, but others will say, look, I don't want to know because, you know, my anxiety is going to go up.

169
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,879
If I find out if I have the gene change, I may not enjoy life as much.

170
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,880
I may be checking all the time or wondering if I'm having symptoms.

171
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:48,040
But why people may consider it is because of things we've been talking about, you know, marriage,

172
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:53,290
having children, career finances, housing, travel, you know, making those types of decisions.

173
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:09,720
Okay. So let's say that you have undergone genetic testing and you find out that you have a gene change and therefore your child's at 50% risk.

174
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:21,410
So would you test the child? I wouldn't.

175
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,559
I would let the child decide if they want to get tested.

176
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:28,730
Like once they're 18 or like one. They're an adult and they're an adult.

177
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:34,500
Okay. I mean, we got to talked about this last time, but I think, you know,

178
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:41,280
it depends on if the disease could affect them in their childhood or not with something like early onset Alzheimer's.

179
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:47,460
I would wait until they're adult and are able to choose if it's something that could onset while they're a child.

180
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:58,510
Then that's more you have to decide for them. So we want an agreement with that.

181
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:02,780
We make we make decisions all the time to test our our children.

182
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,890
Do you think it's a parent's right to know,

183
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:18,080
or do you concur that if it's an adult onset condition and should wait until the child's an adult and let them decide?

184
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:29,780
I think that it might be different if it were a disease where preventative health care could start in childhood.

185
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:34,940
But for a case like this, if there's nothing you can do, I would like to know.

186
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:41,570
And then here in the green. Oh, I was going to say, I thought she said the same thing.

187
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,140
Okay, great. Okay.

188
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:50,750
Well, here's Angelina. You know, some of them have done it for Alzheimer's disease, but what about breast cancer?

189
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:59,770
Here's a Brad and Angelina in happier times. Same thoughts there.

190
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,920
Clearly, they've got several kids that are at risk.

191
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:10,840
I let the biological children I think they have I think they had three biological children together.

192
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:16,440
That would be at 50% risk to have the BRCA one gene change.

193
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:25,940
I guess the way that I think about it is like as the parent, I had the option to decide what I wanted to do.

194
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:31,550
And I think that my child should have that same option to decide for themselves whether or not.

195
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:36,700
So that's just kind of what I think about it. Yeah. Okay.

196
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:49,389
And so there you go. You know, is that the I can't tell you how many times that this has been raised with me,

197
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:52,710
you know, in clinic where people have said, look, I want to be able to test my child.

198
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:58,990
I'm their parent. I even had one parent say, look, I want to know which child is going to have Huntington's disease,

199
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:04,840
because if the child's going to have Huntington's disease and I want to use my money on the other child, that does not.

200
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:13,210
You know, when of course, you know, a Huntington's disease for someone could be years away, decades away.

201
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:19,090
But to make that type of decision but it shows, you know, some of the financial hardships of families.

202
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:28,300
But figuring out for a child, for an adult onset condition is contrary to the guidance here, as you could see.

203
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:35,770
And kind of all the points that you've been raising. Right, is that unless there is a clinical intervention appropriate in childhood,

204
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:43,660
parents should be encouraged to defer predictive or predisposition testing for adult onset conditions until adulthood.

205
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:55,850
And then in this report as well, it says that you have to defer genetic testing for late onset conditions until adulthood.

206
00:22:56,630 --> 00:23:01,940
And there are several different organizations that have come out that way. The currently.

207
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:05,690
So if a parent requests these kinds of tests for their children,

208
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:13,300
are professionals required to give me tests and know where they're able to use the guidance here.

209
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:17,900
You know, and say to the parent, this is what I want you to do is say to the parent,

210
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:21,770
there's nothing that would be done differently for your child's care.

211
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:30,350
You know, it's one thing if it's like a hereditary early onset colon cancer, like familial adeno, which is polyposis, for example,

212
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:39,620
where where you can develop hundreds of polyps and there's a cancer risk and that you would start doing an intervention in childhood,

213
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:46,210
that you would start having colonoscopies. So that's very different than something like a breast cancer risk.

214
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:51,880
That would not be until much later or an Alzheimer's or ALS or Huntington's.

215
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:53,570
It would also not be until much later.

216
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:03,339
And so, you know, that said, like I say, definitely pet parents try to push to say, look, I want to know this information.

217
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:05,980
It's hard for me to raise my child not knowing this information.

218
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:11,980
And then usually what I'm able to do is just turn it back and say, well, how would you felt if your status had been determined?

219
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:17,620
You know, you waited to come in here until you were in your thirties. Shouldn't your child have that same opportunity?

220
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:36,230
All right. So now we have a child who's 18. And so what do you think there should a child be able to be tested now that they're 18?

221
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:41,770
How much do you guys know about health insurance? Life insurance? Long term disability?

222
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:49,920
Long term care? Stable financially, our college students, grad students.

223
00:24:54,510 --> 00:25:02,180
Does this change anything for you guys? Took me a while to find this photo of you preaching and stuff.

224
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:10,370
I feel like if adult now knows that they have a history of it, they could choose to be tested.

225
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:14,719
But like, I don't know if we should be going around on the street,

226
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:20,570
like encouraging people to get genetic tests if they have no history or risk of anything.

227
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:28,850
Yeah, I think I think because like the insurance is still tied to like, parents.

228
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:37,429
So there's like still issues with like insurance policies and like, it still could be like encouraged by the parent,

229
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:44,350
even if the kid doesn't want it because like, oh, my insurance is going to go up, like you should get this test or something like that too.

230
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:49,460
Yeah, health insurance is in there, but it is.

231
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:58,220
It's age 18. Might be a difficult time considering those life insurance factors.

232
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,240
Insurance factors?

233
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:09,080
Yeah, I don't know about the rising costs, but when I was 18, I was not thinking about long term life insurance or like long term care insurance.

234
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:11,809
And so I think having a limited knowledge of that,

235
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:22,160
like they wouldn't be fully informed about what the implications of a positive result could mean, like so far later down the line.

236
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:30,800
Yeah. No, I mean, the insurance issues are very real.

237
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:36,799
And I never you know, it's interesting, when my my children turned 18 and then,

238
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:40,160
you know, it's obviously their doctor's appointments or their doctor's appointments.

239
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:45,680
And I went with them for the first time. You know, it's like they have to they, you know,

240
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:51,020
when they were switching from a pediatrician to an internist and they're like, you know, hey, mom, can I have the car keys?

241
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:54,980
And I'm like, yes, you can have the car keys and I'm happy to have you drive, but I'm going to come with you.

242
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:59,719
And they go, I don't need you. I don't need you on a seven year old. I'm just going to I'm going to bring my work.

243
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:03,110
I'm just going to sit there. I'm not going to go in there to see the doctor with you.

244
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:07,610
But I'm just I'm just going to come and, you know, no, no, I don't need you.

245
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:11,209
And, you know, they go and they get the forms and they come back.

246
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:15,200
And within a couple of minutes, it was like, Mom, what does this mean here?

247
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:21,110
And I just kind of looked up. It looked like, you know, I waited a couple of minutes and then I said, this is why I wanted to come, is that, you know,

248
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:27,889
there's a lot to take in over your own health care and and all the different forms and having to think through everything.

249
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:31,820
And what do you want? You know, what you're signing off on as well.

250
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:35,240
So I don't think our health care makes it easy for sure.

251
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:42,830
And then I think with insurance right now, it's in a bit of a precarious position.

252
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:51,560
I mean, we certainly have the Affordable Care Act and that is fortunately providing care and covering insurance up to age 26.

253
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:59,720
But that's you know, that's like I say, it's in a precarious position whether we will retain that law and that coverage.

254
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:05,689
I have. You know, that said, I have had I have had patients like as soon as they've turned 18,

255
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:09,380
they've said, look, I've grown up with a parent with this condition. I need to know.

256
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:19,340
And we've gone ahead and tested them and then others where we've made clear, you know, obviously we make clear to all patients the insurance issues.

257
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:24,010
And then someone we've made clear those insurance issues. They're like, Whoa, I wasn't aware of all that.

258
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:28,150
You know, I'll wait till I have a job. So.

259
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:33,569
And so, as we talked about last time, is that depending on the genetic condition,

260
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:38,520
the test results could impact health insurance, life insurance, disability and long term care.

261
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:42,950
And so for some of these conditions, you know, we'll say to a patient, you know,

262
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:47,650
you just want to have desired insurance coverage in place prior to undergoing the genetic test.

263
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:56,560
Okay. Now someone is pregnant. Pregnancies now at 50% risk.

264
00:28:56,570 --> 00:29:01,020
What are some thoughts? I'm going to start over on this side of the room.

265
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:06,050
What are your thoughts here? I probably still want to.

266
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:14,830
I think it just kind of falls into the same thing as testing a child. What are your thoughts?

267
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:21,880
Not agree with that since we're still talking about the early onset Alzheimer's, since it is.

268
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:28,110
I'm. This is not really a reason to test during pregnancy.

269
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:34,050
Okay. Any other thoughts on this one?

270
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:40,809
I just wonder what the motivation is behind testing of pregnancy.

271
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:46,840
Like if you're concerned about passing something on to a child. You would think that you'd want to test yourself first.

272
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:50,110
Yeah, I'm saying that this person has been tested, so we know the pregnancies at 50%.

273
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:53,860
Oh, I see. Okay. But that's actually a good point, because sometimes we have it.

274
00:29:54,550 --> 00:30:00,640
We'll show you later. Actually, that. Yeah. So, like, if you're testing a pregnancy, what's your motivation behind doing that?

275
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,720
If it's to like terminate the pregnancy based on the results?

276
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:13,900
I think that's getting into a little bit of a scary realm of like eugenics type things

277
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:18,670
depending on what that condition is and how often people may decide to do that.

278
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:27,820
I'm wondering what the I guess the scenario is.

279
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,240
So if the person is pregnant, they still have.

280
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:38,150
Like a child is born, so they have autonomy over their body. It's technically a part of their body, so I'm not sure.

281
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:43,520
Exactly. The line seems really blurred.

282
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:55,660
So what your thoughts be different if this was. A condition in childhood that could affect a child.

283
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:18,060
It says your primary audio source is very quiet or silent.

284
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:27,790
It's. Typically for diseases that are onset in childhood don't.

285
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:34,180
Most people usually do like IVF, where they can test embryos develop and sometimes then you're talking about,

286
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:40,570
right, talking pre-implantation genetic diagnosis or prenatal testing for something, you know, both are options.

287
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:46,200
Depending on finances, though, right? No.

288
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:53,309
I think you bring up finances and like I guess as somebody who's worked with a lot of children with disabilities,

289
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:57,209
I see like how much time it takes and how much energy.

290
00:31:57,210 --> 00:32:03,420
And it's almost like. Kind of like you have to have these resources in order to like.

291
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:15,300
Do that, and some people may not. I guess it was, for lack of a better term, it's almost like a privilege to have a child with a disability.

292
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:23,960
So I think, yeah, it gets very the line gets very blurry and it can be difficult to decide.

293
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:37,660
So I mean, what we're talking about here is obviously the whole options of doing prenatal testing, which is is available,

294
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:45,700
but raises different issues in terms of decision making around continuing or not continuing a pregnancy.

295
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:53,629
So, you know, here what we're thinking about, right, is, is should someone have the, you know,

296
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:59,870
have the ability to test a pregnancy for a condition that's not going to have onset until adulthood?

297
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:03,580
And so you've raised, you know, on this side of the room, you know,

298
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:08,989
I think the important consideration is that how does this differ then for testing a child for an adult onset condition?

299
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:13,910
And shouldn't the similar principle apply here that kind of put your.

300
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:21,310
You're saying, because if someone's going to say I'm going to test a pregnancy for early

301
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:27,070
onset Alzheimer's disease and I'm going to continue the pregnancy regardless,

302
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:35,709
then what they have done is prenatal, determined, determine the status of a minor and divide it of a future minor.

303
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:42,520
And they are also not allowing that that future child to grow up and have the autonomy

304
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:46,840
to decide for themselves whether or not to have that their status determined.

305
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:56,270
And so, as you can see here, the National Society of Genetic Counselors does not recommend prenatal genetic testing for

306
00:33:56,270 --> 00:34:02,690
known adult onset conditions if pregnancy or childhood management will not be affected.

307
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:11,120
And then certainly we recommend obviously be reading, meeting with a genetic counselor to discuss.

308
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:16,190
And and it's said, you know, as you says down here at the bottom of that,

309
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:24,590
that concerns that prenatal testing for adult onset conditions may deny child's future autonomy and potential for genetic discrimination.

310
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:30,530
So essentially this would not be done unless, you know,

311
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:35,840
people are going to use the information to make a decision about whether they're going to continue or not continue a pregnancy.

312
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:44,160
Okay. I think you started to raise this scenario here, so maybe.

313
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:48,830
What do you want to do here? So now you have you have an adult child.

314
00:34:50,430 --> 00:34:56,110
And they're at 25% risk. What their parent has decided.

315
00:34:57,010 --> 00:35:04,339
The parents decided they don't want to know. And how I had this had the situation.

316
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:10,020
Yes, I've had this several times. Again.

317
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:13,139
I've had it for a condition called Huntington's disease, which results.

318
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:21,630
And it's kind of like a combination of like the Parkinson's and Alzheimer's because you have a movement disorder and you have a cognitive disorder.

319
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:33,780
And so here you have a child that says, you know, look, I would like to get tested, but my mom does not want to know.

320
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:41,440
I mean, if they had it and the parent obviously has it.

321
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:44,620
So, like, do you have like, what's the informing?

322
00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:49,020
Like, if they don't want to know, how do you keep that type of thing?

323
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:53,820
Like, it's their individual choice, but like it has implications on the back end.

324
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:58,450
It has implications on the back end. So what do you think? You know what? When you want to say a little bit more about that.

325
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:03,690
I agree. I don't know.

326
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:11,070
Because, like, if they. Really want to know they have that right.

327
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:16,340
There you go. I don't know.

328
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:19,900
I guess I don't know about it.

329
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:24,190
I don't know what you would do about that. Right. Because you have kind of two competing rights, right?

330
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:28,670
Because you have a child that wants to know and you have a parent that does not want to know.

331
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:39,800
I'm a little bit confused because if they are an adult, if the child is an adult patient, then isn't it independent of the parent?

332
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:47,530
But is the genetic information independent of the parents? What if the child goes to a clinic and then they get tested?

333
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:50,760
Then the parent doesn't have to. No, that's true. That is true.

334
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:54,750
But is there an obligation for us to make sure the parent knows? I don't know.

335
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:58,629
I mean, I'm just throwing this out. I'm saying this is what it raises.

336
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:03,010
Right. And certainly raises issues of secrets in families.

337
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:16,250
As well. Yeah, I know. But both of them being autonomous adults, it's not really a place for a provider to kind of dictate who knows what.

338
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:20,930
If someone comes to you and wants a test, that's their own business.

339
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:24,889
And if they're okay with keeping that secret from their family, that's also their own business.

340
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:28,190
And while we may not agree with, like the ethical implications,

341
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:33,950
we can't really control that if it's an autonomous patient coming to us with their information.

342
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:43,350
Sure. This one? Yep. I kind of agree with.

343
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:54,260
But she said that, like, if you're a consenting adult, you should be able to get the test regardless of any family issues that may fall out.

344
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:01,470
Would you like my job? This is this. This is. This is like this.

345
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:09,660
These are some of the challenges that we do face. And I can say that, you know, sometimes when we've made the.

346
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:17,100
And you're all correct, right. These are autonomous. And, you know, this is the person that's my patient is the patient that's seated in front of me.

347
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:23,160
But we also always have to think broadly, you know, what could be the broader impact here.

348
00:38:23,850 --> 00:38:27,930
But ultimately, my responsibilities are to the patient that's in my clinic.

349
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:33,620
And in this situation, sometimes when we've let the person know, you know, hey, do you know, you know,

350
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:38,640
you realize that if your results are positive, then we would be learning that your mother is positive.

351
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:43,799
And, you know, have you talked to her about this? And sometimes they're like, Oh yeah, I've talked to my mom.

352
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:44,910
I'm sure she would come in.

353
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:53,700
And because obviously if we can get the parent tested first, that's a better way to proceed than the child learning the parents result.

354
00:38:54,690 --> 00:39:01,440
But that's not always possible. And so sometimes the person's like, you know, look, I want to know, my mother doesn't want to know.

355
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:04,920
And I need this information to go forward and live my life.

356
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:10,320
In which case, you know, we would go ahead and test the person at 25% risk.

357
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:16,170
And we would certainly make note in the letter, you know, about the implications to their parent.

358
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:22,740
But ultimately, you know, do we have a duty to warn that's going to come up in a couple of minutes here.

359
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:29,420
So. So in this situation, like I say, we you know,

360
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:36,260
we would say that the person's right to know would take priority over the the parent's right not

361
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:41,150
to know that they have a right to go forward and plan their life learning this information.

362
00:39:44,350 --> 00:39:48,159
I had this happen once, just one time, fortunately, in 35 years.

363
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:53,299
But. We had identical twins.

364
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:58,040
They were at 50% risk for Huntington's disease. One twin was here in Michigan.

365
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:05,390
The other twin was in New Jersey. The twin here in Michigan said he wanted to know, but the twins did not want to know.

366
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:16,130
Would you test the twin? I just had a quick question.

367
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:24,930
I know you mentioned that there were guidelines, but so do any of these questions have concrete correct answers like based on.

368
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:30,380
Those guidelines or is it you have to use your best judgment and it's both, right?

369
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:32,640
It's like is it in other words, that the issue you know,

370
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:41,010
the guidelines are pretty clear on the testing children for adult onset conditions, and they're also pretty clear on the prenatal testing.

371
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:51,720
And then there are principles that you kind of are are applying for recondition for situations that are not covered in the guidelines.

372
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:57,930
And then also, you know, it's a lot, you know, with what is now certain but is certainly available.

373
00:40:57,930 --> 00:41:03,480
And that people probably should be using more often is that if you're working in a hospital, is that there's an ethics committee.

374
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:08,969
And so that you could potentially say to an ethics committee, this is the situation.

375
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:14,970
And what are your thoughts? Because on an ethics committee, you have legal and ethical experts that can weigh in.

376
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:30,250
I feel like this case is really similar to the last one as far as like the age we should be able to get that's testing.

377
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:37,620
But then it like the only thing I think of is like if the twin the twin who didn't get tested doesn't want to know,

378
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:42,420
has children of their own like and they want to know their risk.

379
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:47,520
Like, do they go to the the twin and like try to find out.

380
00:41:55,500 --> 00:42:04,979
So would people, tester or not. Sounds like you're saying I can't that you would test because the fact that they that the twin has

381
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:11,010
the right to know and shouldn't be denied testing because of the virtue of being born a twin.

382
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:20,550
Is that kind of. Is it possible that because I know especially stuff like Huntington's disease has a varying penetrance.

383
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:28,110
Is it possible that even if these twins had the same gene that one could develop and one could not based on penetrance?

384
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:31,679
Or is it like a guarantee from. Yeah, no, that's a good question.

385
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:36,480
With actually Huntington's, we say that it's fully penetrant, that if you live long enough, you will develop symptoms.

386
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:45,890
But there can be variable in terms of age of onset of symptoms. It's one of the few conditions that we can say that for.

387
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:59,200
Thoughts over here. Like I'm kind of in the same boat.

388
00:42:59,230 --> 00:43:05,130
Like, if one twin wants to know, then the other person's desire, not emotion.

389
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:09,490
And it flipped on their will. They just don't have to tell them. Like it might be hard not to tell them.

390
00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:15,610
And they should respect their other twin not only to know, but they do have every right to know.

391
00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:24,280
And we agreed with that. And so we actually did go ahead and see the twin that was here in Michigan.

392
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:29,920
And then it turned out that the Twins results were positive for Huntington's.

393
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:38,260
And so I included in the letter, you know, obviously this means that your twin brother,

394
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:42,280
if he is identical because sometimes people say twins are identical and they're not,

395
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:47,140
but if your twin is identical, then this means he does have the gene change.

396
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:53,770
You know, that you've indicated that you're, you know, at this time not sharing the results because your brother didn't want to know.

397
00:43:54,790 --> 00:44:03,940
But if you did share, you know, at some point here are resources in New Jersey, both genetic counseling and support support groups.

398
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:15,910
It turned out what our patient did. Even though he said he wasn't going to tell his twin, he ended up driving to New Jersey and telling his twin.

399
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:20,990
And we ended up seeing the twin in our clinic several months later.

400
00:44:24,390 --> 00:44:29,830
Not all my stories have a happy ending. I guess so. But as you can see here.

401
00:44:29,830 --> 00:44:35,200
Yep. So what we're balancing. I hope you like the animation is the right to know versus the right not to know.

402
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:41,069
And as I mentioned yet for some people, knowledge is power. Ignorance is bliss.

403
00:44:41,070 --> 00:44:49,240
And most people say, you know, to I'll cross that bridge when I get to it. And so I think these have demonstrated, you know,

404
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:53,080
that certainly it's a patient's choice to be tested and that their values and preferences

405
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:56,560
need to drive their decision about whether or not to have predictive genetic testing.

406
00:44:57,190 --> 00:45:03,460
And it's important to explore with people kind of their reasons, thoughts and considerations about testing and to respect those.

407
00:45:05,710 --> 00:45:10,030
And so it certainly brings up issues, though, you know, you should see the results.

408
00:45:10,030 --> 00:45:12,700
So you can see here I am, I guess over 20 years ago,

409
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:20,920
and this was when the President Clinton issued the executive order on genetic nondiscrimination in the workplace.

410
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:24,490
And I had the honor of being there when that happened.

411
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,590
And so as you can see that my perspective on this, while you can see President Clinton said,

412
00:45:29,590 --> 00:45:33,670
I believe no employer should ever review your genetic records along with your resume.

413
00:45:34,210 --> 00:45:40,210
And I had said that every one of us is at risk for having a genetic condition that has an underlying genetic component.

414
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:50,479
So. And so certainly as you've seen, I think that there are ethical issues that are raised in terms of disclosure of these results.

415
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:57,470
And then what about is there a duty to warn? So what are your thoughts on that?

416
00:45:57,980 --> 00:46:04,610
Do you think that as health care providers thinking about the situation with the identical twin,

417
00:46:04,610 --> 00:46:12,670
thinking about the parent that didn't want to know, do I have an obligation as a health care provider knowing my patients results?

418
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:16,860
Do I have an obligation to inform? At risk relatives.

419
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:25,650
What are your thoughts? Yes, I think if they hadn't said they don't want to know, then yes.

420
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:32,580
But because they specifically said or if someone told you that they said they don't want to know.

421
00:46:35,730 --> 00:46:44,810
You shouldn't tell them. I think that's.

422
00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:53,680
You're all doing. Well, these are these are these are challenging issues.

423
00:46:55,410 --> 00:47:02,480
Yeah. You like you could meet with them and kind of explain the implications of knowing and not knowing.

424
00:47:02,490 --> 00:47:07,230
And then based on that, they can make the decision for themselves should they know or not.

425
00:47:12,770 --> 00:47:19,129
And so certainly, you know, I'm thinking about issues of disclosing genetic information and especially because,

426
00:47:19,130 --> 00:47:23,900
you know, you kind of can figure out in a family who are the identifiable relatives at risk.

427
00:47:24,830 --> 00:47:32,720
But it raises big issues just in terms of privacy and privacy of medical records and privacy and confidentiality of information.

428
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:40,790
So I guess here is a scenario. What are your thoughts here?

429
00:47:40,850 --> 00:47:46,350
And then I'll go to the guidance. But it's true. The doctor notified the patient's sister about the 50% risk.

430
00:47:46,370 --> 00:47:51,290
So here you figured out the patient's mother died of breast cancer at age 50.

431
00:47:51,290 --> 00:47:59,930
And we know that the sister has a BRCA one mutation and she is had said, I am not going to tell my sister.

432
00:48:02,470 --> 00:48:08,020
And we know they're screening that can be done and everything. So is there a duty to warn the sister?

433
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:16,930
Wouldn't they already be aware of the risk considering the mother?

434
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:26,040
So can they not? You can still make that individual choice even without, you know, without knowing.

435
00:48:26,050 --> 00:48:29,120
Okay. Other thoughts?

436
00:48:31,370 --> 00:48:40,100
I want to say is that if we can 100% absolutely guarantee that this is true cancer, that that they should be reformed.

437
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:47,750
But is there a right to share the the specific gene change or just go by the history?

438
00:48:48,170 --> 00:48:57,850
Let's see what I was going to say. As a provider, it seems like your duty is to the patient, not necessarily people outside of that person.

439
00:48:57,860 --> 00:49:03,649
And I think the best way to go about this would just be to like reiterate to the patient,

440
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:08,040
you know, you were able to decide for yourself, shouldn't like.

441
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:13,420
Other people in your family also have the right to decide.

442
00:49:13,630 --> 00:49:18,250
But I don't think that a provider has to go outside of their patient.

443
00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:26,859
The interesting thing here is in terms of cost to the health care system, if you know the gene change,

444
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:31,120
it's actually like $250 or something just to test for that specific gene change.

445
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:38,830
But to do the testing for, you know, if you have to kind of sequence the genes letter by letter, it's a much more costly test.

446
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:46,749
So there are issues here that you could actually save the health care system a lot of money if you were to say to the sister at 50% risk,

447
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:53,230
yeah, we know the gene change in your family. We can just test for that. But you have the issue here that the sister doesn't want to share that.

448
00:49:55,820 --> 00:50:00,440
I think it would be a harder issue if the sisters are in the same practice with the doctor.

449
00:50:01,430 --> 00:50:07,280
Couldn't you still test for that gene specifically and not give them like the.

450
00:50:08,030 --> 00:50:11,390
I suppose that has its own ethical set out its own ethical issues,

451
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:18,080
but you're being creative just that we're just going to look for this one gene as opposed to just look with the BRCA one gene.

452
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:21,680
We're not going to look at BRCA two and we're not going to look at any of these other genes.

453
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:24,860
We're just going to look at this one gene because we have a hunch it might be there.

454
00:50:25,290 --> 00:50:29,360
Yeah. Now it raises some other you're right. Raises some other ethical issues.

455
00:50:35,810 --> 00:50:41,780
And so there is a just a statement that's been put out by the American Society of Human Genetics.

456
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:45,859
And again, you're going to get copies of all these slides that's over 20 years old.

457
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:49,280
But as you could see, that disclosure would be permitted, you know, is permissible,

458
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:53,210
where attempts to encourage disclosure on the part of the patient have failed.

459
00:50:53,780 --> 00:51:03,349
And then, as you can see here, it's that it's the second bullet and sometimes that fourth bullet that can be more problematic with

460
00:51:03,350 --> 00:51:10,110
some of the genetic conditions and our ability to to test versus the gap in our ability to turn.

461
00:51:12,250 --> 00:51:17,920
And so and also here, you know, what we know in terms of someone that has a BRCA one gene change,

462
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:23,830
you can say, you know, is a harm highly likely to occur? That's kind of getting to some of the points on this side of the room.

463
00:51:24,190 --> 00:51:29,020
And it's serious and foreseeable. But the problem is, is that it's not imminent.

464
00:51:29,170 --> 00:51:33,400
You know, it could be years off and it may, may or may not happen at all.

465
00:51:34,150 --> 00:51:42,400
So if someone has a gene change for BRCA one, they have about an 85% chance, you know, up to an 85% chance to develop breast cancer.

466
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:49,220
So that means 15% do not, but happens if you don't have the contact info for the sibling.

467
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:54,840
Is the patient obligated to provide? You know, that's why I'm saying I'm not obligated to.

468
00:51:54,850 --> 00:51:59,410
I'm not we're not we're not obligated to disclose. Oh, you're not obligated.

469
00:51:59,770 --> 00:52:10,990
Not obligated because it doesn't it doesn't meet the it doesn't meet the it doesn't meet the criteria that it's foreseeable.

470
00:52:13,070 --> 00:52:17,440
Part of using the word foreseeable meaning kind of more like imminent, you know, in the next few years.

471
00:52:17,450 --> 00:52:24,150
You can't say that for sure. You know, but it's interesting, right?

472
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:31,120
The whole issue of identifying people. Right. Because even if someone doesn't provide names, you know, I think with all these you know,

473
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:36,550
with everything online, I think there's more, you know, it's like that whole, you know, how private are we?

474
00:52:36,730 --> 00:52:42,400
You know, how how private is our identity? But that's probably a whole nother class.

475
00:52:42,430 --> 00:52:49,290
Yeah, I know it's different because they're communicable diseases, but like contact tracing, like, are there guidelines that.

476
00:52:49,330 --> 00:52:56,020
There's guidelines for that? Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Can they be like applied in these situations in some cases or.

477
00:52:56,020 --> 00:52:59,679
No, I think it's like this is where this is a little bit different, you know,

478
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:02,589
because that's where and that's where some of this guidance comes from is kind of

479
00:53:02,590 --> 00:53:07,569
like looking at conditions that are highly contagious or where there is kind of,

480
00:53:07,570 --> 00:53:14,410
you know, mandatory reporting. And so I think, you know, what the feeling is here is that there should not be mandatory reporting here.

481
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:17,320
It doesn't meet that threshold of some of those guidance.

482
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:27,900
You know, but I think, as you know, as more treatments are developed and there's more that can be done,

483
00:53:28,230 --> 00:53:30,270
it'll be interesting to see how some of this changes.

484
00:53:32,670 --> 00:53:37,890
And so this is, you know, obviously, hip, hip, hip hop is what prevents us from reaching out to relatives,

485
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:42,720
even if we know that they're at risk and that it's really in the patient's hands.

486
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:47,900
And that's where what we do in genetics, too, is we'll give the patient, you know, like family letters.

487
00:53:47,910 --> 00:53:51,960
So kind of make it easy for them, make a letter that they can send to family members at risk.

488
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:54,660
But it's really up to them to do that.

489
00:53:58,270 --> 00:54:03,700
And you know, it makes me wonder about all this, you know, in terms of, you know, you go back and think about hip a hip a hip hop.

490
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:09,970
At the same time, people are putting up, you know, private information or the medical information on Facebook,

491
00:54:10,450 --> 00:54:15,100
you know, and so are some of these standards, you know, from an older generation.

492
00:54:15,430 --> 00:54:18,700
What do younger you know, what does your generation think about this?

493
00:54:19,570 --> 00:54:23,920
Should there just be more free, you know, sharing of information, free access of information.

494
00:54:24,670 --> 00:54:28,180
So these are all kind of areas that really are still being worked out.

495
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:36,100
As you can see here on the slide, I just think there are a number of issues that we're not going to get into that

496
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:40,270
are raised by doing prenatal testing and pre-implantation genetic diagnosis.

497
00:54:42,210 --> 00:54:45,430
And certainly a lot that centers, too, around disabilities.

498
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:51,540
You know, I was interested in what you kind of shared about your work with individuals with disabilities and,

499
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:56,400
you know, just the resources that are needed to to care for a child with with disabilities.

500
00:54:57,360 --> 00:55:05,100
And then it's interesting, too, is what is a disability versus what is considered maybe just a range in abilities.

501
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:12,629
And and so I think that the that the deaf community is one example where, you know,

502
00:55:12,630 --> 00:55:18,780
we've seen some patients that because of the history of deafness in their family would would want to,

503
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:24,390
you know, potentially conceive a pregnancy that would not be at risk for versus others that may.

504
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:39,690
So turning to genomic sequencing, we talked last time how genomic sequencing is is becoming more of a first tier test and use in health care.

505
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:48,360
And that, you know, but the challenges are is that not only are you going to be able to search for the condition of interest,

506
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:56,040
but also that you could identify other other gene changes that are not the reason why testing was done.

507
00:55:56,850 --> 00:56:04,290
And so this is very different than, you know, doing an X-ray and incidentally, you know, finding a mass in a chest,

508
00:56:04,290 --> 00:56:11,790
for example, because for the secondary findings, you really have to interpret the DNA sequence that you have.

509
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:16,480
So it takes some effort. It's not like it's right there in front of you what the gene changes are.

510
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:24,060
It's just that the ability is there. And so, for example, you know, here's Angelina Jolie and I'm just putting up here.

511
00:56:24,090 --> 00:56:25,499
This is not her history at all.

512
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:31,650
But just to kind of help you think about it, she was getting tested to find out if she had a gene change for breast cancer.

513
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:40,140
But what if it turns out she has gene changes for malignant hyperthermia, Alzheimer's disease and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy?

514
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:48,030
So is there an obligation to disclose some of those, or I should say all of them?

515
00:56:48,030 --> 00:56:58,120
Some of them or just the breast cancer? So what secondary results should be disclosed?

516
00:56:58,150 --> 00:57:08,400
All None. Some. And you should decide. What are your thoughts?

517
00:57:14,410 --> 00:57:18,010
Is this the lab decision against what gets disclosed as a clinician?

518
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:23,090
Is it the patient and is it ultimately the patient?

519
00:57:23,110 --> 00:57:26,620
You know, the clinician can say, hey, we can get the results for all of this stuff.

520
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:29,860
Which ones would you want to know? You can.

521
00:57:37,630 --> 00:57:48,820
Because over here. I was thinking like this is where I think pre and post education of the patient is really important.

522
00:57:48,860 --> 00:57:55,610
So like I just mentioned, you should tell them what you can find and then they can choose what they want to hear.

523
00:57:55,610 --> 00:58:04,519
And then I don't know if that happens a lot where they like regret what they ask for, but just having a lot of education.

524
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:08,680
After all, I'm like what you can do and resources. Um.

525
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:10,190
Yeah, that's.

526
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:25,080
If they choose not to know for like those secondary ones, like where do those results go get Mike if they would want to know later on or like.

527
00:58:26,010 --> 00:58:29,070
Yeah. Where is that information or is that information? Right.

528
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:40,350
Very good question. Challenging, isn't it?

529
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:49,690
And then what about our ability to take in information? I think I would restrict.

530
00:58:50,990 --> 00:58:59,100
I guess, lack of a better word, the menu of diseases, the most urgent or the most deadly or the most serious?

531
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:06,419
Because if I ask a clinician and I get back like this list of entire things that I could potentially be at risk for,

532
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:12,360
I think I would be really overwhelmed. So I would want to know just the most urgent ones.

533
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:17,420
And a lot of that's evolving and changing, too, at the same time, isn't it?

534
00:59:21,770 --> 00:59:29,209
And so that I think gets to your point, right? Is that what would be the most actionable, you know, relevant probability?

535
00:59:29,210 --> 00:59:33,320
What's the most you know, how likely is it? Is there reproductive value?

536
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:37,430
And then I think, as you pointed out, to kind of patient preference for this information.

537
00:59:39,530 --> 00:59:47,660
And so I you know, I think I gave you a link to kind of like a decision aid, you know, so kind of thinking about what do what do people want to know.

538
00:59:48,740 --> 00:59:55,430
And I think it raises issues of what's treatable, what's not treatable, what's highly likely to happen, what's not.

539
00:59:57,290 --> 01:00:01,010
And so certainly, you know, evolving science, evolving ethics.

540
01:00:04,020 --> 01:00:09,780
And so the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics is the professional organization for genetics clinicians.

541
01:00:10,230 --> 01:00:15,540
So that would be kind of clinical geneticists and genetic counselors and genetic clinical genetics genetics labs.

542
01:00:16,410 --> 01:00:21,120
And so it's amazing. Now, we've had this technology for almost ten years.

543
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:34,139
And so this was the guidance that came out back in 2013 and it was actually controversial at the time because initially what they

544
01:00:34,140 --> 01:00:44,310
said is they felt that there were 56 genes that were associated with mostly hereditary cardiovascular and cancer genetic syndromes.

545
01:00:44,310 --> 01:00:49,620
So getting to your point over here about, you know, conditions that you may be able to do something about.

546
01:00:50,190 --> 01:00:56,460
And what they initially said in their guidance was that labs should actually search for these specified genes.

547
01:00:57,390 --> 01:01:01,650
They recognize it would not be the same as if you were doing a genetic test

548
01:01:01,650 --> 01:01:05,940
specifically for one of these hereditary cancer or hereditary cardiac syndromes.

549
01:01:06,660 --> 01:01:10,500
But basically it was saying that labs should actively search for these genes.

550
01:01:12,270 --> 01:01:17,700
And so they specifically in these 56 genes, they included conditions that were high penetrance,

551
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:24,389
which gets to a concept that was raised over here earlier and that they that these would be considered actionable.

552
01:01:24,390 --> 01:01:28,350
And so they did not include, you know, the conditions that we've been talking about,

553
01:01:28,350 --> 01:01:32,430
that early onset Alzheimer's disease or ALS or Huntington's disease.

554
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:41,730
And they also said that they would only disclose pathogenic so known disease causing variants or likely pathogenic variants.

555
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:46,440
And I've just put here on on the slide just the different types of results.

556
01:01:46,860 --> 01:01:51,990
And because what we see with a lot of these newer tests and then I think we talked about this last week,

557
01:01:52,260 --> 01:01:54,960
is that we can get variance of uncertain significance.

558
01:01:55,260 --> 01:02:01,200
So in other words, it's not enough evidence yet to determine whether it's disease causing or whether it's benign.

559
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:10,590
And so with this guidance, it was saying, look, you should always know that whether no matter what the indication for doing the genomic sequencing,

560
01:02:11,310 --> 01:02:17,580
patients should have to, you know, that they should get these 56 genes back, whether they want them or not.

561
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:20,970
That was what was initially said back in 2013.

562
01:02:22,170 --> 01:02:24,870
And as I mentioned, these are autosomal dominant conditions.

563
01:02:25,620 --> 01:02:30,990
So if a if it's identified in a patient, then it's a 5050 risk for their first degree relatives.

564
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:39,630
And so initially it was right that labs should report these variants regardless of patient's preference or even regardless of the patient's age.

565
01:02:41,850 --> 01:02:51,090
And so this obviously raised significant ethical issues in terms of patient autonomy and in terms of testing children.

566
01:02:52,990 --> 01:03:03,639
And so I actually was part of a commentary that was written by a group of geneticist and ethicist and legal scholars where we just said,

567
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:09,700
wait a minute, you know, kind of let's take a pause here on these recommendations and that we need to talk.

568
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:16,000
You know, so certainly one of the key issues was patient autonomy.

569
01:03:16,010 --> 01:03:21,500
And as we know, competent adult patients have an established right to refuse medical interventions.

570
01:03:22,460 --> 01:03:32,060
And so unless a patient's decision making capacities impaired or their refusal therapy is going to constitute a threat to public health,

571
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:39,980
people have the right to to refuse care. Think about that for different religious reasons and other reasons.

572
01:03:40,790 --> 01:03:46,729
So that was a key thing, is that, you know, people should have the right to be able to, you know, say, look,

573
01:03:46,730 --> 01:03:52,100
I just want to have genomic sequencing done to find out the cause of the intellectual disability in my child.

574
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:55,759
I don't want to learn about hereditary cancer syndromes or cardiac syndromes.

575
01:03:55,760 --> 01:04:02,510
I that's all I want to learn. And as you can see here, what this commentary in JAMA said is that, you know,

576
01:04:02,510 --> 01:04:06,680
if you're saying that people who get genomic sequencing have to learn these results,

577
01:04:07,100 --> 01:04:11,959
then you're giving them basically an all or none decision that they have to either agree to the more expansive

578
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:18,530
analysis or refuse the testing that they need to be able to figure out the cause of a child's disability,

579
01:04:18,530 --> 01:04:19,160
for example.

580
01:04:21,830 --> 01:04:31,610
And then in terms of testing children, as we've already been talking about, that would go contrary to the guidelines that we've discussed because,

581
01:04:32,210 --> 01:04:36,950
you know, testing children should only be done if it's going to benefit their care in childhood.

582
01:04:37,820 --> 01:04:44,330
That testing for adult onset conditions should be deferred until that child grows up and can decide whether or not to know it.

583
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:53,440
And you know, one of the arguments they had tried to make in this 2013 statement was that, well,

584
01:04:53,650 --> 01:04:58,540
if we find out that there is a hereditary cancer gene in a child that could

585
01:04:58,540 --> 01:05:02,200
benefit their parents care if the parent didn't know that they had that change.

586
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:10,049
But as you can see here, this rationale contrasts sharply with prevailing justifications of health care for children,

587
01:05:10,050 --> 01:05:13,770
in that it proposes testing a child to benefit others.

588
01:05:14,190 --> 01:05:19,379
And our society does not mandate that competent adults obtain medical information and or treatment,

589
01:05:19,380 --> 01:05:24,210
even lifesaving treatment, just because they are parents. So it doesn't go both directions.

590
01:05:28,580 --> 01:05:32,090
There were other issues with this guidance in 2013.

591
01:05:32,090 --> 01:05:34,190
And so the reason I'm pointing this out is just that, you know,

592
01:05:34,190 --> 01:05:40,700
societies can can issue guidance that can be problematic and then needs to be dialed back, which is what happened here.

593
01:05:41,630 --> 01:05:43,250
So here, you know, as I mentioned,

594
01:05:43,250 --> 01:05:50,990
that incidental or these secondary findings are not just not just incidental because they require purposeful analytic effort.

595
01:05:51,860 --> 01:05:56,270
There's also still a lack of evidence with the emerging technology.

596
01:05:57,140 --> 01:06:01,640
You know, we we know what it looks like when you screen a high, high penetrant families.

597
01:06:01,640 --> 01:06:06,800
But what about just people in the general population? So we don't know what the predictive value is.

598
01:06:06,860 --> 01:06:09,860
We don't know the spectrum of phenotypes or anything like that.

599
01:06:10,370 --> 01:06:18,050
And just that this is considered, quote, opportunistic screening, but it does not meet the stringent criteria that is set aside for screening.

600
01:06:19,650 --> 01:06:25,979
And so many of the genes, too, were recently identified and again studied in symptomatic patients.

601
01:06:25,980 --> 01:06:30,510
So we really don't know what it looks like in people that are have no symptoms at all.

602
01:06:30,990 --> 01:06:37,350
And we also lack, you know, the studies on interventions and evidence that health outcomes will be improved.

603
01:06:39,980 --> 01:06:45,170
In addition, you know, when you're trying to figure out whether a gene change is pathogenic or not,

604
01:06:46,100 --> 01:06:52,819
there can also be errors in the scientific literature. And so what are you using to actually determine?

605
01:06:52,820 --> 01:06:58,610
Things are often not only the literature, but you're trying to use like computer modeling.

606
01:06:59,240 --> 01:07:04,490
But we don't right now. And we're just starting to have, I should say now, certainly ten years ago, we really didn't have this.

607
01:07:04,790 --> 01:07:11,060
But being able to conduct the functional experiments, to be able to determine whether something is pathogenic or not.

608
01:07:13,210 --> 01:07:21,250
So in other words, there's limitations of the literature. And then there's the issue, too, of of, you know, potentially what is a cost to health care?

609
01:07:22,030 --> 01:07:25,870
If you find something in an asymptomatic individual, what are you going to recommend?

610
01:07:25,910 --> 01:07:33,490
You know, and doing serial serial MRI's, for example, echocardiograms, you know, those are very costly medical tests as well.

611
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:41,600
And you certainly don't want to see people having unwarranted procedures like prophylactic mastectomy.

612
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:51,940
So as I mentioned, like with BRCA one and two mutations, that the penetrance of those in the high risk families can be up to 85%.

613
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:57,010
But there were also studies that were done just in the general population or I should say

614
01:07:57,190 --> 01:08:02,170
Ashkenazi Jewish population in Baltimore several years ago that found a lower penetrance,

615
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:05,740
found that the incidence of cancer was about 50%.

616
01:08:07,580 --> 01:08:11,120
So same gene changes, but in a lower risk population.

617
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:16,250
It wasn't 85%, it was 50%. Still, one could argue that's still a significant risk.

618
01:08:16,610 --> 01:08:25,850
But the point is, is that, you know, you have to have studies like that done to be able to understand change in prevalence and in penetrance.

619
01:08:26,900 --> 01:08:32,270
And then, as we talked about earlier, too, what about putting this information in electronic medical records?

620
01:08:32,700 --> 01:08:39,320
And, you know, it's not like you can shield, you know, just have partial results.

621
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:44,210
The labs are going to issue their full report, which will end up in a medical record.

622
01:08:45,350 --> 01:08:49,610
So to say that you're going to be able to withhold such information is going to be unrealistic.

623
01:08:52,670 --> 01:09:01,460
And so, like I mentioned in 2013, they initially had said, you know, anyone undergoing genomic sequencing needs to learn these results.

624
01:09:02,210 --> 01:09:09,230
But as you could see, then two years later, they made it possible for the guidance came out that people can opt out.

625
01:09:10,730 --> 01:09:17,060
You know, one could look at it, too, is that in some ways it was like coercing people to be tested or to learn information that they may not want.

626
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:26,240
And as you can see, they continue to update the list of actionable genes that's gone from 59 to 73.

627
01:09:26,780 --> 01:09:30,950
I think it's actually now 78. I think they added just a couple more chains in the last couple of months.

628
01:09:33,350 --> 01:09:38,010
There's several issues that have not been addressed and again, are areas of active research.

629
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:44,380
Research in the genetics community, you know, is, you know, was doing genomic sequencing.

630
01:09:44,390 --> 01:09:50,810
What are the issues raised if you do this? I don't know, on newborns, for example, or what about healthy adults?

631
01:09:52,130 --> 01:09:56,440
What about, you know, the fact that changes in interpretation over time?

632
01:09:56,450 --> 01:10:01,610
What's going to be the duty to recontact? What about including in the in the medical records?

633
01:10:03,140 --> 01:10:08,240
What about issues of data ownership? What about patents? What about if this is done in a research setting?

634
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:18,840
And so, in fact, actually, this is an article Gail Jarvik actually is a michigan grad in that she led a study here,

635
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:23,700
as you can see, or titled the article here, A Return of Genomic Results to Research Participants.

636
01:10:23,700 --> 01:10:26,010
The floor of the ceiling in the choices in between.

637
01:10:27,030 --> 01:10:32,160
And where they were saying well, maybe if you're involved in a research study and you're doing genomic sequencing,

638
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:38,430
is there an obligation to search for some of these actionable genes that the HMG has identified?

639
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:45,260
Should some of these be returned? But as you can see here,

640
01:10:45,260 --> 01:10:50,360
the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues said that they felt

641
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:55,070
that there is not a duty to look for secondary findings in research participants.

642
01:10:58,410 --> 01:11:04,020
And just when you look at research studies there, you know, there's the law called Clear,

643
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:08,729
which is the clinical laboratory improvement amendments that basically prohibits the

644
01:11:08,730 --> 01:11:14,190
return of research results unless the results were obtained in a clear certified lab.

645
01:11:22,380 --> 01:11:27,630
There was a National Academy of Sciences report in 2018, and Brian Zygmunt Fisher,

646
01:11:27,630 --> 01:11:32,760
who's on the faculty here in the School of Public Health, he was on the on the panel for this.

647
01:11:33,780 --> 01:11:43,499
And as you can see here, they kind of reported kind of 12 recommendations to take a look at issues of returning results to patients that continued,

648
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:49,800
considers the value to the participants, the risk and feasibility of return and the quality of the research lab.

649
01:11:50,490 --> 01:11:56,309
And I know I said patient, I meant participant. And so but, you know, I think what it shows, though,

650
01:11:56,310 --> 01:12:03,690
is that that blurring of the lines between someone participating in a research study and potentially getting

651
01:12:04,050 --> 01:12:10,860
that potentially learning results or that the study identifying results that could impact clinical care.

652
01:12:11,310 --> 01:12:14,940
So what is the responsibility of researchers in that setting?

653
01:12:15,390 --> 01:12:20,100
And this is something, like I say, that is very much under national discussion right now.

654
01:12:21,660 --> 01:12:24,990
And then just this whole issue is, is there a duty to recontact?

655
01:12:30,100 --> 01:12:35,229
And so I think what we're left with, too, is, you know, what our you know,

656
01:12:35,230 --> 01:12:42,940
not only what are implications in terms of potential health care, but are there potential legal obligations?

657
01:12:43,330 --> 01:12:51,110
You know what happens if someone doesn't disclose? You know, and that's why careful documentation is is really key here.

658
01:12:53,880 --> 01:13:00,480
And so there are several different studies that are out there being done to take a look at,

659
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:05,340
you know, how do how do people feel about learning genomic sequencing results?

660
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:09,900
Should this be done on healthy adults? Should this be done on newborns?

661
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:16,350
And so, for example, I included a link here if you want to look up the Baby Seat project, for example.

662
01:13:18,510 --> 01:13:22,799
There's also all of us. So this is a research study that is being done nationally.

663
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:26,290
This is being done by the National Institutes of Health and Age.

664
01:13:26,850 --> 01:13:35,070
And what they're, as I mentioned last week, is they're trying to build up a cohort of a million adults in this country,

665
01:13:35,550 --> 01:13:40,890
and they are going to start to actually return results to research participants.

666
01:13:41,700 --> 01:13:44,790
But they're offering, you know, to get to the points you raised earlier.

667
01:13:44,790 --> 01:13:48,390
They're offering genetic counseling services as part of the return of results.

668
01:13:51,230 --> 01:13:58,070
And so I hope I've convinced you in the last two classes here just that at each step there are decisions

669
01:13:58,070 --> 01:14:04,160
to make and there are potential ethical issues in terms of what the lab discloses to the clinician,

670
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:09,080
what the clinician discloses to the patient, and what the patient discloses to their relatives.

671
01:14:10,890 --> 01:14:14,610
And so next generation sequencing in the clinic. Are we ready?

672
01:14:15,660 --> 01:14:18,930
You know, it certainly has has started for sure.

673
01:14:19,260 --> 01:14:25,350
And so I'd say that we are kind of evolving policies as we're learning still about the technology.

674
01:14:26,190 --> 01:14:30,270
And I'll see if my animation works. This is something I put together like ten years ago.

675
01:14:31,020 --> 01:14:34,049
So here you go. The genomic train has already left. The station works.

676
01:14:34,050 --> 01:14:34,710
Let me go back.

677
01:14:38,690 --> 01:14:47,330
It took me like hours to make, but I told my husband and son is that it took hours to make, but each time I use it, that number of hours goes down.

678
01:14:48,020 --> 01:14:56,180
So so what Robert is trying to illustrate, and I've literally made this pretty soon after the guidance came out about genomic sequencing.

679
01:14:56,540 --> 01:15:04,999
So the whole point was to say that that that, you know, the train has left the station and that, ah, we can actually run after that train.

680
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:09,890
Train. There you go. We can hold on for dear life.

681
01:15:12,660 --> 01:15:18,040
We can ride the train. Or we can help drive that train forward.

682
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:23,110
There you go. That's it.

683
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:33,640
It's like. Brings up questions or thoughts.

684
01:15:36,190 --> 01:15:40,570
So back to the policy update comments that you made.

685
01:15:41,110 --> 01:15:45,610
I think it was 2015, 2015, where they gave the ability to opt out.

686
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:52,270
Yeah, but genes keep getting added to the list. So that's if you decide not to opt out, you're subject to an ever growing list of.

687
01:15:52,810 --> 01:15:58,060
Yeah, that's a good point. Right, because you'd have to actually that is actually a very good point.

688
01:15:58,060 --> 01:16:02,500
Is that what happens if you got tested for the 59 genes and now there's like 70 something?

689
01:16:03,070 --> 01:16:15,680
I think that that that unless you unless you asked to have the your genomic sequencing results reanalyzed, they're not going to report out of it.

690
01:16:16,270 --> 01:16:19,750
Which gets back to that whole issue of your contact and everything else.

691
01:16:24,250 --> 01:16:28,420
I mean, a lot of this, I'm going to say, you know, it's going to potentially impact your health care, right?

692
01:16:28,420 --> 01:16:32,490
Because you're in your twenties and thirties. And what the thoughts are there is that, you know,

693
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:40,900
will will genomic sequencing become this first tier test where you just do it on everyone and then you just read throughout the person's lifetime?

694
01:16:41,290 --> 01:16:46,749
So in other words, that that you might say, okay, now you're in your twenties, let's take a look at these genes are now you're in your thirties.

695
01:16:46,750 --> 01:16:51,729
Let's take a look at these genes. You know what is going to you know what's going to be the intersection between

696
01:16:51,730 --> 01:16:55,780
genomic sequencing and artificial intelligence and the ability to do this,

697
01:16:57,070 --> 01:17:05,650
you know, to be able to issue kind of medical alerts through patient portals, to say, oh, you know, you had genomic sequencing done five years ago.

698
01:17:06,100 --> 01:17:13,840
You now have a gene change, you know, for this condition. I mean, right now there's not that reanalysis happening on a regular basis.

699
01:17:14,530 --> 01:17:18,219
But what if there was enough? That's that's the potential for all this, right?

700
01:17:18,220 --> 01:17:22,660
Is that once you sequenced someone's genome, you really can keep looking at it.

701
01:17:27,730 --> 01:17:31,030
But I hope I've convinced you today. It raises a lot of ethical issues.

702
01:17:31,030 --> 01:17:34,930
And who's right, who has a right to that information? Is there a duty to warn?

703
01:17:35,320 --> 01:17:42,610
You know, what should you do with that information? So and so.

704
01:17:42,610 --> 01:17:47,470
I will make sure that your professor has the slides to send out afterwards.

705
01:17:48,850 --> 01:17:50,620
Yeah, I'll stick around if you have any questions.
