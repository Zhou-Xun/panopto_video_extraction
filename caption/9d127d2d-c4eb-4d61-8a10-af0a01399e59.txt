1
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:18,160
All right. Good afternoon, everybody. Happy Thursday. As with most class periods, I'd like to start to just kind of give us a view of where we are.

2
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:21,850
So today we're at September 8th, right? Yeah.

3
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,590
We're going to continue to dig down into exposure science.

4
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:32,649
So last time we talked about chemical hazards and for that, we've introduced the exposure sites.

5
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:38,170
Now we're going to get into more detail on the pathways and routes of exposure.

6
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:46,240
So this is more where the rubber meets the road, if you will, of how people are exposed and a lot of the nuances involved.

7
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:54,310
You know what what turns a toxic chemical being present to human exposure in potential dose?

8
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:00,469
Hopefully they quiet down eventually over there because it yeah.

9
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:04,130
It's coming through the wall. But even closer to home.

10
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:09,330
And these are very thick cinder block walls. It's impressive.

11
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:21,870
So any questions on the calendar so far? So our first assessment is and until later this month, on the 27th or the 29th, I mean,

12
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:27,780
I'll give you more information leading up to that as to what that is going to entail and.

13
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,990
Those things. So today and next week.

14
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:39,990
So basically the next three lectures are combined to slide decks.

15
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:46,830
I couldn't figure out how to chop it up into nice 80 minute chunks.

16
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:50,940
So there's a large number of slides. Don't be scared. I'm not going to try to get through all those today,

17
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:55,049
but hopefully I'll be able to over the course of today and then next Tuesday

18
00:01:55,050 --> 00:02:00,600
and next Thursday get through routes and pathways as well as risk assessment.

19
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:04,470
So today we'll start in on the roots of exposure.

20
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:13,830
Everyone good so far. Okay. Here.

21
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:20,990
Oops. All right. So we've talked about major routes of exposure already.

22
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,190
So are the ones we usually think about are inhalation, dermal and ingestion.

23
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:33,530
But we also want to keep in mind that other ways are possible depending on scenario specific conditions.

24
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:46,249
The eyes, for example, we talked about maternal the fetal passage of chemicals I mentioned last time like venom from animals.

25
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:54,230
There'll be more of an injection usually so, but those are usually more scenario specific,

26
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:58,370
whereas the top three are what we typically think of as the movement.

27
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:03,440
So we're just going to go through these and drill down a bit on the detail.

28
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:06,650
So the first one we'll talk about is inhalation exposure.

29
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:10,700
And please, if there's anything that I'm not, there's a lot to these.

30
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:14,450
And again, this is pretty important specific information.

31
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:20,990
Whether there's anything not coming through, clearly just now we can go back or slow down or whatever it takes.

32
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:25,460
So inhalation is very important.

33
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:30,469
It's in the news all the time. These are just a couple I grabbed last year.

34
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:36,020
But, you know, this time of year, there's always the wildfires and we've talked about that a little bit.

35
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,209
Inhalation exposure is a main concern.

36
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:48,230
They're household products where we're using in our everyday lives can also lead to exposure and more specifically potentially population exposure.

37
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,020
But it could be through other adults as well.

38
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:57,950
But, you know, we're talking about a lot of death and despair here, just on one slide with two, two newspaper articles.

39
00:03:58,790 --> 00:03:59,630
Those are big numbers.

40
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:07,910
And, you know, there could be some arguments and debate about the specifics of how those numbers would come to and things like that.

41
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:13,130
But I think if you're here, hopefully you'll agree that these are significant concerns.

42
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:20,360
So we've talked about the source to disease continuum and a few different types of figures.

43
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,390
This is just another way to show it.

44
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:31,100
So on the top left here we have the source and then you go through or pathway to our route of exposure and that's

45
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:38,179
where this yellow boxes that source to human pretty much then we get into the body the green and then in the red.

46
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:42,480
We're talking about early disease of. Political parties.

47
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:50,140
So we're going to be focusing again a lot of time today on the yellow part heading into that green card.

48
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:56,190
And for that pathways, there's a lot of different figures like this.

49
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:01,600
This is a good one that illustrate. So this is just one example of our source.

50
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:08,950
And in this case, it's a chemical disposal site and a lot of things can happen with this disposal.

51
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:10,450
So you have evaporation of chemicals.

52
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:18,249
You also have leaching the runoff with those chemicals very common, even in a landfill that's lined sometimes it's not lined with the right thing.

53
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:26,590
Or you might have some imperfections in the lining that could have that leaching and go beyond it.

54
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:34,390
So after it evaporates or leaches, you know, it can reach the air, soil, water and those different media.

55
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:42,440
If you phase in between those depending on the conditions involved in mechanical or chemical properties, things like that, you know,

56
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:52,180
deposition of the chemical from the atmosphere to the soil and water and evaporation from those into the air temperature and other other conditions.

57
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:58,330
Then we have our aquatic and terrestrial biota that could be contacted directly.

58
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:02,410
They might be eating something in the water, drinking water or taking in the water.

59
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:06,940
They may be putting stuff back into the water. They lose that chemical of concern.

60
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:12,430
They might be taking up and releasing the air in front of us over here.

61
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:20,800
So we have inhalation of air, obviously ingestion of food or other things just in water.

62
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:25,359
There's also dermal contact between. So this is just one example.

63
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:31,540
You could come up with a diagram like this for pretty much any different type of source or chemical scenario,

64
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:40,720
which may be helpful in thinking about how people might be exposed and what the most likely pathways could be from from source to human.

65
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:47,930
So inhalation, again, is what we're going to be talking about right now.

66
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:53,430
A lot of times it's the most critical, I would say, historically in the occupational settings.

67
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:59,059
It was pretty much assumed that you were talking about pollution if you were talking about harmful exposures,

68
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:04,370
unless it was explicitly stated otherwise. I think these days it's much more integrated.

69
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:15,380
You know, there's a lot more consideration. And the reason that was is, you know, a lot of things are put into the air through a process inhaled.

70
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:25,700
And when it goes to sampling and regulation as well, a lot of it was focused on here, as we'll see throughout course of this course.

71
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:32,480
So a lot of the occupational exposures, important information as well as more broadly ambient air.

72
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:43,100
The air right now, we're all breathing hopefully and we're all there's some sort of milieu, if you will, in the air right now.

73
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:47,690
The small. Hopefully small concentrations of various chemicals.

74
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:52,730
There's also a range of other special situations we've talked previously about showering.

75
00:07:52,970 --> 00:08:00,620
You probably think skin exposed, right? But you can also have a volatile zation of chemicals and then subsequent inhalation.

76
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:07,940
And in that scenario. And there's many others as well. So just trying to get a little bit of the importance here.

77
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:17,150
So what we want to know, we're really digging down and assessing how much exposure is what the target audience of concern is.

78
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:22,130
So again, historically, in terms of by historical perspective, occupationally,

79
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:28,610
a lot of focus on long as the top has the target over, you think asbestos, you know, things like that.

80
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:35,900
So the target or the target area is the one that exposure assessment might look quite different than if you

81
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:43,970
have other organs from the patients that are the concern that's going to impact how we go about estimating.

82
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:50,750
Knowing the mechanism of toxicity is also helpful, not always known and could be quite complex.

83
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:58,250
You know, we talk about that a lot because it's the whole studied and it has all kinds of different toxic mechanisms of toxicity.

84
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:01,200
So that's hard to just kind of focus on a point.

85
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:06,140
So but it's always good to know that because again, that could impact how you feel about the triggers or estimate.

86
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:11,660
And then another big one is physical and chemical properties of the containment.

87
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:18,980
That's going to really dictate how it behaves both in the environment around us, but also once it gets to that human interface,

88
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:27,020
how it might behave to result in greater or lower exposures and subsequent risk.

89
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:33,700
So here's a big one that is a differentiation we're going to have throughout the semester.

90
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:41,980
Even if you look at some of these lecture tables in the future, differentiating between the nature of the agent from an inflation perspective,

91
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:45,250
you have we're going to lump gases and vapors together,

92
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:53,380
and that has its own set of rules and considerations compared to these bottom bullet aerosols for particulate matter.

93
00:09:55,660 --> 00:10:01,540
So keep that in mind. I try to differentiate throughout and point out where things do.

94
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:07,750
Diverge when thinking about and measuring these two different basic types.

95
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:13,480
So when we're talking about gases and vapors and principle, we're thinking once you do that,

96
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:21,550
it sort of mixes in with your entire respiratory system because such small molecules think that you will ever.

97
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:28,840
And then from there, the chemical properties of that gas are people will determine what happens to it.

98
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:36,820
Does it just stay around or does it just impact once or is it absorbed and circulated throughout the body to impact other parts?

99
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:41,140
So that's one group. The other group is aerosols.

100
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:45,459
So this is the suspension of a liquid or a solid or a gas. It's a liquid.

101
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:49,240
We tend to call it a mist as solid as particulate matter.

102
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:54,100
A few. Things like that. And we'll get to definitions in a bit here.

103
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:59,290
So here, in addition to the chemical properties that we've talked about with gas and vapors,

104
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:02,380
we also have to think about the physical properties of that aerosol,

105
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:09,879
very important with regards to how it's going to interact with the body deposit and or its orbit.

106
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:20,180
So. So important distinction here. So back to needing to know the target women of interest.

107
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:26,900
So there are a lot of chemical agents where one is an organ of interest.

108
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:35,629
So we have a lot of corrosive oxidants, irritants, and just because they're on the list doesn't mean they won't show up on another place.

109
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:39,550
Right. This might be just one of many concerns, but there are some.

110
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:52,080
We also have sensitization. We'll talk more about that in a moment. So we heard of occupational asthma or chemical, chemical sensitivity.

111
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:59,010
Think like that. That's what we're talking about with sensitization, pneumoconiosis agents.

112
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:04,110
And we know what that means. Work on the other.

113
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:11,670
Performances. So that's where you have you know,

114
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:17,820
you have examples in Arizona particular of some sort of particular that gets in the lungs and

115
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:24,480
gets trapped there and starts to form fibrosis and you lose the elasticity of the lungs,

116
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:30,020
ability to exchange oxygen and eventually chemically usually fit.

117
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:37,140
So it's it's those and separately, things like asbestos and silica mentioned last time could also be carcinogens.

118
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:43,100
So. A few different types of mechanisms there, the world specifically.

119
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:51,290
So when we assess these are approaches to measuring and estimating exposure might differ than if we're concerned with systemic.

120
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:59,079
Health effects. Just some more textbook tables.

121
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:03,280
Again, these lists are in place anywhere with with Google search, I'm sure.

122
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:10,120
But here in this example, just a partial listing of chemicals on the left and then on the right,

123
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:16,390
a brief description of the chemical properties that are related to their respiratory effects.

124
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:28,290
And then what part of the respiratory system are. So you have out-of-place awesome oxidizer irritants, whether they're soluble or not,

125
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:34,740
can can determine how and where those those effects are going to be felt.

126
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:39,750
Upper and lower airways. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.

127
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:44,440
That means. The ones really struggling to keep it.

128
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:52,840
So again, just a just an example. Yeah.

129
00:13:53,030 --> 00:14:01,790
Do you see a broad listing of different types of things, you know, gases up at the top there, a wide range of things that you have touched already.

130
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:05,960
But you know something? You might find an indoor air sometimes.

131
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:17,229
I saw something, as we mentioned an example last night, you have some of these more ambient air pollutants, nitrogen oxides, soot from outside.

132
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:22,310
It goes on the metals as well.

133
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:27,820
We touched on metal film Fever last time. And while there's.

134
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:35,220
For example. So that's different types of effects.

135
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:38,850
You're getting more in to that sensitization mission.

136
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,330
Occupational asthma. Here's just another table of examples.

137
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:50,220
So you'll see a two thirds in this table or maybe even more are more like biologically derived agents

138
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:56,520
being more likely to have those contain antigens that the body is going to respond to as proteins.

139
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:01,000
Right. But down here you get pharmaceuticals and there's metals.

140
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:05,640
You see pesky, pesky metals very useful.

141
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:13,050
And we use them for so many things, but it's not controlled correctly, can result in a lot of adverse outcomes.

142
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:23,880
So again, this is artificial asthma where you're exposed and sensitized for longer term chronic disease of the airways.

143
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:32,229
So that's some examples of what the target audience would have.

144
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:36,160
The target audience, not the lungs, but we're talking about inhalation exposures.

145
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:44,230
Then we're interested in not really being present solely, but also what's being absorbed by the body.

146
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:51,590
So. And for that it has to enter the bloodstream and then be distributed to the target individuals.

147
00:15:53,150 --> 00:16:01,820
So let's see. You may think of an example of something you might prevent that would not necessarily be the ones that would be the primary concern.

148
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:11,940
Ethanol. You know, talking to CNN, it's probably right.

149
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:15,510
Central nervous system effects, macular degeneration. Yeah.

150
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,240
Yeah. So, yeah, there's tons of.

151
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:27,799
Pesticides, but are two prime examples I like to use for systemic things where you can have other relative exposure as well.

152
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:38,310
But information is done. So usually there's different ways it can be absorbed into the body.

153
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:44,970
But, you know, if it's a small molecule, it might do so by entering the alveoli.

154
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:49,710
And then that gas exchange region belongs to the bloodstream.

155
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:51,750
Other sites are also possible,

156
00:16:51,750 --> 00:17:02,130
so larger particles you might end up swallowing or other mechanisms that have that contact between various layers in the bloodstream.

157
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:07,800
And again, the chemical makeup, the chemical properties are also important to consider.

158
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:19,840
This is a really old textbook picture and it sits there waves.

159
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:25,030
But I think it's similar sentiments across the airways.

160
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:30,250
But anyway, so we have just here the trachea.

161
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,820
You have your mouth and nose, you have the trachea, then you have a bunch of branching right off your airways as well as your blood vessels.

162
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:40,149
And it's a branching, branching, branching.

163
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:50,470
And this is zooming in this tiny rectangle here, zooming in greatly to these tiny alveolar sacks which are surrounded by these capillaries.

164
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:54,410
And this is where that gas exchange region is bringing the hair into these sacks.

165
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:58,090
They fill up and you have the blood flowing through these capillaries.

166
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:02,680
They're pulling out the oxygen and putting in the carbon dioxide.

167
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:07,690
That then gets exhaled, actually takes up. Distributes through the body.

168
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:10,810
So pretty amazing that is occurring all the time.

169
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:18,810
Crazy. Just another zoomed in version of the ambulance with the red blood cell.

170
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:24,180
You have the fusion. So the fusion usually is based on high concentration and low concentration.

171
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:28,470
So that's how the action gets into the red blood cells have lower content.

172
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:33,000
They're infused with oxygen. The carbon dioxide.

173
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:40,090
Does that contact occurs? And again, this is very, very deep into that.

174
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:48,140
Okay. So that's some of the basics. Any questions thus far? Joining too much into the physiology here.

175
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:58,569
But it is important to consider. So you might recall this or some derivation of this from previous lectures.

176
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:02,770
So this is our inhalation dose estimate.

177
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:12,340
So average daily dose is one way we might be of an exposure or dose estimate for various purposes toxicology risk assessment,

178
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:16,270
risk management, epidemiology, whatever it might be.

179
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:19,840
So your units or how it's presented might differ, as we talked about.

180
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:23,770
But here is one of the basic points where you have your average daily dose equals

181
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:29,710
your concentration of the contaminant theory deletion rate in volume per time,

182
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:34,060
times the duration of days example here.

183
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:40,840
And then sometimes you might involve the body weight, but sometimes I'm not for risk assessment.

184
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:44,560
All the times they can express that on terms of the body weight.

185
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:53,249
And then you have this capital here, as we talked about in that example from the second lecture, it's kind of a curve ball what we did.

186
00:19:53,250 --> 00:20:00,460
We consider that the bioavailability, your Kaplan Dose, but it is a very important factor to consider,

187
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,230
particularly when we're talking about systemic effects. Right.

188
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:10,390
Okay. So with that in mind, where do we get some of this information?

189
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:16,000
So we've talked about inhalation rate and the EPA exposures again, book.

190
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:21,690
And this is available. I have links throughout the course to this.

191
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:26,589
So again, you have various different things you can get at for this.

192
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:35,630
We're interested in innovation. And you'll see, as with most things, EPA is super user friendly.

193
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:39,890
I'm just kidding. You may have worked at EPA.

194
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:47,990
I understand. I'm just joking, but their website is always a couple of months anyway.

195
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:52,430
So this is just a list of the different tables that they include here.

196
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:59,540
And then they have a whole host of studies that they base their exposure factor tables on.

197
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:03,670
So very useful. Reference.

198
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:10,240
So we'll usually start with a basic table and the further down you scroll these documents a much more

199
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:17,080
detailed tables depending on if you want access to different types of information that to that topic.

200
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:26,830
So here we have our age groups. I mean and as we talked about, you might want other distribution of other points on the distribution.

201
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:36,960
Four years ago. So again, just a reminder that that inhalation rate, that's a common source that you could measure it as well.

202
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,200
Various various ways to do that.

203
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:49,020
So, again, just trying to fill out that equation for the average daily dose, so at least creates one big factor there.

204
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:54,990
Thought about taking this one out. There's some random professor previous.

205
00:21:55,650 --> 00:22:00,870
My kids are younger. I think they consented to this for some reason.

206
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:10,380
But this is just to illustrate, you know, among that table will say, create over £200.

207
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:15,690
You know, when my kids were little, you're talking, you know, eight times,

208
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:23,700
eight times bigger, but, you know, only maybe two or three times more, thereby being taken.

209
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:29,640
And so the point here and another theme throughout is susceptible populations, children being they one.

210
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:39,000
This is just one aspect that makes them at higher risk is that when we talk about inflation, they have greater take rate per body weight.

211
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:45,270
So when we talk about that ADT, the average daily dose, that body weight factor,

212
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:51,930
children are much more susceptible in that manner, in addition to a lot of other reasons.

213
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:57,780
We'll continue to touch. Okay.

214
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:04,830
So we had to integrate the years that pesky bioavailability down here.

215
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:10,620
How do we do that? This is where it gets. You can get kind of complicated.

216
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:20,910
So for biofilm belief, we work on things that make it all the way to the respiratory region, the alveoli, what scientists assume to be 100%.

217
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:27,360
And there's a couple reasons. One is it's very hard to test right now.

218
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:31,560
It's easy to have it wrong that you can test to see how much gets exchanged.

219
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:37,200
There are other experimental methods for doing that, but sometimes forces are present.

220
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:41,430
Also, if you're doing a calculation like this, if you're trying to be as.

221
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:49,440
Also conservative is possible for protective. So you might want to overestimate that by bioavailability, right?

222
00:23:49,440 --> 00:24:00,060
To just be on the safe side. So for things like gas in the papers, a lot of times they might assume, however, you know,

223
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:04,769
of that volume you're bringing in, not all that's making it that deep into the lungs.

224
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:07,830
Right. You have this form of the trachea and some other.

225
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:16,920
Compartments that basically don't interact with the blood as much and can be just exhaled out.

226
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:22,770
So. It's about 3% of the business very much.

227
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:27,330
So that's one thing you could potentially consider, depending on how detailed you want to be in your assessment.

228
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:36,510
And then, you know, for some places or other volatile compounds, that depends on that exposure, that gradient.

229
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:40,590
If it's if it's saturated anymore. So there are some nuances there.

230
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:44,790
So, again, this might be for a more detailed assessment than we might typically need.

231
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:50,130
But some things to consider, there's other determinants of uptake as well.

232
00:24:53,240 --> 00:25:02,510
And that's based on some of these. Properties, sulfur, gas, gases.

233
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:10,800
You have solubility and chemical reactivity. Very important in how it interacts with the tissues there.

234
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:19,120
And that's going to vary based on the location. That's true for gas.

235
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:22,770
It's meant for particulates. We'll talk about how big the particles are.

236
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:29,850
Very important for where it's going to end up in the in your system and then what happens

237
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:39,360
to it so that whether it's also susceptible to its mechanisms before it gets absorbed.

238
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:51,460
So a lot to consider. And that's what this is referring to, those that are targeting one, but could also be important, of course, for systemic.

239
00:25:56,070 --> 00:26:00,120
So in the lungs we have the four layers of resistance uptake.

240
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:03,480
All these might impact how much of that gets absorbed.

241
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:11,940
Again, you can you can keep diving deeper and deeper and deeper into any one of these aspects and lose yourself for probably an entire career.

242
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:17,600
So just try not to get off on a tangent, but just know of the complexities here and a lot of these people,

243
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:24,750
and that's what they need to get into for our purposes. But just want to acknowledge that what they're there to in the air layer,

244
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:30,420
liquid layer, tissue layer upon layer, it's the overall mass transfer coefficient.

245
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:35,790
How much is getting from the air to the bloodstream is going to be related to the solubility coefficient

246
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:43,590
at each of those layers diffusivity of each layer and might be related to temperature as well.

247
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:49,680
Again. So this is very hard to measure. So this is likely not available for a lot of contaminants.

248
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:55,950
But in the event you can track down this information, this well, the types of things you want.

249
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:04,080
Then you could look at the area, surface area below and then the partial pressures.

250
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:10,890
How much of that is going to diffuse from high to low concentration to and from this to?

251
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:16,390
So this is a very detailed slide. Again, a lot of times we're not going to get to this level of detail.

252
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:20,410
But again, we just want to acknowledge all the possibilities.

253
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:25,630
So a rule of thumb here, although not always.

254
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:34,180
Even if you scroll back to that textbook table, as I showed earlier in this lecture, water soluble.

255
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:40,630
So chemicals that are highly water soluble, generally you're going to see upper respiratory tract.

256
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:46,640
Effects because it's being absorbed.

257
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:51,590
Because it is water soluble. It's more readily absorbed into. Body tissues.

258
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:55,399
You see that? And what that results in is good morning practice.

259
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:59,540
So you start to get irritated, you know, your nose, mouth, upper throat.

260
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:06,710
Which which sucks, right? But it tells you that you're probably being exposed to something that your body doesn't like.

261
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:12,210
If you have low water soluble chemicals, they're not going to be absorbed up there.

262
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:15,720
And you might not even have any more properties you don't know.

263
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:20,980
You know, your body's not give you a warning signal and they might be getting deep into the lungs, you know?

264
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:28,290
You know, so those are important properties, but could be highly dangerous, both short and long term for that reason.

265
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:32,159
Again, this is just a general rule of thumb. It's typically thought of this way.

266
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:36,210
But for every kind of course, there are a couple of issues.

267
00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:45,260
This is just a figured kind of difficult to slide to.

268
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:51,350
Those different layers of your air layer liquid or you can so you layer tissue and blood.

269
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:56,660
This is how much agent is available.

270
00:28:56,990 --> 00:29:04,740
So you have your air so the reactive can pull. Is is getting absorbed more in that liquid layer.

271
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,690
In those morning properties, you're going to feel it.

272
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:13,379
The upper airways more likely because of that quick reactive ability in those layers and you have

273
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:20,770
less available at the tissue reservoir of the remote control and water soluble forewarning,

274
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:26,160
warning properties. You're not going to see those early signals. There might be more available for the tissue to do damage.

275
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:31,000
So, again, just a. Graphic depiction of one of two slides.

276
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:38,590
Three questions. They quieted down next door.

277
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:43,209
Do they leave? He's not going to class. Okay.

278
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:46,690
So this is an important slide here. You know what I mean?

279
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:52,600
Types of aerosols and their definitions. So.

280
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:58,700
Again, this is one of those points where people can deflate or confuse the terms they used.

281
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:02,269
They use no setting and it's not no fault of their own.

282
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:07,160
But there are actual differences between some of these that might be used interchangeably when they should be.

283
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:11,330
You know, you've probably heard people talk about Fuze just kind of.

284
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:20,190
Broadly put, it actually in our field has a very distinct definition of where they might actually need paper to write.

285
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:23,849
So we have types of aerosol.

286
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:30,620
So again, we have our guest in the papers. This is aerosols, dust, fibers, smoke.

287
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:34,800
A few mist are the big ones of fog and smog.

288
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:42,520
So dust is defined as like pieces of earth or other matter, small enough to be suspended.

289
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:49,940
So. As an aerosol has to be aerosolized or suspended.

290
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:53,730
So that's our dust. A fiber is similar, except it's going to be long skinny.

291
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,990
So that's what we mean by aspect ratio of its planes.

292
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:03,650
Divide by width of at least three so as to be at least three times longer than as wide to to be considered fiber.

293
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:10,010
And these have their own distinct things that they might do, both environmentally and biologically.

294
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:18,110
So asbestos, the fact that it is a fiber is part of why it's important to get the physical properties of it.

295
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:30,690
Because it can aerodynamically, because it's not very wide yet aerodynamically into the alveoli, because it looks small from that direction.

296
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:36,500
And then if you try to breathe it back out of my watch, it's just gonna simplify things for you.

297
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:43,200
So. That's where fiber research a different how we measure them as well as particular.

298
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:50,379
So that's fighter. The smoke is. I guess you don't smoke.

299
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:57,590
It's produced from kind of combustion of organic matter, so. Fire a few.

300
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:01,040
So this is where it's a lot of people misuse this term.

301
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:08,090
So for our purposes, it's a fairly spherical, solid particle produced from condensation of a very, very gaseous combustion product.

302
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:13,590
So it's actually a solid. So in our purposes, it's a lot of times to refuse to.

303
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:17,780
It are used in reference to hot work like welding brazing.

304
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:26,080
Torch cutting produces a metal. It's actually a solo, particularly this is very, very small.

305
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:30,320
So it looks like the smoke and there is smoke you've seen mixed in there as well.

306
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,230
Mixtures of liquid particles formed.

307
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:46,110
Conversation minimization. Let's work with this again with metals, with metal working.

308
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:50,110
If they you know, if you're cutting metal, if you're spending it on a lead or something.

309
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:53,129
It gets really hot to the point price.

310
00:32:53,130 --> 00:33:01,050
You use a lot of cutting fluids or working clothes, and those can generate this because it's used in the high energy process.

311
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:09,730
It can be broken up into very small particles. You also get missed environmental waves because there's a lot of.

312
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:11,740
She was.

313
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:25,720
She comes back feeling like I'm just going to Falcon is a visible mist and a smog is a fog mixed with smoke plus other photochemical reaction.

314
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:35,440
Of course, you'll think of Los Angeles and other large cities that have the topography that can travel.

315
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:41,440
So any questions on this? I just kind of wanted to get that out there.

316
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:45,280
Harris. Yeah, I guess we're following this sort of what?

317
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:53,680
Why is it possible? So I think that's a great meteorological question.

318
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:00,610
So, you know, and we talk about occupational and a lot of exposure stuff.

319
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:02,469
We usually you're talking about a missed fog.

320
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:11,209
I usually use more environmentally or meteorological you to think of when you're driving in the morning, like this time of year,

321
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:16,180
certain times of year, to have certain dew point conditions and things like that, you get that possibility.

322
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:21,380
But I don't know has to do with what was climate. Consideration.

323
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:29,780
The lighting and everything else. Anybody else doing for them as a unit like gun industry really refers to this

324
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:33,890
like psychometric chart to kind of look at some of the properties like I've and.

325
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:37,660
Okay. Thank you. So.

326
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:45,080
So for our purposes, we tend to focus on. But it's good to know.

327
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:46,570
What's the bottom to?

328
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:58,780
We're continuing on with Aerosoles talking about how important that size, that aerosoles we usually refer to those as a diameter.

329
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:02,840
Just the most basic property means to to look at them.

330
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:12,509
So this is. Typical histogram you might see from any aerosol concern.

331
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:17,430
You take a measurement and try to distribute the particles by size and you get

332
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:22,230
this and you to know what kind of distribution you might describe this is.

333
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:29,030
Just tax credit like to the rate skewed also known as.

334
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:37,310
Sometimes when a ship like this. It is you tomorrow?

335
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:42,530
Yeah, it's the one that they're all bunched up and left side like this.

336
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:53,480
A lot of times we call this a lot of normal distribution, which we is the one option to help us describe it, you know, to do statistics on it.

337
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:59,120
So an environmental health sciences like global distribution, we see it all over the place,

338
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:03,530
a lot of different applications, one of those being particle size distributions.

339
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:11,180
It's very common for that. Of course, you have applications like nano manufacturing nanoparticles where they're all small form size or something.

340
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:21,230
But, you know, for something that involves dust fumes, a lot of times you'll see something that approximates that, like normal distribution.

341
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:27,740
We have it. Skewed right tail retail speed.

342
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:30,810
Right. And you see those bunched up for fall.

343
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:36,360
We'll see this again when we talk about other things like concentrations of contaminants.

344
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:47,920
That's good to know. So what happens when you take the log of all those diameters or plotted on the log scale, you get that nice bell curve, right?

345
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:54,050
That Gaussian distribution. And that's what you can do a lot of statistics with with that on now.

346
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:57,670
So we'll come back to that later in the semester.

347
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:05,550
But just wanted to touch on that here briefly to show you that in our field, the viral distribution is very prominent.

348
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:12,370
So getting comfortable working with it is a good thing to. All right.

349
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:19,190
So we talked about different types of aerosols and how important that size is with the aerosol for diameter.

350
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:28,120
Here are some examples of where that might fly on various types of cells.

351
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:33,830
So there's our fog and our mist. Raindrops.

352
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:38,299
Here's our beach sand that we determined we weren't really that concerned with.

353
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:43,850
Last time tobacco smoke told us Poland's.

354
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:50,630
It's pretty certain times a year that becomes an issue, but that's where they tend to reside.

355
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:55,500
Plant spores. Carbon black is very small.

356
00:37:56,070 --> 00:38:04,750
Again, that's going to determine. Dictate kind of how toxic the coal dust the last couple of years.

357
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:07,980
A lot of interest there. Viruses, they are quite small.

358
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:11,050
So anybody know off top your head where.

359
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:17,320
What we're interested in primarily the lower gas exchange region.

360
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:21,560
On this. What we tend to think about.

361
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:27,370
Big. All right.

362
00:38:27,370 --> 00:38:37,720
I can teach you that. So usually, depending on where you look for micrometers, this is considered a cut off for rest purple.

363
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:42,389
Particulate matter. Is that right here?

364
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:44,250
So you're getting, you know,

365
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:51,570
pollens probably aren't going to make it down to the alveoli but but viruses bacteria might of course smokes carbon black.

366
00:38:53,930 --> 00:39:01,580
Another dust might be somewhere in between. So, like this last one I showed, these ones down here are going to look old,

367
00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:07,540
behave a lot more differently in an interaction with European Airways than the big.

368
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:24,399
Okay. So factors governing aerosol behavior, the air dynamics above that of the aerosol determines behavior.

369
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,700
And it's very important for two primary purposes.

370
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:36,970
One is where it's going to deposit in the respiratory tract again, if you're interested in lung damage or systemic effects.

371
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:41,110
And then also later in the specimen, we start talking about how do I measure these?

372
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:49,360
They design samplers with this in mind as well to be able to efficiently capture the right size distributions and.

373
00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:59,360
So that's why this is important. And the way it happens, the different forces that act on their soil to cause.

374
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:07,600
Deposition or gravitational. So that's just simply the particles big and heavy enough.

375
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:12,710
It just settles down due to gravity. The next one is an inertial.

376
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:18,090
Impaction is a big one. You talk about both in walking and with sampling.

377
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:23,620
Of Arizona's interceptions also possible some concept.

378
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:28,900
Then you have the fusion. That's for a much, much smaller purpose.

379
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:32,890
So these top three are the most important, the long deposition.

380
00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:42,990
And then for sampling and even reducing or controlling aerosols, you get into some electrostatic or thermal.

381
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:49,160
Applications that can capitalize on those properties to do.

382
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:53,620
To either capture or simply. So it's a wish.

383
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:59,720
So the three and four furlongs. We're interested in these top three gravitational inertial fusion.

384
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:06,800
Okay. Here's our airwaves again, more of a hand-drawn sketch,

385
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:14,560
but so we'll talk about three main reasons to think about aerosols and where they might deposit.

386
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:22,550
And there's different terms attached to it. So in the head and throat area, we call that the nasal parent geo region.

387
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:35,480
And anything that deposits there can they can make it that far in your respiratory system is called inhalable particulate or inhalable aerosol.

388
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:39,110
So we're used to talking about 100 micrometers or less.

389
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:46,040
And more than anything, more than a hundred micrometers might be so heavy that it's hard to even breathe in unless you're,

390
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:52,550
you know, facing up toward the source or something starts being a projectile into your face or something.

391
00:41:52,740 --> 00:42:03,380
So, so it's nasal pharyngeal region and then the smaller particles might then further progress to what we call the tracheal bronchial region,

392
00:42:04,010 --> 00:42:09,680
also known as the thoracic region. That was the other part of the ones.

393
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:14,870
So that's actually less than about ten. I have a slide.

394
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:27,360
A future slide denotes the. Diamond cut off its root, and then if it makes it smaller to go past that, it gets to what we call the gas exchange each.

395
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:31,639
That's the how we go about. And that's also term.

396
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:36,260
Russ Feingold is going to talk about Russ Feingold, particularly at risk for aerosols.

397
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:40,100
We're talking about those that are small enough to get down to that gas exchange region.

398
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:45,470
Again, we're talking typically considered things for Michael Hirsh for small.

399
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:57,610
Airway branching. So. Just to give you a sense of scale.

400
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:04,540
So you have the one trachea and they branch to the bronchial bronchi for the branch bronchioles.

401
00:43:04,930 --> 00:43:10,930
Some stop and some keep going into the respiratory bronchioles that continue to branch until you get to,

402
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:14,680
you know, roughly 8 million of those populous.

403
00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:19,930
So a lot of branching. So we try to do the math on how many branches.

404
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:27,700
It takes to get to that number. But we're talking on a large, large scale, a very, very tiny.

405
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:36,160
So going back to those deposition mechanisms that we talked about.

406
00:43:37,470 --> 00:43:40,500
This is just an illustration of those various methods.

407
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:47,430
So one is interceptions and we talk about those branches, a particle that is runs into a branch,

408
00:43:47,430 --> 00:43:53,970
something that's way like the football term just gets intercepted and it's going to stop there.

409
00:43:54,180 --> 00:44:03,540
Right. And from there, it might be cleared through clearance mechanisms or it all depends.

410
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:10,679
So it's interception and the big one is impaction. So this is similar interception, except it's not running directly into something.

411
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:14,070
That's what it's where. It's more to the wall.

412
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:23,340
So when you have a change in direction of that air flow and smaller particles are able to

413
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:27,360
move with that change in direction of air flow much more easily than a larger particle.

414
00:44:28,050 --> 00:44:34,020
So the higher the velocity, the greater that the change in direction.

415
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:41,470
The smaller and smaller part just might impact. Let's stop there and we'll get much more into impact when we talk about sampling.

416
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:46,400
It's used extensively there, and we sampled her results.

417
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:55,600
But it's also an important deposition mechanism. Again that's going to be here in larger particles, very, very small ones.

418
00:44:55,610 --> 00:45:00,440
They're going to be able to maneuver through those branches, through those changes and erode time, your direction.

419
00:45:02,310 --> 00:45:07,620
And that's where I should start here. So gravitational is going to impact even larger particles.

420
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,520
Where. You know, that gravitational.

421
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:16,700
So that's going to be the big part, of course, where, you know, despite the airflow, they're going to still drop out.

422
00:45:17,810 --> 00:45:21,320
So large particles that family as well, of course.

423
00:45:22,850 --> 00:45:28,760
And then the last one is for the tiny particles. It's terms Brownian diffusion,

424
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:40,120
which is that random motion that you get with these tiny particles that some will impact and some will interact with the walls and some of it's ram,

425
00:45:40,130 --> 00:45:46,250
it's kind of random diffusion. Again, the concentration gradient plays a role in that.

426
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:49,820
But that's for the small ones. And this is representing the alveolar sac.

427
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:56,210
But how big, very tiny particles might be deposited there versus being brought back up?

428
00:45:58,490 --> 00:46:04,900
Questions on the. Okay. Told you what info today.

429
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:10,360
Okay. Respiratory tract deposition. So.

430
00:46:13,110 --> 00:46:17,280
Partial deposition throughout this. Airway.

431
00:46:17,990 --> 00:46:28,040
The respiratory system against can depend on the concentration of the temple of interest, that particle size distribution that we talk about.

432
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:31,920
It's huge, but also duration of exposure, the rate of ventilation.

433
00:46:31,930 --> 00:46:35,130
So the velocity of the air is going to.

434
00:46:35,930 --> 00:46:40,610
Change the way things like deposit Toyota evolve their breed.

435
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:44,720
Volume one's nose versus mouth breathing.

436
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:48,710
Come back to that size distribution.

437
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:56,160
Terminal of a lot of things ultimately affect how it's clear things like that.

438
00:46:57,450 --> 00:47:02,610
So only a fraction of countries, all in the alveolar polar regions actually the positive.

439
00:47:03,270 --> 00:47:09,160
So again, that's sort of a different. Conceptual assumption that what we talk about with guests the papers.

440
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:18,050
You're assuming a lot of times it's 100% or if you account for that dense base, maybe 70%.

441
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:28,970
So not everything is deposited. So this is a graph where I always kind of have to look at it for a minute to get myself on the right page.

442
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:33,680
So on the bottom for the x axis, again, we have the diameter of the particle.

443
00:47:34,730 --> 00:47:39,110
So our four micrometers is right here.

444
00:47:40,370 --> 00:47:42,829
The y axis is deposition fraction.

445
00:47:42,830 --> 00:47:52,100
So between zero and one, how much is being deposited in the airways and then the different curves of the different regions that we defined earlier.

446
00:47:53,150 --> 00:47:56,780
So this is for breathing through the nose.

447
00:47:57,470 --> 00:48:03,290
See the very small particles. You might get some nasal deposition from that diffusion.

448
00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:08,320
And that's important down here as well in.

449
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:16,740
Large particles they're going to impact. So different deposition mechanisms.

450
00:48:17,010 --> 00:48:24,210
Again, as you go along this X axis for a particular point, that's why these curves, they're not straight lines.

451
00:48:25,930 --> 00:48:34,660
Trachea. Triguboff goes up here and there are pulmonary alveolar so that again, there's like for some above for me to get me through there.

452
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:39,280
But we're talking about averages and things like that.

453
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:45,320
And then. Okay, so that's nose breathing.

454
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:59,540
And so you think you're getting quite a bit of breath back up at that 48.3 magnitude and that's something we'll come back to in the semester.

455
00:49:00,950 --> 00:49:06,910
Point three is a big number for aerosols. As do HEPA filters, all kinds of stuff.

456
00:49:09,370 --> 00:49:18,700
So this is all breathing. So let's go back to the whole intense interested in that, the alveolar respiratoire deposition.

457
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:24,880
So, you know, it's breathing. It's about point, the peak. It's about point three or 30%.

458
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:30,280
With North Korea, it's up to 65%. So another reason not to do your mouth breathing, I guess.

459
00:49:30,970 --> 00:49:35,560
But, you know, when you're sleeping, I suppose control it or have he exercise?

460
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:40,090
There's times when public health care is required.

461
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:47,650
And yeah, it's not getting the same types of arteries for impaction.

462
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:52,410
Or some of those other mechanisms that those pretty. To help filter out.

463
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:58,130
So just an illustrative example of some of the differences that are.

464
00:49:59,090 --> 00:50:06,170
His first deposition in the various places within the airwaves, airways and different modes of breathing.

465
00:50:10,110 --> 00:50:15,800
Okay. So here we're talking about a summary swimmer, aerodynamic diameter.

466
00:50:17,730 --> 00:50:20,850
We'll come back to that later in the semester as well. What that means.

467
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:28,890
That's just a summary measure for a precise distribution that sort of accounts for density and other things.

468
00:50:29,550 --> 00:50:37,860
But we have ten micrometres. As a parent, you primarily impaction as our deposition mechanism between five and ten is apparent

469
00:50:38,070 --> 00:50:43,920
and tracheal bronchial or thoracic impaction as well as some sedimentation.

470
00:50:45,110 --> 00:50:50,210
Gravitation. 3 to 5. Take your Bronco gas exchange region.

471
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:56,150
Sedimentation is big. And then gas exchange region 1 to 3.

472
00:50:56,700 --> 00:51:00,710
Then once you get down to less than 2.1 meters, we'll talk to you about the future.

473
00:51:03,970 --> 00:51:10,420
So I misspoke a little bit earlier. I said some temptation that's big for this is important for the very big one.

474
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:15,550
So that's going to be above this. But I forgot to mention that what's good, even for some of the smaller particles,

475
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:24,070
you get very low air flow rates in some of these parts of the airways and that can set up for that gravitational wave deposition.

476
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:36,360
It's. Opportunity for that to happen. Clearance mechanisms sometimes we need to consider as well.

477
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:46,340
On her application. Oh, clinically or toxicological or whatever it might be in that nesa pharyngeal region.

478
00:51:48,060 --> 00:51:51,389
There are three blood soluble chemicals throughout the bloodstream.

479
00:51:51,390 --> 00:51:55,290
They're metabolized how they might be metabolized.

480
00:51:56,490 --> 00:52:02,940
You might also through impaction and the nose or mouth and ultimately swallowing them.

481
00:52:03,210 --> 00:52:10,170
Then it goes through the GI tract. That's actually where you see, as I mentioned, that missed work with not working fluids.

482
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:17,459
Some of those myths were kind of larger in the particle size region, so they'd be more likely to not make it all the way down to get out of the way.

483
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:28,460
But the big impact higher up. Get the higher end of the world in there, be more associated with GI tract cancers and things like that.

484
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:39,860
So it can make a big difference toxicological as well as physical mechanisms as well further down tracheal bronchial but again GI tract.

485
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:44,030
And then you have silica. Cilia. Little tiny hairs.

486
00:52:44,390 --> 00:52:49,170
And try to move. So you have different time scales as well.

487
00:52:49,170 --> 00:52:55,560
And then once you get to the gas exchange region. You have the blood that you talked about,

488
00:52:56,550 --> 00:53:03,420
but then you have things like macrophages to try to clear out those foreign substances over long periods of time.

489
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:08,820
And that, again, is where the fibrotic diseases can eliminate those macrophages,

490
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:14,430
can't get rid of that pristine silica, can't get rid of that asbestos fibers and keeps trying to fight.

491
00:53:14,430 --> 00:53:17,720
And that's where you get the scar. Broken tissue.

492
00:53:25,450 --> 00:53:29,880
So inhalable version. You touched on this briefly already.

493
00:53:29,890 --> 00:53:34,350
So likely to be inhaled. This is important for things that.

494
00:53:36,310 --> 00:53:39,970
Systemically did, making it to the GI tract.

495
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,330
It could be for how much in the middle? Working best.

496
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:54,749
However, a lot of times you might have different effects for different considerations at different points in their dosage.

497
00:53:54,750 --> 00:53:59,730
So inhalation alone, for some things that's considered good enough.

498
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:06,479
Hexavalent chromium standard. They say anything that makes it into your airways is bad.

499
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:09,690
So we're not going to even think about what's getting to you.

500
00:54:09,690 --> 00:54:11,490
The particular resistance, for example.

501
00:54:13,230 --> 00:54:21,170
But for research purposes, you might you definitely kind of want to know, is it inhalable versus thoracic versus restaurant?

502
00:54:23,630 --> 00:54:33,770
And then also when it comes to absorption. So here's an example of lead where GI absorption of words is much lower than your pulmonary absorption.

503
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:37,190
But so knowing if you just know it's inhalable,

504
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:45,830
you don't know beyond that where it might be deposited that could greatly impact the bioavailability or absorption percentage.

505
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:50,380
He gets. Move to other parts of the.

506
00:54:54,870 --> 00:54:58,499
I mentioned sampling. You will get more details later.

507
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:05,040
But again, the technologies of user sampling try to mimic the ones.

508
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:08,550
To try to get some different directions collected.

509
00:55:09,850 --> 00:55:15,550
Occupationally, we tend to refer to an individual thoracic, a respirator and those are the cut offs typically used.

510
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:20,180
Even that has nuances to it. So we're saying less than 100.

511
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:24,160
Less than four. But it's about that for there's distribution.

512
00:55:24,730 --> 00:55:28,060
But those are the the conventions that we typically use.

513
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:35,560
Environmentally similar concepts, but different definitions usually so pure.

514
00:55:35,590 --> 00:55:45,190
A lot of times we talk about PM10 people acquiring PM10, PM 2.5 particulate matter less than ten micrometers as PM10.

515
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:51,720
But typically greater than 2.5 particulate matter. Less than 2.5.

516
00:55:52,540 --> 00:55:57,870
It's considered fine particulate matter and then ultrafine is less.

517
00:55:58,990 --> 00:56:04,299
So sort of mimics our thoracic in which Australia not exactly environmentally it

518
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:09,700
can also there's a lot of differences with content in these particles as well.

519
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:13,990
A lot of times that PM 2.5 is much more combustion. We use the PM10 but more.

520
00:56:15,150 --> 00:56:24,750
Earth based. So again, we'll come back to this just kind of setting out some definitions and conventions.

521
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:32,340
All right. Back to you. Those so we talked about inflation rate.

522
00:56:32,790 --> 00:56:35,820
Right. But how do we get our concentration?

523
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:44,250
Well, we might be able to measure it with some of this technology, not mentioning or looking into the literature of what might be expected.

524
00:56:45,070 --> 00:56:48,690
Things like that might take into account time, variance, variations.

525
00:56:50,070 --> 00:56:53,950
And then you add that in with our inflation rate by beliefs, etc.

526
00:56:55,240 --> 00:57:00,490
So I'm just trying to bring it all back to the equation, trying to find the best information we can,

527
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:07,300
either resources we have available, documenting or going out and actually measuring.

528
00:57:13,420 --> 00:57:17,020
However, in those applications, we don't need to go that far.

529
00:57:17,250 --> 00:57:21,489
As far as, you know, tying off bioavailability, talking about inhalation rate,

530
00:57:21,490 --> 00:57:27,250
because all that's we built into the risk assessment process and standard setting process.

531
00:57:27,430 --> 00:57:33,640
Okay. So usually what we might go by is just that time weighted average or whatever that concentration is.

532
00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:39,370
Given certain protocols and conditions that you can just simply compare that level

533
00:57:39,370 --> 00:57:43,620
of measure with that standard of good and not have to worry about altogether.

534
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:51,030
So again, when you're talking about compliance, a lot of times we do this. If you're doing a detailed risk assessment, that's when you might go into.

535
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:58,010
Some of those other factors. And then you went and you do it again.

536
00:57:58,070 --> 00:58:05,110
You go deep, dove into one of those countries, bioavailability and police, and they might all have their own distributions, their own onesies.

537
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:09,149
But again, if you are looking at standard logic to do that.

538
00:58:09,150 --> 00:58:14,840
But risk assessment, that's why risk assessment which I out these next week.

539
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:20,680
But you can get contentious right. There's different assumptions that go into every every component of it.

540
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:25,670
You can make those assumptions, but you have to be able to kind of stand by them and say.

541
00:58:26,370 --> 00:58:40,530
That assumption was made. When our respiratory tract is our target organ, you might want to consider clearance mechanisms as well.

542
00:58:41,730 --> 00:58:48,060
Maybe not so much for dust and vapors, but for some of those particular chronic lung.

543
00:58:49,090 --> 00:58:51,520
Toxicants that might be necessary.

544
00:58:52,120 --> 00:59:02,679
So now we're getting maybe into more epidemiology or litigation type of applications where you're wondering what that lifetime exposure might be,

545
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:11,500
that cumulative exposure over a working career, working in a mine or whatever it might be if it's poorly cleared from the lungs.

546
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:17,010
The cumulative duration might be very important to equate with.

547
00:59:17,910 --> 00:59:24,120
Politics. However, timing should also be considered.

548
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:32,190
So for something like silica or asbestos, you know that lifetime exposure total might be equal for case in case be here.

549
00:59:33,150 --> 00:59:37,200
If you just look at what were they exposed to over the course of their career, their total is the same.

550
00:59:37,830 --> 00:59:39,570
However, if you think about resonance time,

551
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:47,370
the ability of that disease to form a progress case is going to be much worse off the case because they've had that much.

552
00:59:49,270 --> 00:59:52,630
Retention residence time business.

553
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:58,480
So to be aware of again that might be more linked to epidemiology.

554
00:59:59,380 --> 01:00:04,810
Person of interest. So I think that might be it for information.

555
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:11,620
There's a lot of information. We'll come back to some of this stuff throughout and apply it to various places where we.

556
01:00:12,890 --> 01:00:16,310
So the question is now, if not now, something.

557
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:21,410
We did go into turmoil a little bit before we.

558
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:28,979
They're pretty good so far. There's.

559
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:32,880
These are little rascals again. They're not they're not so little anymore.

560
01:00:34,540 --> 01:00:39,570
Couple of teenagers. But so we got this guy so premature.

561
01:00:40,180 --> 01:00:44,100
There's a reason they're married and again, kids.

562
01:00:44,460 --> 01:00:48,620
But, you know, I got one guy in there where the shirt was going to explode.

563
01:00:48,660 --> 01:00:52,080
Right. So that they're in water. So what's.

564
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:59,969
What's in this water here? Uh, you know, this is in order to make sure we get a flexible plastic, I should know better.

565
01:00:59,970 --> 01:01:03,690
I think contracted carpeting is nasty.

566
01:01:04,450 --> 01:01:11,140
I know some of my home, but not a lot on carpeted areas, which is just a sink for all kinds of stuff.

567
01:01:12,140 --> 01:01:16,170
And you have skin contact there, crayons.

568
01:01:16,170 --> 01:01:23,040
Other products are in contact with pets that go outdoors and come back in contract, all kinds of stuff.

569
01:01:23,550 --> 01:01:28,080
Direct line. I do not treat my line. Dr. Port Mostly Clover.

570
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:37,409
Usually it's fine. I keep it moved. So again, just try and get us thinking about dermal exposures.

571
01:01:37,410 --> 01:01:40,620
A lot of different applications, a lot of settings, which that can be a problem.

572
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:46,890
This is an environmental thing with kids, occupational, extremely important as well and so on.

573
01:01:47,940 --> 01:01:53,190
So back to again, focusing on this yellow component, the pathways to human.

574
01:01:54,510 --> 01:01:59,670
Here's another example I showed the present for inhalation, the chemical waste disposal.

575
01:02:01,090 --> 01:02:04,600
Here. This example is commission from a stack.

576
01:02:05,890 --> 01:02:10,720
So pooled admission from the stack, you might not think about term. All right, that's an obvious inflation.

577
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:15,850
But if you've mapped out this pathway, your concentrations in here, they might settle out into soil.

578
01:02:17,290 --> 01:02:21,780
So if you come into contact with people, it might make its way into the water again.

579
01:02:21,790 --> 01:02:25,660
That might come in terms of a skin contact and they forgot an arrow.

580
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:29,140
Have the air concentration celebrated on the right?

581
01:02:30,340 --> 01:02:34,600
A lot of factors. So dermal contact can be important here.

582
01:02:36,490 --> 01:02:42,900
In this example pathway as well. Uh.

583
01:02:43,180 --> 01:02:49,300
You know, I've always looked at the news. There's always chemical exposure stories in the news.

584
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:53,140
So here's one from last year.

585
01:02:53,140 --> 01:02:56,340
Your makeup may contain potentially toxic people, a study finds.

586
01:02:57,370 --> 01:03:02,640
Are we concerned? I'm not sure what.

587
01:03:03,210 --> 01:03:07,590
CNN I cut off the thing before they could enlighten us on whether we should concern or not.

588
01:03:07,590 --> 01:03:11,550
But so are we. What were we thinking? Inhalation.

589
01:03:12,990 --> 01:03:16,030
Thermal. Dermal. Dermal.

590
01:03:17,140 --> 01:03:22,410
Do we know what we might want to consider? If this is a concern for.

591
01:03:25,190 --> 01:03:35,910
Did you sit down? Yeah, he's there. I mean, if it's makeup or cosmetics, if you're playing it straight to the skin, what else might.

592
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:41,230
How long it's been on? How often it's used? Yes.

593
01:03:41,350 --> 01:03:46,370
Duration. Frequency. What about the chemical itself?

594
01:03:47,810 --> 01:03:52,080
I think all chemicals react to the same. Yeah.

595
01:03:52,110 --> 01:03:59,870
So that's a big one. So. As well as the mode in which it's used for the.

596
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:06,830
The vehicle. Is it mixed with solvents or is it just cloth?

597
01:04:06,980 --> 01:04:10,580
Is the concentration within that vehicle? So a lot of questions.

598
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:16,490
So kind of like with inhalation. This is another one where you can get really into the weeds.

599
01:04:16,670 --> 01:04:24,340
So I'm going to try to give us a fairly high level description and acknowledge some of the complexities, but maybe not get too far down.

600
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:30,440
Okay. So dermal exposure is contact a chemical filter down to the body.

601
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:36,410
Dermal exposure could be a concern for a couple of reasons. One is direct effects on the skin.

602
01:04:36,740 --> 01:04:45,410
So if you had a skin irritant in a cosmetic vessels, a skin irritant, it would show up as a skin issue.

603
01:04:46,730 --> 01:04:49,850
Burns are also concerned with certain types of acid.

604
01:04:49,850 --> 01:04:59,460
Something. Sort of. And then we have our systemic concerns.

605
01:04:59,670 --> 01:05:04,440
I think it's through the skin and then in the circulation. So kind of like what we're talking about with.

606
01:05:06,030 --> 01:05:11,460
So direct effects on skin we don't we're not as concerned with with the penetration.

607
01:05:13,050 --> 01:05:15,990
Absorption, but for those systemic we are.

608
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:25,080
So this is a complex process where, again, some chemicals may be more or less likely to penetrate the skin than others.

609
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:28,990
We'll talk about some of those. Considerations.

610
01:05:33,260 --> 01:05:40,100
And the thermal. So with inhalation, you know, it is complex,

611
01:05:40,100 --> 01:05:46,820
but there's been so much time and effort devoted to being able to measure it and setting standards and guidelines with that in mind.

612
01:05:47,140 --> 01:05:48,100
But it's pretty straightforward.

613
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:56,840
Once you get to dirt, it's sort of it's still kind of the Wild West and how it's estimated, how we look at exposure, estimation and risk.

614
01:05:58,790 --> 01:06:04,510
But there's some very. This is an older slide.

615
01:06:04,540 --> 01:06:13,340
Occupationally again looking at workplace illnesses in private industry poisoning with respiratory conditions.

616
01:06:13,990 --> 01:06:20,229
Go back to what we were just talking about, generation and then this this pie piece right here, 21,000.

617
01:06:20,230 --> 01:06:24,010
These are skin disorders. So skin disorders are extremely common and occupational.

618
01:06:24,010 --> 01:06:27,730
So you use a lot of caustic or.

619
01:06:30,010 --> 01:06:35,620
The harsh chemicals industry. So it makes sense. Then they want a bunch of other.

620
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:41,650
I should probably drill down and see what they. For another day.

621
01:06:43,030 --> 01:06:49,780
Okay. So common types of dermatitis and various agents, the types of agents that might cause them.

622
01:06:50,290 --> 01:06:53,680
I'm not going to read this to you again, just an example of what's out there.

623
01:06:54,040 --> 01:07:01,150
When we talk about health effects, various different types of skin lesions, different types of.

624
01:07:02,220 --> 01:07:06,420
Chemicals. So you have installed walls, alkaline solvents, soaps.

625
01:07:07,580 --> 01:07:11,330
All kinds of different things, cosmic goals and kind of what they look like.

626
01:07:12,110 --> 01:07:18,469
But we're not going to spend a ton of time on the actual skin effects because frankly,

627
01:07:18,470 --> 01:07:22,250
that's the easier part of estimating dermal exposure is kind of just what gets to the skin.

628
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:28,070
It is tricky, though, but. It's going to be tough love.

629
01:07:29,870 --> 01:07:33,520
Look, we'll get through this. Another thing to consider.

630
01:07:33,730 --> 01:07:39,160
So that's a lot of skin disorders. We also have an allergic reaction that can take place.

631
01:07:39,250 --> 01:07:41,799
So kind of like with the respiratory subsidization,

632
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:47,680
like occupational asthma and also skin sensitization and that's called allergic contact dermatitis.

633
01:07:47,950 --> 01:07:52,180
Or if you have a high exposure and you're susceptible,

634
01:07:52,660 --> 01:08:02,650
it can cause an immune reaction that then you can maybe in the future just be exposed to very tiny amounts and then break out of this type of skin.

635
01:08:03,460 --> 01:08:10,230
We're talking about airways. It was three. It's just different phases of contact dermatitis.

636
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:16,940
Okay. And I don't want to minimize the significance of this serious.

637
01:08:17,070 --> 01:08:23,399
And like these shorts, they are very comfortable. So talk in a few minutes.

638
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:31,170
A lot of skin structure. So here are composed of multiple layers of cells interspersed with sweat glands, sebaceous glands and hair follicles.

639
01:08:32,700 --> 01:08:36,220
It's crazy to think it is the largest organized body.

640
01:08:36,370 --> 01:08:38,530
So much of, I think, a skin organ.

641
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:48,880
But it does have functions and is extremely important as it's our main protective barrier for many people is about 10% of our body mass.

642
01:08:50,410 --> 01:08:54,460
So barrier has sensory functions, also temperature control.

643
01:08:57,630 --> 01:09:05,160
Two layers are epidermis in the dermis, and within the epidermis, the very outer layer that we see is the strand of cornea.

644
01:09:06,180 --> 01:09:09,840
And below that is that what we call that viable epidermis?

645
01:09:11,100 --> 01:09:14,730
So those are two of the more important components.

646
01:09:15,100 --> 01:09:18,760
What do you think about. Here's an old picture.

647
01:09:20,580 --> 01:09:25,670
I said I could find a better one, but. So here's the surface of our skin.

648
01:09:25,670 --> 01:09:28,670
Here's a hair and a hair follicle.

649
01:09:29,030 --> 01:09:33,020
This layer right here is our stretch of cornea. So that's the very outside layer.

650
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:39,800
So, again, very important with regards to protection from chemical, chemical agents.

651
01:09:40,310 --> 01:09:45,900
And then right here is our viable epidermis, the strand.

652
01:09:46,880 --> 01:10:03,680
And below that is the dermis. So him again against that very outer, outer layer composed of parallel arrays of protein ratios,

653
01:10:03,890 --> 01:10:10,430
cells separated by a little bit rich intracellular regions, and they call this a brick and mortar arrangement.

654
01:10:10,430 --> 01:10:14,620
So. It's great. See how they're staggered.

655
01:10:15,770 --> 01:10:19,140
They break in between. That's how.

656
01:10:19,150 --> 01:10:20,110
If you see pictures of the.

657
01:10:21,630 --> 01:10:30,760
They look like they're composed of dead, partially set, desiccated fertilized epidermal cells and replenished every two or three weeks.

658
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:35,010
So it's always kind of regenerating, working its way out.

659
01:10:38,230 --> 01:10:45,550
It brings up a very important point. So this is, again, the rate limiting the future prime minister.

660
01:10:45,850 --> 01:10:55,480
So a lot of times when we think about terminal uptake, we need to think carefully about the strategy and how it interacts with the temporal interest.

661
01:10:57,130 --> 01:11:02,800
Again, we have some rules of thumb, the rule of thumb of chemicals or some crazy thing that's going to break it.

662
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:13,540
But generally, fatty non-polar chemicals tend to accumulate in skin, whereas how you poor or ionized chemicals don't permeate readily readily.

663
01:11:13,570 --> 01:11:15,400
So the starting point, it was effective for that.

664
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:23,229
But then you have these chemicals that are kind of non-polar and might be might have both hydrophobic and hydrophilic characteristics

665
01:11:23,230 --> 01:11:29,470
that are able to kind of navigate their way through the skin that we might be more concerned about the systemic perspective.

666
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:42,840
Here's the brick and mortar structure. Protein rich cells with lipids in between.

667
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:50,010
So chemical certain chemical properties that you can manage or imagine would be more.

668
01:11:52,210 --> 01:11:55,690
Compatible with transferring through the protein.

669
01:11:56,440 --> 01:12:10,760
Navigating through lipid or. The next layer of viral epidermis 50 to 100 kilometers to transport.

670
01:12:10,780 --> 01:12:15,070
Once we get through that stranded cornea, the chemicals are more likely to permeate.

671
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:20,500
So again, that strong cornea must work. Our first defense is in our dust.

672
01:12:20,860 --> 01:12:28,780
Once it gets past that, it's likely not to have much defense unless it's the chemical properties.

673
01:12:30,470 --> 01:12:37,209
A line such that it gets kind of stuck. Down in that Bible verse and there's a little blood flow.

674
01:12:37,210 --> 01:12:42,490
But again, it's going to move down to the dermis where you do have a lot of blood flow, and that's where you start getting into a circulation.

675
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:51,110
Because we have always blood vessels. Sweat glands, hair follicles, etc.

676
01:12:52,310 --> 01:12:59,210
And that's where we want to prevent. Unless you're talking about like the nicotine patches.

677
01:12:59,980 --> 01:13:07,440
That's what they're trying to get through there. They're talking about medication delivery, but for toxic chemicals, typically.

678
01:13:15,770 --> 01:13:19,380
Slide. 59.

679
01:13:26,340 --> 01:13:29,460
It's Thursday. You guys ready to pack it up?

680
01:13:30,660 --> 01:13:34,740
It's a lot of material. Okay, we'll stop there.

681
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:39,930
You know, I'm trying to get through the risk assessment by next Thursday, but if not, we can figure it out.

682
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:46,320
So I appreciate your attention. Again, let me know if you have questions.

683
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:47,980
And again.
