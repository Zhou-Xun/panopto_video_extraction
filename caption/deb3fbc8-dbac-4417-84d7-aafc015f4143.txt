00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:14,280
During this module, we're going to build on our discussion of the Organization of Public Health,

2
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:20,160
health care and regulatory systems by hearing from a panel of national experts.

3
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:25,200
This panel is going to discuss how management of the U.S. health care system,

4
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:31,110
personalized medicine and climate change are all going to shape public health in the future.

5
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:39,270
You're going to hear firsthand about the intersection of public health, philosophy and values with public policy and medical care.

6
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:41,700
And as you listen to the panel discussion,

7
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:48,960
I want you to think about how the core functions of public health are really being addressed in different emergent areas.

8
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:59,040
Think about some of these questions. How are the ten essential services impacted by advances in technology related to personalized medicine?

9
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:05,650
How is the role of government evolving as part of the ongoing transformation of the U.S. health care system?

10
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:16,590
How is climate change contributing to the need for public health professionals to address new challenges related to the health of populations?

11
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:24,420
Finally, I want you to think very carefully about how you would approach some of these contemporary public health

12
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:31,740
challenges and what role you would play as a public health professional to address some of these needs.
