1
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:16,070
Yeah. Yeah.

2
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:24,370
Hi, everyone. Hi.

3
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:30,790
I have two, five, five, five, six, three.

4
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,410
Love number one. My name is Daniella.

5
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:41,160
I'm going to be in charge of these section on as well as the one on one space.

6
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:45,870
There is another G a sidebar introduced for later.

7
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:54,770
So what we're going to do today, it's just the first five, 15 minutes is just like introduce what we're going to do in the labs.

8
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:59,220
What the purpose of the labs. Where you can find everything about the labs in campus.

9
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,910
And after that, we are just going to start with the actual lab for today. Okay.

10
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:12,940
Okay. So here's a brief outline for us.

11
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:20,890
We're going to talk about logistics on that section, something that you may not always see rock here on Chi Square,

12
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:24,670
which are all problems that are in homework, number one.

13
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:30,250
So before we start before we start very important work things.

14
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:33,850
Find all of these so you can just like follow me as I'm talking.

15
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:41,080
Everything it's already uploaded in countless labs are going to be downloaded, probably like, I don't know, it's not to start today.

16
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:47,889
On Monday they're going to be uploaded by Friday, the previous week where you can find everything.

17
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:54,799
So image ops. So quickly.

18
00:01:54,800 --> 00:02:03,680
If we go to the combat side here, if you go to home by 523 right here, you love files.

19
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:10,880
Okay. So like every week we are going to upload log files, the log files half.

20
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:15,200
First of all, the presentation, which is exactly the same in 6 seconds,

21
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:25,280
the same as the one that I will be using on both SAS card on our code, which is you can use whatever you feel more comfortable with.

22
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:33,130
Okay. So. Before we again who we are.

23
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,399
So I'm ready. Have myself. My name is.

24
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,480
I'm here now. I'm here. There are two guests for this class.

25
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:46,240
All I know is at last, I am a second year Masters student from the Rice Department.

26
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:51,520
I majored in industrial engineering and I also have a masters in Ninjutsu Engineering.

27
00:02:52,570 --> 00:03:01,000
I'm from Bogota, Colombia. So forgive me, please, if sometimes I make mistakes or if you don't, I'm of like.

28
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:04,130
If I cannot express my self well enough.

29
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:09,730
Just like us. Me. I'll figure something out. And that's it.

30
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:18,640
I don't have to tell you. The other GSI will not be with us, but she has two other lab sections.

31
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:22,540
That doesn't mean that you cannot contact her if you want to contact her.

32
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:32,510
That's also fine. But mostly if you need to. Like anything from this class, I should be your first contact regarding labs and office hours.

33
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:38,670
So mine are on Mondays. On Wednesdays. I have office hours immediately after lunch.

34
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:42,909
So for example, today I have office hours, 6 to 7 on Wednesdays as well.

35
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:49,629
We have office hours, 6 to 7. We decided that office hours late at night are best for the majority of the students that we have.

36
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:55,270
So like we you don't have classes, hopefully you don't have classes or any other things that you have to attend,

37
00:03:55,870 --> 00:04:05,380
but if you actually really do want to the office hours, both of my office hours are held on zoom and they are not going to be recorded.

38
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:11,049
That's important. Office hours other than mine are.

39
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:17,920
Dr. Morais has office hours and there are two office hours tomorrow, 6 to 7.

40
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:21,820
And then on Thursday, 5 to 6. Okay.

41
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:27,130
Do you guys have any questions regarding the labs itself?

42
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:33,360
So how are they going to work? I don't know for me.

43
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,840
I think you already took 522. Right on 521.

44
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:47,850
So that's very, very similar to 522 lots. So we are going to review some code basically that is going to be very helpful for your homeworks.

45
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:53,670
That's like primarily, you know, the main objective of this class review code.

46
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,520
Unlike a couple of things that are going to help you to like complete your homework.

47
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:04,740
Labs are clearly in-person. However, we are going to record elapse.

48
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:08,910
I am actually recording myself right now, so hopefully everything is going to go well.

49
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:13,200
So in case you kind of attend, all labs are going to be recorded.

50
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:17,280
That means today I'm going to record a lot Wednesday. I'm also what I recorded a lot.

51
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:28,229
So you you're going to have tons of recording time come after each week please if you are going to if you choose to attend in person.

52
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:35,100
I don't have Zoom right now. So like the only option available is either to attend in person or to watch a lot of recording after.

53
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:42,719
But if you are going to attend, as you can see, like the lab is already very full, so please go to your last section.

54
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:50,790
That means please try to not go to tomorrow section or to Wednesday sections because like as you can see, it's very hard to accommodate everyone.

55
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:54,550
We lecture on our computer. What else?

56
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:59,800
So as I told you before, we are going to review source code on our code,

57
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:05,290
everything that is already every everything that you need for the lab, it's already uploaded.

58
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:13,060
Meaning that, for example, in 522 I was like writing code and then you are like writing that code with me.

59
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:19,620
That's not going to happen here. We already upload the code. It's already commented that it's in either source or are.

60
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:25,329
So you can just like download that and run it of the same time as I'm going to do it so

61
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:29,319
you can see the output and just make sure that different and you understand everything.

62
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:34,300
Okay, so that's a little bit different. So we don't doing touch of okay.

63
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:40,420
And then again, the main objective of the lab is just to like go to some of the questions of the homework

64
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:44,170
and then hopefully you can start doing your homework as soon as we finish here.

65
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:51,490
Just a reminder, there are six homework this semester on the due date time and ready on canvas.

66
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:57,580
Today we're going to start reviewing Homework one, which is due Sunday, September 18.

67
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:06,190
Any questions regarding laps? Oh, then we're ready to start.

68
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:13,990
So I'm going to be teaching both like stars on our code.

69
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,710
You can working whatever you want. There's no restrictions.

70
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:23,000
You can do your homework in sauce. Are some parts in sauce, some us.

71
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:27,760
Some parts in our however you prefer. Others it's just update.

72
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:34,330
So regarding the funds that are isolated uploaded on campus, if you are using SaaS,

73
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:39,280
please download download the dot source extension and work with us.

74
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:47,500
If you are working with are the DOT are extensions, that's the one that you should be using right off.

75
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:54,950
And then we also have to other files are a files on how some extensions that

76
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:02,770
are D this probably it's nice that you know what is on our smart down which I

77
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:07,899
know like some of you know but if you don't just program but it's actually not

78
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:11,380
important if you just work with this that art it's going to be completely fine.

79
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:15,820
And then this third HCM is just something that outputs these.

80
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,290
These are not done. So like if you're if you don't want to work with our homes, don't.

81
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:24,120
Just don't. Thank you. Projection? Yeah.

82
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:29,230
No, it's everything. Fine, thank you. Okay.

83
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:37,960
And then how to work? My recommendation in general is you bring your own computer, and I work with that.

84
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:46,420
However, you can work with the computers that are here. If you're working with software, a couple of options so you can work with.

85
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:49,540
We recommend use fast on the mind.

86
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:58,420
There's like on a slide later about how that works or you use the beautiful sites that the university offers or just logging into these computer,

87
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:05,829
they already have source. And then if you are working with ah you have to download, ah, there's no way to do it.

88
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:09,790
We just download on or our studio in this case.

89
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:17,649
So if you're working with source and you choose to do source on demand, so the difference between source on our are is free.

90
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:26,860
So you literally downloaded right now source is not so the university's paid paid for that software in some of the computers.

91
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:32,830
So for example this one so you can use source here but if you are home and you don't have source, there are a couple of ways to do it.

92
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:38,260
You source on demand or access to all sides of the both sides of.

93
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:44,440
SDH So you saw something on just go to this link and then you the form sign out

94
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:49,990
and that's you sign up with your own which account and you just like use it later.

95
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:56,770
Okay. So now I'm done with everything that concerns logistical.

96
00:09:56,770 --> 00:10:01,510
Fill up any questions so far? Okay.

97
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,700
So let's assign we'd made analysis, so I don't know if you are ready to review the homework.

98
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:10,899
The homework needs two problems. The first problem it's mainly made.

99
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:21,640
I'm analysis enough on a of plot. Second problem is rock here on Mantle, Hazel on contingency tables on all of them.

100
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:28,809
So we're going to review Homer one problem, one, that does not mean that we are not doing a problem here.

101
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:32,440
That just means that we are going to work with a similar problem as the homework.

102
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:37,960
So then you can just like actually do that. So if you can load the.

103
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:45,350
Presentation, which I highly recommend do recommended to these meetings,

104
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:52,820
actually takes you to parts of the presentations where like we solve we either the soft softcore or the art code.

105
00:10:53,570 --> 00:11:01,970
So for example, if you download the presentation on both diseases slide and then click on the link invariance bar inverse variance method,

106
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:06,110
that would be the method analysis code using source.

107
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:11,380
And then this make will get go to my final, which is about using up.

108
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:20,270
Okay. So I highly recommend that you download the presentation so you can just like copy paste a code or just immediately go and see it.

109
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:30,470
Okay. So for them I found out this is so suppose we are we have this table from our paper which is homemade analysis of,

110
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:40,880
you know, the information that we have basically is here we have all of the papers, the different papers.

111
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:45,500
I'm here, we have something that will help us construct it two by two table.

112
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:55,280
So this is mortality in a randomized trial of intravenous magnesium in suspected acute myocardial infarction.

113
00:11:55,580 --> 00:12:04,370
So like for this paper, we know that for the magnesium group there was one dead and there were 40, 40 people in this group.

114
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:11,750
And then there were two deaths and 36, 36 people in the control group is up to here.

115
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:17,870
And then that holds for all of the papers. What we want to do is just randomized analysis here.

116
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:22,879
So how do we run a mirror analysis here?

117
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,040
Meaning we want the odds ratio for the entire thing.

118
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:35,420
We we want to test also if the odds ratio is the same between us studies or not and we want to do a final block, that means running on the house.

119
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:44,800
So the first thing is we need to. Create our data sites in either source or us.

120
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:50,870
So how do we create a data site? It's very similar between source and art.

121
00:12:51,290 --> 00:13:00,830
The thing is that the most important thing is, is to understand how this how can I go from this stable to to y to table.

122
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:05,030
So in this case, we have two, four, six, seven.

123
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:10,430
So this meaning that you can create seven different two by two tables, one for each of study,

124
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:18,560
and we have to type those data out like exactly the two white two tables for the seven stories in SAS on our to run them on.

125
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:24,860
So for example, if I choose these first three, the two I do table would be something like this.

126
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:32,300
So here I have one of the variables which is, which is the magnesium, which will be like either the treatment or the control group.

127
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:37,730
And here I have the variable that we are interested in, meaning like, are they there?

128
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:44,360
Did they died or not? So here, if you read about this table,

129
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:53,060
we have that these two numbers means the first one is number of deaths and the second one, it's number of people in that group.

130
00:13:53,480 --> 00:14:02,540
So for the first for the first paper, I have one person that is in the magnesium group that died.

131
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:07,670
So I want I have one here, one person in the magnesium group that died.

132
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:12,110
And then this 40 means that there are 40 people in the magnesium group.

133
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:17,220
So like this 40 goes here. And as you know that the two y2 tables need to add up.

134
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:21,170
So this means that this thing that I don't have in the table must be 39.

135
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:29,690
Correct. And then you do the same thing with the control group and that that's how you just get the two by two tables for the seven studies.

136
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:34,590
Any questions so far? Oh.

137
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:42,490
So once you do that, once you create like a seven by seven and by create, I mean like you can do it by hand.

138
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:49,059
Once you have that, it's time to put all of that data into source or so in source.

139
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:56,170
Remember that the command to create data sets within source is just data.

140
00:14:56,170 --> 00:15:00,130
And then this is the name you're going to call it uses you choose whatever, anything you want.

141
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:05,560
So in this case I'm using that for my connection of magnesium on that.

142
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:16,330
And then input on input is use the number like the name of the variables that I want in my data set and have a study magnesium which can be yes or no,

143
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:20,620
that with which can also be yes or no. And then the number of people that I have here.

144
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:25,930
So for example, these do I do table is just these form lines in source.

145
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:32,950
So this is the study number one. And then I have four possible numbers here, which are the four possible combinations here.

146
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:39,760
And then you have to do that for all of the seven studies. And that's how you create that table in plus questions.

147
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:46,700
Makes sense. Okay. So once you do that, which the code is already loaded.

148
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:57,560
Once you do that, we just want to test for the odds ratio for the overall relationship between that and magnesium.

149
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:02,890
So how do we do that in SAS? We use frac of data.

150
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:13,190
It's equal to whatever name you chose in this slide before and then really important that you order the data and then to create the table,

151
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:20,450
command table, the name of your variables. So these must be exactly the same as the ones that you use before.

152
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,070
So I study magnesium then, which were the names that I assigned previously?

153
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:29,330
And then this is a command to have the month.

154
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:37,010
Okay, so on. There is no grade is just because whenever I run from track I have a bunch of these bunch

155
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:41,270
of things in SAS and I actually just one a little table with the amount of pace that's.

156
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:45,980
And then when do you. Oh I'm very, very important. Please do not forget.

157
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:50,090
Wait count, which is actually the numbers of the two by two table.

158
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:54,890
Once you run this, the output should be something like this.

159
00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:06,470
So what we are looking at here is the amount that they stick on for the general association between all of their roles,

160
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:12,020
the ones that we are interested in, the general association, we have the degrees of freedom of that test.

161
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:18,350
The first statistic which remember is a square random variable and then the p value.

162
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:24,090
Correct. Okay. So questions so far.

163
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:33,010
Okay. Um, just a brief reminder.

164
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:40,270
Remember that here we are. We are testing if the null hypothesis is that the overall odds ratio is equal to one,

165
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:44,050
and the alternative is that the overall odds ratio is not equal to one.

166
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:44,530
Correct.

167
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:57,580
And then based on these, you can either compare the test statistic against like the critical value or the p value against the significance level.

168
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:01,540
And then you can reject or do not fail to reject the null hypothesis.

169
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:06,280
It's does everyone follows me so far. Does that make sense?

170
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:10,240
Okay, good. Okay.

171
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:21,220
So that's if you look at this table, this only gives you the best statistic but does not give you the actual odds ratio.

172
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:30,309
But if you scroll down a little bit, think all of the outputs in cells, there should be a table, something like this,

173
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:37,570
which is called common odds ratio on relative relative risk, which will give you the actual odds ratio.

174
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:42,999
As you already know, there are two odds ratio. Well, yeah, the absolute ratio that we can see,

175
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:53,740
that we can see one is in month of heysel and then the other one is the odds ratio about using the invariance method in inverse variance method.

176
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:57,970
But we have both of them here. We have the confidence intervals.

177
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:04,590
So this is the odds ratio for each of them at that time. This is the confidence interval for each of these methods of duration.

178
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:10,900
And do we have questions so far?

179
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:16,740
Okay. I forgot to ask something. Just so I have an idea.

180
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:31,780
How many of you are working with SAS? Only so the majority of people on 1.600000 really quickly if you're working.

181
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:36,610
We are. Remember, the first thing you should do is install packages.

182
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:40,540
You don't need to do that in files, but you do need to do it in half.

183
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,580
The package for doing meta analysis in our it's called make up.

184
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:48,690
So first install packages and then library up.

185
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:53,140
And then once you do, you do that you can actually start working.

186
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:59,410
We later will be using metaphor for doing life forecasting meta analysis.

187
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:08,829
So can you also please install load that's library and then don't way to do exactly the same exactly

188
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:15,380
that same procedure that we did installs but we are this the way to table conversion you have to do.

189
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:24,430
But those implications are for art. So here you create your two virtual tables and they create you having vectors for all of that information.

190
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:34,690
So for example, remember that if we have to wait two tables, this is a, b, c on the right and this is and one and two and one and two.

191
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:44,290
So I can just create I can play a better of a which contains all of the A's in my seven to do table.

192
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:50,290
So this is the vector right here. So for the first story, that's as far as this study, that number is one.

193
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:57,340
For the second story, the number is nine. And then do we target these numbers, one 9 to 110, so on and so forth.

194
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:00,790
So what we are doing here is creating all of those vectors.

195
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:06,550
Once you create all of those vectors, then this is not mandatory.

196
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:13,239
This is just me trying to, you know, of names or labels to this table.

197
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:17,650
So this is the name of the first study. This is the name of the second study and so on and so forth.

198
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:24,940
But once you create all of those vectors, then you can use a function within that package that we already uploaded.

199
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,790
But that function is called make up,

200
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:35,829
so that the function to do meta analysis in our app is going to ask you for all of those are vectors that we created.

201
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:45,250
So is then ask you for all of those A's, all of those and all of those C, so on and so forth, and then just control in there and run that function.

202
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:54,100
In this case, with this code, I save all of the output from that function in something called inverse analysis.

203
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:59,260
So then here I'm running, that is personality. So you can find it in the global environment.

204
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:07,280
And then the output looks very similar to whatever we use in SAS, the output for our like.

205
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:15,790
So first is going to give you for each study, it's going to give you the all the odds ratio and the confidence interval.

206
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:26,020
And then if you want the math, okay, so it should be like a scroll down, a little data should be below this and then for the month.

207
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:32,620
Okay, so just make sure you are looking at the road speaks effect model and then if you compare these numbers,

208
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:39,950
these are the same as the output in SAS and this particular output is using the environment.

209
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:47,020
That's very important. Whenever you are using that function we are using here the environs make it in half

210
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:54,550
of it and then you can have here you you have the you show the confidence in there,

211
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:58,240
all the people. So exactly the same.

212
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:08,680
Okay. And then to run the overall odds ratio without the combined environment method.

213
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:11,850
So just like the normal one, you have to go an extra step.

214
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:18,910
So now we're going to use this function. It's also within that make a library.

215
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:25,749
It's going to ask you for all of these things that we already created and that function is going to give you the odds ratio,

216
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:33,220
but without the environment methods, just like the normal object, that's maybe the only difference between this.

217
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:39,339
So once we you run this function, which is like save in this output, you have the month.

218
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:39,700
Okay?

219
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:50,710
So right here, so the estimate of the confidence interval and the confidence interval and then the actual value of the test statistic and the P one.

220
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:55,480
Okay, that's it. Any questions so far?

221
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:06,450
Oh. Okay. Hmm. Okay.

222
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:14,790
All right. So now back to the be part of homework number one problem.

223
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:21,930
One is just the you know, the running of this stats on whether the odds ratio is equal to one or not.

224
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,200
On if there is a difference between the studies, so on and so forth.

225
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:30,270
And also another big part of the problem is to create a fun onslaught.

226
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:37,800
So how do we create a fun flood? Very important to create a planet.

227
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:44,740
But we are going to use. The natural logarithm of the odds ratio.

228
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:53,790
Okay, that's very important. That's one of the most common mistakes when people are creating the funnel plot.

229
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:58,990
So we are going to use the model logarithm of the odds ratio for each study.

230
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:05,780
And then since we are using them as a logarithm, we should also use the variance of the natural logarithm.

231
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:12,810
Okay. So we are not going to work with odds ratio. So we are going to work with the natural logarithm of the odds ratio.

232
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:16,410
That's the most important thing for iPhone, if not odds ratio.

233
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:21,030
Natural logarithm of odds ratio. So what's a funnel?

234
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:27,360
Blood funnel looks like this. Each point correspond to one of the seven studies that I have.

235
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:31,970
And then the two axes are in the x axis.

236
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:38,010
I have the low, not the odds ratio of the natural logarithm of the odds ratio.

237
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:45,480
And then the y axis. I have the standard error of the of that map of that natural logarithm of the odds ratio.

238
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:52,650
And for each a I look the odds ratio, the natural order on the error of that observation.

239
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:59,700
And these are the second ones. And then the other very important part of the funnel blood is to create these two lines.

240
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:03,360
Baselines are basically a confidence interval.

241
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:08,100
Okay. In this class, we are mainly on I use 95% confidence interval.

242
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:11,519
That 95 is going to be very important later on.

243
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,700
What we can tell about this one. One is what is that?

244
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:24,960
For example, this a study does not fall within the 95% confidence interval of all of the other studies or actually of this study with the smallest.

245
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:32,310
Odds ratio. And that's it. What can we tell them this time?

246
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:34,180
What about this? A study has something.

247
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:45,110
Debatable because all of this other stakes fall within the 95% confidence interval, and that particular does not.

248
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:53,080
Why? It does not? It can be for a lot of things. Maybe because of their sample size, maybe because there's some bias.

249
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:56,690
There's either selection bias or maybe, I don't know, defense of this study.

250
00:26:56,930 --> 00:27:06,080
The important thing is that we can create a 95% confidence interval among all of the studies that we are analyzing, and that is one of them.

251
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:10,459
In this case, there could be more that does not fall within that 95%.

252
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:13,580
And that's something to be careful about. Okay.

253
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:19,100
So how do we make a fun of what?

254
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:27,430
Mm hmm. Oh.

255
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:32,720
So the problem goes something like this.

256
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:40,880
The first thing you're going to do is for you to study. Just obtain operational error of the observation.

257
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:45,570
You should already have that because we already did that in the you know in those stable suddenly.

258
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:54,280
Great. Yes, but don't worry, I'm going to do it like using our answers.

259
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:58,060
And then once you plug this, we need to plug these two lines.

260
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:07,700
To plug these lines. First thing we are going to do is to identify the paper with the smallest standout area.

261
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:12,970
On the base of that paper, we are going to create the 95% confidence interval.

262
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:19,280
So in this case. As you can see.

263
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:26,720
Remember that the y axis is based on that. As you can see, this one is the one with the smallest on that error.

264
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:30,050
I know that seems we are, because it's the one that is like farther away.

265
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:33,260
But just like, look at this, um, look at these axis.

266
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:36,500
So here I have 1.5. Here I have zero.

267
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:42,290
So the one with the smallest is somewhat error is this one. So how do, how do we construct those lines?

268
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:46,040
Choose this one and then.

269
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:55,410
Okay. So this is our reference line.

270
00:28:56,070 --> 00:29:02,640
Let's say that the standard error of that paper is like 1.35, something like that.

271
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:05,310
So we are going to go point 35 to Bob.

272
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:13,780
And then from that point 35 above, we're going to draw two lines, you know, two lines out of like 95% confidence interval.

273
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:19,410
That's what we are doing. Fine. I'm Brant.

274
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:22,830
Why do I keep telling you? 95% confidence interval.

275
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:35,639
Because when I use this 1.96, which, if you recall, it's the 95% percentile of a standard normal distribution so plentiful up to made very easy.

276
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:44,480
Just slide all of the papers most natural logarithm of the observation on a standard error of that matter already.

277
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:48,809
Then after that be the one with the smallest on that error.

278
00:29:48,810 --> 00:29:53,430
And then just I mean I it's not work for you on size is going to do it for you.

279
00:29:53,430 --> 00:30:00,870
But basically these two lines are a 95% confidence interval around the essential error of that paper.

280
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:08,700
Okay, so we are created creating the 95% confidence interval around the paper with this small this is standard error and that's it.

281
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:15,390
So to do that, how do we do it? SS This is a little, yeah.

282
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:28,469
So in fact, first we need the data that we already create created in the front very, very, very first step of this a step length study.

283
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:39,840
And then I think here it's because I'm going to display a plot, but it's all it's also going to show me like the levels of each study.

284
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:45,760
So I need to tell SAS how many characters are in each label.

285
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:49,140
And it's just I mean, I'm not going to count.

286
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:55,500
I don't know. For example, here I have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, ten characters.

287
00:30:55,740 --> 00:31:04,740
I'm just going to say, hey, the maximum is 15 or 20. These number is just like the maximum length of the name of a paper.

288
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:09,690
And why is that important is not important for the fun of what is just to make it look a little bit better.

289
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:18,450
That's it. So like when we do the fun of what is a dot and then the name of the dot that's on the actual forehead.

290
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:26,700
So from data, we need the A study we need a and from that I'm sorry,

291
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:33,990
we are going to create something called study A in one C and then how do we create those things?

292
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,770
Yeah, we are going to include those values here.

293
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:47,030
And then based on those values, we are going to create B and C and then the standard error, which is just the natural logarithm of the odds ratio,

294
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:56,339
is that in to y to table we calculate that's a time Z over B and C and then here the standard error,

295
00:31:56,340 --> 00:32:01,580
which is the square root of one over A plus one over B plus one of receipt.

296
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:12,930
So on. And so far, so in these lives, what I'm telling SAS is, Hey, I'm going to give you some data and structure data that has these R properties.

297
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:21,179
The first thing is the name of this study. Then we have some values that I'm going to call A in one C, I mean, do and based on those values,

298
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:30,480
you are going to create these new variables which are the standard error and the odds ratio based on that.

299
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:36,090
And then here after the data lines, I'm actually going to import on the change, the values for those data.

300
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:44,280
So first thing, the name of me of my study, please make sure I do not understand is spaces.

301
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:51,480
So I know the name of the studies Martin is space and space all but says do not understand spaces.

302
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:56,880
So that's why I have an underscore here. So this is a number this is a name of this study.

303
00:32:57,150 --> 00:33:04,470
And then I have one which corresponds in this case to a which it's the value of that to to table.

304
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:12,020
And then here I have in one which corresponds to the in one of the two way to table of the paper and so on and so forth.

305
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:16,640
Does that make sense? Yes. Okay.

306
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:23,440
And then if you run this up here, nothing happens.

307
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:26,700
That's just creating the data set. And then.

308
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:37,580
Okay. So then nothing happens. I'm just creating the dataset with this chunk of code.

309
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:42,340
I'm just framing for each of these to study the odds ratio.

310
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:47,380
I'll tell you the natural logarithm of the odds ratio on the standard error.

311
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:50,890
Okay, that's it. But I'm not creating this one flood yet.

312
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:55,740
So to create the file plot. Rock and strip clubs.

313
00:33:56,850 --> 00:34:01,899
All right. So you just as you plug data,

314
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:12,670
it's going to be the table that displays for each study the standard error and then the natural logarithm of the odds ratio.

315
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,450
So that is data here and then here.

316
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:22,960
I'm just like, you know, making up labels on the title and making sure everything just looks fine.

317
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:34,150
It's just cut out plot where the x axis is the natural logarithm of the odds ratio and the y axis is the standard error.

318
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:43,390
So that's what I have here. And then here with these two lines, I'm creating the 95% confidence interval here.

319
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:56,250
Okay. So this first part of the code create this kind of block, and then this second part of the code create the 95% confidence interval lines.

320
00:34:56,930 --> 00:35:01,740
X So line pass creates a line in a plot.

321
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:09,129
So I'm going to create a line enough blood. I'm going to get an X value on one and a Y value.

322
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:12,730
I'm a slope. And that's basically everything you need to create a line.

323
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:21,160
So these X value, these -1.0556 A's, I'm going to go to my table.

324
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:28,690
I'm going to go to my table with all of your stories.

325
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:32,740
With all of the odds, naturally. Very the odds ratio.

326
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:38,720
And I'm going to pick the one that is. Yeah.

327
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:41,870
I'm going to be the one with the smallest as standard error.

328
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:45,200
So the smallest error be somewhere errors here.

329
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:49,400
Among all of this, the smallest one is 0.41.

330
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:53,870
Correct. So that's the a study that I'm using to create the lines.

331
00:35:54,200 --> 00:36:05,210
So based on these a study I have to give to create a line, I have to give the X value, which is going to be this value right here, -1.056.

332
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:11,030
So that number minus -1.05 seats is the one that I have here.

333
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:18,380
Right. And so manually and then the white ball on the V and then the.

334
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:22,580
Yeah. The Y dot. It's going to be zero. Is it always zero?

335
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:30,470
Yes, it's always zero. And then this low, which is also very important for 0.51.

336
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:41,060
Because if you do one over 1.96, where the 1.96 is the 95 percentile of standard normal distribution.

337
00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:44,720
So one over dot it's 0.51.

338
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:46,490
So that's where this comes from.

339
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:56,300
And that creates a line with the 95% confidence interval based on the smallest based on the paper with the smallest is standup error.

340
00:36:56,780 --> 00:37:04,040
Does that make sense? Aisha? QUESTION So far, I don't see these things.

341
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:14,140
We have to go through other things. So in general, for your homework, a step that we need to do to get here first.

342
00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:19,980
Create the data that means. He's called.

343
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:25,780
We need to change these lines based on, you know, the actual table for your homework.

344
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:34,720
So once you create the data, then run this code to create a table that has.

345
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:39,170
Natural logarithm of the odds ratio is standard error.

346
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:49,120
Once you create this stable. Show us the paper with a smaller system, that error in this case newspaper.

347
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:54,550
And then copy and paste this number. Copy and paste B -1.05.

348
00:37:54,560 --> 00:38:02,020
But you know, with the new data, yes, it is X and that's it.

349
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:06,879
The rest should be the same because it's a 95% confidence interval.

350
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:14,710
So the 1.96 is not going to change. If we change the papers, if we change the data, the 1.96 is going to remain the same.

351
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:20,230
Does that make sense? Questions so far.

352
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:29,830
Yes. In the homework. One of the papers, the numerator and denominator of both protein.

353
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:34,120
So it gets 0 to 1 of the values.

354
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:38,410
So says, wouldn't it make more sense?

355
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:44,590
Um. Yeah, that's for like the other parts for the funnel part.

356
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:50,250
Hmm. Matter. Because it's early and then one day and.

357
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:54,820
And I got the same number as much as possible.

358
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:01,480
Just got to have them. Do we have a paper with.

359
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:04,720
Let me see that. Can I check that? Just one for them.

360
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:13,400
That may seem. I know what you mean.

361
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:20,889
This is not the purpose of having sex like it is.

362
00:39:20,890 --> 00:39:26,230
This. This is problem.

363
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:29,260
What? Yeah. It's just not for me.

364
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:39,520
Let me check. Just.

365
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:53,560
Oh, no, no, no, no.

366
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:58,350
Oh, yeah. Mm hmm. Mm hmm.

367
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:10,050
Yes. So that's a great question. I think maybe Dr. Muradian mentioned this in class, but in that case.

368
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:18,300
So in the homework, tons of paper has like 13 over 13, which means that one of these sales is going to be zero and that produces an error in SAS.

369
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:22,680
So what you can do is just add point five to each of the sets.

370
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:33,210
One day and one still. The important thing is that I don't like in the title table.

371
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:36,830
Just don't have that to support either one.

372
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:41,060
But this point five should be good. Does that make sense?

373
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:49,010
So like, if you've constructed to write your table in, that's your cell instead of us, you'll just add 2.5 and then make sure you have it at some.

374
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:54,230
Does that make sense? So that's all that says. Meaning problem.

375
00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:02,470
Anyone. Does anyone have a question about that particular problem in the homework?

376
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:11,800
He repeated this. Yes. So in the homework, when you are creating the final block, one of the papers has 13 over 30,

377
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:17,350
which means that when you are creating the title table, one of the cells is going to be zero.

378
00:41:18,370 --> 00:41:26,080
That creates a problem when you are using source. Then when we are going to solve it in this case is just instead of adding that as a zero, just 0.5.

379
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:30,870
All right. I'm 1.5 miles.

380
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:35,220
I'm sorry. 1.5 to 0. Yeah, because it needs to.

381
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:39,840
Exactly. Yes. That should solve the problem. Let me know if it does not.

382
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:45,300
But, you know, if you saw us, we just immediately after this does that to solve it.

383
00:41:45,310 --> 00:41:54,920
Okay. That don't know if she didn't.

384
00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:59,910
I'll make sure she mentioned something about that in the next lecture.

385
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:19,810
All right. So that's that's everything we're going to do for on all the seasons, like in the first hallway.

386
00:42:20,350 --> 00:42:24,010
Another big part of the Friday's homework. It's the rock here.

387
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:30,340
Yes. So. We're going to first review what that means.

388
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:36,460
Then we're going to do an example, and then we're going to see how to work through that example in SAS on people.

389
00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:40,720
Okay. Have you already covered this in class?

390
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:49,610
Okay. So let's say we have a two by two table fight.

391
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:54,400
So when I have a selection table, I have a lot of measurements that are very interesting.

392
00:42:54,430 --> 00:42:57,430
One of them is the odds ratio. I don't know why.

393
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:00,880
It's, for example, the sensitivity, which is the true positive rate,

394
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:09,880
which is a calculated that's a over A-plus C, so this cell of a B cell through a positive rate.

395
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:19,450
And then we also have something that is called the specificity, which is the true negative rate in which faith is B over sleep, B plus Z.

396
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:27,150
Those two values are very important because those two values are the ones that create the rock core.

397
00:43:27,790 --> 00:43:31,720
So what is that? What is what is the.

398
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:38,830
So let's say, for example, I have a study where I'm facing people for Alzheimer's.

399
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:42,640
So I have so far on time processes.

400
00:43:42,670 --> 00:43:48,729
Normally what doctors do is they create a test and that this will give you a number between,

401
00:43:48,730 --> 00:43:55,330
I think it's one and four which time like, you know, probably a later life on Cyprus.

402
00:43:55,930 --> 00:44:00,250
So in this case, let's say I did this study and these are the results.

403
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:07,140
So, for example, this means that there are 222 patients with Alzheimer's.

404
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:14,290
That is, score one in that test and there are 73 patients when they don't have Alzheimer's.

405
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:17,860
That is score one in that test. Okay.

406
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:23,290
So what we want to do now is create a rough card based on this.

407
00:44:29,410 --> 00:44:34,270
What we do without rock core is just to move a threshold.

408
00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:37,840
The threshold is normally the threshold for acceptance,

409
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:46,600
which I may say that case like have devices or do not has the disease according to my measurement device.

410
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:55,540
So in this case, for example, I can create four different thresholds, so I can say for a score greater than one,

411
00:44:56,320 --> 00:45:05,620
if you score greater than one greater or equal than one in that test, according to my test, you have Alzheimer's, but not just one threshold.

412
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:10,930
I can set the threshold to two, which means for me, for me, as a practical doctor,

413
00:45:11,230 --> 00:45:19,600
I think that if you score two or more than doing this, then according to Mark, this you have Alzheimer's or like early in.

414
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:24,230
Yeah, every Alzheimer's. And then you can move that threshold.

415
00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:33,329
So maybe it's three or maybe four. So for each of the thresholds, we can create a two way two table, and then for each of the 20 tables,

416
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:39,239
we can create a specificity on sensitivity, and then we can follow those numbers.

417
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:47,670
And so when we create a lot of sensitivity and specificity for each of the thresholds, then that's called a rock card.

418
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:51,880
Does that make sense? Sue.

419
00:45:51,910 --> 00:45:59,660
Okay. Um. So. Oh, no, I have something.

420
00:46:01,930 --> 00:46:06,370
Okay. So how do we create this rough card using source?

421
00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:14,290
First thing we are going to do is to create a data set. So this is my results of my experiment.

422
00:46:14,770 --> 00:46:21,340
Then how likely is the lasting success of first use data?

423
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:24,790
You know, that's the procedure. This is the name of my data center.

424
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:34,480
For some reason, I decided to call it white one. And then what I'm going to do is do I do it right just to create.

425
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:38,500
So, for example, I have a 22 here.

426
00:46:38,950 --> 00:46:49,480
What I would love to do is that in my data set, I have 22 lines that says there's the score, one Alzheimer's, 122 lines of those.

427
00:46:49,810 --> 00:46:55,060
And then I want also 23 lines that has a score one, Alzheimer's zero.

428
00:46:55,330 --> 00:46:59,280
And then I want 77 lines with a score to Alzheimer's.

429
00:46:59,290 --> 00:47:05,620
Yes. So that's how the data set would look. So like, instead of doing that manually, because I'm not going to do it 22 times,

430
00:47:05,890 --> 00:47:09,490
I'm just going to create a which is just like a procedure that iterates.

431
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:22,150
I'm doing 40 so do from 1 to 22 Y until 22 because I'm going to create 22 lines that has a score, Festus score one, Alzheimer's one.

432
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:29,620
And then so those this thing basically I'm he I'm telling us do this thing 22 times.

433
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:35,860
And this thing is great about who is with nine is caught and assigned in number

434
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:40,750
one because I have a score one here and then create a variable let it score.

435
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:46,800
Ulzheimer assigned a value one. So for me, one, it's you have Alzheimer's zeros.

436
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:50,410
The person doesn't have Alzheimer's. And then that's it.

437
00:47:50,590 --> 00:47:55,550
And then end and then go to the other cell and do exactly the same.

438
00:47:55,930 --> 00:48:04,750
So for the other side, so it's basically the same do from 1 to 73, y 73, because I have 73 people here.

439
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:13,060
But in this case a score is one, but inside versus zero and then a score one, Alzheimer's two, so on and so forth.

440
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:18,600
Until you get well, zero, you don't have to do it because there's no lines until you get to this.

441
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:22,660
Do one, two, three. Alzheimer's one is score for.

442
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:28,220
Does that make sense? That's how you create something. Oh yes.

443
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:36,320
Once you have created that data set to the rough core, we are going to use from logistic.

444
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:44,840
So logistic data and then the name of the data set, remember that I pulled in y one and then influx.

445
00:48:44,990 --> 00:48:52,010
So slots equals graph so you automatically create drug cards, model Alzheimer's.

446
00:48:52,010 --> 00:48:57,230
This is just the name of the model that I'm going to do it. Model Alzheimer's and event equal one.

447
00:48:57,320 --> 00:49:02,660
This is very important because remember, that's how I decided to create the vast dataset,

448
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:08,680
is that if a person has a little timer, I'm going to call it as one, if you will, for some reason.

449
00:49:08,690 --> 00:49:13,470
Want to change that. For example, he's not one, but you'll then see how you will change it as you.

450
00:49:13,610 --> 00:49:15,530
Okay. That's just how I created the thing.

451
00:49:15,530 --> 00:49:24,920
I'll say if a person on first timer's remember here, if a person has Alzheimer's, the way I'm putting it is as someone.

452
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:34,230
So I like them. Later, when I'm creating the rapport, I have modern Alzheimer's and the event is 1 to 1 because that's the event.

453
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:43,820
That's how encoding equal to one and then a score, which is the other variable dividing all of that I'm moving that threshold for.

454
00:49:44,270 --> 00:49:52,940
And then here this is completely unnecessary, but I'm saving the results in an output call, a drug results.

455
00:49:53,540 --> 00:50:00,070
Once you open that hopefully in cells, you should have these time off by card.

456
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:11,720
So for each of the threshold, one, two, three and four, remember that we have four levels office for which each level is one threshold.

457
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:17,360
We have a two by two table. From that two by two table, I have the specificity and the sensitivity.

458
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:21,470
So I have one, two, three, four there and that's it.

459
00:50:21,710 --> 00:50:26,180
I'm about zero questions so far.

460
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:35,650
Yes. Can you point to like where did you say there were kids during the.

461
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:39,790
Oh, this year it's the first one.

462
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:49,179
Actually, if you if you are reading the tables, one, two, three, four, then this is one.

463
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:53,080
This is one. This is this is one. This is two or more.

464
00:50:53,590 --> 00:50:58,090
This is what makes 43 or more. And this is what this calls for these six.

465
00:50:58,540 --> 00:51:07,390
I actually recommend if you want to study, just try to create yourself for four for one of the thresholds, for example,

466
00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:17,319
is for rate of entry that you want to table and then calculate yourselves the specificity of the sensitivity and just make sure

467
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:28,960
it's somewhere between a specificity between one is a specific reaction between like 0.05 and the sensitivity level less than 2.4.

468
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:37,330
So like, you make sure, like you understand me how to do this though of these kind of things by hand, I mean so big problem.

469
00:51:38,230 --> 00:51:46,200
It's 45. 52. So I have to go because I have a visa works and you have a lot of other things to do.

470
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:51,720
But I know we didn't finish. I'm sorry, but I needed to explain.

471
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:56,530
You know, that time, everything. But do not worry.

472
00:51:56,550 --> 00:52:00,060
Homework is due until Sunday, the 18th.

473
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:03,720
So you still have time, right? You still have some time.

474
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:10,680
So please contact me. Send me emails. My email address is in this presentation.

475
00:52:11,310 --> 00:52:18,000
Please come by your office hours on. Let me know if you need help, if there is some questions.

476
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:24,930
So yeah, that's it. I promise I'll try to finish the whole presentation next time.

477
00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:30,440
Within the time. Any questions? Oh.

478
00:52:34,070 --> 00:52:36,670
Oh. One.
