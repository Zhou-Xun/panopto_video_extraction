00:00:10,105 --> 00:00:14,406
Hey, this is Matt Zawistowski,
back to talk about mixed models for

2
00:00:14,406 --> 00:00:16,375
longitudinal data analysis.

3
00:00:16,375 --> 00:00:21,710
In previous lectures we introduced
the random intercept mixed model.

4
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:26,606
In this lecture, we're going to extend
that model by introducing an additional

5
00:00:26,606 --> 00:00:33,020
random effect term, one that will allow
for between subject differences in slopes.

6
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:37,899
As a reminder, the random intercept mixed
model was introduced as a means to account

7
00:00:37,899 --> 00:00:43,110
for within subject correlation of outcomes
due to repeated measure sampling.

8
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:48,050
Conceptually, the random intercept model
assumes that each subject has its own

9
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:50,457
subject-specific regression line.

10
00:00:50,457 --> 00:00:53,679
And that the intercepts between
these lines can differ, but

11
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:59,100
they are parallel and also parallel
to the population regression line.

12
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,922
This was achieved by including
the random intercept term b sub 0 i to

13
00:01:03,922 --> 00:01:05,620
the regression model.

14
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:10,515
As the i in the model indicates, this
term differs by subject, allowing each

15
00:01:10,515 --> 00:01:15,805
subject to have a unique intercept for
their subject-specific regression line.

16
00:01:15,805 --> 00:01:19,469
But again, this model assumes that
these lines are all parallel,

17
00:01:19,469 --> 00:01:22,660
with the common slope of beta 1.

18
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:27,254
However, the assumption of parallel
subject-specific lines might not

19
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:28,891
always hold in practice.

20
00:01:28,891 --> 00:01:31,118
In fact, it is fairly common for

21
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:35,994
the slopes of the subject-specific
lines to vary between subjects.

22
00:01:35,994 --> 00:01:40,192
Meaning they each have slightly different
trajectories from each other and

23
00:01:40,192 --> 00:01:42,365
from the population regression line.

24
00:01:42,365 --> 00:01:47,150
A visual inspection of the data can
help determine if this is the case.

25
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:50,562
Like the subject-specific
differences in intercept,

26
00:01:50,562 --> 00:01:54,191
the differences in slope are not
really random error noise.

27
00:01:54,191 --> 00:01:56,618
So we would want to account for
this in the model,

28
00:01:56,618 --> 00:02:00,580
rather than simply attributing it
to the random error component.

29
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:04,461
We can accomplish this by including
an additional random effect term to

30
00:02:04,461 --> 00:02:07,920
the random intercept mixed model.

31
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,890
Let's construct a random intercept,
random slope mixed effect regression

32
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:18,660
model that allows for subject
variation in both intercept and slope.

33
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:22,906
We'll start with the standard linear
regression equation that related

34
00:02:22,906 --> 00:02:28,130
the outcome of interest to a linear
equation of time and a random error.

35
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:32,882
To this model we have already seen how
adding a random intercept term allows for

36
00:02:32,882 --> 00:02:38,480
between-subject variation in
the subject-specific regression lines.

37
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,138
Remember that we make the assumption that
the random intercept terms follow a normal

38
00:02:43,138 --> 00:02:47,544
distribution, and we estimate the standard
deviation of that distribution.

39
00:02:47,544 --> 00:02:51,029
This assumption effectively
partitions the overall error,

40
00:02:51,029 --> 00:02:55,519
or the differences between the observed
outcomes and the outcomes predicted by

41
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:01,990
the red population regression line, into
subject specific error and random error.

42
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:06,692
We can next add an additional random
effect term called the random slope term

43
00:03:06,692 --> 00:03:08,790
to our mixed model.

44
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:13,003
This model now has two random
effect terms for each subject,

45
00:03:13,003 --> 00:03:15,735
a random intercept and a random slope.

46
00:03:15,735 --> 00:03:20,847
The random slope term, b sub 1 i,
quantifies the difference in slope between

47
00:03:20,847 --> 00:03:25,899
the population regression line and
the regression line for the ith subject.

48
00:03:25,899 --> 00:03:31,377
This random intercept, random slope
mixed model now allows the subject

49
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:36,245
specific regression lines to vary
both in intercept and slope.

50
00:03:36,245 --> 00:03:41,864
The terms in the random intercept, random
slope model can be neatly organized so

51
00:03:41,864 --> 00:03:45,670
that intercept and
slope terms are grouped together.

52
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:50,665
We have two fixed effect terms,
one for intercept and one for slope.

53
00:03:50,665 --> 00:03:56,310
These are population parameters that
define the red population regression line.

54
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:59,574
We also have two random effect
terms in the model, which

55
00:03:59,574 --> 00:04:05,880
facilitates the between subject variation
from the population regression line.

56
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:10,526
Finally, we have the random error term
that captures within subject variation or

57
00:04:10,526 --> 00:04:14,368
the variation of points about
their respective subject-specific

58
00:04:14,368 --> 00:04:16,950
regression lines.

59
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:19,341
Like the random intercept mixed model,

60
00:04:19,341 --> 00:04:23,634
this model partitions overall variation
between observed outcomes and

61
00:04:23,634 --> 00:04:29,810
predicted outcomes into between
subject and within subject components.

62
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:34,524
With the addition of the random slope
term we need to revisit our modeling

63
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:35,536
assumptions.

64
00:04:35,536 --> 00:04:40,033
Recall that for the random intercept model
we made the following assumptions, 1,

65
00:04:40,033 --> 00:04:42,590
the random errors are independent.

66
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:46,128
2, the random errors
are normally distributed, 3,

67
00:04:46,128 --> 00:04:49,678
the random intercepts are also
normally distributed.

68
00:04:49,678 --> 00:04:55,490
And 4, the random intercepts and
the random errors are independent.

69
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:59,742
To those we will further assume
that the random slopes also follow

70
00:04:59,742 --> 00:05:04,220
a normal distribution with
standard deviation sigma b1.

71
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:08,965
Like the random intercepts, we will
estimate the parameter sigma b1 rather

72
00:05:08,965 --> 00:05:12,470
than the individual random slope terms.

73
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:14,326
Also like the random intercepts,

74
00:05:14,326 --> 00:05:18,740
we will assume the random slopes
are independent of the random errors.

75
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:22,969
However, we will allow for correlation
between the random effect terms.

76
00:05:22,969 --> 00:05:27,514
That is, the random effects will follow
a bivariate normal distribution.

77
00:05:27,514 --> 00:05:31,405
And we will need to estimate the
correlation between the random intercept

78
00:05:31,405 --> 00:05:34,410
and slope within a subject.

79
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:38,975
That was a lot, so let's clarify what
exactly we need to estimate in the random

80
00:05:38,975 --> 00:05:42,310
intercept, random slope mixed model.

81
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:45,263
We now have six parameters for this model.

82
00:05:45,263 --> 00:05:50,876
The two fixed effect population
parameters beta 0 and beta 1.

83
00:05:50,876 --> 00:05:55,855
Three variance terms, the variance of
the random errors, sigma e squared,

84
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:58,768
and the variances of
the random intercept and

85
00:05:58,768 --> 00:06:04,140
random slopes, sigma b0 squared and
sigma b1 squared respectively.

86
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:07,456
And if we allow for
correlation between the random effects,

87
00:06:07,456 --> 00:06:09,603
we will also estimate the covariance or

88
00:06:09,603 --> 00:06:15,440
equivalently the correlation between
random intercepts and random slopes.

89
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,673
With that we've now extended
are mixed model to include

90
00:06:18,673 --> 00:06:21,950
both random intercepts and random slopes.

91
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:25,617
This provides a more general framework for
us to account for

92
00:06:25,617 --> 00:06:31,060
between subject variation and
subject-specific regression lines.

93
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:35,057
Importantly, we have further partitioned
variation about the population

94
00:06:35,057 --> 00:06:36,710
regression line.

95
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:39,199
By accounting for differences in slopes,

96
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:44,160
we further reduce error attributed
to within subject random error.

97
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,311
Note that not all repeated measure
data will require a random slope.

98
00:06:48,311 --> 00:06:51,624
Visual inspection of individual
trajectory curves and

99
00:06:51,624 --> 00:06:58,283
analysis of model-based residuals can help
determine if random slopes are justified.
