1
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:23,370
Oh yeah, we are similar, but you know, I don't know what else you'll end up being around.

2
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:33,140
Those are just not starting parents.

3
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:46,410
I really like starting. I'll start generous parents because I wasn't expecting.

4
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:51,989
So I'm like I was interested in talking about I don't care.

5
00:00:51,990 --> 00:01:04,830
I sit on the textbooks one day sometimes and I think that was great and it makes me like I try not to have.

6
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:15,840
At one time I was so angry, but like I said, it was like I was.

7
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:29,580
So I think it's been something that I didn't like that already exists.

8
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:36,010
So, I mean, I was gonna say yes.

9
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:41,460
So you take notes and not. Yeah, yeah.

10
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:55,200
Well, I guess I just like doing it.

11
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:59,129
I want you know what?

12
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:13,680
You know, I'm just trying to think of any other store would have and like to see where I wanted to try strawberry vanilla and cherry vanilla.

13
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:34,290
Basically, I told her that, you know, you just like you said, I think I would switch.

14
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:49,720
Maybe I'll just let me say assume that I feel like I could just appreciate the vintage for my comment.

15
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:06,810
I hope it's like it's nice meeting our expectations.

16
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:14,010
I just want to hear from the time nobody.

17
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:29,560
Like I know there's nothing that I was stupid things that I just got word this morning.

18
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:35,940
Yes. Yes, I did put it in there.

19
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:46,820
You were saying, you know, I don't know.

20
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:58,940
This is the first question. So do you think perusal all semester and some of you have questions about writing assignments and I answered them.

21
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:02,579
If you had continue to have questions, I can send me an email.

22
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:10,650
I can answer them on an individual basis. Um, the proof of course have been very good with you have gotten all ten points on every single assignment.

23
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:25,300
So next exam, one format I got that described on the campus site and that will become 19th when you return from fall break.

24
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:34,270
And then in terms of the next quiz that will be on Friday, it'll open up in the afternoon and that'll be due on the 10th.

25
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:43,790
Okay. So today we're going to be talking about gut hormones and for learning objectives.

26
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:54,490
I want you to understand the impact of the cannabis sector and the short term signals arising from the stomach and the small intestine.

27
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,370
Responses stretch as they fill with food.

28
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:06,260
Describe samples arrested genic and anorexia genic gut hormones.

29
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:15,950
And we talked a little bit about these. And when we're talking about the central nervous system, control of appetite and satiety and then,

30
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:20,629
um, and treatments, you've heard about ingredients in 630,

31
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:29,300
perhaps explain the role of increasing glucose homeostasis and then finally describe

32
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:34,310
the function of hormones produced in the pancreas and in the gut response to feeding.

33
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:45,919
So let's first start out with just an overview of these signals coming from the gut and coming from the McKenna receptors are short term.

34
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:53,120
In other words, their effects um, increase and resolve within minutes to hours.

35
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:59,810
Whereas the long term effectors of appetite were leptin and insulin and their

36
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:07,160
effects are more their points is affected by that the total adipose tissue mass.

37
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:21,200
So these signals first arise from the cannabis receptors that are activated as you ingest food and then there's

38
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:29,270
distension in the throat and the esophagus and these her and within minutes and resolved within minutes.

39
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:38,180
So your reward got in there. But the food or certainly part of that the short term influence in terms of it's

40
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:43,520
having an effect on whether or not you're going to continue eating something.

41
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:48,710
We talk a lot more about food or earlier. I'm not going to talk about it in today's lecture.

42
00:06:49,910 --> 00:07:03,650
Then there's the osmotic load that a food item might have on your gut and how it can influence the volume of fluid in your gastrointestinal tract.

43
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:07,970
So if you've ingested something that's high in concentration,

44
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:14,900
it's going to require quite a bit of fluid within the gut, and that can expand the volume of that gut.

45
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:24,510
And then there are in response to all macronutrients that are in the food that you eat.

46
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:33,100
There's hormones released in response to this. And we'll talk about each one of these as we walk through today's talk.

47
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:46,480
So the McCann receptors, they can inhibit feeding in the short term by just the act of mastication chewing,

48
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:55,700
and you get salivation and response to chewing food. You taste that particular food, and after you're eating something,

49
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:04,220
this sensation in your mouth has a very short term within within minutes to inhibit your response.

50
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:13,330
Some people chew gum in between meals, and this inhibits the desire to feeding.

51
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:22,970
Some people will drink water and to get the same type of sensation to inhibit desire to consume food.

52
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:32,780
And and interestingly enough, your brain is keeping track as you're eating up of how much volume of food is going into your body.

53
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:38,930
And you remember this in terms of how much you usually consume of this particular item.

54
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:49,730
And after food passes down your throat, into your esophagus, there's some distention there that activates these Makana receptors.

55
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:59,090
And then when it gets into your gut, into your stomach, your stomach wall is richly integrated as well as your small intestine,

56
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:09,680
with these kind of receptors that are very sensitive to changes in the volume within your gut.

57
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:14,240
And they inhibit feeding as they're activated.

58
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:24,010
So they're short lived. They resolve in this case in terms of MCAT or receptors, minutes and maybe hours.

59
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:33,670
So after you've ingested a meal, you feel really full. And part of that sensation of fullness is from the stretch within your gastrointestinal tract.

60
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:41,470
And then there are various strategies to enhance that sensation of fullness drinking lots of water,

61
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:48,970
drinking carbonated beverages, eating things that have a high osmotic load, but not a whole lot of class density like fiber.

62
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:57,550
All of these things can enhance the thinking of inhibitory effects of these maternal receptors.

63
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:16,389
So here is a diagram showing you these kind of receptor nerve endings here, and they are present within the small intestine and within the stomach.

64
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:21,700
And then you have the osmotic load that's from the nutrients in food.

65
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:30,340
And you have areas that are heavily innervated by fibers, afferent fibers from the vagus nerve.

66
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:40,490
And they're activated by the stretch the sense of expansion of these these tissues after eating.

67
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:47,150
And they the signals travel up the vagus nerve and they terminate, you know, those ganglion.

68
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:56,000
And then those those ganglion has extensions to the rejection section, say, to the ants,

69
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:05,870
the portion of the brain in the brain stem that plays an important role in inhibiting appetite and its nerve fibers terminate in the car,

70
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:12,770
brachial nuclei that we talked about, and that was the brain center that has this emergency circuit.

71
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:20,780
This is not an emergency circuit, but the same type of neural pathways use this track to inhibit feeding.

72
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:22,940
So this is what happens.

73
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:32,030
These actions of this stretch of the gastrointestinal tract going up to the brain stem and inhibiting feeding in the short term.

74
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:45,370
So in addition to this stretch, this sensation of fullness, you have other other things that can contribute to this,

75
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:51,880
either the desire to eat or the sensation of fullness that shuts down your appetite.

76
00:11:52,750 --> 00:12:01,120
And the first thing I'm going to talk about here in terms of something that stimulates your appetite is these rates of genic hormones.

77
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:07,240
So anorexia genic hormone is a hormone that promotes food intake.

78
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:15,879
So you'll hungry under the influence of anorexia genic hormones in the best described and characterized erector

79
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:24,970
genic hormone is grilled is produced in cells in your stomach the excess cells as you read less recently,

80
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:38,020
there have been others that have been proposed, but they have there's no consensus on whether or not these are physiologically important in humans.

81
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:44,350
So the paper that you read describes this insulin like peptide five,

82
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:54,010
and there doesn't seem recently there seem to be a consensus on whether or not this is an important pyrexia genic hormone in humans.

83
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:03,009
And interestingly enough, this particular hormone is produced by parasites within the colon and the rectum,

84
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:07,900
and it's at the very end of the gastrointestinal tract.

85
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:18,400
And the position of these cells in regard to their secretion of this hormone has been a subject of a lot of debate anyway.

86
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:22,990
This is not regarded as an important directive genic hormone.

87
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:37,090
In 2016, this other hormone as percent was described and discovered and it's thought to increase appetite.

88
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:43,930
And this particular one is really interesting in that it comes from the extracellular matrix.

89
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:55,680
And it is actually a fragment of the protein that forms the extracellular matrix, and it's thought to stimulate appetite.

90
00:13:56,490 --> 00:14:04,140
However, only one lab has been able to find that this particular hormone has this properties

91
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:11,190
and others have tried to replicate that research and have not shown the same effects.

92
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:19,530
So as it stands now, we only have one well-characterized orexin genic hormone in that structure.

93
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:36,900
So one is produced by these X8 cells in the stomach, so they have their position in the stomach wall.

94
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:42,780
And interestingly, they have this closed end structure.

95
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:46,910
So they're not exposed to anything within the stomach wall.

96
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:55,950
Right. So they're in the ilium, but their exposure to nutrients is through the basal lateral membrane.

97
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,780
So ghrelin is produced in these cells.

98
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:06,300
But in order for that hormone ghrelin to be activated, it has to be isolated.

99
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:15,510
And the isolation occurs through its attachment to a a carbon fatty acid.

100
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:23,970
So this eight carbon fatty acid attaches to Greenland and becomes isolated crown and then it becomes active.

101
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:28,800
How does that isolation occur? Where do those fatty acids come from?

102
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:32,639
Well, this is something that is being worked out.

103
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:41,160
It's not very clear, but potentially from the oxidation of lipids,

104
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:52,570
long chain fatty acids perhaps can be broken down into these great carbon fatty acids, and it gets into the circulation in the stomach.

105
00:15:52,620 --> 00:16:00,060
And this is how this fatty acid gets into the cells and causes this reaction.

106
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:09,570
You can have fatty acids being transported into these cells, but this is somewhat speculative in terms of how this happens.

107
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:15,780
Anyway, the thing you need to know is it's that X related relevance, active form of the hormone.

108
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:21,330
So here are two growing molecules.

109
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:38,260
One is isolated and less isolated. So you have an enzyme within the cells that's responsible for attaching this fatty acid molecule to relative

110
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:45,580
to a script and then says don't run over April o transferase certain code that's responsible for this action.

111
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:53,140
So this is the active form of the hormone and this is what is measured.

112
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:58,510
And to make this measurement in a lab or clinically, it's a little tricky.

113
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:07,450
You can't just take somebody serum. You have to take that serum and acidify it to stabilize the active form of of ghrelin.

114
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:14,920
So some of the earlier papers you see in the literature, they measure just just the total ghrelin.

115
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:19,810
And there's no attention paid to a selectively isolated ghrelin.

116
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:24,490
And there's quite a bit of variability in levels that are measured.

117
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:36,850
When it was realized that it's isolated ghrelin, that's the one that has a function of stimulating appetite with blood,

118
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:40,510
with preserved in a way that you can actually measure this active form of the hormone.

119
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:55,540
So look, like during the day in terms of ghrelin levels, well, it follows this pulsatile level that corresponds to your eating patterns.

120
00:17:56,410 --> 00:18:05,020
So ghrelin is highest in the morning when you wake up and after you eat breakfast, it declines rapidly.

121
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:09,099
So in terms of that pattern,

122
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:17,049
is that common across the board or does it change based on also like dietary habits and that if someone's skipping breakfast regularly,

123
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:21,640
maybe there isn't as much? You know, that's a really good question.

124
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:28,180
I don't I can't answer the question in terms of particular details about people's dietary patterns.

125
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:40,930
That's interesting question. I don't know. So it's it peaks at breakfast and then before lunch can go up again and then it'll decline.

126
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:49,720
And then at dinner time, it'll reach a peak as well and then go down at night and then climb back up again early in the morning.

127
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:57,640
Notice that throughout the day that the lowest level after a meal starts to increase.

128
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:03,040
Okay. And perhaps this explains why we're hungrier as the day goes on.

129
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:10,390
And again, in terms of dietary patterns, in terms of when you skip breakfast or whether you eat a particular food type,

130
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:13,780
whether it affects this pulsatile pattern, I'm not certain.

131
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:29,020
That's a good question. So the end, there are a lot more anorexia, genic hormones than than the one that we know about.

132
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:41,319
So these are coming from the gut in the form of seek gastric inhibitory peptide, GLP,

133
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:54,940
one Y and ox into moduli and these are produced by cells within the small intestine, all inhibit appetite within the pancreas.

134
00:19:54,970 --> 00:20:05,290
You have a number of hormones about insulin, of course, which is more of a long term signal that amylin glucagon and pancreatic peptide.

135
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:14,259
And then I've already told you some about pro-inflammatory cytokines these are these have a rectus genic effects but

136
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:21,610
they're not really they don't really act as hormones that regulate or inhibit appetite on a regular daily basis.

137
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:25,960
They're produced in response to trauma, infection or injury.

138
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:36,190
And they can have this inhibitory effect, but they're not really an important regulator of day to day sensation of hunger

139
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:42,440
and satiety into these more of those like emergency the emergency food.

140
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:59,650
They could be more of an emergency signal. Yes. So let's start with courses to Kenan.

141
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:08,550
And you've learned about this in your physiology classes and undergraduate courses to kind of do a lot of different things in regard to

142
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:21,080
digestion so the kind and is produced in the small intestine and it's going to be responding to the levels of macronutrients in your gut,

143
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:22,770
particularly fatty acids.

144
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:37,980
And it's going to stimulate the gallbladder to contract, to secrete and enhance the emulsification of lipids within the food.

145
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:46,680
So you're getting bile flowing into the duodenum by this action that does a lot in the

146
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:53,490
pancreas in terms of augmenting trypsin output and increases bicarbonate and fluid secretion

147
00:21:53,640 --> 00:22:02,020
from the ductal cells and thus this aids in the digestion of fluid in the stomach that

148
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:06,390
this is part of its inhibitory action in terms of its being an anorexia genic hormone.

149
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:16,440
It actually causes relaxation of the proximal stomach, so it slows down gastric emptying and in this way you still feel full.

150
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:20,790
And this is part of its anorexia genic actions.

151
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:30,870
It causes the contraction of the pilots laws. And this is another way that it can slow down gastric emptying.

152
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:37,130
And then there are receptors within that.

153
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:49,530
They can travel up to the brain stem that innervate the neurons, go to the ants and they give the sensation of satiety.

154
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:58,580
And again, there's this interplay between what's going on in the blood and what's in the gut and what's going on in the blood.

155
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:03,419
A sense by the central nervous system in the acute nucleus and you can do less,

156
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:10,110
are more sensitive to signals from the vagus nerve, depending on those long term signals from left.

157
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:27,900
LT So see the case response it increases in response to lipid in your gut in particular long chain fatty acids.

158
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:35,850
Often it limits meal size so it can, and when it's activated during a meal,

159
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:42,270
it can terminate the length of time or reduce the length of time in which you spend eating food because you start to feel food.

160
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:50,010
And the other actions and distribution is gastric empty.

161
00:23:52,860 --> 00:24:03,450
So this and again the action of C, c, k in the brain to inhibit feeding travels up the vagus nerve to the anti acid.

162
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:08,280
We've described that oftentimes earlier, but the effects are short lived.

163
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:20,820
So if you are looking at C, C, K as as a means to reduce some of these appetite over the long term, we find that that would be very unsuccessful.

164
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:33,690
Its effects are short lived, and you would compensate by eating smaller meals throughout the day and you would consume the same amount of food,

165
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:37,860
whether or not you were taking something that activated this pathway.

166
00:24:38,790 --> 00:25:01,700
And that's because its effects are short and. So many of these hormones are secreted from the same and terrorist sites here.

167
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:09,470
Here, here is entero. And this endocrine cell, I think, is shown here.

168
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:18,650
And the small intestine epithelium. And then here it shows you a summary of lipid uptake.

169
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:23,300
So you have triglycerides, it's broken down. You have long chain fatty acids.

170
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:36,829
And as a MONOGLYCERIDES being transported into the entire site, three fatty acid receptors, CB 36 fatty acid binding protein.

171
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:46,660
And you have these, they say glycerol molecules are all a cell transferase enzymes transporting elements

172
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:54,410
that are embedded in now into a micron across the small intestine epithelium.

173
00:25:55,490 --> 00:26:06,799
And these fatty acids, when subjected to somatic breakdown, give you an increase in the concentration of these lipids.

174
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:15,860
Now in the blood. And it's at the basal lateral side that these cells sense the presence of these lipids, indicating you've just eaten something.

175
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:22,790
And the concentration of these lipids can actually terminate a meal by activating these cells.

176
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:31,100
And these cells go on to produce causes declining and other types of anorexia, genic hormones.

177
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:42,350
So this is this is well described in terms of the function of C, C, K as an anorexia genic hormone.

178
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:48,590
And again, it's the fatty acids that seem to have the greatest impact on it's secretion.

179
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,230
So another gut hormone that's of great importance.

180
00:26:55,250 --> 00:27:07,020
It's this peptide why? Why? And this one is secreted by the L cells in the gut, and it's secreted in proportion to meal size.

181
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:13,910
So the bigger the meal that you consume, the more peptide y y is going to be produced in the gut for these cells.

182
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:23,149
And what you'll see over and over again is the same pattern of of these the way these enter antigenic parlance,

183
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:32,360
where they can stimulate a inhibitory pathway in the brain and they can slow down gastric emptying in this case.

184
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:41,990
Q Lice can circulate in the blood, and it can activate receptors that are present in the accurate nucleus.

185
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:47,569
So in this case, you have the Y receptors in the nucleus,

186
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:56,270
and it's going to this is a receptor that is expressed our nose and p y agouti related peptide neurons.

187
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:07,250
And what this hormone does is it blocks the synthesis of the neuropeptide Y from these particular neurons for acting centrally.

188
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:18,350
And when you give this instantaneously to humans in mice and inhibits appetite, but it also has other effects,

189
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:29,390
it can cause taste aversion, and it does reduce food intake, but it can change your preference for certain types of foods.

190
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:41,240
So this particular peptide as a therapeutic approach to inhibiting somebody's appetite for weight reduction or for whatever purpose,

191
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:47,720
you don't want to give something that can cause this taste aversion.

192
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:53,720
So it's not something that's being pursued as a potential therapeutic target.

193
00:28:57,230 --> 00:29:12,230
Because it may cause nausea as well. So one of the hormones you've never not heard very much about is this this hormone oxygen, oxygen to modulate.

194
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:18,200
And again, the same types of cells that have the ability to secrete all of these hormones.

195
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:28,670
So in addition to the small intestine, you have the colon producing this hormone as well that circulates in the blood.

196
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:34,010
And it's through its interaction with the base lateral side cells locally and

197
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:41,120
through distal effects and other tissues and organs that it that it works.

198
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:53,900
So it's secreted following a meal. It suppresses your appetite and food intake and it can have an impact on energy expenditure as well.

199
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:58,130
So here's a diagram that kind of summarizes the effects.

200
00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:06,230
There's a question mark next to some of these in which there's some controversy and whether whether it has the effects or not.

201
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:16,430
But what's certainly true is that often a modulate does act by inhibiting food intake, and it has central nervous system effects.

202
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:23,690
And it's thought through these pathways within the central nervous system that it can increase energy expenditure,

203
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:38,600
perhaps it increases insulin secretion, and then in the stomach it's thought to reduce ghrelin secretion and and reduce gastric emptying.

204
00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:41,420
So you'll see this pattern over and over again.

205
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:54,310
Anorexia, genic hormones inhibit the appetite and the perception of being hungry in the brain and slows down the GI tract.

206
00:30:54,350 --> 00:31:01,280
And in this case, it's slowing down the emptying of the stomach, getting a greater sensation of fullness.

207
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:07,910
Yeah, honey. Yes. So is this the only one that this energy expenditure in parallel with decreasing food intake.

208
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:15,470
Say that again. Is this the omega treatment that increases energy expenditure besides a decrease in food intake?

209
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:23,890
I don't know. I don't know for certain if there are others or if this is an exclusive function of this particular.

210
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:32,210
It doesn't increase energy expenditure significantly because if we have more expending more energy, we would be hungry.

211
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:34,690
So it has the opposite effect, you know.

212
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:46,910
So the effect on energy expenditure could be something like it can influence thyroid hormone secretion or synthesis or something like that.

213
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:51,470
But I don't know the exact pathways by which oxygen flatulence has this effect.

214
00:31:51,960 --> 00:32:05,180
I'm thinking. So you've got to hear a lot or you've heard a lot about and credence in particular, GOP one.

215
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:18,080
But the ingredients are important factors that are released by cells within the intestine that lower lactose and raise insulin levels.

216
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:24,740
And they have an effect centrally as well by inhibiting appetite.

217
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:31,310
So the two increments are gastric inhibitory peptide.

218
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:38,120
You might also hear this hormone referred to as glucose dependent insulin, atropine polypeptide.

219
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:47,540
They're both the same thing. And then the other increase is GLP one or glucagon like peptide one.

220
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:51,920
Both of these have this property, the release by and parasites.

221
00:32:53,810 --> 00:33:02,120
They can inhibit appetite centrally and they lower blood glucose by raising insulin secretion.

222
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:09,860
Let's first talk a little bit about gases inhibitory peptide.

223
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:15,710
This one is actually produced by a different cell type, the K cells within the small intestine.

224
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:21,990
And it affects the cells in the pancreas that the cells that produce insulin.

225
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:30,840
And it affects the brain and by inhibiting appetite. But it also has some systemic effects in bone and in the sense.

226
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:41,160
This particular hormone stimulates nutrient storage by stimulating glucose and lipid uptake through the action of insulin.

227
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:50,960
And it can activate lipoprotein, lipase and adipocytes as well.

228
00:33:53,180 --> 00:34:09,350
So an interesting finding in terms of exploring the role of GMP in mammalian physiology was work done with GFP receptor knockout mice,

229
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:16,460
mice that are put on a high fat diet like a 60% fat diet and gain a lot of weight.

230
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:25,070
So added and that of an adult mouse at eight weeks of age is probably 20 grams, maybe a little bit more, a little bit less.

231
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:33,890
And if you put them on a standard mouse chow, they might get pretty close to 30 grams at the end of their life.

232
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:44,960
If you put that same mouse on a high fat diet, 60% of calories from fat, that mouse will gain 44 grams and weight at least 60 grams.

233
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:53,220
If you do follow this procedure, creating a high fat diet to these knockout animals, they won't gain weight.

234
00:34:54,490 --> 00:34:59,600
So that's exactly how this works.

235
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:05,320
Know interesting. But they are they are resistant to a high fat diet.

236
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,460
Yeah. Underweight.

237
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:17,500
Or they would be normal weight and they just don't gain the same level of adiposity in the high five that they used to have.

238
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:27,010
Yeah. Yeah, they have a normal mouse weight, but that doesn't produce the high level of adiposity that you would see in a wild type animal.

239
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:40,839
Yeah. Can you just explain the nutrient storage because of its activating glycoprotein, LPL and Adipocytes, wouldn't it be like reducing that energy?

240
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:44,170
Is those lipids, those limpets are metabolized?

241
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:47,710
It would, but they're just being liberated.

242
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:52,450
So I'm just confused.

243
00:35:53,110 --> 00:36:01,030
It stimulates nutrient storage where there's a lot of detail that's mentioned that you don't need to worry about.

244
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:09,100
I think the main thing that you need to understand about gastric inhibitory peptide,

245
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:17,350
given that it is a new treatment and that it increases insulin secretion and this particular

246
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:29,680
peptide now is being its actions are being used as a therapeutic target for people with diabetes.

247
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:33,730
So type two diabetes are insulin resistant.

248
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:41,860
So you combine agonist with type agonist and a GLP one agonist.

249
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:50,860
Together, you can get somebody who is insulin resistant to produce more insulin and it helps regulate your blood glucose levels.

250
00:36:55,030 --> 00:37:03,520
So then the next in Creighton, which is probably the one that's received the most attention, is CLP one.

251
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:08,860
So JLP one is shown here being produced by the small intestine.

252
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:19,810
There are cells within the pancreas that produce GLP one as well, and it has these two really important effects.

253
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:25,030
It decreases appetite and it increases insulin secretion.

254
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:31,120
So it has a central effect of increasing or decreasing appetite,

255
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:40,820
and it has this increasing effect by increasing circulating insulin levels, and it can also reduce gastric emptying.

256
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:50,650
Again, the same kind of a thing where an anorexia genic hormone acts centrally and locally in the gastrointestinal tract to reduce or inhibit feeding.

257
00:37:52,360 --> 00:38:04,840
So you have more circulating insulin as a consequence of having an elevation of GLP one and has some other effects that are mentioned here.

258
00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:13,210
The main thing that you need to pay attention to is that it decreases appetite and increases insulin secretion.

259
00:38:13,810 --> 00:38:26,469
There have been a number of drugs now that have used GLP one as a way for it's or a similar molecule that's more stable.

260
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:33,250
And after you've been since it's been administered to you to have that effect to reduce your appetite,

261
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:40,990
increase insulin secretion and as a treatment for people who have type two diabetes,

262
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:52,000
now that eventually like that increases because as I mentioned, you're effective pancreas.

263
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,480
So it would be like a short term solution long term.

264
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:05,260
So there are other drugs sulfonylureas that have that effect, that increase in some secretion from the beta cells.

265
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:15,700
But this, because it's acting in other places, has been more successful in long term treatment of people with type two diabetes.

266
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:25,660
Another important effect of the GLP one agonist is that people who go on these drugs lose 5 to 10% of their body weight.

267
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:34,400
But what that does is that it increases insulin responsiveness, then it's more responsiveness now.

268
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:37,760
Makes it easier for these people to regulate their.

269
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:56,050
So the here's a diagram of the the glucagon like one peptide receptors within the brain.

270
00:39:57,340 --> 00:40:09,940
So you have g f you want to working locally in the intestine through the vagus nerve and then the brain stem, and then you have receptors.

271
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:21,040
Here's the yes, here's the area of the brain stem, all affecting areas in the brain that are responsive to GLP one.

272
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:26,740
So in the hypothalamus and where you see this little symbol, there's a receptor for GLP one.

273
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:36,040
So in different regions of the brain, the brain stem and the argument nucleus, the pair of ventricular nuclei,

274
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:43,659
you have receptors for g help you want and they enhance the anorexic genic effects.

275
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:51,309
So they activate the pumps car neurons which express this receptor and they can activate the Gavin neurons

276
00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:58,360
that can actually inhibit the erect allergenic effects from the Y ability related peptide hormones.

277
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:03,400
So ultimately, if you're on these drugs for a long period of time,

278
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:11,890
it not only raises insulin levels, but it decreases food intake and decreases body weight.

279
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:27,250
So this diagram, which was in your reading, kind of summarizes the and treatment effect.

280
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:40,540
So you have the small intestine epithelial cells shown here and then you have glucose entering cells through the glucose transporter, the stout t one.

281
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:48,729
And that glucose is transported across the epithelium within the small intestine,

282
00:41:48,730 --> 00:41:56,590
getting into the blood and the chase cells and the L cells also express these glucose transporters

283
00:41:57,100 --> 00:42:04,780
and they respond to that glucose level by secreting these hormones which circulate in the blood.

284
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:10,270
They reach the pancreas and this is a beta cell in the pancreas.

285
00:42:10,690 --> 00:42:17,500
Activate the receptors expressed on these cells and they secrete insulin in response to this and to mine.

286
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:20,770
To mine and and that can increase intracellular calcium as well.

287
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:25,720
All of these effects will lead to a greater amount of insulin secretion.

288
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:36,280
So if you have type two diabetes and you're insulin resistant, it raises the level of insulin and makes you more responsive to lowering blood glucose.

289
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:48,190
This drug is very effective and it you'll see many, many different trade names for this particular drug.

290
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:57,530
I'll talk a bit more about these GLP one agonists when we talk about diabetes later in the semester.

291
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:01,760
And then drugs that are used for weight loss.

292
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:08,280
So have you heard about these? Have you heard about these GLP one receptor antagonists?

293
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:19,220
Sure. That's probably the most favored, most successful drugs to treat type two diabetes.

294
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:28,580
Right. This is a big deal now. So when you have a protein hormone and you're using it to treat somebody with diabetes, how is it administered?

295
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:33,220
Can you take a pill? DLP what would work? That works.

296
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:40,740
You have to ingest it. So an easy way to do this.

297
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:46,719
You give somebody the injector where they stick it in their leg and they're the one click and that one

298
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:52,570
click is correspond to a dose that's been shown to control the individual's platelet counts levels.

299
00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:56,050
So it's an injectable type of a drug.

300
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:03,970
And if you can do this in which the drug is stabilized somehow so that it circulates in your body over a long period of time,

301
00:44:04,990 --> 00:44:07,900
you only have to do it once a day or once a week.

302
00:44:08,110 --> 00:44:13,900
And I believe some of the newer preparations are once a week, and you can control your blood because of that.

303
00:44:14,410 --> 00:44:24,100
So GOP one receptor agonist are are hugely important in the treatment of type two diabetes.

304
00:44:24,970 --> 00:44:33,350
Yeah. Wouldn't individual be given that like as a first resort after being diagnosed with type two or what they like try and

305
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:42,520
how you start out you would start out somebody with type two diabetes on metformin and then if that doesn't over time,

306
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:46,330
you know that the effects of metformin aren't durable.

307
00:44:46,870 --> 00:44:52,390
So a few years in, they'll be given another drug, maybe a sulfonylurea drug.

308
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:55,810
And over time, that might be a factor.

309
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:59,860
They'll be given a third drug by this particular drug.

310
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:07,570
So everybody's different. And there are protocols on how to add drugs to the treatment protocol.

311
00:45:08,050 --> 00:45:09,940
And then that can get really complicated.

312
00:45:10,270 --> 00:45:16,120
And you have to watch these people really closely and monitor their blood glucose to make sure that you're not overdosing.

313
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:23,440
Yeah. So are the agonists, for example, in the structure of GLP one factor?

314
00:45:24,130 --> 00:45:29,890
Yes, exactly. But they're stabilized in such a way that they stay in circulation for a longer period of time.

315
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:46,200
So this is just a diagram. I don't want you to memorize this, but I want you to know that the parent molecule of food sovereignty,

316
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:52,810
I'll pick one and oxygen to modulate is this molecule.

317
00:45:52,830 --> 00:46:04,409
I hear glucagon and depending on the site of cleavage of these of this particular protein and the

318
00:46:04,410 --> 00:46:08,430
enzymes that you have present in the different cell types will give you the different products.

319
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:17,280
So from the same parent molecule, you can get glucagon, you can get oxygen modulated, or you can get GLP one.

320
00:46:26,490 --> 00:46:33,390
So now let's talk about pancreatic hormones, insulin, Amylin, glucagon and pancreatic polypeptide.

321
00:46:33,870 --> 00:46:43,739
We talked an awful lot about ah, you've heard an awful lot about insulin in terms of it's playing a critical role in regulating blood glucose

322
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:52,559
levels and it increases in response to circulating glucose and it allows the cells within the muscle,

323
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:55,020
liver and adipose tissue to take up glucose.

324
00:46:57,970 --> 00:47:05,379
The amount of insulin that you have circulating in your body is proportional to the amount of adipose tissue that you have,

325
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:11,650
kind of like leptin, but much less potent than leptin in terms of its inhibitory effect on appetite.

326
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:23,050
And then you do have receptors within the nucleus now that can inhibit, in this case, the neurons and inhibit appetite.

327
00:47:23,830 --> 00:47:26,890
Leptin is much more potent in its effects. To do this.

328
00:47:29,690 --> 00:47:36,520
Himalayan. Or it's also been referred to as this i a p p molecule.

329
00:47:37,210 --> 00:47:45,720
I am on polypeptide. This is another hormone that's secreted by the same cells that secrete insulin.

330
00:47:46,590 --> 00:47:51,270
It's a hormone that can decrease blood glucose.

331
00:47:51,280 --> 00:48:00,060
And if you have a drug that mimics this molecule, that can actually serve as a weight loss treatment.

332
00:48:00,990 --> 00:48:06,450
So gambling reduces blood glucose levels and inhibits appetite as well.

333
00:48:06,810 --> 00:48:17,790
And there were some early trials looking at some pharmacologic preparations of this particular hormone as a treatment for weight loss.

334
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:25,530
And I don't believe that the Amylin, the medics have entered the marketplace,

335
00:48:25,530 --> 00:48:33,569
but for a long time there was a high level of interest in creating a drug that was like this that would activate

336
00:48:33,570 --> 00:48:40,740
the Amylin receptors and lower blood glucose and get through type two diabetes and induce weight loss.

337
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:50,010
And this was administered over a long period of time. So if there was a commercial interest, do you think there were findings to support that?

338
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:58,800
So I think I think that this particular class of drugs got to maybe the.

339
00:49:00,570 --> 00:49:11,790
Third in the categories. Now it got two widespread clinical trials, but for one reason or another never made it to work.

340
00:49:11,790 --> 00:49:18,600
Approved for treatment. The. And I can't remember the reason.

341
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:22,780
Well, we'll cover that again when we talk about pharmacologic treatment.

342
00:49:24,370 --> 00:49:33,729
So glucagon, glucagon, this is a this hormone that's released in response to hypoglycemia and and some other things.

343
00:49:33,730 --> 00:49:39,370
The alpha cells within the pancreas now that has the glucagon has many different effects shown here.

344
00:49:40,090 --> 00:49:45,340
It can reduce food intake. It can increase insulin secretion.

345
00:49:45,790 --> 00:49:54,010
And it it acts in the liver to break down like a joint and put out more glucose to

346
00:49:54,280 --> 00:50:00,610
kind of increase glucose levels when you're when you're experiencing hypoglycemia.

347
00:50:01,570 --> 00:50:09,880
It has other effects mentioned here as well. So I think that increase food intake because we have two causes of death.

348
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:16,510
Can you say that again? So it's increased food intake because we have low dose levels.

349
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:21,840
So should it should it increase?

350
00:50:21,870 --> 00:50:26,620
Yeah, because we have low dose. And so we have to eat more.

351
00:50:28,310 --> 00:50:35,240
So this scenario makes sense.

352
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:45,559
But as far as I know it, it actually glucagon levels actually inhibit appetite because they're releasing glucose from the liver.

353
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:50,330
So then they would restore your blood glucose levels, your.

354
00:50:55,690 --> 00:51:01,900
So they prevent prevent high speed hypoglycemia is the right thing to do.

355
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:10,780
So there's the other inhibitory peptide produced by the pancreas.

356
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:17,380
Here is this pancreatic polypeptide. And again, this one is produced by the addict's Langerhans.

357
00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:25,330
Um, it, it increases, it remains elevated for hours after a meal.

358
00:51:25,630 --> 00:51:35,260
Ah, in response to cc k levels it can actually increase in response to short term exercise and it can inhibit appetite.

359
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:38,589
If you were to inhibit this, I give this example.

360
00:51:38,590 --> 00:51:49,120
Initially you'd find a number of effects that yes, it can reduce food intake and its actions are have been shown to work centrally.

361
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:58,570
So it's going to act on areas within the brain stem within actually outside of the blood brain barrier in the area of posture.

362
00:51:59,050 --> 00:52:08,200
Um, it can also activate the Y receptors in the lateral hypothalamus and the ventromedial hypothalamus.

363
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:16,120
So different areas in the brain in which polypeptide, ah, pancreatic peptide has its activity.

364
00:52:17,020 --> 00:52:21,610
And then locally, this hormone inhibits gastric motility.

365
00:52:22,910 --> 00:52:30,950
Interestingly, in people who have anorexia nervosa, they found that the level of pancreatic polypeptide is actually elevated.

366
00:52:33,380 --> 00:52:41,240
And then and with syndromic situations such as and prior to really syndrome, it's actually decreased.

367
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:49,950
So you'll have lower levels in particular anorexia, genic hormone produced in people with really simple.

368
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:55,010
Just as far as like with the the. And is it.

369
00:52:56,750 --> 00:53:04,879
Do you know if this was done in a like a cross sectional type thing or did they just determine causality like it was it was

370
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:16,310
the and the cause of the elevated levels or was the elevated levels a predisposition do so is this I don't know the details,

371
00:53:16,310 --> 00:53:24,140
but I saw as far as I know it was more of a um, let's compare the levels of pancreatic peptide in people who have,

372
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:29,450
who don't have and, and people who do have a and and they found that they were actually different.

373
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:36,880
But in terms of a causal relationship, that would be really difficult to determine.

374
00:53:41,570 --> 00:53:51,560
So one of the things that has received lots of attention of late is the role of the gut microbiota in health and disease.

375
00:53:52,220 --> 00:54:01,040
And there's this idea that if we maintain a healthy diet, we can maintain a healthy microbiota, and that will serve us well,

376
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:09,350
because the microbiota will produce metabolic products that have physiologic effects that promote health.

377
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:19,650
And one of the things there's been there have been a lot of lots of work in this area, and that's short chain fatty acids,

378
00:54:20,250 --> 00:54:28,740
um, uh, shown here have received a lot of attention in terms of their modulatory effects.

379
00:54:29,190 --> 00:54:35,040
And in this case, its effects on the secretion of gut hormones.

380
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:39,810
So here's an entire site.

381
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:50,330
Now that's cell. And in this case, the proposed mechanism is an epigenetic one where you have a, um,

382
00:54:51,060 --> 00:55:00,180
an active mechanism where you're looking at histone modification that results in, um, secretion of, of p y.

383
00:55:01,470 --> 00:55:11,820
And you also get other types of hormones one to perhaps CLP two, which has similar effects that you want in that they inhibit appetite.

384
00:55:12,630 --> 00:55:22,350
And it's thought that the byproducts of the are the metabolites, that the microbiota are responsible to suffer some of these effects.

385
00:55:24,150 --> 00:55:29,490
Um, there have been a lot of studies looking at these short chain fatty acids.

386
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:41,490
But there are other metabolites here showing Indole having a similar effect on these parasites ability to secrete these gut hormones.

387
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:45,910
And then this is a diagram showing you.

388
00:55:46,230 --> 00:55:55,799
Yes, the lipopolysaccharide that will be on the surface of these bacteria getting through the end of the ilium, activating a toll like receptor,

389
00:55:55,800 --> 00:56:04,800
which is something that would produce an inflammatory cascade affecting the cell's ability to secrete these endocrine factors as well.

390
00:56:06,150 --> 00:56:13,620
So that showing a cause and effect relationship with the microbiota is challenging as well.

391
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:22,770
And the way this type of research has been done is to use, you know, biotic, biotic mice.

392
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:29,370
These mice are not only pathogen free, but sterile animals,

393
00:56:29,730 --> 00:56:38,940
and they're kept in a sterile facility and they have no microorganisms in their bodies and their physiology is a bit different.

394
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:46,259
So it's different through that type of research that we've appreciated the importance

395
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:52,500
of the gut microbiota and the byproducts of the microbiota in health and disease.

396
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:59,040
Now, demonstrating or using that these ideas in humans is quite complicated.

397
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:06,900
So you have to have the right combination of microorganisms in your gut to begin with.

398
00:57:07,170 --> 00:57:13,680
And if you don't changing it, it's difficult because you have to feed it the right kind of nutrients,

399
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:18,690
right things that aren't digested to support that if the bacteria aren't there to begin with.

400
00:57:18,870 --> 00:57:27,540
And where are you going to get them from into what's known as a microbiome transplant, which is kind of gross.

401
00:57:27,570 --> 00:57:33,930
And sometimes it's the outcomes have been involved and sometimes they've been beneficial.

402
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:40,320
So using this idea and human medicine is challenging.

403
00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:52,500
What you can do is you can eat a diet that's high in fiber to support a healthier microbiome and benefit from these metabolites,

404
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:59,140
from these microorganisms. That may be challenging. Okay.

405
00:57:59,150 --> 00:58:06,170
So this is a summary slide showing you I've put in the squares here all of the

406
00:58:06,170 --> 00:58:12,709
different hormones that we've talked about today and their position in the GI tract.

407
00:58:12,710 --> 00:58:14,630
And there are some others that I did not mention.

408
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:28,310
Um, so lots of gut peptides got hormones that inhibit appetite and only one that's well characterized that actually stimulates appetite.

409
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:39,140
So interesting area of human physiology that is still emerging, still learning about this stuff.

410
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:51,979
This I'm ending a little early today so that parents had told me they had to leave to go to Zingerman's after class today.

411
00:58:51,980 --> 00:59:15,590
So we're ending a little bit. So I thought you said August 6th.

412
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:22,190
Absolutely not my job.

413
00:59:22,940 --> 00:59:29,120
And that's a good thing. I know. I know.

414
00:59:29,810 --> 00:59:33,170
They were many.

415
00:59:35,330 --> 00:59:38,760
Well, you're that I say.

416
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:43,220
That's all I want to know. I remember there was like that.

417
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:53,370
So how do you feel like as well?

418
00:59:53,960 --> 01:00:23,530
So I was like, okay, I know that like living in 10th grade, I only got one drop and I'm really good.

419
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:31,760
Great deal of confidence in the future.

420
01:00:35,820 --> 01:00:48,600
What I like exactly what I feel is by no means yeah.

421
01:00:49,490 --> 01:01:00,530
Okay. Because I mean, I like, I like being able to share that with guys that are doing, you know, not even in the slide,

422
01:01:00,530 --> 01:01:12,540
etc. from this because there are some really good videos from a lot because that's what I, you know, I, I like, I like that.

423
01:01:12,620 --> 01:01:24,110
But it's more just like I think art is representative and not I'm sure you'll see it.

424
01:01:24,470 --> 01:01:28,390
Right, right. Yeah.

425
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:42,830
Okay. Okay, guys getting I think this is a little bit different because you can just speak about it or have like,

426
01:01:45,230 --> 01:01:56,750
okay, this is a really people and it's like, yeah,

427
01:01:56,750 --> 01:02:04,430
I remember doing that because I was better and I'm like, I don't know what's the one thing,

428
01:02:04,430 --> 01:02:09,550
but hearing like that people have that was know how it was like I don't know.

429
01:02:09,590 --> 01:02:19,970
So how did you guys in the video work?

430
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:28,920
You know, all the way by one of them was controversial but somebody in there and her like she's like Harvard.

431
01:02:29,180 --> 01:02:37,260
Yeah, I remember her name and I remember her saying, like, yeah, controversial right now.

432
01:02:38,380 --> 01:02:42,350
I think that I think really without being introduced people, right?

433
01:02:43,220 --> 01:02:48,140
Yeah. You just have no other knowledge like because they have so many other.

434
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:56,179
Yeah, it was like this was like this was one of like of professors, but this was the one that was I don't even think I would never have done that.

435
01:02:56,180 --> 01:03:00,730
You know, they wouldn't even. Just watch this one. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

436
01:03:01,090 --> 01:03:06,650
It's tricky. So we're going to address that. I think that's going to be one that we're not.

437
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:14,120
Yeah. Which, as they say, is extremist.

438
01:03:14,660 --> 01:03:20,840
But I think some of the stuff I always liked is dumping syndrome and then they will get scared as well.

439
01:03:22,660 --> 01:03:25,990
This is not good, but.

440
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:31,310
We're fed into what you just said.

441
01:03:31,850 --> 01:03:37,770
The file reflects and comes up or is for kids.

442
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:41,120
So if you eat too much in your stomach volume, it's shrunk.

443
01:03:43,430 --> 01:03:50,510
It has a tendency to get into the esophagus for just one or 2 hours after the weight is supposed to go down.

444
01:03:50,520 --> 01:04:02,120
So, in fact, the file reflects, well, if you would have normal peristalsis pushing things down, but you don't force up.

445
01:04:02,130 --> 01:04:11,300
Yeah. So there's two things, there's the overloading that can that the lower esophageal sphincter doesn't close completely.

446
01:04:12,170 --> 01:04:19,190
And the other thing is there could be an issue with dumping centers that don't mix.

447
01:04:19,190 --> 01:04:26,130
And there has more to do with what's in the food credit as much as it hurts because you have all this.

448
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:33,610
Mean we just can't we can you could you could how how we really going down so

449
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:40,280
fast people do it how do you stretch it out something to regain the stomach.

450
01:04:40,430 --> 01:04:45,050
And it is possible, which is what we don't know.

451
01:04:45,530 --> 01:04:54,889
One thing I don't know exactly how that happens, but it's funny this semester when you think about regaining insulin resistance sensitivity,

452
01:04:54,890 --> 01:04:58,190
we use Eversense in today's hearing without symptoms.

453
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:09,190
Oh, I'm so confused on this type of religious knockout thing to understand that I the GAAP, I just normally do that.

454
01:05:09,690 --> 01:05:18,830
You just got insulin secretion and promote nutrient storage with you to have a high fat diet.

455
01:05:19,490 --> 01:05:23,760
Yeah, well it's because you're saying if they don't have good he is not detected,

456
01:05:23,870 --> 01:05:32,420
they wouldn't have insulin secretion and there seems like the appetite aspect take a be saying yeah I don't know

457
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:39,650
just just what's observed it's what's observed and I don't know what mechanism has been delineated for that or not.

458
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:46,390
Okay. I have to go back and try to have other hormone effects that are parts of that are the appetite more or something.

459
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:52,620
So, so this, this exploration of hormones opens up a lot of doors, right?

460
01:05:52,780 --> 01:05:58,849
And you don't they're like wormholes once you go down the idea that there's lots and lots of information and I don't want

461
01:05:58,850 --> 01:06:06,079
people to not know exactly because once you go down that you find that things are confusing and they don't quite make sense.

462
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:10,350
So that makes sense this more. I think about it for this statement of what they found.

463
01:06:10,350 --> 01:06:13,670
Yeah. So I mean I, it's the use of the initial version.

464
01:06:16,370 --> 01:06:19,790
Well that's why we know the formulations, right.

465
01:06:20,710 --> 01:06:33,260
Yeah. Yeah. Well I talked to Carol about them and it's seen you doing that's what he and because I'm not near

466
01:06:33,260 --> 01:06:39,290
where people are taking an exam somebody has a question they have to find such a great time less.

467
01:06:39,770 --> 01:06:43,820
I have everybody look at somebody they might get me.

468
01:06:44,510 --> 01:06:51,140
I'm going to talk to them. How do we do this? You done this in other classes and what works?

469
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:57,360
Usually we have one or two or three people who have this.

470
01:06:57,830 --> 01:07:02,030
This year we have seven people. Okay, so I'll just wait for an announcement.

471
01:07:02,030 --> 01:07:06,220
Yeah, that's right.

472
01:07:06,540 --> 01:07:12,860
Well, since I could talk to a student and I can ask him why, you know.

473
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:17,290
Sure, sure. Okay. That's my case.

474
01:07:18,420 --> 01:07:25,360
All of it. Yeah, we have so many of them know we don't object specificity, make sure.

475
01:07:25,510 --> 01:07:35,510
And so when it came to terms of this, we don't quite understand what his head was zegras and some of whom actually.

476
01:07:35,510 --> 01:07:45,340
Okay, so when you have this different counting center, this is not the receptor do one.

477
01:07:45,610 --> 01:07:46,200
Yeah. Okay.

478
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:56,720
So you can make you have two appeals right there in the topic if you only have one illegal, it's kind of like you have a partial left to do so.

479
01:07:57,260 --> 01:08:02,300
See how like. Yeah, and that's a heterozygous heterozygous.

480
01:08:02,420 --> 01:08:05,590
Yes. That is recessive for different types of.

481
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:14,420
Yes. But also to when you have cervical disturbance so you would hate you would have less sense,

482
01:08:14,510 --> 01:08:26,960
less sensitivity to that because there's oh oh yeah right to fix this partial on the treatment.

483
01:08:27,080 --> 01:08:29,390
We didn't talk about it like this, too.

484
01:08:30,540 --> 01:08:39,359
So if you do get the treatment so you can get people to leptin as well because they still have some they're still well,

485
01:08:39,360 --> 01:08:47,730
they're going to have this receptors are fine. They're just not making a functional as much functional leptin or they're making not.

486
01:08:48,420 --> 01:08:54,090
So if you have yeah. If you have if you're heterozygous, you still have a gene that can produce just not as much.

487
01:08:54,690 --> 01:09:01,320
So we just check for the level and then we take we check if there's a disproportional.

488
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:04,560
Yes. And then we can give you.

489
01:09:05,330 --> 01:09:10,170
Yeah. More functional. Yes, exactly.

490
01:09:10,750 --> 01:09:17,280
Yeah. Let's just move it. Okay.

491
01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:26,210
So in other therapies this week, you still modify leptin, so your stay in the body is called is called Metro Leptin.

492
01:09:26,220 --> 01:09:33,330
Yes. And that applies to this, too. Yes. But I can write to invite you the question.

493
01:09:33,330 --> 01:09:37,020
Yeah, I have one more prepared for our next meeting.

494
01:09:37,050 --> 01:09:40,770
Okay. Yes. Do I have a behind you?

495
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:48,840
All right. So the rest of you have gone to Zingerman's last week.

496
01:09:49,230 --> 01:09:53,460
We thank you for your time.

497
01:09:53,700 --> 01:10:03,750
We can't wait to see you on the outside.

498
01:10:06,150 --> 01:10:19,740
Amazing things you guys have discovered. I keep pushing on the Christmas list.

499
01:10:20,550 --> 01:10:28,320
Well, first question about what's affecting obesity, as always, first 101,000 days.

500
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:32,310
Why wouldn't that make it? Tweet, tweet, question.

501
01:10:34,530 --> 01:10:38,760
The answer is the beginning of the gestation.

502
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:42,540
Oh, early justice. So which was most?

503
01:10:42,540 --> 01:10:52,199
Which is most. And that was just from the evidence from like the hunger chart or study or because the most effects occurred when fast,

504
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:58,080
when the early fasting during the later mother had that early gestation.

505
01:10:58,380 --> 01:11:05,130
So in about the 1000 days because this is the most susceptible during was as well the

506
01:11:05,130 --> 01:11:10,260
most the first 1000 days is like a brown it doesn't like on my most impactful reasons

507
01:11:10,260 --> 01:11:16,169
I was diagnosed because physically you're seeing that all vulnerable gestation is

508
01:11:16,170 --> 01:11:23,490
also in the 1000 days but within a 1000 things that early gestation it seems like.

509
01:11:25,300 --> 01:11:32,300
Yeah. Thank you so much. I had to take a look at that.

510
01:11:32,780 --> 01:11:39,360
It's a process of the Chase project, so it's a long email idea.

511
01:11:39,670 --> 01:11:43,409
You know, I told you, you change too.

512
01:11:43,410 --> 01:11:48,960
I thought it prior to that I had just write. You said it. I didn't get in my phone until recently.

513
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:56,190
Yeah, not recently. Last year in the winter when I went home for Christmas, I got it.

514
01:11:56,730 --> 01:11:59,950
Bad seal. Oh, you.

515
01:12:00,150 --> 01:12:01,460
You upgrading yourself?

516
01:12:02,490 --> 01:12:17,670
No, I just the thing about my old phone is that 5G, whatever it was that was moved from what is saying that it's in your pocket.

517
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:31,050
Yeah, I guess that changes because right now you're not allowed to sit for too long.

518
01:12:32,290 --> 01:12:35,130
I think I used to like that. I like become better about it.

519
01:12:35,730 --> 01:12:49,080
My mom was so mad if I grew up with like my 21st birthday that we have to buy special boxes of just random things.

520
01:12:49,180 --> 01:13:05,650
Yeah. Okay, so maybe you go over it and we will talk about science, but this is your place.

521
01:13:06,100 --> 01:13:13,880
You can do assessment or just basically, I just need you to assess my body and I'm using.

522
01:13:14,460 --> 01:13:18,600
See what I can do. Maybe this is my office.

523
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:26,280
If you want to. I have a chance to do that.

524
01:13:26,820 --> 01:13:30,530
And she'll be like, Yeah, so you have to pull, we have to jam.

525
01:13:31,110 --> 01:13:35,100
And I've never been so good that people want.

526
01:13:35,480 --> 01:13:41,710
I know who I am. Yes, I know it's what I do.

527
01:13:41,820 --> 01:13:45,600
I mean, for a few weeks, I heard about my mother.

528
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:55,409
Now it's like officially like you're booked right behind. It's happened in the past is zero zero.

529
01:13:55,410 --> 01:14:01,230
And then, you know, later it's two or two from survivors.

530
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:05,400
Yeah. You're like, oh, you could.

531
01:14:05,670 --> 01:14:10,270
You could do it. You're nonstop from parapsychology. Jerry Quiz.

532
01:14:10,350 --> 01:14:14,009
Now looking back, it feels like a big price difference between that and for that.

533
01:14:14,010 --> 01:14:20,700
How much do you think I'll have to play my role? What I wanted to hear, I was looking at the Bellagio massacre.

534
01:14:21,510 --> 01:14:29,060
It's like it's like just choo choo and then po po po po po.

535
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:42,870
But it's just so fast and easy within that. But still, you see, if you do, you get, like a handshake because you're like, really?

536
01:14:42,870 --> 01:14:47,490
Actually, I feel positive. It's never been like, Oh, yeah, I see.

537
01:14:47,940 --> 01:14:53,320
I told you to realize the power of the game or something like that.

538
01:14:53,610 --> 01:15:00,749
What if I told you I was like I told you what happened anyway because of the future?

539
01:15:00,750 --> 01:15:04,050
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, if you have your stuff, that's all.

540
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:13,169
Just. Just for us to assessment and we use a gym and I would remind myself and then it hit me all live here.

541
01:15:13,170 --> 01:15:16,360
No. Okay. Okay.

542
01:15:16,410 --> 01:15:19,410
Yeah. Just sent me email. I think there's one for you too.

543
01:15:20,010 --> 01:15:31,319
I like I would get there. From what happens when you get there, why don't you like is going with your friends over these past few years you remember.

544
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:34,590
Oh I do. In a week.

545
01:15:35,190 --> 01:15:38,500
Yeah, I was there, but I don't do work here. I'm going to assess for you.

546
01:15:38,670 --> 01:15:47,240
It's essentially Delta, right? It's just the only thing is I would have some of title since you know.

547
01:15:47,570 --> 01:15:51,960
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm such.

548
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:54,960
Okay, I see. Yeah. Because there has to be a role.

549
01:15:56,680 --> 01:16:08,059
I'm sorry, but I don't have a gym membership to I don't just think it really is more fun yet because that all kind of people come over.

550
01:16:08,060 --> 01:16:13,460
We have a raffle thing with a party about a place to.

551
01:16:15,060 --> 01:16:22,990
And presumably from this we can see you're just looking at like 303 Thanksgiving weekend.

552
01:16:23,380 --> 01:16:44,420
I have a phrase that we can. Like the thousands of US troops who come to these wars.

553
01:16:46,720 --> 01:16:50,130
I hope to included together. Yeah.

554
01:16:50,150 --> 01:16:57,520
So I'll let you guys just do that because it's like an apartment, right?

555
01:16:59,030 --> 01:17:05,150
It's a mineral.

556
01:17:11,080 --> 01:17:19,330
We went to the cookie making last week where I went to FedEx after I gave them.

557
01:17:20,660 --> 01:17:25,129
Oh, long cookies. Only the good ones, the general ones.

558
01:17:25,130 --> 01:17:33,380
And the gluten free was not good enough for them to back the cookies.

559
01:17:33,710 --> 01:17:40,100
And I said, thank you for making posters for us. Oh, I want to have those.

560
01:17:41,060 --> 01:17:46,840
I didn't want to give away. And I was thinking that co alike is going to show appreciation at you.

561
01:17:48,630 --> 01:17:51,770
I don't either. That's how I thought.

562
01:17:52,040 --> 01:17:56,740
Okay. All right.

563
01:17:56,750 --> 01:18:00,070
Before. But as just I'm trying to overcome isn't.

564
01:18:01,370 --> 01:18:10,980
Yes, this is true. I noticed something that I couldn't I could not finish so good.

565
01:18:11,820 --> 01:18:20,430
But this morning I was thinking maybe I'll have eye bags, because usually that was the shoe, which was more fluid.

566
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:24,120
At least this one. I didn't have the bags. I was thinking.

567
01:18:24,120 --> 01:18:29,610
So the history is last task is they just like that.

568
01:18:31,400 --> 01:18:44,050
Why all the seats just have a little bit. I might as well be forced to do it with the things that go with you.

569
01:18:47,610 --> 01:18:56,790
I'm just like, you don't have to go through the scandals to know that it was such a lot, which is a lot.

570
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:01,260
But I feel like if they're just moving 1500.

571
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:07,850
If we do a Saturday, then you have like some. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

572
01:19:09,570 --> 01:19:22,400
Are you flying back in and. I don't know what to tell to find someone that's either at 1030 or this is either of us to be nice cleaning at home.

573
01:19:26,030 --> 01:19:29,329
Ultimate goal around 10:30 a.m. and you get home at like 130.

574
01:19:29,330 --> 01:19:34,400
So they're both like, yes, they're just pretty gross. Yeah, I and I'm not.

575
01:19:36,300 --> 01:19:54,930
I don't. It.
