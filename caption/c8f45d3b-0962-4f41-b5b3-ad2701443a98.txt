1
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:11,730
In this module, we're going to be talking about imposter syndrome and I can group imposter syndrome and perfectionism under kind of mind tricks,

2
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:15,990
mind games that a lot of us deal with in high achievement settings.

3
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:24,200
But I'm going to differentiate a little bit between them and we're going to talk about how to work through them.

4
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:30,900
So kind of a definition for impostor syndrome Is this kind of nagging and chronic

5
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:43,220
doubting of your ability, doubting that you belong in the positions that you get or that you deserve the accomplishments that you have.

6
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:49,520
And so there's this kind of nagging feeling of like if people really knew me, if they really saw it, would see that I don't belong here

7
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,980
that I'm kind of like a fraud. And this often leads us to minimize our strengths.

8
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:59,270
So a lot of times we achieve something and we have a success. We think, oh, it's by luck.

9
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:04,430
Its by luck I got into this university. It's by luck that I got into this program.

10
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:14,360
And there's a thing and this fear of kind of being found out for for who we really are. And what we know about imposter syndrome

11
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:18,340
Is that lots of people who are high achieving deal with it.

12
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:25,170
It's higher actually in those group. And this is something we really think about because

13
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:30,150
It kind of gives you a clue that it's it's not accurate.

14
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:43,200
If people who aren't worried about being in these really competitive spaces aren't experiencing imposter syndrome as much.

15
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,590
And then the people who work really hard to get there are really worried.

16
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:56,160
Its almost like the smarter that you are, the more that you work your way up the corporate ladder or the academic ladder, the more people worry about

17
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:04,800
Am I good enough? Am I smart enough? Do I believe to be here? So its kind of a sad thing when some of the most accomplished and poorest people are

18
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:10,570
the most worried about whether or not they really are smart or good enough.

19
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:19,680
So we know that it's not an accurate measure of how capable people are because really capable people are all wondering about themselves.

20
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,450
The other thing is that we know that it's experienced more by marginalized people.

21
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:31,310
And part of why this is, is because when we enter into an environment where we know that

22
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:36,960
there's bias. We know that people don't necessarily because of stereotypes

23
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:44,760
expect us to be less successful or capable in those settings, it can lead us to start second guessing ourselves and appearing proving people wrong.

24
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:50,100
And often we're not seeing a lot of people that look like us in those settings. It also makes us feel like,

25
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,560
Do I belong here?

26
00:02:52,560 --> 00:03:02,160
Or I would hate to prove after they let me in here that I'm not what and lot of these fears are really a unfair that people even have to experience them

27
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:06,030
they're also usually not really founded.

28
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:18,160
So women are more likely to experience imposter syndrome than men and particularly the men in STEM or male dominated

29
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:23,980
fields, also people of color and other marginalized identities are more likely to question

30
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:29,080
themselves because there's a long history of stereotypes about them not being as capable,

31
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:33,670
even though we know that often when they are in those positions

32
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:42,370
you really thrive and bring a lot new. So I like to think of imposter syndrome less as something that's an individual being with us.

33
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:48,520
That's that's just kind of like, oh we're just self doubters.

34
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:59,480
But more that it's a symptom of being in an environment that hasn't really trained you to see your gifts and believe in them.

35
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:10,520
Often when people are in settings that are really built to believe in their strengths and point them out to them, just assume that they are competent.

36
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:14,930
We start to see imposter syndrome go down. So we want to think about a lot

37
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:20,150
What is the environment like? What are the messages that I'm receiving about myself?

38
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:28,190
And know that those can lead us to doubt ourselves in ways that don't help us and aren't really based on our real abilities,

39
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:32,030
stereotype threat is another concept that's kind of related to imposter syndrome.

40
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:37,310
People started studying this before imposter syndrome was really known as a thing and stereotype threat

41
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:47,700
simply means that we know there's a negative stereotype about us in environment, even if we're not even thinking about that in the moment.

42
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:52,660
It can lead us to perform not as well at whatever the task is.

43
00:04:52,660 --> 00:05:02,610
And part of why this is because once our brain, whether we're thinking about it or not, knows that there's this negative stereotype out there.

44
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:10,200
It starts using that information in ways that don't help interrupts our working memory, which is a part of our brain that holds data

45
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:15,590
thinks about it moves it around. So it's almost like there's a panic that's happening.

46
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:20,560
There's a distraction about the stereotype that's interfering with the performance.

47
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,590
And so we want to address these things. They're normal that they occur.

48
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:31,930
It's actually, again, a symptom of kind of an unhealthiness in the environment.

49
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:40,920
But we want to figure out how to work with them as best as possible so that they don't interfere with your performance.

50
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:48,900
And this is we talk about this, you'll see this slide again in this section about building capacity for doing big and difficult things.

51
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:53,850
But the one thing I just want to point out in this moment is this section of the box seats.

52
00:05:53,850 --> 00:06:03,540
When we get Brene Brown's into the arena, when we get where the spotlight is on us and we have to perform and we're having our big moments,

53
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:08,220
we're often really aware of what she calls the box seats.

54
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:14,850
All of the societal norms about how people should talk, how they should look, who deserve to be here.

55
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:19,050
We know that those things exist and sometimes it affects our performance

56
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:29,410
So we'll come back to this metaphor later and talk more about how to think about it and navigate it.

57
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:36,350
But this is part of why we see the impostor syndrome this is part of.

58
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:44,550
So I want to read you some quotes, because I want you to know that if you are experiencing impostor syndrome, you're in good company.

59
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:51,780
So another quote from Maya Angelou, "Each time I write a book, every time I face that yellow pad, the challenge is so great,

60
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:56,040
I've written eleven books but each time I think 'Uh oh, they're going to find out now.

61
00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:07,160
I've run a game on everybody and they're going to find me out". So this is somebody who is a prolific writer.

62
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:15,800
One of the greatest of our time, who's given read her poetry at an inauguration, who's done so many different things.

63
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:20,510
And it says every time she sits down to write, there's still that fear there.

64
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:26,190
So part of what that lets us know is that fear doesn't have to stop us from doing great.

65
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:34,640
So many other people, if you Google this you'll find tons of people but who've talked publicly about dealing with imposter syndrome and food.

66
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:38,830
Lisa Ray, Natalie Portman, Violet Davis, Penelope Cruz,

67
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:43,360
Tina Fey, Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor.

68
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:51,580
So just know, it actually doesn't mean anything negative about you, you're really in good company or what we do with it once

69
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:57,590
It shows up. Michelle Obama said

70
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:03,980
"I don't know if the world should take me seriously; I'm the best" and she's talking as a child thinking,

71
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:08,810
" I'm just Michelle Robinson, that little girl on the south side who went to public school."

72
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:19,190
So you hear that awareness of how the world sees her and what we think people like

73
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:27,820
She goes on to say in this next quote" The question I ask myself 'am I good enough?'

74
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:38,240
That haunts us, because the messages that are sent from the time we are little is: Maybe you are not.

75
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,610
We're not going to. Don't reach too high. Don't talk too loud."

76
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:49,360
So, again, all of these kind of rules of where we're allowed to be how we're allowed to be when we're there

77
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:56,630
that can make a start second guessing ourselves. And then this one is my favorite.

78
00:08:56,630 --> 00:09:02,610
She says, I've been at probably every powerful table that you can think of and she lists them off.

79
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:10,860
And she says they're not that smart, so this is one of the things and we'll talk a little bit more about comparison.

80
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:15,420
We often are in the room with other smart students, other smart professionals,

81
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:23,360
and we start seeing their what they're presenting, the togetherness that they're presenting.

82
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:31,400
And we start comparing our behind the scenes kind of like consider like our mess start comparing it to their magic.

83
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:38,870
And it's not a fair comparison. Half the time the other people have completely different journeys, completely different strengths and weaknesses.

84
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:48,260
Some people are going to be great speakers. Some people are going to be great analyzer. Some people are going to be great at writing, you know.

85
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:52,290
And so it's not so much where you have to be like everybody else

86
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:58,520
or the fact everybody else looks together. You can hear your own internal dialog.

87
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:04,400
I tend to think everybody has different types of smartness and different types of weakness.

88
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:11,890
And we can often get psyched out cause we're just seeing everybody else's exterior and thinking that we're not good enough.

89
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:18,740
But I tend to trust that Michelle Obama's been in all of these different rooms, she's seen that some of the people were most impressed by

90
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:27,150
are ordinary people who just sat in the room, showed up and did the thing that they qualified to do.

91
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:34,810
And that's all we have to do. This is a great quote, another one by Audrey Lorde.

92
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:43,950
"If I did not define myself for myself, I would be crushed into other people's fantasies of me and eaten alive."

93
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:55,260
And so when you think back at that exercise at the end of the section perfectionism, that idea of knowing how other people perceive you,

94
00:10:55,260 --> 00:11:03,620
still being really clear about who you are, what your values are where you want to go and that you are more than

95
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:08,870
just how other people perceive you. That's really key, self definition

96
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:18,130
and not letting it be, it's going to get influenced by other people, but not letting it completely crumble and let other people tell you

97
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:24,970
who you are and what you're capable of. So here are some of the keys to dealing with imposter syndrome.

98
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:34,540
If we know that it's at least partially or a lot of it is about the environments that we're in. We want to have social support

99
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:39,670
we want the people that are closest to us are squad to believe in us,

100
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:47,200
to be honest with us about the areas that we need to grow, but really talk to us in a way that's not shaming.

101
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,820
And that helps us say to identify what do we need to do next? How do we need to grow?

102
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:59,500
Sometimes being in professional groups that are geared to your different identities,

103
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:10,050
so your ethnic group, your religious group, your gender identity or sexual orientation group.

104
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:17,470
Being in those groups women in STEM, Black students in engineering, those types of groups sometimes

105
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:22,490
let us just breathe and know that we belong and be around other amazing people and be affirmed.

106
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:30,320
And that can be really useful, so we want to have the people around us.

107
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:36,420
We want to have safe places where we can even talk about imposter syndrome and know that we're not alone in it.

108
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:43,550
There's a quote that says, and I think this comes from Brene Browns work, but I'm not sure if that. But that

109
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:50,100
theme once is told, and we tell our stories in safe places, shame goes down because we realize everybody has it.

110
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,940
Everybody's dealing with it.

111
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:59,780
We want to know our strengths, and so we have multiple exercises that we've talked about so that we get really clear on that.

112
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:07,120
We want to avoid comparison because the comparisons usually aren't fair, they usually aren't accurate.

113
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,950
And we don't want to believe everything our mind tells us.

114
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:15,110
So there's going to be times where we're thinking I'm not good enough or this mistake is too big.

115
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:22,550
And often we have to go back to our self compassion and back to coaching, talk with a friend who can help us reframe it.

116
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:27,520
Just because I think I can't do it doesn't mean it's actually true.

117
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:31,660
Then often we have to move with fear and the doubt. Half the time,

118
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:38,110
the reason why we even worry about whether we belong or whether we're good enough just because whatever we're doing really matters to us.

119
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:45,720
And so sometimes we have to tell ourselves, you know what my anxiety is just letting me know that this is important to me, that it matters.

120
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:53,270
Have some self doubt, have some fear. I'm going to move with it anyway, because I do belong here.

121
00:13:53,270 --> 00:14:00,320
Because I do have strengths. So these are the things you want to go back to.

122
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,030
And then we want to bolster these are like people around us

123
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:12,560
And these practices so that we can move through.
