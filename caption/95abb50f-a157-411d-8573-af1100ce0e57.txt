1
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:14,040
So today I think everyone turned in their first step.

2
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:19,440
Were there any issues with that or any follow up questions or.

3
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,520
I think I saw 24 times.

4
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:39,150
Okay. So today we have a short lecture on sound effects and contemporaneity and then we'll have time for you to work on those problems.

5
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:47,490
That and second one to Thursday or if you want to work on the just the practice problem.

6
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:57,360
And overall, we're kind of halfway through this third section in the quantitative section.

7
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:07,469
So it's not linkage analysis. And you just quickly and and then we'll talk about that.

8
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:20,400
We see the testing has become so complex that we covered this first five weeks minutes.

9
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:26,100
It is so today.

10
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:38,690
Well, in fact, it's going to be so those two phenomenons phenomena have to do with how rare it is.

11
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:53,790
Can you do this one work? So I have no comment but can have an increase in appearance and we would see an increase in recessive disorders.

12
00:01:53,790 --> 00:02:05,730
So procedures that you expect to be better than rare, you would see a sort of a high increase in those two, those recessive diseases.

13
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:15,900
So we'll talk about these two phenomenon. So side effect is more about relation to this kind of effect in kinds.

14
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:20,280
Meetings might be in fact.

15
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:28,260
So how many of you are familiar with following effect means?

16
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:36,620
I've heard that plus it's seems. What about forcing me to leave?

17
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,790
You know what it would have been.

18
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:54,180
Yeah. Okay, so we'll talk about those will define the founder effect and how that affects the prevalence of supporters.

19
00:02:55,910 --> 00:03:02,900
Describe how did that affect those and calculate the probabilities of inheriting

20
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:08,180
and any of that is coming from a coffee ancestor or identical my sons.

21
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:22,970
And then define and calculate it really. So founder fact is sort of the outcome that you would have from the establishment of a new population.

22
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:34,430
So you have a new population that is established from a few founders or a few members that kind of for some reason become isolated either

23
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:48,470
geographically or you have a certain migration trend where you have few and few ancestors or a few individuals that would create a new population.

24
00:03:49,040 --> 00:04:00,079
And so the descendants of those founders or early ancestors would have whatever allegiance those ancestors have,

25
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:08,600
and you would end up sort of just reduced genetic diversity in the population and then recessive

26
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:16,280
areas that were that you would typically not see as often would become more more visible.

27
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:25,600
And the descendants. So typically when we talk about founder effect,

28
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:32,349
we think we think about about ten generations between that the having the founders

29
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:37,390
or the early ancestors and children beginning to show those recessive disorders.

30
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:46,479
And so it's something to kind of keep in mind when we talk about founded funder effect, we're not really talking about inbreeding.

31
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:56,709
So we're thinking about those populations as willing to breed or make mates from populations from outside of the the limited population.

32
00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:09,250
But just just because of how they have to to or reduced and reduced the genetic diversity coming from the term the founders or the early ancestors.

33
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:15,640
You end up with children with recessive disease in about ten generations or so.

34
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:26,200
And then and so we we know of a we'll talk about some and founder effects that we know of.

35
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:35,739
So like the Finnish disease heritage these are a disorder of disorders of about 35 genetic diseases.

36
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:43,870
So a group of 25 genetic disorders that are not just not limited to finished but just

37
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:49,390
more common in individuals of Finnish ancestry offending Finnish and Swedish ancestry.

38
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:56,770
And this saga, in fact, was took about 100 generations to kind of get established.

39
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,459
And now the population is about 5 million people.

40
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:13,090
But we see that they have higher prevalence or more of those recessive values, of those recessive disorders.

41
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:21,780
How did they like figure out that it was happening 100 generations ago like that, the mutations.

42
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:28,669
So probably just by checking pedigrees and so those populations are interesting

43
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:34,540
is that because we didn't get into that more entering the general population,

44
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:39,040
it's sort of easier to track because they have a higher prevalence then it's not like

45
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:47,199
you have one person having the the but it's more common in just by checking ancestry

46
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:52,479
and developing pedigrees like the next slide shows like a pedigree that you could

47
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:59,400
establish this is like more exposure and so you're able to kind of track those,

48
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:03,160
those recessive that we use that are not typically as common.

49
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:16,150
So this is another example of a founder of fact, Nova Scotia, that that population was forming in 1767.

50
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:24,330
And this pedigree shows the Niemann-Pick type D disease, which is almost exclusive to this population.

51
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:35,320
It is a rare autism with recessive neurodegenerative disorder where you have a mutation that affect the transport of the cells.

52
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:41,680
And it can, I think, most different types of it.

53
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,100
But most affected individuals do not live.

54
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:50,170
Very few lived to adulthood, so they're not really reproducing.

55
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:53,860
But you still have those recessive variants kind of showing in the population.

56
00:07:53,860 --> 00:08:01,629
Yeah. Are these like mutations that occur just randomly throughout time in these populations and say there because they're

57
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:08,830
isolated or is this like a recessive trait that the founders had and then it just didn't manifest until later?

58
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:13,750
And if that's the case, then wouldn't there always be like if you had the heterozygous would either

59
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:18,340
always be a 25% chance they would have it and then it would manifest earlier,

60
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:25,000
like why does it take so long? So I guess it's there's many questions within your question.

61
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:31,239
So it could be either I guess it's it could be a mutation that kind of started.

62
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:39,129
But then you have this like maybe this person when we talk about founder effect, we talk about the the rare,

63
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:43,600
the rare at least kind of being transmitted in as sort of an isolated population.

64
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:52,780
So as long as you have sort of this isolated population kind of concept and you have maybe a mutation in an early ancestor,

65
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:57,580
it can just keep getting carried over down to the descendants.

66
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:07,299
And then and then showing you would by chance end up mating with someone that kind of has the same little from a common ancestor.

67
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:12,640
And then the disease kind of would would show or the recessive would show.

68
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:18,460
So I guess it's kind of a function of how likely you are to meet someone that.

69
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:27,270
Also carries this same recessive LDL, and I know it's like 25%, but just because of like how so those people are,

70
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:35,790
as you see, like we have individuals coming from the outside so our feeding but it's kind of not enough to.

71
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:48,070
Prevents like some meeting from eventually like a common ancestor or segment that is coming from a common ancestor.

72
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:53,500
Is it so easy when from the outside population those people likely don't have that well?

73
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:57,790
So then. Okay. Yeah. So it takes time. It's like kind of getting diluted.

74
00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:05,800
But also eventually, like, you would end up meeting with someone who is kind of an old or old common ancestor.

75
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:09,370
Okay, that makes sense. Thank you. Any more questions?

76
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:22,700
So. Okay. So I think there's another example from this region in the north eastern Quebec,

77
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:34,580
where also a population that was established years ago and you have 600 founding members,

78
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:48,049
then 12 generations later, we saw that we see those effects of recessive disorders now the population size about 300 and and those individuals.

79
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:52,950
So the carriers are 5 to 40.

80
00:10:52,960 --> 00:11:01,070
The the frequencies of carriers are heterozygous are 5 to 40 times larger than most population.

81
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:05,840
So, again, it's not like you wouldn't observe them in the general population,

82
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:13,400
but the frequencies or the how much carriers you have is so much more in those populations.

83
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:20,660
And this is just the list of disorders that are coming from that region.

84
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:35,330
And they span different kind of they affect different body systems from kidney, from lysosomal storage disorders gain sensory loss.

85
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:38,630
And this is the frequency of heterozygous.

86
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:49,910
And you can see that about 1 to 5% of the population of the individuals in the population population are carriers.

87
00:11:52,240 --> 00:12:03,360
Any questions about that? How did like how did the original founding members like especially like these diseases that

88
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:09,570
are occurring in like in the Americas and the like reasonably came over like what is in the.

89
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:16,680
Like is it the environment that like influence like all of their genes to like change to have the genes to pass down.

90
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:23,230
You're not one of the ancestors or yeah. Like why they have that mutation to begin with.

91
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:27,010
I guess it's by, by random. You can have a certain mutation,

92
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:36,399
but in a typical probably in like maybe think about randomly meeting population that's like

93
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:48,280
large enough those areas with kind of get diluted or kind of not get fixated and yeah,

94
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:53,259
so the they would kind of kind of drift away or something.

95
00:12:53,260 --> 00:13:03,579
So but just because of how these populations become established and they're isolated and we have a limited number of few ancestors,

96
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:09,880
then those recessive disorders just become more apparent or higher,

97
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:15,490
higher prevalence than what you would expect from a randomly meeting population large enough.

98
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,640
Any more questions? Okay.

99
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:31,280
So so we'll shift gears a bit now and talk about containment and speeding,

100
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:43,220
which is sort of another way by which you would have recessive LDL or recessive LDL, leading to recessive disorders that you do not commonly seen.

101
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:49,370
You see those increase in prevalence and as you're more likely to observe them.

102
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:55,880
So content in this meeting is meeting between individuals who are genetically related.

103
00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:06,790
And the degree of inbreeding is based on the probability that the individual inherent to Ali is that they are coming from a common ancestor.

104
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:12,280
And here we're talking about, if you want to kind of compare it to the founder effect,

105
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:19,359
which is more of a population based kind of phenomenon or concept here we're talking

106
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:26,230
more on based on families or more like of limited pedigree and viewpoint point.

107
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:39,100
So whenever we have identical by the extent this is when we have an LDL that is likely to come from a common ancestor.

108
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:45,620
So the individual would have to both likely come from the same ancestors.

109
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:56,889
And then so we we like to think about consent when it's meeting, when we're talking, for example,

110
00:14:56,890 --> 00:15:03,820
in a setting of a genetic counseling where you would have two individuals coming in and looking

111
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:12,580
at what's their likelihood of having a child with a certain disorder or even a certain disorder.

112
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:24,070
And we typically think of four generations is when you would have that inbreeding effect become negligible.

113
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:31,330
So that's kind of a third cousin marriage. And we'll we'll see how the probabilities of inheriting illegals they're coming from a

114
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:38,470
common ancestor would be so much smaller when we are talking about third cousin marriage.

115
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:45,840
So the third cousin marriage is when you have common ancestors who are great, great grandparents.

116
00:15:46,840 --> 00:16:00,399
And then at this level kind of of if you want relatedness the probability of inheriting to a Leo so to put like for a certain locus the two earliest

117
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:10,630
that you would have the probability that they come from an older common ancestor that you share with the person you're meeting with becomes 0.0039.

118
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,630
And this is called the inbreeding coefficient.

119
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:31,080
So we look at this kind of a pedigree and we see here two parents and those dashed line indicate a mating.

120
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:38,169
So we know that a parent and an offspring would share about half their DNA.

121
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:42,400
So because you would have you would receive half from the mom, half from the dads.

122
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:49,000
So then a parent and a child would have would be sharing half of the DNA.

123
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:57,370
And then so siblings also some linguists would share also half of the DNA just

124
00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:02,170
because of how you would receive half of the copies from each of your parents.

125
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:11,079
And then we would think of a sibling and sibling meeting for some reason, both siblings,

126
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:17,470
where to me then they would they would have an inbreeding coefficient of 0.25.

127
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:29,140
So so that would then into an individual whose parents were siblings would have a quarter of their DNA coming from the same ancestor.

128
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:43,860
Is that kind of clear? And then as you go down in the pedigree, then the probability of of or the inbreeding coefficient,

129
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:51,900
the probability of receiving an LBO that is the common ancestor decreases to a .039

130
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:57,000
and we'll have we'll show some calculations of how we kind of get to those numbers.

131
00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:03,750
Yeah. My question for this is like for the fifth cousin, is this in reference to the parent offspring?

132
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:12,140
Like what when we're looking at this like, you know, to keep reading each other like and then at that that cousin like,

133
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:19,140
is that in reference to the parent or in reference to the fourth cousin, meaning, you know, to the, to the original ancestors.

134
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:26,880
Yeah. And we'll, we'll, we'll try to track like an LPL and see how it moves, like through the pedigree.

135
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:32,110
So we're kind of referring to the common ancestor. Yeah.

136
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:42,720
It's like a train carrying over transmission probabilities from the early generation down to the two person in question.

137
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:48,120
How would you calculate? Like, say, like it was like the third cousin in the fifth cousin.

138
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:56,010
Like your cousin? Well, I feel like I'll be clear once we kind of do it here.

139
00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:03,270
So you would kind of. So you're saying, like, maybe at two levels like this first, then maybe with this person.

140
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:07,559
So you would kind of calculate the probabilities of transmission and multiply them.

141
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,240
We'll do it in the second. Yeah.

142
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:16,170
So when you call the ah wheels identical by descent, they wouldn't necessarily be exactly the same because of like recombination, right?

143
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,920
Well, not because of recombination. It's just a different concept.

144
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:28,830
So I think we call alleles that are exactly the same, identical by state.

145
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:32,580
So that's kind of another term identical by state.

146
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:39,060
And then IBD is more of just a concept of having a common ancestors.

147
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:43,230
Yeah. So for slightly different, slightly different concepts.

148
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:49,440
IBD they could not, they could be not the same, but just coming from a common ancestor think that.

149
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:55,600
The questions. Okay.

150
00:19:55,650 --> 00:20:02,750
So let's look over how we can kind of understand those probabilities of inheriting a specific IBD.

151
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:15,209
So you have a pedigree here. This person here, the male, this is a the A1, A to a Leo.

152
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:18,230
And then the female is entering the A3 three four.

153
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:25,709
And then we have their children. They have children and they're meeting.

154
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:32,010
And they have this yet not determined sex of a of a child.

155
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:41,960
So we're going to kind of follow the A1 a little and see how it is carried over from the common ancestor,

156
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:50,730
this person here, and how it can be carried over to to the great, great grandchild.

157
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:59,490
So for each step of the of the of the pedigree, we have a have a probability of transmission.

158
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:04,410
So each descendant would have a half probability of transmission.

159
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:10,889
So from this person here in generation one to this person here,

160
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:20,790
we have have and then being carried over to the the the other descendant is have then carried over to the person of interest is another half.

161
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:24,260
And then the other way by which the Leo can come,

162
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:36,150
kind of come because we're looking at common ancestor is through the daughter and then through her daughter and then to the person of interest.

163
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:42,510
So the transmission probabilities here are have to the power of six.

164
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:48,330
So we're multiplying all of those independent transmission probabilities from the.

165
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:55,780
Ancestor to the two. This person died here. And then I guess if you're looking at maybe.

166
00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:01,840
Maybe. I think that's like maybe an uncle and a niece or something.

167
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:08,560
So then you would probably multiply have buy more a house and have so.

168
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:15,590
So that would probably calculate a different level kind of a meeting, as you ask.

169
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:31,610
Is that clear? So this would be the probability of inheriting a specific Leo that is coming from a common ancestor.

170
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:38,320
And then expanding sort of on that is calculating the inbreeding coefficient.

171
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:44,370
So we know that. So if we are going to extend that to not just the A1 area,

172
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:52,520
so we're going to check the 8 to 8 three A4 and we know that those are mutually exclusive events.

173
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:59,550
So we can add the probability that we just calculated, we can add them three, all four wheels.

174
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:10,109
And that would give you .06 to five, which if you go back to this plot,

175
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:18,840
here is the inbreeding coefficient for first cousins that we have in the in this category here.

176
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:32,819
So this is the probability that the offspring of first cousin meeting are receiving a meals that are identical by the Senate.

177
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:41,090
Any locust because it's going to apply across the whole genome. And that would be point oh, 6 to 5 here.

178
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:54,050
Any questions? Okay.

179
00:23:54,800 --> 00:24:11,360
So we can see how this probability is not it's probably not so small when you have first cousin meeting and and typically in most

180
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:22,250
population the inbreeding coefficient is very small since just because most populations are not likely to have inbreeding between family,

181
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:34,340
between members of the family. However, there are some kind of specific there's you can have cultures or certain conditions that

182
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:43,129
encourage inbreeding coefficient and inbreeding between related related family members.

183
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:55,070
And that could be for kind of cultural reasons or reasons related to old practices or maybe preserve wealth.

184
00:24:55,130 --> 00:25:00,590
Or it could be just this population is maybe isolated and not likely to you're

185
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:07,400
not likely to meet or meet someone that's outside of your small neighbor.

186
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:12,540
Small of. Family.

187
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:14,070
Extended extended family.

188
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:29,120
And then in the United States, just to focus a little bit on the United States first cousin, marriages are not very common, so about 0.1%.

189
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:37,760
But it's also difficult to estimate because if they happen, they could be in rural areas or not likely to be reported.

190
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:44,420
And then they do account for about 6% of very homozygous disorders.

191
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:49,640
So they do kind of contribute to a higher prevalence of recessive disorders.

192
00:25:54,440 --> 00:26:07,249
I'm just looking over how laws of marriage between first cousins kind of vary across states and most states,

193
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:14,900
like 25 and 25 states, it is illegal marriage between first cousins is illegal.

194
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:22,820
There are some states that would allow it as long as one individual is not able to have children.

195
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:33,260
Again, that's just to try to avoid having recessive disorders show up or they require like a physician certificate of genetic counseling.

196
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:40,490
North Carolina apparently allows first cousins to marry, but not if they're double first cousins.

197
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:44,270
So not if the mom and dad are cousins themselves, I guess.

198
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:49,640
Or yeah, both parents most precious experience are cousins.

199
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:59,649
I guess this this website shows is that cousin couples dot com but I tried to access that website it's not and it's not there

200
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:11,830
anymore so don't try it but just showing that they do happen still the first cousin marriages end in case any questions about that.

201
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:36,400
Okay. Well. So I guess now we can if you want to work on your problem set to, um.

202
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:41,170
Yeah. I feel like last time most people started working on problem set to.

203
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,870
Did you guys finish or.

204
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:49,120
Just like to have questions about the practice problems.

205
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:55,060
So how many did you finish the practice problems or most of it.

206
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:04,120
So maybe spent like if you want to, we can go over the answers if you want today for the practice problems,

207
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:08,439
it could be helpful for you first before you finish the problem.

208
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:18,100
Step three So I know your time may be workload on the practice problems so we can go over the answers if we have time.

209
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:22,840
And I'm going to be posting the solutions also today for the practice problems.

210
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:29,979
So just go ahead and get started.

211
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:36,820
And then I think I have a question about the kind of the analysis because when you talk about it,

212
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:42,610
so for those things, basically looking at most likely scenario, I mean,

213
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:52,390
you can probably fit and like I have just like X-linked dominant, you can fit in maybe X-linked recessive,

214
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:59,380
but then you would be making a lot of assumptions like people coming from outside the pedigree are kind of carriers and so on.

215
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:06,670
So the maybe the most likely scenario, think of it as the one where you have to make the least amount of assumptions.

216
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:11,610
So that helps. But. Okay.

217
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:14,023
So. Yeah.

218
00:29:20,295 --> 00:29:28,265
Okay. So we announced this.

219
00:29:30,345 --> 00:29:37,665
So for each of those pedigree, we're asked to kind of say which one you think is the most likely mode of inheritance,

220
00:29:38,295 --> 00:29:47,535
and then fill in the potential genotypes and then think about what other possible means and other possible inheritance links that we can have.

221
00:29:49,395 --> 00:29:55,965
So what do you guys think about pedigree one? You.

222
00:30:10,105 --> 00:30:17,255
Yeah, I was almost done with that. So he's looking at every individual.

223
00:30:19,725 --> 00:30:29,175
Has an affair. Every affected individual has an effective pair, and we don't see more males and females carrying the disease.

224
00:30:32,505 --> 00:30:36,345
And then so they in the the genotypes.

225
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:46,184
Assuming this person is big D, small d, usually having victim experience.

226
00:30:46,185 --> 00:30:56,265
It was serious and probably someone that just came over for the other defendants.

227
00:30:59,285 --> 00:31:04,755
And in other modes of inheritance it could be horizontal, recessive.

228
00:31:04,905 --> 00:31:14,535
We assume that those individuals are carriers of this one.

229
00:31:14,535 --> 00:31:18,225
And then you see that these two, this person who the carrier.

230
00:31:24,565 --> 00:31:30,714
And then for for x things, etc. Then we required this individual here to be a carrier.

231
00:31:30,715 --> 00:31:38,455
And then. We've seen questions about that.

232
00:31:41,605 --> 00:31:45,505
Okay. This one. Me too.

233
00:31:47,635 --> 00:31:57,515
But he didn't. He was the most likely. Yeah.

234
00:31:59,495 --> 00:32:07,955
X-linked recessive. So it's more for autism or recessive?

235
00:32:13,385 --> 00:32:19,535
Yes. What did you assume for excellent detective? Yeah, I guess that since that dad doesn't have.

236
00:32:20,185 --> 00:32:28,895
Yeah, some of these, like, kidnaped, like, just go by, like, the least number of assumptions that you would have to make.

237
00:32:34,015 --> 00:32:44,975
The genotypes filled in and the excellent recessive do not like because this individual is not affected here.

238
00:32:49,395 --> 00:32:56,865
Okay. Category three time X-linked recessive.

239
00:32:58,335 --> 00:33:02,205
Obviously more males are only males being affected.

240
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:13,095
There's no mother son transmission and see the feel of the gene at times.

241
00:33:17,405 --> 00:33:28,955
Question to A So is that in this category, a man is affected by a form of albinism, and then what is the probability?

242
00:33:28,955 --> 00:33:31,895
We're asked to look at the probability of their grandson.

243
00:33:31,985 --> 00:33:40,235
So Individual A and his great granddaughter and B are both heterozygous carriers of albinism,

244
00:33:40,235 --> 00:33:45,905
causing any of them positive so that people who are entering the pedigree.

245
00:33:46,205 --> 00:33:56,165
So this person here, this person here are not carriers of the albinism.

246
00:33:58,285 --> 00:34:06,945
So we have to calculate the probability that individual is a carrier and then an individual vs a character.

247
00:34:07,205 --> 00:34:11,875
So we would do the calculations for that.

248
00:34:17,865 --> 00:34:20,875
He was point five and views point to.

249
00:34:22,545 --> 00:34:29,985
Yeah. And then to get the public view of what's happening then, because the question is asking.

250
00:34:31,095 --> 00:34:34,095
I believe that both A and B are heterozygous.

251
00:34:34,095 --> 00:34:41,295
So then you would multiply the point five and the point five.

252
00:34:41,775 --> 00:34:59,235
Yeah. So we're going to assume that since it's all recessive and this is.

253
00:35:01,945 --> 00:35:07,645
So this person is dead and then this person is like dead.

254
00:35:08,425 --> 00:35:12,055
And they said that those two people are not hers.

255
00:35:15,285 --> 00:35:25,964
So. So going to this person, the probability that there are a carrier or that they have the DB alone is sort of one.

256
00:35:25,965 --> 00:35:35,805
Because if we do the table of meeting those two people and the probability of transmitting that carrier is one here.

257
00:35:36,735 --> 00:35:43,395
So this multi. And then and then this person will be a carrier.

258
00:35:44,955 --> 00:35:49,815
And then because they're not effective, they can't be small decently.

259
00:35:50,385 --> 00:36:00,195
And then they're probably inheriting the business here in this house and then carrying over into here.

260
00:36:02,385 --> 00:36:10,935
And the probability of the grandparent is a carrier is one we have have here and have here.

261
00:36:12,195 --> 00:36:24,375
So so individual a being a carrier is taxed individually as this one times half and then half times half.

262
00:36:25,125 --> 00:36:32,425
That's one fourth for individuals. B And then to get both of them, then we would multiply both.

263
00:36:32,595 --> 00:36:36,105
Yeah. How did you know that the grandmother was a carrier?

264
00:36:36,975 --> 00:36:45,735
This person here? Yeah, I was thinking about that.

265
00:36:47,615 --> 00:36:54,455
So what would you assume that she's going to do? I guess I wouldn't know.

266
00:36:58,445 --> 00:37:02,585
But even then, yeah, it will. It be. It will, in fact, I guess.

267
00:37:03,605 --> 00:37:11,675
So if it's Dee Dee Dee, the original planning table can go both ways.

268
00:37:11,945 --> 00:37:16,055
Yeah. You can have like half chance healthy.

269
00:37:16,265 --> 00:37:19,474
Capital D, small D and it's the opposite.

270
00:37:19,475 --> 00:37:23,305
My console doesn't make the 53. The st will be this thing.

271
00:37:23,315 --> 00:37:27,695
Yeah. So you have like four offspring that we enjoyed. Based on that we have only two.

272
00:37:28,385 --> 00:37:34,535
Yeah. Well I guess the, the main key is that the probability of inheriting the responsibility would still be one.

273
00:37:35,885 --> 00:37:42,885
So if we assume that this person here is big Dee Dee.

274
00:37:47,705 --> 00:37:50,625
And the problem is, if you do the table here,

275
00:37:51,945 --> 00:37:59,205
then the probability of inheriting the recessive of a recessive small d would still be one like all the individuals would be carriers.

276
00:38:01,275 --> 00:38:07,665
And then if you assume that it's big this mosey, then you would still have.

277
00:38:09,195 --> 00:38:13,455
But we don't have any affected individuals will still be this thing.

278
00:38:15,125 --> 00:38:23,905
Yeah. Your risk. Two more questions that.

279
00:38:34,115 --> 00:38:37,195
Individuals and where to have a child together.

280
00:38:37,215 --> 00:38:46,575
What is the probability that their child would be affected? So would you like to see that?

281
00:38:51,285 --> 00:38:59,335
So that would be a multiplication of. The one fourth and the 28 that we got here also.

282
00:39:00,915 --> 00:39:06,685
So both carriers from being a carrier here and a carrier here.

283
00:39:07,405 --> 00:39:41,425
So that would be one of the things. The questions.

284
00:39:53,935 --> 00:40:03,564
So we're meeting one this this person B carrier is to have and then this person is that it's a forth and

285
00:40:03,565 --> 00:40:09,675
then probability of them meeting and having him an individual would be adding another like a house.

286
00:40:10,135 --> 00:40:19,545
So that that's how you would get to the. To the probability of a child being affected.

287
00:40:24,185 --> 00:40:36,174
Yeah. Okay. And then we kind of did question three A and I'll post the solution three and see how we

288
00:40:36,175 --> 00:40:43,765
laid out all the possible pedigree probabilities and how to compare their properties.

289
00:40:44,365 --> 00:40:49,255
So that was that after today.

290
00:40:50,695 --> 00:40:56,355
Any questions? Okay.

291
00:40:59,035 --> 00:41:01,415
So that's it for today.
