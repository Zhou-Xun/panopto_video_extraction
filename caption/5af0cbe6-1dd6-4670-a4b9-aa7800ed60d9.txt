1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,490
My name is Peris, I'm
an Associate Professor in

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:03,930
the Department of Epidemiology

3
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:05,985
here at the University
of Michigan.

4
00:00:05,985 --> 00:00:08,400
My research right
now is focused on

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,095
the full continuum of

6
00:00:10,095 --> 00:00:13,110
ovarian cancer from
primary prevention,

7
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:14,520
trying to prevent
the disease from

8
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,020
happening in the first place,

9
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:19,020
all the way to
tertiary prevention which

10
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,455
is addressing the needs of
ovarian cancer survivors.

11
00:00:22,455 --> 00:00:25,490
I really can't pinpoint
one or the other that

12
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:28,370
I enjoy and I'm most

13
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:30,350
passionate about because
I really believe for

14
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:32,330
ovarian cancer it takes

15
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:37,715
the full continuum to make
a difference in this disease.

16
00:00:37,715 --> 00:00:40,430
So when we think about
primary prevention,

17
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:42,560
that's preventing the disease
from occurring in

18
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,750
the first place and
with ovarian cancer,

19
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:47,410
we have a number of strategies.

20
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:50,690
One of them is chemoprevention
which means using

21
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:51,800
a drug to prevent

22
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,210
the disease and in the case
of ovarian cancer,

23
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:56,705
that drug is really
oral contraceptives.

24
00:00:56,705 --> 00:00:58,310
That's pretty remarkable that

25
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:00,080
using oral contraceptives for

26
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,895
five years can cut

27
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:04,835
a woman's risk of
ovarian cancer in half.

28
00:01:04,835 --> 00:01:09,035
It's quite profound
and has a big impact.

29
00:01:09,035 --> 00:01:12,290
In fact, you can look
back and see that it has

30
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:16,015
reduced the incidence
of ovarian cancer.

31
00:01:16,015 --> 00:01:18,170
Now, we have to take
into account that when

32
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:20,570
a woman is on
oral contraceptives,

33
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:23,660
her risk of breast cancer
is increased but

34
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:26,975
that's only while
she's on the pill.

35
00:01:26,975 --> 00:01:29,990
So the timing of use is quite

36
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:32,930
important that it's
done when a woman is

37
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:36,740
at low risk of
breast cancer so that we

38
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:40,650
aren't increasing the number

39
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:43,620
of breast cancer cases
dramatically.

40
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:47,585
But the chemo preventive benefits

41
00:01:47,585 --> 00:01:49,760
of oral contraceptives for

42
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,710
ovarian cancer can't be ignored.

43
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:53,720
So one of the reasons that I am

44
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,240
so keen on primary prevention

45
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,115
for ovarian cancer is

46
00:01:58,115 --> 00:02:00,750
that ovarian cancer
is a deadly disease,

47
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:04,320
five-year survival is
less than 50 percent.

48
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,614
We could change that if
women were diagnosed

49
00:02:08,614 --> 00:02:10,790
early but the majority
of ovarian cancers

50
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:13,100
are diagnosed at a late stage.

51
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:17,120
There have been tremendous
efforts to try to develop

52
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,340
a screening test for
ovarian cancer but

53
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:22,415
those have largely
been unsuccessful.

54
00:02:22,415 --> 00:02:25,835
So it's unfortunate that

55
00:02:25,835 --> 00:02:28,190
there isn't screening for
ovarian cancer and they're

56
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,080
certainly ongoing research and

57
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,990
some suggestion that
we may ultimately

58
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:35,420
have a screening test that

59
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:38,370
has the needed sensitivity
and specificity,

60
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:40,230
but right now there isn't.

61
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:43,520
Right now my research has
taken an interesting turn into

62
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,350
a new area for me which is

63
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:47,750
related to tertiary prevention.

64
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,840
So that's trying to prevent

65
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,855
further consequences
of having the disease.

66
00:02:54,855 --> 00:02:57,440
What we're doing
right now is using

67
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,335
novel technology eHealth apps

68
00:03:00,335 --> 00:03:03,320
to try to improve

69
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:07,140
the life purpose of
ovarian cancer survivors.

70
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,720
We think that will be related

71
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,280
to improvements in quality of

72
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,900
life which have
been shown to lead

73
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,895
to improvements in survival.

74
00:03:13,895 --> 00:03:16,550
So this is an exciting
new area where we have

75
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:19,535
the opportunity to
empower women to

76
00:03:19,535 --> 00:03:21,649
take their health
into their own hands

77
00:03:21,649 --> 00:03:25,190
and make a difference ultimately.

78
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:30,200
So this work has been funded and

79
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,180
we are just about to get

80
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,950
the initial study up and going

81
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:36,560
here at the University
of Michigan.

82
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,390
What's really amazing about

83
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:41,780
the ovarian cancer field is
that almost 20 years ago,

84
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:45,500
we all came together and
agreed to pool our resources,

85
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:49,565
our knowledge, the research
we had done to date

86
00:03:49,565 --> 00:03:53,900
and work together to
understand ovarian cancer.

87
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,300
Both why it develops and

88
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,835
the factors associated
with survival.

89
00:03:58,835 --> 00:04:00,980
There are two large consortia

90
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:03,170
working toward this
that I'm directly

91
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:07,725
involved in and that's
they're international,

92
00:04:07,725 --> 00:04:11,645
they comprise thousands of

93
00:04:11,645 --> 00:04:13,130
ovarian cancer patients and

94
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:15,890
healthy women who have
donated their time,

95
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:17,120
their information,

96
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,010
their biologic samples to help

97
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:21,080
us understand this disease.

98
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:25,370
Often in academia, people
can be siloed and not

99
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:30,190
work together and also not
even cross different fields.

100
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,785
But in ovarian cancer,

101
00:04:31,785 --> 00:04:35,450
we all work together and we are

102
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:39,620
a multidisciplinary
group, its core.

103
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:42,860
So I'm just excited to

104
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:46,535
watch this grow as it has
over the last 20 years,

105
00:04:46,535 --> 00:04:50,795
and we really come to understand
more about the disease.

106
00:04:50,795 --> 00:04:52,430
We're doing research now where

107
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:55,235
we're taking epidemiologic
information,

108
00:04:55,235 --> 00:04:57,410
pairing it with what
we understand about

109
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:00,155
immunology and genomics to

110
00:05:00,155 --> 00:05:05,120
really gain clues into
how to better treat women

111
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,460
with ovarian cancer and how to

112
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:10,540
prevent the disease from
occurring in the first place.

113
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:13,420
Another really exciting changes

114
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,860
as we've come to understand that

115
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,840
ovarian cancer develops in

116
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,340
the fallopian tubes
much of the time,

117
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:23,980
is that almost every major
gynecologic organization

118
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:27,850
across the world has
recommended that women who

119
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:30,850
are having pelvic surgery

120
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:34,360
whether it's a hysterectomy
or intending to just

121
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,990
have their tubes tied
to go ahead and have

122
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:40,030
their fallopian tubes removed as

123
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:42,910
a preventive strategy
for ovarian cancer.

124
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:46,765
That's really quite
revolutionary to to think about.

125
00:05:46,765 --> 00:05:49,840
Of course it's not as simple
as all that because we don't

126
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,305
yet know whether or not
that will be effective.

127
00:05:53,305 --> 00:05:54,860
Certainly all of the science that

128
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,490
we have suggests it will.

129
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,550
But it will take
a few more years to really

130
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:02,435
understand the impact
of that practice.

131
00:06:02,435 --> 00:06:04,850
Of course we have to take into

132
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:06,980
account whether or not there are

133
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:09,080
downstream consequences
of removing

134
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,150
the fallopian tubes
with respect to

135
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:13,535
potentially initiating
early menopause.

136
00:06:13,535 --> 00:06:15,770
We don't think that's
going to be a problem but

137
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:18,380
again there is
more research to be done.

138
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:21,380
But ultimately, what
we have learned about

139
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:24,395
ovarian cancer over
the past 20 years has

140
00:06:24,395 --> 00:06:28,400
led us to this point where
it really makes a lot

141
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:33,493
of sense to consider
these prevention opportunities.
