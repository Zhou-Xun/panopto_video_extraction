1
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:06,930
All right. All right.

2
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:10,770
So let's just start going over the exercise.

3
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:15,930
I just wanna make sure you have enough time to go over the questions. So the six.

4
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:20,500
Any. Any thoughts before we get started? Okay, for the moment.

5
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:29,100
So I just want to point out really fast, I think you've got this is the the sort of salient point here is that we're

6
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:33,560
looking at regular versus irregular toothbrushing as a screening tool for the.

7
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:41,340
And so then given that the screening questionnaire asked about the frequency of daily tooth brushing,

8
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:47,010
which response would be would you use as a positive screen for the presence of.

9
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:52,680
What do you think is a good proxy for how much someone does in the mouth?

10
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:03,600
It's like we already know we are going to work through the two by two table and how to set it up.

11
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:09,720
Okay. So, oh, we can just go through this.

12
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:21,300
If we look at the table one that we were given erm we see that the presents, we see that the total population,

13
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:34,320
the total number of people with dental floss is 415 and so we would put this in the margin of focus.

14
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:43,350
Okay. What word on does anybody want to take a guess as to what I would put in these cells?

15
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:49,790
Yeah. The Tories have people who are irregular Russian versus.

16
00:01:49,790 --> 00:02:02,840
Right. Exactly. And who looking at this table when I put in myself.

17
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:11,180
Yeah. 123. Yep.

18
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:20,010
Exactly. Put less. So now that we have this sort of sorted out, we can just needs math to find for the total studies.

19
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:24,160
That's what they do. How is this looking so far to everyone?

20
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:28,380
Any questions about where these numbers are coming from? All right, cool.

21
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:33,780
And now that we know these values and all that ID so it. Okay.

22
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:38,460
How is everyone's results looking with regard to the table?

23
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,520
Any questions? All right.

24
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:53,430
Okay. So then they asked if the prevalence of dental plaque doubled in the population with the sensitivity, specificity and the PPV change in any way.

25
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:57,090
So first things first. Going to a two by two table.

26
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:07,790
What, um. What number would double, I guess, or further?

27
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:13,350
What? What two values here would have to double in order for this to be true.

28
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:20,930
Are we expecting a change? Complete A, simply a, b, c or D or RV?

29
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:28,240
Are we expecting a change in an entire category of people? Oh, yeah.

30
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:33,140
Entire category. Yeah. Which one? 450.

31
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:37,440
Exactly. So they don't. So they they say that the prevalence doubles.

32
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:44,880
When I was working on this at home, I just sort of adjusted this and then sort of adjusted the cells to kind of fit.

33
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:49,920
But that it's getting at the sort of the same concept of they're not telling

34
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:55,799
us whether or not any particular subgroup of individuals changed by a number.

35
00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:04,980
They're just saying as the whole as total say we have more folks with dental plaque in this particular scenario.

36
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:13,350
How would we how would our calculations change? So then what we can take away, what we can assume is that A and C change.

37
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:19,750
So then how like what would what would happen and couldn't?

38
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:28,770
So does anybody want to take a stab at whether the sensitivity or specificity would change?

39
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:35,729
Wouldn't you want the sensitivity to increase? Because like, it's going to be like I thought of it's like HIV,

40
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:40,830
like HIV and like going around with the sensitivity of the test to be like the increase.

41
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:52,520
Okay. Mm hmm. Yep. So prevalence and increase in an increase in our total margin also means that regular brushing increases.

42
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,680
So. Yes. So yeah. So PPV would increase.

43
00:04:56,670 --> 00:05:08,020
Oh. And then to answer. I'm sorry. Sensitivity doesn't change because that is a function of the the test itself that the plaque.

44
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,390
But your your ability to detect it does hurt like.

45
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:16,780
Yeah. Do the prevalence does. All righty.

46
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,780
So. So yeah. So sensitivity is a characteristic of our test.

47
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:28,020
It is looking at this column specifically. It's not going to change the specificity.

48
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:34,110
Same. This is a characteristic of the test. It's not like anything but these values.

49
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:38,370
These values over here are going to change with the population.

50
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,559
So are proportion. Yeah, I have a question.

51
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:48,060
When they asked you to like recreate the and have the recalculate each measure, like,

52
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:54,240
do you just change that one column even though like if the population is like double the

53
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,760
prevalence like with like for a whole population you're not looking at like isn't one one,

54
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:11,459
two, three, five oh, is that the whole population or is that just isn't that just like those people chose to increase, let's see.

55
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:18,630
Absent of the well, they're not suggesting that there's misclassification.

56
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:28,530
So all of this would sort of the margins would change a little bit because you're doubling this guy.

57
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,730
And so by by virtue of that, you're you're sort of adjusting these.

58
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:36,150
And so that will address these guys and ultimately this.

59
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:44,129
Does that make sense? So they're not telling us like we miss categorize people that we like.

60
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:44,850
We missed people.

61
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:52,470
All they're just saying is the presence, the existence of different plaque in our population has increased, or rather the number of people.

62
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:57,450
And so we just assume that this study gets doubled again.

63
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:00,570
They're not really telling us how these are changing.

64
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:10,590
You could try to, you know, make them network so that the possible but in order to so that your overall population might change as

65
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:15,000
well absent of any other sort of misclassification which we're going to talk about in just a moment.

66
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:20,010
All right. So the misclassification.

67
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:27,690
So then if the screening questionnaire was revised to define regular toothbrushing as at least once a day or more,

68
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:36,870
what would be well, what would we expect to see? And like, where would we expect to see our our population?

69
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:40,040
Or how would we expect to see.

70
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:56,070
Excuse me. So we're basically saying regular brushing is now defined as at least once per day.

71
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:08,649
So those who aren't your passive arms would go down. For not lowering the inclusion criteria, though.

72
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:14,250
So more people are going to like more people who brushing regularly are going to be grouped as regular.

73
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:23,460
So. Previously, we were defining anything less than twice a day as your regular.

74
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:35,579
But now that we're opening it up to just once a day, our regulars will be lower, look lower,

75
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:40,410
and regular brushing will increase because we're defining regular brushing now as at least once per day,

76
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:48,840
not decreasing sensitivity because you have that specificity.

77
00:08:52,500 --> 00:09:04,319
So it will decrease sensitivity. We're changing a we're changing the population focused on A and the overall marginal total of the cell.

78
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:12,719
And then it also decrease our or increase our specificity because now the people that were once considered irregular were not classified as regular.

79
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,870
And so this number is increased. Does that make sense?

80
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:22,080
That's right. Did you have a question? Yeah, I had questions about like, can you give a chart for this one?

81
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,520
Because they're just not like, how do you like create new numbers? How do you create your numbers for this?

82
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:33,450
So they don't. So what I do or you can make it into a little one.

83
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,780
Oh, you don't have to name. Yeah.

84
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:43,510
But I mean, since they're not giving you like a particular quantity of misclassification or adjustment, I would just kind of pick them.

85
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:49,680
I just took some numbers. Yeah, that makes sense.

86
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:54,930
All right, well, that was the end of things. Any more questions? Okay. That went a lot faster than I expected.

87
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:08,450
I know this was a lot of lazy earnings, so I can choose to describe this in word and rephrasing.

88
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:15,590
Exactly what I just explained is just part of your answer in another word.

89
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:19,770
Reassure you that you can do everything if you write your table makes more sense.

90
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:25,080
Oh yeah. I haven't been negative. So is there a sensitivity about what has changed?

91
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:33,270
And then there'll be less people who are travel so little more because there is.

92
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:37,170
So I wouldn't be able to go through the survey.

93
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:48,760
They were looking at the compromise, so you should know which way people should use outside functions.

94
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:58,690
So holding hands with people can alter your color.

95
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:02,290
Oh yeah. Terms of like the problem or whatever.

96
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:15,239
So conflicted person would be like, that's probably fine, but you know, it's like, I swear, this experience is just a minute.

97
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:25,050
So it's just the same and I think it should be, which is.

98
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:29,940
Oh, I'm sorry. I just. Oh, that's your gift. Your double in the portrait.

99
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,719
Yeah, that's where it came from. Okay. But you're a difficult. So basically what?

100
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:38,770
That's so what we're basically saying. I just assume that that's okay.

101
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:42,330
Perfect excuse and then there's no way you can do it.

102
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:48,570
I did that when I was doing this. Exercise is just random. Some there.

103
00:11:50,160 --> 00:12:06,150
Yeah, I know. We're all right. I just have to keep the sensitivity and not just cause I've been working with the whole idea.

104
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:11,110
So you can delete it with whatever you think it's fun to do.

105
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:15,080
For three reasons.

106
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:27,020
Yeah, I'm sure it is.

107
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:32,560
I was here for the special.
