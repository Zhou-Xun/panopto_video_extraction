1
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:11,419
We've defined reflective listening for you.

2
00:00:11,419 --> 00:00:14,724
Now today we're going to take a look at some clips that

3
00:00:14,724 --> 00:00:16,568
demonstrate this key skill.

4
00:00:16,568 --> 00:00:20,970
Specifically, we're going to show you that there are different types or

5
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:23,106
levels of reflective statements.

6
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:27,411
Here are the three main types of reflective response is simple,

7
00:00:27,411 --> 00:00:29,490
complex and interventional.

8
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:32,924
Simple is defined as you have not created any new insights,

9
00:00:32,924 --> 00:00:36,778
you have not inferred anything, you have not connected any dots.

10
00:00:36,778 --> 00:00:40,044
You're simply tracking the surface facts of the story.

11
00:00:40,044 --> 00:00:44,807
You're reflecting back to the patient or client that you're tracking this story.

12
00:00:44,807 --> 00:00:48,057
It's a very important type of reflection, but

13
00:00:48,057 --> 00:00:51,234
it's not necessarily as deeply insightful.

14
00:00:51,234 --> 00:00:55,468
It's not necessarily as emotionally impactful, but it's still important to use

15
00:00:55,468 --> 00:00:58,626
content reflections to communicate on tracking your story.

16
00:00:58,626 --> 00:01:03,396
Complex reflections are called that because you are adding something to

17
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:04,186
the story.

18
00:01:04,186 --> 00:01:10,094
You're inferring a feeling or a meaning or you're connecting dots as to who,

19
00:01:10,094 --> 00:01:13,413
I think it may be doing that because of this.

20
00:01:13,413 --> 00:01:18,812
When you do a good, complex reflection, the patient is often quite appreciative

21
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:23,992
and is often sort of shocked for a second in a good way that you figured that out.

22
00:01:23,992 --> 00:01:25,980
The third type is called interventional.

23
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:28,837
Now, what's a subtype of the complex reflection and

24
00:01:28,837 --> 00:01:32,910
what it involves is trying to move the person specifically towards change.

25
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:34,613
In the case of amplified negative,

26
00:01:34,613 --> 00:01:37,807
we're trying to exhaust the negativity that they possibly have.

27
00:01:37,807 --> 00:01:41,784
We are trying to exhaust their resistance and trying to move them towards Yes, or

28
00:01:41,784 --> 00:01:45,717
trying to move them north in the case of an action reflection as well, show you.

29
00:01:45,717 --> 00:01:49,693
Were trying to let the person make a plan of action or set a goal.

30
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:53,208
Let us start with our first clip that will demonstrate a content reflection.

31
00:01:53,208 --> 00:01:54,475
Take a look.

32
00:01:54,475 --> 00:01:58,565
>> Okay, so like you giving her a choice, you've been able to cut out one serving or

33
00:01:58,565 --> 00:01:59,421
so from dinner.

34
00:01:59,421 --> 00:02:01,817
And even her older brother has gotten on board.

35
00:02:01,817 --> 00:02:03,103
>> Yeah, I'm kind of relieved.

36
00:02:03,103 --> 00:02:05,684
It wasn't as difficult as I thought.

37
00:02:05,684 --> 00:02:10,452
>> So what you see here is the listener showing the patient that he or

38
00:02:10,452 --> 00:02:12,493
she is tracking the story.

39
00:02:12,493 --> 00:02:16,293
There's not a lot of inference, there's not a lot of emotional words,

40
00:02:16,293 --> 00:02:18,484
there's not a lot of poetry or metaphor.

41
00:02:18,484 --> 00:02:21,687
But there's a solid reflection back that I get your story.

42
00:02:21,687 --> 00:02:22,811
I'm tracking it.

43
00:02:22,811 --> 00:02:24,667
I'm not judging you.

44
00:02:24,667 --> 00:02:27,729
Now, let's look at the first of our complex reflections,

45
00:02:27,729 --> 00:02:29,759
which is called a feeling reflection.

46
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:31,160
Take a look.

47
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:35,273
>> Exactly, and then it makes me feel like, I've let her down.

48
00:02:35,273 --> 00:02:40,774
Like I'm I'm lazy or something because I've allowed her to watch so much TV.

49
00:02:40,774 --> 00:02:45,165
And I know I haven't been the best role model in that area.

50
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:50,239
And it just makes you feel really bad because you're their mom.

51
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,173
>> So you're disappointed in your role.

52
00:02:53,173 --> 00:03:00,162
And you feel like being more active might be good for both you and Vanessa.

53
00:03:00,162 --> 00:03:02,684
>> What I hear from you is when he's active, you're happy.

54
00:03:02,684 --> 00:03:06,719
Like when he's moving around, you feel like you're being a better mom.

55
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:07,583
>> Yeah, I do.

56
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:08,789
I do.

57
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:13,725
>> So here the listener uses some feeling word generally not yet

58
00:03:13,725 --> 00:03:15,475
used by the patient.

59
00:03:15,475 --> 00:03:20,299
The therapist, the listener is inferring the emotion.

60
00:03:20,299 --> 00:03:22,771
That's why it's called a complex reflection.

61
00:03:22,771 --> 00:03:28,166
Here, let's take a look at a really wonderful movie clip that

62
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:34,313
captures both a meaning reflection, but also this idea of metaphor.

63
00:03:34,313 --> 00:03:35,712
Take a look.

64
00:03:35,712 --> 00:03:38,607
>> I want to use a big wooden fork.

65
00:03:38,607 --> 00:03:41,305
>> No. >> You're not really useful unless you're

66
00:03:41,305 --> 00:03:44,928
fighting off three vampires that were huddled together.

67
00:03:44,928 --> 00:03:47,101
>> I really wish I had my hammer.

68
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:47,611
>> Hammer?

69
00:03:47,611 --> 00:03:48,517
>> Quite unique.

70
00:03:48,517 --> 00:03:52,564
Was made from this special metal from the heart of a dying star.

71
00:03:52,564 --> 00:03:53,976
And when I spun it really, really fast.

72
00:03:53,976 --> 00:03:55,321
It gave me the ability to fly.

73
00:03:55,321 --> 00:03:56,636
>> You wrote a hammer.

74
00:03:56,636 --> 00:03:58,789
>> No, I didn't ride down the camera.

75
00:03:58,789 --> 00:03:59,580
>> You on your back.

76
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:03,574
>> No, I spin it really fast and it would pull me off.

77
00:04:03,574 --> 00:04:05,242
>> My God, am I pulled you off.

78
00:04:05,242 --> 00:04:08,301
>> The ground, pull me off the ground up into the air.

79
00:04:08,301 --> 00:04:12,641
And I would fly every time I threw it would always come back to me.

80
00:04:12,641 --> 00:04:13,986
>> It sounds like you had a pretty special and

81
00:04:13,986 --> 00:04:15,375
intimate relationship with this hammer.

82
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:19,390
And then losing it was almost comparable to losing a loved one.

83
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:21,740
>> It's a nice way of putting it.

84
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:26,554
>> When the therapist reflects back that losing your sword was

85
00:04:26,554 --> 00:04:29,160
almost like losing a loved one.

86
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:33,272
The patient Chris Hemsworth responded very positively.

87
00:04:33,272 --> 00:04:36,557
He was actually quite grateful for that metaphoric or

88
00:04:36,557 --> 00:04:39,773
poetic interpretation of the meaning of the sword.

89
00:04:39,773 --> 00:04:41,268
Throughout the course,

90
00:04:41,268 --> 00:04:46,335
we're going to emphasize that you execute that you implement that poetic license.

91
00:04:46,335 --> 00:04:52,395
Patients often are very appreciative of you making a story a narrative or

92
00:04:52,395 --> 00:04:54,888
a metaphor out of their life.

93
00:04:54,888 --> 00:04:57,461
Now, let's look at double sided reflections.

94
00:04:57,461 --> 00:05:00,446
>> I mean, she's a little big for her age.

95
00:05:00,446 --> 00:05:04,685
I mean, she's six, but sometimes people think she's a little bit older.

96
00:05:04,685 --> 00:05:08,160
But I don't want her to look too skinny though

97
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,010
because I think people like that look unhealthy.

98
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:17,899
>> But we do have a lot of diabetes in our family.

99
00:05:17,899 --> 00:05:19,071
>> So, >> So right now,

100
00:05:19,071 --> 00:05:24,843
although you're not too worried, you're really not too worried about her weight.

101
00:05:24,843 --> 00:05:28,255
You do want to make sure that the weight doesn't become a health problem in

102
00:05:28,255 --> 00:05:28,870
the future.

103
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,650
>> So it's a convenience for you.

104
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:34,911
But you realize it's not the healthiest thing for Michael or for you and

105
00:05:34,911 --> 00:05:35,772
your family.

106
00:05:35,772 --> 00:05:39,464
>> Here, we're trying to capture the ambivalence of the patient,

107
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:42,364
something you'll see in almost every encounter.

108
00:05:42,364 --> 00:05:43,739
There's some degree of ambivalence.

109
00:05:43,739 --> 00:05:47,791
So, this is a very widely used type of reflection, [INAUDIBLE] What it's saying

110
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:51,299
fundamentally, as part of you wants to, part of you scared part of,

111
00:05:51,299 --> 00:05:54,274
you know what would be good for you to change his behavior.

112
00:05:54,274 --> 00:05:55,986
But part of you likes it.

113
00:05:55,986 --> 00:06:00,804
So double sided reflections are one of the most common types that you will use in

114
00:06:00,804 --> 00:06:01,973
your counseling.

115
00:06:01,973 --> 00:06:06,788
Here's when we talked about a fair bit, it's one of the major strategies to

116
00:06:06,788 --> 00:06:09,885
achieve that goal of comforting the afflicted.

117
00:06:09,885 --> 00:06:12,702
Let's take a look at some rolling with resistance.

118
00:06:12,702 --> 00:06:15,485
>> Regular day would be after school.

119
00:06:15,485 --> 00:06:20,187
>> She generally watches a couple of hours of kid shows.

120
00:06:20,187 --> 00:06:22,801
My shift is 8-3.

121
00:06:22,801 --> 00:06:27,374
So when I get off work were generally home by about the same time.

122
00:06:27,374 --> 00:06:32,975
Normally she will watch TV while I'm I'm going through male or

123
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:36,364
I'm cleaning up or starting dinner.

124
00:06:36,364 --> 00:06:41,132
>> So actually we're watching TV right now frees you up to do some of what

125
00:06:41,132 --> 00:06:43,774
you need to get done in the afternoon.

126
00:06:43,774 --> 00:06:47,194
>> You see that's really hard because it's fast.

127
00:06:47,194 --> 00:06:49,879
It's cheap and he loves it.

128
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:54,359
I mean with our busy schedule, it sometimes just seems easier to run and

129
00:06:54,359 --> 00:06:56,682
pick up burger king most of the time.

130
00:06:56,682 --> 00:07:01,066
Plus when I pick him up from daycare, Michael's usually so hungry.

131
00:07:01,066 --> 00:07:06,394
But he's really cranky and I just want to feed him anything as long as it's fast.

132
00:07:06,394 --> 00:07:09,244
>> So he's really irritable when you get him and

133
00:07:09,244 --> 00:07:11,870
you want to get something in him quickly.

134
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,622
>> She said, no, she didn't want to do it alone.

135
00:07:13,622 --> 00:07:15,288
She didn't want to do it with me.

136
00:07:15,288 --> 00:07:17,930
>> That sounds like a difficult one to get that.

137
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:18,717
>> It's really hard.

138
00:07:18,717 --> 00:07:21,725
Like I said, I'm almost to the point where I'm just gonna tell her you're gonna

139
00:07:21,725 --> 00:07:22,268
do it anyway.

140
00:07:22,268 --> 00:07:24,586
So what you see is rolling with resistance and

141
00:07:24,586 --> 00:07:28,862
tails fundamentally agreeing with the patient, not by saying, I agree with you.

142
00:07:28,862 --> 00:07:33,063
But with you statements you communicate that I'm not going to argue with you that

143
00:07:33,063 --> 00:07:35,427
your subjective reality is correct for you.

144
00:07:35,427 --> 00:07:38,707
>> For now we may progress to afflicting the comfortable,

145
00:07:38,707 --> 00:07:41,792
but at this point if it's early on in the encounter.

146
00:07:41,792 --> 00:07:45,060
We're going to generally roll with the resistance and

147
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,126
use reflections to communicate.

148
00:07:47,126 --> 00:07:48,649
>> I get it. >> This is where you are.

149
00:07:48,649 --> 00:07:51,571
I'm not trying to change you.
