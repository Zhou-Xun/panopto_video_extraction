1
00:00:09,711 --> 00:00:14,215
Using a study of problem drinkers we're gonna look at the effects of

2
00:00:14,215 --> 00:00:18,416
telling people what to do and how more autonomous motivation.

3
00:00:18,416 --> 00:00:23,184
Doing things because you really want to produces much better outcomes

4
00:00:23,184 --> 00:00:25,535
than pressure, shame and guilt.

5
00:00:25,535 --> 00:00:29,229
We're going to use the California Drinker study to help us understand both

6
00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:31,740
the theory and practice of me.

7
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:36,838
The study involved 659 problem drinkers recruited in northern California they

8
00:00:36,838 --> 00:00:42,091
recruited them from two different pools, a community sample and a clinical sample.

9
00:00:42,091 --> 00:00:44,403
Then they followed them for five years,

10
00:00:44,403 --> 00:00:47,600
measuring them at 1:3 and five years post baseline.

11
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,326
At the one year follow up,

12
00:00:49,326 --> 00:00:54,349
they gave them 10 pathways to change what we're gonna look at in a minute is

13
00:00:54,349 --> 00:01:00,340
how these one year reports correlated with their five year drinking status.

14
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:03,406
What we see here are odds ratios in this case,

15
00:01:03,406 --> 00:01:07,609
the odds of continuous abstinence at the five year follow up.

16
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:11,851
Remember, odds ratios are anchored around the number one if the odds ratio is

17
00:01:11,851 --> 00:01:16,223
greater than one, then the independent variable is associated with greater in

18
00:01:16,223 --> 00:01:19,140
this case, rates of long term abstinence.

19
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,758
If the number is less than one it means that variable was a predictor of higher

20
00:01:23,758 --> 00:01:26,155
relapse or lower rates of abstinence.

21
00:01:26,155 --> 00:01:29,105
Let's start by looking at the first predictor

22
00:01:29,105 --> 00:01:32,592
hit rock bottom in the community sample individuals.

23
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:36,480
Who reported at the one year follow up that they quit drinking as they hit rock

24
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:36,990
bottom.

25
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:41,031
Four years later, we're 4.4 times more likely to still be not drinking than those

26
00:01:41,031 --> 00:01:43,735
who didn't check that reason and the treatment sample.

27
00:01:43,735 --> 00:01:47,448
And there are 1.9 times more likely to still be not drinking than those who

28
00:01:47,448 --> 00:01:49,850
didn't check that reason so it was protective.

29
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:54,663
It was a predictor of long term abstinence number two traumatic event hitting

30
00:01:54,663 --> 00:01:57,411
someone with your car being thrown in jail.

31
00:01:57,411 --> 00:02:01,941
People who check this reason we're 2.7 times more likely in the community sample

32
00:02:01,941 --> 00:02:02,978
and 2.2 times.

33
00:02:02,978 --> 00:02:06,843
More likely in the clinical sample to Still be not drinking at five

34
00:02:06,843 --> 00:02:09,524
year follow up now let's look at DR Warning.

35
00:02:09,524 --> 00:02:13,696
There was only enough statistical power to look at this in the clinical sample, but

36
00:02:13,696 --> 00:02:15,973
what you can see is if at one year, follow up.

37
00:02:15,973 --> 00:02:19,823
You said I primarily did it because my doctor warned me you are .5 times as

38
00:02:19,823 --> 00:02:23,450
likely as those who didn't check that reason to still be abstinent.

39
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:27,878
What that means is you are twice as likely to fail twice as likely to relapse.

40
00:02:27,878 --> 00:02:32,685
Now let's look at spouse warning .17 times as likely to be absent at the final

41
00:02:32,685 --> 00:02:37,300
follow up in the community sample that means six times more likely to relax.

42
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:42,252
If you originally did it just because your spouse pressure do Imagine if

43
00:02:42,252 --> 00:02:44,645
you're married to a physician and

44
00:02:44,645 --> 00:02:49,121
they tell you to do something how low that success rate would be.

45
00:02:49,121 --> 00:02:52,572
Now let's look at two more data points from this study the pros and

46
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:54,220
cons chart well in this study.

47
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:58,572
It was associated with higher failure rates .44 times in the community

48
00:02:58,572 --> 00:03:01,181
sample .4 times in the treatment sample.

49
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:04,599
Which means you were 60% less likely to Succinate or

50
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:07,240
2.2 times more likely to fail.

51
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:12,181
But to fully understand the output of this study, we have to look at the bottom

52
00:03:12,181 --> 00:03:15,846
row spiritual religious experience, 2.94 times.

53
00:03:15,846 --> 00:03:18,047
More likely in the community sample and

54
00:03:18,047 --> 00:03:22,391
2.4 times more likely in the clinical sample to be abstinent at follow up.

55
00:03:22,391 --> 00:03:24,244
So again it was protective so

56
00:03:24,244 --> 00:03:29,423
let's summarize there were three variables that predicted higher relapse and

57
00:03:29,423 --> 00:03:32,916
three variables that predicted continued absence.

58
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:37,776
Let's see if we can find a unifying theory to explain these findings let's start

59
00:03:37,776 --> 00:03:42,794
with the box on the left predicted Relapse what's common about doctor and spouse?

60
00:03:42,794 --> 00:03:46,024
External source you're doing it for someone else well,

61
00:03:46,024 --> 00:03:49,140
how do you synthesize that finding with pros and cons?

62
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:53,590
Well, it turns out most pros and cons charts function like an external source.

63
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:56,337
Most people populate their pros and cons,

64
00:03:56,337 --> 00:04:00,321
charts with external reasons what we say the usual suspects.

65
00:04:00,321 --> 00:04:03,444
Now, if you use a pros and cons chart more effectively and

66
00:04:03,444 --> 00:04:06,517
you ask the person to link it to their spiritual values.

67
00:04:06,517 --> 00:04:09,244
And you link it to more autonomous pathways of motivation,

68
00:04:09,244 --> 00:04:10,940
there very well could work.

69
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:15,943
But that's not simply how most pros and cons charts are implemented now let's take

70
00:04:15,943 --> 00:04:21,034
a look at predicted abstinence what's common to these three protective pathways?

71
00:04:21,034 --> 00:04:24,877
Well, it seems what's common to them is they are experiential they're

72
00:04:24,877 --> 00:04:26,140
irreversible.

73
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:29,068
Once they happen to you, can't ignore them or

74
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:32,157
argue yourself out of them a pros and cons start.

75
00:04:32,157 --> 00:04:37,539
You're always one pro or con away from tipping the scale but

76
00:04:37,539 --> 00:04:43,800
these largely major events are hard to simply argue yourself out of.

77
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,618
They leave an indelible mark now, clinically,

78
00:04:46,618 --> 00:04:49,994
we're not gonna ask people to hit someone with their car.

79
00:04:49,994 --> 00:04:54,040
We're not gonna lock someone up into jail we're not gonna fire them from their job.

80
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,914
So although they are very interesting and informative pathways,

81
00:04:57,914 --> 00:05:01,590
they don't have a tremendous amount of clinical importance.

82
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:06,424
Transformation appears to be the primary pathway through which works.

83
00:05:06,424 --> 00:05:10,374
In the previous slide, it implied that the transformation perhaps had to be religious

84
00:05:10,374 --> 00:05:13,340
it no way has to be religious you can be secular.

85
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:18,164
What a transformation means is you have an overwhelming sense that you've been

86
00:05:18,164 --> 00:05:20,257
put on earth to do something else.

87
00:05:20,257 --> 00:05:22,655
Something better, something bigger,

88
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:26,964
something more positive than this risk behavior in this study alcohol.

89
00:05:26,964 --> 00:05:31,576
But it can be true for any behavior those transformations can be

90
00:05:31,576 --> 00:05:36,805
extremely subtle in some cases, or they can be full blown epiphanies.

91
00:05:36,805 --> 00:05:41,157
But that is the pathway through which my often works a striking sense that I no

92
00:05:41,157 --> 00:05:44,140
longer want to do this behavior.

93
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:49,277
It's interesting that Pascal said it almost 400 years ago,

94
00:05:49,277 --> 00:05:53,461
we hope you've shown you the power of true intrinsic

95
00:05:53,461 --> 00:05:57,373
motivation of really doing something because.

96
00:05:57,373 --> 00:06:01,772
it's meaningful to you and also the harm of pressuring people,

97
00:06:01,772 --> 00:06:06,102
controlling people, guilting people into behavior change.

98
00:06:06,102 --> 00:06:11,630
It just doesn't work, be it a spouse or being a provider throughout the semester

99
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:16,351
will integrate these findings into our theoretical explanation for

100
00:06:16,351 --> 00:06:20,947
my as well as how we implement it clinically.
