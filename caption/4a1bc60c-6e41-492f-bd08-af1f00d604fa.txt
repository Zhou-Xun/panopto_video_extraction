1
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:08,430
All right. So my name is can win. And you are my name for an athlete you can listen to, too.

2
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:16,800
So my first question for you would be, why are you interested in this medical school in particular?

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,400
Sure. So I'll speak on western medicine.

4
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:29,639
So Western Western Medical School has a very interesting population based given that it's their school's campus is based out of Kalamazoo,

5
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:35,610
Michigan, which is predominantly a more rural area with some urban pieces to it.

6
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:46,880
So you have that diversity and patient population and therefore a unique set of experiences that people will come in,

7
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:52,860
you'll get your farm exposures, you'll get your industrial and construction work, your problem.

8
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:59,699
So it's just a wide array of medical situations that you're going to be exposed to that that kind

9
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:06,090
of diversity and patient population and reflection to the community is really interesting to me,

10
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:12,570
given that I have an interest in working with individuals who are potentially from underserved areas,

11
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:24,209
given the ethnic background, predominantly of migrant workers coming for the harvest season.

12
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:30,750
So in that area, you'll possibly get an opportunity to practice medical Spanish and understand

13
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:35,970
the cultural aspects of providing health care and that in that population.

14
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:44,730
So just thinking on your feet, working with diverse groups with a diverse population base is of great interest to me.

15
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:51,790
Right. What would you say are your strengths and weaknesses?

16
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:55,720
Sure. I'd say both my strengths and weaknesses come from teamwork.

17
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:04,480
I love working in teams. I love the idea that diverse problem solving techniques and approaches and perspectives

18
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:11,230
come together and try to create this one product that has this collaborative effect.

19
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,059
However, I actually have to speak more on the positive side.

20
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:18,430
Sorry. So speaking more into that,

21
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:29,620
I find myself really thriving in a teamwork role by engaging the group to yield the most amount of discussion from each member to make

22
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:38,380
sure that they're contributing and b that they're seeing the project come out the way that they envision so we can all build it together.

23
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:44,800
Now that comes at the weaknesses where I tend to in large groups, where I can trust that people are part of it.

24
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,319
I tend to use that team as a crutch where I might not participate as much as I would like to,

25
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,530
because maybe I have other things going on that are taking up my time.

26
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:58,990
So I'll kind of rely on the other members of the team to fill in my part.

27
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:02,890
So that's something I'm working on by, um,

28
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:10,840
by setting standards and making sure that everybody is on the same page at the start of the project of what the clear expectations are from each

29
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:19,510
member of what piece they're going to contribute and how we're going to come together during meetings at set times to collaborate in that respect.

30
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:24,970
So there is both an individual and a team component to it with everybody taking on that equal share.

31
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:31,800
All right. Well, every year we get many applications.

32
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:36,659
What sets you apart from other medical school applicants?

33
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:40,350
And why should we expect you to ask me in particular? Sure.

34
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:47,310
One of my favorite aspects about my path to medicine is that I took an environmental health route.

35
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:51,930
A lot of people will take pre-med, just taking my biology or chemistry route.

36
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:57,580
I like to come at it of the perspective of taking a holistic approach to understanding exposures,

37
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:02,879
to understanding the root cause of your health outcome and what treatment plans are

38
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:09,090
feasible to accommodate and treat that the issue you're coming into the clinic with.

39
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:15,030
And this remind me the second half of that question, please.

40
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,580
I want to say. Okay. Yeah.

41
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:27,060
The first half was just a sensible pardon. Sure. The other half.

42
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:31,250
It's a why. This medical school in particular? Sure.

43
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:38,990
Why this medical school? Because you it again, speaking to that diversity and patient population and that thinking on your feet.

44
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:47,470
Necessity of just coming from an unfamiliar approach will lead to a well.

45
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:56,780
It helped my ability to once again think on my feet and to apply what I've learned from an environmental health standpoint and to a medical

46
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:08,540
science standpoint so I can apply these solutions while understanding the root cause in an interesting or in a in a different way.

47
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:12,140
Thank you.
