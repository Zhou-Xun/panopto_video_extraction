1
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:08,570
I'm gonna take my time. I don't want.

2
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:26,900
It's like a tractor shoot out of the house.

3
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:33,950
So she's going, Oh, [INAUDIBLE]. Oh, [INAUDIBLE]. So she's like, She's got.

4
00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:06,690
Okay. Thank you. The Special Student presentation for today.

5
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:10,620
I didn't even think about that.

6
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:15,830
I was just like schedule it when I thought they would fit in substantively as opposed to like, Oh, we can't do one Thanksgiving.

7
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:23,420
We look at my essay.

8
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:28,940
All right, so I saw this yesterday. It kind of cracked me up to play it for him.

9
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:35,770
I didn't see you there. I was just making a generous donation to charity.

10
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:42,520
Oh, I didn't see you there. I was just making a generous donation to charities.

11
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:52,180
Hi. I'm the CEO of UnitedHealthcare. The holidays are just around the corner, and it's a time filled with family fun and yes, health care.

12
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:59,590
United Healthcare has done a lot over this year to make sure you stay healthy and collect your premiums.

13
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:08,950
Christmas is coming. Maybe you've met your deductible for your out-of-pocket maximum for the year and are thinking about having a knee replacement,

14
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:12,400
cataract surgery or sudden catastrophic illness.

15
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:18,540
Well, I'm here to tell you. Wait till January, please.

16
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,130
There's nothing to do in January. And it's cold and dark.

17
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:25,570
It's the best time for expensive health care needs.

18
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:33,160
So when you go in for that next appointment, tell your doctor you want to wait until January 1st for that brain tumor resection

19
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:38,380
and that baby in there just a few more weeks so we can all share the joy,

20
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:42,040
love and exorbitant costs of health care in this great country.

21
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:48,130
Don't end up on Santas Anonymous. Wait until January to have that emergent cardiac bypass.

22
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,180
Here are a few other reasons why health care is better after the first of the year.

23
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:55,990
Did you know that all hospitals closed down after Thanksgiving?

24
00:02:56,290 --> 00:03:02,650
Probably your body knows that January is the best month to have elective surgery and will heal itself accordingly.

25
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:06,880
The mortality rate for everything in December is 1,000%.

26
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:14,590
All doctors are drunk in December. Seriously, do you want a drunk doctor performing emergency surgery on your burst appendix?

27
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:19,360
No, thank you. I'll wait till January 1st. Happy holidays.

28
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:28,350
So given that today's topic is health care costs, I thought that was appropriate.

29
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:35,720
And also given today's topic is health care costs. Some of these showed up in The New York Times last week.

30
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:38,760
I'll read the quote, which is very germane.

31
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:47,700
A high profile report noted that the costs of health care were leading to personal bankruptcies, loss of homes and people going without needed care.

32
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:54,330
That report also concluded that the key problem was, quote, not the system but the lack of a system to organize care.

33
00:03:55,290 --> 00:04:07,860
Great to remain for today's topic on health care costs. As I say, I was in last week's New York Times written in 1932, so not much has changed.

34
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:13,830
Anybody doubt me? When I said that was in last week's New York Times? It was like he's pulling one over on us.

35
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:21,239
It's Monday morning. He's trying to now. It sounds like it could have been right at that time.

36
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,719
Health care spending was less than 4% of gross domestic product.

37
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,560
Now it's about 18%. And plus it's 18% of a much bigger gross domestic product.

38
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:37,350
So if you think of the absolute increase, it's a lot larger than that in 4% of a very small pie or 18% of a very large pie.

39
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:42,900
That 18% of a large pie is a lot bigger than the 4% of the small pie.

40
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,540
So health care spending is sort of catnip to health economists.

41
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:53,710
So that interesting lecture, I hope.

42
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:02,409
Okay. So here's the graph that everybody has to show you. It was the US.

43
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:07,280
We've got income per capita income on this axis. We've got health care spending on that axis.

44
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:12,620
We see that health care tends to be, what, a normal good or an inferior good from this graph.

45
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:20,330
Normal good, because as income goes up, health spending goes up.

46
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:25,910
So each state as a country and see higher income countries, not surprisingly, spend more on health care.

47
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:38,770
But there's a general trend line. Whereas the US where we were kind of the ones that were pulling that trend line up.

48
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:47,980
And so basically we would be a pretty high spending healthcare I healthcare spending country just on the basis of our income.

49
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:55,470
But if we followed sort of the general international trend in terms of income relative to

50
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,910
health care spending would have to come all the way down there to get the trend line.

51
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:07,480
You know, so it's not surprising that we spend a lot on health care because we're one of the richest countries in terms of per capita income,

52
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:17,620
but we're a huge outlier from even that trend. Okay, so why is U.S. health care spending so high?

53
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:23,440
So definition spending is price times quantity.

54
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,040
So one way of rephrasing that question is which one is it?

55
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:30,100
Is it price as a quantity or is it some combination of both?

56
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:41,650
Both economists, who they Reinhart from Princeton were taken in 2003 titled It's the Price of Stupid.

57
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:49,870
And then his colleagues rewrote that paper, got read it of new analyzes in 2019 including it's still the price is Stupid.

58
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:57,790
The U.S. has fewer physicians, nurses and hospital beds per capita than the OECD average.

59
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:02,500
So at least on those metrics, it doesn't seem like maybe we're using a whole lot more care.

60
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:09,550
We do have a lot more technology particular in things measurable things like fly scan or CT scanners.

61
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:14,470
So we do maybe use more imaging tests in certain types of procedures.

62
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:19,000
But in terms of some of the big picture things, how many doctors do we have? How many nurses do we have?

63
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,270
How many hospital beds do we have? We're not outliers in that.

64
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:28,179
So at least gives us some indication that the explanation for why we're spending so much isn't just,

65
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:31,760
well, we're using a lot more care than everybody else is.

66
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:38,890
Our capacity for those certain metrics like labor force are not is not greater per capita than other countries.

67
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:44,069
But now take a look at prices so we can take a look at prices in a number of ways,

68
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:47,800
sort of input prices for general physicians, learn how extra nurses are.

69
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:52,870
So U.S. physicians are an average of 316,000.

70
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:59,830
The second highest is Germany and there are about 40% less and they're the second highest.

71
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:05,070
We also have a higher ratio of specialty income compared to primary care income.

72
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:12,730
Most countries specialists earn maybe a 25% or so premium on average over primary care docs, maybe a little more.

73
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:23,880
U.S. That premium is a lot higher. Hospital based nurse salaries in the US are 38% higher than the OECD median or OECD just.

74
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:31,900
They're basically a kind of data collection group of made up primarily of higher income countries, sort of middle to higher income countries.

75
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:37,030
So about 30%, 38% higher than median drug spending.

76
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:42,220
Probably not surprising. We spend a lot there, the highest costs for prescription drugs.

77
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:48,790
So on a per capita basis, our drug spending is about $1,000, about double the OECD median.

78
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:52,930
And why is there that difference? It's mainly driven by prices paid for brand name drugs.

79
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:57,280
Not that we're getting so many more drugs than other countries. That doesn't seem to be quantity.

80
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:10,740
That's driven by differences in price. Hospital costs us spending per hospital discharge is double the OECD median double almost to the dollar.

81
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:16,879
It's really kind of pretty amazing if you double if you double listed at 21,060.

82
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:23,180
So we're $3 off double the median. So prices is a big deal.

83
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:29,870
Now, those are all prices of either of services like per hospital discharge or prices of inputs.

84
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:37,790
How much is a physician or a neurosurgeon in Europe is actually a different way we can look at prices and in that different conceptualization,

85
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:44,630
some health care prices have actually fallen dramatically over time, sort of thinking of the price of delivering a service.

86
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:50,710
Let's think about the price of attaining an outcomes. So here's an example.

87
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,130
Hodgkin's lymphoma in 1950 was uniformly fatal.

88
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:58,700
There was no effective treatment available for it, 100% mortality rate.

89
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:02,450
So the price of care of delivered for those things,

90
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:07,100
the price of service was probably pretty low because there wasn't much that could be done other than some palliative care.

91
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:12,230
So treating Hodgkin's lymphoma in 1950 was probably pretty darn cheap.

92
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:19,850
There's nothing we can do for you. Well, we don't have to spend a lot, but the price of curing it was effectively infinity.

93
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:26,190
It was an incurable disease. Therefore we couldn't cure it at any finite price.

94
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:33,870
Then we developed radiation therapy and chemotherapies that treated Hodgkin's lymphoma very, very effectively.

95
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:41,759
So now if you think about the price of services, it's gone up because we're spending a lot of money on that radiation therapy,

96
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,440
that chemotherapy that we weren't spending in 1950 when those things didn't exist.

97
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:55,310
So the service price has risen, but the price of curing Hodgkin's disease has fallen from infinity to, say, $50,000.

98
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:05,489
So if we kind of flip our perspective on what we mean by price and say, well, even though the price of services is high,

99
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:10,260
the price of a cure actually has gone down because so much more effective treatment is available.

100
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:15,210
So if we think about it that way, we got to a price here, the price here.

101
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:19,290
But now in terms of spending, our spending is a lot higher at the lower price.

102
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:23,460
And there is no cure available. We weren't spending anything on trying to cure it.

103
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:33,340
But I make sense in terms of the sort of conceptual flip, in terms of what we mean by price for thinking about spending.

104
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:38,739
It's really the price of services, the price of the inputs that go into the price of those services that matter.

105
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:42,940
All those things are very high. What they're my relative to other countries.

106
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:46,959
We're going to see some data later showing they've also risen quite a bit over time in the

107
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:53,830
US because something like the price of curing a condition as we have technical progress,

108
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:58,450
that price could actually decline even as that causes our spending to go way up.

109
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,580
Not spending really anything on curing Hodgkin's disease in 1950 because there was nothing we could do.

110
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:14,440
I'm particularly pleased by this because when I was in grad school as diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease, fortunately as old as I am, it was 1950 that.

111
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:23,480
So you still here? And so we saw it first graph that.

112
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:29,990
So we're really an outlier on health care spending. And there's another metric where we're not really an outlier.

113
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:39,500
We're sort of right in the middle. Let's do the sum of health care spending and social service spending as a percent of gross domestic product.

114
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:45,500
Okay. So the brown the bottom part is health care's contribution.

115
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:50,899
Yellow is social service spending. So we could be housing subsidies.

116
00:12:50,900 --> 00:13:02,060
It could be. I think there are some public health programs that term or what all categories aren't for sure and have looked at this paper recently.

117
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:09,420
As a waiter and fill you in on what the exact categories are.

118
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:14,820
But it's basically, you know, all the services that might influence health and public education is in it.

119
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:20,010
They're all in. So all services that have been shown to influence health, improve people's housing,

120
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:26,050
that they wouldn't support a sentence that would be once in the US SNAP program would be at all

121
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:31,710
things that are shown to improve health at the population level but are not health care directly.

122
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,509
So when you add that up with health care, we are right in the middle.

123
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:42,540
We spend a sort of a normal amount, but we're incredibly different in our distribution of that spending.

124
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:51,100
So we spent almost 2 to 1 health care relative to those social services.

125
00:13:51,520 --> 00:14:00,010
And most other countries spend, if not quite 2 to 1, certainly like 1 to 1, one and a half to one in the other direction.

126
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:02,840
You know,

127
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:09,440
if you think about those other services are all things I said that have been shown to improve health at the population status at the population level.

128
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:17,750
So one of the explanations potentially for story you hear a lot while we spend more on health care than anybody else,

129
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:26,850
but we don't have better outcomes. And part of the reason is we spend less on other things that also improve health and then we take it on net.

130
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:38,290
Then we have kind of middling outcomes. He began with the usual proviso that correlation is not causation.

131
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:46,250
Here's a study that looked at the state level variations between social service spending relative to health spending and health outcomes.

132
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:51,010
So that sort of ratio of your spending a greater amount in social services relative to health care.

133
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:58,100
Where are your outcomes? And it turns out that it's very similar.

134
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:01,910
So is that ratio of social service to health spending.

135
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:08,420
So the green countries spend relatively more or states spend relatively more on social services compared to health care.

136
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:12,770
The Reds spend relatively more on health care relative to social services.

137
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,470
And here we've got three different measures of outcomes.

138
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:23,420
The other 3% of the population that's obese, percent of adults reporting 14 or more days in the last 30 years.

139
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:28,280
Mentally unhealthy days. And lung cancer mortality per 100,000 population.

140
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:35,210
So, again, they're not every measure of health status, but they're sort of three disparate measures not to kind of measuring the same thing.

141
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:39,710
And you can lay those graphs on top of each other pretty closely.

142
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:49,400
Again, correlation does not imply causation, but at least some suggestive evidence that maybe this kind of different mix that we take might be part

143
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:54,860
of the explanation for why do we spend so much on health care and we don't have the best outcomes?

144
00:15:55,730 --> 00:16:01,250
Well, health care, we talked about the production function. Was health care the only input in the health production function?

145
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:09,660
There's tons of inputs. So we spend more on health care that input, but we spend less on other inputs.

146
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:18,379
Plus, as we saw, one of the reasons we spend so much on health care isn't because we're getting more of it.

147
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:20,190
It's because we're just paying higher prices.

148
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:27,450
So if the higher spending is reflected mostly higher prices, then that doesn't mean we're necessarily going to get better outcomes.

149
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:36,270
And so let's look at health expenditure growth over time. If we go way back, this graph goes back to 1990.

150
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:46,229
If we took this back to 1940, like I said, we had sort of 3 to 4% of GDP on health care in 1948 as a 4% in 1944.

151
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:50,580
1932. Well, that I said it was a little closer to 3%.

152
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:58,400
So health care spending has been rising gradually. For a long, long, long time.

153
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:03,640
As our income has grown like that graph showed, we'd expect it to grow.

154
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:11,450
We'd expect as we got richer over these decades as a country, we would spend more of our GDP, a greater share of our GDP on ealth care.

155
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:15,400
That's simply to saying that health care is a normal, good health care.

156
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:22,640
In this case, at the national level, sort of a luxury to us, but not only a greater absolute amount, but also a greater relative amount as well.

157
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:29,980
So we don't see that trend since 1990. The gray areas are just times of recession.

158
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:34,089
See, health care has often been at least somewhat recession resistant.

159
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:40,910
So you'll see that health care spending had a thumbs up during recessions because the rest of the economy goes down.

160
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:46,210
Health care usually is only moderately affected or just keeps chugging along as if nothing happened.

161
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:54,110
And then, of course, the data get all messed up by holding. You have this class.

162
00:17:54,140 --> 00:18:04,110
Three years ago, everything would've been a nice, smooth trend. So let's look at the opportunity cost of health care.

163
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:11,780
So opportunity cost as well. What could we have produced had we not used these resources in health care?

164
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:17,419
Has that opportunity costs been growing over time? And the answer, at least on this one metric, seems to be yes.

165
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:20,840
Health care is consuming a greater share of the labor force over time.

166
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:24,920
So it's not just prices. There are other things going on as well.

167
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:29,720
We're also drawing more people into health care and out of whatever else they could have done.

168
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:33,380
So if you think of it from a societal resource allocation perspective,

169
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:40,640
if we take twice as many people out of the workforce to move into health care, they're not working those other jobs that they would have worked.

170
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:46,940
So as a society, what we're giving up is what those people could have produced in their next best occupation.

171
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:52,820
And we see about one percentage point increase in the labor force devoted to health care per eight years.

172
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,560
Again, so the recession sort of kind of ride that out.

173
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:04,100
During recessions, employment everywhere else goes down. So the share in relative to health care.

174
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:09,080
So health care goes up. So if you kind of smooth this out, it's about 1% per eight years,

175
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:15,650
but it's a little bumpy because of recessions and then obviously because of COVID, where temporarily it went up.

176
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:22,250
And now we're just we've literally just gotten back to where we were pre-COVID in terms of percent of labor force at health care.

177
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:27,649
It went up quite dramatically. And then it's been sort of pretty gradually declining.

178
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:31,430
And it's a slow pull to too little data to be absolutely sure.

179
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:35,600
But it looks like it's sort of bottomed out and just kind of started to take back up.

180
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:40,940
And it's right about the level it was just before. And then it started.

181
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:50,040
And so why is U.S. health care spending growing so rapidly?

182
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:55,810
It's a little bit of a different question or we kind of tried to answer so far is why do we spend so much?

183
00:19:55,830 --> 00:20:02,370
That's kind of a point in time. Question. In 2022, why do we spend 18% of our GDP on health care?

184
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:09,360
Switzerland spends 11 or 12% or like number two, and the average OECD countries maybe around 9%.

185
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:14,250
That's sort of a point in time. Question. We also ask the question over time, why?

186
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:20,700
Why is spending growing so rapidly over time? That's a sort of 4% to 8% of GDP question.

187
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:26,100
So explaining growth requires us to ask what has changed?

188
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:31,530
What factors have changed over time? So what are some of the things you might guess?

189
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:38,100
What, and why are we spending more today on health care than we did ten, 20, 30, 50 years ago?

190
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:44,470
What's changed? Advanced technology. You took.

191
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:55,300
So the Hodgkin's disease example is just one of those. In 1950, we didn't have chemotherapy and radiation to treat Hodgkin's disease.

192
00:20:55,720 --> 00:21:06,440
Now we do. And so research in that can kind of be sort of maybe the source of the new technology.

193
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:13,580
So if we spend a lot on research, say we have big NIH budgets.

194
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:22,640
And drug companies and device manufacturers also spend a lot of their own money on research that's going to generate the new technology.

195
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:30,830
Yeah, changes in the reimbursement structure. So obviously expansion of or the creation of Medicare and Medicaid.

196
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:36,020
Exactly. Okay. So we've got this spread of insurance.

197
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:43,880
Okay. 1930s where I gave you that first quote. Basically, nobody had health insurance.

198
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:54,919
Health care was either paid out of pocket or it was charity. Health insurance kind of really came to the forefront in the 1940s in the employer

199
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:59,660
market through the wage and price controls in World War Two that exempted benefits.

200
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:07,580
So firms to compete for labor said, well, I can't I'm not allowed to raise wages to compete for labor, but I can offer benefits.

201
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:11,600
So that's how we got our insurance tied to employment.

202
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:19,860
Now. That's still where we are because of essentially that historical accident of 1940 policy.

203
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:29,510
And suppose I gave you all a blank sheet of paper? Right now it's a design, a health care financing system for the United States.

204
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:34,880
And you don't have to tell me how you get from where we are today to what you've designed.

205
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:44,240
It's a clean sheet. You can start from scratch. You do not have to, you know, say, well, currently we have employer based insurance.

206
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:50,149
So therefore, to get to where I want, I have to deal with the reality of how do you get people to say,

207
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:56,570
I'm going to give up the employer based system for some unknown future thing on your clean sheet of paper or you don't have.

208
00:22:56,630 --> 00:23:02,840
You're not constrained by that historical accident. How many of you would write tie health insurance to your job?

209
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:10,610
Anybody. I didn't think so.

210
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:15,799
Yet here we are. Yes. And so what else has changed?

211
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:23,390
So this is a great one. So 1940s, we start getting employer market, 1965, Medicare and Medicaid are passed.

212
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:30,740
Prior to 1965, about 30 to 40% of the over 65 population had no insurance at all.

213
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:35,120
That's the highest health care using age group in the population, obviously.

214
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:41,720
And once they lost their employer employment based policies, a lot of them had no coverage.

215
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:46,760
Okay. Lower income people without employer based coverage had nothing for Medicaid.

216
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:52,580
And obviously, we got the ACA and the exchanges and the Medicaid expansions in most states.

217
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,320
So gradually over time, the percent paid out of pocket has gone down dramatically.

218
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:02,570
So what does that do to people's incentives? So more care.

219
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:07,510
Okay. All right. So there's another one for other reasons.

220
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,550
What else has changed that might influence health care spending over time?

221
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:18,680
Your medications and the idea that you can patent like a molecule or like a class of medications.

222
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:22,969
Okay. So it's kind of also in sort of very broadly put that new technology.

223
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:28,040
So you've got new new medications and you've got patents and the ability that drug companies of corporate colors

224
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:35,690
of extending patents and getting add on patents that probably were not on the radar screen 50 years ago.

225
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,220
It's like, Oh, I could do the extended release version and get a whole new patent.

226
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:51,100
I think it would go under insurance, but I was thinking about new discovered disease like around the years.

227
00:24:51,400 --> 00:25:01,720
Every time we would find a new disease. So I'm not sure if it really features so a new disease or medicalizing things that always existed.

228
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:07,120
So it is it could be a truly new disease that was discovered, but maybe even more important would be.

229
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:13,400
So osteoporosis is an example. So osteoporosis is sort of a defined thing.

230
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:19,270
But now we have something called what? What's short of osteoporosis?

231
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:32,850
Osteopenia. Osteopenia did not exist. Now, that doesn't mean that people didn't have thinning bones that really go in the path that always existed.

232
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:39,690
But we didn't have a name for it and we didn't get a name for it until we had a drug that could treat it.

233
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:46,170
So it's that kind of yes. In someone else, you have a drug that can treat it.

234
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:55,860
It's like, Oh, we got a whole new condition that we can medicalized. And it turns out that that drug was proven effective for osteoporosis.

235
00:25:56,670 --> 00:26:02,640
It wasn't really proven effective for us in osteopenia and created a lot of controversy.

236
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:10,010
So what else has changed? Prevalence of chronic disease and obesity.

237
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:24,880
Okay. So obesity is way up. Diabetes is way up, kidney disease is way up.

238
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:32,680
It turns out cardiovascular disease is actually down over time because statins are so effective and because we stopped smoking.

239
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:38,780
But a lot of other things have gone up. Yes. Right.

240
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:48,010
What else is different about the population? What the population is is growing again.

241
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:57,520
So more people. And so that probably wouldn't change per capita spending, but would change total spending.

242
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:02,650
So forcing thing things that would affect per capita spending, which is the average person spend.

243
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:12,260
It's one. Yep. Aging population.

244
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:16,829
That's. Okay.

245
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:19,980
So we're on average a lot older now than we were in 1940.

246
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:29,250
So given that there is a clear relationship here in age, in health care spending, given that we don't have this sort of fixed demographic population,

247
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:33,630
we've got demographics moving to older groups, that's going to also increase spending.

248
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:38,430
Okay. So that's a lot of the potential candidates. And of course, prices might be going up.

249
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:47,370
You know, there are a few other things that we'll see, but those are a lot of the big ones.

250
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:54,330
Iran will consider a two time period or kind of a set of studies that looked at

251
00:27:54,330 --> 00:28:00,510
health care spending growth and and what explained it from 1940 to the mid 1990s.

252
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:07,740
And there's a couple more recent studies I'll show you that kind of cover the period from the mid-nineties until about 2016.

253
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:19,090
Okay. So between 1940 and this is probably the study was in 2000, I think their data probably went to around 97 or so.

254
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:29,250
There was about a 500% increase in health spending. And then that 1% of that total increase was explained by these different factors.

255
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:33,390
So what they looked at for their use is what they called the exclusionary approach.

256
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:38,010
There are some things we can readily measure and we know how they affect health care spending.

257
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:44,280
So we can measure how much older the population is in 1997 than it was in 1940.

258
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:47,880
And we know the relationship between age and health care spending.

259
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:55,440
So we can sort of answer the question, you know, if the pot because the population aged as much as it did,

260
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:59,670
how much would that factor by itself have increased health care spending?

261
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:06,270
And they could do about this for a bunch of different things they can kind of measure and project and say,

262
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:10,920
well, if this had happened, what percent of that total 500% growth was explained?

263
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:16,410
And then they run out of things they can easily measure and they say, well, how much is left over?

264
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:21,660
If we if we then explained 100% of health care spending growth, okay, then we're done.

265
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:29,820
If we haven't explained 100%, then we have to sort of hypothesize what might be driving the part that we haven't explained by these named factors.

266
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:37,580
Okay, so population aging turned out not to be that big to explain about 2% of the spending growth.

267
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:42,330
So about a 10% increase or is 500% growth? 2% of that is about 10%.

268
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:50,970
So it explains something but pretty little. So there was yes, it mattered, but it wasn't a dominant factor.

269
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:57,270
Okay. Increase in third party payment. And that was a bigger one.

270
00:29:57,930 --> 00:30:05,790
So we know from the Rand study and other evidence roughly what the price elasticity of demand for medical care is.

271
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:07,260
So we can say, you know,

272
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:15,390
how much the growth of health insurance has decreased the out-of-pocket price and therefore how much it is increased use of care.

273
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:23,670
And that's about 10% of the total. So about a 50% of that 500% was explained by the growth of insurance.

274
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:29,750
So that's a little more important in this time period than aging. And then we had if we jump all the way back to.

275
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:37,640
Our first graph we see in that international comparison, the higher income countries spend more on health care.

276
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:41,690
We know that the income elasticity of demand for health care is positive.

277
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:51,620
So as our incomes have grown over this time period from 1940 to late 1990s, just the fact that we're richer and health care is a normal good.

278
00:30:51,980 --> 00:31:01,580
Knowing what we know about the income elasticity of demand for medical care that explains about the richer,

279
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:05,240
explains about 11 to 18% of the spending growth.

280
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:13,819
Health care prices. So growth in health care prices relative to general price growth in the economy and I think is

281
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:18,490
this like excessive growth of health care prices relative to the general rate of inflation?

282
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:24,230
That explains sort of between 11 and 22% of spending increases during this time period.

283
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:31,820
Growth in administrative costs explains something not as much, but 3 to 10%.

284
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:40,100
And this is a one that always stuns physicians. Defensive medicine and supplier induced demand.

285
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:45,290
What you do in response to being worried about getting sued explains none of the growth.

286
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:52,610
Now, that doesn't mean that a point in time that doesn't exist. It doesn't mean it might not explain the level of spending,

287
00:31:52,970 --> 00:32:01,040
but just it does it hasn't changed enough over time to be a significant factor in explaining why we spend more today than yesterday,

288
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,680
because, in fact, medical malpractice pressure is cyclical. It's not always going up.

289
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:11,690
Cases go up, cases go down, settlement rates go up, settlement rates go down.

290
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:17,840
When cases and rate and settlements go up and costs go up, then states enact reforms to limit.

291
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:26,450
Things like statutes of limitations to limit maximum verdicts, limit how much can be given for pain and suffering,

292
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:31,100
then that causes cases and malpractice insurance, everything to come down.

293
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:35,480
So it tends to be cyclical rather than a uniform upward.

294
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:39,140
Yeah, the population is getting older pretty much every year.

295
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:40,820
That's pretty uniform.

296
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:46,310
It's not like we got older for ten years and we got younger for ten years and we got older for ten years and got younger for ten years.

297
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:52,910
Malpractice is more like this. So it doesn't really explain growth and spending.

298
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:59,430
Okay. Well, we have all that stuff up. Let's take the middle of that range of unexplained.

299
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:06,790
It is exactly 50%. So basically all this stuff that could be readily quantified explains half, which is pretty good.

300
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:11,150
We understand half of why health care spending has grown over the decades.

301
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:17,030
Understanding half is a lot better than saying none. But what about the other half?

302
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:23,659
So what's here that didn't really show up in that in the in the list of things that were sort of enumerated.

303
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:31,819
And we put numbers to. It's a big thing there that's talked about a lot as we go through it.

304
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:35,990
Reasons research. So all this stuff.

305
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:45,590
Exactly you technology. So I got to define new technology very broadly as just new knowledge, new stuff we can do.

306
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:50,080
Sometimes new technology is embodied in a machine like an MRI scanner.

307
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:54,770
Sometimes it's embodied in a drug or a biologic or a surgical instrument.

308
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:59,870
Other times, it's just knowledge. What causes most?

309
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:11,540
Ulcers. Stomach ulcers. Bacteria so it could be treated.

310
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,659
Antibiotics. That was brand new knowledge.

311
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:25,270
In the 1980s, antibiotics existed, but it wasn't known that they caused stomach ulcers.

312
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:31,990
So we didn't treat people who were developing symptoms of stomach ulcers with antibiotics.

313
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:43,020
So that was just new knowledge. In fact, a gastroenterologist from Australia named Barry Marshall had this hypothesis and everybody said he was crazy.

314
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:48,910
So the acid in the stomach is so great that no bacteria could possibly live in the stomach.

315
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:59,280
So what he did is he isolated the bacteria he thought was a cause, and then he drank a beaker of beaker of solution with it.

316
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:02,730
And sure enough, he started developing symptoms.

317
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:08,310
So he self experimented because everybody said he was crazy.

318
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:13,980
Now maybe that maybe it does imply he was crazy, but he can be crazy and right.

319
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:19,950
So he is crazy and right. People want why he was crazy and wrong.

320
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:26,400
He was crazy, but he was right. Okay.

321
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:32,610
So the other half, I think, likely is dominated by changing medical technology.

322
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:37,680
Again, oftentimes embodied in a piece of machinery or a drug.

323
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:42,840
But generally just think of it as new knowledge and capabilities that change treatment patterns.

324
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:48,570
There's stuff we know now, and there's stuff we can do now that we didn't know and we couldn't do in the past.

325
00:35:51,290 --> 00:35:54,080
But that might lead to a question why does technology.

326
00:35:57,610 --> 00:36:03,810
Expanding and pure look at some of the more recent data, and then we'll kind of think about that question a little more deeply.

327
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:12,880
Okay. So here's a paper from JAMA in 2017 that looked at spending growth from 1996 to 2013.

328
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:18,670
And there was almost perfectly taking up at the point of time where the last chart I showed you had it.

329
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:21,370
Their data ended in the late 1980s.

330
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:33,430
So we had more people that explained about 23% of the growth from 1996 to 20 to 2013, just that the population is bigger.

331
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:39,700
Now let's set that aside and say we're more interested in trying to understand per capita spending.

332
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:43,200
You know, if we had more people were spend more on health care. Yeah.

333
00:36:44,810 --> 00:36:50,200
Who cares? What's being more interesting is how much we spend per person.

334
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:59,440
So basically it's 77% of health spending growth was per person growth 20 or as if nothing else had changed and we just had a bigger population,

335
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:08,530
we would spend 23% more on health care. So that would explain the 23% of the growth of spending that we saw in this time of year for health care.

336
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:17,080
It's a little under a quarter is just simply was there more of us? So let's consider the 77% that isn't explained by the fact there's more of us.

337
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:26,530
It's more on a per capita level. So the rest of these numbers, you just sort of divide them all by point seven, seven in a way to scale them up.

338
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:33,790
So age distribution explained in this case much more than the earlier time period was only about 2% of spending.

339
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:42,550
Growth in this case is 11.6. But in our per capita basis, we may be more like 15% of the per capita spending increase.

340
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:48,820
So aging of the population did matter. It, maybe surprisingly,

341
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:59,740
is disease incidence and prevalence actually contributed on net to a slight decline and that's because of what I sort of mentioned.

342
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:07,840
There are some things that have really gone up diabetes, kidney disease, but particularly for cardiovascular disease, there were big improvements.

343
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:12,310
We have statins that very effectively keep people from having heart attacks.

344
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:18,220
And a big factor is the public health programs that decrease smoking rates dramatically.

345
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:27,000
So then that made lung cancer rates go down or cardiovascular disease go way down.

346
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:32,820
So on net, actually, it isn't that we're kind of a sicker population.

347
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:34,379
There are certainly individual factors.

348
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:40,980
Diabetes growth may cost spending go up, but cardiovascular spending went down based on prevalence of conditions.

349
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:51,670
Encounters per case, are we kind of just doing more stuff, like more office visits per case, more hospitalizations per case?

350
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:55,720
No, we're not really doing more stuff. So we go back to the price times quantity.

351
00:38:56,230 --> 00:39:00,100
That's kind of like saying, well, the Q isn't really a big factor.

352
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:06,690
You're spending growth. So what's left over?

353
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:12,090
So instead of calling it sort of technology, they call it price and intensity per encounter.

354
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:18,210
So they didn't explicitly measure prices. And intensity is sort of like the mix of things we're doing is changing.

355
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:25,020
So the encounters per case that say we've got office visits, so are we doing three office visits rather than two?

356
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,930
No, we're not. We're still doing basically two office visits.

357
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:34,469
In fact, if anything, it's slightly declining because hospitalization rates are declining, outpatient use is going up.

358
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:40,860
But our price weighted average that that has been really a decline in encounters because of

359
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:45,990
the outpatient increase has not sort of completely offset the decrease in hospitalizations.

360
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:56,280
But we're doing a different mix of things. That intensity might be, well, now we're treating you with chemotherapy drug that didn't exist in 1996.

361
00:39:57,180 --> 00:40:01,020
Now we're doing more have more MRI's that didn't exist.

362
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:07,940
Weren't used for that condition. So it's more the intensity of the mix of services is going up and the price.

363
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:15,580
So it's sort of price and technology explains 50% of the growth and almost two thirds then of the per capita growth.

364
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:19,090
Once we saw a drop out, that population growth at 23%.

365
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:22,660
So it's 50% of the remaining 77%.

366
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:33,620
They did a follow up study in 2020 that asked a slightly different question.

367
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:40,850
Since it was 2020, they're able to get three years of newer data. So they looked at the two decades from 96 to 2016.

368
00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:46,730
What were the clinical conditions that were driving spending changes over this time period?

369
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:53,920
Their top three lower back and neck pain, other musculoskeletal conditions and diabetes.

370
00:40:55,240 --> 00:41:00,100
The lower back and neck pain is particularly interesting. Was it driven by case growth?

371
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:03,700
Not really. The case growth was only 1.1% a year.

372
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:08,620
So the case growth explained only about a sixth of the spending growth.

373
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:15,670
And it was also, despite efforts over this time period to say, you know, hey,

374
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:20,040
this kind of low value care to send somebody with lower back pain for an hour.

375
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:24,100
I right away before you've tried conservative treatment, don't do that.

376
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:32,409
So despite that and despite sort of a lack of data showing that kind of more aggressive therapies like surgery

377
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:39,130
are necessarily better than less aggressive therapies like physical therapy or medical or medication treatment.

378
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:45,910
So it was a little bit of a a puzzling one because it's not obvious that it should

379
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:52,450
have gone up that much money and diabetes and dementias rose substantially.

380
00:41:52,780 --> 00:42:00,580
And in both cases, case growth was important. So, yes, I think it's more prevalent and dementia rates have gone up.

381
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:04,600
In the case of diabetes, drug costs were also a big factor.

382
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:11,260
So case growth were more important for both. Dementia was driven almost primarily, almost all by case growth.

383
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:13,810
Diabetes was driven by case growth and drug cost.

384
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:23,020
Some other conditions that are particularly high spending growth were hepatitis, arthritis and multiple sclerosis.

385
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:29,680
And they shared one thing in common. Each of them had a new, expensive specialty drug that was developed during this time period.

386
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:37,810
So is the development of the drug then and now go back to the Hodgkin's disease example.

387
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:42,850
The price of care for those these conditions went way up because of these drugs.

388
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:48,680
The price of achieving an outcome probably went down. We can now cure hepatitis.

389
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:55,000
It's an $80,000 drug, but it's a lifetime cure.

390
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:04,560
EMS we can't cure yet, but at the beginning of this time period, there was very little we could do to even slow its progression.

391
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:12,150
Now we have some drugs that can only slow the progression. So the price of cure is still infinity, in a sense,

392
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:19,800
but the price of at least some improvement has dropped because now at some high cost, we can improve your trajectory on that condition.

393
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:24,030
Used to be that we couldn't prove victory at any cost whatsoever.

394
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:32,250
There was nothing effective available. So these are things where the cost of achieving an outcome may have gone down dramatically.

395
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:41,460
But because of that new technology, the spending went way up. So why does technology drive up spending?

396
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:50,080
I'm going to reveal roughly how old I am here. In the first PC that I bought, I spent 20 $500 for.

397
00:43:50,790 --> 00:43:55,650
That was in 1988. What do you think? 2519 $88 would be equivalent to today.

398
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:07,080
Probably about $6,000 or so. So if inflation just, what, 20 $500 meant to me in 1988, revolver, $6,000 means to you today.

399
00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:11,160
That got a 45 megabyte hard drive, which was massive.

400
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:21,500
What does the PC cost out of 700?

401
00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:28,340
What's the hard drive on it? Several gigs, probably.

402
00:44:28,610 --> 00:44:32,450
Yeah, yeah, yeah. There's no m in the hard drive anymore, right?

403
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:37,080
There's a G on the hard drive. And what else?

404
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:41,780
Is it faster or smaller? Can it do videos, do you think?

405
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:49,490
I do videos on my PC with a 42 megabyte hard drive and now you can do word processing and spreadsheets.

406
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:54,170
You know, that's basically what you can handle on that hard drive.

407
00:44:54,590 --> 00:45:01,640
And your storage would have to be on floppy disks because you fill up the 42 megabyte hard drive with your files.

408
00:45:01,910 --> 00:45:08,720
So basically the hard drive is just to run the run the software or course the RAM, a lot of tiny compared to what today's would be.

409
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:16,189
Okay. So for $700 versus 7000, you're not getting the same product.

410
00:45:16,190 --> 00:45:26,630
You're getting a product that is almost indistinguishable, know it's almost not even the same creature the capabilities of it.

411
00:45:26,930 --> 00:45:32,690
And plus they're pretty now. I think it was like £40 and big and ugly and boxy.

412
00:45:32,690 --> 00:45:36,560
Now it's there's less sleek things. So.

413
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:42,139
Technology did not raise the price of PCs.

414
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:45,350
Technological change dramatically decreased the price of PCs.

415
00:45:48,150 --> 00:45:48,360
Okay.

416
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:57,570
So why is that so different that health care wires are about what technology drives spending increases in health care makes everything more expensive.

417
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:06,500
Do you want Shark Tank or no old Shark Tank is to replace Shark Tank.

418
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:15,640
I have a new TV that I've developed. I'm looking for venture capital for my TV company.

419
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:22,630
It is 95% as good. As the typical TV on the market.

420
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:28,790
What's a typical big screen TV costs like, say, a 5055 inch, 1200 dollars.

421
00:46:29,770 --> 00:46:34,020
So I can produce a TV that's 95% as good as that for $600.

422
00:46:34,030 --> 00:46:38,650
Sell it for $600. Sharks.

423
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:43,350
Anybody interested in investing in my company should think I have a business here that I can make some money on.

424
00:46:43,350 --> 00:46:47,460
And therefore, you could make some money investing in. Okay.

425
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:53,890
Now let's turn it into health care. So that's the first Shark Tank pitch.

426
00:46:53,900 --> 00:47:01,910
I'm a winner. I've got the sharks invested. You guys are making me great offers maybe $5 million for 10% of your business.

427
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:07,720
Okay, now let's turn to health care. I've developed a drug.

428
00:47:09,990 --> 00:47:16,830
That's 95% as good at saving your life as the existing drug, and it costs half as much.

429
00:47:19,410 --> 00:47:23,070
Sharks in urine. Any other sharks in.

430
00:47:25,850 --> 00:47:32,870
Anybody that's out that was in on the TV deal. Why it's not good marketing.

431
00:47:33,590 --> 00:47:43,820
I mean, for the people who can afford this drug, they want to go first and maybe does that have maybe something to do with it?

432
00:47:46,090 --> 00:47:50,320
Okay. So what? I'm selling you the TV. Who pays for that TV?

433
00:47:53,440 --> 00:48:00,560
You pay 100% of it. There's no insurance company that says, Oh, yeah, we're going to cover 80% of the cost of any television you want to buy.

434
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:10,110
Now there is health insurance that says recover 80% of the cost of a drug you buy or you can buy any drug for a fixed copay of $25.

435
00:48:11,230 --> 00:48:17,610
Now, if I had fixed co-pay of $25 and you tell me this drug is is 95% as good as the more expensive one?

436
00:48:17,610 --> 00:48:22,260
Do you want it? Oh, [INAUDIBLE], no. I want the good stuff.

437
00:48:26,290 --> 00:48:38,580
And so now think about incentives to do R&D. My incentives to develop the drug that's 5% better than the existing one, even if it costs twice as much.

438
00:48:41,130 --> 00:48:49,320
That's an easier proposition to sell than the drug that's 95% as good and cost half as much if somebody else is paying the bill.

439
00:48:50,970 --> 00:48:54,030
It's not like the TV world where the consumer is paying the bill.

440
00:48:54,030 --> 00:48:56,999
And you can look at it and say, you know, if I squint super hard,

441
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:04,230
maybe I can imagine there's a difference between Hertz TV and the Sanyo or the Sony or the Toshiba.

442
00:49:05,790 --> 00:49:10,850
I'm not even sure. So 600 versus 1200?

443
00:49:10,910 --> 00:49:19,240
Oh, yeah, you bet. I'm in for $600. So we got kind of this feedback loop.

444
00:49:19,930 --> 00:49:23,390
So we protect people from the cost of care for good reason.

445
00:49:23,410 --> 00:49:29,930
There's a high financial risk there. But then that changes the incentives for what to develop.

446
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:34,700
Developing the cheaper way of doing something is not quite as good.

447
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:38,929
It's not as attractive as developing the slightly better way of doing something,

448
00:49:38,930 --> 00:49:46,250
even though it's more expensive and increases the financial risk and therefore increases the demand for insurance that you can see over decades.

449
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,270
You see that accumulate.

450
00:49:58,010 --> 00:50:00,799
It's an interesting model, the development of medical technology.

451
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:06,080
It uses terms a little bit differently than we do sort of in everyday language, says.

452
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:09,590
Conditions start with a situation of nanotechnology.

453
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:14,060
Let's go back to, say, the beginnings of medicine when we didn't know how to do anything.

454
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:19,220
So nanotechnology is us. We really don't understand the disease, and it's not treatable.

455
00:50:20,030 --> 00:50:27,410
All we can do is maybe some palliation, some symptom relief, comfort that's generally pretty cheap.

456
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:29,360
It's generally inexpensive.

457
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:37,580
So nanotechnology is, you know, I'm sorry, I don't really know what's going on with you or I don't know what's going on with you,

458
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:43,550
but I don't I know there isn't anything I could do to help you. Then we move to what Thomas calls half way technology.

459
00:50:43,850 --> 00:50:48,890
Now, halfway technology is kind of what usually, in everyday parlance we talk about is high technology.

460
00:50:49,730 --> 00:50:54,800
We've got expensive stuff that can help. The disease can be partially treated.

461
00:50:55,130 --> 00:51:06,560
Generally, care is expensive and it uses what we would sort of everyday terms term high technology, MRI's, surgeries, robotics, biotech.

462
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:15,170
And then eventually we might move to a condition to a situation where that disease is now in a high technology state of the world.

463
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:21,200
And what he calls high technology is very different. It's we now understand the disease well enough,

464
00:51:21,950 --> 00:51:28,700
and we've developed ways that we can very effectively either prevent it altogether or treat it very effectively at early stages.

465
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:34,850
And oftentimes that's relatively cheap. So think about something like polio.

466
00:51:36,590 --> 00:51:41,690
We started out in nanotechnology. You know, 1930s.

467
00:51:41,690 --> 00:51:45,010
It's like, well, you know, take a warm bath.

468
00:51:45,020 --> 00:51:49,250
It might help help you feel a little better. And that's what we did for polio.

469
00:51:49,610 --> 00:51:54,469
And then here's a brace that we can make for your legs to help you walk a little bit.

470
00:51:54,470 --> 00:51:58,940
Or we put you in a wheelchair pretty cheap. All we do is treating the symptoms.

471
00:51:59,060 --> 00:51:59,890
We're palpitating.

472
00:52:01,250 --> 00:52:07,700
You know, we're saying, well, this is the best way we can figure out how to help you live with your condition, about which we can do nothing.

473
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:18,920
Then we developed some halfway technologies, some big expensive machines that we could put you in that could improve you a bit.

474
00:52:22,330 --> 00:52:29,290
And then we came up with the vaccine and now polio, although there have been a few cases recently, but essentially polio is gone.

475
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:41,830
Anybody here is stressed about getting polio yourselves. If we were sitting here in the 1930s, all of your hands would have shot up.

476
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:51,580
So that has gone from non technology. We can do a few things to make you a little more comfortable or help you move around halfway.

477
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:56,020
Technology, which is expensive and not terribly effective. Now we're in high technology.

478
00:52:57,190 --> 00:53:04,239
So the way technology then sort of increases spending is that a lot of the transitions that we've seen have been from 1 to 2,

479
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:13,410
from non technology to a halfway. Those are sort of dominating transitions from halfway technology to high technology.

480
00:53:14,910 --> 00:53:20,070
So kind of historically, over this time period, we've gone from A to B more often than we got be to see.

481
00:53:25,330 --> 00:53:31,180
Another way in which technology could increase cost is it might sort of reinforce or interact with other factors.

482
00:53:32,410 --> 00:53:35,650
So obesity was something that was mentioned when we were looking for causes.

483
00:53:36,670 --> 00:53:46,570
So the study looked at health care spending growth between 1987 and 2001 and asked what fraction of that spending growth was attributable to obesity.

484
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:56,140
The answer a pretty big 27%. More than a quarter of the spending growth over that 14 year period, they argued, was attributable to obesity.

485
00:53:57,550 --> 00:54:01,360
But then they asked a more subtle question and actually sort of more interesting.

486
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:05,890
What does it mean attributable to obesity? You could actually mean two different things.

487
00:54:07,450 --> 00:54:13,720
It could mean that the share of the population that was obese went up raising spending,

488
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:20,080
even if the spending per obese patient relative to not obese patients hadn't changed

489
00:54:20,830 --> 00:54:26,710
or was even if we treated obese people the exact same way in 2001 as we did in 1987,

490
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:32,770
just the fact there are more of them is going to make spending go up. But it could also mean sort of the reverse of that.

491
00:54:33,010 --> 00:54:38,440
So suppose the prevalence hadn't changed one bit, but the care had changed.

492
00:54:39,370 --> 00:54:44,589
So now say we had the conditions associated with obesity are now treated more intensively.

493
00:54:44,590 --> 00:54:54,590
Say we have new drugs for diabetes. So we could have had an obesity associated increase in spending without any change in the prevalence of obesity.

494
00:54:54,950 --> 00:55:00,020
Just because treating those conditions related to obesity became more expensive.

495
00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:05,000
And they said, actually, well, the answer was both, but it was actually a little more the latter than the former.

496
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:09,780
So is there decomposition? He said.

497
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:16,110
Of that 27%, less than half, 12% was due to the increase in prevalence.

498
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:19,230
In other words, if we would. If the treatments.

499
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:28,360
Given to obese patients for all the conditions associated with that were the same in 2001 as they were in 1987.

500
00:55:28,690 --> 00:55:36,730
And we've just had the change in the prevalence. We have had 12% increase since we have explained 12% of the total spending increase that occurred.

501
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:46,690
But if we held the prevalence constant and just asked how treatment patterns change, that would have explained 15% of the spending increase.

502
00:55:48,010 --> 00:55:56,140
So the 27% that was, quote, obesity associated, more than half was actually you could kind of say technology loosely.

503
00:55:56,320 --> 00:56:05,340
We're treating people differently. Okay.

504
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:11,760
Replay a third shark tank game. I've got a new health insurance plan, and I will tell you my slogan.

505
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:18,710
I'm going to ask if you want to invest it. 1965 Technology at 1965 prices.

506
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:25,590
Sharks. You got to love. This isn't 1965 prices.

507
00:56:25,620 --> 00:56:31,300
Wouldn't that be awesome? I'll be investing in my company.

508
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:36,850
My God. Technology. Okay.

509
00:56:36,850 --> 00:56:42,610
So very old. So basically what you have just done is a cost benefit analysis.

510
00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:50,920
You've done a cost benefit analysis sort of at the gut level of the change in medical technology relative to the change in medical spending.

511
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:57,639
Since I picked 1965, because that was a year Medicare and Medicaid were enacted.

512
00:56:57,640 --> 00:57:01,120
So I can just pick the hat as a sort of random starting year.

513
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:07,450
So what you've said is that on average, as expensive as this new medical technology has been,

514
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:14,950
and I hate how expensive it is, I'd love to have 1965 prices, but it's been worth it.

515
00:57:18,150 --> 00:57:22,620
I have to take the good and the bad. So the bad is 2022 prices.

516
00:57:22,620 --> 00:57:31,530
The good is 2022 medical technology. That whole bundle, paying what we pay, getting what we get.

517
00:57:32,250 --> 00:57:42,450
Every one of you has said implicitly here is better than the old bundle of paying very little, but sacrificing all those new technologies.

518
00:57:43,910 --> 00:57:48,790
So we wouldn't have statins. We wouldn't have a lot of chemotherapies.

519
00:57:48,790 --> 00:57:50,470
We wouldn't have the new hepatitis drug.

520
00:57:52,570 --> 00:58:03,070
We'd be spending a lot less, but kind of on a gut level, your projection of my investment proposition says that, yeah, I hate high medical spending.

521
00:58:03,070 --> 00:58:11,620
I sure love to get 1965 medical spending, but it's not worth it to give up the gains that we've had since that on average.

522
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:21,100
That's sort of a gut level test that you think new medical technology, new medical knowledge, despite its higher cost, has been worth us.

523
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:24,310
We'd be worse off for not having it.

524
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:32,620
So I was thinking, there's only one thing in the world worse that expensive new medical technology that's not having expensive new medical technology.

525
00:58:35,390 --> 00:58:38,900
Doesn't mean that every change is worth the cost or that every use is worth the cost.

526
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:45,910
So there isn't a lot of waste on the margin. But since we have expensive, expensive new technology, if we apply it in cases where it's not helping.

527
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:54,390
Clearly that's bad. But if you take the good and the bad, the whole bundle, I take it.

528
00:58:55,110 --> 00:58:59,850
I wouldn't go back. Okay.

529
00:58:59,890 --> 00:59:04,940
Now let's do a more affordable cost benefit analysis instead of this sort of gut level one that we all just.

530
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:13,370
Jay Cutler looked at five different conditions. So they aren't absolutely everything in medical care,

531
00:59:13,370 --> 00:59:19,429
but you can't pick them strategically to be sort of important conditions that were had different types of treatments,

532
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:26,810
affected different populations and had fairly big changes in the way treatments were done over the time period that he studied.

533
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:34,490
So he looked at heart attack treatments, low birth weight, depression, cataracts and breast cancer.

534
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:39,200
So heart attacks mainly affecting people sort of 50 and older.

535
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:44,240
Low birth weight obviously affecting the exact opposite end of the spectrum.

536
00:59:44,570 --> 00:59:50,720
Depression affecting the population broadly, but being more of a quality of life issue than a quality of life issue.

537
00:59:51,800 --> 01:00:00,260
Cataracts affecting mainly people over 65 or 70, breast cancer mainly affecting women, say 40 to 70 or 80.

538
01:00:01,070 --> 01:00:05,780
So different types of treatments, different types of conditions, different types of populations.

539
01:00:06,470 --> 01:00:12,260
And where you looked is how did spending change for these conditions over time and how did outcomes change?

540
01:00:13,490 --> 01:00:21,620
And then use some assumptions based on cost effectiveness literature about how much a gain of quality adjusted life year would be worth.

541
01:00:24,470 --> 01:00:30,950
Now. He said, Well, for the first four of those conditions, he said the increased spending was worth it.

542
01:00:30,950 --> 01:00:39,620
In other words, outcomes improved enough that the increase in spending that occurred despite being a lot of dollars was worth it.

543
01:00:40,190 --> 01:00:46,250
In other words, we generated sufficient improvement to justify the added cost for the fifth one breast cancer.

544
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:50,210
He said it was approximately a wash, so even there it wasn't cost effective.

545
01:00:50,540 --> 01:00:55,310
It was just that the outcomes improved, kind of just barely enough to justify the costs.

546
01:00:56,300 --> 01:01:05,030
See standard I think of $100,000 per quality adjusted life year is an older study, so you could definitely put a bigger number in now.

547
01:01:05,030 --> 01:01:11,719
But for that time period you said, well, for four of these five things, he sort of said clearly the change in outcomes is worth.

548
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:15,500
The change in spending even for the first quarter was approximately even.

549
01:01:16,550 --> 01:01:22,160
There wasn't a single one of these conditions. He looked at where he said, Wow, if we could go back.

550
01:01:24,140 --> 01:01:31,580
Let's go back. We would have been better off in 1965 with 1965 technology in 1965, priceless.

551
01:01:31,580 --> 01:01:39,020
In my short story for four of the five conditions we definitely want to be in today's world in terms of outcomes,

552
01:01:39,260 --> 01:01:43,930
despite the cost and even for the fifth it was approximately equal.

553
01:01:45,110 --> 01:01:47,750
So there are no losers in the five things you looked at.

554
01:01:51,510 --> 01:01:57,630
And so to summarize, health care spending has kind of grown and grown rapidly for a lot of decades in this country.

555
01:01:58,140 --> 01:02:03,810
That kind of fake quote I gave you from last week's last week's New York Times, which was actually a quote from 1932.

556
01:02:06,700 --> 01:02:19,150
Same saying you think a lot of factors contribute, but probably the biggest things have been changing prices and changing technology.

557
01:02:21,130 --> 01:02:25,060
Growth and income has contributed, and that's obviously not a bad thing.

558
01:02:25,060 --> 01:02:28,930
If the reason we're spending more on health care is we're richer and we want to spend more on health care.

559
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:37,820
Can't argue that we're worse off because of that. But prices and technology be the single biggest factors.

560
01:02:39,470 --> 01:02:43,310
There is likely a lot of waste and inefficiency at the margin.

561
01:02:43,940 --> 01:02:50,540
So our Shark Tank rejection of my insurance plan says on average, new spending is worth it.

562
01:02:51,590 --> 01:02:58,100
It doesn't mean that's always worth it at the margin, do it using that care for one more patient doesn't always yield clearly better outcomes.

563
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:07,749
So there was a study that looked at cardiac revascularization procedures and how they how the use

564
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:12,490
of them changed based on whether people lived close to a hospital that offered those services.

565
01:03:14,980 --> 01:03:19,540
And they found that, yeah, if you live close to a hospital, offer those services, you're more likely to get them.

566
01:03:19,990 --> 01:03:26,170
And then they looked at outcomes and fairly found any difference in outcomes if little difference in like 30 day mortality.

567
01:03:26,170 --> 01:03:33,970
But by day 90, that difference was gone. So that doesn't imply that those procedures didn't save a lot of lives,

568
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:38,860
but it says those people who got it because they happen to live close to a facility

569
01:03:38,860 --> 01:03:42,430
that offered it but wouldn't have gotten it if they lived a little further away.

570
01:03:43,090 --> 01:03:48,340
So think of those as marginal patients that were extending the treatment to they didn't really benefit.

571
01:03:49,330 --> 01:03:56,100
So on average, that might have been a very beneficial treatment. But at the margin it might not of them.

572
01:03:57,240 --> 01:04:04,410
If we think about things like administrative waste and clinical waste, those things are pretty hard to define clearly.

573
01:04:05,190 --> 01:04:11,880
So we spend between 50 and 30% of the U.S. health care spending is on administration.

574
01:04:13,830 --> 01:04:19,020
A typical, typical country that might be about seven and a half percent or about double or lower.

575
01:04:19,020 --> 01:04:26,520
And that's about now. Even estimate how it was for administration is hard because you know,

576
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:30,660
what's administration versus what is sort of the direct support of the care that's being delivered.

577
01:04:31,530 --> 01:04:36,359
So what's the care costs? What's the administrative cost? And even if we agree on that and saying, well,

578
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:42,780
what part of administrative costs are wasteful and what part of administrative costs are necessary for running the system

579
01:04:43,230 --> 01:04:51,420
or might even help improve the efficiency of the system over time by changing incentives to provide low value care,

580
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:58,470
for example, is very difficult. But clearly there's a lot that's not adding a lot of value to patient outcomes.

581
01:04:59,220 --> 01:05:03,660
So that's probably the clearest way you can conceptually say what part of administrative class is wasteful,

582
01:05:04,380 --> 01:05:09,510
saying, look at our patients, be our patients are arguably better off because this is being done.

583
01:05:10,170 --> 01:05:18,120
And if the answer is no. So one example might be we've got how many different payers in this country?

584
01:05:18,150 --> 01:05:23,250
Hundreds. So each one has their own claims processing system.

585
01:05:23,260 --> 01:05:27,780
Each one has their own requirements. Each one has their own prior authorization requirements.

586
01:05:27,780 --> 01:05:32,820
And how you have to get authorization to get approval to do a procedure or a test.

587
01:05:33,870 --> 01:05:40,980
So imagine we standardize that to a central system that all payers used.

588
01:05:42,030 --> 01:05:46,010
Would patients be harmed by that? No.

589
01:05:47,020 --> 01:05:54,730
Would administrative costs go down? Yes. So some of those administrative costs, you can say that they're clearly waste.

590
01:05:56,230 --> 01:05:59,950
It's the cost of running the system. It could be reduced.

591
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:03,550
We could have the same outcomes. So say the claims clearinghouse.

592
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:09,159
Do you know how checks are cleared in this country of transfers or managing bank

593
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:13,210
accounts in Arizona where you write a check or you're doing it electronically?

594
01:06:13,810 --> 01:06:17,440
There's one central clearinghouse. All banks participate.

595
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:24,050
So we've got a central clearinghouse.

596
01:06:24,530 --> 01:06:31,670
We've got you know, you write this check and it goes into account somebody else that has it in another bank.

597
01:06:33,410 --> 01:06:37,910
Now, if I have a different bank than you, I write the check. It goes to the same clearinghouse.

598
01:06:38,780 --> 01:06:42,800
Even if that money is being transferred to account, somebody else is in some different bank.

599
01:06:46,860 --> 01:06:52,409
So the clearing of checks, it was clear whether electronic or physical kind of goes through a central

600
01:06:52,410 --> 01:06:57,900
warehouse that's much more efficient than having every bank set up its own system.

601
01:06:57,930 --> 01:07:05,730
That then has to figure out how to talk to every other bank system. You know.

602
01:07:05,820 --> 01:07:15,600
So there clearly are examples where you could say this aspect of administrative spending is wasteful because we can come up with a plausible way to

603
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:24,870
reduce that spending and that way would not harm patient outcomes or patient care or patient convenience or anything else that matters to patients.

604
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:31,850
So that's sort of one conceptual way you can think of administrative waste, clinical waste.

605
01:07:33,590 --> 01:07:39,810
We've already talked about that in some ways, low value care. You're trying to reduce low value care.

606
01:07:40,450 --> 01:07:43,080
Mark was here talking about value based insurance design.

607
01:07:44,220 --> 01:07:50,610
So clinical waste, you could kind of sort of think analogously it's care that doesn't help patients.

608
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:58,660
Or you can maybe think of a little bit more broadly and say care that doesn't help patients enough to justify its cost.

609
01:07:59,470 --> 01:08:03,940
Maybe it helps a little, but it's not worth it. So pure waste would be care.

610
01:08:03,940 --> 01:08:13,320
That doesn't help patients at all. So obviously eliminating that would decrease health care spending without harming.

611
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:20,940
Population health or individual health. But again, defining what's clinical waste.

612
01:08:23,190 --> 01:08:27,780
It's very difficult because it often matters. You know, they may be patient by patient.

613
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:31,290
The life saving service for me may be a wasteful service for you.

614
01:08:41,390 --> 01:08:44,780
So any questions? Comments?

615
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:52,030
Impressions. Reactions. What covered a lot of ground today?

616
01:08:59,870 --> 01:09:08,959
Happy Thanksgiving. I want my member of the technological incentive is pretty crazy and it seems like the technological incentive in terms

617
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:17,750
of how improvements in technology can change price is distorted by the fact that we have this third party system,

618
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:26,420
if I'm understanding correctly. Yeah. So that's yeah, that's the instrument insulating people from price.

619
01:09:26,420 --> 01:09:35,629
Then you're changing the R&D instead of substantially incentive to make that TV that I was able to sell a lot of your shorts on.

620
01:09:35,630 --> 01:09:38,630
Investing in just isn't as strong in health care.

621
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:44,570
Is that like the leading cause for increases in drug prices?

622
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:54,500
Is that would that be the factor the third parties system distorting and removing people from the price of paying for new technology?

623
01:09:54,860 --> 01:09:59,170
It would certainly be a big factor of drugs.

624
01:09:59,270 --> 01:10:02,900
So drugs can add a lot of value potentially.

625
01:10:03,260 --> 01:10:10,370
And therefore, can they they can support a high price, but you don't have the incentive to kind of come up with the cheaper drug.

626
01:10:11,420 --> 01:10:19,010
It's just as good or almost as good. It's easier to market the drug that's a little bit better, even if it's a lot more expensive.

627
01:10:19,430 --> 01:10:20,690
And then in our system,

628
01:10:20,690 --> 01:10:28,550
we can support a pretty high price because we don't have sort of central negotiation or price setting through the kind of negotiating with each payer,

629
01:10:30,170 --> 01:10:36,320
which doesn't have nearly the power that a country would to say, Oh, you want to be in our countries formulary and sell this drug at all.

630
01:10:37,340 --> 01:10:43,630
Okay, here's what we'll offer you. One.

631
01:10:44,950 --> 01:10:47,290
What you just said makes sense, I think.

632
01:10:47,830 --> 01:10:58,840
But for the insurance companies, since they're paying for all of the drug prices, will they be more motivated to choose one that's cheaper for 95%?

633
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:06,630
Or is that 5% of the people who are still. Sick or not good as well.

634
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:11,190
So a lot of insurance companies will have sort of tiered co-pays.

635
01:11:11,730 --> 01:11:15,570
They'll have a generic will be $5 out of pocket.

636
01:11:15,590 --> 01:11:21,480
A typically preferred brand will be 25 and a non-preferred brand might be 75.

637
01:11:22,050 --> 01:11:28,110
To try to steer patients towards the generics, but still the generic supposed to be equivalent of the original.

638
01:11:29,580 --> 01:11:33,030
It's a harder sell to get. Physicians also have to prescribe.

639
01:11:33,780 --> 01:11:39,629
So yes, the physician has to be willing to prescribe and the patient willing to accept the

640
01:11:39,630 --> 01:11:45,840
prescription for the drug that is known to be not as good in order to save the money.

641
01:11:46,830 --> 01:11:51,720
And it's probably not going to be the willingness. So you've got multiple parties involved in the decision.

642
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:56,010
The patient has to accept it, the physician has to be willing to prescribe it.

643
01:11:56,310 --> 01:11:58,990
And then you have the insurer setting the payment incentives.

644
01:11:59,310 --> 01:12:06,180
So the insurer can certainly try to say, hey, if this drug is have almost as good than half the price, I'm going to give you a deal on it.

645
01:12:06,810 --> 01:12:14,100
And maybe for some patients that will overcome the fact it's not as good and some physicians would be willing to prescribe it.

646
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:19,800
But you have to also overcome those two hurdles, the patient's willingness to accept and the physician's willingness to strike.

647
01:12:21,450 --> 01:12:26,990
And you've got tons of physicians who would be jumping up and down to say, yes, this drug is me,

648
01:12:27,330 --> 01:12:31,469
is not quite as likely to save your life as this other drug, but I'll prescribe you less.

649
01:12:31,470 --> 01:12:37,380
Not as good. It's also physicians are paying for the drug either.

650
01:12:40,110 --> 01:12:43,260
All right. Have a good break and see you on Monday.

651
01:12:56,550 --> 01:13:11,670
All right. You're going to probably I don't want to do it.

652
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:15,750
Thanks for joining us this early on.

653
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:35,339
We do have a good break and come back to us for an outline of something like a tornado.

654
01:13:35,340 --> 01:13:39,060
And I said that will really give you a little extra time.

655
01:13:40,770 --> 01:13:58,560
Kind of like I said, you're actually seeing a little competition right after that.

656
01:13:59,220 --> 01:14:04,120
Yeah. Soon as we get back on Thanksgiving.

657
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:07,350
30302.

658
01:14:08,850 --> 01:14:14,169
I was just about to go. According to everyone else.

659
01:14:14,170 --> 01:14:20,140
I think you can get it. Yeah, just ordinary business.

660
01:14:20,230 --> 01:14:24,610
The biggest thing, in my opinion. We lost the most points on that.

661
01:14:27,860 --> 01:14:30,910
I need to look at that rubric. Is that actually like part of the great is audience.

662
01:14:31,630 --> 01:14:38,030
Yeah. Gosh. So plant some questions if you wanna have my wife make a couple of pies and just hand them out, then I'll wait.

663
01:14:38,310 --> 01:14:42,190
Oh, yeah, I know. Whatever gets with this question.

664
01:14:42,730 --> 01:14:47,990
Yeah, I can, you can find questions like tell me and just like text me like two questions.

665
01:14:48,010 --> 01:14:51,819
I'm not kidding. I can get you to jump on that.

666
01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:56,650
I don't know. We talk to my group and see what's see what's what. But you have a good break, my friend.

667
01:14:58,010 --> 01:15:07,100
You too. Because I'm. Oh.

668
01:15:10,100 --> 01:15:22,540
I grew up in abandoned. Yeah.

669
01:15:42,940 --> 01:15:43,110
You.
