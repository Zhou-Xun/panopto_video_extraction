1
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:17,080
I think. All right.

2
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:24,700
I just wanted to start this morning by saying that I loved your discussion board discussion theme so much.

3
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:34,000
This week really gets into it. You post meals and poems and play.

4
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:42,070
It's great to see all of the things that to come up and how you respond to each other.

5
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:48,100
So I really love seeing that. Thank you for kind of engaging in that so much.

6
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:58,419
You know, before we start, did anybody want to talk about a specific reading that stood out to them or something that they noticed in

7
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:05,260
the discussion or that was like really interesting or made you think about something in a different way.

8
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:23,839
You know, you're eating bagels, but. Sasha said that she wants us to.

9
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:37,360
All right now. I won't make you write a poem, but you can if you want.

10
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:47,980
Well, I'll just tell you some of the things that I noticed.

11
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:53,230
And as we as we go through it, this sounds like something that you wrote or that you're like, Oh, yeah, I remember that.

12
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:55,270
That was interesting. I wanna talk about it. Just stop me.

13
00:01:55,690 --> 00:02:03,009
But I just want to kind of put these, like, themes out there before we start talking about the lecture material for the day.

14
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:09,340
So first, you know, as the discussion started, I don't know if I see the stuff at the top of that was the first thing posted.

15
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:19,780
Okay. So Cynthia, I think you started with the poem and kind of relating that to the Courtney article about masculinity and health.

16
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:26,290
And that got people really kind of thinking about that article and about, um,

17
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:36,410
kind of moving me on this idea of thinking about gender and health as sort of just women's health, which has been more prominent in more recent years.

18
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:45,190
So I wondered, did you want to say anything about that or um, how are you, how you do the connections between that one and what you read?

19
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:01,520
Well. Yeah.

20
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:24,440
Yeah. Yeah.

21
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:43,540
I don't understand. I guess I was just thinking. Yeah.

22
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:51,710
Yeah. I don't really know how it came in my brain.

23
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:57,290
How different? Constructive.

24
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:28,350
Not. Yeah.

25
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:35,690
No. And it's like it's a really interesting kind of it's a it's an interesting observation that like

26
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:44,099
a lot of times we think about being y each year as being harmful to women and women's health.

27
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:50,670
And we don't as often think about how it hurts everybody in various ways.

28
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:57,040
Um, and I think there are people who are writing about this in the area of racial disparities,

29
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:06,960
pure whiteness, and how, um, whiteness kind of is problematic across the board in various ways.

30
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:10,550
Um. Yeah.

31
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:21,750
Yeah. Yeah. That's not to say that the herbs are equal.

32
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:30,060
Right. Because there are things, as the article points out, that like that if there are things about whiteness,

33
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:37,060
that if you can take advantage of them that are that are things that we would say or do,

34
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,470
that we probably want power and resources and things like that.

35
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:47,879
And the same with this idea of masculinity to rise up like Courtney is pointing out,

36
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:54,180
there are things that men get by buying into this, but there's this cost to particularly around how.

37
00:05:55,990 --> 00:06:02,830
Yeah. Like This is great.

38
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:29,640
I think they are. I didn't know they were there.

39
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:39,610
They come. And then so there's a study.

40
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:55,220
They have to be. When they come.

41
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:08,349
So they believe men's reports of pain more than women's reports of pain because of some of his

42
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:16,480
ideas about masculinity and not being willing to like to admit pain or suffering or weakness.

43
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,430
Yeah. And so it gets wrapped up in a lot of it.

44
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:30,570
That was another comment that came out in here was that a number of you were pointing out that like medicine has traditionally been a

45
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:42,129
male dominated masculine field and that it's interesting that women are more like higher utilizers of health care and things like that.

46
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:50,470
But then a lot of times they're their concerns and health issues are discussed in the medical field.

47
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:54,520
Did anybody want to say anything about that? I I'm trying to remember who brought it up.

48
00:07:54,520 --> 00:08:00,190
I think, oh, Alysia Noelle is who I wrote down on that one.

49
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:04,940
Any of you want to talk about it? Out here.

50
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:10,260
I really got. Yeah.

51
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:25,500
Yeah. I'm glad you're here. I work for. That women would come.

52
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:34,530
You. They would be talking about your.

53
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:41,640
And it wasn't until I heard.

54
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:48,530
You know this guy? I don't know. Yeah, I saw him.

55
00:08:56,650 --> 00:09:04,240
Yeah. So even in a field of medicine that focused on women's health concerns, we're still not taking it seriously.

56
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:09,700
He was president and raised the concern that it would like angry attentions.

57
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:19,100
Did you want to add anything about me? Really?

58
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:30,640
Yeah, I. Oh, so okay, so some other kind of things that came up in the readings.

59
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:42,070
A lot of people were interested in whether what Kourtney talked about also applies in other countries or to people who are non-binary or transgender.

60
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:48,220
Right. So what were your a lot of people talked about that I have Victoria Bella.

61
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:52,710
All right. But Andrew Cullen and maybe more if.

62
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:29,820
Don't you have too much sugar? Yeah.

63
00:10:29,850 --> 00:11:04,730
Victory. Yeah.

64
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:10,950
So you felt like what he was talking about also applied in China and other Asian countries.

65
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:23,850
So not just U.S. All of you want to do you want to talk about I think you brought up machismo.

66
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:32,280
Yeah, I would say a little about what that is. Yeah.

67
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:50,590
Like. Very.

68
00:11:54,350 --> 00:12:04,160
So I'm just kind of. And I also.

69
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:34,460
I'm right here. Yeah.

70
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:38,820
But this small band like. Yeah, not there are not very many of us.

71
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:48,080
Yeah. It's I mean, a lot of it, particularly in epidemiology or anything that's with quantitative methods, it's because of small numbers.

72
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:56,660
So right now, like the most recent data that's from some of the Youth Behavioral Risk Survey

73
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:03,440
estimates that about point 6% of the U.S. population identifies as transgender.

74
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:09,319
So it's and it's been pretty consistent. There are differences by age.

75
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:16,820
Some definitely younger cohorts have higher, um, reports of us than like that older cohorts.

76
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:22,370
But I think the last numbers I had that were from a few years ago were 0.5%.

77
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:32,239
Now it's point 6%. So it's still really small. So it's difficult to kind of to study this population from an epidemiologic perspective.

78
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:37,850
And we talked about that last week also when we were talking about racial and ethnic disparities,

79
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:42,140
too, that when you have really small populations and you're using national surveys,

80
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:50,240
unless you do you unless your study is designed to oversample that population, it's really hard to do a quantitative.

81
00:13:51,770 --> 00:14:00,950
And so you typically have to use different kinds of methods, like more convenient sampling, snowball sampling.

82
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:06,290
People will use more qualitative methods rather than quantitative method.

83
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:13,670
So that's like that's a big piece of it. But it doesn't mean that, you know, the Portland people didn't have any data.

84
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:24,230
Right? So you can certainly theorize about transgender people in your life, theories of gender and how.

85
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:33,780
We'll talk about this more as we as we kind of go through it. What else did I want to.

86
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:40,520
Oh, Victoria, I thought you had a really nice point about the man's house paper.

87
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:46,100
And you were noticing that because this is, of course, before Roe versus Wade was overturned.

88
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:54,280
But you were noticing that the states where abortion access is lower are those states that have the worst child welfare policy.

89
00:14:54,350 --> 00:15:26,040
You. Yes.

90
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:38,850
You can see these like clusters kind of within states of policies that can potentially be harmful to women's health in particular.

91
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:46,520
And as you were noting, Victoria Children's Health as well. Um, oh, I thought this was a really great discussion.

92
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:50,490
So this was Patricia?

93
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,920
Sure, yeah. And I think you were talking about this, too.

94
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:05,090
So we're talking about how in the montages paper they concluded that women were more affected by social structure.

95
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:10,910
But then the court paper argued that women are more affected by social structure.

96
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:20,940
You want to talk about that? I just so like, I feel like gender is entirely produced by social structure, just like that's my problem.

97
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:28,640
And so I don't know how one or the other, but I'm also trained as a sociologist.

98
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:33,410
But you probably don't think gender is entirely socially produced.

99
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:37,210
But I do. And so I didn't like by that. Yeah, that's for sure.

100
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:42,270
What did you. What did you think? Yeah, I just like to put them together.

101
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:46,570
Yeah, I can. Came to my own conclusion. That would be like.

102
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:06,790
I really do have. Yeah.

103
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:10,230
And I don't like I don't remember that.

104
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:16,410
I was trying to think back to like to Courtney and like that piece of the argument.

105
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:23,010
I mean, I definitely remember the montages paper sets that write that like, you know, based on this quantitative analysis,

106
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:26,670
it seems that these social structural factors are more important for women's health.

107
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:34,980
I mean, I think it's interesting, though, to think about how social structure is being conceptualized differently in those two papers.

108
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:49,690
Yeah, come on. Almost.

109
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:08,809
Yeah. I don't know that that's enough time difference for like that idea about gender and health to have changed.

110
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:19,700
That was I think they're just I think they're coming at these questions from very different lenses, like every one of those like like a demographer.

111
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:32,480
Right. Like they're they're looking at it from this like highly quantitative, um, almost like policy framework and thinking about structure,

112
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:45,650
defining social structure as more about laws and rules and systems that are in place that provide or don't provide,

113
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:49,520
like tangible resources for people like health care and things like that.

114
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:59,600
So like one way of thinking about social structure and then I think Courtney is talking about a different aspect of social structure,

115
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:04,390
which is a little bit more about. We?

116
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:11,770
See how they say that ideology is about.

117
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:20,440
The social position of women and men and about the value of masculinity and femininity.

118
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:32,800
And so I, I feel like they're talking about two different, slightly different components of what it both may be referring to as social structure.

119
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:38,700
Like, I think Courtney's is more about culture.

120
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,570
To me. Whereas the Montana paper is more about.

121
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:55,459
Or maybe I can say the quirky one is more about unobservable or latent aspects of social structure,

122
00:19:55,460 --> 00:20:02,270
whereas the mom's house one is more like directly observable stuff because we can see it in the laws.

123
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:07,709
Yeah, I think this might actually just be genuinely.

124
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:10,010
I didn't really understand. Yes.

125
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:23,510
Because if men are making behavioral choices that are really terrorist or healthy or not, are they not making choices?

126
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:28,040
Yeah. I mean, I think they are. I think he's yeah.

127
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:36,199
He doesn't seem to be arguing, though, that women use behavior as a way to demonstrate femininity, whereas he is arguing,

128
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:44,000
I think that men use health risk behavior actively to demonstrate masculinity and that that's the difference.

129
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:49,700
But yeah, I agree. It doesn't mean that women aren't making behavioral choices.

130
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:53,700
They may just be making them with different motivations.

131
00:20:54,610 --> 00:21:00,310
Like from his perspective. I mean, I think was the other thing I was going to say about that.

132
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:13,060
What related to something that. Maybe it'll come back to me.

133
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:23,200
Oh, I know what it was. There were. There was a discussion about the agency in the US and somebody raised the point.

134
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:29,320
Noel, you said, how much agency do boys and men really have you felt like making important?

135
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:35,710
That's giving a little too much weight so easily. Yeah.

136
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:40,130
I you a lot of. Thanks I gave you cause.

137
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,560
Yeah, it's like. I don't think it talks about structure that much.

138
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:50,400
We talked about, like, interpersonal and, like, personal choices, and I think, like.

139
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:56,670
Because gender is so assigned and so to perform to that like the idea.

140
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:07,010
For me, or at least like, I don't know. I mean, maybe just like the word agency doesn't capture exactly what's going on, but gender.

141
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:17,060
Yeah. And so feeling like maybe these choices that boys and men are making are,

142
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:24,139
are really like if we think back to in the beginning of the class when we talked about the Cockerham fever, the health lifestyles theory.

143
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:27,530
Right, about choices being enabled and constrained.

144
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:31,420
Um, I think that applies here too.

145
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:38,030
Right. How much are men's and women's choices constrained by gender norms?

146
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:46,730
And, you know, maybe part of what he's arguing about now that I think about it is that because men on average have more power,

147
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:52,940
that they have a greater ability to exercise their agency than women.

148
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:58,160
And therefore, you can view their behavioral choices as more freely chosen.

149
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:05,360
And those are by men. I mean, that could be I don't know, not in his head, but that could be part of the argument.

150
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:15,080
I mean, also, I think Courtney is a psychologist. So that can also help shape some of the way that the the perspective is presented there.

151
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:19,820
So that may be why you felt there was more of like an emphasis on the individual.

152
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:37,140
Before. We're going to talk about sex versus gender in just a second and thinking about that analytically, uh, what's the.

153
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:46,790
Okay. So I think that that covers most of your things. But if as we're talking, if something else comes up and you want to jump in, please do.

154
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:56,970
All right. So Abbott did a really nice job of saying What we're about to do is a little silly, but we're going to do it anyway.

155
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:03,809
We're going to try to like distinguish between sex and gender and talk about what those are and try to

156
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:09,240
think about them in the context of like epidemiologic research and how you would use thing analytically,

157
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:16,410
which as many of you mentioned, is hard. So when we talk about sex, what are we talking about?

158
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:39,950
Yeah. Okay. So we're talking about biological differences between females and males.

159
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,800
What are some examples of these biological differences?

160
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:53,000
Yeah. Okay. So it's X chromosomes.

161
00:24:56,210 --> 00:25:02,960
X and Y chromosomes. What else? Reproductive processes and reproductive.

162
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:14,520
Secondary sex characteristics lay. Yeah.

163
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:17,610
Facial hair, body shapes and proportions.

164
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:32,640
Yeah, those are them. So things about physical bodies, things like percent fat, muscle, mass height, reproductive systems, sex hormones, chromosomes.

165
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:40,889
These are kind of things that we think of as being aspects of sex and being biological differences between females and males.

166
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:46,050
But Albert, do you want to talk about this idea that you that you shared about sex as a social construct?

167
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:51,990
I'm not an expert in this, but I have friends who are. So we'll take your word for it.

168
00:25:52,020 --> 00:26:03,659
Yeah, I've linked a blog post. But, I mean, basically the idea is that, like, we think that those things all bundle together.

169
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:08,890
Yeah. Consistently, really. But in actuality, they don't necessarily.

170
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:15,660
Like, an easy example to mention is that like a lot of women have cisgender women.

171
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:21,580
I did again and I signed it on top of handling math here.

172
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,890
Like how you call breath on a man?

173
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:32,450
Yeah, yeah. But and then when you get down to even more like sex science and stuff,

174
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:38,530
that's not necessarily as like a lot of people have a lot of variation in their bodies that you just kind of like.

175
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:46,110
Right. So that's how sections of the sexes decided to be socially conservative.

176
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:56,730
Yeah. So this idea that there's these different aspects and they don't all cluster together perfectly in a way that we could with 100% certainty,

177
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:05,190
say that like you are a biological male, you are a biological female, and we put you in as like one of these two categories.

178
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:13,610
But how do we do this in research? We do that.

179
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:18,050
We put people in one or the other.

180
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:23,149
And it's interesting how these questions have been asked over time and surveys.

181
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:30,350
So like a lot of times and surveys are big surveys that were interviewer administered.

182
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:34,760
They didn't ask people, the interviewer would say male or female.

183
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:44,810
Um, and then, you know, then there's some surveys that ask people to self-report, but there would only be two options.

184
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:49,279
They didn't assess gender separately from sex.

185
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:58,640
And so usually there's just one question. So there's like there's a lot of variation across studies of how this is measured and how it's reported.

186
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:01,900
And I think it's starting to change now.

187
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:08,870
Like you see a lot of studies now that will ask things like, what was the sex that you were assigned at birth?

188
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:14,389
And then they'll ask like a separate question about what is your gender identity?

189
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:19,460
And then there'll be different options for that. But it's still a little bit in flux how that's being measured.

190
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:24,860
And for the most part, in epidemiologic research, we're just using.

191
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:29,300
Like male. Female. Man. Woman zero one. And a variable.

192
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:53,620
So if that sucks, then what is gender? Yeah.

193
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:59,650
You're brave today. All that is themselves.

194
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:10,800
There are a lot of. Sexual minorities.

195
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:17,750
Sexual and gender minorities. It's a very.

196
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:27,160
Okay? Yes. So gender thinking about gender is something that's more socially constructed.

197
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:33,370
Although, as we just talked about, sex can also be kind of thought of as a social construction,

198
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:40,060
but still meant to represent some biologic, some objective biological reality that we just can't see.

199
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:43,530
Whereas gender isn't really meant to like to do that.

200
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:53,920
Right? So gender is kind of about society's expectations about how people who are women or men are supposed to act.

201
00:29:55,510 --> 00:30:03,880
And so it is socially constructed. So these cultural meanings that get attached to masculinity and femininity vary across place and time.

202
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,169
That's what we were saying earlier.

203
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:18,390
Like Victoria was bringing up the example of China that some of this is is similar across many different contexts, but it doesn't have to be.

204
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:25,020
Right. It could vary. And even like what Cynthia was mentioning with the poem and thinking about this,

205
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:31,439
the idea that Courtney brings up around intersectionality and the way men in different social

206
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:37,890
classes with different social identities might demonstrate masculinity in different ways.

207
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:55,860
So what are some examples of these type of expectations around gender or so conventions about gender roles or behaviors?

208
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:09,230
We talked a little bit earlier in the context of pain and going to the doctor that like there's,

209
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:17,120
uh, uh, there's a norm that men not express physical pain that might be one.

210
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:39,600
What are some other socially constructed differences? Yeah. I think, you know.

211
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:48,820
I think I know what you're saying, says Schindler. The expectations are from getting married or being in a relationship there.

212
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:54,049
You talk about how working women. Expected to marry in 4 minutes.

213
00:31:54,050 --> 00:32:03,390
More cops. Yeah.

214
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:08,890
So there could be there to be differences in expectations around marriage or around other aspects of it, you know?

215
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:15,890
Right. Like what are some kind of expectations for women in the family context versus men?

216
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:24,830
Yeah, sure. Yeah. Yeah.

217
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:47,830
Like. Like, yeah. So, yeah, there's a lot of gendered expectations around caregiving and children coming in.

218
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:56,470
Yeah. Yes.

219
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:12,380
Good. And we have. We have. And then I noticed that.

220
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:19,050
Right into your house. Yeah. And all of the other stuff.

221
00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:28,409
Yeah. So expectations around household chores and things are gendered too.

222
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:36,960
And this idea that women are kind of primarily responsible for cleaning or any kind of work, health care or that kind of thing.

223
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:40,620
Yeah, there was there used to be commercial. I think they're gone now.

224
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:45,540
But they were for Clorox and they had this little song about Mama's Got the magic of Clorox to.

225
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:48,960
You guys are living on your area? Yeah. Yeah.

226
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:53,940
Let me get a first. It's also just expected that women want children.

227
00:33:54,230 --> 00:34:01,510
Yeah. So caregiving is one thing, but also your identify, you know, words that you create.

228
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:05,670
Yeah. For men, that's not usually that same. I think it's kind of the opposite of like.

229
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:09,829
You want to do that is the stereotypical idea. Yeah.

230
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:17,000
So different ideas about what women and men should want and do within a family context.

231
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:29,150
Differences. Child care.

232
00:34:29,530 --> 00:35:15,270
Yeah. So differences in beauty standards and expectations for conforming to dominant standards.

233
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:23,070
I would like someone. Yeah.

234
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:32,840
That's that's one you'll hear a lot. I have certainly heard a lot that like this idea that a dad is babysitting their two children.

235
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:37,890
Yeah. I mean, it's just this sort of idea that, like, um.

236
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:44,310
You're doing something that's that's beyond what you can expect.

237
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:47,580
That's a normal part of being a parent.

238
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:58,120
So, yeah, I mean, there's definitely that I think where we see the gender stuff the most today is around like parenting stuff.

239
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:03,310
Jackie Yeah, I have a different no, I feel like historically, like, yeah.

240
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:11,120
Like not just in the type of foods that members want to hold, but also within their goals like are some have the more acceptable.

241
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:27,370
Yeah. And why do you think that is? Um, I think because like the society that is like stronger and like, more like, yeah,

242
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:34,910
stronger and perhaps more rational, logical or less emotional, I guess like that I can hear what you know.

243
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:39,690
Okay. I was going to say that, I guess. Was like the same line.

244
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:43,360
Like gender expectations, like. It's more. Okay.

245
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:50,750
Because a better life has more characteristics that are considerably.

246
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:56,800
Yeah. And like, that's what I like.

247
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:02,290
It's not as positive as new things. Yeah.

248
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,500
Jackie, I feel like the.

249
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:16,540
And like especially. School.

250
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:23,560
Work it. Few more here.

251
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:33,750
And as a result, they're just not. It cannot be over that it affects that career.

252
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:39,180
Kind of career. Yeah. Yeah. I read an article a few years ago about.

253
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:59,630
How sleeper? Just the it.

254
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:05,140
Yeah. Yeah. Which has these late dynamic implications.

255
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:14,990
Career implications. Yeah. Yes.

256
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:37,390
Yeah. There's some work on women being expected to plan the birthday parties and things like that.

257
00:38:37,430 --> 00:39:01,980
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

258
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:07,980
So the same behaviors or personality characteristics use different.

259
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:16,300
I mean, I think you see this all the time in political campaigning.

260
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:26,590
And that way it can be really hard for women candidates because there is this expectation that you be strong, right.

261
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:29,950
As a political leader, but you can't be shrill.

262
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:42,370
And so I think if you remember, you know, Hillary Clinton got this probably harder than anybody if you think back historically.

263
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:46,030
And I'm not saying that I'm not making a comment on Hillary Clinton,

264
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:52,420
but I'm just saying that it was something that really like was very visible with her in particular,

265
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:55,870
probably because she was like the highest profile woman running for office.

266
00:39:57,220 --> 00:40:09,730
But yeah, it's like that's definitely true that the way the way that women are allowed to lead is different than the way that men are allowed to lead.

267
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:19,180
Yeah. So there's all kinds of differences here that we think about within the family context.

268
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:25,900
You know, this idea that women should be caregivers or match like natural caregivers.

269
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:29,830
Um, you know, we didn't talk about this as much.

270
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:35,380
I think this is shifting a little bit, but this historical idea of men being providers,

271
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:41,830
so men's role is to provide financially for the family, women's role is to provide sort of an emotionally.

272
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:49,780
Um, and this of course has, you know, affects labor force participation, which has economic consequences.

273
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:58,570
We talked about this a little bit. When you decision making, there's this kind of stereotypes about women as more emotional men is more rational.

274
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,300
This, of course, has implications for all sorts of things.

275
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:09,230
And we talked about expectations for appearance. So some of it is just about what are women supposed to look like.

276
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:16,360
But in, you know, like women wear makeup, women wear dresses, men wear pants, silly things like that.

277
00:41:16,370 --> 00:41:20,449
Right. But then also as Frances, that was you saying.

278
00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:20,870
That's right.

279
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:31,160
But like, not only are there different expectations for physical appearance, but but men and women are held to those standards to a different degree.

280
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:37,040
Yeah. Okay. Oh, so I have a little question on here.

281
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:43,310
Measurement. So how would we. Okay. You're an epidemiologist and you're interested in gender.

282
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:58,660
How are you going to measure that? You can think about it.

283
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:03,750
And we'll we'll we'll go to the next thing and then maybe it will help.

284
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:09,630
All right. So, Frances, I think you mentioned this, this idea of gender identity.

285
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:19,410
And so this is about a person's perception of their gender. It may or may not correspond to biological sex.

286
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:27,280
And so people may identify as a man or a woman?

287
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:30,489
Both. Neither. There could be different ways of identifying.

288
00:42:30,490 --> 00:42:35,890
So you start to see and studies some questions, like I said, about gender identity.

289
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:50,190
And so, you know, like we said before, when we were talking about the size of the transgender and non-binary population in the US,

290
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:56,460
most people in the US identify as a man or a woman. Others may identify as both or neither.

291
00:43:01,510 --> 00:43:03,430
And I know you already know this, and I'm just going to say it.

292
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:08,470
People whose gender identity matches the sex they were assigned at birth are referred to as cisgender.

293
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:15,070
The term transgender is used to describe people whose biological sex doesn't align with their gender identity.

294
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:20,530
And people who are transgender may be referred to as gender minorities.

295
00:43:23,110 --> 00:43:32,620
And it's estimated that about 0.6 percent of the population aged 13 and over in the US identify as a gender minority,

296
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:37,010
and that is data from 2017 to 2020. So this is pretty recent.

297
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:50,860
And so then I want to point out here that a lot of times in the literature, gender and sexual minorities are lumped together.

298
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:56,110
So you get this like LGBT health kind of thing.

299
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:05,500
But gender and sexuality aren't the same thing. And so people who are transgender may or may not also be sexual minorities,

300
00:44:06,070 --> 00:44:11,320
but because the mechanism underlying gender and sexual minority health disparities tend to be similar,

301
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:16,820
then I put transgender help next week with sexual minorities.

302
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:20,260
So sexual and gender minority health next week.

303
00:44:20,530 --> 00:44:23,620
It's an artificial distinction, but that's why.

304
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:32,920
So like for kind of the rest of this lecture, we're really thinking about cisgender populations.

305
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:45,440
But again, I think and I feel like a couple of you brought this up in your comments.

306
00:44:48,590 --> 00:44:55,430
To go back to my previous question about measuring gender and thinking about gender in epidemiologic research.

307
00:44:58,230 --> 00:45:03,450
Understanding transgender health can help inform that, right?

308
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:15,330
Okay. So let's talk a little bit about the gender.

309
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:28,190
So this refers to the overall structure of power relationships between gender groups and society.

310
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:36,120
So we're getting back to that idea of social stratification like we talked about with socioeconomic status,

311
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:44,290
as we talked about with race and ethnicity. There's also this hierarchical structure around gender.

312
00:45:45,670 --> 00:45:49,910
And so you could imagine a gender order that's egalitarian.

313
00:45:49,930 --> 00:45:58,700
What might that look like? I see several of you laughing because you can't imagine it.

314
00:45:59,870 --> 00:46:14,090
But what made it look like? Yeah.

315
00:46:14,930 --> 00:46:27,780
Know exactly. So like expectations around things like child care and all these things like wouldn't actually vary for women and men.

316
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:31,750
They might be the same. Yeah.

317
00:46:34,670 --> 00:46:38,149
Okay. Yeah. So there might be an equal balance of power.

318
00:46:38,150 --> 00:46:41,950
We might have had, you know, 50% of the US presidents might have been women.

319
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:54,769
Something like that. Right? Like political representation may not be so unfair in the leadership of corporate boards, may not be so uneven.

320
00:46:54,770 --> 00:47:08,009
CEOs, other things, right? So you could have you could have an egalitarian gender order, another type you could have as patriarchal.

321
00:47:08,010 --> 00:47:20,380
And what would a patriarchal gender order look like? This is one of you?

322
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:24,280
Yeah, this one. It would look like. It would look like this. Yeah.

323
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:31,930
So in patriarchal society, like the US, men tend to have more power and higher social status than women.

324
00:47:31,930 --> 00:47:37,389
And this gets reflected in things like the gender pay gap, the sexual double standard,

325
00:47:37,390 --> 00:47:40,560
which we didn't talk about before, which is still alive and well.

326
00:47:40,570 --> 00:47:43,960
Having a high school student, I hear all about it.

327
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:49,150
Um, commentary on how girls dress and things like that.

328
00:47:49,150 --> 00:47:57,190
I'm like, Oh, let's talk about that and the underrepresentation of women in elected office as we talked about.

329
00:47:57,190 --> 00:48:01,959
So these are kind of ways that we can observe the effects of patriarchy.

330
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:08,230
I think we also saw I'm just remembering we're talking about this before this whole idea of women caring for children.

331
00:48:08,230 --> 00:48:16,959
I think before the pandemic, there was a little bit of an idea out there that within heterosexual partnerships

332
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:21,390
they'd become more egalitarian with respect to like childcare and things like that.

333
00:48:22,390 --> 00:48:24,820
And then the pandemic happened and what did we see?

334
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:38,110
Like women quitting their jobs because they had to like do the the home, like watch the kids, do their school from home or whatever.

335
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:39,709
Like it was pretty intense,

336
00:48:39,710 --> 00:48:50,150
like the amount of women who left the labor force during the pandemic because they suddenly had 100% responsibility for caring for their kids.

337
00:48:51,260 --> 00:49:01,500
And so you can see that like what was really making it look more egalitarian was the presence of third party childcare.

338
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:07,940
Right? Like having daycare or having school was kind of creating this illusion of greater equality.

339
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:15,650
Um, and then when that was gone, it just, it like reverted back pretty quickly to these expectations for women and men.

340
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:23,630
All right. So let's talk about sex, gender and health.

341
00:49:25,310 --> 00:49:36,130
And, you know, this kind of brings us to that Krieger article that had all the little digs in there thinking about, you know, is it sex, is it gender?

342
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:43,070
Is it the interaction? Is it both? So let's think about that in the context of understanding health.

343
00:49:43,070 --> 00:49:50,900
So first, are sex and gender related? Or are these two like totally distinct concepts?

344
00:50:01,150 --> 00:50:04,490
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

345
00:50:04,510 --> 00:50:06,340
They correlate it really highly. Right.

346
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:14,650
And so what happens when you have two things that are almost perfectly correlated and you want to study them in a regression model?

347
00:50:20,230 --> 00:50:24,430
I'm sorry, but you cannot have write, right? You can't do it.

348
00:50:24,850 --> 00:50:30,080
Okay, so that's one thing. So they sort of they're very highly correlated.

349
00:50:30,090 --> 00:50:38,620
So they tend to overlap. People with female bodies are more likely to act in feminine ways or to identify as a woman.

350
00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:47,980
Gender kind of helps exaggerate natural differences.

351
00:50:47,990 --> 00:50:55,010
So any biological, natural kinds of differences and things like the ability to build muscle,

352
00:50:55,670 --> 00:51:02,330
write gender norms laid on top of that help exaggerate those differences.

353
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:10,580
So like, just don't even think about it for a minute. And without thinking, what kind of exercise do women do and what kind of exercise?

354
00:51:10,910 --> 00:51:16,700
Do you picture the gym? What are women doing in wonderment doing?

355
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:20,960
Yeah, I think you. Yeah.

356
00:51:21,150 --> 00:51:25,400
So women are in a lot of classes. What are the men? They're weightlifting.

357
00:51:25,410 --> 00:51:31,430
Yeah. Go to any gym like, you know, you may see some people, you may see some women lifting weights.

358
00:51:31,430 --> 00:51:37,010
I think there's there's more kind of health information out there now, but it is important for women to lift weights and things like that.

359
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:42,260
But there's very different kind of ways that women and men tend to exercise.

360
00:51:42,530 --> 00:51:48,980
And those types of exercise kind of exaggerate differences in the bodies of women in.

361
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:57,360
I had a student several years ago who was like, Yeah, I used to love to rock climb this a woman.

362
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:05,700
And she was like, but I started getting like so muscular here that I stopped doing it, you know?

363
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:14,909
So, so. So there's these ways that gender norms and expectations can even further shape what might be,

364
00:52:14,910 --> 00:52:19,500
at least initially, some natural biological differences between the two women's bodies.

365
00:52:20,210 --> 00:52:29,120
Um, this is also the case. There's some really interesting work about like testosterone and aggression.

366
00:52:29,130 --> 00:52:34,170
So there used to be this idea that like testosterone causes aggression or whatever.

367
00:52:34,290 --> 00:52:42,330
Maybe there's some reality of that. But we also know that like when people engage in sports, that it increases their testosterone.

368
00:52:42,790 --> 00:52:45,419
So there's this kind of like feedback thing.

369
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:51,389
So if you engage in a more kind of like active and aggressive behavior, it decreases testosterone, whether you're a man or a woman.

370
00:52:51,390 --> 00:52:55,080
So. So there's these kind of like feedback things there, too.

371
00:52:55,820 --> 00:52:59,180
Um, we've also we've talked about this too, right? So these,

372
00:52:59,190 --> 00:53:04,319
these reproductive differences that we think about as being related to sex lead to these

373
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:09,570
really big social and economic differences that we might think of as being part of gender.

374
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:13,440
So they very much are related to one another.

375
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:25,400
Okay. So if we try to separate them out. Do we think that sex effects help these biological kind of things?

376
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:30,620
Yes. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely.

377
00:53:30,620 --> 00:53:54,210
So. So what are some ways the sex might affect how? Yeah.

378
00:54:13,340 --> 00:54:16,850
That means differences in distribution in the body.

379
00:54:17,150 --> 00:54:23,990
That has implications for different health professionals, whether we play around with more social.

380
00:54:29,790 --> 00:54:36,490
Yeah. Pregnancy related.

381
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:42,070
Yeah. Absolutely. So. So, like, women can be pregnant.

382
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:46,870
Right. And pregnancy is so easy with all kinds of things.

383
00:54:49,150 --> 00:54:53,200
I'm working productive for competitions like this.

384
00:54:55,780 --> 00:54:58,899
Yeah, absolutely. So breast cancer, testicular cancer,

385
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:05,080
uterine cancer are different aspects of like the reproductive system can be related to different kinds of diseases.

386
00:55:05,170 --> 00:55:09,010
So yeah, there are definitely ways that, that sex impacts health.

387
00:55:09,010 --> 00:55:11,250
So diseases of the reproductive system.

388
00:55:11,260 --> 00:55:20,200
We didn't talk about X-linked conditions so things like colorblindness or hemophilia like because are related to sex chromosomes.

389
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:25,000
Um, also we talked a little bit about hormones.

390
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:34,959
There are kind of differences, particularly during the reproductive years and levels of some sex steroids that do have implications for health,

391
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:39,010
although, you know, we don't understand them as well as some people claim.

392
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:48,220
But, but we do know that things like estrogen and testosterone do have implications for health.

393
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:54,270
All right. So we know that sex affects how. What about gender?

394
00:55:55,980 --> 00:55:59,590
These socially constructed differences. Do these things have implications for health?

395
00:56:00,750 --> 00:56:05,020
Yeah. Okay?

396
00:56:05,170 --> 00:56:17,760
Yeah. Especially.

397
00:56:28,820 --> 00:56:31,000
Yeah. Yeah.

398
00:56:31,050 --> 00:56:40,810
So as one example of differences in eating disorders because of differences in the sort of expectations for appearance for boys and girls from.

399
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:31,890
Yeah. So there's been this kind of implications for mental health, particularly if you don't perform to to sort of the gender norms or expectations.

400
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:40,850
Yeah. Yeah.

401
00:57:42,140 --> 00:57:45,450
Yeah. Yeah.

402
00:57:45,450 --> 00:57:51,390
So differences related to gender within the health care system and those interactions can also have implications for health.

403
00:57:51,930 --> 00:57:59,249
Yeah, absolutely. We also have material deprivation of women.

404
00:57:59,250 --> 00:58:08,610
So if you think about differences in income and wealth and things like that, that as we know from our learning about socioeconomic status and health,

405
00:58:08,610 --> 00:58:13,889
those can have impacts on how the failure of health professionals to take women's

406
00:58:13,890 --> 00:58:19,830
complaints sincerely or to recognize certain symptoms in women or in men.

407
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:27,989
So, um, you know, there's a long history of, of doctors and others not recognizing symptoms of heart disease in women.

408
00:58:27,990 --> 00:58:32,010
And so there's been big campaigns around that to try to increase awareness of it.

409
00:58:32,850 --> 00:58:38,190
Also work to help health care providers recognize depression in men are symptoms

410
00:58:38,190 --> 00:58:41,850
of depression in men because that was more seen as like a woman's disorder.

411
00:58:42,810 --> 00:58:47,370
Um, we also, you know, the Courtney article talks about this a lot, right?

412
00:58:47,370 --> 00:58:53,460
But the sort of the health promoting and the health damaging aspects of doing gender or performing gender.

413
00:58:53,850 --> 00:58:59,700
So masculinity is associated with increased risk behavior, decreased care seeking behavior.

414
00:59:00,510 --> 00:59:05,820
And then femininity, on the other hand, appears to decrease risky behavior and increased care seeking behavior.

415
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,640
So these things have implications for the health of women and men.

416
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:20,940
So then the unanswerable question, which has a bigger effect on how sex or gender minority told you it's not the answer,

417
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:26,820
but you can just think about it a little bit. Is it even a reasonable question to ask?

418
00:59:31,010 --> 00:59:39,840
Nikki, you say no? Yeah. And how could we use them apart anyway?

419
00:59:40,290 --> 00:59:44,100
It would be really challenging to completely tease these apart.

420
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:56,510
And I think the thing that I really like about the Krieger paper is what she's saying is depends on your research question too.

421
00:59:56,520 --> 01:00:02,280
Like you need to think about this in the context of what your study, what is your exposure or what is your outcome.

422
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:09,990
Try not to think about it in this very broad, general way because it's probably going to be very specific.

423
01:00:10,380 --> 01:00:15,900
So like the condition that you're studying or that the particular context that you're studying,

424
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:19,140
like even the age group that you're studying, it could take it very.

425
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:29,770
But I think the sort of take home point here and that Krieger makes also is that sex and gender aren't interchangeable.

426
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:35,620
But we but we treat them that way. Oftentimes in epidemiologic studies.

427
01:00:47,090 --> 01:00:52,880
So now I want to talk a little bit about what we know about gender differences in health.

428
01:00:53,660 --> 01:01:00,050
And so there's this idea out there called the gender paradox, and it's this idea that women are sicker, but men died quicker.

429
01:01:02,060 --> 01:01:12,300
It's just catchy. So the idea that women have greater morbidity than men have greater mortality.

430
01:01:12,810 --> 01:01:20,840
And so I want to talk about I want to kind of go through some data and say, is this conventional wisdom correct?

431
01:01:20,850 --> 01:01:30,710
Is it right that my money is the government mandate, but. All right.

432
01:01:31,610 --> 01:01:35,060
That's probably 100% impossible for you to see.

433
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:42,469
Right now, I will try to describe it. Okay. So I started using sex, gender instead of gender.

434
01:01:42,470 --> 01:01:45,500
Just you to note that I cannot distinguish these.

435
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:49,550
I don't know which it is. Probably some combination of both. But we talked about that.

436
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:55,810
So this is sex was. There.

437
01:01:55,830 --> 01:02:06,090
That's better, at least. Okay. So this is the life expectancy of women versus the life expectancy of men in 2015 for a whole bunch of countries.

438
01:02:07,470 --> 01:02:16,650
And anything that is above this gray line, any doc that's above this great line, the life expectancy of women is higher than for men.

439
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:25,200
And this is life expectancy at birth. So I don't know if you can see this, but there's no dots below the line.

440
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:39,640
That's kind of the take home of that. But you can see that it's also not the case that there's a single straight line for all of the countries.

441
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:47,000
There's like there's variation across the country. So the size of the gap varies across place.

442
01:02:54,690 --> 01:03:01,500
So what do you think this means in the context of thinking about sex and gender and how?

443
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:16,440
Does this suggest a role for biology?

444
01:03:38,050 --> 01:04:01,390
Yeah. Mikayla. Yeah.

445
01:04:01,750 --> 01:04:05,020
You're not sure about all of that socially?

446
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:11,260
You can be driven by occupational. In all of the country.

447
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:21,649
I mean, I do think that the fact that the size of the gap, the fact that it varies across countries,

448
01:04:21,650 --> 01:04:25,590
suggests an important role for for gender and for social context.

449
01:04:25,590 --> 01:04:35,780
So like the lowest difference in life expectancy is just six months in Bhutan, but it's ten years in Russia.

450
01:04:36,830 --> 01:04:41,960
Women live longer. Women live ten years longer than men in Russia in 2015.

451
01:04:42,830 --> 01:04:49,100
Right. So that is suggesting that there's something very different probably within these

452
01:04:49,100 --> 01:04:53,960
different social context that is related to gender and probably not to sex.

453
01:04:54,380 --> 01:05:01,710
But the fact that women outlive men everywhere in the world says that there's probably something biological going on, too.

454
01:05:01,730 --> 01:05:04,799
It's just it's hard to distinguish how much of it is biological. Yes.

455
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:15,770
There. Yes. This is life expectancy in 2015.

456
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:32,010
Yeah. So I there was a question about this last year and I have the answer.

457
01:05:32,010 --> 01:05:33,569
I can't remember the second thought.

458
01:05:33,570 --> 01:05:42,209
I will share with you guys how they calculate life expectancy, but we know right now that because of COVID, life expectancy has decreased.

459
01:05:42,210 --> 01:05:53,370
Right? So they're using it. They're like they're using agent death data at different times to estimate average life expectancy.

460
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:59,360
So it's like. Yeah.

461
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:07,819
It's like so it's like usually this is how long a boy who was born in this year can expect to live.

462
01:06:07,820 --> 01:06:13,370
And it's based on, like, the three. But I can assure you the actual population.

463
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:24,770
But yeah, you can see the light here. This is like the average life expectancy of the community.

464
01:06:25,370 --> 01:06:29,600
So, like, this is Japan, South Korea, the United States is here.

465
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:32,930
And then this is where your average life expectancy is, around 50.

466
01:06:33,110 --> 01:06:35,020
So like Nigeria, Sierra Leone.

467
01:06:35,030 --> 01:06:43,190
So you can also see that there's really big differences across the world and average life expectancy that's tied to economic condition.

468
01:06:43,580 --> 01:06:52,130
But within those places like women and parents, mortality is correlated for life expectancy with mortality.

469
01:06:53,160 --> 01:06:58,080
Life expectancy is poor, but the women in all the places have higher.

470
01:06:59,710 --> 01:07:06,270
But these are places, places that are further from the line or where there's a bigger difference between women and men.

471
01:07:12,870 --> 01:07:24,260
I'm about to show you one of my flashlight. Oh, for like five centuries.

472
01:07:24,310 --> 01:07:30,389
Yeah, that would be super interesting. Well, no, we probably don't have about that long.

473
01:07:30,390 --> 01:07:35,250
But they do have. Going back to 1790.

474
01:07:35,790 --> 01:07:40,770
Okay. Life expectancy at birth in the United States for women and men.

475
01:07:44,230 --> 01:07:48,370
So differences in life expectancy also vary across time.

476
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:54,910
So this figure shows life expectancy for women and men in the US from 1790 to 2014.

477
01:07:55,810 --> 01:07:59,560
And so what do you notice when you look at this figure? Females are inbred males.

478
01:08:12,220 --> 01:08:16,420
Okay. Okay. Yeah.

479
01:08:17,830 --> 01:08:37,280
Because of my industrial war with that. And there'll be another one because you can't really forget that.

480
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:42,260
Then I remember the job here. Oh, yeah.

481
01:08:42,470 --> 01:08:49,490
And then, you know, we'll have we'll have a there's a covered one or it goes for trial, but then it recovers.

482
01:08:51,380 --> 01:08:57,620
But it temporarily drops like that. What else do you notice here?

483
01:08:59,860 --> 01:09:05,080
On average, it's like going, Huh? So we're living longer, except for whatever we've got this year.

484
01:09:08,990 --> 01:09:12,710
What do you notice about this trend over here?

485
01:09:26,390 --> 01:09:30,830
There are fewer, but I'm talking about the fact that the lines completely overlap.

486
01:09:30,830 --> 01:09:38,180
Right. So it's like there's no difference between women and men and life expectancy in these early years.

487
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:50,690
And then you start to see a divergence around, you know, your Irish in the 20th and the starting in the 20th century, women start to outlive men.

488
01:09:51,380 --> 01:09:59,870
And this difference kind of gets bigger. And then in more recent years and it's even more dramatic now, but it's starting to narrow again.

489
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:04,330
You know, give a is it.

490
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:18,100
And. That's a good question.

491
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:24,190
I mean, from this mortality database and others.

492
01:10:26,210 --> 01:10:30,160
I don't know. It would depend on the extent to which just record.

493
01:10:30,170 --> 01:10:37,040
I mean, I imagine that there were issues with death records not being available for everyone in the population,

494
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:40,980
whereas like today, we would have death records for everyone.

495
01:10:41,090 --> 01:10:49,590
So yeah, it could be that like the data quality is poor and the data are less in those earlier years for particular groups.

496
01:10:49,610 --> 01:10:55,819
I mean, I would imagine that would also apply not just by racial categories but also like geographically,

497
01:10:55,820 --> 01:10:59,540
like I would imagine the records were not as good in rural areas as urban areas.

498
01:10:59,870 --> 01:11:08,270
Things like that. Yeah.

499
01:11:08,440 --> 01:11:13,610
So what do you think? What do you think happened here to derive these differences?

500
01:11:13,630 --> 01:11:18,459
Yeah. Olivia, I wonder about, like, gender norms for occupational hazard.

501
01:11:18,460 --> 01:11:18,970
It's like,

502
01:11:19,240 --> 01:11:29,590
here's an 18th century kind of woman that mixed life with everybody kind of was doing a lot of similar type of labor outside and really difficult.

503
01:11:29,590 --> 01:11:33,630
And then you had, like, industrial revolution and. Typically men are going to be.

504
01:11:34,420 --> 01:11:41,740
Usually more involved in those really hard labor type jobs. Also wondering about modernization of health care and women not dying.

505
01:11:41,830 --> 01:11:45,010
Oh yeah. For sure. Yeah.

506
01:11:45,010 --> 01:11:48,400
That getting a little bit better? Yeah. Maternal mortality.

507
01:11:48,410 --> 01:11:53,550
Yeah, definitely. Like going way down and sort of contributing to.

508
01:11:54,130 --> 01:12:05,380
There's also a lot of this is due to smoking and that part of why it's starting to come back together because women's.

509
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:12,969
Women are doing worse. So it used to be and in a lot of places in the world, that still is the case.

510
01:12:12,970 --> 01:12:18,160
There are huge gender differences in smoking, but not so much in the US anymore.

511
01:12:18,160 --> 01:12:26,170
And so that historically through the 20th century contributed a lot to differences between men and women and life expectancy,

512
01:12:26,170 --> 01:12:28,330
but is less, less relevant now.

513
01:12:29,890 --> 01:12:38,400
So, you know, I think what these kind of trends show us is that there is definitely some combination of biological and environmental factors at play.

514
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:48,579
But it is very clear from this data and the data before that men men die earlier than women on average.

515
01:12:48,580 --> 01:12:55,300
So this idea from the paradox that men die quicker is pretty well supported by the data, at least at this point in time.

516
01:12:57,670 --> 01:13:04,090
So then another then there's ways that we can think about gender differences in health and morbidity.

517
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:09,270
And so one of the things we can look at is differences in healthy life expectancy.

518
01:13:12,940 --> 01:13:17,260
And so this data comes from the World Health Organization, World Health Report.

519
01:13:17,740 --> 01:13:22,660
It's a measure of life expectancy adjusting for illness and disability.

520
01:13:23,500 --> 01:13:33,220
So it's like you're kind of reading about life expectancy by how much illness and disability people experience.

521
01:13:36,870 --> 01:13:45,270
And so they looked at 192 member countries and found that healthy life expectancy was higher for women in nine out of ten countries worldwide.

522
01:13:51,020 --> 01:14:00,860
So from the 2015 data, healthy life expectancy was three years greater for women than men, whereas life expectancy overall was five years greater.

523
01:14:01,670 --> 01:14:11,120
So the idea here is that once you account for greater illness and disability among women, the life expectancy difference gets smaller.

524
01:14:18,930 --> 01:14:22,990
But do you have? This is a leading question.

525
01:14:24,510 --> 01:14:29,880
So I'm just going to do it because I already started. Do you have any objections to healthy life expectancy?

526
01:14:31,310 --> 01:14:38,030
Zeta or do you think that's do you think there's any limitations to a measure of healthy life expectancy?

527
01:14:48,250 --> 01:15:09,340
Yeah. Mikayla. Yeah.

528
01:15:09,340 --> 01:15:13,060
So maybe since the whole premise of living longer better.

529
01:15:14,810 --> 01:15:19,000
If it's something that you requested to do.

530
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:57,440
Or were you thinking about that? Yeah.

531
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:10,020
For example, we all have concerns about, you know, are more severe than our.

532
01:16:13,190 --> 01:16:17,370
But if I don't know how the American public if categorize.

533
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:23,370
And the is that it will be more appropriate maybe.

534
01:16:23,910 --> 01:16:28,410
Yeah. They have to, they have to create the ways for it somehow.

535
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:37,589
Right. So you would have to if you wanted to do this, you'd have to make a list of every disability and every illness that people could have.

536
01:16:37,590 --> 01:16:43,860
And you'd have to assign a value to it that corresponds to like healthy years.

537
01:16:44,250 --> 01:16:53,549
So like you're saying that it could be like if you have cancer that subtracts to you subtract two years from the life expectancy.

538
01:16:53,550 --> 01:16:56,910
If you have arthritis, you subtract two months.

539
01:16:57,750 --> 01:17:02,970
Right. And so there's a lot of subjectivity in that.

540
01:17:03,900 --> 01:17:10,190
People have counted on this. But I've always taken issue with how it sort of translates into.

541
01:17:12,550 --> 01:17:15,820
Sort of measure to save people's lives. Celeste? Yeah.

542
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:20,440
Yeah, absolutely. Numerically less life. Which is not.

543
01:17:21,580 --> 01:17:29,200
Yeah. Yeah. Cause you're assigning a category to disability, assuming that is that, like,

544
01:17:29,260 --> 01:17:36,760
whatever you're classifying as a disability is less life or less valuable life.

545
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:43,090
Yea. Yea, yea.

546
01:17:46,640 --> 01:18:02,230
Of course. But you. That's true.

547
01:18:03,490 --> 01:18:07,880
Say it again. What is your address?

548
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:17,870
Yeah. If you're just. Oh, yeah.

549
01:18:17,890 --> 01:18:21,820
So if you. So that would really only be a problem.

550
01:18:21,820 --> 01:18:31,360
I think if that variation, if there was like genetic variation for women and men, which there could be for things that are like sex linked conditions.

551
01:18:31,750 --> 01:18:35,920
But for other types of conditions, there wouldn't necessarily be.

552
01:18:37,210 --> 01:18:42,670
But yeah, that that could be kind of like a problematic component of it.

553
01:18:43,060 --> 01:18:48,610
Yeah. I mean, I think it's one of those things like trying to measure stress and trying to quantify people's

554
01:18:48,610 --> 01:18:55,989
stress burden by like researchers deciding what are stressors and how stressful are they.

555
01:18:55,990 --> 01:18:58,920
And we can like quantify people's stress.

556
01:18:58,930 --> 01:19:05,889
It's like there's just a lot of decisions, arbitrary and otherwise, that get made when calculating this kind of thing.

557
01:19:05,890 --> 01:19:14,620
And so I think you just have to take it with a grain of salt that like if you had 100 different people creating a measure of healthy life expectancy,

558
01:19:14,620 --> 01:19:21,700
you could have 100 different like values on it because the way that you construct it is going to influence the results that you get.

559
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:32,410
So if I have a bias where I assign a higher value to conditions that are more common among men or something.

560
01:19:34,310 --> 01:19:41,090
That's going to affect what the what the outcome looks like. All right.

561
01:19:41,540 --> 01:19:50,390
So Self-Rated health is another way that we can try to kind of look to understand, are there like these overall sex and gender differences in health?

562
01:19:50,810 --> 01:19:55,670
And we know that gender differences in self-rated health vary a lot across countries.

563
01:19:56,060 --> 01:19:59,090
A lot of studies in the U.S. today find no difference.

564
01:20:00,530 --> 01:20:04,290
But in the bulk of the studies, women report worse home than men.

565
01:20:11,210 --> 01:20:19,130
And what makes this even a little more complicated is the self-rated health appears to be a better predictor of mortality for men than for women.

566
01:20:20,240 --> 01:20:29,120
So it may not necessarily be like if we're trying to compare the health of women and men, it may not be the best, best measure to use,

567
01:20:29,480 --> 01:20:36,380
because it appears that there's like something when when we ask women and men about their health,

568
01:20:36,860 --> 01:20:40,460
they're taking into account different things in a way.

569
01:20:43,390 --> 01:20:50,200
So it's a self-rated health as a good measure for comparing people that have similar understandings or ways of assessing health.

570
01:20:50,200 --> 01:20:53,020
But if there's differences in that, it becomes difficult.

571
01:20:53,030 --> 01:20:58,440
So we also know that, like, it's really hard to compare self-rated health across different cultural context.

572
01:20:58,450 --> 01:21:02,710
Like if you're looking across countries, it doesn't make a lot of sense to compare Self-Rated health,

573
01:21:05,080 --> 01:21:07,270
and that appears to be kind of the same for women and men.

574
01:21:08,980 --> 01:21:17,320
Now, in terms of health services utilization, there's no doubt that women use more health services than men.

575
01:21:17,740 --> 01:21:22,180
So women have more primary care visits, more emergency room visits.

576
01:21:22,180 --> 01:21:26,200
And this is even after removing visits that are for reproductive health.

577
01:21:26,770 --> 01:21:33,970
So women utilize health care much, much more than men in the U.S. Women also take more prescriptions.

578
01:21:37,390 --> 01:21:46,360
Do you think that this means that women are sicker than men? But he really.

579
01:21:46,510 --> 01:21:51,250
No way. Walk us through that.

580
01:21:52,630 --> 01:22:02,170
Well, because we talked about not Stephen Cares last year, but then I thought about it.

581
01:22:02,650 --> 01:22:06,070
I actually don't know the data. Yeah. Earlier in the class he said like.

582
01:22:07,050 --> 01:22:10,730
Mm. Yeah.

583
01:22:10,730 --> 01:22:15,200
And this is like some of the evidence that's used to support the idea that women are sicker.

584
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:18,379
It's like, well, they go to the doctor more. You go to the doctor when you're sick.

585
01:22:18,380 --> 01:22:21,530
Therefore, women are sicker, however.

586
01:22:22,040 --> 01:22:32,240
Right? Like if, you know, if part of performing your gender is that you don't go to the doctor, doesn't necessarily mean that you weren't sick.

587
01:22:32,250 --> 01:22:38,510
Right. So. So this this data, you know, you could interpret it different ways, right?

588
01:22:39,140 --> 01:22:48,290
If we look at sex and gender and sex, gender differences in specific conditions, we do see patterns here about these specific conditions.

589
01:22:49,340 --> 01:22:55,610
So women tend to report more chronic non-life threatening conditions.

590
01:22:56,240 --> 01:23:03,710
Um, things like migraine anemia, gallbladder disease, osteoporosis.

591
01:23:05,180 --> 01:23:11,540
Um. Whereas men tend to report more.

592
01:23:15,540 --> 01:23:19,970
Life threatening conditions like coronary heart disease, cirrhosis of the liver or.

593
01:23:27,270 --> 01:23:31,610
Yeah. Yeah, I.

594
01:23:46,990 --> 01:23:51,420
But like. The.

595
01:24:04,430 --> 01:24:09,800
And that's what the healthy life expectancy thing is supposed to begin to look like now.

596
01:24:11,050 --> 01:24:19,060
But. Yeah. I have another thought. Yeah. I mean, I don't know if I can say this despite not having enough time.

597
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:29,300
Yeah. So, like, you know, my first thought when you asked the women second I shook my head was because, like I said, like health care is a massive.

598
01:24:31,040 --> 01:24:36,169
Yeah, but there's also an argument for liking something when they have a really long

599
01:24:36,170 --> 01:24:39,710
history of being neglected and ignored and not just believed by doctors.

600
01:24:39,830 --> 01:24:49,430
Yeah. So it's sort of an argument that we see in the data that like utilize health care for like, you know, our stating that they are.

601
01:24:49,490 --> 01:24:53,750
Yeah. So maybe we should actually believe that there's something there, you know.

602
01:24:54,170 --> 01:25:00,139
Yeah. And there's also like, have you noticed this report, right?

603
01:25:00,140 --> 01:25:06,470
Because a lot of this data comes from like the National Health Interview Survey purpose.

604
01:25:06,500 --> 01:25:11,990
These like kind of large surveys where we ask people to self-report these kinds of things.

605
01:25:12,500 --> 01:25:19,790
And so access to health care influences, whether, you know, that you have these conditions,

606
01:25:20,180 --> 01:25:23,870
discrimination or bias in the health care system can influence whether we.

607
01:25:23,870 --> 01:25:31,510
Right. Because we have pioneering heart disease here. But I just told you that doctors under-recognised symptoms of heart disease and so so.

608
01:25:38,850 --> 01:25:43,690
If you have. Yeah.

609
01:25:47,770 --> 01:25:51,400
Yeah. So I think that's why. I mean.

610
01:25:57,610 --> 01:26:00,850
Because the more. Works for.

611
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:08,540
Yeah, right. Because if you don't before you have this, you probably have hypertension.

612
01:26:08,540 --> 01:26:13,330
But if you didn't go to the doctor and it wasn't diagnosed, you don't you don't know you have hypertension.

613
01:26:13,370 --> 01:26:25,130
Like you can't feel like. Yeah, for sure.

614
01:26:26,010 --> 01:26:31,620
Yeah. I know this. Yeah.

615
01:26:42,660 --> 01:26:53,570
Yeah. And homicides. Even so you can think about ways, but like men don't live as long as women to still be at risk for developing some of these,

616
01:26:53,620 --> 01:26:59,800
like chronic non-life threatening conditions because they're diseases of aging that we don't know yet.

617
01:27:01,180 --> 01:27:07,390
Yeah. So it's but kind of the conclusion from this.

618
01:27:08,050 --> 01:27:14,890
Um, but again data quality not perfect, right, for looking at this kind of stuff.

619
01:27:15,790 --> 01:27:21,099
But overall, it's not that there's big differences in the level of chronic illness,

620
01:27:21,100 --> 01:27:25,840
but there tend to be different types of conditions that predominate for women versus men.

621
01:27:28,540 --> 01:27:38,740
And like you said, there some are some are related to quality of life and some to quality of life in these ways that like,

622
01:27:40,360 --> 01:27:49,800
in fact, what we see for differences in mortality. So then the question is, do we really have a gender paradox?

623
01:27:49,830 --> 01:27:53,610
So do men really die quicker? Yes, they do.

624
01:27:54,090 --> 01:28:03,030
We can see that. That's the nice thing about mortality data is that it's just, you know, you died or you didn't.

625
01:28:03,660 --> 01:28:07,080
Whereas, like, morbidity data is really difficult.

626
01:28:08,160 --> 01:28:17,430
Are women really sicker? The healthy life expectancy data maybe refute this somewhat because it concludes that women still live longer,

627
01:28:17,430 --> 01:28:27,290
even after adjusting for disability and illness. But it also says that women do lose more years than men to disability, disability or illness.

628
01:28:27,300 --> 01:28:34,320
And we already talked about ways in which this is problematic, both philosophically and methodologically.

629
01:28:36,820 --> 01:28:42,610
Self-Rated how some studies support the idea that women are sicker but others refuted.

630
01:28:43,030 --> 01:28:47,680
It does seem to fit the paradox better than the data for a healthy life expectancy.

631
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:53,290
Health Services Data supports the idea that women are sicker.

632
01:28:53,320 --> 01:29:02,440
If you kind of buy into the premise that people utilize health care when they're sick and everyone equally utilizes health care when they're sick,

633
01:29:03,490 --> 01:29:06,400
but as we've said, that's probably not true.

634
01:29:07,690 --> 01:29:13,569
And then for the specific conditions, it refutes it somewhat, because I'm saying that really there's similar levels of illness.

635
01:29:13,570 --> 01:29:16,450
There's just different different types of conditions.

636
01:29:18,180 --> 01:29:25,260
And so the thing that I want you to sort of take away from this is that gender differences in health are incredibly complex,

637
01:29:26,760 --> 01:29:32,250
that we can't make broad generalizations about who's healthier and who is less healthy.

638
01:29:32,550 --> 01:29:37,800
We really have to focus on specific diseases and not this kind of concept of health in general.

639
01:29:39,060 --> 01:29:42,660
And I know that that what we're going to talk about this in just a second.

640
01:29:42,660 --> 01:29:50,940
But like in the beginning of the class, right, if you think back to the theories that we were reading and the things that we were studying,

641
01:29:50,940 --> 01:29:53,309
particularly around socioeconomic status and health,

642
01:29:53,310 --> 01:29:59,820
we could make these kind of sweeping generalizations about how one group is healthier than another group.

643
01:30:00,330 --> 01:30:06,780
But like once we get to sex and gender, that becomes like not so easy to do anymore.

644
01:30:06,810 --> 01:30:12,360
So I want to talk about that in the context of the theories that we started the semester with.

645
01:30:14,100 --> 01:30:17,190
So let's talk about gender and structural inequality.

646
01:30:20,730 --> 01:30:26,970
Well, and maybe before I do that, I'll just ask you, are women in health disparities population?

647
01:30:37,260 --> 01:30:42,770
Yeah. Yeah, sometimes.

648
01:30:43,560 --> 01:30:49,170
Yeah, right. Okay. So this is. It's complicated, so this is not complicated.

649
01:30:49,320 --> 01:30:53,700
So let's start with this one. It's easier. Are women structurally disadvantaged relative to men?

650
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:58,310
Yes. That that one we know.

651
01:30:58,320 --> 01:31:07,470
Right. Women have lower status on average power, privilege, historically have lower education, although, you know, that's not the case anymore.

652
01:31:07,480 --> 01:31:11,910
Right. Like women are earning, at least in the U.S., women earn more bachelor's degrees, more advanced degrees.

653
01:31:11,910 --> 01:31:21,390
Men still have lower income, still less likely to have paid employment and still have the sexual division of labor,

654
01:31:22,050 --> 01:31:29,940
still have more caring responsibilities. All of these things, right, like women as a group in the US are structurally disadvantaged relative to men.

655
01:31:30,270 --> 01:31:40,620
But then the question for us in social epidemiology is, does this structural disadvantage lead to worse health for women?

656
01:31:41,460 --> 01:31:49,410
Right. Like when we were when we were talking about the theory of fundamental causes.

657
01:31:49,410 --> 01:31:54,720
Right. We said social disadvantage produces health disadvantage, remember?

658
01:32:01,050 --> 01:32:05,820
So why doesn't it work exactly the same way for gender?

659
01:32:26,350 --> 01:32:28,509
We've already talked about some of these things, though, Jackie.

660
01:32:28,510 --> 01:32:32,710
You mentioned why men are employed in riskier professions that increase the risk of death.

661
01:32:33,550 --> 01:32:42,470
That's one. Men are less willing.

662
01:32:42,480 --> 01:32:57,080
I'm sorry, but I can you. Yeah.

663
01:32:57,090 --> 01:33:05,460
A lot of these aspects of gender socialization or health promoting or encouraging health, promoting things like social support and asking for help.

664
01:33:05,850 --> 01:33:13,180
Whereas like the way that we socialize. That is what it is, this sort of crazy, risky behavior.

665
01:33:13,610 --> 01:33:17,410
And so that, you know, translates into these kinds of differences.

666
01:33:17,420 --> 01:33:28,340
And so it's like there's there's some ways in which being structurally disadvantaged appears to actually benefit women relative to men,

667
01:33:28,340 --> 01:33:34,940
at least in terms of health, not in terms of economic things or that sort of thing, but in terms of health.

668
01:33:38,640 --> 01:33:43,410
So gender is just a lot more complicated than like socioeconomic status.

669
01:33:44,670 --> 01:33:48,620
The social construction of gender leads to the health behavior and manage that.

670
01:33:48,660 --> 01:33:53,610
The Courtney article talks about leads to advantages and social connectivity,

671
01:33:54,180 --> 01:34:02,760
and there may also be real biological advantages here that aren't the case when we talk about things like socioeconomic status or race.

672
01:34:10,770 --> 01:34:15,910
Okay. So just a few conclusions. Sex and gender are not interchangeable.

673
01:34:18,130 --> 01:34:25,370
So highly related as we've seen. Sex, gender differences and health are complex.

674
01:34:25,640 --> 01:34:31,850
Women are not always disadvantaged relative to men, despite being socially disadvantaged relative to men.

675
01:34:34,930 --> 01:34:40,690
And structural inequality isn't sufficient to explain the differences that we do see.

676
01:34:45,570 --> 01:34:56,040
So I think this is part of why this is a pretty understudied area in social epidemiology because it's a really,

677
01:34:56,040 --> 01:35:02,010
really tricky kind of area to study from an epidemiologic perspective.

678
01:35:10,110 --> 01:35:17,429
All right. Let's take a break. Get more pastries, more fruits, and then come back and get in your groups.

679
01:35:17,430 --> 01:35:22,920
And we're going to talk about the says Peppers. So come back at about 1120.

680
01:35:50,650 --> 01:35:54,070
Oh, yeah. It's great time. You know, I think it'll be.

681
01:35:59,120 --> 01:36:02,820
Oh, yeah, cause I'm just gonna go and do it.

682
01:36:07,330 --> 01:36:10,470
Yes. I presume you're talking about. Yeah.

683
01:36:11,110 --> 01:36:14,660
Oh, sorry. So.

684
01:36:23,100 --> 01:36:26,640
Check this out. Oh, really? Seems to sort of be.

685
01:36:29,680 --> 01:36:34,470
I was. If like yesterday, talking to people.

686
01:36:38,050 --> 01:36:42,530
So she's a sociologist and she's married.

687
01:36:44,650 --> 01:36:50,150
But I think, like, we're interested in studying political determinants.

688
01:36:50,180 --> 01:37:00,790
So that's like doing the project where you're working on a paper that talks about identifies in other cities,

689
01:37:00,790 --> 01:37:09,730
the structural similarity and the very large cities that are like extractive against disinvestment.

690
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:18,750
And they're talking about like how social engineering. Those actions and the health outcomes that she studies.

691
01:37:20,090 --> 01:37:23,990
Okay. So that's really very, very interesting. And I came at it from.

692
01:37:27,980 --> 01:37:31,790
Yeah. I was just thinking about, like, the program now.

693
01:37:31,790 --> 01:37:41,560
I don't know how much longer I. But I tell you my whole life story.

694
01:37:41,570 --> 01:37:49,040
But it's been it's been a lot of interviews and stuff going on at that time anyway.

695
01:37:52,940 --> 01:38:02,560
Yeah. Let's see. We have like. Just to be clear about Twitter, people are trying to.

696
01:38:04,570 --> 01:38:13,720
Sent an analysis of other data mining and Twitter to understand whether or not people were racist to racism.

697
01:38:13,810 --> 01:38:17,830
Well, they're not really. Yeah.

698
01:38:18,970 --> 01:38:21,720
But part of what we've done is we believe that, like.

699
01:38:23,310 --> 01:38:42,690
In the context of race and also in the context of politics, water and weather control, conditions, trends and developments in the world.

700
01:38:43,600 --> 01:38:47,870
Yeah. So, I mean, it's like.

701
01:38:49,240 --> 01:38:52,920
I think it's an interesting thing. Yeah.

702
01:38:53,350 --> 01:38:56,800
Yeah, well, because we try to use computational methods.

703
01:38:57,100 --> 01:39:05,920
I should have said we have a database. The state drops half a billion emails in the four years that happened on that basis.

704
01:39:06,910 --> 01:39:12,160
Originally, originally the project was to try to work there, not OCR in there.

705
01:39:12,700 --> 01:39:16,239
So it took a lot of work to even get them to be able to read the text.

706
01:39:16,240 --> 01:39:21,670
That was many years of work. I don't do that, but you got to figure that out.

707
01:39:22,100 --> 01:39:30,980
Yes. Yes, exactly. Yeah. And even just by like hearing, like it's really hard.

708
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:34,180
I don't know if knew that there wasn't.

709
01:39:36,440 --> 01:39:40,959
Yeah. Yeah, I've noticed.

710
01:39:40,960 --> 01:39:44,170
Public health is a lot faster already. Yeah.

711
01:39:44,440 --> 01:39:47,980
I don't know if you would necessarily name Nicole here, but you do know her.

712
01:39:48,610 --> 01:39:53,570
I request you to call her neighbor. Oh, I definitely. Yeah, she's wonderful.

713
01:39:53,640 --> 01:39:57,940
And I'm so glad she makes things happen. And that hasn't happened, but.

714
01:39:57,940 --> 01:40:03,760
Yeah. Yeah, I just heard. I was wondering how.

715
01:40:04,780 --> 01:40:13,360
And then another one of our. Yeah, that's a female lead on there.

716
01:40:13,490 --> 01:40:20,090
Yeah. Where are you right now for analysis?

717
01:40:20,320 --> 01:40:25,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think you need a minor crisis.

718
01:40:25,660 --> 01:40:35,860
And part of the reason I wanted to do the Twitter analysis is because I was trying to figure out, like, how do I define unexposed and unexposed here?

719
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:41,730
That's right. Like when people don't know about it.

720
01:40:41,740 --> 01:40:44,890
Yeah. Yeah, like something.

721
01:40:45,350 --> 01:40:48,440
Experienced study stress. Yeah. Directly impacted.

722
01:40:50,420 --> 01:40:56,910
We decided to use the emergency declaration because it's been like, oh, yes.

723
01:40:57,040 --> 01:41:03,590
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know.

724
01:41:05,080 --> 01:41:09,320
For example. Right?

725
01:41:09,360 --> 01:41:15,370
Yeah. I like that you guys are also what?

726
01:41:15,370 --> 01:41:25,200
We come in here for player analysis with me.

727
01:41:26,170 --> 01:41:45,490
No, I don't do that. But that's the only time I ever do good work with the people that we were talking about.

728
01:41:49,090 --> 01:41:55,480
Yeah, but, you know I hate racism.

729
01:41:55,630 --> 01:41:59,130
Yeah. Yeah. Right.

730
01:41:59,350 --> 01:42:03,130
For the same way, these e-mails were actually people being racist.

731
01:42:03,280 --> 01:42:19,820
Yeah, but they're not saying. Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

732
01:42:27,620 --> 01:42:33,320
Because the volunteers are serving the people.

733
01:42:36,040 --> 01:42:46,490
People would say, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

734
01:42:47,550 --> 01:42:51,730
That's like yesterday when I was a kid, I was so happy.

735
01:42:52,020 --> 01:43:01,000
Like, I think that they're like, home. After I meeting like that, they were thinking, like, they predicted, but also people were like.

736
01:43:01,330 --> 01:43:19,000
I mean, I knew that it was like, yeah, like, which was the first time I had about yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

737
01:43:19,090 --> 01:43:37,850
It's just like everyone feels like, what do you really think it's gonna be like right before I actually feel like, yeah, yeah.

738
01:43:41,550 --> 01:43:48,460
Think that, right?

739
01:43:50,840 --> 01:43:59,750
Like. How?

740
01:44:03,470 --> 01:44:29,920
Yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

741
01:44:29,950 --> 01:44:33,250
If somebody yesterday was just saying you talking about that. Yeah.

742
01:44:34,810 --> 01:44:48,860
That's right. Yeah. When people. Oh yeah.

743
01:44:54,300 --> 01:45:10,270
Yeah. I think little you have to kind of again.

744
01:45:11,170 --> 01:45:25,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's really difficult because I have to get this, I think because my dad was like.

745
01:45:34,530 --> 01:45:44,620
Sorry to hear about her.

746
01:45:54,740 --> 01:46:01,100
Okay. You're your group. Tents are up here if you want to grab those and find your group.

747
01:46:01,100 --> 01:46:05,180
And then we're talking. The questions for today are about the Montrose paper.

748
01:46:23,470 --> 01:46:32,010
You know. I.

749
01:46:51,960 --> 01:47:04,380
That. Yes.

750
01:47:21,770 --> 01:47:24,990
I think a problem.

751
01:47:25,490 --> 01:47:31,030
Do you have a good strategy?

752
01:47:52,010 --> 01:48:24,170
I think there. I just want to know.

753
01:48:27,760 --> 01:48:35,440
Have. Think.

754
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:14,410
Yeah. Yeah.

755
01:49:16,430 --> 01:49:21,270
I'm just glad I've.

756
01:49:22,960 --> 01:49:29,040
You guys were there. If I could leave at noon today for equipment. Yeah, well, I just like to get out.

757
01:49:29,920 --> 01:49:49,520
How's it going doing? I mean, I think. Here.

758
01:49:53,080 --> 01:49:59,070
Sorry. Yes, I see that.

759
01:50:00,390 --> 01:50:06,120
Okay. Yes. Is.

760
01:50:11,100 --> 01:51:01,640
I. Someone said something like that.

761
01:51:15,070 --> 01:51:26,230
I know this looks like. I.

762
01:51:29,230 --> 01:51:38,420
You know, it's, you know, a three day event.

763
01:52:32,580 --> 01:52:36,600
Great. Well.

764
01:53:15,080 --> 01:53:21,310
I'll put this back up in 1/2, but I'm seeing if I. I tried to put information about.

765
01:53:23,350 --> 01:53:38,580
Something on here for you guys. See if I did it right. I didn't know that.

766
01:53:48,400 --> 01:53:58,770
Oh, yeah. Okay. So Sarah, I just added the life expectancy at birth stuff.

767
01:53:58,770 --> 01:54:03,299
I just copied it from the old canvas page to this one.

768
01:54:03,300 --> 01:54:12,240
So there's a link in here about how it's calculated. And then I also had this paper in here about the cover and how COVID affected it.

769
01:54:13,110 --> 01:55:02,540
Okay. Just a few things.

770
01:55:02,540 --> 01:55:08,070
You. They are very different.

771
01:57:12,390 --> 01:58:00,330
Or. Yeah.

772
01:58:41,880 --> 01:59:59,070
Yeah. Yeah.

773
02:00:59,500 --> 02:01:02,970
Speaking of. You.

774
02:01:14,190 --> 02:01:27,950
I know you think. It is inherently.

775
02:01:38,630 --> 02:01:43,850
I've been here a year.

776
02:01:49,520 --> 02:01:55,630
Yes, I'll be gone, if anything right now.

777
02:01:55,670 --> 02:02:01,040
But that. Yeah.

778
02:02:01,860 --> 02:02:05,530
Yeah. So that's did you did you play a part?

779
02:02:05,980 --> 02:02:14,170
No, no, no, no. Father in law.

780
02:02:16,600 --> 02:02:19,990
How are you feeling about it? We have an expert or not?

781
02:02:20,490 --> 02:02:28,680
No, I heard the personal doctor.

782
02:02:34,900 --> 02:02:37,970
So right about that time of year.

783
02:02:38,320 --> 02:02:42,670
And then you're not to be good.

784
02:02:47,620 --> 02:02:54,390
Yeah. Oh, okay, great.

785
02:02:54,900 --> 02:03:07,190
I think there's no. That's necessary, I think.

786
02:03:07,460 --> 02:03:11,850
You know, there's people that did what they did.

787
02:03:12,200 --> 02:03:16,910
They're the. I'm not here to.

788
02:03:30,030 --> 02:03:33,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

789
02:03:36,250 --> 02:03:44,120
It's not really that often, you know, I, I'm writing over 500 times and I guess it's.

790
02:03:53,220 --> 02:04:00,520
You know. So there. So.

791
02:04:01,710 --> 02:04:07,880
That's why they're arguing as opposed to that something.

792
02:04:12,260 --> 02:04:17,510
Like this, but I mean, yeah, I was just like, it's.

793
02:04:20,780 --> 02:04:27,230
But they so they actually don't exist when they don't have the association.

794
02:04:27,560 --> 02:04:33,330
That's different. I mean, it's a big play.

795
02:04:33,390 --> 02:04:50,620
I mean, the likelihood that you can differentiate that effect on different human factors.

796
02:04:52,450 --> 02:04:58,730
But that these kinds of things are.

797
02:05:01,500 --> 02:05:15,490
There. I mean, I think it would be.

798
02:05:18,860 --> 02:05:29,520
No. Right?

799
02:05:30,200 --> 02:05:33,220
Yeah, that's right. These are kind of like their.

800
02:05:40,720 --> 02:05:48,850
It doesn't happen. Like I said, I mean I mean, it doesn't mean it's a job.

801
02:05:51,360 --> 02:05:55,020
I mean, because they actually. Definitely. Yeah.

802
02:05:58,520 --> 02:06:03,620
Oh, no. Sorry. No, no, no, no, no.

803
02:06:06,920 --> 02:06:17,060
Now I have just about how you feel right now.

804
02:06:17,810 --> 02:06:28,780
Oh, I have to thank you. And I still have to talk to you about what's going on here.

805
02:06:30,010 --> 02:06:36,410
You know what? It doesn't happen to.

806
02:06:43,210 --> 02:06:55,620
I feel like your whole. I know what they're talking about.

807
02:07:01,640 --> 02:07:09,090
Anything else? I think like a lot of families.

808
02:07:13,110 --> 02:07:23,450
And I think. How many of us have tried to think of this?

809
02:07:24,840 --> 02:07:37,620
Things like everybody else, you know?

810
02:07:38,820 --> 02:07:56,550
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

811
02:07:58,910 --> 02:08:27,770
I think that. Like 99.9% of those who.

812
02:08:30,830 --> 02:08:50,290
Previous. It relies on.

813
02:08:53,110 --> 02:08:56,730
This is actually pretty.

814
02:09:05,810 --> 02:09:19,350
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

815
02:09:22,890 --> 02:09:27,230
That's right. Yeah, yeah.

816
02:09:30,300 --> 02:09:45,760
The market is. And.

817
02:09:55,480 --> 02:10:00,570
You know what's going to happen.

818
02:10:06,560 --> 02:10:14,130
1990. Just want your doctor to.

819
02:10:22,540 --> 02:10:32,700
Sorry if you have no idea of the fact that so many people have.

820
02:10:33,430 --> 02:10:38,700
Very sensitive. Yeah.

821
02:10:40,230 --> 02:10:51,100
I was mentioning I was about to go.

822
02:10:59,320 --> 02:11:03,680
But. Carlos.

823
02:11:04,720 --> 02:11:09,090
Yeah. Yeah.

824
02:11:18,270 --> 02:11:25,420
I got. Someone else.

825
02:11:27,090 --> 02:11:32,600
But. Yeah. Generally speaking.

826
02:11:38,870 --> 02:11:48,190
We're certainly. But not actually doing everyone pretty good enough, right?

827
02:11:48,350 --> 02:11:51,430
You're really pretty. Yeah.

828
02:11:52,330 --> 02:11:57,490
You got all.

829
02:12:07,100 --> 02:12:22,260
All right. We've got a couple of things that I think you're going to have to.

830
02:12:30,180 --> 02:12:41,500
But I guess. You know.

831
02:12:46,660 --> 02:12:52,770
Yeah. Really tough weather. I'd like to be.

832
02:13:14,600 --> 02:13:26,330
I. Everything was very.

833
02:13:31,810 --> 02:13:41,270
So this year. I don't.

834
02:13:45,980 --> 02:14:09,080
I would like to thank everyone. Just. I just about that when they were.

835
02:14:16,460 --> 02:14:20,060
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, that's.

836
02:14:22,830 --> 02:14:46,140
So. Okay?

837
02:14:46,250 --> 02:14:52,020
Yeah, we're both. We'll try to get one. Hey.

838
02:14:54,100 --> 02:15:03,040
All right. You guys ready to get started? Okay. They're not talking too much in the back and lost track of time.

839
02:15:03,580 --> 02:15:08,440
All right. Let's start with I'll just let's take volunteers today.

840
02:15:08,920 --> 02:15:12,040
How about what are the author's research questions?

841
02:15:13,210 --> 02:15:16,830
Yes. Friends. Uh huh.

842
02:15:27,940 --> 02:15:32,500
Are you sure? Everything's.

843
02:15:34,850 --> 02:15:37,980
Characteristics like have. How?

844
02:15:42,130 --> 02:15:49,390
Most of the variation in the new conceptual features similarly contributes to the variation of.

845
02:15:50,500 --> 02:15:56,920
Mm. Yeah. So what I have and I think these are the same as you, but tell me if I'm missing something.

846
02:15:57,100 --> 02:16:00,639
What explains inequality and women's mortality across this?

847
02:16:00,640 --> 02:16:07,990
Kind of like their overarching question is why are there differences across states in women's mortality?

848
02:16:08,740 --> 02:16:13,800
And then do these inequalities reflect differences between states in their residents?

849
02:16:14,050 --> 02:16:19,120
Is it about who lives there and the individual characteristics of those people living in that state?

850
02:16:19,570 --> 02:16:23,950
Is it about the context of the state or is it about both?

851
02:16:24,310 --> 02:16:30,420
And then does the context of the state matter more for women than for men?

852
02:16:30,430 --> 02:16:37,710
So there's this piece of trying to understand differential impact of the state context on the health of women and men.

853
02:16:40,930 --> 02:16:44,350
Who wants to share their conceptual model? Anybody?

854
02:16:46,480 --> 02:17:19,110
Okay. Thank you. Yeah.

855
02:17:23,730 --> 02:17:33,900
I never spell anything right on the boards that know you start writing, you're like, Oh, because we all type so much now we don't write.

856
02:17:33,900 --> 02:17:43,040
And so I don't remember how to spell anything. Okay.

857
02:17:44,120 --> 02:17:47,460
All right. What else? Here. You want to talk us through it? Yeah, sure.

858
02:17:47,490 --> 02:17:55,670
Okay, so it's like the primary research question of this study is like studying the mortality difference between different states.

859
02:17:56,000 --> 02:18:07,620
So I got this. Mortality and then women's personal characteristics and also the status of sexual contact, strong and characteristic.

860
02:18:08,090 --> 02:18:17,110
The fact that this kind of a differences between the differences in mortality, different differences and also in the mean time,

861
02:18:17,290 --> 02:18:26,260
close personal characteristics and contact characteristics that kids are interacting with.

862
02:18:26,690 --> 02:18:30,020
Yeah, I got an arrow over here.

863
02:18:30,040 --> 02:18:33,070
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

864
02:18:36,170 --> 02:18:41,960
So I drew it slightly differently. I'll show you mine too, so that you can compare and see what you think.

865
02:18:42,230 --> 02:18:47,750
But again, as I was saying to all the groups like this is really just about helping you think through the question.

866
02:18:47,750 --> 02:18:51,280
It's not about it being like right or wrong.

867
02:18:51,290 --> 02:18:57,910
So I was thinking about like individual socio.

868
02:18:58,850 --> 02:19:05,420
Here we go. No resources.

869
02:19:07,790 --> 02:19:12,050
As being a predictor of mortality.

870
02:19:14,680 --> 02:19:19,330
And then also state in context.

871
02:19:22,050 --> 02:19:27,660
Being a predictor of mortality that these two things interact.

872
02:19:27,660 --> 02:19:37,350
So that's like how you guys do it over there. And then that the relationship between between state context and mortality depends on

873
02:19:37,350 --> 02:19:42,480
gender with their argument that it's more influential for mortality of women versus men.

874
02:19:43,440 --> 02:19:49,530
So that's I mean, you know, roughly kind of the same thing, just thinking through like that.

875
02:19:49,530 --> 02:19:57,540
There's this interaction kind of thing happening here that these are kind of part of the state.

876
02:19:57,990 --> 02:20:06,180
Um, and then, I mean, this is individual and then this is state and then that is influencing mortality.

877
02:20:08,490 --> 02:20:18,120
Okay. Uh, let's see what individual and contextual characteristics of the authors include in their models.

878
02:20:23,470 --> 02:20:28,960
Why don't I just read that one? Because it's super long and you can see if you got the same thing.

879
02:20:29,200 --> 02:20:34,930
So my impression was that they were using age and race ethnicity as confounders,

880
02:20:35,170 --> 02:20:40,749
that they were like they were treating that as confounders and that then there's

881
02:20:40,750 --> 02:20:47,620
socioeconomic resources which is here are individual things like the individual's education,

882
02:20:48,100 --> 02:20:52,810
their employment status, their family poverty income ratio and their marital status.

883
02:20:53,260 --> 02:21:00,520
And then the contextual variables were 21 state level variables in five latent factors.

884
02:21:02,020 --> 02:21:09,750
So they had an economic environment latent factor that included gross state product per capita education expenditures,

885
02:21:09,760 --> 02:21:15,879
per capita percent of the state's revenue from sales tax, median household income percent,

886
02:21:15,880 --> 02:21:20,560
female headed household below poverty, percent of adults, 25 plus with college.

887
02:21:21,310 --> 02:21:28,270
So that was an economic environment in the state. Then they had a social cohesion kind of measure which included the Gini coefficient,

888
02:21:28,270 --> 02:21:33,579
which is a measure of income inequality, the unemployment rate, violent crime rate and the state level.

889
02:21:33,580 --> 02:21:38,140
Putnam Social Capital Index, which has a million variables in it.

890
02:21:39,350 --> 02:21:43,900
And then they also had a latent factor that was socio political orientation.

891
02:21:44,110 --> 02:21:49,569
So that's the percent earned income tax credit offered by the state per capita welfare expenditures,

892
02:21:49,570 --> 02:21:56,050
percent presidential elections that matched the Republican candidate overall score of the Medicaid program.

893
02:21:56,290 --> 02:21:58,750
Then they have one that's physical infrastructure.

894
02:21:59,050 --> 02:22:06,190
So that's the percent in the metropolitan percent living in metropolitan areas, percent using public transportation and housing affordability.

895
02:22:06,490 --> 02:22:08,830
And then the last one was the tobacco environment.

896
02:22:08,840 --> 02:22:18,610
So the number of cigaret sales per capita percent retail price, a pack of cigarets comprised of state taxes,

897
02:22:18,970 --> 02:22:23,080
percent contribution of tobacco manufacturing to gross state product.

898
02:22:25,250 --> 02:22:30,840
Oh, that's a lot. And I actually don't know. Could you tell from the paper where they got those measures?

899
02:22:30,850 --> 02:22:35,650
Because like I read it again, it was like, where did this come from?

900
02:22:36,340 --> 02:22:40,600
I don't think they tell you they're definitely not in the National Longitudinal Mortality Study.

901
02:22:40,900 --> 02:22:43,960
These had to come from like a separate source.

902
02:22:44,380 --> 02:22:50,620
Um, but I don't, I don't know where they got it from, but yeah.

903
02:22:50,620 --> 02:22:56,380
So, so any questions about what they did there with all those measures and the lead factors.

904
02:22:59,060 --> 02:23:06,380
It just becomes like each one of those things that I just said becomes like a, like a coefficient in the model.

905
02:23:07,040 --> 02:23:13,519
So there would be like a score for each of those five latent factors.

906
02:23:13,520 --> 02:23:21,140
And then there would also be like a variable for education, employment status, family period, marital status, and also age and race.

907
02:23:23,510 --> 02:23:29,030
Sometimes it's hard to see that in these kinds of papers when it's like our really complicated way of measuring.

908
02:23:30,380 --> 02:23:35,120
All right. Who would like to explain the findings presented in Figure two?

909
02:23:45,930 --> 02:23:53,500
Olivia. So it's looking at the differences in deaths and mortality in the.

910
02:23:54,200 --> 02:23:57,410
Based in comparison to the average state mortality. Yeah.

911
02:23:57,620 --> 02:24:06,230
So that line for is meant to represent that average something from all the states over that and the lines are 95% coverage and they

912
02:24:06,650 --> 02:24:13,879
are showing the states with this curvilinear pattern of these states that have much lower mortality rates compared to the average.

913
02:24:13,880 --> 02:24:16,310
And then it kind of curves up and then it jumps up to those higher.

914
02:24:16,310 --> 02:24:23,780
So and I thought it was interesting, they noted that in those states they have lower than the average,

915
02:24:23,780 --> 02:24:27,469
that it's big jumps and then it kind of narrows together and then it might start again.

916
02:24:27,470 --> 02:24:35,030
So then as you jump around to the different panels that can be adjusted for age and race and you can kind of see the color coded,

917
02:24:35,030 --> 02:24:38,900
the longer the higher ones, red and blue. And you can see that they start moving around a little bit.

918
02:24:39,260 --> 02:24:46,790
And then as you control for individual other factors, you'll see it starts to lose its shape and things are starting to drift towards that center.

919
02:24:46,790 --> 02:24:52,400
And then once you adjust for individual characteristics, everything kind of comes together around the center.

920
02:24:52,730 --> 02:24:56,510
Yes. Kind of shows that they're accounting for that difference. Yeah, they're explaining the differences.

921
02:24:56,510 --> 02:25:04,700
So that first panel is showing you that there just are like these really big differences in women's mortality across like the US states.

922
02:25:05,660 --> 02:25:12,830
And then once you adjust for differences in age and raise, because remember when we talked about race,

923
02:25:12,830 --> 02:25:22,700
we showed the geographic patterning of race in the US that like people aren't distributed evenly across the U.S. by age or race.

924
02:25:22,700 --> 02:25:25,850
And we know that these are like important contributors to mortality.

925
02:25:26,060 --> 02:25:32,210
So once you account for the differences and kind of like the age structure of the states and the racial composition,

926
02:25:32,510 --> 02:25:37,640
you see that some of those like those differences in women's mortality go away.

927
02:25:38,120 --> 02:25:45,140
Then they adjust for these individual level characteristics like people's own income and education and things like that.

928
02:25:45,440 --> 02:25:48,559
And that that takes away some of the difference.

929
02:25:48,560 --> 02:25:54,950
Right. Because we know that there's higher average levels of education for people in some state versus some states versus others.

930
02:25:55,190 --> 02:25:57,410
That helps explain some of those differences.

931
02:25:58,130 --> 02:26:05,570
And then once you account for these state level characteristics, that's where the greatest attenuation is happening.

932
02:26:05,810 --> 02:26:07,160
And by the time you do that,

933
02:26:07,160 --> 02:26:15,110
basically we don't observe differences across states because it's being explained by all these characteristics that have been adjusted.

934
02:26:17,790 --> 02:26:25,890
So. Question five How did the results for men differ from the main study results and what is the author's explanation for the difference?

935
02:26:43,290 --> 02:26:46,520
You guys are too tired. All right.

936
02:26:46,990 --> 02:26:55,750
State level mortality variation was less strongly associated with the contextual factors among men, which is what they hypothesized here.

937
02:26:56,170 --> 02:27:02,350
Individual factors explained 34% of the variation in mortality among men versus 30% for women.

938
02:27:02,350 --> 02:27:08,020
So similar for women and men in terms of how much the individual factors explain mortality.

939
02:27:08,770 --> 02:27:14,080
But contextual factors explain 41% for men, but 62% for women.

940
02:27:14,830 --> 02:27:22,460
And so they argue that economic environments and social cohesion are most important for women, but the tobacco environment was most important for men.

941
02:27:22,480 --> 02:27:27,910
Remember how we were talking about those gender differences in mortality over time and the importance of smoking to that?

942
02:27:27,910 --> 02:27:31,360
So this actually makes a lot of sense. Many state parts.

943
02:27:31,370 --> 02:27:37,420
So their argument for this, why it matters more for women is because many state policies are more relevant for women,

944
02:27:37,780 --> 02:27:43,010
because they are economically disadvantaged relative to men and have greater caregiving responsibilities.

945
02:27:43,030 --> 02:27:48,880
So a lot of these factors have to do with things like education and welfare programs and that kind of thing.

946
02:27:50,980 --> 02:27:56,200
What did the authors mean when they say individuals and contexts can shape each other?

947
02:27:56,440 --> 02:28:00,410
Which is this or this? Yeah.

948
02:28:02,080 --> 02:28:07,310
What are the implications of this for their policy recommendations on page 570?

949
02:28:11,410 --> 02:28:20,880
Yeah. Yeah.

950
02:28:25,010 --> 02:28:31,280
That. Yeah.

951
02:28:32,240 --> 02:28:41,990
Yeah. This is challenging, right? Because my own, my ability to, like, complete a certain level of education depends on my city context.

952
02:28:41,990 --> 02:28:46,729
Right? And then like if I'm more educated, it feeds back into these aspects of state context.

953
02:28:46,730 --> 02:28:51,200
So they're not they're not really like completely distinct from one another.

954
02:28:51,500 --> 02:28:58,370
So, you know, something like social cohesion, for example, depends in part on the characteristics of the people in the group.

955
02:28:58,910 --> 02:29:08,000
Um, so it's hard to increase social cohesion without addressing factors that contribute to it, like education or income inequality.

956
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:15,260
So these two things are really linked, and when we focus on only one level, it's not likely to be effective.

957
02:29:15,500 --> 02:29:21,400
And so I think sometimes we want to look at these kinds of things and be like, here's this point where we could intervene, right?

958
02:29:21,410 --> 02:29:28,490
If we just changed the earned income tax credit, then we could have this big impact on on mortality.

959
02:29:28,730 --> 02:29:36,860
But the truth is, the earned income tax credit is part of like a larger a larger sort of, I don't know,

960
02:29:36,860 --> 02:29:43,009
universe of things that are influential for health and that really are connected to each other in important ways.

961
02:29:43,010 --> 02:29:51,620
So this is in this when I was talking to the group in the back about the field of work and being able to measure social context and things like that,

962
02:29:51,620 --> 02:30:03,020
I think we have to keep in mind that if our goal is that we want to identify like one policy lever that we can change to improve things,

963
02:30:03,470 --> 02:30:08,870
that's probably going to be unlikely because it's part of a constellation of factors.

964
02:30:09,430 --> 02:30:14,600
And so we have to think about that in our measurement, but also in the implications of the findings for that.

965
02:30:14,900 --> 02:30:20,690
And um, and then think is that, um.

966
02:30:23,150 --> 02:30:29,630
From a public health perspective, is that making progress?

967
02:30:30,700 --> 02:30:36,190
Does it fit with what we're trying to do from a public health kind of perspective?

968
02:30:40,960 --> 02:30:46,730
I guess the question is. Can you intervene on this?

969
02:30:48,470 --> 02:30:56,810
If we like, let's say we identify that this the state context is causally related to mortality and we want to intervene on it.

970
02:30:56,810 --> 02:31:11,850
What would you intervene on based on this study? Like, Do you feel like this study tells you something that you can intervene on?

971
02:31:22,810 --> 02:31:26,960
Yeah. Not specifically that kind of part of the economic environment.

972
02:31:30,150 --> 02:31:36,990
Yeah. So it's like not super specific. Maybe it seems to be pointing in the direction of the economic environment,

973
02:31:36,990 --> 02:31:43,350
but it's hard to know how the economic environment is shaped by the other things that are like being measured in here.

974
02:31:43,350 --> 02:31:46,200
And if you only changed something about the like,

975
02:31:47,160 --> 02:31:51,810
would you only change something about the economic environment without changing the other aspects of it?

976
02:31:52,470 --> 02:31:55,410
And if you could, would it have an impact on health?

977
02:31:55,410 --> 02:32:05,280
So I think that's that's the thing that's kind of tricky about trying to measure something as complicated as like the state context.

978
02:32:05,580 --> 02:32:12,360
But of course, you want to capture all of it because that's what it is that you think matters.

979
02:32:12,360 --> 02:32:17,520
So the solution isn't to just like measure 200 individual things.

980
02:32:18,610 --> 02:32:23,770
So it's a challenge. All right.

981
02:32:23,780 --> 02:32:30,849
Have a good weekend, everybody. If you want a bagel, take it.

982
02:32:30,850 --> 02:32:32,050
It's going back upstairs.
