00:00:00,215 --> 00:00:11,215
Welcome to Part One of the session on Confounding, in which we will formally define the concept of confounding in epidemiological research.

2
00:00:11,215 --> 00:00:19,215
So I think it's useful to approach the concept of confounding when thinking through randomization,

3
00:00:19,215 --> 00:00:26,215
why we randomize, and how we think about this with respect to achieving exchange ability.

4
00:00:26,215 --> 00:00:35,215
And so I hope that this session is going to be relatively intuitive because it builds on what we've learned in the early session on causality,

5
00:00:35,215 --> 00:00:41,215
where we introduced the potential outcomes framework and counterfactuals,

6
00:00:41,215 --> 00:00:47,215
as well as what we learned in the session on intervention trials with respect to randomization.

7
00:00:47,215 --> 00:00:53,215
I've also alluded many times throughout this course so far to the definition of confounding.

8
00:00:53,215 --> 00:00:55,215
So if anything has been unclear to date,

9
00:00:55,215 --> 00:01:03,215
hopefully after this session you will have a much firmer and clearer foundation about the concept of confounding.

10
00:01:03,215 --> 00:01:06,215
So please recall that in a randomized controlled trial,

11
00:01:06,215 --> 00:01:13,215
we randomized the receipt of a treatment to ensure that the treated and untreated groups are exchangeable

12
00:01:13,215 --> 00:01:18,215
with respect to any factors that could also influence the outcome under study.

13
00:01:18,215 --> 00:01:26,215
And so these factors could be things like age, comorbidities or other treatments that people may be receiving.

14
00:01:26,215 --> 00:01:31,215
So if we think about randomization as a coin toss, then, for example,

15
00:01:31,215 --> 00:01:38,215
we conduct our randomization and then the individuals who are enrolled in our RCT will either receive,

16
00:01:38,215 --> 00:01:42,215
let's say, a vaccine or a placebo. Under the vaccine,

17
00:01:42,215 --> 00:01:47,215
we set X, which is the variable representing the treatment, equal to one.

18
00:01:47,215 --> 00:01:52,215
And under placebo, we will set X equal to zero.

19
00:01:52,215 --> 00:01:59,215
And recall that when we learned about potential outcomes, the idea here is that before randomization happens,

20
00:01:59,215 --> 00:02:10,215
so before this coin is tossed and before we know what each individual person in the RCC is going to receive, each person has two potential outcomes.

21
00:02:10,215 --> 00:02:14,215
One that will be observed under the vaccine, where X equals one,

22
00:02:14,215 --> 00:02:19,215
and one that will be observed under the placebo, where X equals zero,

23
00:02:19,215 --> 00:02:28,215
after the coin is tossed. So after randomization occurs and treatment is allocated, then one of these potential outcomes becomes the truth.

24
00:02:28,215 --> 00:02:36,215
It is the factual or observed outcome that the person experiences under the treatment that they are assigned to,

25
00:02:36,215 --> 00:02:42,215
whether that is the vaccine or the placebo. and the other potential outcome remains counterfactual.

26
00:02:42,215 --> 00:02:47,215
That is, it is counter to fact and it is unobserved. It did not happen.

27
00:02:47,215 --> 00:02:56,215
It is hypothetical. And importantly, each person's potential outcomes are independent of the treatment they actually receive

28
00:02:56,215 --> 00:03:01,215
once the coin is tossed. And this is exchangeability.

29
00:03:01,215 --> 00:03:05,215
And I'll just note here as a reminder, formally,

30
00:03:05,215 --> 00:03:14,215
we denote exchangeability using this notation where Ya indicates the potential outcomes under the treatment a,

31
00:03:14,215 --> 00:03:24,215
being independent of the actual treatment received, which is indicated by the capital A.

32
00:03:24,215 --> 00:03:29,215
Now, let's move to thinking about the observational world in observational studies.

33
00:03:29,215 --> 00:03:36,215
And we learned about these recently. These are namely cohort studies, case control studies and cross-sectional studies.

34
00:03:36,215 --> 00:03:39,215
We obviously cannot randomize exposures.

35
00:03:39,215 --> 00:03:49,215
Instead, we use unexposed comparison groups in observational epidemiology in order to estimate the effects of exposures on outcomes.

36
00:03:49,215 --> 00:03:52,215
And so in these observational study designs,

37
00:03:52,215 --> 00:04:01,215
we try to make sure that the observed outcomes for the unexposed group represent the counterfactual potential outcomes for the exposed group,

38
00:04:01,215 --> 00:04:06,215
had they not been exposed. This is key here.

39
00:04:06,215 --> 00:04:15,215
And in other words, what this means is that we want the exposed and unexposed groups to be as similar to each other as possible,

40
00:04:15,215 --> 00:04:22,215
with the exception of their exposure status. So let's work through this with an example.

41
00:04:22,215 --> 00:04:26,215
Let's say that we have a research question, which is about the effects of heavy coffee consumption,

42
00:04:26,215 --> 00:04:34,215
which I've defined here as six or more cups a day compared to one cup a day on the risk of myocardial infarction.

43
00:04:34,215 --> 00:04:37,215
And I've denoted a question mark over the arrow here.

44
00:04:37,215 --> 00:04:43,215
And you can see, clearly I'm building a DAG indicating that we don't know the nature of this relationship.

45
00:04:43,215 --> 00:04:48,215
That's why it's our research question. And let's say that we use data from a cohort study.

46
00:04:48,215 --> 00:04:58,215
So we enroll people into our cohort study and then we divide them into exposed and unexposed groups on the basis of their coffee consumption.

47
00:04:58,215 --> 00:05:05,215
But let's take a sidestep here and let's imagine that coffee consumption was randomized, so in the randomized world, ideally,

48
00:05:05,215 --> 00:05:13,215
we would want the potential outcomes for the heavy versus light coffee drinkers to be equal before they receive their coffee drinking exposure.

49
00:05:13,215 --> 00:05:20,215
So you could think about this hypothetically as being a randomized treatment where we flip a coin and then we assign half

50
00:05:20,215 --> 00:05:25,215
of our study population to drink six or more cups a day and then half of our city population to drink one cup per day.

51
00:05:25,215 --> 00:05:29,215
And then you can readily imagine that with a large enough sample size,

52
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:37,215
the distribution of all other characteristics of the heavy coffee drinkers in the late coffee drinkers will be approximately equal in the two groups.

53
00:05:37,215 --> 00:05:45,215
But in the observational world, we know it's messier than that. We can't assign people to drink six cups a day of coffee or more.

54
00:05:45,215 --> 00:05:51,215
And so you can imagine that there might be a lot of differences between people who are really heavy coffee drinkers versus not.

55
00:05:51,215 --> 00:05:58,215
And one at one key example here, and this is a real example that's been observed in epidemiological research before,

56
00:05:58,215 --> 00:06:03,215
is that cigarette smoking is often related to very heavy coffee consumption,

57
00:06:03,215 --> 00:06:09,215
and it is also related to the risk of myocardial infarction, which is our outcome of interest.

58
00:06:09,215 --> 00:06:19,215
And so I've indicated that here on this DAG, with arrows going from cigarette smoking to both of coffee consumption and myocardial infarction,

59
00:06:19,215 --> 00:06:24,215
this DAG here is the classic DAG that depicts confounding.

60
00:06:24,215 --> 00:06:29,215
So if our research question is indicated by this red line with the arrow above it,

61
00:06:29,215 --> 00:06:40,215
what we have here is actually a backdoor path that is induced between coffee consumption and myocardial infarction through cigaret smoking.

62
00:06:40,215 --> 00:06:48,215
In this example, if we had estimated a relative risk for the association between heavy coffee consumption and myocardial infarction,

63
00:06:48,215 --> 00:06:56,215
but we did not account for the confounding effects of cigarette smoking on this relationship, then the observed relative risk would not be causal.

64
00:06:56,215 --> 00:07:04,215
It would not equal a causal relative risk. And so confounding can be present in any type of measure of association.

65
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:08,215
So not just the relative risk, but also in odds ratios and risk differences.

66
00:07:08,215 --> 00:07:15,215
So absolute measures of association as well. And let's work through two formal definitions.

67
00:07:15,215 --> 00:07:24,215
There are many different ways of expressing this verbally, sometimes different definitions click differently or are more intuitive or less intuitive.

68
00:07:24,215 --> 00:07:30,215
So a definition from the Szklo textbook is confounding is a non causal association between a given exposure

69
00:07:30,215 --> 00:07:37,215
and an outcome which is observed as a result of the influence of a third variable or group of variables.

70
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:44,215
The second definition is how I would put it into words. I'm putting this here in case it is more intuitive or easier to understand.

71
00:07:44,215 --> 00:07:53,215
So I would explain confounding as a spurious meaning, non causal or distorted observed association between an exposure and outcome.

72
00:07:53,215 --> 00:07:58,215
That is a result of an unmeasured common cause of both the exposure and outcome.

73
00:07:58,215 --> 00:08:07,215
And when I say spurious, I mean an association, either positive or negative, is induced when there should be no association at all.

74
00:08:07,215 --> 00:08:14,215
And I say distorted, meaning there might be some association, whether positive or negative of some magnitude,

75
00:08:14,215 --> 00:08:22,215
but it has been distorted such that the magnitude or direction of that true association is changed.

76
00:08:22,215 --> 00:08:30,215
And when I say third variable here, a third variable in confounding language means a common cause of exposure and outcome.

77
00:08:30,215 --> 00:08:37,215
So this table here, I think you have some useful terminology and examples in working through the

78
00:08:37,215 --> 00:08:44,215
ideas of confounding as they happen in RCTs and in observational studies.

79
00:08:44,215 --> 00:08:48,215
And one thing that I would like to show here, as a takeaway point from this table, is that

80
00:08:48,215 --> 00:08:54,215
confounding is most likely to occur in observational studies as opposed to experimental studies.

81
00:08:54,215 --> 00:08:58,215
And of course, this is because we cannot randomize an observational research.

82
00:08:58,215 --> 00:09:03,215
But I would like to note that confounding actually can occur in RCTs.

83
00:09:03,215 --> 00:09:08,215
And so this is most likely to happen in a small RCT,

84
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:16,215
where any source of confounding would be due to any random difference that emerges between the treated and untreated groups,

85
00:09:16,215 --> 00:09:21,215
potentially through a failure of randomization. But most likely due to random error.

86
00:09:21,215 --> 00:09:29,215
And of course, as we learned in the previous session on systematic and random error, this is most likely to happen with a small sample size.

87
00:09:29,215 --> 00:09:34,215
When this happens in an RCT, we call it chance confounding or chance non-exchangeability.

88
00:09:34,215 --> 00:09:44,215
In contrast, when confounding happens in observational research, we refer to it as structural confounding or structural non-exchange ability.

89
00:09:44,215 --> 00:09:49,215
Let's go through a couple very quick examples. It's easy to see confounding when we

90
00:09:49,215 --> 00:09:54,215
compare crude mortality rates across countries with very different age distributions.

91
00:09:54,215 --> 00:09:59,215
And we can see here in this example, the crude mortality rates, and crude here means unadjusted,

92
00:09:59,215 --> 00:10:09,215
They range from three point eight per 1000 population members in Costa Rica, up to eight point seven per 1000 population members in the United States.

93
00:10:09,215 --> 00:10:15,215
But we know that these countries have very different age distributions. So we should actually use some method of confounder control.

94
00:10:15,215 --> 00:10:21,215
And we will talk in the live session about how to account for these differences in age structures across countries.

95
00:10:21,215 --> 00:10:28,215
And when we do that, you can see that the age adjusted mortality rates are very different from the crude mortality rates.

96
00:10:28,215 --> 00:10:36,215
Here's another example. And this is an example that is most commonly encountered in clinical epidemiology, and that is confounding by severity.

97
00:10:36,215 --> 00:10:44,215
So it's been reported that certain medical or tertiary prevention interventions for COPD are associated with unfavorable health outcomes.

98
00:10:44,215 --> 00:10:49,215
So things like long term oxygen therapy or undergoing respiratory rehab.

99
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:56,215
However, individuals with more severe cases of COPD are more likely to receive these interventions.

100
00:10:56,215 --> 00:11:04,215
it is important to evaluate confounding by severity when we're interested in whether certain treatments might have adverse long term health outcomes.

101
00:11:04,215 --> 00:11:10,215
This is also referred to as confounding by indication. That's the end of Part One.

102
00:11:10,215 --> 00:11:12,652
The next is Part Two, identifying confounding.
