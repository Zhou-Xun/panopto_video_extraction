00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:07,200
Hello everyone. Welcome to the course of Applied Mediation Analysis

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:11,040
at the University of Michigan Summer Session in Epidemiology.

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:17,850
I'm Linda Valeri, assistant professor of biostatistics at Columbia Mailman School of Public Health,

4
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:23,460
and I'm very much looking forward to meeting you all at the end of July.

5
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:28,350
Here is a short recording to briefly introduce to you the course.

6
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:35,800
As described in the syllabus that you can find on Canvas,

7
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:45,040
the main prerequisites for the course in causal mediation is that you are familiar with linear and logistic regression because

8
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:57,189
mediation analysis is a very rich area of research in causal inference and it's really developing very fast. And as I speak now,

9
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:03,100
several papers are coming out to describe new methods to study mediating mechanisms.

10
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,380
In this course,

11
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:15,879
we will make sure to lay down a solid foundation of the basics of the concepts of causal mediation analysis and also towards the end of the course,

12
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:27,130
discuss some of the most recent advances and cutting edge statistical software to conduct mediation analysis. Throughout the course,

13
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:34,690
I really would like to encourage you to ask me a lot of questions, either related to the lecture notes,

14
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:41,260
but even beyond related to the research you are working on right now, potentially related to mediation analysis.

15
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:49,660
I hope that the slides that I provide you during the course can be a useful reference for you in the future.

16
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:57,610
And they have definitely considerable text, but if you would like to have more information about mediation analysis,

17
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:05,410
I highly recommend purchasing the book by Tyler VanderWeele, Explanation Causal Inference Methods for Mediation and Interaction.

18
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:10,090
This year, the course will take a hybrid format.

19
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:14,700
As I suggested that we are all we will be consumed out of been always.

20
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:19,000
I kept to live lectures and a lot of meetings.

21
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:25,030
So the course we proceed in this way. I will record the action.

22
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:33,670
I've already recorded all the lectures for the course and the UK you sent to them at your own pace.

23
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,340
But of course, following this schedule of the course. That I will describe shortly.

24
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:50,560
We will then. Every day of the week of the course, in one hour of live love session where we will have time for discussion,

25
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:55,000
as well as going through together some practical exercises.

26
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,850
Working Group. So in the course it's very important that you use the best speech and in

27
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:07,930
particular the discussion board the to ask the questions as I described shortly.

28
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:13,559
The course, we covered the following topics. First,

29
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:22,889
I will introduce traditional methods of not and cease and then introduce new concepts under the counterfactual

30
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:31,150
framework for causal inference and discuss under which assumptions identify weak assumptions in particular.

31
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:36,930
We can hope to recover inferences on direct and indirect effects.

32
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:43,100
I will then discuss parametric regression approaches to conduct the mediation,

33
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:52,370
analysis and associated software that really helps using these approaches in a very easy to use way.

34
00:03:53,430 --> 00:04:00,000
I will then discuss how we can unify concepts of mediation and interaction.

35
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:11,140
As as we will see our two potentially cool chlorine mechanisms that can explain exposure effects.

36
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:20,420
As we will see, magician analysis will depend on several assumptions that are often untestable.

37
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:27,390
That's why we spend a lot of time discussing sensitivity analyzes for a measure of confounding in particular.

38
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:33,270
And then we concluded the course with the more advanced the topic that is,

39
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:39,510
how can we conduct mediation analysis when we have more than one mediator of interest?

40
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:48,120
So what are the potential strategies that we can use? What are the type of questions we can ask when more than one mediator is of interest?

41
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,760
So a few housekeeping details about the course.

42
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:58,800
On the first days of class,

43
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:06,650
I would like to ask you to introduce yourself on the discussion board briefly mentioning why you are interested in attending this course.

44
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:11,990
Tell me or tell us anything about you that you'd like to share.

45
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:24,260
Then every day prior to our live like sessions, which will occur at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time,

46
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:31,860
I will ask you to listen to the recordings of the lecture of the associated with that day.

47
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:43,120
Okay. After listening to the recording, I will ask you also please post a question or comment about the lecture you just listened to.

48
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:56,240
We will then meet and have our legal sessions where we start with discussion and questions that you posted on the discussion boards.

49
00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:00,469
And then in the second part of the we will walk by.

50
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:08,760
We walk you through some practical exercises and the use of statistical software for mediation either in states or.

51
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:15,460
I will also provide clothing sets on canvas for those of you who prefer to use.

52
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:26,290
I also prepared some videos for those of you who would like to read you main concepts in puzzling incidents.

53
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:33,310
In particular, I review potential outcomes directed at secret graphs and marginal structural models.

54
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:44,620
I will also be available for office hours right after our live like sessions for one hour from day two today for.

55
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:55,970
Another important aspect of the course is that on day four, we will review an assignment that I will hand out on Monday,

56
00:06:56,270 --> 00:07:01,100
and you will have time until the end of the day Wednesday, to work on that.

57
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:06,800
And on Thursday, we spend our life labor discussing the assignment together.

58
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:18,080
As I said before, all this information can be found on canvas in the syllabus, and please contact me in case you have additional questions.

59
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:25,560
I look forward to meeting you all. Thank you for joining our course.

60
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:27,430
Thanks.
