This video is on developing a research project.

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:07,540
Developing a research project involves several steps.

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:11,245
First you want to think through your research question exactly what

4
00:00:11,245 --> 00:00:13,911
interventions are you going to be considering?

5
00:00:13,911 --> 00:00:15,640
What's the setting?

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:20,771
And what perspective are you gonna be taking?

7
00:00:20,771 --> 00:00:24,497
Next you wanna sketch out the analysis, when I say sketch out,

8
00:00:24,497 --> 00:00:28,521
I mean decide exactly again what interventions are gonna be doing.

9
00:00:28,521 --> 00:00:31,227
But how do those interventions affect costs and

10
00:00:31,227 --> 00:00:35,740
how do those interventions affect health outcomes that you care about?

11
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:40,776
And how do those health outcomes and costs, what happens to them

12
00:00:40,776 --> 00:00:47,540
over the long term are their direct and indirect costs and health outcomes?

13
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:50,640
The third step is to collect data for your model.

14
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,306
So going to the generally this is going to the economic literature and

15
00:00:55,306 --> 00:00:59,910
finding articles on effectiveness of interventions and so forth.

16
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:04,611
It could also be collecting cost data from databases.

17
00:01:04,611 --> 00:01:08,207
You could collect primary data on effectiveness for example.

18
00:01:08,207 --> 00:01:10,338
Then step four is adjust the data,

19
00:01:10,338 --> 00:01:14,381
adjusting the data means maybe doing some inflation adjusting.

20
00:01:14,381 --> 00:01:17,087
So if you have some cost data from several years ago bring it to

21
00:01:17,087 --> 00:01:19,040
current your dollars.

22
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:25,260
If you have charged data you wanna convert that to costs and you build your model.

23
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:29,814
So this is creating a mathematical representation of how people

24
00:01:29,814 --> 00:01:32,346
progress through their disease and

25
00:01:32,346 --> 00:01:37,640
how the diseases are connected to costs and health outcomes.

26
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,101
And you run and test the model.

27
00:01:39,101 --> 00:01:44,095
Make sure your model is doing something reasonable, conduct sensitivity analysis

28
00:01:44,095 --> 00:01:49,340
so see how your results might change if some of your assumptions are changing.

29
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:54,696
Finally we write up the analysis and I would add a last step that Peter Munich

30
00:01:54,696 --> 00:01:59,471
does not have in his book and that is iterate on your model and data.

31
00:01:59,471 --> 00:02:03,088
So as you've done your sensitivity analysis you might decide

32
00:02:03,088 --> 00:02:07,640
we forgot something in our model or we need to collect some additional data.

33
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,640
So this might be an iterative process.

34
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:12,640
You might go through this in several cycles.

35
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,880
In Peter Munich's book, how is a diagram for how he sketches out the analysis.

36
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:22,770
I actually don't like this kind of almost bored chart tree structure.

37
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:24,810
I think there's a better way to do this.

38
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:30,140
I like decision trees and many of may have been exposed to these in the past.

39
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:33,446
The decision tree involves squares which

40
00:02:33,446 --> 00:02:37,891
represent a rectangles which represent the decision.

41
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:40,090
So here we may have some policy decision.

42
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:43,971
The arms emanating from that square are they different alternatives.

43
00:02:43,971 --> 00:02:48,221
You have different things you can choices you can make with your decision.

44
00:02:48,221 --> 00:02:53,340
So in this simple example it might be to vaccinate or get supportive care.

45
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,210
Then someone can we can have uncertainties,

46
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:58,435
uncertainties are circles here, so

47
00:02:58,435 --> 00:03:03,270
we might be uncertain if someone is vaccinated if they'll get infected or not.

48
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:07,340
So the arms emanating from that are the outcomes of that uncertainty.

49
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:11,051
And so here we can see an example here where we might have multiple uncertainty.

50
00:03:11,051 --> 00:03:13,901
So someone's vaccinated, we don't know if they'll get infected.

51
00:03:13,901 --> 00:03:16,210
If they'll see the doctor, they'll go to the hospital.

52
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:21,206
The way I like this decision tree to sketch out your analysis because we can

53
00:03:21,206 --> 00:03:26,701
all now be very clear about what we are and we're not including in this analysis.

54
00:03:26,701 --> 00:03:30,641
So we know that we are only considering two decisions here vaccinate or

55
00:03:30,641 --> 00:03:31,721
supportive care.

56
00:03:31,721 --> 00:03:34,940
We're not considering six different types of vaccines or something.

57
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:37,828
We are considering whether someone will get infected,

58
00:03:37,828 --> 00:03:40,601
whether you'll see the doctor or go to the hospital.

59
00:03:40,601 --> 00:03:45,562
So those are some of the key resources will probably be using is doctor's visits

60
00:03:45,562 --> 00:03:46,540
at hospitals.

61
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:50,047
Notice, for example, I don't have anything here about adverse events or

62
00:03:50,047 --> 00:03:51,740
side effects from the vaccine.

63
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:55,341
So that means that this analysis is not considering those things.

64
00:03:55,341 --> 00:03:59,680
So when you sketch out a decision tree, you can be pretty clear and explicit and

65
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,890
with everyone on your team about what are we considering in this analysis and

66
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:08,440
how are all these things tied together?

67
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:13,023
And that's it for the basics of how to do your analysis.
