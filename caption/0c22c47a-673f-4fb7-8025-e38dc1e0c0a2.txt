1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:04,704
Alright, so the third enzyme that you'll notice I didn't really talk about PFK2,

2
00:00:04,704 --> 00:00:06,694
I spent like 25 minutes on it last year and

3
00:00:06,694 --> 00:00:10,610
I videotaped it me like pointing at things that you guys cannot see in a video.

4
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:14,270
If you're not sure about PFK2 from the notes, then please come and talk to me.

5
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:17,473
But we're going to move on to Pyruvate Kinase ,we'll ask it actually

6
00:00:17,473 --> 00:00:19,290
maybe the next 10 minutes.

7
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:23,190
Pyruvate Kinase is the last step right here in the red box.

8
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:25,610
So this is where PFK 2 was.

9
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:29,640
This is where Pyruvate Kinase and Glucokinase were.

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,040
And so it's going to regulate the last step.

11
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,620
So there's three steps of regulation of glycolysis.

12
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:35,390
This is the last one.

13
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:38,410
And it is regulated by three metabolites.

14
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:42,310
So ATP, which is just like how PFK1 is regulated.

15
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:46,305
So again, when you have lots of ATP, generally you're going to want to suppress

16
00:00:46,305 --> 00:00:50,600
glycolysis glycolysis makes ATP if you have lots of ATP, you don't need to do it.

17
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,181
Okay? So

18
00:00:51,181 --> 00:00:53,430
that's how that's going to work for them.

19
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:56,860
They're the fructose one, six bisphosphate.

20
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:00,140
That's a center of when you have a buildup of some of these upstream things.

21
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:04,590
So this is the product of PFK1 the enzyme that we just talked about.

22
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:06,378
So when you have a build up of that,

23
00:01:06,378 --> 00:01:09,440
it's going to feed forward to tell PK to speed up.

24
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:12,159
And so you can take this as you're at a traffic light, and

25
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,390
the light is definitely green and the guy who stopped in front of you is not moving.

26
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:18,890
And so that green line is your horn, right?

27
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:20,300
You're like speed up, move along.

28
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:21,200
We're ready to go.

29
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,276
Okay, last one's a little more complicated and that is Alanine, so Alanine is

30
00:01:26,276 --> 00:01:31,610
an amino acid, and it feeds back here to suppress the activity of Pyruvate Kinase.

31
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:34,910
Now you might think, well, why Alanine?

32
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:37,500
And so there's a couple of reasons why Alanine is important here.

33
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,881
So first of all, it's a really important amino acid catabolite, so when you break

34
00:01:41,881 --> 00:01:45,761
down amino acids, a lot of them all but three, eventually have something

35
00:01:45,761 --> 00:01:52,070
to do with Alanine levels are metabolized down to Alanine at least in part.

36
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,520
Where are we?

37
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,740
So here's an example.

38
00:01:54,740 --> 00:02:03,290
This is Alanine [INAUDIBLE] Alanine here is proximal to the Pirate Bay step.

39
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,310
Right here.

40
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:10,920
So Pyruvate and Alanine are interchangeable via this enzyme.

41
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,335
If you want to break down say for example, glutamate,

42
00:02:13,335 --> 00:02:15,930
you take glutamate it breaks down into Alanine.

43
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:20,948
If you want to break down aspartate it breaks down the glutamate which

44
00:02:20,948 --> 00:02:25,706
then breaks down to Alanine If you want to break down a spare gene,

45
00:02:25,706 --> 00:02:30,380
it breaks down to aspartate glutamate which breaks down.

46
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,850
So this is just an example.

47
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:34,809
We'll talk about amino acid oxidation in the next unit, but

48
00:02:34,809 --> 00:02:38,910
the Alanine is a really important sensor of how many amino acids you have.

49
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:42,427
So if we go back to this, when you have plenty of amino acids, and

50
00:02:42,427 --> 00:02:45,358
you can use amino acids as a substitute for fuel here,

51
00:02:45,358 --> 00:02:48,050
you're telling glycolysis to lay off, right?

52
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:51,552
So if you have enough amino acids that you can survive on for energy,

53
00:02:51,552 --> 00:02:54,450
you're telling the body to stop using glucose, okay?

54
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:57,637
You're telling it to use those amino acids instead.

55
00:02:57,637 --> 00:03:00,481
Is that clear?

56
00:03:00,481 --> 00:03:04,623
Any request before I move on?

57
00:03:04,623 --> 00:03:05,876
Lots of animation on this slide.

58
00:03:05,876 --> 00:03:08,289
>> [INAUDIBLE] >> Mm-hm.

59
00:03:08,289 --> 00:03:13,098
>> [INAUDIBLE] >> So all these slides with all

60
00:03:13,098 --> 00:03:16,860
this weird animation stuff, that'll all be posted too.

61
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,220
Okay, so you need to get that.

62
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:21,360
And like I said, don't worry about memorizing this pathway because we'll talk

63
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,643
about it like in seven lectures, >> Stop

64
00:03:26,643 --> 00:03:32,250
using glucose, >> Stop using glucose.

65
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:36,902
>> Yeah, >> Have amino acids which then could be

66
00:03:36,902 --> 00:03:38,896
>> Could be used instead

67
00:03:38,896 --> 00:03:43,170
>> So what is the reason for that?

68
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:47,229
Because the process to make energy out of mus is that shorter and

69
00:03:47,229 --> 00:03:50,496
more efficient than it would be >> I think its More of a case of supply

70
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:51,390
and demand.

71
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:54,300
So there's just in this case, it will be enough amino acids around that.

72
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,570
You might as well just use those.

73
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:57,633
Yeah. Glucose is definitely

74
00:03:57,633 --> 00:03:58,780
the preferential substrate.

75
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:02,200
If there's equal amounts, generally the body uses glucose.

76
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,114
Was there another [INAUDIBLE] okay.

77
00:04:04,114 --> 00:04:09,328
[NOISE] All right, just like pFk2 there's regulation by protein

78
00:04:09,328 --> 00:04:15,223
phosphorylation by Pyruvate Kinase, so this is sort of a bit confusing.

79
00:04:15,223 --> 00:04:17,980
This is the same sort of thing I had on the previous slide.

80
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:22,095
But when Adrenaline and Glucagon are present they cause phosphorylation,,

81
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:26,350
which then turns Pyruvate Kinase which then turns it off If you think about why

82
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:30,586
this is happening, and also why is this happening only in the liver,

83
00:04:30,586 --> 00:04:33,990
it's the same thing we just talked about for PFK-2.

84
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:35,050
So this is a summary.

85
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:36,660
Hopefully you guys have this slide, yeah.

86
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,789
So this is a summary of a bunch of the things we talked about,

87
00:04:38,789 --> 00:04:42,230
about the differences between liver and muscle and how these things are regulated.

88
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:45,380
Okay, sometimes depending on the biochemicals you talk, you may think of

89
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:49,410
these as sort of unitary processes that are regulated in the same everywhere.

90
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:53,410
But muscle and liver do totally different things, right.

91
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:53,624
Okay.
