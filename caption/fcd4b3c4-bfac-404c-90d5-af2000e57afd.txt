1
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:11,650
Yeah. Let's do that. But then if I'd like to play that, it'd be really play that little island.

2
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:17,610
Oh, yeah, yeah. That extra. Yeah, I know.

3
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:23,900
It's amazing. You know, you get.

4
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:32,790
Tickets separately. You can buy them, but all I have is a budget that I can keep afterwards.

5
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:39,470
Okay, we're. We're funny. We have plenty of others. Well.

6
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:48,530
Yeah. We've been finding this one as well. Those are, like, a lot more good.

7
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:56,250
The intelligence system works very well.

8
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:02,200
But. Yeah.

9
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:30,880
Yeah. I didn't want to come back to this idea that, oh, I didn't have something for the composers samples panel.

10
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:37,830
So I was like, He made it up.

11
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:42,010
So I know what we talked about before. We're going to make it promise.

12
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:47,760
Okay. So he's a surprise from the panel, but he's.

13
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:59,150
We kept being like. Now it's a campaign.

14
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,250
So. To make it so miserable.

15
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:14,560
And yet and then it was only during class, the class period and put them in the house and get open for Thursday and Friday.

16
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:18,430
Oh yeah. I think he did that for a Christian. Oh yeah.

17
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:41,960
And only for this one for 17 years. So. Science driven by science today has taken over 33 to 48 hours.

18
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:46,530
And so it's like it was like Thursday. Yeah. Yeah.

19
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:50,480
That wasn't enough. So he decided it was like, yeah.

20
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:57,430
To. Yeah.

21
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:07,670
Usually I used to take them out of sight. Yeah, they was the fire station man, and I literally don't want to miss it.

22
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,250
That's fine, I believe. Or something like that.

23
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:20,250
So at this point. Somewhere like joint distribution center.

24
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,750
I was like. You like those terms?

25
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:30,409
I was like, Yeah, actually, I was like, and then I was like, Yeah.

26
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:33,860
I mean, yeah, yeah.

27
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:38,280
It opens up in appetite. Yeah. It's like a two by two table, the larger sense.

28
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,350
But I don't. Yeah, but I feel like you purchased it. Like it was going to be really complicated.

29
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:53,569
You did. And that's why I was like, well, yeah, this is also my third instance is the first class.

30
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:59,520
And so I had to take an intro intro to like five shots for my undergrad with him.

31
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:06,920
I was like, you know, it's it was a guy who was in public health for nine years now.

32
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:11,840
It's like a very big really by the standards for public health majors.

33
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:21,350
And it's essentially the same schematic. Yeah, but it's definitely something that school starts in college and that was I mean,

34
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:26,959
again, yeah, we just got something like five years since I started college.

35
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:34,500
So like I see before especially I was like, I forget.

36
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:44,540
Okay. So you give us a hint.

37
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,070
We have that. Yeah. I was like, yeah, I didn't realize that first either.

38
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,500
I everything now the same. For what purpose?

39
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:13,430
A friend of mine was a staffer and she says, I have seen this before.

40
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:23,980
I was going to say it's an even bigger departure from me.

41
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:31,010
Yeah. And look at how people experience experiencing the same.

42
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:34,270
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

43
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:45,879
Like a43 something international. All right, guys, I'm going to start kind of on time today because we have two topics to go through today.

44
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:49,360
So that's kind of a busy class.

45
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,200
I'm going to also talk a little bit about the midterm.

46
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:59,350
I think I'm going to do that between the two lectures, just so that as people trickle in, they can kind of get that.

47
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:06,579
Hopefully I could get an answer on what was going on with Panopto last week, but I just started it manually.

48
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:10,570
It's all eyes seem to be on, so hopefully that will work fine.

49
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:15,040
Um, and the one, like I said from 717 worked fine.

50
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:19,540
So I don't think it was the Zoom issue or anything. But anyway, hopefully all will be well this time.

51
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:28,149
I think they think any housekeeping things well we'll talk in the middle in the between the two classes about the exam and stuff like that.

52
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:31,150
So we'll just start with this. All right.

53
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:35,500
So we're going to do two topics today. So have some relation to one another.

54
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:45,880
We're kind of finishing up our scenario of tissue injury, body response and resolution with our discussion of the resolution portion.

55
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:53,950
So that's going to be this morning talking about tissue regeneration, which obviously would be the ideal if you have tissue injury,

56
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:59,350
regenerating the tissue that was there before or kind of the failsafe mechanism

57
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,650
where you can't completely regenerate the tissue that was there before,

58
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:06,610
but you're going to repair it with some scarring or fibrosis. Okay.

59
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:10,209
So that's kind of an outcome of that scenario that we outlined.

60
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:18,850
And then we'll spend the second part talking about kind of a bizarre variation of tissue regeneration or tissue proliferation, which is neoplasia.

61
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:27,130
Okay. And like I said, we'll talk a little bit about the exam in between the two classes so we can accommodate people coming in a bit later.

62
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:31,790
Okay. So right.

63
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:35,860
Okay. So tissue regeneration, repair. So this is kind of the outcome.

64
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:42,040
So this is our, our sequence of tissue injury and resolution that we talked about before.

65
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:50,080
It's kind of been going through for the whole class, starting with normal tissue at the top and then some sort of injury or loss of cell integrity.

66
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:54,580
And we talked about how there's a body response to that because you have to clean up the mess.

67
00:07:54,580 --> 00:08:00,670
So we have inflammation where acutely you have an increase in vascular supply and permeability.

68
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:08,200
You have neutrophils the cells that come in and kind of dissolve the mess and then macrophages the help for clean up cells and clean up all of that.

69
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:12,669
That's the inflammatory response and you can sometimes get stuck in that.

70
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:17,110
BS Right, if you have continued injury. So you have another injury coming on top of that.

71
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:24,580
So that's chronic inflammation where you have recurrent injury, so you never get a chance to really progressive resolve it.

72
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:30,610
And then we talked about the transition from we're going to talk a little more about that today,

73
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:35,920
but we talked about the transition from an inflammatory response to the repair.

74
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:41,379
So there's a transitional phase that we'll talk about again today called granulation tissue.

75
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:49,120
So there's a number of cytokines involved in that. A transition phase is kind of building the scaffold for repair.

76
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:56,530
So there's an increase in fibroblasts and increase in blood vessels and a drop in the pro-inflammatory response.

77
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:00,340
And then hopefully you can have tissue regeneration.

78
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:08,530
So that's influenced by different cytokines or if the damage is too severe, you can kind of build a bridge and scar down the area.

79
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:15,910
So the other outcome could be increased collagen deposition, which is scar formation or fibrosis.

80
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,840
Okay. So those are the outcome, potential outcomes. That's the overview.

81
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:23,319
So we talked a little bit about this last time,

82
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:29,620
but a little bit more in-depth granulation tissue is said is a transitional phase between inflammation and outcome,

83
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:35,140
the outcome being either a regeneration of the original tissue or repair by scarring.

84
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:39,610
So overview of granulation tissue, what does it look like?

85
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:47,259
So here's an old ulcer of somebody's foot and it's showing an area of granulation tissue.

86
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:52,419
This is the epithelium on either side. And then we have an area where there's increased collagen.

87
00:09:52,420 --> 00:10:00,670
If we were at high magnification, we could see increased vessels and ideally the epithelium is going to grow over that damaged area.

88
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:07,150
And in the early stages of the repair process, granulation tissue, as I said, is a transition phase.

89
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:15,729
It's kind of washed out. But in early stages of regulation tissue, you have increased fibroblasts and loose collagen.

90
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:19,060
So you're trying to build that scaffold, build the extracellular matrix.

91
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:23,860
These are tri crown stains and they stain collagen as blue.

92
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,790
This is a bit washed out and appears better probably on your computer screen,

93
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:32,859
but there's little strands of blue, but it's not a whole, you know, sheet of blue.

94
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:36,850
So there's little strands of blue in here and lots and lots of red things, which are the blood vessels.

95
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:41,680
So we have a very vascularized area bringing nutrients to the tissue.

96
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:47,290
We have little strands of collagen building that extracellular matrix and we have macrophages present.

97
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:52,180
But here their role is to downregulate inflammation and promote repair.

98
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:57,879
Okay. And so one potential outcome is regeneration.

99
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:07,480
Another potential outcome where you cannot regenerate the epithelium is the scar, the area that is an increase in collagen.

100
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,260
So now with the special try from STEM, we have sort of a sheet of blue.

101
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:15,580
These are all collagen dense collagen fibers. That's essentially a scar.

102
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,840
There's actually a downregulation of the blood vessels, your decrease of the blood vessels.

103
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:26,740
So one potential outcome is a scar. And the scar can be very large or very small, depending on the nature of the wound.

104
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:31,450
Okay. So it may or may not have a large functional impact.

105
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:35,080
Okay. Here is just kind of a little warning slide.

106
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:40,990
Some of the words that we use in pathology, unfortunately, sound very much alike, even though they have little to nothing to do with each other.

107
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,500
So here's a warning. Watch out for some pathology satellites.

108
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:49,090
We're talking about granulation tissue, which is an intermediary stage.

109
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:52,120
And injury repair has those three components.

110
00:11:53,710 --> 00:12:01,840
Earlier in the inflammatory lecture, we talked about granulomas inflammation, which is a macrophage dominant form of inflammation.

111
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:05,830
Okay, these are totally different things. They sound kind of similar.

112
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:13,929
And so that becomes unfortunate. And an exam situation when you write one and mean the other that just to give you kind of a heads

113
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:19,480
up that granulation tissue is that intermediary stage between inflammation and resolution.

114
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:25,660
Granuloma tests, inflammation or granulomas are particular types of inflammation.

115
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:29,440
Okay. Sorry that they sound alike. That's just the way that it is.

116
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:36,160
It's the warning sign going back to granulation tissue, that intermediary phase.

117
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:41,980
We said there's a macrophage phenotypic change during granulation tissue.

118
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:48,460
So in the early stages of inflammation, we have classically activated macrophages.

119
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:54,430
So these are like the resident macrophages and tissue or macrophages that might be recruited to the site of an injury.

120
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:58,180
And those are pro-inflammatory macrophages.

121
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:03,850
So there's the site of kind of like L one and all 12 that promote the inflammatory response.

122
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:07,840
So their job is to be the cleanup cells of the body, phagocytosis, the mess.

123
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:16,660
But in general, they're part of inflammation. And during the granulation tissue phase, you've got to stop kind of the damaged phase.

124
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:22,270
So there's a phenotypic sweat switch to alternatively activated macrophages.

125
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:25,630
So broadly, we refer to those as M2 macrophages,

126
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:32,440
and they actually produce cytokines like IL ten that are down regulatory for the inflammatory response.

127
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:42,640
And they also produce cytokines like TGF beta which activates fibroblasts because now we need to start creating the extracellular matrix scaffold.

128
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:52,960
Okay. So m2 macrophages downregulate inflammation and promote extracellular matrix remodeling in preparation for repair.

129
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,260
So that's a nice simple concept. In reality, I think we alluded to before.

130
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:03,130
M2 macrophages are really very, very heterogenous.

131
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:07,180
So macrophages in general are very phenotypic, diverse cells.

132
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:13,000
So they are a little bit different from the cells, from tissue type to tissue type and in different stages.

133
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:18,190
So M1 macrophages are traditionally the inflammatory macrophages.

134
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:25,420
And then this diagram shows you all these different subtypes of what are considered M2 macrophages.

135
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:31,930
And so they can have different cytokine profiles, different gene expression profiles depending on their particular role.

136
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:42,100
In general, they're doing something else other than strictly inflammatory responses, but M2 macrophages can be very different.

137
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:49,990
So in this class, we're just going to think about that broad concept of a pro-inflammatory and one macrophage at an M2 macrophage,

138
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:53,590
which is downregulated inflammation and building towards repair.

139
00:14:54,010 --> 00:15:01,250
But just be aware in different tissue types and a different processes, there's a lot of variety in M2 macrophages.

140
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:06,730
So things like in tumors, sometimes people refer to these as tumor associated macrophages.

141
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:12,040
That's a variety of up to a macrophage that has a role in the response to tumors.

142
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:18,280
Okay, so just if reality's a little bit more complex, but it's still a useful concept to think about that phenotypic switch.

143
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:23,770
Okay. This is another reminder of that switch of cytokines.

144
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:29,410
So this is an experimental example of a injury healing experiment in mice.

145
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:36,430
So looking just at the open circles, which are the control mice at this particular experiment with normal healing in the.

146
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,290
Early phases of inflammation.

147
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:48,860
I got day four where the red arrows showing you an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines, so an increase from baseline of pro-inflammatory cytokines.

148
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:56,990
But by day ten or 13, those pro-inflammatory cytokines are down and you switch to an aisle tan related phenotype.

149
00:15:57,770 --> 00:16:08,030
So the temporal order of those and the control when one goes up goes down is pretty pivotal towards a successful resolution response.

150
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:16,190
So if you have dysregulation of that sort of timing, you can have inhibition of healing or a disruption in the process of healing.

151
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:24,740
Okay. So it's pretty tightly controlled as to when all these cells kind of come into play and alter that cytokine response.

152
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:35,300
Okay. So another thing that happens within the granulation tissue phase that I talked about is angiogenesis or new blood vessel formation.

153
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:39,020
So this kind of an overview of how that happens.

154
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:48,230
So there's a growth factor called vegetative endothelial growth factor that has a lot of different production sites.

155
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:55,010
It can be present in tissue and derive from or produced by endothelial cells or the cells lining blood vessels,

156
00:16:55,460 --> 00:17:00,890
platelets, smooth muscle cells that gobble cells like fibroblasts and also macrophages.

157
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:07,550
And interestingly, this factor is most important in that granulation tissue phase.

158
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:13,880
So its role there is going to be to stimulate new blood vessel formation, but its formation starts earlier.

159
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:20,280
So from the very first stages of injury, the body's already kind of setting the stage for repair.

160
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:27,830
Because one of the triggering factors for increasing the production of BGF is actually histamine.

161
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:32,740
So you remember histamine in the rolling diagram that caused the vasodilation.

162
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:39,710
It caused some change in distribution of growth of receptors on the endothelial cells.

163
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:45,100
One of the other things it does is increase the production of VEGF, which comes into play.

164
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:53,360
It's all it's a very good dietary factor, but it also comes into play during the transition phase and its role is to actually stimulate

165
00:17:53,360 --> 00:18:00,290
reorganization of the extracellular matrix and allow new blood vessels to sprout from existing vessels.

166
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:08,420
So production of VEGF does things like stimulate activity and production of matrix metallic proteases.

167
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:13,430
So these guys dissolve portions of the bismuth membrane.

168
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:16,790
So here's a quiescent vessel just fighting its own business.

169
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:20,930
Now it has vasodilation under the activity of histamine of Jeff.

170
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:26,480
And we actually get a separation or a dissolution of the basement membrane away from the outside of the vessel.

171
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:31,940
And then cells that live the outside of the small vessel called parasites detach.

172
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:38,089
And that allows differentiation of an endothelial based stem cell to kind of pull out.

173
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:42,770
You get a tip cell leading from the extent of that original vessel.

174
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:48,890
And from there, you'll have proliferation of new endothelial cells,

175
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:57,970
and you'll create a vascular stock that's oriented perpendicularly, separate perpendicularly to the original vessels.

176
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:07,819
So if you remember back our picture of granulation tissue, one of the things that I said is that there's lots of blood vessels and they're oriented.

177
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:11,210
Their orientation is perpendicular to the fibroblasts.

178
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:17,240
So all of a sudden, granulation tissue, you'll see all these vascular profiles sort of heading straight out of the tissue.

179
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:23,750
And that's related to the proliferation of these vascular stocks between existing vessels.

180
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,890
Okay. So you have the proliferation is vascular stock.

181
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:32,210
You get some mesenchymal cells lining up and there is a new blood vessel.

182
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:38,870
Now, these are not the same in terms of maturity as the original blood vessels.

183
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:40,430
They tend to be very leaky.

184
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:48,680
So going back to our example of, you know, when you were a kid and you injured for me and it was like scabbing up, that tissue tended to bleed a lot.

185
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:53,240
So because of all this vasculature, because these are fragile blood vessels,

186
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:58,250
granulation tissue, they're fragile vessels, and it can tend to have a lot of hemorrhage,

187
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:03,410
but they're sort of intentionally leaky because it's a way to easily provide a lot of nutrients,

188
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:09,980
a lot of oxygenation, a lot of growth factors that are needed for the reconstruction of the tissue.

189
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:14,959
So it's kind of fragile, leaky vessels in the area. So initially, they're leaky.

190
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:19,520
They're highly permeable. But that's that's fine during this kind of reorganization phase.

191
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:25,340
But what eventually happens as the injury resolves is that these new blood vessels were regressed.

192
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:32,719
So you have increase blood vessels that's going to go back down and the ones that remain become more stable.

193
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,140
So they're less leaky. Okay. Regulation bad.

194
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:43,799
Very vascularized, kind of leaky kind of an area of a lot of remodeling that a scar tissue is actually kind of the opposite.

195
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:48,300
It's not prone to hemorrhage or anything like that. It's just more more collagen.

196
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:56,370
Okay. So it's kind of a construction phase. So VEGF is the main cytokine that it forces blood vessels.

197
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:07,209
TGF beta on the other hand, which is also present during this regulation tissue phase, is a site of time that triggers fibroblast or myofibroblasts,

198
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:13,710
which are cells that have aspects of smooth muscle function and fibroblasts triggers their proliferation and activation.

199
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:19,350
And these are the cells that are involved in production of extracellular matrix components.

200
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:29,040
So they're the construction workers and they're going to remodel and redesign the extracellular matrix so that if we're in an epithelial tissue,

201
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:38,280
there's a scaffold for the epithelial cells to grow over. Okay, so TGF beta signals, fibroblast myofibroblasts proliferation and activation.

202
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:47,640
And this in turn results in the production of other extracellular matrix remodeling cytokines and the two major categories.

203
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:54,050
There's lots of them, but there are two major categories called the Metallo Matrix, Metallo, Proteases or MMP,

204
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:59,880
and that the inhibitors of the teleprompter cases are the tips do a kind of a balance

205
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:04,079
and you kind of need both of them to think if you're remodeling a house or something,

206
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,240
you need to build a scaffold that you take that down.

207
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:15,120
So the matrix metallic proteases favor regeneration because their role is to degrade or to take away extracellular matrix.

208
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:24,870
So if you think scar tissue is a lot of ECM with a matrix patella protease, they're going to kind of decrease the likelihood of scar tissue formation.

209
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:35,280
So you have to kind of remove some of that. So epithelial cells will will fill the gap and the inhibitors of metallic proteases favor fibrosis or

210
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:40,560
collagen deposition because they deactivate or they decrease the activity of the metallic proteases.

211
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:45,240
So this kind of building and construction needs to balance each other out a bit.

212
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:51,750
So what does let's pretend that it didn't work that well, we have some fibrosis or scarring.

213
00:22:51,750 --> 00:23:00,900
What does that look like? As we said, there's a cytokine balance during the granulation tissue phase that affects outcome of regeneration or repair.

214
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:08,770
So TGF beta induces fibroblast activation and we have some regeneration related factors like MMP,

215
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:12,900
we have some pro fibrotic factors that favor collagen deposition.

216
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:17,309
So this is a little bit of an oversimplistic explanation, right?

217
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:23,190
Because in reality it can be both, but predominance of one or the other can favor different outcomes.

218
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:28,260
So here on the right hand side is an HD stain of what scarring looks like.

219
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:32,220
So this is just the skin at the site of a surgical scar.

220
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:37,410
D stands for Dermis, so that's just the normal collagen underlying the epidermis.

221
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:41,939
And then in the middle we have a little alteration of the collagen, so it's pretty low.

222
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:49,050
That image, it's hard to see, but there is more dense collagen and less of the normal structures like blood vessels.

223
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:53,910
If there were, this is a really very hard skin, but if there were hair follicles, there would be less here.

224
00:23:54,190 --> 00:24:02,700
So it's basically like a bridge of collagen in the area where the wound was so alteration of collagen, usually more dense collagen.

225
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:11,190
And if you stayed with the tried crop, which since collagen blue, you're going to see an increased area of bull that's fibrosis scarring.

226
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:17,370
Unfortunately, here we have some more pathology sound effects. Just a little heads up for you.

227
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:26,310
So when we talked about acute inflammation and we talked about hemorrhage, you use the word fibrin.

228
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:31,680
So fibrin is the end product of the coagulation cascade.

229
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:36,480
So when you have an injury that injures a blood vessel, you have a series of enzymatic reactions,

230
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:45,780
and then there's a pro protein called Brannigan, and it gets broken down and you get smaller subunits called fibrin that are cross-linked.

231
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:53,430
So that's a clot, right? So fibrin is the end product of the coagulation cascade and its function is to stop hemorrhage.

232
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:57,750
So create a clot or a thrombus. This is always an acute process.

233
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:05,880
And remember we said one type of inflammation, if you're in mucosa or an area where there's a lot of blood vessels is debonis inflammation.

234
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:09,570
I showed you that horrible picture of the cow with all that yellow stuff on it.

235
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:17,550
So that's an acute process, an acute inflammatory process, fibrous, which unfortunately sounds very, very similar.

236
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:24,900
Fibrous is referring to scar tissue or the deposition of collagen as the end product of tissue repair.

237
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:28,740
So this is happening of a chronic stage of injury repair.

238
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,480
Its function is to repair tissue.

239
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:39,420
So the value of the process that we refer to as fibrosis, which means the deposition of collagen in the process of scarring.

240
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:44,729
Okay, these are very different things. They sound very similar.

241
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:48,780
And unfortunately, an example is people who got tripped up and superimposed up.

242
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:53,090
So just watch out for that because they're out. Really? Completely different things.

243
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:57,470
Okay. So that. All right.

244
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:01,100
So we talked about fibrosis as a potential outcome to injury.

245
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:05,330
Let's talk a little bit about regeneration or restoration of the damaged tissue.

246
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:13,190
So different tissues, as it turns out, have different capacities for regeneration or for proliferation.

247
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:18,050
So we can kind of divide the body tissues depending on the likelihood that they're

248
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:22,730
able to successfully divide and replenish themselves in the face of injury.

249
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:29,860
So we have labial tissues that kind of have a high turnover ordinarily.

250
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:37,579
So they have cells that are continuously dividing. So a lot of times these are cells that are either exposed to the outside.

251
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:44,090
So like your skin has a continuous cycle of dividing the gastrointestinal tract has a continuous cycle of dividing,

252
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:48,080
or there are cells that have a function where some of them are going to be destroyed.

253
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:53,399
So like hematopoietic tissue, like neutrophils, I told you, go into tissue and get destroyed.

254
00:26:53,400 --> 00:27:01,040
So you need kind of a certain level of turnover. So those are labial tissues that continuously divide fast replicating cells.

255
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:09,830
Then we have tissues that are mostly stable. But in the face of an injury or in the face of a stimulus, they have the ability to divide.

256
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:14,600
So those are quiescent tissues, possibly stable. You don't want them proliferating all the time.

257
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:18,170
But if there is an injury, they have a good capacity to regenerate.

258
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:27,440
Okay. So those are things like liver and kidney, some other glandular organs, endothelial cells of the cells lining blood vessels.

259
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:31,640
These are cohesive tissues that have the ability to divide with stimulus.

260
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:39,830
And then we have a category of tissues that are terminally differentiated and at least in adulthood, are not dividing.

261
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:47,420
So these are permanent tissues. So those are things like neurons, skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle.

262
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:58,370
So these are all tissues that have very limited and in some respects kind of nonexistent regenerative capacity, at least in adulthood.

263
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:07,040
So a couple of things about those permanent tissues. These tend to be tissues that are really highly dependent on cell to cell interactions.

264
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:12,260
So even though there are individual cells, the cells have to act as one large unit.

265
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:17,030
So they have strong cell to cell context.

266
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:19,100
So think like a muscle cell.

267
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:29,300
If you have the heart, you have the internal intercalated disks which are areas of contact from one cardiac monocyte to another.

268
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:35,840
So if you have an electrical impulse in the pacemaker cell, it's going to spread very quickly to all the cells as a whole,

269
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:39,410
and that's dependent on those close connections between the membrane.

270
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:47,510
So we think if a cell needs to proliferate, to regenerate, to regenerate a tissue, the first thing it has to do is divide, right?

271
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:53,090
And so it has to detach to some degree from its neighbor, replicate itself, and then reform those attachments.

272
00:28:53,810 --> 00:29:01,100
And it is cell in a tissue at the heart. You can't really have the cardiac lysates detaching from one another, doing their thing and then reattaching.

273
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:06,130
So for tissues where the cell to cell interactions are like neurons, you know,

274
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:11,120
you form neural networks or they're connected, you can't really be breaking apart those synapses and reforming them.

275
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:16,500
So these tend to be tissues that in a mature form don't really have the capacity to do that.

276
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:19,670
They're permanently post mitotic, terminally differentiated tissues.

277
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:24,230
Okay. There's always exceptions to everything.

278
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:30,860
So in the brain, for example, there is the existence of neural stem cells in certain areas.

279
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:38,420
So particularly in certain organisms, like some amphibians, some birds,

280
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:46,910
there are there is some potential for these stem cells to become active and replace neurons in mammals, particularly in the central nervous system.

281
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:50,570
That capacity is essentially nonexistent in adulthood.

282
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:55,040
And we're going to talk more about that when we do our nervous system lecture in the second part of the class.

283
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:59,800
But essentially, from a practical standpoint, these are permanent, not dividing tissues.

284
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:05,690
That doesn't necessarily mean that they have no capacity for repair.

285
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:14,060
So we're going to get back to that in just a minute after we talk about the quiescent tissues, how those permanent tissues deal with injury.

286
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:24,709
Okay. But for the most part, when we think of tissues that regenerate in response to injury, we have kind of a set sequence of events that occur.

287
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:27,980
So let's look at quiescent tissues and how they regenerate.

288
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,380
So it would be things like the liver or the kidney.

289
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:38,659
So a lot of organs that are very important in terms of toxicology and toxicant related injury, the requisite tissues to regenerate.

290
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:42,770
So let's think about the liver, a good example. They basically have two options.

291
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:47,300
You can have reentry of mature cells into the cell cycle.

292
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:54,770
So we have the tissue they're not normally dividing, but those cells can kind of rev up and reenter the cell cycle or so.

293
00:30:54,770 --> 00:31:02,429
Those are mature, differentiated cells. Or you can have activation of tissue stem cells which are not differentiated cells.

294
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:07,249
They're kind of the reserve cells in the tissue. So they're not really functioning as regular hepatocytes.

295
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:11,809
They're just kind of sitting there waiting to fulfill the role of a reserve cell.

296
00:31:11,810 --> 00:31:20,870
So those are the two potentials. This is an example of the capacity of some of those quiescent tissues to regenerate.

297
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:26,120
So this is an example if you've heard of living donor experiments or experiments

298
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:30,560
like it's not experimental now living donor procedures for like a liver transplant,

299
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:34,489
the liver has an incredible capacity to regenerate.

300
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:40,850
And so it's actually possible to remove up to 60%, which seems somewhat astonishing,

301
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:47,420
60% of a donor liver to use as a donor level for an email compatible recipient.

302
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:54,410
So the image there is kind of cartoon style showing removal of a large part of a draft of a mouse,

303
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:58,550
but showing the removal of a large section of liver. So this is the remaining world.

304
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:05,030
And then the quiescent cells, the remaining lobe will be stimulated to reenter the cell cycle.

305
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:08,120
And very quickly, almost like you could see it grow,

306
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:16,070
those quiescent cells will replicate to the extent that the liver mass can be regenerated within a one month of that removal.

307
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,600
It's kind of astonishing.

308
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:30,740
So the picture on the right is a city of coral looking sort of straight down and cross-section from a living donor procedure.

309
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:36,800
So this is the liver. This part that's outlined was removed to serve as the donor lobe.

310
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,899
This is the remaining section.

311
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:48,980
So it kind of looks like one piece here, one piece here, and then one month later, you have regeneration essentially of the same volume of liver.

312
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:56,480
Okay? By one month of note, it regenerates the mass through the volume, but not the same form.

313
00:32:56,750 --> 00:33:00,380
So it doesn't completely replicate the same shape of the tissues before.

314
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:07,430
But the functional mass is equivalent. Okay, so we have tissues like liver that have a tremendous capacity for regeneration.

315
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,190
So what are they doing or how are they doing this?

316
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:20,960
So they're option one or the first thing that happens is cell cycle reentry by quiescent, mature, but not segment cells.

317
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:29,360
Okay. So both in aquatic tissue, this is our typical diagram of the cell cycle going through the phases of synthesis,

318
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:32,750
mitotic division, but in a quick succession.

319
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:40,640
Most of the cells are not in this cycle. They're not essentially they've stepped out of the cell cycle and are not replicating.

320
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:50,270
But in the face of injury, some of the very same cytokines that set the stage for the injury response start to prime this site,

321
00:33:50,270 --> 00:34:00,620
these cells to reenter the cycle. So if you remember TANF and the final six, those are early acute inflammatory stage cybercrimes.

322
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:05,360
They had a lot of effects that on again on epithelial cells or leukocytes.

323
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:13,010
But one of the other things that they do is they Prime Ji not cells to start producing growth factor receptors on

324
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:19,760
their surface so that hepatocyte doesn't have a lot of growth factor receptors under the influence of terrestrial sex,

325
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:27,240
it'll start to express growth. Back to receptors and then under the influence of growth factors present during that granulation tissue phase,

326
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:30,830
now those cells are going to be stimulated to react to the cycle.

327
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:38,400
Okay, so here's like kind of an example of the liver. These are hepatocytes have a chain together.

328
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:43,140
This is a macrophage called the Cooper cells, the tissue resident macrophage of the liver.

329
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:49,920
Under the influence of IL six, the hepatocytes are going to start to express growth factors on their surface,

330
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:55,590
which allows them to respond to growth factors present during the granulation tissue phase.

331
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:59,610
And then those mature differentiated cells will undergo cell division.

332
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:08,490
So response cytokines already start to prime hepatocytes for cell cycle reentry and then they're able to fulfill their role.

333
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:18,630
So that growth factor binding back in maybe to injury lecture, we talked about growth of receptors and transduction pathways.

334
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,730
Many of the growth factors act through tyrosine kinase receptors,

335
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:30,120
which activates a whole downstream cascade of intracellular mediators and results

336
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:35,910
in production of cells that aid a gene that AIDS cell cycle progression.

337
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:47,029
Okay. So that happens like in that in that scenario of the liver donor experiment that I talked about for mature cells,

338
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:53,690
growth factors, stimulation tends to lead to one or two proliferation cycles and then the cell returns to its present state.

339
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:59,210
Right. So you don't want the liver to just keep going. That would be uncontrolled. You want to have some control of this.

340
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:03,920
So there's a limit to how much of cycles of replication will occur.

341
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:10,310
And it's still pretty poorly understood. I mean, that's a lot of replication of the liver sort of regenerate within a month.

342
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:14,840
It's still pretty poorly understood. What factors control termination of that safely.

343
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:21,590
However, not good time to introduce the concept of checkpoints in the cell cycle.

344
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:25,430
So this is again our diagram of the cell cycle.

345
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:32,419
And we know that there are two major checkpoints that allow it's another form of control of that proliferation cycle,

346
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:37,820
because obviously you don't want the cell to go forward in replication if there are errors.

347
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:45,170
Right. So we have two checkpoints. We have a G1 checkpoint that allows the cell to check for DNA damage.

348
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:51,020
And if damage is present, it can temporarily arrest the cell cycle and initiate repair.

349
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:56,420
Okay. So we do things like mismatch repair or removal of damaged areas of DNA.

350
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:04,250
And then after synthesis, there's another checkpoint, the G2, M checkpoint before the cell actually divides,

351
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:08,840
which is kind of a last ditch opportunity to check again for damage.

352
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:15,230
What happens in this case, if you do have areas of damage, is there tends to be arrest of the cell cycle.

353
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:19,610
So we have checkpoint proteins here that can initiate apoptosis.

354
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:28,310
Okay. So there are two checkpoints possible. So as we're proliferating the liver, for example, we're going to if everything's working normally,

355
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:34,130
we'll be checking for areas of damage and arresting replication of an individual cell if those exist.

356
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:38,540
So that's replication of existing cell populations.

357
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:46,160
Option two, if there has been severe damage and the existing hepatocytes or whatever the cell type is are not up to,

358
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:51,020
the challenge is you can activate tissue step cells or progenitor cells in the tissue.

359
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,750
Okay, so we did option one priming and proliferation of remaining quiescent parasites.

360
00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:02,479
Option two is hepatobiliary stem cells in the liver.

361
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,900
These are called normal cells. We'll see the people. We show you the liver.

362
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:12,080
These are tissue stem cells that ordinarily, you know, they're not functioning as as a in terms of parasites,

363
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:17,090
but under the influence of severe injury, they're going to enter the baseline hepatocyte pool.

364
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:24,090
It's kind of a reserve population and importantly, they are stem cells.

365
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:31,469
So unlike if you have a differentiated fat effect that divides the end point of that, it's to get to equivalent cells, right?

366
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:38,900
It's just replicating itself. A stem cell is an undifferentiated cell and it has one property of asymmetric division.

367
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:46,250
So when it divides itself, it's got to recreate one undifferentiated stem cell and then one differentiate itself.

368
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:53,900
Okay. So it's a fundamental difference with a stem cell and a differentiated cell that undergoes replication.

369
00:38:54,420 --> 00:39:00,350
Okay. So this has to be very controlled as well because you want to make sure your functional cells come

370
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:06,510
out of it and you don't want to have a lot of undifferentiated cells repeatedly proliferating.

371
00:39:06,770 --> 00:39:11,450
And that'll come into play a little bit later. When we talk about pleasure. Okay.

372
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:19,100
So progenitor cell activation can occur with severe injury or if there's a loss of a significant proportion of the hepatic tarantula.

373
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:25,580
So that context of the liver donor experiment or if you have a large amount of damage from a toxicant.

374
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:32,720
Here's one example that will come back to with the rook, with the liver of lecture in rodents activation.

375
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:37,010
They're a little bit more prone than we are activation of this over cell population.

376
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:43,310
So they tend to have activity of stem cells with less injury than you would for a human.

377
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:49,729
And that comes into play in translational biology because it's one of the reasons why liver

378
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:58,160
tumors are actually a pretty common outcome of toxicant exposure or of carcinogens in rodents.

379
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:04,639
And part of it is because their oval cell population is more likely to proliferate in response to injury.

380
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:11,000
So they're kind of really prone, very sensitive species for detecting hepatocellular damage.

381
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:19,310
Okay, so that's quills of tissues are two options mature differentiated cells reentering the cell cycle

382
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:26,450
or are all the cell population coming in and supplementing going back to our permanent tissues?

383
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:36,230
What are their options? Much more limited. So skeletal muscle, so bile fibers, which is the word that means just muscle cells.

384
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:44,650
These are post mitotic cells. So the individual cells are not able to do what the hepatocytes do and react to the cell cycle and proliferate.

385
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:52,870
So if you consider it on a cell to cell on a cellular, individual cellular level, they're not able to divide by issue.

386
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:58,570
But skeletal muscle as a tissue can regenerate for a couple of reasons.

387
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:06,460
One is that skeletal muscle fibers are really long. So if you damage one end of it, it doesn't necessarily kill the whole cell.

388
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:13,030
You know, if you damage the plasma membrane, it can kind of seal off adjacent to the damage that limits damage to the rest of the cell.

389
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:17,500
And there are multiple nucleated cells, special cells.

390
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:26,230
So in some of the muscle, there are cells adjacent to the viral fibers that are essentially the tissue stem cells are the reserve cells.

391
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:31,540
They're undifferentiated. They're not functioning as bio fibers. They can proliferate.

392
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:35,800
And what they actually do is then fuze with the existing moral fiber.

393
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:44,620
So they're kind of contributing their cellular mass to it to reform that bio fiber, to confuse we form the tube,

394
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:52,209
infiltrate the damage by fiber and that the actual like if I were to transect a moral fiber that helps reform the tube,

395
00:41:52,210 --> 00:42:00,070
the actual site, the junction between those two damaged ends, you actually do get some collagen deposition and scarring.

396
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:06,910
So you might have a small area that used to be a straight bio fiber that has a little bit of excess collagen in it.

397
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:15,520
So skeletal muscle regeneration involves both regeneration by these tissue stem cells and scarring and fibrosis.

398
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:21,610
The cow looks like this. Oh, God, that's really washed out. I hope it looks better from there.

399
00:42:21,610 --> 00:42:29,620
But essentially, this is supposed to be a diagram at the top of a tube, kind of like a weird parallelogram shape.

400
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:33,219
And at the center, you're imagining that we're cutting through the bio fibers.

401
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:38,380
There's an injury. The little gray area is the ends of the injured bio fibers.

402
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:44,800
So that's the area of necrosis. So you get kind of a die, a little bit of edge of damage at the edge of the cut, male fibers,

403
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:49,750
macrophages, the helpful kind of cells of the body come in and clean up that damaged area.

404
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:54,470
And then we have a problem. This is really hard to see from the diagram hopefully you see on your screen.

405
00:42:55,460 --> 00:43:04,150
Sorry. The adjacent satellite cells, which are undifferentiated tissue, stem cells, then proliferate and fuzed with the bio fibers.

406
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:11,430
So you're kind of regenerating that tube area. And then there's collagen deposition right at the edge of that area of injury.

407
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:17,230
So essentially what you're getting is a new bio tenderness junction.

408
00:43:17,530 --> 00:43:23,829
So tendon is connective tissue and usually you'll have between a, you know, a muscle and a bone,

409
00:43:23,830 --> 00:43:30,850
you have a ligaments, which is a connective tissue connection between muscle and other muscle or soft tissue.

410
00:43:30,850 --> 00:43:36,880
You'll have tendons. So this is forming like a miniature area of connective tissue in that area of junction.

411
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:43,540
So moral fiber regeneration involves reconstruction of the edges of the damaged cells and a tiny bit of scar.

412
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:48,670
So the goal and muscle injury, obviously, you don't want that scarring to be too extensive.

413
00:43:49,270 --> 00:43:54,880
Right, because that's not going to be an active area of contraction. It doesn't have the same contractile properties as muscle.

414
00:43:55,210 --> 00:43:58,810
So the goal is to minimize the degree of that. Okay.

415
00:44:00,190 --> 00:44:06,100
And the nerve cells are the other cells that don't have a great capacity to regenerate, particularly in the central nervous system.

416
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:13,310
But at the periphery, they can do a similar thing. So this is showing the interpreter of a bunch of nerve cells.

417
00:44:13,330 --> 00:44:16,990
So, you know, a nerve cell has a law extending process called an axle.

418
00:44:17,410 --> 00:44:20,920
So it's one cell, but it has a long cytoplasmic process.

419
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:27,550
So if you have injury, the distal part of or the furthest back part of that axon has got a degenerate.

420
00:44:28,450 --> 00:44:31,780
And then you can have that.

421
00:44:31,810 --> 00:44:34,930
So this is still one cell. Just the end of it has been damaged.

422
00:44:35,410 --> 00:44:40,930
But you'll have sprouting. So additional cytoplasmic processes from the undamaged area of the cell.

423
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:47,710
And then there are cell. This is a depicting a neuron with a violent sheath.

424
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:56,170
So there are other cells sort of rebuild that violent shape. And then you can have regeneration of the distal aspect of that neuronal process.

425
00:44:57,070 --> 00:45:02,530
Okay. If you kill the whole neuron, like the entire neuron dies back, that cell can't be replaced.

426
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:06,310
So you have to rely on redundancy as if there were remaining undamaged neurons.

427
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:11,890
But at the peripheral nervous system, you can to some degree regenerate the distal aspects of neurons.

428
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:20,410
Okay, so then finally. So we talked about how the different cells can repair what determines the final outcome,

429
00:45:20,590 --> 00:45:24,400
whether we have regeneration of damaged tissue or repair by scarring.

430
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:37,210
So there are two main factors. One key is the extent of extracellular matrix damage or the extent of extracellular matrix reorganization.

431
00:45:38,770 --> 00:45:42,820
Okay. So here's the liver again. I'm going to talk about this in more detail when we do liver.

432
00:45:43,090 --> 00:45:51,580
But the liver has a very kind of controlled structure with cords of hepatocytes separated by a small blood vessels called sinusoidal.

433
00:45:52,090 --> 00:45:56,920
So it's very organized. And if there is damage.

434
00:45:57,070 --> 00:46:01,650
So in this in this diagram, we have depth of so big things are a parasite.

435
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:09,160
We have loss of some hepatocytes. But here that extracellular scaffold, the blue stuff is still kind of preserved.

436
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:14,530
Right. So we still have kind of a track of where the epithelial cells should go.

437
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:21,490
So as long as we have preservation of that basement membrane and preservation of that extracellular matrix,

438
00:46:21,490 --> 00:46:24,730
the parasites that proliferate kind of know where to be. So they get.

439
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:28,690
Okay, we'll just follow this track, replicate, repopulate the courts.

440
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:35,810
If, on the other hand, we have such severe damage that we lose that track.

441
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:41,180
Right. So now we just have kind of random connective tissue strands going every which way.

442
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:44,870
There's no guide or template for the hepatocytes to follow.

443
00:46:45,550 --> 00:46:51,400
So in the extracellular matrix here, as the fibroblasts are dividing and activating,

444
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:58,870
you're going to have kind of random deposition of extracellular matrix and the parasites are going to be the growth clusters or not grow at all.

445
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:02,470
And here is where you're likely to have fibrosis or scarring.

446
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:06,460
Okay. To the extent of extracellular matrix, damage is important.

447
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:12,430
And then the other factor that's important is how much re epithelial ization you need

448
00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:18,270
to do is you're trying to cover the defect by proliferation of epithelial cells,

449
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:22,300
but there's a limit to how extensively that can happen.

450
00:47:22,630 --> 00:47:25,750
And a good example of that is healing is like a surgical wound.

451
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:29,890
So, you know, if you get a cut or a laceration, there are two ways of repairing it.

452
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:36,040
If you get to the physician within a certain period of time, they can repair it by primary intention to clean up your wound.

453
00:47:36,370 --> 00:47:45,910
And they suture the two edges of that room together. So in the next picture, looking at the pictures, far right area of injury, they suture together.

454
00:47:45,970 --> 00:47:48,430
It's a very small little gap here. Okay.

455
00:47:48,730 --> 00:47:53,860
And there are the epithelial cells, all the processes we talked about, you know, there's tissue damage in here.

456
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:57,730
So there's inflammation. There is granulation tissue. Everything is happening here.

457
00:47:58,090 --> 00:48:02,020
And eventually the epithelial cells just have to go block and cover that little gap.

458
00:48:02,410 --> 00:48:10,570
Okay. If, on the other hand, that doesn't happen, let's say you have a delay, maybe the wounds become contaminated.

459
00:48:11,530 --> 00:48:16,509
You don't want to just close the wound over that area because you want to trap infection or something deeper in the tissue.

460
00:48:16,510 --> 00:48:19,630
So another way to repair wounds is by secondary intention.

461
00:48:20,470 --> 00:48:24,220
And here you have to let all that inflammatory process happen.

462
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:27,220
Had to remove all the damage created granulation bed,

463
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:32,710
and eventually the epithelial cells can migrate over this, but they have a lot longer distance to go.

464
00:48:33,550 --> 00:48:40,330
Okay. So all the same processes are happening here to scab and eventually you can

465
00:48:40,330 --> 00:48:45,700
get the epithelial cells growing and proceeding across the granulation bed.

466
00:48:46,450 --> 00:48:53,049
But if that gap is too far, you might not get recapitalization, or at least not to the extent of before.

467
00:48:53,050 --> 00:48:57,940
And you're going to get a bigger scar. Okay. Yep. So with that secondary.

468
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:01,930
I'm like when people like you don't get a treatment right away,

469
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:08,620
but that is similar like to what it would look like if you were going back into an incision that had already been opened.

470
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:14,230
Like if someone like had like a liver surgery and then you were going into that exact same incision site.

471
00:49:15,490 --> 00:49:23,800
So if you're going into the same site of injury, like usually even with the best of techniques, there's some scarring that takes place.

472
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:30,250
So like in your abdomen, if you've had previous abdominal surgery and you have to go in to have another abdominal surgery.

473
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:35,320
One potential complication is the degree of scarring. So you can have connective tissue adhesions.

474
00:49:35,830 --> 00:49:39,790
So that makes it more complicated because you usually have to cut through some area of scarring.

475
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:48,940
In the situation of secondary intention. So yeah, so this is going to end up with a bigger scar.

476
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:54,490
So there's potentially more functional loss because connective tissue is denser.

477
00:49:54,910 --> 00:50:01,810
So if you have a scar on your arm or anything at some point and notice that there's less elasticity to your skin there because it's tacking it down,

478
00:50:03,190 --> 00:50:08,019
the degree of functional appearance impairment depends on like the extent of that and sort of where it is.

479
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:14,360
Like if you have that happen over joint, that constriction is going to be more impactful than if it's not a joint and in the abdomen.

480
00:50:14,710 --> 00:50:18,850
The degree of functional loss depends again on the degree of scarring.

481
00:50:19,630 --> 00:50:27,010
So yeah, I guess they're kind of similar in the basic principle is the length of damage or the extent of damage that has

482
00:50:27,010 --> 00:50:32,440
to be filled by that connective tissue gap dictates the amount of scarring in the amount of functional loss.

483
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:36,639
But in anything like the liver surgery or whatever you're doing there,

484
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:42,219
the goal is to try and for the surgeon is to try to minimize the degree of gap and like minimize the stuff,

485
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:48,400
the area that's going to be filled by the extracellular matrix that really answers your question.

486
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:52,220
Yes. I mean, yeah. Yeah. And then some.

487
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:56,440
Yeah. Okay. So minimal scar versus bigger scar.

488
00:50:57,100 --> 00:51:04,179
Sometimes this whole process goes awry. So some of you might have heard of Keloids, which is basically scarring.

489
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:08,590
But for some individuals, due to factors that we don't completely understand, you know,

490
00:51:09,010 --> 00:51:15,400
perfectly normal skin get an injury of some sort and then during that granulation tissue and fibrotic phase,

491
00:51:16,390 --> 00:51:20,820
but the fibroblast activation is not properly turned off.

492
00:51:21,430 --> 00:51:29,310
So it kind of goes a little bit crazy and you get excess deposition of collagen, so you get this sort of raised tumor like scar area.

493
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:36,399
So those are keloids that can be kind of the start of a vicious cycle because, you know, these large protuberance masses,

494
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:42,340
sometimes it depending on where it is, it interferes with function and the only real fix for it is to remove it surgically.

495
00:51:42,670 --> 00:51:46,990
But then you've created another injury, which you then have to heal. So this can be quite problematic.

496
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:54,340
It's just an example of an abnormal regenerative response, and there are a number of factors that can be at play.

497
00:51:54,670 --> 00:51:57,970
There's a genetic predisposition to this, but it's not very well understood.

498
00:51:58,420 --> 00:52:02,090
Just an example of. Okay.

499
00:52:02,090 --> 00:52:05,960
So this is the overview again, everything that we've talked about in terms of the process.

500
00:52:06,110 --> 00:52:14,720
So you can see we've kind of completed our discussion of what does the body do in terms of injury, injury, body response, which is inflammation.

501
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:19,550
Transition phase of that, the outcomes which are fibrosis or regeneration.

502
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:26,780
Another important thing is to remember the timeline. So all of this happens in the sequence.

503
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:29,830
The start and end of each sequence has to be kind of well controlled.

504
00:52:32,210 --> 00:52:35,930
Then what to say about this? Oh, so for like general wound is skin.

505
00:52:36,470 --> 00:52:43,490
This is kind of interesting. So if you ever had like a skin wound or something, suture, generally, they take your sutures out like 10 to 14 days.

506
00:52:44,030 --> 00:52:53,030
Right. Usually it actually corresponds to sort of the end of the phase of regulation because she was gone and you were at that phase of scarring.

507
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:59,240
So the tissue is now kind of stronger and you could remove those sutures and the tissue will hold itself together,

508
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:05,380
whereas if you were going to hear the tissue is not strong enough yet to hold itself together, it's likely to open up or to do his.

509
00:53:07,190 --> 00:53:14,840
All right. So that's kind of our whirlwind tour. We've completed our sequence now injury, body response, regeneration.

510
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:22,300
Any questions on that part? Okay.

511
00:53:22,570 --> 00:53:27,400
So let's close the show now.

512
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:33,790
Let's briefly talk exam and we'll take a little break.

513
00:53:33,850 --> 00:53:38,250
Well, look at all these windows. Yeah.

514
00:53:40,090 --> 00:53:44,270
So it makes total sense that, you know, we start off after we have an injury.

515
00:53:44,290 --> 00:53:50,410
But what about things like piercings, where you still have that tiny little hole there that doesn't just play catch up?

516
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:53,710
Actually, piercing relies on the process of scarring.

517
00:53:54,190 --> 00:53:59,710
So, like, have you ever had a failed ear piercing? What's happening there is you're having regeneration of the area of injury.

518
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:03,970
The reason when you get your ears pierced, obviously your skin.

519
00:54:04,210 --> 00:54:07,650
Well, for the most part, can't go through growth, through metal or anything.

520
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:13,389
So the reason you have to leave that earring in there when you first get it pierced is you want so you're blocking,

521
00:54:13,390 --> 00:54:16,030
right, the epithelium from one side, getting through to the other.

522
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:22,630
So what you want to happen is you want a ring like form of scarring, so you're relying on scar and all the edge of that defect.

523
00:54:22,690 --> 00:54:28,060
And then when you take the earring out, it will close the gap because it's just scarred, but you can't jump across that hole.

524
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:32,729
So if you've had a failed piercing, sometimes people are really good.

525
00:54:32,730 --> 00:54:35,080
If kind of connective tissue producers,

526
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:42,520
there are this really that actually produce you get kind of a granuloma because you get connective tissue that forms over the back of the earring,

527
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:46,570
closes that hole in the back, which is gross. And then you have to have that surgically removed.

528
00:54:47,590 --> 00:54:55,510
But yeah, it's actually relying on the process of scarring in order to have that whole body piercing tip that we learned from pathology.

529
00:54:57,670 --> 00:55:01,570
All right. So let's just to before we take our little break, midterm.

530
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:05,500
Okay, so we've completed kind of our little secret.

531
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:10,360
The midterm, I think you already know, covers modules one through six.

532
00:55:11,110 --> 00:55:20,200
Okay. So the appraiser, what you're going to do is just as that is the end of the stuff covered on the midterm next week,

533
00:55:20,410 --> 00:55:24,160
which is the seventh, I do believe the midterm is going to open.

534
00:55:24,730 --> 00:55:29,020
So we will meet here. I'm going to give you kind of instructions for the midterm.

535
00:55:29,020 --> 00:55:34,570
I'll also record that. So for some reason you can't come to the midterm will open that.

536
00:55:35,020 --> 00:55:39,370
That is going to take the form of a downloadable file like a word document.

537
00:55:40,090 --> 00:55:41,809
It's open book, open resource.

538
00:55:41,810 --> 00:55:47,620
So you go, you'll read the questions, you'll go back, you'll look at your lectures, you can look at the quizzes, think about it.

539
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:51,639
Independent work. So like the only thing you can't do, it's not a group effort.

540
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:55,210
You got to answer it yourself. You can't consult another person.

541
00:55:55,900 --> 00:56:00,160
You can talk to me if you're like, I don't understand this question, help me out here.

542
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:03,370
I will give clarifying responses to explain the question.

543
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:09,610
I can't give you the answer and I can't pre grades or exam, so don't like give me your answer.

544
00:56:09,730 --> 00:56:13,990
I guess it's right you'll get there, but I can clarify the questions.

545
00:56:14,350 --> 00:56:22,840
So the book and the next week of class is the 14th and then we start to get it through a like a logistic issue.

546
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:30,520
Because for those of you in step 17, we have lab, you know, the seventh to the 14th, I know Michigan at 30 is on the 14th.

547
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:37,120
So a lot of things start happening at once. So to try to avoid problems, here's what I decided to do.

548
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:40,720
Next week, October 7th, you're going to download that exam, right?

549
00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:47,140
You have all the way up to Monday. I'm not going to make it through the following week, which is the original plan.

550
00:56:47,410 --> 00:56:52,000
But so key is then all kinds of stuff are happening. I feel like that's going to be a problem.

551
00:56:52,750 --> 00:56:56,530
So instead I'm going to extend the deadline to that following Monday.

552
00:56:56,650 --> 00:57:05,200
So that right. 1456 817 is Monday, right at 10 a.m. I don't want it to go too long because like the next Friday,

553
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:07,030
we're going to start talking about the topics and everything.

554
00:57:07,420 --> 00:57:12,640
But the exam is due Monday, October 17th at 10 a.m. and all you're going to do is upload the completed file.

555
00:57:13,510 --> 00:57:21,850
Okay, that access all over that again next week when we talk about it, that gives you ten days, which seems like a huge amount of time.

556
00:57:21,850 --> 00:57:27,190
But you know, depending on how you're structuring the exam.

557
00:57:27,310 --> 00:57:32,650
So in your last review sheet, okay, so this is open book exam.

558
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:37,360
I'm interested of like kind of being able to understand the concepts, consolidate them a little bit.

559
00:57:37,930 --> 00:57:43,360
So there's a lot of questions that are like, explain something, or there might be questions that go a little bit beyond it.

560
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:46,480
Ask you to apply a concept to a particular scenario.

561
00:57:47,290 --> 00:57:51,910
All of the information of the exam directly relates back to things that we covered,

562
00:57:52,060 --> 00:57:55,270
and there are PowerPoints and things that are on the review sheets.

563
00:57:55,930 --> 00:58:03,190
Okay, so the hard part about the exam is because it's not just like recognition, like explain this, tell me something about this.

564
00:58:03,550 --> 00:58:06,100
Sometimes you tend to panic and kind of go off track.

565
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:12,700
Remember that all of the things relate to something we talked about in class, so we'll go over it again next week.

566
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:19,959
But my usual advice for the exam is you download the file and I base is usually to take early in the ten day period.

567
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:23,130
Set aside 2 hours. Words to read through the entire exam.

568
00:58:23,430 --> 00:58:26,850
Right. And jot down like skeletal answers.

569
00:58:26,850 --> 00:58:31,340
Like maybe there's some that's right away. Jot down. Okay. This is related to acute inflammation.

570
00:58:31,350 --> 00:58:37,440
This is related to regeneration, blah, blah, blah. Jot down some notes for yourself so you have a sense of the entire scope of it.

571
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:41,390
So set aside 2 hours. Pretend you're taking the exam in class. Right.

572
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:45,299
Write down everything you have. Then you will know the areas. You're like, Oh, I'm not sure.

573
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:48,990
Here, I have to go back to research those the next day or whenever you have the time.

574
00:58:48,990 --> 00:58:52,200
Go back, fill in more detail, then put it away.

575
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:57,300
And then one last time. Look at it again. Read it over. Turn it in. Okay.

576
00:58:58,110 --> 00:59:04,910
I'll give you ten days. The exam itself might not believe me on this, but the exam itself is designed to take 2 to 3 hours.

577
00:59:04,950 --> 00:59:09,540
It's actually similar to exams that I used to give in class exams.

578
00:59:10,620 --> 00:59:13,890
I want to remove that. Oh, my God. The time's running out.

579
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:22,650
Time, pressure. So, like, karmically, you know, for best performance, people often take, like, four or 5 hours on this exam.

580
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:28,500
I would not suggest even I'm giving you ten days. I would not suggest spending more than 5 hours on this exam,

581
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:34,690
because then you get into the phenomenon of overthinking where you write yourself down an answer, everything's cool.

582
00:59:34,690 --> 00:59:39,480
And then the next day you're like, Oh, no. And you delete it and you write some crazy thing.

583
00:59:41,370 --> 00:59:45,180
So, like, you're not in class exams. You don't have time to do that.

584
00:59:45,210 --> 00:59:50,580
You know, the exam like this, unfortunately, it tends to increase the likelihood that you'll do that.

585
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,730
So like I said, my suggestion is print it out.

586
00:59:54,480 --> 01:00:01,170
Set aside 2 hours of uninterrupted time, pretend you're taking it in class and just do the exam as if you were at an in class exam.

587
01:00:01,590 --> 01:00:05,910
Then you'll be like, Oh gosh, I need to look at this more than you can flesh out your answers at that.

588
01:00:06,090 --> 01:00:10,260
Take a break. That break is important. Flip, read it over once.

589
01:00:10,270 --> 01:00:13,770
Turn it in. Okay. So we'll talk more about that next week.

590
01:00:13,770 --> 01:00:22,010
But the plan is to download it. I'm doing it as a downloadable exam because a lot of this is essentially essay questions, right?

591
01:00:22,380 --> 01:00:27,160
I think it works a little bit better to have it as a downloadable document rather than try to do all those on canvas.

592
01:00:27,180 --> 01:00:31,950
It's hard to see the whole thing on canvas, but then you'll just upload the exam itself.

593
01:00:32,850 --> 01:00:36,030
All right. Any questions about that? Yes. Do we have class?

594
01:00:37,590 --> 01:00:43,020
Next week is October 7th. Yeah. So we'll be holding your class.

595
01:00:43,100 --> 01:00:48,030
Really? Just. Yeah. My intention was to meet here so I could give the exam instructions.

596
01:00:48,090 --> 01:00:52,709
I will record it. So I'll try to be as clear as possible.

597
01:00:52,710 --> 01:00:59,160
So, you know, you don't have to come up. Even if there's nobody here, I'll record myself talking to myself again.

598
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:07,139
So my intent was to kind of meet here so that I can answer any questions related to exam.

599
01:01:07,140 --> 01:01:13,380
I can show you a little bit more. You know, open the exam and show you things I want you just watch out for.

600
01:01:13,410 --> 01:01:17,400
So there will be a short meeting just to say this is the exam.

601
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:22,209
Get any questions, make sure everybody is good to go. And then, I mean, it's not going to take you hours.

602
01:01:22,210 --> 01:01:25,470
It could take, like 15 minutes. Does that make sense? Okay.

603
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:30,270
Then the next week is what, the 14th? The next week it's the 14th.

604
01:01:30,270 --> 01:01:37,500
We are. So the exam will be. Well, I mean, if you're done early, please just turn it in for the grading.

605
01:01:38,010 --> 01:01:43,559
But it won't be due until the 17th. So the 14th, we're going to go on this class.

606
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:46,620
We're going to do liver structure function. Okay.

607
01:01:47,130 --> 01:01:50,220
I know some of you will be at so key that day.

608
01:01:50,730 --> 01:01:54,270
So our structure functions are pretty straightforward.

609
01:01:54,270 --> 01:01:57,600
So I'll record that lecture. So if you missed it for SMP, you should still be good.

610
01:01:57,990 --> 01:02:01,770
You won't do the pathology of the liver lecture until the following week,

611
01:02:01,770 --> 01:02:08,130
and that's the one that it gets a little bit more important to be in class more and more, but it becomes unnecessarily complex.

612
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:11,160
Is that right, to get sort of what we're doing? Okay.

613
01:02:11,940 --> 01:02:16,790
All right. Let's take a little break and get back to it with neoplasia and the differences.

614
01:02:17,310 --> 01:02:24,040
Oh, that's very nice. Yeah.
