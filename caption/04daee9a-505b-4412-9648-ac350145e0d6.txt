1
00:00:03,562 --> 00:00:08,762
Today's session of HMP600 health services

2
00:00:08,762 --> 00:00:16,826
system will be covering the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid expansion.

3
00:00:16,826 --> 00:00:21,450
So as we know, the 2010 Patient Protection and

4
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:25,644
Affordable Care Act expanded Medicaid and yet

5
00:00:25,644 --> 00:00:29,741
there are a number of issues related to that.

6
00:00:29,741 --> 00:00:38,223
So today we'll be reviewing the conditions in the 2000s that affected the ACA.

7
00:00:38,223 --> 00:00:43,788
The enactment of the law itself will review the ACA provision

8
00:00:43,788 --> 00:00:49,473
to expand Medicaid and the Supreme Court decision on the ACA.

9
00:00:49,473 --> 00:00:54,473
And then we'll look a little bit of the impact of

10
00:00:54,473 --> 00:00:58,098
the ACA on the Medicaid program and

11
00:00:58,098 --> 00:01:03,474
compare some state Medicaid programs considering

12
00:01:03,474 --> 00:01:09,114
whether they expanded or not expanded under the ACA.

13
00:01:09,114 --> 00:01:15,339
So just briefly to review the conditions that led up to the Affordable Care Act.

14
00:01:15,339 --> 00:01:20,630
Prior to passage of the Affordable Care Act, the number of non

15
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:27,367
elderly people who were uninsured was increasing throughout the 2000s.

16
00:01:27,367 --> 00:01:32,180
And when we look at the group of people who were

17
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:37,880
uninsured by income, we see that they, of the 40,

18
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:42,188
nearly 48 million who are uninsured,

19
00:01:42,188 --> 00:01:49,427
just over half were below the 139% of the Federal Poverty Line.

20
00:01:49,427 --> 00:01:53,849
And the next group were between 139% and

21
00:01:53,849 --> 00:02:00,433
399% of the Federal Poverty Line or low and moderate income.

22
00:02:00,433 --> 00:02:06,080
And only 10% were above 400% of the Federal Poverty Line.

23
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:10,330
And this led to a number of provisions that we have

24
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:15,099
discussed elsewhere about the Affordable Care Act and

25
00:02:15,099 --> 00:02:18,842
the provision of the Affordable Care Act.

26
00:02:18,842 --> 00:02:22,182
Today, we're gonna look specifically at

27
00:02:22,182 --> 00:02:26,646
the Affordable Care Act provisions to expand Medicaid.

28
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:31,544
And so the law as originally passed, said, eligibility for

29
00:02:31,544 --> 00:02:36,641
Medicaid would be up to 138% of the Federal Poverty Level.

30
00:02:36,641 --> 00:02:44,320
And eliminated the restrictive eligibility requirements specific to certain groups.

31
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:50,187
So by eliminating those specific eligibility requirements,

32
00:02:50,187 --> 00:02:54,061
Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act,

33
00:02:54,061 --> 00:02:59,040
would now be expanded to cover all low income groups,

34
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,262
including single adults without children.

35
00:03:03,262 --> 00:03:09,626
A few other provisions were establishing the Health Insurance Exchanges

36
00:03:09,626 --> 00:03:14,972
to have insurance plans offered for low and moderate income.

37
00:03:14,972 --> 00:03:21,031
And for the federal government to provide subsidies to people in that low and

38
00:03:21,031 --> 00:03:27,482
moderate income group to buy into the insurance plans offered on the exchanges.

39
00:03:27,482 --> 00:03:32,467
So that was the Affordable Care Act as it was initially passed of some

40
00:03:32,467 --> 00:03:35,887
of the provisions in the Affordable Care Act.

41
00:03:35,887 --> 00:03:44,068
And so now, just to think about at the ACA as it was originally passed.

42
00:03:44,068 --> 00:03:50,212
This image shows a graphic representation of the specific low income groups

43
00:03:50,212 --> 00:03:55,300
who were eligible for Medicaid prior to the passage of the ACA.

44
00:03:55,300 --> 00:04:02,654
That is, the groups who are under the red part of the umbrella of Medicaid,

45
00:04:02,654 --> 00:04:06,742
pregnant women, children, elderly and

46
00:04:06,742 --> 00:04:12,839
people with disabilities, some parents of young children.

47
00:04:12,839 --> 00:04:17,636
The blue part of the umbrella in this illustration shows

48
00:04:17,636 --> 00:04:21,617
how the Affordable Care Act expanded Medicaid

49
00:04:21,617 --> 00:04:26,431
eligibility to all low income individuals and groups.

50
00:04:26,431 --> 00:04:32,567
So the restrictions to only specific groups is eliminated for

51
00:04:32,567 --> 00:04:36,815
Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act and

52
00:04:36,815 --> 00:04:41,771
the definition of low income is expanded to be up to

53
00:04:41,771 --> 00:04:45,787
138% of the Federal Poverty Level.

54
00:04:45,787 --> 00:04:52,660
Now, something important to keep in mind when talking about Medicaid eligibility,

55
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:57,529
no matter what the time period, is that what it means is those

56
00:04:57,529 --> 00:05:02,691
groups defined as eligible may be able to qualify for Medicaid.

57
00:05:02,691 --> 00:05:07,306
It does not mean that members of those groups that

58
00:05:07,306 --> 00:05:12,608
are eligible are automatically enrolled in Medicaid.

59
00:05:12,608 --> 00:05:18,068
So to say, a group is eligible does not mean that members

60
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:25,288
of those groups necessarily are enrolled in Medicaid in any given state.

61
00:05:25,288 --> 00:05:29,777
Each state has various income level thresholds for each group,

62
00:05:29,777 --> 00:05:32,944
as well as other eligibility requirements.

63
00:05:32,944 --> 00:05:36,162
That may include asset tests,

64
00:05:36,162 --> 00:05:40,744
it may include application requirements,

65
00:05:40,744 --> 00:05:47,821
related to how frequently you must attest to your income or assets.

66
00:05:47,821 --> 00:05:54,225
The location at which you can apply for those benefits and

67
00:05:54,225 --> 00:06:00,764
other requirements that you might be required to apply for

68
00:06:00,764 --> 00:06:04,648
and become enrolled in Medicaid.

69
00:06:04,648 --> 00:06:09,572
And for example, in the notes to this slide,

70
00:06:09,572 --> 00:06:17,608
you can find a link to the Michigan Medicaid eligibility requirements and

71
00:06:17,608 --> 00:06:21,506
statements for different groups.

72
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:24,784
Okay, so also as we know,

73
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:30,598
the Affordable Care Act was subject to a review

74
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:37,021
by the Supreme Court as to its constitutionality.

75
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:41,910
And though the ACA overall was deemed constitutional,

76
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:47,318
the Supreme Court said that each state had the option to decide

77
00:06:47,318 --> 00:06:52,529
whether to expand Medicaid consistent with the ACA or not.

78
00:06:52,529 --> 00:06:56,515
And so, if a state chose not to expand Medicaid,

79
00:06:56,515 --> 00:07:01,975
they would continue to follow the previous rules about Medicaid.

80
00:07:07,034 --> 00:07:13,317
And as we know that as of this date, 35 states plus Washington DC,

81
00:07:13,317 --> 00:07:19,716
DC have expanded Medicaid consistent with the Affordable Care Act,

82
00:07:19,716 --> 00:07:24,376
whereas 15 states have not expanded Medicaid.

83
00:07:24,376 --> 00:07:30,617
And a few states have now approved the expansion of Medicaid but

84
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:34,868
have not yet implemented that expansion.

85
00:07:34,868 --> 00:07:40,594
So then, what does the Medicaid umbrella look like in the states

86
00:07:40,594 --> 00:07:45,484
that have chosen to not expand Medicaid under the ACA?

87
00:07:45,484 --> 00:07:53,102
In those non-expansion states, it means that the restrictions for

88
00:07:53,102 --> 00:07:59,028
eligibility to specific groups, is still in place.

89
00:07:59,028 --> 00:08:03,912
So childless adults are no longer covered by

90
00:08:03,912 --> 00:08:08,671
the umbrella of Medicaid in those states.

91
00:08:08,671 --> 00:08:13,650
Remember childless adults were never included

92
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:18,137
in Medicaid up to the Affordable Care Act.

93
00:08:18,137 --> 00:08:24,527
In states that expanded Medicaid because of the Affordable Care Act,

94
00:08:24,527 --> 00:08:30,594
those childless adults under the poverty level are now included,

95
00:08:30,594 --> 00:08:37,000
but in non expansion states, they are still specifically excluded.

96
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,624
And in addition, the income eligibility

97
00:08:41,624 --> 00:08:46,248
thresholds can be set at levels lower than

98
00:08:46,248 --> 00:08:51,929
138% of the Federal Poverty Level and indeed,

99
00:08:51,929 --> 00:08:56,700
can be lower than the poverty line itself.

100
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:01,514
Now, recall that part of the ACA statute that was not struck

101
00:09:01,514 --> 00:09:06,230
down by the Supreme Court or was upheld by the Supreme Court

102
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:11,829
are the federal subsidies for low and moderate income individuals.

103
00:09:11,829 --> 00:09:17,649
Those between 138 and 400% of the Federal Poverty Level.

104
00:09:17,649 --> 00:09:24,091
Essentially, all of those individuals in a non-expansion state,

105
00:09:24,091 --> 00:09:28,867
are eligible for subsidies or could be eligible for

106
00:09:28,867 --> 00:09:33,654
subsidies to buy insurance into the marketplace.

107
00:09:33,654 --> 00:09:38,692
And what this means is that in non expansion states,

108
00:09:38,692 --> 00:09:45,675
some of the poorest people are not eligible for Medicaid in that state and

109
00:09:45,675 --> 00:09:50,961
yet are also not eligible for marketplace subsidies.

110
00:09:50,961 --> 00:09:55,808
Because those subsidies coming from the federal government

111
00:09:55,808 --> 00:10:00,853
are only given at above 100% of the Federal Poverty Level.

112
00:10:00,853 --> 00:10:07,566
Today, about 2 million poor adults fall into this coverage gap.

113
00:10:11,503 --> 00:10:15,571
Now, let's take a look at a state,

114
00:10:15,571 --> 00:10:20,598
here is the map of all of the states and the status of

115
00:10:20,598 --> 00:10:25,868
whether they have adopted the Affordable Care Act,

116
00:10:25,868 --> 00:10:31,042
expansion of Medicaid or not adopted at this time.

117
00:10:31,042 --> 00:10:36,641
Including showing a few of the states

118
00:10:36,641 --> 00:10:42,058
that are with the crosshatch here,

119
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:46,932
that have adopted it via a vote of

120
00:10:46,932 --> 00:10:51,628
their state voter decisions,

121
00:10:51,628 --> 00:10:57,239
that have not yet been implemented.

122
00:10:57,239 --> 00:11:02,331
But let's take a look at what's happening in

123
00:11:02,331 --> 00:11:07,155
a state that chose not to expand Medicaid?

124
00:11:07,155 --> 00:11:09,651
And we're gonna take a look at Texas.

125
00:11:09,651 --> 00:11:13,095
And the eligibility standards for

126
00:11:13,095 --> 00:11:18,327
Medicaid in Texas, which is a non expansion state.

127
00:11:18,327 --> 00:11:22,729
And Texas is a great state, lots of great things about it.

128
00:11:22,729 --> 00:11:27,150
I know some of you in this class are from Texas, but

129
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:32,308
it's easy to pick on Texas in this regard because they have

130
00:11:32,308 --> 00:11:37,910
the highest number of people who are uninsured in the country.

131
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:43,027
So, to qualify as eligible for Medicaid, you do so

132
00:11:43,027 --> 00:11:48,739
if you are a child under the age of 18, who is a citizen or

133
00:11:48,739 --> 00:11:53,750
a legal permanent resident of the US and of Texas.

134
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:58,397
And if you are a child living in a single parent

135
00:11:58,397 --> 00:12:04,024
household with under $1,875 a month in income,

136
00:12:04,024 --> 00:12:10,630
which translates into about $22,500 in annual income,

137
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:14,439
you would be eligible for Medicaid.

138
00:12:14,439 --> 00:12:19,300
Similarly, if you lived in a household with a parent and

139
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:23,645
one sibling, those children would be eligible if

140
00:12:23,645 --> 00:12:28,729
the income was up to about 28,000 in annual income.

141
00:12:28,729 --> 00:12:34,901
Now, it's important to note that this level,

142
00:12:34,901 --> 00:12:41,076
22,500 is above the Federal Poverty Line

143
00:12:41,076 --> 00:12:46,632
threshold for a single parent and a child,

144
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:51,124
and that's up to about 138%.

145
00:12:51,124 --> 00:12:54,924
Now, let's look if you are a pregnant woman,

146
00:12:54,924 --> 00:12:58,639
would you be eligible for Medicaid in Texas?

147
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:02,503
If you are pregnant and single and

148
00:13:02,503 --> 00:13:07,196
earning under $2,061 a month, or

149
00:13:07,196 --> 00:13:13,959
about just under $25,000 a year in annual income,

150
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:18,789
that is above the Federal Poverty Line for

151
00:13:18,789 --> 00:13:26,396
an individual which is about $12,500 a year in 2019.

152
00:13:26,396 --> 00:13:32,177
Similarly, a pregnant woman who has one child,

153
00:13:32,177 --> 00:13:37,817
would qualify for Medicaid in the state of Texas

154
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:44,315
if they had an annual income of about $33,492.

155
00:13:44,315 --> 00:13:49,220
So, there we see that being eligible for Medicaid, these groups,

156
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:54,642
children and pregnant women are eligible even when their income goes above

157
00:13:54,642 --> 00:13:59,998
the Federal Poverty Line, just above the Federal Poverty Line in Texas.

158
00:13:59,998 --> 00:14:02,864
But let's think about the adult.

159
00:14:02,864 --> 00:14:08,852
In let's say this household, the single parent adult,

160
00:14:08,852 --> 00:14:12,978
the child would qualify for Medicaid.

161
00:14:12,978 --> 00:14:20,386
But the adult in that household would qualify for

162
00:14:20,386 --> 00:14:24,903
Medicaid if they had an income

163
00:14:24,903 --> 00:14:30,141
under $103 a month, that is,

164
00:14:30,141 --> 00:14:37,203
their annual income was below $1,236.

165
00:14:37,203 --> 00:14:42,267
The adults, parents of poor

166
00:14:42,267 --> 00:14:47,753
children qualify for Medicaid

167
00:14:47,753 --> 00:14:53,239
in Texas if their income is 7%

168
00:14:53,239 --> 00:14:58,523
of the Federal Poverty Line.

169
00:14:58,523 --> 00:15:02,787
If there are two children in the household,

170
00:15:02,787 --> 00:15:07,398
the income threshold goes up to $2,352,

171
00:15:07,398 --> 00:15:11,787
or about 11% of the Federal Poverty Line.

172
00:15:11,787 --> 00:15:19,389
Of course, what this means is that most parents of poor children who qualify for

173
00:15:19,389 --> 00:15:25,976
Medicaid, the adults in the household do not qualify for Medicaid.

174
00:15:25,976 --> 00:15:30,581
And of course, you can see the bullets on this page.

175
00:15:30,581 --> 00:15:37,143
Single adults under the age of 64 without children and

176
00:15:37,143 --> 00:15:43,007
who are not pregnant, by status do not qualify for

177
00:15:43,007 --> 00:15:49,161
eligibility in Medicaid under any circumstances.

178
00:15:49,161 --> 00:15:54,223
Older adults, the elderly who are 65 and older,

179
00:15:54,223 --> 00:16:00,698
who have little to no income and need long term care can qualify for

180
00:16:00,698 --> 00:16:08,723
Medicaid once they have been in a long term care facility for more than 30 days.

181
00:16:08,723 --> 00:16:15,664
And also people who are receiving SSI, Supplemental Security Income,

182
00:16:15,664 --> 00:16:20,103
through Medicare because they are disabled or

183
00:16:20,103 --> 00:16:24,426
blind, they potentially can be eligible for

184
00:16:24,426 --> 00:16:28,313
Medicaid based on some other criteria.

185
00:16:28,313 --> 00:16:33,627
So, in the non expansion state of Texas

186
00:16:33,627 --> 00:16:39,263
we see that fairly restrictive limits and

187
00:16:39,263 --> 00:16:42,645
rules about Medicaid for

188
00:16:42,645 --> 00:16:47,008
many groups are still in place.

189
00:16:47,008 --> 00:16:53,717
Poor pregnant women and poor children do qualify as eligible for

190
00:16:53,717 --> 00:16:59,445
Medicaid at slightly above the Federal Poverty Line.

191
00:17:02,162 --> 00:17:08,002
And just to summarize, today nearly 5 million poor adults,

192
00:17:08,002 --> 00:17:13,394
would be eligible for coverage if all of the non expansion

193
00:17:13,394 --> 00:17:17,798
states follow the ACA and expanded Medicaid.

194
00:17:17,798 --> 00:17:22,216
However, today they remain uninsured.
