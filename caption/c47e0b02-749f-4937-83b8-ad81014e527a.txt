1
00:00:00,202 --> 00:00:08,072
there are two common methods for calculating grades, point accumulation and weighted grading.

2
00:00:08,072 --> 00:00:12,452
We'll start by looking at a point accumulation example.

3
00:00:12,452 --> 00:00:24,722
Using the sample syllabus, I'm going to create each of the assignments listed and give them the indicated point value.

4
00:00:24,722 --> 00:00:30,422
For grading something such as attendance and participation where students aren't submitting work,

5
00:00:30,422 --> 00:00:44,872
but you still need a column to give them a grade at the end of this semester, you'll create an assignment and set it to no submission.

6
00:00:44,872 --> 00:00:57,092
Now that I have my assignment one, I'm going to use the duplicate option to create my assignments two and three since they're worth the same amount.

7
00:00:57,092 --> 00:01:06,072
Once all assignments are created, you can look in the grades area to see all the assignments listed and check their point values.

8
00:01:06,072 --> 00:01:15,222
If you'd like to have your grades held instead of automatically posting for students, you can set a course grade posting policy.

9
00:01:15,222 --> 00:01:21,402
This is a new feature of grade book that you can apply to all the assignments in your course,

10
00:01:21,402 --> 00:01:28,142
click the grade book settings icon and navigate to the grade posting policy tab.

11
00:01:28,142 --> 00:01:32,612
The default is that all grades automatically post to students once they're entered,

12
00:01:32,612 --> 00:01:40,202
switching to manually post grades will hold or mute, as it was called before all assignments.

13
00:01:40,202 --> 00:01:46,262
While you're in the settings, you might also want to look at the late policies and the advanced tab,

14
00:01:46,262 --> 00:01:51,392
which now offers an option to instructors to override a final grade.

15
00:01:51,392 --> 00:02:02,062
Make your selection and click update. Once you've finished grading each assignment, you'll come back and post the grades,

16
00:02:02,062 --> 00:02:12,932
which will allow your students to see their grade for that assignment. You can also post the grades from the speed greater view.

17
00:02:12,932 --> 00:02:14,702
Once you have everything set,

18
00:02:14,702 --> 00:02:32,042
you can use the student view button on the home page to see a sample of how your students will see their grade section of the course.
