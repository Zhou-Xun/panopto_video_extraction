1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,530
Sorry. Do you want to wait? Do you want to wait?

2
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:16,719
Okay. Thanks, Lee. And thank you, Jesse, for the photo op.

3
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,700
And now I appreciate how Hillary feels about guarding her e-mails closely.

4
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:28,460
So in this talk, I want to do a few things.

5
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:36,880
One is to talk about new directions in the area of diarrheal disease epidemiology and also in the sector of water, sanitation and hygiene and wash.

6
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:44,170
And with a focus on a systems approach in this area.

7
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:52,479
But I also want to kind of broaden that idea, because taking this kind of systems approach that we're doing with my research

8
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,969
group is not necessarily definitely not unique to diarrheal disease epidemiology,

9
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:01,990
not unique to infectious diseases. So there's a long history of that.

10
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:07,840
A longer history of that. But also there's increasing interest in chronic disease and social community also.

11
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,250
So there's a broader context here, which I want to address.

12
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:22,600
And so a lot of the what I'll be doing is showing you a lot of examples that have been done largely by past and current students in my lab.

13
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:29,360
So. So we think about diarrheal disease epidemiology.

14
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,700
There's a long, long history of research in this area for four decades,

15
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:40,910
arguably more risk factors, studies in this area than any other area in public health.

16
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:52,540
And the reason for that is that that disease has been the leading cause of infant mortality and mortality globally for quite a while.

17
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:58,239
But because of all this work in in this area, we've made a lot of progress.

18
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:04,300
And one of the big areas in which we've made progress is the introduction or rehydration therapy,

19
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:12,219
the landmark intervention that really reduced our infant mortality rates significantly.

20
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:18,280
That was in the seventies. We've also done quite a good job in increasing coverage of water and sanitation.

21
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:25,240
The Millennium Development Goals have ended in 2015 and had a goal of having everybody,

22
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:31,089
every country's percentage of of households that did not have improved water,

23
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:40,030
sanitation and largely in the water area that was achieved and wasn't quite achieved in the sanitation area, but still quite a bit of progress.

24
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:47,219
But in spite of that progress, we still have lots of issues to deal with.

25
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:52,980
We still have literally billions of individuals exposed to sewage.

26
00:02:53,580 --> 00:03:04,050
And the Rio and the media attention with the Rio Olympics have really highlighted the fact that there's lots of contamination in cities like Rio.

27
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:11,730
Rio is not unique. And really what in a communications that we published recently, we wanted to highlight the fact that.

28
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,700
The media attention to the Olympics about, you know,

29
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:23,990
the exposure of athletes over two or three weeks is just highlighting what people are exposed to daily in these these areas.

30
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:36,500
And one area that I've been working in with Rafael Mesa also is in Mexico City, where for hundreds of years,

31
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:46,129
Mexico City's untreated wastewater has been sent through its canals into a northern valley.

32
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:49,700
The Mexico Valley used for irrigation and.

33
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:55,540
It's not unique in the fact that this is happening worldwide.

34
00:03:55,540 --> 00:04:05,380
It is unique because Mexico City is a huge city. We're talking with over 20 million people standing at 50 cubic centimeters per second of sewage,

35
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:09,190
which most of us probably can't intuit what that means.

36
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:13,690
That's a lot of sewage. And if you go into these communities,

37
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:19,060
you can actually see these canals are going right through these communities and they're using it for agriculture.

38
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:28,580
But there's still a few studies that really are informing us what the important exposure pathways are for this, and we still don't know a lot.

39
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:40,690
In fact, we conducted a baseline study last year in this area and found that the risk looked very similar to what they were 25 years ago.

40
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:50,240
So there are some landmark studies done in the early nineties by Cifuentes and Blumenthal,

41
00:04:50,630 --> 00:05:00,440
and these studies were based on the studies that were the basis for the 2006 guidelines on the use of wastewater for agriculture.

42
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:12,170
As you can see, looking at the relative risks here that our study and the baseline study shows as high or even

43
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:20,270
potentially higher risks associated with exposure to this wastewater than it was 25 years ago,

44
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:23,809
even though the baseline levels it raises have decreased.

45
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:27,050
So we're seeing less diarrheal disease overall,

46
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:34,880
but the relative risks associated with contamination of the wastewater remains and

47
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:41,180
the levels of Athens that we're seeing remain high as they were 25 years ago.

48
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:53,480
This is a plot that kind of tells us what kind of coverage and progress people have made or countries have made throughout the years.

49
00:05:55,010 --> 00:06:04,430
So the percent coverage is on the X axis. Y axis is the rate in which countries are adopting improved water or piped water.

50
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,319
And so the idea is that if you're making adequate progress, you're on this line.

51
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:14,330
That is when you start with low coverage, you don't expect that your rate of increase is going to be high.

52
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:22,190
Likewise, when you're at the end close to 100%, you're going to start slowing down your rate of increase.

53
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:27,560
And so the countries that are below this are the ones that are not making progress as

54
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:34,100
not making the progress that we would expect that we based on the millennium goals.

55
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:39,290
And so the and the countries above are the ones that are making better progress, are made better progress.

56
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:46,460
So basically, even though overall, we say that the Millennium Development Goals were met.

57
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:49,190
We see that there's a lot of heterogeneity,

58
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:55,040
a lot of countries that are not making the progress that that were set up by the Millennium Development Goals.

59
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:03,800
So that's an issue that we need to deal with. And so now we have 2015, the beginning of the Sustainable Development Goals.

60
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:09,920
So the goal in 2030 is now inspiring universal coverage.

61
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:18,120
And so now that we want to have universal coverage, we need to start addressing these heterogeneity, these inequities and more.

62
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:23,480
I'll be talking more later about compliance becomes a real central issue doesn't just the fact that

63
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:31,430
you have these technologies and infrastructure you need to be using it and they need to be working.

64
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:34,040
And so that becomes a central issue.

65
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:45,350
And this study actually highlighted the class of study where there was a huge roll out of sanitation in India, over 10,000 households involved.

66
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:54,590
Claussen it all showed evaluated this this intervention showed there is no health benefits, no measurable health benefits at the end of this rollout.

67
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:59,180
A lot of it had to do with low uptake and also low compliance.

68
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:09,260
So we need to be thinking a lot more about compliance and the fact that these technologies that are being rolled out have to be actually used.

69
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:18,250
And this kind of highlights another aspect, another intervention, which is water treatment.

70
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:30,250
So, you know, BHO set up some guidelines in 2010 giving guidance to what level of treatment water filters should have.

71
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:35,070
And so these are in light of the use of these log removal units.

72
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:44,710
So the log reduction, so basically they're recommending using it and they did this through a risk a risk assessment that to be highly protective,

73
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:53,110
you want to have for log removal of bacteria. You want your device to remove five log of viruses and four protozoa.

74
00:08:53,950 --> 00:09:00,280
And the way is, again, a protective label if you have to 3 to 4 below that interim.

75
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:06,970
So the issue here is that they're assuming complete compliance in perfect compliance with this.

76
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:14,480
And so. We did some modeling to look at what that really actually meant.

77
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:19,569
So this solid line here is, is assuming that complete compliance,

78
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:29,380
which is basically saying every log reduction increase you have based on your device able to filter out more pathogens,

79
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:32,890
you'll get a basically a log removal improvement in disease burden.

80
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:37,780
And so that's assuming perfect compliance.

81
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:46,629
But as you can see from these other lines, you get this diminishing returns that occurs if you don't have perfect compliance and

82
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:50,709
it doesn't take that much off that perfect compliance to get this diminishing returns.

83
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:56,290
It's basically saying that once you act in this these simulations, once you're at about three log removal,

84
00:09:56,530 --> 00:10:01,300
you're not going to get much health benefit by going to a device that removes for log or five log.

85
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:05,440
And that has to do with the fact that it's. More important.

86
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:12,979
To have compliance at this point at the level of three life removal than it is that actually people

87
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:17,270
are using the device than it is that you have a device that actually removes more pathogens.

88
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:19,670
And that becomes important. And I'll talk about this a little later.

89
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:28,400
When you're dealing with things like filters that as the filter is improved and it removes more and more pathogens.

90
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,780
The flow rate decreases, the usability basically decreases.

91
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:39,600
And so the usability is decreasing is not necessarily a better thing to be at advocating for these removal.

92
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:46,150
Devices. So that's another one big issue.

93
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:56,000
Another big issue now moving into thinking about some of the other nuanced issues that have come up.

94
00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:05,960
This is a review that we did a little while ago about on the research, the four decades of research that has been conducted in this area.

95
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:12,709
And so we see there's a long history of risk factor studies, followed by a long history of interventions.

96
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:18,890
And those interventions have had a lot of mixed results. I actually showed you one study that's a recent one.

97
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:22,040
So a lot of it has to do with issues about compliance and uptake.

98
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:30,980
A lot of it also has to do with this other fact that we focus on and the fact that people think of these interventions treating the water,

99
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:36,380
treating sanitation, improving hygiene as independent processes.

100
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,160
And so somebody that is interested in water treatment.

101
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:50,129
Pushes these water treatment interventions without thinking about sanitation and hygiene, as opposed to people that are interested in sanitation.

102
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:56,760
Devices are moving and trying to improve uptake of sanitation, not thinking about these other pathways.

103
00:11:57,330 --> 00:12:02,530
And so. Largely if you do a thorough review of the literature.

104
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:14,080
Most of the work is assuming this independence, but you see these glimpses of studies that actually are actually actually did look at and

105
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:19,330
think about these interdependencies and actually showed empirically in both a cohort study,

106
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:24,940
a few cross-sectional studies and then a met analysis of RC TS that the level of

107
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:30,190
sanitation hygiene is going to modify how effective your water intervention is.

108
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:33,700
And so there's a there's a fair amount, actually, of literature,

109
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:40,809
even though it's a minority of the huge breadth of literature that's suggesting this interaction.

110
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:50,690
And then if you look at a model. I also model and explore the mechanisms behind this interdependency.

111
00:12:51,050 --> 00:13:00,740
Here is basically a village where you've got within household transmission occurring presumably

112
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:06,380
due to hygiene questions you have between household transmission occurring a pathogens.

113
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:14,000
You got contamination of the water likely due to poor sanitation.

114
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:17,720
Then you got exposed. People are exposed to drinking water.

115
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:29,010
And so we can think about. And we can simulate an intervention where we're intervening in this drinking water pathway.

116
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:37,500
And look at what the impact is of that drinking water intervention in the context of different levels of hygiene and sanitation.

117
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,290
And so that's what we did in the simulation.

118
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:50,880
And basically what we're seeing here is that so the colors here are showing blue means that the intervention was not effective red.

119
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:59,910
The intervention was effective. And we see on the Y axis is community level transmission, X-axis household level transmission.

120
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:03,570
So basically, if household level, intermediate level transmission is high,

121
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:09,210
you're not going to get a lot of health benefits in treating the water, even if there is contamination in the water.

122
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:16,660
Only when you start getting less, if you start improving, let's say,

123
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:24,970
the hygiene within a household and this community level transmission, do you start seeing that this intervention be effective?

124
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:35,820
So. We're basically trying now to promote this idea of this interdependency in.

125
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:49,219
Thinking about how we. How we choose to intervene and how we think about these as as a suite of interventions as opposed

126
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:54,050
to these independent activities that you might want to that that different people pursue.

127
00:14:56,540 --> 00:15:02,270
So to do that requires developing a framework.

128
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:09,860
And so this framework is one in which we want to explicitly acknowledge the environmental.

129
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:13,050
Transmission of these pathogens.

130
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:21,700
So if we think about that, standard transmission models that people tend to use for these pathogens and for directly transmitted pathogens,

131
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:26,260
there are what we call these seir models. So susceptible, infected, removed.

132
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,050
We keep track of the number of susceptible, infected, removed,

133
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:35,890
and we assume that a transmission occurs when an infected person contacts susceptible person.

134
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:41,749
So but we know from a lot of these pathogens that that's not what happens.

135
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:46,040
So people shed into the environment and then people are clean and have contact with the environment.

136
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:52,009
So understanding the environment becomes important becomes important because for

137
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:54,790
a number of reasons it's because that's where we're going to be intervening.

138
00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:01,070
We're going to be treating the water, we're going to be improving sanitation, we're going to be improving sandwiches, hygiene.

139
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:04,160
So these are all these are all environmental interventions.

140
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:12,140
So we want to explicitly account for that in our model also because by collecting environmental data,

141
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:17,480
it can enhance our ability to understand what's happening as opposed to just relying on human data.

142
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:21,560
So there's a two reasons for looking at that. So here is.

143
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:27,220
Our basic framework. So we have our standard, what we call our model.

144
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:32,740
Keep track of number SUSCEPTIBLES the number of infected. The number of removed which are immune.

145
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:44,240
So people that are exposed to the environment, viral pathogens will, well, at a certain rate move from susceptible to becoming infectious.

146
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:49,850
If one is infectious, you'll be shedding pathogens at a rate alpha into the environment,

147
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:53,900
and then there's a certain di afraid of pathogens in the environment.

148
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,790
So if we keep characterize.

149
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:07,200
Our model now with the environment explicitly in our reproductive number calculation, which is a measure of of epidemic potential.

150
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:13,830
Is now becomes a function of these environmental properties.

151
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:20,880
So this parallels a lot with the way in which people have study malaria and vector borne disease work.

152
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:28,620
So people in malaria would be in analogous situation where we're keeping track of the mosquitoes and then are

153
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:34,580
not are reproductive potential is a function of a lot of entomological parameters like mosquito biting rate,

154
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:40,350
mosquito longevity. And that concept is what's used when people are trying to think about interventions,

155
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:48,180
they go out and measure the mosquito biting rate, their longevity in the mosquito, and these various environmental parameters.

156
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,530
We can be doing the same with waterborne pathogens.

157
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:57,560
And so. Here's our not calculation.

158
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:02,060
And if we think about it, here's the different pieces of data. We're going to be interested in all this shedding rate.

159
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:11,360
So the rate in which people are shedding pathogens into the environment, certainly a highly variable parameter.

160
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:18,549
Parameter that's not. Real easy to measure, but it is measurable and there are data out there.

161
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:25,660
And again, these are the kind of experiments that we'd want to be promoting to understand this level of contamination into the environment.

162
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:32,200
RO there isn't actually pick up rate or the ingestion of pathogens.

163
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:36,670
This would be if it's a waterborne or foodborne pathogen, ingestion of pathogen from the environment.

164
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:48,729
That rate of ingestion is going to be an important piece of information if it's a waterborne or drinking water example, ingestion of,

165
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:54,820
you know, the rate, how much people drink, how much water people drink per day might be a way to estimate that parameter.

166
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:06,709
This pie is a infectivity parameter or and we can think about it more specifically as a dose response parameter.

167
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:13,280
That is the what is the probability of becoming infected as a function of the dose of the pathogens in environment?

168
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:18,319
Again, we're thinking about pathogens in the environment now because we are explicitly modeling that and

169
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:24,590
there's a huge literature microbial risk assessment on characterizing dose response functions,

170
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:30,680
and we've done a fair amount of work thinking about that, those functions in the context of a transmission system.

171
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:39,790
And in the last year's persistence, the persistence of the pathogen in the water is going to be another major important

172
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:45,850
factor in the epidemic potential of the given infectious disease system.

173
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:58,080
And so, again, a fair amount of data in the literature on persistence in different water sources,

174
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:01,590
different temperatures, and we've done some work on there.

175
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:10,109
There's also the transport piece, which is not actually explicitly here and in this simplified model because they're not explicitly modeling it,

176
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:15,150
but the fact that these cavities can move and be transported in the water is going to be another important factor.

177
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:19,050
So by by explicitly putting this in the model,

178
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:27,179
we can now think about these environmental parameters as and how they relate to epidemic potential and how we can

179
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:34,200
think about interventions that might change some of these parameters in order to reduce the epidemic potential.

180
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:40,660
So. Another big.

181
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:49,219
Issue that comes up when we start thinking about this environmental transmission is this question of what we call herd protection,

182
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,780
which is analogous to herd immunity.

183
00:20:51,620 --> 00:21:02,659
So when we implement vaccines and have vaccination strategies, our goal is not necessarily to vaccinate everybody,

184
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:10,520
but actually to hit that critical threshold that where we can get herd immunity, thereby protecting the unprotected.

185
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:18,260
And so that concept, again, developed and directly related to an ACR epidemic model.

186
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:22,959
Has an allergies to all of the other interventions.

187
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:30,280
So this idea of herd protection says that if we're to what extent does the

188
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:38,980
community benefit from a high coverage of sanitation in latrines in a community,

189
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:42,610
even if everyone doesn't have a latrine in their household?

190
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:48,080
And same with water. And. Sanitation.

191
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:55,100
So this is basically a schematic of a model similar to the the model that I showed before household level model.

192
00:21:55,100 --> 00:22:05,000
But now we explicitly think about hygiene interventions that can block both the contamination of household environments by infected individuals,

193
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:16,030
but also block people getting exposed. A drinking water intervention will then block any and any combination coming through.

194
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:24,880
Drinking water, sanitation intervention will be block the spread of pathogens into a community environment.

195
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:36,760
So with this kind of framework, we can think about this herd protection concept and both think about the idea of direct and indirect effects.

196
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:43,470
So again, with the vaccine analogy, if you get a vaccine, you are you have direct protection.

197
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:50,440
That is, you are now protected from. Being exposed to a given pathogen.

198
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:56,380
But if enough people are vaccinated in this room, then even the people that are not vaccinated get this indirect effect.

199
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:01,580
And so what we want to look at is this direct and indirect effect.

200
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:11,170
If we think about water and hygiene interventions that are out there that are actually fairly similar in this respect.

201
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:15,100
Here we see the coverage in a community increasing.

202
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:23,140
And here's the proportion infected. So if we look at any given coverage level, the difference is the direct effect.

203
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:27,190
That is the difference between the control group and the intervention group.

204
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:29,470
Give us a measure of the direct effect.

205
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:39,460
So we see we have a direct, direct effect occurring the group and pretty similar level and all coverage percentages.

206
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:44,050
But as the coverage increases, this slope is a measure of that indirect effect.

207
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:53,890
So if we look at the to the two solid lines here, the black line shows that the direct effect is, you know, substantial and it's pretty constant.

208
00:23:54,550 --> 00:24:02,950
But an indirect effect increases and becomes significant once we get a certain beyond a certain coverage level.

209
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:13,690
So indirect effects become significant at higher coverage levels and can actually provide provides this added benefit and to an intervention.

210
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:22,330
In contrast, if you have a sanitation intervention. The immediate, the direct effects are actually pretty minimal.

211
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:26,000
If you think about it, you're sanitation.

212
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:35,320
Improving sanitation is really trying to prevent contaminating the environment which everyone is opposed, which is exposed to.

213
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:41,270
So it's really this community intervention. And so so our indirect our direct effects are pretty low.

214
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:48,050
Our indirect effects are pretty low and low coverage and increase only in high coverage.

215
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:56,780
So we can actually appreciate that closing result of the sanitation rollout in India because they had such low uptake.

216
00:24:56,780 --> 00:25:00,560
Because they have such low compliance. Yeah.

217
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:05,540
They, you know, it's understandable why they're they couldn't even actually measure any health benefits.

218
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:09,020
And it really is a lesson that again.

219
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:14,970
You don't want to just stop with having this great technology that you think can remove pathogens,

220
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:20,160
but you want to ensure that you actually can get uptake in the life before you actually.

221
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:27,899
Expanding the amount of resources it took huge amount of resources to unroll this sanitation intervention.

222
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:37,320
That didn't happen. That had no effect. And so, again, this indirect effect and having coverage is going to be critical for a sanitation intervention.

223
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:48,260
So. We wanted to look at our Ecuador study site to see whether or not we could measure very quick action.

224
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:57,799
And so we. Took some of the data that we had collected between 22,013.

225
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:05,360
We had it and we use spending as our outcome measure and had two exposures.

226
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:09,290
One is household level sanitation.

227
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,210
So that's really measuring that direct effect.

228
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:19,550
Whether or not whether or not the fact that you have improved sanitation, sanitation in your household will improve.

229
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:26,030
Your health conditions. And then we have this neighborhood effect,

230
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:33,230
which is a proportion of improved latrines or sanitary facilities within a 500 meter radius of your household.

231
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:43,480
So. The baselines that we had just sort of base baseline data.

232
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:49,800
18% of the children that were in the study had moderate to stunting.

233
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,809
We saw that improved sanitation at the household level of 75%.

234
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:58,290
And here it gives us the coverage gradation not.

235
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:08,540
Only 5% had less than 40% coverage and then 33% had 40 to 75% and then on to increasing percentage of coverage.

236
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:13,660
So that was our data. Baseline data or descriptive data.

237
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:24,720
And so we can see from these results that the indirect effect or this community effect was quite significant.

238
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:34,390
So a 0 to 1 odds ratio when we compare 0 to 100% that's associated with your neighbors having.

239
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:44,440
Sanitary and crew sanitation as opposed to a 0.7 that's insignificant associated with household level.

240
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:50,780
And so one of the important messages from these data was the fact that actually,

241
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:56,000
if you don't think about indirect effects, you're actually going to underestimate what your coverage is.

242
00:27:56,030 --> 00:28:03,530
So our total effect is actually because people are experiencing both direct and indirect effect is actually the productivity, which is .15.

243
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:10,550
If we're if our study design was only there was only designed to measure the direct effects,

244
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:18,080
we'd be underestimating what actually the impact of this sanitary improve sanitation is.

245
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:24,160
Did that happen in the India analysis?

246
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:27,530
Did that, what the Indians said.

247
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:37,790
The problem with the Indian analysis is that and I'm going to see if I can remember the actual data, but we're talking about 10 to 20% uptake.

248
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:44,380
And even though it was like 30% compliance. So you're so far down this mountain range.

249
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:49,750
We didn't have that. So you in that curve I showed you're way down at the bottom again.

250
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:50,870
So there was just no hope.

251
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:59,360
And again, there is there is there is an editorial, again, I really think talking about the ethics of actually doing an intervention like that.

252
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:03,620
When you have such a low, I'm taking clients.

253
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:08,749
So yeah, in fact, in our study, if you notice, there are we have the opposite problem.

254
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:15,379
We didn't have a lot of information at the low coverage level, so we were not able to get at another interesting question,

255
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:19,100
which is whether that is a threshold effect or whether or not it's continuous.

256
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:22,640
And so that's one of the questions we're trying to figure out right now.

257
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:27,170
But we need actually better data on the full coverage.

258
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:39,190
So another area that we've been focusing on, important environmental factors, climate.

259
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:46,180
And so so I'm going to start with some analysis of data from our recorder site, again,

260
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:53,560
where we had four years of active surveillance data on self-report, diarrheal disease across 21 villages.

261
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:58,899
We had four years of climate data. We had and we had climate stations in four of these villages.

262
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:07,660
And we used creating technique to interpolate the climate temperature and rainfall in the other villages.

263
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:16,170
And so. This just shows you the weekly, this aggregated weekly.

264
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:24,870
Self-report diarrhea across the 21 villages. And then this is our rainfall data.

265
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:34,590
So our exposure in this analysis was extreme rainfall and that is the 90th percentile of over that four year period.

266
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:41,399
And then we had this contextual variable, which we're going to look at for interaction, and that is eight week total rainfall.

267
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:48,719
So the idea is you can get an extreme rainfall event during the dry season or you can get extreme rainfall event during the wet season.

268
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:55,400
And what are the differences? And they're pretty dramatic differences.

269
00:30:55,410 --> 00:31:05,360
So if you see that during the dry season, you actually have extreme rain event is a risk during the wet season.

270
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:13,460
Extreme rainfall is protected. So the idea here is that this follows what people have been calling the dilution concentration theory,

271
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:17,150
that when you have a lot of during a rainy season, you got a lot of water.

272
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:24,970
An extreme rain event is actually flushing pathogens out of your community, whereas in the dry season,

273
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:32,480
extreme rain event is actually is actually bringing out a lot of the concentration and concentrating a lot of pathogens and contain those pathogens,

274
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:36,640
increasing the risk. She doesn't know.

275
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:42,060
It's just the skin of the brain is still high risk.

276
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:49,290
Because you have, you know, so in this is the very beginning of the rainy season, you know,

277
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:56,580
like it's not like if you had it low and you start the rainy season, you were essentially in that below average rainfall.

278
00:31:56,730 --> 00:32:02,400
So that right at the beginning of the rainy season, you get a lot of high risk as it progresses.

279
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:11,399
Right. But any. Even in a rainforest area where we're at, when there's a lot of rain, there's just there's a lot of heterogeneity and rainfall.

280
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:16,070
So you could have periods of dry. Yeah. Even in that quote unquote rainy season.

281
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,470
So that's why we're kind of we would look at it in this way.

282
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:24,260
We get so used to seeing, you know, at the start, like being a place like India where you had months.

283
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:32,080
Yes. That would be your high risk. Time, but when you have these extreme rainfall events right at the beginning.

284
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:44,630
And so we looked at how percent drain treating their water might modify this.

285
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:52,760
And so basically this we saw that under the low in this low total rainfall scenario.

286
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:58,090
What. Drinking, you know, treating your drinking water can counteract that risk.

287
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:04,360
And in high training, your drinking water actually is what gives you that benefit.

288
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:15,219
So suggesting that which makes sense that. These extreme rainfall events are are being mediated through the drinking water.

289
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:18,220
And that is the risk is coming from people drinking water.

290
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:22,960
And therefore, you can mitigate that risk through feeding water associated with.

291
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:29,680
Rainfall events. So.

292
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:39,850
We want to and this is some current work we wanted to take and think about this mechanism one step further.

293
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:46,390
We want to think about it in the context of rotavirus for a couple of reasons.

294
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:51,640
One is that is where we are. We have data in our study, say, on rotavirus.

295
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:57,099
But the other is that rotavirus is thought to not be environmentally mediated.

296
00:33:57,100 --> 00:34:00,309
People tend to think that are that are working on rotavirus.

297
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:06,790
That rotavirus is because it's infectious as person to person spread and they're thinking about water and sanitation is not important.

298
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:11,930
But. Rotavirus survives in the water.

299
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:17,970
It's fairly fairly persistent in the water. Some data in the next slide and also.

300
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:27,210
In a lot of time series analysis where we're looking where people look at temperature related to rotavirus disease burden,

301
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:33,120
there's there's significant association between temperature and rotavirus that

302
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:37,230
would suggest that that environment must play some role in transmission.

303
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:48,200
And so. Basically what this model is is looking at two communities, both with the same model construct that I introduced earlier,

304
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:55,810
set to both infectious and immune individuals and then the environment and then people set into the environment.

305
00:34:55,820 --> 00:35:00,950
This is the local environment for Community one and people are exposed to the environment.

306
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:06,590
Same with this downstream community. And what we've added here is the transport that we can.

307
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:14,839
Basically these pathogens can be transported from the upstream community to a

308
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:19,850
downstream community with a certain amount of die off occurring over time.

309
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:25,720
But also importantly to address this question of this.

310
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:31,600
Empiric result that temperature is impacts incidence.

311
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:36,490
We want to really look at this persistence parameter as a function of temperature.

312
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:43,760
So. And in that way, we can look at this question of.

313
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:54,880
You know, what is the role of person to person transmission? Direct transmission versus a person to environment to person transmission.

314
00:35:56,940 --> 00:36:00,060
And so these are data collected from.

315
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:09,130
A variety of studies that measured measured die off of rotavirus in the in the water as a function of temperature.

316
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:18,640
Lots of variability here, but we can see that the rotavirus is fairly persistent at, you know, less than 20 degrees.

317
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:24,820
And here we're at a point, one that's like the average persistence of 100 days.

318
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:36,249
But then once you get above 20 degrees, we start seeing the die off increasing some of these points here about, you know, one day persistence.

319
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:41,460
So we can see quite a bit of range from 100 days to one day as a function of temperature.

320
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:47,930
So temperature is certainly important with respect to persistence of rotavirus in the environment.

321
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:53,620
And so one question we have is can water act as a disseminator?

322
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:58,419
So yes, rotavirus has is infectious and will go.

323
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:01,270
And certainly person version transmission is going to be important.

324
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:09,910
But can water actually be the mechanism which is which introduces a strain of rotavirus into a community?

325
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:17,970
The answer is yes. Under these conditions, flow rates have to be greater than diaphragms.

326
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:21,600
So basically the patient has to make it from one community to another.

327
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:32,360
But also, we need to be in the conditions either of low dilution so that no pathogens make it from upstream the downstream community,

328
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:35,880
or we need high person to person transmission.

329
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:42,280
And this is kind of summarizes yes or no saying yes, it acts as a disseminator.

330
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:46,840
No, it doesn't. But basically saying under these low condition, low dilution conditions,

331
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:54,400
regardless of what the person to person transmission rate is, we see rotavirus can act as the disseminator.

332
00:37:55,720 --> 00:38:03,190
But if rotavirus transmission, person to person transmission is high, it can act as a disseminator, even if there's more dilution.

333
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:08,140
That is, if if person to person transmission is high enough.

334
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:17,260
Introducing one pathogen in the community might be enough to to to cause an outbreak and move that infection through a community.

335
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:21,820
So I think one thing that's been ignored in the literature,

336
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:30,189
especially the way in which risk factor studies are done, is this fact that rotavirus can be active, disseminated.

337
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:34,479
That is, you won't be able to catch this piece if you're just looking at one community

338
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:39,100
and doing a risk factor analysis on the importance of water and sanitation.

339
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:48,250
So, Joe, but don't in your river village don't the people use the streams to go to the rivers to go downstream?

340
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:49,110
Yes. Right.

341
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:58,270
So you have the person first and we have move it so that they do it right, which I think which you're which I'm going to address in the next slide.

342
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:03,350
So movement is the other way in which pathogens can go from community.

343
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:06,940
Community. Human movement. And so that's the other thing to look at.

344
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:14,230
So this is quickly looks at and this is it.

345
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:22,690
This simulations are meant to compare the empiric data that time series analysis on the relationship between temperature and incidence.

346
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:27,990
So we see here that as temperature increases like we we think cumulative incidence decreases.

347
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:34,640
That is as temperature increases, more of the pathogens are dying off. And that's a function of actually the risk.

348
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:42,130
The slope is going to be a function of the epidemic potential that they are not from direct person to person transmission.

349
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:46,060
And so these are actually the risks cases per 100 per degree.

350
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:58,900
If we look at a meta analysis that one of my students earlier conducted on rotavirus studies, she estimated ten cases per 100 per degree.

351
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:06,040
So and. There's likely to be a fair amount of confounding in this estimate.

352
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:12,040
Rainfall, for instance, and temperature are highly correlated.

353
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:20,950
So we expect that this is biased upwards. So it compares favorably to some of these estimates that we had in this in our risk model.

354
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:26,830
So, again, a way in which we can explain how temperature can affect.

355
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:34,140
A mechanism we can play on how temperature might affect the incidents patterns that we're seeing in rotavirus.

356
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:47,140
So movement which. Is another way in which packages can basically go from one community together.

357
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:51,180
And as Karl mentioned, that people are moving up and down these rivers.

358
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:55,780
This is actually a different years of maps of our study site in Ecuador.

359
00:40:56,650 --> 00:41:02,260
These are the dark, the black lines, the roads, the blue lines, the rivers.

360
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:07,930
So you can see a lot of communities are don't have access to the roads and their communities do have access to the roads.

361
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:11,530
And so we wanted to look at this movement.

362
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:20,780
In our study. And so we collected a lot of movement data, a lot of movement data, questions like do people?

363
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:27,490
Or you ask people, how often have you left or have you left?

364
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:34,430
I'm sorry, the village in the last week. And then we look at the percentage of people who say yes and we can get an estimate of travel.

365
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:42,010
It turns out that twice as many people that are in along the road villages travel than compared to people in remote villages that make sense.

366
00:41:42,310 --> 00:41:50,800
We also see, you know, adults travel more. Turns out kids traveling under five traveled more than kids between five and 13.

367
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:53,470
We think that's because a lot of those are traveling with the adults.

368
00:41:56,770 --> 00:42:04,059
And so this shows you differences over our study period 2003, 2012, we see this increase in travel,

369
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:09,790
but the remote villages are still traveling less than the less remote villages.

370
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:17,620
Interestingly, by 2013, the remote villages look like they're traveling about as much as the less remote villages were in 2003.

371
00:42:19,690 --> 00:42:28,240
So we can now look at a different model where we think about moving instead of moving the people instead of moving up pathogens in the water.

372
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:32,320
And we can look at our now we're just looking at these our models.

373
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:37,510
So we model people in the village that aren't traveling, people in the village that are traveling to the city.

374
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:44,770
And we model the city. And if we look at that, we can actually quantify once we calibrate the model to the data,

375
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:50,740
how much increase in risk this this community will have due to this travel,

376
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:56,680
and that is reintroduction of pathogens into the community that people are traveling out to.

377
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:59,830
Adults introduce infections from the city because they're the ones traveling more.

378
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:05,320
But more importantly, you know, 20% of the children are up to 10% of adults are infected locally.

379
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:07,780
That's the indirect effects, the increased risk.

380
00:43:08,050 --> 00:43:14,500
And this occurs even if this local community has a very low transmission potential of our now less than one.

381
00:43:16,990 --> 00:43:22,540
So movement becomes. Important.

382
00:43:22,930 --> 00:43:26,919
And now? See, I only have a few minutes. I will kind of move.

383
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:36,130
So we basically looked at movement more empirically with our four years of surveillance data and seeing.

384
00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:37,600
So to what we,

385
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:45,520
what we were looking at here was looking at to the degree in which neighboring communities could affect the risk of a of any given community,

386
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:57,370
which was true. But more interestingly, what we did, again, we looked at how drinking water would modify the risk if the regional risk of rotavirus.

387
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:03,820
What I'm sorry, of of diarrheal disease is low than drinking water actually was effective,

388
00:44:04,210 --> 00:44:07,360
suggesting that local transmission was mediated through water.

389
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:11,080
But if regional risk is actually high,

390
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:19,330
we don't see that effect of drinking water on the risk suggesting that regional spread is mediated by human movement and not by water.

391
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:25,480
That gives us indirect evidence about the importance of human movement based on these data.

392
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:32,879
So I think I will just skip the last part because we're running out of time.

393
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:35,940
But just just to talk about that.

394
00:44:37,990 --> 00:44:45,910
There's a lot of direction and future direction in this area associated with environmental processes, associated with social processes.

395
00:44:46,270 --> 00:44:54,220
A lot on climate and vulnerabilities. I talked about where we're now looking at the questions of vulnerability associated with these climate risks.

396
00:44:55,720 --> 00:45:04,450
Measuring and measuring pathogens is an area that we need to spend a lot more time on and in how we connect those those pathogen data,

397
00:45:04,450 --> 00:45:10,860
that pathogen data to human data, human health data. And then compliance, which I did, is the one part that I didn't get to talk about.

398
00:45:10,870 --> 00:45:16,780
It's going to be incredibly important with respect to making sure that these interventions are successful,

399
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:22,960
as well as leveraging social science and social network work that we've also been doing.

400
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:29,469
And lastly, thinking about this infectious causes of chronic disease, we got to stop thinking just about viral disease,

401
00:45:29,470 --> 00:45:37,540
but also about the chronic implications of repeated inter pathogen infection causing cognitive problems and and stenting and such.

402
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:46,090
And that's really, again, another direction that we're heading to and most people are having to do in this area with that.

403
00:45:54,570 --> 00:46:05,600
20. All right. We have one question for you at the top of the hour on Monday.

404
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:10,790
Have a. That's correct.

405
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:19,160
All right, assuming you're coming, right.
