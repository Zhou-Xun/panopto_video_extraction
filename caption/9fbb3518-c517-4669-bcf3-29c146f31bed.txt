1
00:00:00,764 --> 00:00:05,965
This recording is about dominance.

2
00:00:05,965 --> 00:00:10,807
Dominance is a concept we can use and what it says here is that regardless

3
00:00:10,807 --> 00:00:15,730
of any whatever you're willing to pay for quality adjusted life years,

4
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:20,434
we can at least say something about preferences for interventions.

5
00:00:20,434 --> 00:00:25,740
And there are two types of dominance, strict dominance and extended dominance.

6
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,795
Just as a reminder here is what our cost effectiveness plane looks like.

7
00:00:29,795 --> 00:00:32,446
This one is typically used, I guess in Europe, and

8
00:00:32,446 --> 00:00:36,084
this is when we've been using in class here, where we have the quality

9
00:00:36,084 --> 00:00:41,540
adjusted life years on the horizontal axis and costs on the vertical axis.

10
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:43,647
And remember in the lower right hand corner here,

11
00:00:43,647 --> 00:00:45,361
we're saving money improving health.

12
00:00:45,361 --> 00:00:48,191
We like those interventions compared to A and

13
00:00:48,191 --> 00:00:52,745
in the upper left hand corner that makes health worse and it costs money.

14
00:00:52,745 --> 00:00:56,205
So we don't like interventions in that quadrant compared to A.

15
00:00:56,205 --> 00:01:00,467
If you flip the axes around, so you have qualities on the vertical axis and

16
00:01:00,467 --> 00:01:02,280
costs on the horizontal axis.

17
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,690
Those regions switches, so here, now the upper left hand corner is saving money,

18
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:08,140
improving health.

19
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:11,530
The lower right hand corner costs money and it worsens health.

20
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:13,679
So keep in mind when you're looking at these things,

21
00:01:13,679 --> 00:01:15,268
just remember what the axes look like.

22
00:01:15,268 --> 00:01:19,640
We're gonna go back to that European, [COUGH] example here.

23
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:24,450
So here we have incremental benefit on the horizontal axis, the qualities,

24
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:28,740
incremental costs on the or the costs on the vertical axis.

25
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:32,540
And we have three interventions here right now, A, B, and C.

26
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:36,465
And here, if we look at intervention, B this blue region,

27
00:01:36,465 --> 00:01:39,230
is what we call the region dominated by B.

28
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:43,984
If there's any other intervention that lies in that light blue area,

29
00:01:43,984 --> 00:01:47,530
that means that that intervention is higher cost and

30
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:51,430
worse qualities, so we say that that's dominated by B.

31
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:54,474
And no matter what you're willing to pay for equality,

32
00:01:54,474 --> 00:01:57,518
you would not prefer any interventions in that region,

33
00:01:57,518 --> 00:02:00,646
you would always prefer B to whatever's in that region.

34
00:02:00,646 --> 00:02:06,198
So we say that region is dominated by B.

35
00:02:06,198 --> 00:02:10,221
Here we see, we've got a region dominated by A,

36
00:02:10,221 --> 00:02:15,740
that area has higher costs and worst qualities than A.

37
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:19,662
And then here we have intervention C, right now, to start off with intervention,

38
00:02:19,662 --> 00:02:20,630
C is not dominated.

39
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:25,135
But, [COUGH] if it were in this region here,

40
00:02:25,135 --> 00:02:29,642
it's not technically both higher cost and

41
00:02:29,642 --> 00:02:33,411
lower qualities than either A or B.

42
00:02:33,411 --> 00:02:35,491
It's not in this region, right now,

43
00:02:35,491 --> 00:02:38,940
the blue regions are what we call strict dominance.

44
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,432
And but right now,

45
00:02:40,432 --> 00:02:46,230
intervention C is in a region will call dominated by extended dominance.

46
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:49,856
So, if we kind of draw a line between A and

47
00:02:49,856 --> 00:02:54,787
B, this is on what I'll call the bad side of that line.

48
00:02:54,787 --> 00:02:58,400
And so we'll say this is dominated by extended dominance.

49
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,353
So if you have interventions and you draw kind of that line between them,

50
00:03:03,353 --> 00:03:07,005
anything on what we call the bad side, higher costs,

51
00:03:07,005 --> 00:03:11,340
lower qualities is would be dominated by extended dominance.

52
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,888
So what is this extent?

53
00:03:12,888 --> 00:03:18,337
And by the way, so intervention C is right here, but if interventions C had slightly

54
00:03:18,337 --> 00:03:23,866
higher costs, or sorry, slightly lower costs or slightly better health outcomes,

55
00:03:23,866 --> 00:03:29,640
now it's no longer dominated if it's on the other side of that line.

56
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,444
So and then so

57
00:03:30,444 --> 00:03:35,281
now here we have interventions that would be dominated by C if it was out there.

58
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:39,240
And now we would draw lines between A, C, and B.

59
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:43,534
And anything in the light blue regions here now would be dominated by extended

60
00:03:43,534 --> 00:03:44,280
dominance.

61
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,908
And in the I guess the darker light blue would be sort of lighter

62
00:03:48,908 --> 00:03:52,840
light blue would be dominated by strict dominance.

63
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:58,442
So, strict dominance, it has higher costs, lower quality than some intervention.

64
00:03:58,442 --> 00:04:03,989
And extended dominance has higher costs and lower quality than, and

65
00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:11,040
then something on the line between two of the other interventions.

66
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,191
So what is this crazy idea about extended dominance?

67
00:04:13,191 --> 00:04:14,791
Why do we even think about that?

68
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:19,504
Well, economists will say, well, theoretically, a policymaker maybe could

69
00:04:19,504 --> 00:04:23,317
give a fraction of the population each of those interventions and

70
00:04:23,317 --> 00:04:27,501
achieve a point along that line, some sort of looming accommodation.

71
00:04:27,501 --> 00:04:31,058
So let's say the policymaker flips a coin and if its head,

72
00:04:31,058 --> 00:04:36,240
the someone in the population gets intervention A if it's tails, they get B.

73
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,210
And so over the entire population they could get a mix and

74
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:44,410
that mix might be on this line here.

75
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:49,307
And so C now is dominated by this new intervention of half A day and

76
00:04:49,307 --> 00:04:51,780
half the population getting B.

77
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:54,367
Where you have cost somewhere in the middle and

78
00:04:54,367 --> 00:04:57,563
the quality is somewhere in the middle, between A and B.

79
00:04:57,563 --> 00:05:01,968
That's kind of a theoretical idea is that policymakers could

80
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:05,864
generate any policy anywhere on this line between A and

81
00:05:05,864 --> 00:05:09,530
B by randomizing people in the population to that.

82
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:14,025
And so anything to the upper left of this dark blue line then would be

83
00:05:14,025 --> 00:05:15,728
considered dominated.

84
00:05:15,728 --> 00:05:16,733
And so, well, so

85
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:20,910
that's what someone might say that that is still considered dominated.

86
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:26,176
Another way to think about this extended dominance is if you're willing to spend

87
00:05:26,176 --> 00:05:31,363
a high amount of dollars per quality to get a dominated point, why wouldn't you

88
00:05:31,363 --> 00:05:36,338
spend a little bit more to at a lower cost per quality to get a better outcome?

89
00:05:36,338 --> 00:05:43,540
And so let's look at this example here, A, B, and C.

90
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:47,881
Let's say you were considering going between A and C.

91
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:53,466
And you said, wow, I think I'd like to get intervention C instead of A,

92
00:05:53,466 --> 00:05:58,228
you would go along this line and you'd be paying a high cost for

93
00:05:58,228 --> 00:06:00,540
quality to get C instead of A.

94
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:05,398
But then the question is, well, if you're at intervention C, why not spend a little

95
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:09,801
bit more money and get to intervention B, it's even a kind of a better value.

96
00:06:09,801 --> 00:06:13,348
The slope of that line is lower here, so it's a lower cost for

97
00:06:13,348 --> 00:06:14,821
quality to go from C to B.

98
00:06:14,821 --> 00:06:18,601
So the idea is that maybe you would never stop and

99
00:06:18,601 --> 00:06:24,178
just sit at intervention C if you're willing to spend that high amount

100
00:06:24,178 --> 00:06:29,375
of cost per quality to get to C compared to A, then maybe you should

101
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:38,173
be willing to spend additional money at a better value to get to B instead of C.

102
00:06:38,173 --> 00:06:43,149
So just to recap strict dominance, an intervention has lower qualities and

103
00:06:43,149 --> 00:06:46,640
higher costs than another intervention.

104
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:51,444
Extended dominance requires three or more interventions.

105
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:54,560
And if something is dominated by extended dominance,

106
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,000
that intervention has lower qualities and

107
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:04,840
higher costs than some sort of linear combination of the other interventions.

108
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:09,134
So that's what dominance is, if something has higher costs and lower qualities,

109
00:07:09,134 --> 00:07:11,180
it's dominated by strict dominance.

110
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:16,008
If it is on the bad side, higher cost, lower quality of a line between two

111
00:07:16,008 --> 00:07:21,180
other interventions, it's considered dominated by extended dominance.

112
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:25,440
So why are we even going through all this goofy exercise?

113
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:30,291
Well, when we're looking at our results, we wanna list our costs and qualities for

114
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:31,741
all the interventions.

115
00:07:31,741 --> 00:07:35,468
We wanna plot all those interventions are cost effective this plane.

116
00:07:35,468 --> 00:07:39,641
But we're only really interested in a new dominated interventions.

117
00:07:39,641 --> 00:07:42,225
So we only wanna list the cost effectiveness ratios for

118
00:07:42,225 --> 00:07:44,240
the undominated interventions.

119
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,743
So here's a simple example.

120
00:07:46,743 --> 00:07:51,359
We might have three interventions A, B, and C.

121
00:07:51,359 --> 00:07:56,327
Here, intervention C is dominated by strict dominance from intervention B,

122
00:07:56,327 --> 00:08:01,540
intervention B has higher qualities, lower costs, intervention C.

123
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:06,080
And so we plot all three of these on our cost effectiveness plane.

124
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:12,385
We draw the line between A and B, because those are undominated alternatives,

125
00:08:12,385 --> 00:08:17,290
there's nothing with lower costs and higher quality than A.

126
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:19,940
Both lower costs and higher quality than A.

127
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:22,179
And there's nothing with both better quality and

128
00:08:22,179 --> 00:08:23,731
lower costs than intervention B.

129
00:08:23,731 --> 00:08:26,240
So, these are undocumented.

130
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,158
So, we're gonna list our interventions were going first list the lowest cost one

131
00:08:30,158 --> 00:08:32,940
intervention A, what's the cost of qualities?

132
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:37,562
And there's no incremental cost effectiveness ratio associated with

133
00:08:37,562 --> 00:08:39,647
the lowest cost intervention.

134
00:08:39,647 --> 00:08:42,401
An intervention B here, we list that and

135
00:08:42,401 --> 00:08:45,886
then here we do list the cost effectiveness ratio.

136
00:08:45,886 --> 00:08:50,362
And we're gonna list the cost effectiveness ratio compared to the next

137
00:08:50,362 --> 00:08:54,092
best alternative, next best undocumented alternative,

138
00:08:54,092 --> 00:08:58,658
which in this case is intervention A, then we have intervention C here.

139
00:08:58,658 --> 00:09:02,240
We're gonna show the cost and quality for intervention C in our results table.

140
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,840
But we're not gonna list a cost effectiveness ratio because the cost of

141
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,370
administration really isn't meaningful here.

142
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:13,035
Because again, you wouldn't be choosing intervention C since it has

143
00:09:13,035 --> 00:09:17,240
higher costs and lower qualities than intervention B.

144
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:22,288
So, this is the the reason we're going through this exercise

145
00:09:22,288 --> 00:09:28,402
of looking at dominance here is to make sure that we are focusing our time and

146
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:32,791
effort on the interventions that are not dominated.

147
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:39,319
And and using that to again, focus on those undocumented interventions and

148
00:09:39,319 --> 00:09:45,729
focus on the cost effectiveness ratios of those interventions, thanks.
