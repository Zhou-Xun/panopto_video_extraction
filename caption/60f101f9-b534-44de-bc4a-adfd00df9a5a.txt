1
00:00:09,513 --> 00:00:13,234
So today we're going to talk about sex and drugs.

2
00:00:13,234 --> 00:00:18,771
In particular how to use reflective listening to handle patients

3
00:00:18,771 --> 00:00:24,922
who are struggling with unsafe sexual practices and substance misuse.

4
00:00:24,922 --> 00:00:26,734
Start with sex?

5
00:00:26,734 --> 00:00:38,247
Take a look at this case.

6
00:00:38,247 --> 00:00:39,800
Let's read into this a little bit.

7
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,142
Let's read between the lines.

8
00:00:41,142 --> 00:00:46,238
What is this man telling you about his sexual activity with other men?

9
00:00:46,238 --> 00:00:47,742
He's clearly ambivalent.

10
00:00:47,742 --> 00:00:53,223
He kind of wants to be healthier and want to be safer,

11
00:00:53,223 --> 00:01:00,639
but he's sort of lacking assertiveness or confidence to do so.

12
00:01:00,639 --> 00:01:02,440
So here's some possible reflections.

13
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:06,063
You feel you're too easily persuaded to not use a condom and

14
00:01:06,063 --> 00:01:09,922
maybe even a little disappointed in yourself because of that.

15
00:01:09,922 --> 00:01:14,333
You feel maybe should be more assertive about safe sex or safer sex.

16
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:19,483
You're starting to think you're sexual practices are a bit risky, but

17
00:01:19,483 --> 00:01:26,000
you're scared if you stand up for yourself, the guy might walk out on you.

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,846
Pick another case here.

19
00:01:33,846 --> 00:01:37,932
Not a lot to go on here, but let's see what we can do with this one.

20
00:01:37,932 --> 00:01:40,640
So for you, pleasure is paramount.

21
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,608
Now, you're willing to take extra risk to make sure you have maximum pleasure.

22
00:01:45,608 --> 00:01:50,720
And you're aware that not using a condom does add some risk to the encounter.

23
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,358
But condoms, they just ruin it for you.

24
00:01:53,358 --> 00:01:56,774
Don't worry that by reflecting something like that,

25
00:01:56,774 --> 00:01:59,305
that you're encouraging the thought.

26
00:01:59,305 --> 00:02:03,351
That's a really common concern when people learning motivational interviewing.

27
00:02:03,351 --> 00:02:05,728
That by reflecting it, you're endorsing it.

28
00:02:05,728 --> 00:02:09,492
No, you're simply showing the person, I get what you're thinking.

29
00:02:09,492 --> 00:02:17,840
I understand your story.

30
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:24,505
What would you say?

31
00:02:24,505 --> 00:02:26,910
Well, you're aware you should be using protection ideally.

32
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:30,026
But it's hard when things get all worked up,

33
00:02:30,026 --> 00:02:33,475
when there's passion and horning us in the room.

34
00:02:33,475 --> 00:02:37,114
You're starting to worry a little bit though, about your impulsiveness.

35
00:02:37,114 --> 00:02:38,401
That's a change stock reflection.

36
00:02:38,401 --> 00:02:44,641
And notice the same tentative language starting to worry about.

37
00:02:44,641 --> 00:02:54,833
Let's take a look at another case.

38
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:57,250
So what would you do with this case?

39
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:02,784
This young woman is basically saying, I don't have a drinking problem,

40
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:07,977
but your intuition is she just might, how would we handle this case?

41
00:03:07,977 --> 00:03:11,313
So, here's a couple of creative reflections.

42
00:03:11,313 --> 00:03:14,601
You know what problem drinking looks like and

43
00:03:14,601 --> 00:03:18,159
currently you're not seeing that in yourself.

44
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:23,188
But or however, if you started to see some of your dad's behavior in

45
00:03:23,188 --> 00:03:28,587
your own drinking, then it seems like you might start to worry about it.

46
00:03:28,587 --> 00:03:31,166
Remember that tentative language, you might start to.

47
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:33,804
We're going to be using that for the rest of the class.

48
00:03:33,804 --> 00:03:46,951
That tentative sort of understated language.

49
00:03:46,951 --> 00:03:48,727
So what would you do here?

50
00:03:48,727 --> 00:03:50,659
Not a lot of change talk to go off.

51
00:03:50,659 --> 00:03:56,144
But let's see if we can sort of flesh them out with some creative reflections.

52
00:03:56,144 --> 00:03:59,110
You have your drinking under control.

53
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:01,755
But it does seem to take some effort.

54
00:04:01,755 --> 00:04:04,373
You're trying to be smart about your drinking.

55
00:04:04,373 --> 00:04:07,280
That's just a straight affirmation.

56
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,412
If you started to drink every day,

57
00:04:09,412 --> 00:04:12,653
it sounds like you might be a bit worried about that.

58
00:04:12,653 --> 00:04:17,943
Notice a tentative language might be a bit worried.

59
00:04:17,943 --> 00:04:21,544
We wouldn't want to say something like if you started to drink every day,

60
00:04:21,544 --> 00:04:23,532
that would prove you're an alcoholic.

61
00:04:23,532 --> 00:04:24,101
Too harsh.

62
00:04:24,101 --> 00:04:29,254
That would probably create reactions the person might run out of the room.

63
00:04:29,254 --> 00:04:33,173
Now we're moving into behavioral health, mental health treatment.

64
00:04:33,173 --> 00:04:38,078
So that's what these

65
00:04:38,078 --> 00:04:42,482
cases are about.

66
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:46,859
So what did you come up with?

67
00:04:46,859 --> 00:04:51,769
Well, let's acknowledge that there's some interest in doing something about it.

68
00:04:51,769 --> 00:04:55,085
You realize you might benefit from getting help therapy or medication,

69
00:04:55,085 --> 00:04:56,833
but it's a double sided reflection.

70
00:04:56,833 --> 00:05:02,040
But on the other hand, you're scared that people will find out and maybe judge you.

71
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,395
You've been feeling sad lately, but

72
00:05:04,395 --> 00:05:08,008
you're not sure you're quite ready to enter treatment.

73
00:05:08,008 --> 00:05:13,047
Both of these have that double sided nature.

74
00:05:13,047 --> 00:05:22,220
Take a look at another case.

75
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,159
Same thing again.

76
00:05:23,159 --> 00:05:26,468
You want to do something about your depression or your anxiety or

77
00:05:26,468 --> 00:05:28,563
your OCD, but you want it to be private.

78
00:05:28,563 --> 00:05:31,559
You don't want to hear other people's opinions about it.

79
00:05:31,559 --> 00:05:41,672
You don't want other people knowing your business, ambivalence.

80
00:05:41,672 --> 00:05:45,461
Now here, we're going to use a skill we talked about many weeks ago called

81
00:05:45,461 --> 00:05:46,693
crossing off the list.

82
00:05:46,693 --> 00:05:50,642
So let's take a look at how we might want to reflect this case.

83
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:55,704
You want to do something about your depression, but you're against medication.

84
00:05:55,704 --> 00:05:57,554
So if you're going to do something about your depression.

85
00:05:57,554 --> 00:06:01,433
It sounds like it's more likely to be a behavioral treatment because you're

86
00:06:01,433 --> 00:06:02,577
against medication.

87
00:06:02,577 --> 00:06:05,224
So we're not going to talk about medication today.

88
00:06:05,224 --> 00:06:07,658
Cross it off the list.

89
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:10,373
So today we've talked a little bit about sex,

90
00:06:10,373 --> 00:06:13,860
a little bit about drugs and a little bit about depression.

91
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:18,304
And in each case we've shown you how you can use reflective listening skills

92
00:06:18,304 --> 00:06:20,258
to help understand the patient.

93
00:06:20,258 --> 00:06:25,118
And subtly start to direct them towards change.
