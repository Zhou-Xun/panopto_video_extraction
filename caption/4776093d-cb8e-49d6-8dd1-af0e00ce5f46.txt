1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:08,570
They saw kids during the pandemic and it was like, oh, maybe three, three times a day.

2
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:10,290
So it was like so new.

3
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:18,750
I think we're just going to see so many of those like stair step and things that just open, like, in ways we can't even think about.

4
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:23,520
Yeah. Yeah. You know? Yeah. Yeah.

5
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:31,460
Oh, how. How? There was.

6
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:49,810
That would be.

7
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:15,190
For the last three years it has been.

8
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:27,409
Everybody welcome. I hope everyone had a good Halloween and football games have officials participate in those.

9
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:37,570
And I had the experience where my youngest kid is now not like doing the trick or treat thing anymore, which is sort of the end of an era.

10
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:43,480
But it was also kind of nice because we didn't end up with like a humongous bowl of candy at my house.

11
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:50,180
I was like, Wow, that actually is a little refreshing after like lots of years of having that leftover.

12
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:55,659
So and I will say I have often pawned it off on this class.

13
00:01:55,660 --> 00:02:01,820
So not today, but so welcome to November.

14
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:15,169
We are I know that in a week's time we'll be experiencing elections.

15
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:23,330
And so, you know, sometimes that can be inordinately stressful.

16
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:32,180
And I hear you that it is stressful, as you know, as some I know that also sometimes people have to,

17
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:37,430
you know, have plans for get out the vote or their activities.

18
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:43,700
And so if that is, you just like let me know if you need to miss.

19
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:50,360
But next week at this time we'll talk about like peer and school based intervention stuff.

20
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:57,050
So if that's that may be relevant, just reading, starting to read through your guys papers that will be relevant to some of these.

21
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:00,260
So that may be a good session to sort of think through your papers.

22
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:12,260
So today we're going to kind of move from early childhood to talking about older kids and you know as as also is like clear that guys papers

23
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:20,150
you know there's not like a hard cutoff right for a lot of these issues that we think about in terms of child health from early childhood to,

24
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,270
you know, what is the next phase of childhood?

25
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:31,760
But a lot of the topics we'll kind of tackle in this session, I think it'll be kind of clear how they map from,

26
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:35,960
you know, early, early development like infancy all the way through adolescence.

27
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:41,990
And so I've been pleased to see kind of people's like developmental rationale coming out in their papers.

28
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:51,170
So thank you for that careful thinking. And I think that this, you know, middle child's her early adolescence.

29
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:57,379
And I'll say again here that just because I'm trying to like pack in so many topics in

30
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:03,770
this class or I feel like I'm trying to pack in a ton of topics as like a kind of a,

31
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,950
you know, overview of relevant child issues.

32
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:14,750
I tend to stop before adolescence and really getting into adolescence, but I wanted that's why I get that new puberty reading, though,

33
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:20,510
to say like if adolescence is like people's area of like passion and expertise,

34
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:24,440
like go for it and talk about adolescence and bring it in and write about it in your papers.

35
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:29,569
Because I'm kind of like my comfort zone, as you guys can tell, is like early childhood.

36
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:35,420
And so there's always like so much more that comes with adolescence.

37
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:39,200
And some people love that and some people are like, Oh gosh, keep away.

38
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:45,890
And so I just want to say again, like wherever people's kind of interest areas,

39
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:51,389
why in terms of age, a lot to be explored in this section I guess I would say.

40
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:58,160
And we'll talk about that sort of wide range of what we consider, you know, quote unquote, adolescence or youth or emerging adulthood.

41
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:04,879
So the big kind of question is how do we get from these guys who are already a little bit older than early childhood,

42
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:11,090
but that sort of school age kids to sort of these these adolescents?

43
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:20,270
And how do we smoothly make all of those many transitions and sort of set adolescents up for future positive health, you know, trajectories?

44
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:31,040
So we'll go through some of those little readings are like these debates around how do we make decisions on behalf of kids,

45
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:39,559
like what information should we consider when we're thinking about child safety and certainly parenting around these these different ages?

46
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:44,540
And and as kids change like that, how we transition is one change I was thinking about.

47
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:50,329
This is like, oh, we're no longer in that getting candy phase or the handing out of candy bars.

48
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:56,000
So that comes with different things. And like I said, I'm working my way through your papers.

49
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:01,010
So how do we kind of get from there to there?

50
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:05,600
And what are the implications for how we're thinking about interventions in particular,

51
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:10,700
what is going to work for these guys and then what is going to work for these guys?

52
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:15,680
And I would argue, and I think a lot of us who've certainly worked with youth before is like it's not going to be the same.

53
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:23,610
And you have to sort of switch up your approach as your kids and focus population are are shifting.

54
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:34,349
One awesome thing I think about kind of moving into this age range, this broad age range question is that, you know,

55
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:41,040
kind of unlike that early childhood phase, we talked about the early childhood classroom context as this great opportunity for intervention.

56
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:50,579
Oh, I was going to say also, I know the poster session was last weekend and at the time I was speaking with like actually Early Head Start teachers,

57
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:58,380
which was really kind of wonderful but also really intense because of all the COVID crisis they were expressing.

58
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:05,339
So it felt like really poignant to kind of be talking about early childhood policy and child care access in this

59
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:09,999
class and then go on Friday and have that sort of intense conversation with all that early Head Start teachers.

60
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,670
So I would say, like, if people are interested in making a big difference,

61
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:19,320
like work with Head Start and Early Head Start because they really need our help anyway.

62
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,500
So when we're thinking about older kids, though,

63
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:29,099
what's great is that they are getting into this stage of like exploring their world more broadly, right?

64
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:39,720
So that Jean gone, I know it's kind of an or I'm sorry, Jackie tackles two different major figures in developmental psychology.

65
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:47,489
This paper is just sort of ticking through a lot of the developmental stages and things that happen across this big age transition.

66
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:53,129
But I like this because it's just sort of illustrating like, okay, we're leaving the house, we're like exploring into school.

67
00:07:53,130 --> 00:08:00,150
We've got all these new opportunities and this is like a lovely example of like peacefully walking to school, right?

68
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:04,590
Not all kids get that right. So a lot of kids are on a bus ride for an hour.

69
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:08,070
A lot of kids are in a neighborhood where it's not safe to walk, etc.

70
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,930
And so that's something to sort of consider with that photo as well.

71
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:21,540
What is also really important to remember is that all of these different activities and potential, you know,

72
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:32,070
new things that kids are doing all represent, you know, opportunities for intervention and exposure to to to basically new things for different kids.

73
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:36,089
And also that different kids will respond differently to each of these things.

74
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:40,710
Right. So some kids might love sports. Some kids might love music, some kids might love reading.

75
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:48,240
And if kids aren't in this early school phase exposed to those things, it's hard to know what they might love.

76
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:55,060
I think we also know that, unfortunately, music and art are often being, you know,

77
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:03,060
decreased in schools in favor of trying to, you know, buffer literacy and math, which is something we'll talk about.

78
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:12,479
But it's really, I think, tragic because those are not only sort of protective factors that kids can really excel at,

79
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,380
maybe if they're not excelling at art or at reading and math,

80
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:23,940
but also just lifelong kind of opportunities to develop these skills in different areas and really have something that,

81
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:28,020
you know, you're good at or you really enjoy. And you may not be good at it, but you may feel enjoy it.

82
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:36,240
And it's a really lost opportunity because, you know, as we are exposed to these different things early,

83
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:43,260
we can kind of, you know, stand a better chance of learning them for, you know, and lasting ways.

84
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:50,100
And that goes for like language and art and music, reading, sports, lots of different domains of development.

85
00:09:52,710 --> 00:10:01,800
And I would just say, you know, when we're when we're thinking of kind of programmatic things to do in schools with kids,

86
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:10,560
these are areas that really need help because they're really not like promoted in schools and they're really getting underfunded.

87
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,070
So certainly, you know, the why is a good example of lots of sports programing,

88
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:24,750
lots around sort of music and arts education can be important sort of venues for intervention around lots of different health outcomes.

89
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:31,049
Of course, we also have, again, like those this idea of exploring out into the world.

90
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:34,440
We also have new contexts for sort of social interactions.

91
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:41,669
And thinking about this with COVID in particular, again, this is much more scary, right, for kids who haven't,

92
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:48,210
especially like a five year old who's been at home for two years and that this is the first year they're actually going to a school place.

93
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:53,549
It's remember with attachment and the strange situation we talked about like one of the

94
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:59,400
lists of like a mild stressor for those kindergartners going to school for the first time.

95
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,190
It's not a mild stressor is probably a massive stressor.

96
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:10,139
And so really thinking about what are these kids like that we're receiving now in these schooling contexts, I would argue,

97
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:14,880
and again, like based on the conversations we were having Friday with the Head Start teachers like they're.

98
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:20,980
Qualitatively different from kids that we've known in the past, even five years.

99
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:27,610
And that's really just, again, like with many things COVID, like, we don't know how it's going to play out.

100
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:34,820
But I think keeping all of those things in mind, you know, from the sort of teacher side we're asking, you know,

101
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,989
I'm sure all of us can appreciate we're asking teachers to do so much more because

102
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:41,950
we're sort of panicked about kids are falling behind in reading and math.

103
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:48,399
But like, yes. And there's all these other things that we know are really important that they're not going

104
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:53,650
to get the opportunity to be exposed to because of our panic about reading and math and,

105
00:11:54,190 --> 00:12:05,020
you know, figuring out how to keep those because those are really restorative and, you know, build teamwork and social skills.

106
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:11,330
And if those aren't in place, then I would argue, like reading and math are probably not going to follow for these kids.

107
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:21,819
So it's sort of a time of strategizing and prioritizing, I guess, but really being very explicit to say these are social,

108
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:27,370
emotional arts, music, other activities are hopefully important for development in this time period.

109
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:31,660
The other thing, when you guys see these pictures of like playground and bus,

110
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:42,190
anything come to mind around like socialization, what kids might experience, might experience in those settings.

111
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:53,269
And if anybody had bus riding experience. And yeah, I just think about like, you're going to sit next to your friends and like just that dynamic.

112
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:59,329
I remember being kind of like sometimes when like your friend is sitting with someone else, like, what does that mean?

113
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:06,700
Same thing with like playing with people on a playground. It was always about, you know, like figuring out like, who can I trust, who that I know.

114
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:14,600
Just, like, very close friendships. Yeah. Yeah. It's like the level of, like, micro decisions and, like, social judgment and worry about that.

115
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:25,700
Yeah. Yeah. Mixing with other age groups, like sometimes like do you do like not younger kids but know, like, I know these are your friends like.

116
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:33,669
Yes, absolutely. Right. Which can be great, can be intimidating, can be like if we think about like problem behavior, right?

117
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:40,209
Like starting, you know, just exposing younger kids and a mixed age group to like problem behaviors that we think about for older kids.

118
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:45,040
That can be a little challenging for sure. Yeah. Yeah. Other thoughts?

119
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:50,900
Yeah. And it feels like a little bit more independent. Like you should all have teachers on, like, every into the playground.

120
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:58,180
So you're not you're kind of doing more like independent like conflict resolution and like just between your peers.

121
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:07,640
Mhm. Very much so. Yeah. So like in contrast to sort of like here's a little crossing guard, these are organized activities right here.

122
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:11,229
Right. So that's very, you know, teacher mediated.

123
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:17,680
You have a coach or a teacher or someone who's like responsible choir director or somebody like that that's maybe an independent,

124
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,040
but it looks like they're in sort of an intense like a library kind of setting.

125
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:23,440
But out here it's a little more loose.

126
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:36,370
And so that whole, you know, who how do you how do people manage, you know, social situations that can be ambiguous differently, can really come out?

127
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:43,840
And I think, again, with COVID, thinking about kids who haven't had those experiences and those nuances that,

128
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,979
you know, come with, what does this kid think of me?

129
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:51,420
Can I approach this kid? What is their facial expression? Tell me.

130
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:56,440
Like I've had two years of not meeting facial expressions in people that I don't know.

131
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:03,340
Like, how does that impact the types of social interaction that, you know, and conflict resolution, like you said?

132
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:12,010
Because, of course, there's like one place structure and there's like more preferred parts of the play structure people might want to go to.

133
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:21,190
So thinking about, you know, of course, bullying is something that we talk a lot about in this, you know, school age.

134
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:26,980
We don't talk about it as much in early childhood, but there's certainly sort of bullying precursors in early childhood.

135
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:37,689
We talk about relational aggression, but certainly these are contexts and because of that lack of teacher presence or sort of teacher presence,

136
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:42,730
but like it's kind of a break for teachers or, you know, classroom or playground monitors.

137
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:50,680
That can be a time when we see like risk for a bullying behaviors that in-person bullying behaviors we know a lot of,

138
00:15:50,680 --> 00:16:01,089
of course, is taken up, you know, taking place online. Another thing to say just on that note, thinking about COVID is that, of course,

139
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:06,700
for some kids, like not being in school was great because of the bullying piece.

140
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:11,139
Right? The online bullying didn't stop necessarily,

141
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:20,230
but the sort of in-person stressors around bullying and anxiety did stop with coping with not attending school during COVID.

142
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:27,940
So that's just sort of something to also point out. And here's the online piece.

143
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,449
So again, that is a huge context.

144
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:34,840
We'll talk about more. But it's certainly you know,

145
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:42,550
it was already different in the last probably ten years compared to when a lot of our sort of knowledge of child development,

146
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:43,300
you know,

147
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:51,400
our knowledge of child development needs to be responsive to the context of certainly mobile phones we've talked about a little bit with infancy.

148
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:58,420
And again, this is a big issue, of course, in the school years, but the online bullying piece occurs there.

149
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:02,950
And what I just present these like pictures of like a one on one friendship,

150
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:10,810
because what we know about bullying and about just sort of school anxiety in general is it really takes just one friend.

151
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:14,680
Like that's the most protective factor for thinking about peers, right?

152
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:22,450
You just need one friend that can help really buffer a lot of these social stressors,

153
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:28,270
thing that happen in in childhood and so in, you know, school age.

154
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:33,220
And so one of the things to think about to back to these sort of different activities

155
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:38,349
is that you might make that one friend in that through a shared activity experience.

156
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:39,969
Right. Which sounds really obvious.

157
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:50,830
But it's another way to think about like the importance of these kinds of external or extracurricular activities because, you know, kids differ.

158
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:54,729
We know kids learn differently. We know kids have different preferences of how they want to spend their time.

159
00:17:54,730 --> 00:18:01,750
And so to make that one friend, you really do want to put kids in lots of different settings and different activity

160
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:05,740
settings that they can sort of figure out what their shared interests are.

161
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:16,270
Okay. Other other thoughts or reflections are on that sort of general school context.

162
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:20,229
I mean, there's so much there's like few adults. I think there's one adult here, right?

163
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:25,780
So it is really like an entirely different world and again in this COVID era.

164
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,720
Very different from what a lot of kids have experienced.

165
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:35,829
So I was just stating, oh, the other thing about we'll talk more about bullying I think next week,

166
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:44,620
but for interventions, thinking about this kind of like kid dominated zones that don't have many adults in them.

167
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:50,170
One of the important pieces around like bullying interventions is that you have to kind of get

168
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:56,350
all the adults that could potentially be in the space on the same page around interventions,

169
00:18:56,350 --> 00:19:01,570
because it's not only the classroom teacher that might interface with the kids and an adult

170
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:06,759
like a bus driver or a playground monitor is on the same page about bullying interventions,

171
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:10,030
anti-bullying interventions. Then that's, you know, that's beneficial.

172
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:14,590
Okay. What else?

173
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:22,700
I think that's all I want to say. I just I like talking through pictures because I feel like it makes it more memorable.

174
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:28,190
But I just want to make sure I got everything that I was going to say about the press.

175
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:37,550
Oh, I know. The very last thing I will say, thinking about physical development are the backpacks.

176
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:39,259
The backpacks.

177
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:48,170
And I don't know if people have, like, personal memory, like you're speaking, but like to see kids with these really, really heavy backpacks.

178
00:19:49,160 --> 00:20:01,340
We know. And also here, there's vision, you know, neck musculature, spine growth, like all of these different things are impacted.

179
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:05,180
There's like heavy backpacks and then there's phone use.

180
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:12,790
And so those are two kind of physical world things that are becoming increasingly common for young kids.

181
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:18,740
Even though I laugh because I'm like my got my ninth grader now backpack is just as heavy.

182
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:23,329
He doesn't have any books in there. It's like a heavy Chromebook and I'm like, What else is in here?

183
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:27,409
Like a lunchbox like that? It's not some folders. It doesn't seem like it should be so heavy,

184
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:36,559
but it's quite heavy and and yet a lot of sort of moved online moving to more of this and like vision problems and crunched,

185
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:43,610
you know, shoulder and neck, which we all know, like we're going to spend many of us a lot of our time on a computer with a crunch neck.

186
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:47,780
And so if you're thinking about that starting at age six.

187
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:57,680
I would say that's kind of problematic. So it's it's tricky because there's also the issue of, you know, access.

188
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:04,050
Like it's easier to provide access to lots of materials, of course, online compared to having them in a heavy book.

189
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:10,470
Right. But it sort of has these ripple effects on physical growth and development.

190
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:25,110
Okay. Okay. So here's the other thing that I think is so important at this kind of a broad next stage is that we talk about age,

191
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:32,400
we talk about chronological age a lot, but that doesn't always map as we can appreciate to maturity level.

192
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:42,740
And of course, people's experience matters. Right. And so I talked about this kind of like broad range of how we define adolescence.

193
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:46,710
And, you know, this is like adults, emerging adults, young adults.

194
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:55,470
I would argue that covered again, probably have like taken people like shifted down this way in terms of thinking about,

195
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:59,820
you know, life skills, adaptive skills, interpersonal skills.

196
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:07,590
I think it's probably shifted downwards for a lot of people, not everybody, but for a lot of people.

197
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:22,860
And so when we think about this was already an issue, the fact that guidelines to do certain key things in life are age, chronological, age based.

198
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:29,630
There is already some variability around like for example, driver's licenses is a really obvious one.

199
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:36,670
So like, do we think all 16 year olds are like ready to operate motor vehicles?

200
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:46,380
So what do we think? Do we think that what would be some variability that around that age in particular?

201
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:49,110
Yeah, I would say just second and huge.

202
00:22:49,110 --> 00:23:01,049
I mean, you all 75 year olds for being able to drive, you know, what are the kinds of things you'd like to check in on about that if you're going to.

203
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:06,270
Yeah, I know like in my family specifically, my little brother is two years younger than me.

204
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:11,340
So I was 18 when he was getting ready to turn 16 and I got my license for it

205
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:16,950
on my birthday and my parents bought me a car and he was expecting the same.

206
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:24,540
And they were like, Listen, I know. And his biggest issue was like risk taking behavior.

207
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:29,820
He just was so willing to take a chance.

208
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:33,690
And I'll I'll beat that carpet, pull out in front of them. And, you know, that doesn't always work out.

209
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:39,240
So just his thinking that nothing bad is going to happen to him and [INAUDIBLE] be fine and.

210
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,590
Was a hindrance. And I think a lot of kids think that they're in school.

211
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:48,550
Yeah. Yeah. How did that go over with your brother?

212
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:53,829
Not well, but he ended up getting his license.

213
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:58,010
Just was very restricted for a while. Right, right, right.

214
00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:06,370
If we think about it, like those prefrontal cortex skills, like they don't they don't really develop.

215
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:14,230
So kind of out here fully. And then we have, as I remember from like temperament, we have those temperamental differences, right?

216
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:17,589
Like that my impulsive daughter screaming her Halloween costume.

217
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:23,829
Right. And so, yeah, like, there's a lot around driving that needs to be in place.

218
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:28,149
Like impulse control needs to be in place, you know, mechanical,

219
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:34,510
operational capacity to operate the vehicle and to remember which is the gas, which is the brake.

220
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:39,309
You know, maybe you have a key, maybe you don't have a key. Like that's something that I think is very fascinating.

221
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:46,540
A lot of cars now don't have a key in the ignition key stick shift driving like where the pass,

222
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:49,020
which I think is sort of sad personally because it was kind of fun.

223
00:24:49,240 --> 00:25:00,490
But yeah, look at that huge range of just kind of age and this goes from 10 to 25 and you know, driving occurs like right here in the middle.

224
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:05,710
And so there's just a lot a lot of variation there around this, like really key,

225
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:13,720
you know, kind of social, you know, change or achievement or status change, really.

226
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:20,470
What else should we consider for like driving in particular? Yeah. And it also like matters where you.

227
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:28,590
Because, for example, like my mom grew up on a farm and they were driving tractors at like 10 a.m. for them.

228
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:32,489
Like the car stuff was just like, right, like an adjustment, right.

229
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:39,030
So because. Right, because experience matters. Exactly. Very good observation because I think we do have is very different.

230
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:46,710
You know, in driving, I think it comes up a lot around driving because people do vary quite a bit in terms of exposure.

231
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:51,719
So like I have friends who like never learned how to drive as they both grew up in a big city,

232
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:56,180
they had great public transportation, they just didn't drive like there was no need to drive.

233
00:25:56,190 --> 00:26:00,100
And then they're like old quote unquote, they're like 30.

234
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,220
Like, Oh, I don't really drive.

235
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:07,410
And as an adult, like, if you have to rent a car or do something else that requires a car, like that becomes a problem.

236
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:14,220
So yeah, they're just going to add on to that because I also grew up in a very rural area driving tractors, four wheelers, whatever.

237
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:20,070
And for us, like, our parents were very much like, we don't have time to drag you everywhere and you need to drive to good places.

238
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:31,110
So do your thing. Right. It's totally functional, you know, for some contexts and kind of irrelevant for other contexts.

239
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:38,729
Right. And I think that that is, I think, a really interesting thing around driving in Michigan.

240
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:42,710
I don't know how many people got how many people get their driver's license in Michigan.

241
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:45,840
So many people have driver's licenses here. It's a lot of people.

242
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,959
So in Michigan and I don't know if this was true,

243
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:56,130
but you can actually start to take driver's ed and get your permit like at age 14 years, eight months.

244
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,170
People, not enough people have that experience.

245
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:06,870
We've just been going through that experience now with a boy who's pretty like relatively kind of calm and self it.

246
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:09,900
But I do go like oh a little bit.

247
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:13,169
But at the same time, if you look at the data,

248
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:20,549
it does show if you have this like more drawn out practice time and supervised driving time and restricted licenses,

249
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:24,210
like you can't drive after ten, you can't have friends in the car.

250
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:33,540
Those things have been linked to better, you know, fewer crashes, better, you know, outcomes in terms of car crash, fatality.

251
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:41,159
And I think it's interesting. I was going to ask, is Michigan because I'm not from Michigan, do they have the rule where I mean,

252
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:45,870
I was allowed to get a driver's license to drive to and from school when younger than 16.

253
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:52,840
I don't know is that a thing know it's you can drive and I need to brush up because I haven't I've

254
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:59,400
forgotten those specifics but you can drive kids you can drive to and from a sporting event with a permit,

255
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:05,250
I think. Or like with that with an early license, correct me if I'm wrong, people like, you know, this more detail, right?

256
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:11,070
So you get your license when you're 16, but it's still like a who they call it.

257
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:15,780
It's not provisional, but it's like restriction. Yeah, yeah.

258
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:23,760
Very restrictive. And it's like you have to drive with someone over 21 unless you're driving to school or a school event.

259
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:28,020
And in that case, to get if you have like one other non-family mom, I think that's what it is.

260
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:35,759
Yeah. So it's like and, and it's fascinating because what it comes up to is like speaking of sports, high school sports, right?

261
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:39,240
If you have a kid and this is my lived experience,

262
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:48,780
I have a freshman who is like all of a sudden on some sports team where there are seniors and they're like, Oh, we'll give them a ride home.

263
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:56,399
And you're like, Oh, really? But you know, my kid doesn't turn that these teens, you know?

264
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:00,900
And so it's a very big transition and yet it's super functional.

265
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:09,120
Right. We've talked so much about like parent stress and family chaos and like having a kid who drives can like less than one layer of that,

266
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:13,350
especially they can like drive their sibling, you know? Yeah.

267
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:22,290
And that's just like I've really thought to like I have a brother and like the problem isn't his capability or ability to drive it.

268
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:28,199
But I think I'm cool and I want to like race here and, and do this and my friends are with me.

269
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:32,950
It's like that is why you can't drive. Not like literally just being able to do something.

270
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:36,390
So yeah, that's a lot of contact support, don't you think?

271
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:42,479
Yes, absolutely. And distractibility and having peers in the car.

272
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:52,650
So there's like a sort of a sharp increase of crashes and basically drop off of survival rates the more peers you have in the car.

273
00:29:53,970 --> 00:30:01,800
And so that's a direct sort of line from like in research on like number of peers teens drive with in the car,

274
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:09,090
you know, data around crashes and mortality fatalities and, you know, these driving restrictions.

275
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:13,350
So being in Michigan, which is like obviously a heavy driving focus state.

276
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:20,820
For better or for worse, um, we've actually, I think it's one of the more like nuanced.

277
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:24,320
Driving progressions in the country.

278
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:31,280
But it's still like these sort of individual differences I'm thinking about, okay, 14 year old boys like that,

279
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:38,120
you know, to be operating these vehicles is potentially, you know, occasions pause.

280
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:43,940
And that's also, of course, you know, not noting.

281
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:50,270
But I feel like I would be remiss not to note obviously there's texting and mobile devices, right, present with everybody.

282
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:58,560
And so just that combination is hard and of course, hard to regulate as well.

283
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:05,000
Right. The other argument like mobile device, like if they're texting physically, you know, or even you know,

284
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:11,030
it's better to like text by voice, but you're like psychological or attentional distraction.

285
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:15,340
If you're texting even by voice and you're not using your hands at all is still there.

286
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:21,980
Right. So there's like the two parts of the driving distraction, the physical and changing radio stations or whatever it is.

287
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:28,940
But even if you're just sort of like or even listening to a podcast, you know, there's lots of ways we can all be distracted by driving.

288
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:34,990
We can all you can all appreciate that. And then thinking about these sort of teen brains that are, you know,

289
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:45,739
having hormonal fluctuations and not developed and all sorts of things driving a as intense another kind of big area where this comes up.

290
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:53,090
And this was a little bit in these readings, but the idea of staying home alone and sort of babysitting, right, babysitting.

291
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:59,060
It's in quotes because like thinking about the older siblings, watching their younger siblings writing, like, how many of us have done that?

292
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:09,439
So that's probably yeah. And so this is sort of an interesting like gray area in terms of age cutoffs, maturity level,

293
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:14,630
family circumstance, like who needs the kids to stay home and watch the younger kids?

294
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:23,510
And this is an interesting area because again, it varies a lot by kind of setting,

295
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:31,969
but also people have talked about like putting more regulation around this age cutoff.

296
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:36,890
So just sort of thinking through like your own experiences or thinking through that,

297
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:46,370
do you think that it would be, you know, any kind of optimal age or reasons for ways to regulate this?

298
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:51,490
This being said, I'm staying at home watching sports.

299
00:32:53,420 --> 00:33:03,680
Yeah, it's really tough because it's also kind of like I feel like my parents left me at home to take care of my younger siblings.

300
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:07,740
And these are a lot younger than than they would be with my other siblings.

301
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:12,740
So I think a lot of it is like parent discretion, which maybe it shouldn't be,

302
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:22,250
but I feel like it's very so much on like whether they're able to feel confident, like maybe they shouldn't have to do that anyways.

303
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,920
Like you have to feel like responsible.

304
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:35,090
So in that case need to have some regulation and even like it could be kid personality, it could be like older child ness, right?

305
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:39,860
That has maybe sort of shaped kid personality. So it's very, you know, it's complicated.

306
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:46,040
Yeah. I thought I had heard of some like was around ages.

307
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:55,529
And when the kids can be left alone, I think that's hard to enforce, but also very situational because like even the reading mentioned,

308
00:33:55,530 --> 00:33:59,480
there's some foundation for child care because that still have to work.

309
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:07,880
And then that is how you tell the parent to not take care of the family, how they home.

310
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:11,300
Yeah. So I think it I think it's difficult in that way too.

311
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:14,599
Yeah. Yeah. And definitely and we'll talk about it a little bit more.

312
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:17,329
But yeah, the sort of minimum age things,

313
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:25,310
a lot of states have no minimum age and this has been like sort of hotly debated and little, you know, some policy fields over here.

314
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:34,140
But those ages really do range quite a bit. Where there is a guideline from like six is basically this range of like 6 to 12, 6 to 14.

315
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:38,839
Yeah. Yeah. I was just thinking, not just like the age.

316
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:44,750
Being like home alone is a factor, but I feel like the time alone is also maybe more of a factor.

317
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:48,370
So it's like one hour versus like, oh, you were.

318
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:54,080
You were alone for two days. Huh? I think that makes a difference, too.

319
00:34:54,620 --> 00:35:00,130
Yeah, absolutely. Right. And like time, time, length of time and also time of day time.

320
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:06,170
Right. Um, we talked about like that sort of after school time.

321
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:11,149
It's a great time for intervention, like out of school time interventions.

322
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:16,010
Afterschool interventions are really important not only for sort of instilling like if it's arts and

323
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:19,790
music and exposure to creative writing or other things you may not be getting during the school day,

324
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:25,010
but also sort of filling kids time, acting as, you know, child care opportunity.

325
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:33,409
It's also an after school time historically has been known as like the pregnancy time by older teens.

326
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:42,230
So kids being home alone after school prior to parents getting home from work is like a high pregnancy risk time.

327
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:46,250
Um, and then I know.

328
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:51,710
And then thinking about, you know, just parents work schedules, right?

329
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:58,130
Like opportunities to put your kids places very like if you're a shift worker and you're working at night,

330
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:06,860
those childcare needs or even like kind of, you know, bigger kids needs are really different from somebody who's working at 9 to 5 job right.

331
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:15,740
Or working from home. So it's, it's pretty interesting. Um, and then the other, another kind of guideline here too is like being paid for work.

332
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:20,270
So again, like, I don't know if you guys remember kind of like having your first job kind of thing,

333
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:28,280
but there are certainly, you know, different guidelines depending on lots of things.

334
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:35,540
But so for like, for example, babysitting, like for one's neighbor, for example, is like an unregulated space.

335
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:46,100
And so you can get paid as a younger kid for babysitting, but you can't get paid yet, you know, to do other things until you like hit 16, for example.

336
00:36:49,130 --> 00:37:00,220
There's also just talking to a family last night at Halloween about kids doing like a let's call it like a city,

337
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:07,460
like a camp, a camp counselor in training kind of program where they're the counselor in training.

338
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:15,670
But the parent is paying for the kid to go to the camp so that the kid can then kind of be like a counselor and training for other kids.

339
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:21,470
And we were just talking about like, that's interesting for kids kind of providing a service to younger kids,

340
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:26,230
but the parent is also paying for the kid to go and do that service.

341
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:32,750
And so it's just like a very interesting conversation kind of around all of these things, like should they be paying my kid?

342
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:35,149
But the kid's 14 and like, what does that mean?

343
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:43,370
So anyway, it was very interesting and I think it just sort of highlights like there's just a lot of like flux and I think for that reason.

344
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:52,790
So not only is COVID important to consider in all of these things, but I think that bigger contextual piece which will.

345
00:37:54,440 --> 00:38:04,790
But like how much kind of is your family regulated given the context that they're living in around these issues?

346
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:11,599
Right. So some parents may not have child care options and are often forced to leave kids for longer.

347
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:15,230
And then when is that okay? When is that not okay?

348
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:18,649
Right. Who can do that and who can't do that in terms of getting regulated?

349
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:19,910
So we'll talk a little bit more about that.

350
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:28,010
Oh, the other thing about Cobra that I just wanted to note is that like I keep saying, like, we'll see, we're going to see what happens.

351
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:31,910
And so in part that's because like we don't have the data and we don't know.

352
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:39,980
But also thinking about like sleeper effects, which means basically that like your impact could be happening.

353
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:46,610
It's kind of like aces maybe. Right. So it's like the impact on your development in certain areas could be happening when you're like five years old,

354
00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:53,180
but you may not see that impact play out, tell you till later on in development.

355
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:57,650
And so I think that we kind of just need to keep an eye again on that cohort effect,

356
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:07,400
like how old kids were when they went through like the depths of COVID and particularly school closures in terms of where they're like,

357
00:39:07,850 --> 00:39:12,950
you know, learning deficits, for example, might might pop up. So that's what sleep affects me.

358
00:39:14,570 --> 00:39:19,490
Okay. And I think this is kind of built into these questions.

359
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:27,410
We've had some discussion on this, but like these definitions of like, you know, do you call 13 year old a kid or an adolescent?

360
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:33,530
And like, how does that shape, you know, people's expectations of like whether they should like in that example,

361
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:38,140
I was just talking about like be a camper who is going to a camp or who should be like a,

362
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:41,920
you know, a counselor and training who's getting paid for their work at that camp.

363
00:39:41,930 --> 00:39:51,080
So that kid in that like, you know, let's say 10 to 14 age range, it's really could be kid or adolescent and like, should a kid be driving or a teen?

364
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:54,800
You know, how do we think about those things? Okay.

365
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:59,000
So all of so that's all just age.

366
00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:02,059
Oh, yeah. Sorry. Yeah.

367
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:10,870
It's usually different also because I like notice that they're always like, oh, yeah, like, like they can tell visually, like a little different.

368
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:14,000
Like, they're like, oh, I don't like I'm so responsible.

369
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:21,809
Well, no, that's not right.

370
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:27,960
And probably that's something that probably does vary by kid and it probably also varies by like how much responsibility they've been given.

371
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:32,819
Right. Like there's certain domains that they might think of themselves as like super responsible.

372
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:38,820
And I have all these different things that I do and I know how to do, and I've been given autonomy to do.

373
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:43,860
And there's other domains that I don't feel like, you know, I've grown up or a teen.

374
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:48,210
I feel like a kid. And I think that that also can vary like, you know, by the day.

375
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:52,470
Right. Because of just how the different things that kids are encountering.

376
00:40:54,390 --> 00:41:05,100
I, I think that thinking about like COVID and parent anxiety as well as kid anxiety also is likely going to shape that because kids, it's true,

377
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:17,220
like kids haven't had as much experience as like in terms of like navigating a an adult free peer zone when they're eight,

378
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:21,180
as like prior eight year olds have had in terms of experience.

379
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:27,540
So like they are probably less competent but at the same time, like not, you know,

380
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:33,749
not letting them do things because we fear they're less competent is going to be problematic like over time too.

381
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:42,660
So I think it's those adult expectations I think are important when we're thinking about encouraging kids to do things on their own.

382
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:52,860
And so kind of throwing puberty in there does impact, you know, lots of the system.

383
00:41:54,060 --> 00:42:06,629
And so that like interview and the TED talk around sort of early puberty specifically is important

384
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:12,920
to kind of consider the other things that we know about early puberty as she was noting here,

385
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:24,570
I'll just kind of pull up these this this study is that so early puberty in itself is associated with increased mental health considered concerns.

386
00:42:27,810 --> 00:42:39,120
And just thinking about that TED talk and kind of these other social things we've been thinking about what are some like

387
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:50,219
pathways or reasons for why that association might exist between kind of early puberty and and mental health in this case,

388
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:56,630
depression that. Mental health or social adjustment considerations?

389
00:42:57,170 --> 00:43:01,280
Yes, I like it if you think you're being too passive.

390
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:06,080
With your class and my freedom for the rest of my life.

391
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:13,990
Seventh grade class can make sense then. So it's like there are people who are going suspension of not moving.

392
00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:17,530
Oh, so that could be like something that could affect.

393
00:43:18,990 --> 00:43:21,990
Potentially like people in the like either best.

394
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:32,309
Yeah. So, yeah. I feel like you. You're not quite divine.

395
00:43:32,310 --> 00:43:38,070
So like if your breasts are developing earlier, then people label you as like kind of this.

396
00:43:38,890 --> 00:43:43,390
Sexualize them because there's so much media exposure. It's like, Oh, she has boobs.

397
00:43:43,390 --> 00:43:49,150
And then that's kind of like your label or your dad, and it's maybe not, but like you are.

398
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:55,100
Mm hmm. And that might be, like, a little bit of a connection there.

399
00:43:55,720 --> 00:44:03,430
Yeah, definitely. Right. Sort of like inferring, like, behavioral choices from, like, physical attributes, for sure.

400
00:44:03,490 --> 00:44:10,380
Yeah. Another one that often feels like the clothes where, like, you don't wear uniforms, they're really for others.

401
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:14,480
So then, like, you're getting paid a lot for something, like, sort of. How?

402
00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:21,790
Yeah, but it's more hypersexualized.

403
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:26,350
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Yeah, exactly.

404
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:30,399
Also thinking of also, like, the support.

405
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:35,170
So like, if you were like, I mean, it does come in more and more common that it happens earlier,

406
00:44:35,170 --> 00:44:40,540
but like you may not know anyone or like not being embarrassed and not feel comfortable, like going to your parents or something.

407
00:44:40,990 --> 00:44:48,370
And so then you're processing a lot of like changes like emotions and bodily changes like on your own.

408
00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:57,160
And so not having like a buffer to that and way of like understanding and learning and it just adds to the stress and.

409
00:44:58,090 --> 00:45:02,110
Yeah. And like thinking like again to that the thought.

410
00:45:02,110 --> 00:45:06,729
But like if you haven't had peers like so much more as like riding on the parents, right.

411
00:45:06,730 --> 00:45:14,460
About these kids who are like 10 to 13 across this pandemic and like having pubertal development,

412
00:45:14,470 --> 00:45:20,410
having these milestones happen and you know, maybe your parents are comfortable talking about that, maybe they're not.

413
00:45:20,410 --> 00:45:24,720
And like, there's not as much of a peer network to kind of turn to.

414
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:28,620
Yeah. Yeah. I was also thinking about like menstrual cycles too.

415
00:45:29,110 --> 00:45:34,380
And so like just kind of navigating that through the first time and kind of just you were saying with like support your peers

416
00:45:34,390 --> 00:45:40,330
not having gone through the initial cycle like you're the only one and you're experiencing the same thing in other things.

417
00:45:40,450 --> 00:45:45,580
I mean like the craziness in middle school. So going through that too and I kind of I'm just like,

418
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:55,390
I think about when I was like little the ways I would try to minimize the crinkling you'd hear in the bathroom.

419
00:45:55,390 --> 00:46:00,310
But just going through that, too. Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

420
00:46:00,310 --> 00:46:07,060
And like, right. Like we can reflect on sort of like middle school and so often like a time of drama and like when you think about,

421
00:46:07,510 --> 00:46:15,430
you know, especially if you overlay over puberty, overlay these gender differences between like thinking about,

422
00:46:15,490 --> 00:46:20,950
you know, the extremes like sixth grade boys, middle school and like eighth grade girls,

423
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:26,439
middle school, same school context, not always the same classes, but like same context.

424
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:36,389
And so that's a huge difference. On average between, you know, kind of like height, pubertal development interests, lots of things.

425
00:46:36,390 --> 00:46:41,640
Right. And that were they're all sort of team together in middle school and like that's sort of its own thing.

426
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:45,330
But then thinking about with COVID, that didn't happen.

427
00:46:45,330 --> 00:46:53,159
And so kids, you know, going from kind of ending at fifth grade when not everybody but many people are still kind of kid,

428
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:56,700
like for sure, not everybody to like,

429
00:46:57,030 --> 00:46:58,739
you know, eighth or ninth grade,

430
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:07,020
they're sort of getting into this sort of like full preteen zone with a gap in the middle that was sort of like family mediated.

431
00:47:07,470 --> 00:47:12,930
I just feel like it's there's a lot more variability to in terms of what people have experienced.

432
00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:16,500
Yeah. And I think even like students is like mental health.

433
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:21,300
Like some parents don't believe that, you know, a way.

434
00:47:21,870 --> 00:47:27,500
Yeah. Like you're not going through anything right to what they're experiencing.

435
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:33,780
So like based on your parents that you know, is absolutely right.

436
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:41,490
And that and that there's no kind of like external check in people that, you know, hopefully could exist in middle schools context.

437
00:47:41,610 --> 00:47:44,610
We know schools understaffed in terms of mental health.

438
00:47:44,610 --> 00:47:51,059
But and so thinking about implications for that, thinking about like middle school,

439
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:54,690
what we're doing in middle school or learning and like this sort of middle school kind of

440
00:47:54,690 --> 00:48:00,479
time or like late elementary to like early high school things like coping strategies,

441
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,910
you know, figuring out what works for you.

442
00:48:02,910 --> 00:48:08,600
That's maybe different from how your family approaches things and getting exposure to how different, you know,

443
00:48:08,610 --> 00:48:14,729
families or kids who maybe go to other people's houses at times and sort of see how different things work.

444
00:48:14,730 --> 00:48:21,900
All of that also sort of didn't happen for, you know, kids who are kind of passing through these phases during COVID.

445
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:25,050
So I think that is another important application to think about.

446
00:48:27,450 --> 00:48:40,440
And I think so she talked a lot about in the video, like environmental exposures and links to sort of body fat and estrogen levels.

447
00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:45,989
So that's certainly like a point of prevention and intervention.

448
00:48:45,990 --> 00:48:50,580
So those of us who are and again, like we talked a bit about environmental health,

449
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:56,760
but this is another huge impact in terms of environmental health and toxic exposures.

450
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:04,110
Are this like early puberty and biological, you know, sort of early puberty socially?

451
00:49:04,830 --> 00:49:08,340
It's maybe caused through environmental exposures to some degree.

452
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:15,090
And then sort of like what are the ramifications of, you know, the environmental exposures,

453
00:49:15,090 --> 00:49:20,280
the social factors and then over time and how that might map one to mental health.

454
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:27,090
So it's a very complex set of considerations.

455
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:36,180
Other things about that TED talk around early puberty and the environmental exposures that

456
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:42,020
people have learned anything new from that one or were surprised by anything that they saw.

457
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:50,489
Yeah I think they like appreciated in the in the reading that like she talked about like it the emphasis

458
00:49:50,490 --> 00:49:56,069
is on like either like moms or families like talking to girls who may be going through puberty early,

459
00:49:56,070 --> 00:50:02,520
but like also having that conversation with boys about like how they should be treating girls so that to mitigate some of that,

460
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:05,250
like bullying or like sexualizing, that happens.

461
00:50:06,450 --> 00:50:11,249
And I think that's very important because I think like oftentimes it's like, oh, this is like what a what a girl was going through.

462
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:15,420
So like, these are the things that like putting all that responsibility on the girl to like learn how to do things.

463
00:50:15,630 --> 00:50:19,500
Yeah, I think it's so important yet to address that like peer education piece about like,

464
00:50:19,830 --> 00:50:23,130
no, how can you help kind of make this process a little easier to?

465
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:26,880
So it's really a good point.

466
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:30,240
And again, something that that probably has fallen off.

467
00:50:30,810 --> 00:50:36,390
But, you know, the lack of expert like if you're in an all female family and you're never exposed to,

468
00:50:36,690 --> 00:50:42,749
you know, boys, especially peer boys for two years, then like it just amps the whole thing potentially.

469
00:50:42,750 --> 00:50:46,570
Right. So that's a that's a lot to think about. Absolutely.

470
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:50,759
Good point. Yeah, I like like I didn't know that this was a thing.

471
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:56,250
So like if I was really interesting, I did think, though, that like our recommendations were kind of limited.

472
00:50:56,610 --> 00:51:03,719
Like at the end, she would very much like just individual choices that don't get cookies to part reward and stuff like that.

473
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:05,730
And I think that often gets used.

474
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:13,290
It's like overweighted like prevention, but I think it's more societal stuff and like what if they can't afford to get the help and stuff like that?

475
00:51:13,290 --> 00:51:21,060
And so it's like it puts the blame on like individual parents and stuff, which I don't think so, but I overall thought she was great,

476
00:51:21,570 --> 00:51:27,000
you know, but I'm glad and I kind of and I like and again, like Bay Area Native, I'm very sensitive to that.

477
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:31,520
And so she she said something about like. You know, in San Francisco, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

478
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:39,500
And I think it's very easy to be like have different if you're in an environment that's like got some awesome choices,

479
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:45,350
but not all environments have awesome choices and those awesome choices can be really expensive as well, obviously.

480
00:51:45,350 --> 00:51:52,040
And so I think just like we were talking about sort of like early childhood obesity prevention, like it's like very,

481
00:51:52,040 --> 00:52:00,320
very similar big picture constraints that are operating that makes it not so simple to make that different choice.

482
00:52:00,330 --> 00:52:02,400
So yeah, but you have that.

483
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:12,300
And like changing like the food labels like the labeling for foods she was losing on things like cancer really have control

484
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:20,800
over but also like the food types like the drinks that you should be buying less sugar as my kids put it in the car.

485
00:52:20,830 --> 00:52:24,930
I'm not going to take that as I don't like that.

486
00:52:24,930 --> 00:52:28,440
That's the thing that I understand what I'm saying.

487
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:31,710
But it also is just like very unrealistic,

488
00:52:31,730 --> 00:52:41,040
especially like on things like Wake or something that like that's like the specific thing that they buy or just a diet that they only eat.

489
00:52:41,550 --> 00:52:46,020
Oh, I saw when I was some kid only eat like pizza.

490
00:52:46,290 --> 00:52:54,270
Like, that's it. Like, you know, so like trying to like switch to and type and like putting on the parents like switch.

491
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:57,330
That diet is like a lot.

492
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:05,850
And also she said like the growth I had my father figures also played a role in developing

493
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:11,550
like early puberty and I still haven't really I think I don't see that connection.

494
00:53:12,010 --> 00:53:16,049
Yeah. It's I don't know if other people said that in their comments too.

495
00:53:16,050 --> 00:53:22,140
And that's always something that is a little bit like hot because that actually is replicated in like other obesity studies in literature.

496
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:30,900
And so I think it could be just like a signal that's being picked up from other sources,

497
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:39,000
you know, like, you know, like confounder basically, right, for going to statistical terms.

498
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:43,950
But it's also interesting to think about because some people have proposed like some

499
00:53:43,950 --> 00:53:50,009
biological hypotheses to around that that father figure presence thing and obesity prevention.

500
00:53:50,010 --> 00:53:56,809
So. Personally, I feel like it's much more likely to be like a confounded factor.

501
00:53:56,810 --> 00:54:01,549
But some studies have tried to like pull that apart and some evidence is still like that.

502
00:54:01,550 --> 00:54:06,290
This father presence is protective. And so I agree.

503
00:54:06,290 --> 00:54:09,890
I'm like, is it like more gross motor plane when they're young kids?

504
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:13,250
You know, like there's a lot of different things one could think about.

505
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:23,990
But I it it's an interesting thing and I don't know, like where it could go or what, like a prevention thing for that.

506
00:54:24,470 --> 00:54:28,070
Like sort of an odd finding. So I'm glad you brought that one up, too.

507
00:54:28,470 --> 00:54:32,330
Yeah, yeah. Because it mentioned about fathers and whatnot.

508
00:54:32,330 --> 00:54:41,390
And I just kind of wonder what message that sends for, like, LGBTQ families who are not eligible fathers, not their present.

509
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:44,630
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Yeah.

510
00:54:44,690 --> 00:54:50,870
I think it's sort of a like it's out there and so like I kind of like that thought

511
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:54,950
because it says a few things that are like maybe a little feel a little bit like,

512
00:54:55,220 --> 00:55:04,040
well, really. And I think it also has a lot of really good, you know, information in terms of presenting some of this exposure science.

513
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:11,809
But there are these like conundrums because then when you do get to prevention, you're like, should we have like a token male in the home?

514
00:55:11,810 --> 00:55:15,080
Like, that doesn't make any sense, right? Yeah. So yeah, yeah.

515
00:55:15,890 --> 00:55:22,910
I also think that now that there's a lot more context, like there are more human households than there were before,

516
00:55:23,390 --> 00:55:30,140
I think that maybe like if there's something like it will either go back and build like revisit that like,

517
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:36,020
oh, this, this, there's this link or it's just like it turns out it's just like stress in general that could come from any like and whatever.

518
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:38,330
But I think that having, like,

519
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:48,140
nontraditional high schools now will probably open a lot more eyes to other things that might be issues and not just like fathers that are missing.

520
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:50,390
Yeah. Yeah, I think that's a good point.

521
00:55:50,390 --> 00:55:58,280
And that goes for like so many different areas of research, but it kind of, uh, it prompts us to say like, we really don't know.

522
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:03,829
And some of these things I think are like an artifact of the research that exists to date.

523
00:56:03,830 --> 00:56:10,730
And so an argument for this is actually really important to study and see what things look like in, you know,

524
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:18,560
households that are made up of different, you know, genders in a way that we could like kind of try to decouple some of these things.

525
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:23,290
Yeah, we're seeing now of like more and more single mothers just being like the same, you know,

526
00:56:23,390 --> 00:56:29,570
thing or just like mothers choosing to not have a male in the house, you know, just wants to take care of a child by themselves,

527
00:56:30,140 --> 00:56:37,850
which I think is important, which like shame, not just because they want to have a child or sometimes there is a man in the picture,

528
00:56:37,850 --> 00:56:41,120
but he's not even he's not like well equipped to do this.

529
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:43,159
And you and you could be worse for the child development.

530
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:51,140
So, again, not shaming the women who want to like say that you should not be part of my child's life because for the safety or, you know, whatever.

531
00:56:51,230 --> 00:56:55,610
Yeah. Yeah. And it is.

532
00:56:55,940 --> 00:57:03,589
It is. Yeah. It's a really I would say like it's a conundrum because this finding keeps popping up.

533
00:57:03,590 --> 00:57:06,830
But I think it's kind of an artifact of the cohorts that are studied.

534
00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:12,229
I think it's likely due to some confounding of these bigger picture issues.

535
00:57:12,230 --> 00:57:14,660
And I think that like we need to know more.

536
00:57:15,530 --> 00:57:25,880
And I'll just say also like just speaking of puberty and thinking of like multiple, you know, female gender parents,

537
00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:34,940
one of the hypotheses is like, well, maybe there's something to do with like cycling and estrogen and menstrual cycles.

538
00:57:34,940 --> 00:57:38,599
And that would be a testable hypothesis, right?

539
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:42,320
If you were like, oh, all female families look this way.

540
00:57:42,710 --> 00:57:48,680
And, you know, families where there's a male presence look this way and like, we have no idea, really.

541
00:57:48,980 --> 00:57:56,150
I suspect that's probably not like a driving force, but I think it's a it's an unknown, right?

542
00:57:57,970 --> 00:58:02,030
Oh, yeah. No, I was going to kind of share the some of the new stuff from the article.

543
00:58:02,180 --> 00:58:06,889
Oh, sure, sure, sure. Yeah, yeah. Well, this led to an article in The New Yorker.

544
00:58:06,890 --> 00:58:12,290
I could send it out because what they were showing actually how like in during

545
00:58:12,290 --> 00:58:16,159
like lockdown periods like this one I think studied like different countries,

546
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:23,510
the referrals for early puberty doubled. And so they're like looking at what else may be causing.

547
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:28,850
So they're looking at like mental health and then also like sleep patterns and melatonin.

548
00:58:29,390 --> 00:58:39,340
And because they said it was like rising like been years right before, but then like in 2020, they saw like a big spike like across like everywhere.

549
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:46,069
So I'm very curious. Obviously it's very new and fresh. So yeah, it's not determined.

550
00:58:46,070 --> 00:58:50,900
But yeah, I think it's Thursday's readings that go in more like technology.

551
00:58:51,530 --> 00:58:55,249
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, there's so much. There's like, so much.

552
00:58:55,250 --> 00:59:00,310
And I was just. Yeah, I've kind of skimmed that. Jackie sent me that. It's like, ooh, to update.

553
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:09,440
But like in so many things, I think we're going to see this like stair step thing with covert and, and in some ways things are so overdetermined.

554
00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:14,780
One of my favorite, favorite words in addition to, you know, aspirational.

555
00:59:15,050 --> 00:59:20,330
But some things really are like very overdetermined. It's like, are we surprised?

556
00:59:20,330 --> 00:59:22,159
And we'll talk about with like swirling effects, too.

557
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:30,020
But like, are you surprised that there's like an increase in obesity rates and increase in, you know, a decrease in math, you know,

558
00:59:30,020 --> 00:59:36,650
that maybe parents don't feel equipped to help their kids with math during two years of lockdown, like, oh, my goodness, really, this is a surprise.

559
00:59:36,710 --> 00:59:40,910
But yet people are kind of I feel like right now there's all these sort of findings

560
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:43,430
that are kind of coming out or things that are coming out and people are saying like,

561
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:48,229
well, in the last two years, and I'm like, really, you're going to, you know,

562
00:59:48,230 --> 00:59:52,220
again, make a decision on this based on the last few years of life experience.

563
00:59:52,230 --> 00:59:56,059
It's just we just need to know more carefully what's going on.

564
00:59:56,060 --> 01:00:01,969
And I think this question of like, are we surprised by whatever findings we're talking about?

565
01:00:01,970 --> 01:00:07,129
What are the pathways through which this may have happened and what are the implications?

566
01:00:07,130 --> 01:00:15,110
So I think those are always really key questions to kind of keep in mind, especially when I think about, you know, trying to track COVID impacts.

567
01:00:15,710 --> 01:00:24,170
Um, and let me say a few other things around these readings because I want to make sure we just touch on this.

568
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:35,870
We have a little bit already, but I like these kind of little pieces because they're so about like charging parents, which we do all the time, right?

569
01:00:35,870 --> 01:00:43,669
We like judge parents constantly and we and we like to, you know, give advice and recommendations and all of that stuff, right?

570
01:00:43,670 --> 01:00:46,790
We're like the find interventionists, like hanging over parents.

571
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:53,460
And I think that like some of the things were speaking of gender of parents, like, you know,

572
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:59,900
if a father left a baby in a car for 10 minutes versus a mother like, we judge that differently.

573
01:01:00,110 --> 01:01:06,410
We judge that decision differently, which I just think is, you know, a little enraging and just kind of ridiculous.

574
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:17,660
We do things like begun speaking of dads, we we say sometimes that like dads are like babysitting, like that term of like dads.

575
01:01:17,660 --> 01:01:19,850
My dad, you know, the dad is going to babysit the kids.

576
01:01:19,850 --> 01:01:24,800
And it's like, well, actually, they're just the parent of the kids, so they're just being the parent of the kid.

577
01:01:26,030 --> 01:01:29,600
And so I think that some of these factors are kind of come up in that study.

578
01:01:30,170 --> 01:01:38,900
And then I think this is like the really critical kind of public health and policy and like social justice question is this issue of like,

579
01:01:39,590 --> 01:01:45,020
you know, how and who can decide, you know, when kids staying home alone,

580
01:01:45,380 --> 01:01:52,220
when kids you know, I'm sure I've seen news stories about like kids that were playing in a park, you know, and,

581
01:01:52,370 --> 01:01:58,400
you know, kind of police coming by and, you know, getting the parent in trouble for leaving the kids in a park.

582
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:04,340
That happens in like certain neighborhoods and not in other neighborhoods, as with many other things we know.

583
01:02:04,340 --> 01:02:08,690
And then I post up there this like the age based guidelines.

584
01:02:08,690 --> 01:02:15,229
And like I said, this is sort of like hotly debated these age based guidelines, partly because of some of these headlines like this.

585
01:02:15,230 --> 01:02:19,910
Like, you know what, you know, the headline just says, like, live in a poor neighborhood.

586
01:02:19,910 --> 01:02:21,760
Better be a perfect parent. Right?

587
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:29,000
So it means like, you know, somebody in a wealthier neighborhood could, like say, I've got to run to the grocery store.

588
01:02:29,570 --> 01:02:33,530
Kids play in the park for, you know, an hour. While I do that,

589
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:45,739
the likelihood of that parent getting in trouble or being reported to CPS for doing that is much lower than

590
01:02:45,740 --> 01:02:51,680
a parent who is living in a more dangerous neighborhood or poor neighborhood who does the same thing.

591
01:02:52,340 --> 01:02:58,130
And like, is the child in objectively more danger?

592
01:02:58,370 --> 01:03:07,639
Like, maybe, maybe not. But the impact on through the parent's life is greater and the parent may have

593
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:12,170
less choice in terms of if they're living in a lower income neighborhood,

594
01:03:13,190 --> 01:03:18,710
there may be, you know, more job work requirements on that parent that are not flexible.

595
01:03:19,250 --> 01:03:21,860
And so the parent needs to make some harder choices.

596
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:31,700
And also the parent is under more scrutiny by one of the legal public health professionals that are monitoring all of this.

597
01:03:31,700 --> 01:03:33,860
So that's just important to kind of keep in mind.

598
01:03:34,190 --> 01:03:42,049
And I think it does play into all this, like what age at which what is the age at which children can stay home alone?

599
01:03:42,050 --> 01:03:48,920
Like it really depends on context and sometimes I think some of this discussion.

600
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:55,340
Some of it acknowledges context, and some of it doesn't always sense all that tricky.

601
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:59,669
Yeah, I just think it's like a little hypocritical, like thinking of how we were just talking about,

602
01:03:59,670 --> 01:04:03,390
like, childcare and like people like this idea of collective responsibility.

603
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:09,120
But then like the readings we had where people were like seeing a kid in a car, they have to like report it.

604
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:13,700
And I'm like. Funny how when it comes to child care and people are like, you figure it out, right?

605
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:21,480
Parent your child how you want to. But in these instances, they all feel like I'm good enough for this child safety is I think like seeing how we were

606
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:24,510
just talking about that is like it's kind of frustrating to me because it's just like,

607
01:04:24,510 --> 01:04:30,000
well, the offer for universal health care, them, all these kids wouldn't have to be left alone in the park if you're so worried about their safety.

608
01:04:31,130 --> 01:04:38,520
Yeah, right. And like, if you remember with that Lanham Act and the Rosie the Riveter law was like, oh, my goodness, kids are being left in cars.

609
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:41,870
We should provide them a place to go and not be left in cars.

610
01:04:41,930 --> 01:04:45,479
And so you're absolutely right. And it various really by issue, right.

611
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:53,340
We can think of lots of different issues where like it's in the personal domain or it's in the, you know, kind of regulated domain.

612
01:04:53,340 --> 01:04:59,819
And I think that what's important with like a headline like this is that parents who

613
01:04:59,820 --> 01:05:06,590
are trying to parent in more sort of challenging circumstances have fewer options,

614
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:13,700
get in more trouble, and are like held to a higher standard than other parents.

615
01:05:13,710 --> 01:05:15,660
And so I think that is what is problematic.

616
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:22,469
And you know, again, as we kind of think about different public health settings that we might go to professionally,

617
01:05:22,470 --> 01:05:26,910
like keeping that in mind, which is hard sometimes, right?

618
01:05:26,910 --> 01:05:33,240
But it's really critically important for thinking about parents and what options they have.

619
01:05:36,090 --> 01:05:39,450
Let's see other. Okay.

620
01:05:41,130 --> 01:05:51,810
That's comments on that one. I'm going to shift a little bit to just I know I'm talking a lot, but we have some class contributions.

621
01:05:52,170 --> 01:05:58,659
I wanted to just go through this, these examples, and it's just a different way of thinking about this idea of like individual factors.

622
01:05:58,660 --> 01:06:07,170
So like personality, temperament, things that we've talked about before in schooling contexts, these kind of come up.

623
01:06:07,260 --> 01:06:13,200
So it's like this multiple intelligences theory, which is sort of out there.

624
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:18,000
And well, if you talk to educational psychologists that they, you know,

625
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:25,770
some of this informs some thinking in educational psychology that sort of these are some different ideas of like multiple intelligences.

626
01:06:25,770 --> 01:06:30,059
Right. And you've heard like, oh, I'm a kinesthetic learner, I'm a visual learner.

627
01:06:30,060 --> 01:06:36,990
And, you know, the research I would say, is like mixed on these different kind of learning styles overall.

628
01:06:37,470 --> 01:06:43,200
But if we think about these things like musical, visual, spatial, verbal, linguistic, logical, mathematical,

629
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:49,230
bodily, kinesthetic, interpersonal, intra personal, like self-knowledge, naturalistic, so like natural world.

630
01:06:50,130 --> 01:06:53,040
Like if you think about those kind of as like personality factors,

631
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:57,479
almost like we can all matter individuals who like shine in different areas of those.

632
01:06:57,480 --> 01:07:02,459
But what is important to remember is like, you know, which of these are most valued in school?

633
01:07:02,460 --> 01:07:09,600
And back to those kind of original pictures, if we don't expose kids at these early ages to these different options,

634
01:07:09,990 --> 01:07:14,219
they might never know or they might never learn. Like, Hey, I'm really amazing in the natural world.

635
01:07:14,220 --> 01:07:21,450
Like, that's my place, you know? But if they don't get the opportunity, then they won't be able to develop in that in that space.

636
01:07:21,450 --> 01:07:30,980
And you know, I would say clearly verbal, linguistic, logical, mathematical, those are pretty much what's valued in school.

637
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:38,220
Like I would say, on average, the others are not. So that's sort of an example of individual factor.

638
01:07:38,670 --> 01:07:45,030
And in this developmental exam example of how we sort of are shaped in our functioning in this childhood period,

639
01:07:45,570 --> 01:07:55,049
that's that sort of minimum age factor. And as we got to in our discussion like context and kind of child factors might shape those decisions.

640
01:07:55,050 --> 01:08:02,370
So like your development is a factor, but it's sort of interacting with other things, other things.

641
01:08:02,820 --> 01:08:09,959
And then this context example in terms of how context shapes your functioning is that idea of like, you know, you may need, for example,

642
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:13,290
after school activities or after school care and you may want to do those,

643
01:08:13,290 --> 01:08:19,050
but they've also got to like meet your family's care needs so that can kind of shape the opportunities that you have going forward.

644
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:23,639
So like if you're lucky enough to have like an after school program with activities that

645
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:28,230
you like and enjoy and help are enriching and help you grow exposed to new things,

646
01:08:28,230 --> 01:08:30,990
that's great. But kind of not all families do.

647
01:08:30,990 --> 01:08:39,420
So I would say like that after school and people talk about OCD interventions which are like out of school time interventions often after school,

648
01:08:39,420 --> 01:08:46,559
but sometimes also before school in the summer. Those are all really important times to think about for interventions with this group

649
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:51,390
because they're just not in school for as long as like the early childhood time,

650
01:08:51,630 --> 01:08:55,980
right. So kindergarten ends more at 3 p.m., sort of 5 p.m.

651
01:08:55,980 --> 01:09:03,660
So those two key hours where there's opportunity for intervention programing in different domains,

652
01:09:05,550 --> 01:09:11,250
a little more about schooling and again, lots of COVID stuff going on.

653
01:09:11,820 --> 01:09:19,559
But key things here to know about this age group is that this is when a lot of things start emerging because of being

654
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:24,959
in the school context and because of being in a big room with kids trying to look at things from the back of the room,

655
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:28,350
a lot of like vision problems that come to light.

656
01:09:28,350 --> 01:09:31,800
Also, there's vision screening in schools, there's hearing screening in schools.

657
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:37,660
And so this is a common time for lots of different conditions to become a parent, too.

658
01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:46,680
So I put this up there. This is like a big thing also in educational psychology, again, some literature, a lot of literature to support this.

659
01:09:46,680 --> 01:09:50,190
I would say it's not set in stone. I would say it's not fixed.

660
01:09:50,550 --> 01:09:57,210
But this idea of like having a fixed mindset versus an incremental mindset, if you guys have heard this phrase of like,

661
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:02,340
I can't do it yet, it's like a big thing in schools and education settings.

662
01:10:03,030 --> 01:10:10,379
So that's this idea. So like you have a fixed mindset believing like I am good at math and I can do math and I that

663
01:10:10,380 --> 01:10:15,360
is like my fixed amount of math ability that I have versus if you have an incremental mindset,

664
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:19,739
it's more like I can learn how to do math. I'm a learner, I can learn in the domain of math.

665
01:10:19,740 --> 01:10:23,760
Like those would be really different for eventually achieving in math.

666
01:10:24,900 --> 01:10:31,260
And Carol Dweck is the person who's like associated with those. So people are interested in, in sort of achievement questions.

667
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:35,220
I'm not sure of anybody's papers on that, but I'd like to just put that up so that you guys know about the.

668
01:10:36,160 --> 01:10:48,209
Another thing and again, I think we see this a lot now already in COVID, but like the motivational factors are going to be going to be present.

669
01:10:48,210 --> 01:10:54,390
And I think very and I think we certainly see by the end of high school that motivation may dwindle for school.

670
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:59,280
Hence another reason to have all those external other extracurricular activities.

671
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:02,280
Yeah, I just mentioned something that I think is really interesting too,

672
01:11:02,280 --> 01:11:08,009
is how parents talk to kids about school and like how that shapes their views.

673
01:11:08,010 --> 01:11:14,670
Like this is how you get a good grade. It's like all based around your grades versus like, yes, you work hard, you know?

674
01:11:14,730 --> 01:11:20,090
Yes, yes, absolutely. And so like you, you've got an A and it's like very, you know,

675
01:11:20,100 --> 01:11:24,719
external and like that's the value of it versus like, what did you learn today in school?

676
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:29,520
So we talk. Yeah, absolutely. Like how how parents engage with schooling and learning.

677
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:33,420
And that can definitely make a difference for our kids.

678
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:40,260
We haven't even talked about chores. I don't think it came up. It often comes up and like I'm talking about today, but like chores, right?

679
01:11:40,260 --> 01:11:43,889
Like do you pay your kids to do chores or is it like an expectation of being part

680
01:11:43,890 --> 01:11:48,150
of this family that you do chores that like how do chores change over time?

681
01:11:48,150 --> 01:11:53,610
Like what chores are appropriate, you know, starting in early childhood, going through,

682
01:11:53,700 --> 01:11:58,859
you know, can they get I would argue they should get bigger as kids get bigger.

683
01:11:58,860 --> 01:12:00,179
Right, and have more responsibilities.

684
01:12:00,180 --> 01:12:07,290
But then kids also have competing responsibilities like I have band practice, so I couldn't whatever take out the trash or something like that.

685
01:12:07,620 --> 01:12:13,140
So just sort of teaching kids to, to engage with chores at this age is also important.

686
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:17,850
It's funny because I feel like that usually comes up in the discussion. I realize it didn't this time.

687
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:26,070
We've talked a little bit about friendships, bullying and their reputations, which and conformity to peers, right?

688
01:12:26,070 --> 01:12:29,830
So like kids who are in that sort of junior high,

689
01:12:29,830 --> 01:12:37,440
if those of us can remember middle school to early high school is like peak peak peak conformity time.

690
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:45,959
So like if you talk to thinking about my ninth grader like anything that like deviates from what the peers are doing is like a nonstarter.

691
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:52,080
Like can't not wear shorts even if it's 40 degrees because everybody else is wearing shorts, for example.

692
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:58,770
So that like conformity and it does fade by the end of high school in part because like the kids develop different interests

693
01:12:58,770 --> 01:13:04,290
hopefully and find things that they like to do that like line up with those kind of like different intelligences or whatever.

694
01:13:04,890 --> 01:13:11,969
But it really is that sort of like junior high, ninth grade, early high school kind of era where you're like super conformity.

695
01:13:11,970 --> 01:13:15,840
And so if you have early puberty and you're not conforming to your peers,

696
01:13:16,050 --> 01:13:20,280
that's going to kind of bring on maybe extra stress or and we're talking about early puberty.

697
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:22,860
Often we're talking about girls, but for boys, it's often late.

698
01:13:23,550 --> 01:13:31,710
Like if you're like a boy who hasn't hit their growth spurt yet, that sort of a sense of like lack of conformity that can be stressful.

699
01:13:32,850 --> 01:13:33,120
Um,

700
01:13:33,570 --> 01:13:41,310
and then the other thing that I think came up a bit in the Jackie Uncle's article is this idea of like school environment or child environment fit.

701
01:13:41,910 --> 01:13:45,420
And so school settings really change over this course of time, right?

702
01:13:45,420 --> 01:13:52,709
So like we didn't think about in grade school, kids are like in one classroom, one teacher, maybe a few teachers.

703
01:13:52,710 --> 01:13:56,670
They have like a little special, you know, if they have music, maybe that's a different teacher, for example.

704
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:05,159
But as you get into, you know, middle school, you're sort of usually in bigger school settings and maybe in personal, you know, your teachers as well.

705
01:14:05,160 --> 01:14:14,940
And so how well that school setting fits you as an individual child is a big predictor of how you do, how you engage with school,

706
01:14:14,940 --> 01:14:21,840
whether you're an incremental growth mindset learner, whether internally or intrinsically motivated.

707
01:14:23,430 --> 01:14:27,240
So what's of this school fit is a big issue.

708
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:37,830
The other thing I'll say is that parent involvement becomes just a little more takes more demand from parents because it's not as straightforward,

709
01:14:37,830 --> 01:14:40,560
both like the work. So I was just mentioning math.

710
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:49,590
Parents might not have felt confident to, you know, help their child in after uncovered after like fourth grade or even second grade.

711
01:14:50,670 --> 01:14:56,250
Reading might be a little bit easier, but these are things that become more challenging for families over time.

712
01:14:57,630 --> 01:15:01,920
But we also know that parent involvement in schooling is really critical.

713
01:15:01,980 --> 01:15:09,270
So it's the sort of additional like challenge constraints of the schooling settings for parents and kids.

714
01:15:10,580 --> 01:15:15,540
And I'll just I'll go through just to more quickly, we've talked a bit about gender.

715
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:20,610
I love these pictures because it just sort of shows like across eras,

716
01:15:20,610 --> 01:15:25,769
these same sort of gender differences between boys and girls kind of play out similarly.

717
01:15:25,770 --> 01:15:30,540
So here I mentioned, like the starting sixth grader and like the ending female eighth grader.

718
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:39,960
That's a big height difference if you think about things like. Perhaps dating each other like here, that big height difference is still there.

719
01:15:40,950 --> 01:15:48,179
And that the other thing to note here is like, again, we know age, chronological age is an imperfect marker,

720
01:15:48,180 --> 01:15:54,980
but these are sort of the ages at which standard puberty happens.

721
01:15:54,990 --> 01:15:58,260
So for girls, it was really earlier. For boys, it's a little bit later.

722
01:15:58,860 --> 01:16:00,450
We talked about social changes.

723
01:16:01,260 --> 01:16:08,669
We talked a little bit even about cultural attitudes around what that means, these pubertal changes, because it can vary by family, right?

724
01:16:08,670 --> 01:16:13,650
And we're thinking about kids who've been in their nuclear family with no peers throughout covert.

725
01:16:14,670 --> 01:16:20,250
This may be really different, sort of qualitatively different from how it even was before.

726
01:16:21,240 --> 01:16:27,960
The other thing this what this is, is that these risky and healthy behaviors kind of align by gender.

727
01:16:29,130 --> 01:16:42,750
And so what we see most typically social media use really more problematic among females risk taking, more risk behaviors among boys.

728
01:16:42,750 --> 01:16:48,149
And then academic achievement is used to be more problematic in girls.

729
01:16:48,150 --> 01:16:49,530
Now it's more problematic in boys.

730
01:16:49,530 --> 01:16:56,850
So the decrease is just in interesting internal interactions between gender and like what kind of risky behavior you're having.

731
01:16:58,260 --> 01:17:03,180
So we'll talk more about those. And again, a lot of people are doing some of those for their papers.

732
01:17:04,860 --> 01:17:09,600
And I wanted to just end by saying I'm thinking about the family here,

733
01:17:10,950 --> 01:17:18,359
because I think it's really critical to remember that families can really help in supporting child autonomy across the stage,

734
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:21,930
but the child is rapidly changing. So it's that kind of constant.

735
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:26,490
Remember, we talked about toddlers like being able to do more and more things.

736
01:17:26,790 --> 01:17:32,279
It's the same thing here. But the changes are sort of more internal, right, in terms of the child.

737
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:36,689
But the child's thinking about how they're coping with emotions, what pubertal changes they're doing,

738
01:17:36,690 --> 01:17:43,710
because parents might not always be aware of that, especially if thinking of like, you know, a female parent with a male child.

739
01:17:44,550 --> 01:17:50,310
This can be a time when, like, the male child is like not having any interaction with the female parent unclothed.

740
01:17:50,670 --> 01:17:52,380
And it sounds horrible, but like, you know what I mean?

741
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:59,100
So how do parents figure out how to offer autonomy to their kids and how do they do it in a way that's,

742
01:17:59,290 --> 01:18:03,000
you know, managing to manage, manage in the family context.

743
01:18:03,300 --> 01:18:12,120
That's the changing state of the child. And I think that this phrase of like trust but verify, we can talk more about this next week, too.

744
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:20,219
But the whole question of like how to monitor kids certainly has changed in the digital age,

745
01:18:20,220 --> 01:18:28,440
both in terms of a context that one needs to think about monitoring and of course, tools for monitoring.

746
01:18:28,530 --> 01:18:32,519
Right. Are available in a way that they weren't before digital media.

747
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:39,239
And so I think you guys are probably on edge where you had like some digital media stuff happening as kids.

748
01:18:39,240 --> 01:18:46,950
So just like reflect on that and then these are just sort of things to think about.

749
01:18:46,950 --> 01:18:49,529
But the get to know peer group and engage the village,

750
01:18:49,530 --> 01:18:56,460
those are both things that I think are very important for parents of older kids to be able to do.

751
01:18:56,670 --> 01:19:02,490
And again, in COVID, that has been an extra challenge because unless you were like in a pod,

752
01:19:02,580 --> 01:19:05,700
like a learning pod with people, you may not have known any peers.

753
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:12,360
And then if your child emerges into like, you know, a school context where you aren't exposed to that child's periods,

754
01:19:12,360 --> 01:19:21,000
it's going to be really hard for the parent to kind of figure out who those peers are and to engage their village in terms of child,

755
01:19:21,750 --> 01:19:23,310
you know, monitoring and management.

756
01:19:24,540 --> 01:19:34,110
So okay, so I know we're at time, but next time we will talk more about like screen stuff and other things and we will also watch a video.

757
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:38,250
I just want to give a heads up that has kids playing with firearms.

758
01:19:38,670 --> 01:19:54,900
So it's a really great video, but just sort of like why I it like to watch the big guys out there.
