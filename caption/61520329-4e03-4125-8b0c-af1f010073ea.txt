1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,650
Reminder that, you know, we're getting into, I guess, close to midterms.

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:08,340
Is that right? Like a loss of the midterms?

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:14,700
No. Just to realize that, you know, this can be a stressful time, so be nice to yourself to see each other.

4
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:25,980
I know you probably are anyway, but you know, sometimes when you get caught up in the middle of the semester, things start to get a little hectic.

5
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,670
So, yeah, just remember to be kind.

6
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:33,870
It's always a good thing. Oh, my gosh.

7
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:37,290
Too many buttons to push. Hi. Hi.

8
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:41,700
No announcements, so we're gonna do something a little bit different today.

9
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:48,720
It's not always fun to do things different. So we're going to be kind of on this one.

10
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,810
We're going to finish up the critical Kansas public health applications,

11
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:02,760
and then we're going to go into the groups for the critical reflection circles.

12
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:09,809
But what I'm going to do is we're going to start those earlier and then we're going to come back to the class after the groups,

13
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:16,650
because what you'll be doing in your group is you'll actually be applying critical conscious techniques,

14
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:23,250
either coaching or some form of critical pedagogy to a public health intervention.

15
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:29,820
And, you know, the application of these principles is often the hardest.

16
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:36,180
Again, in a lot of classes, you just have to memorize, regurgitate or, you know, just say what someone else said.

17
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:43,170
But having to really think through the whole process of creation and application can be a lot more difficult.

18
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:55,769
So what we're going to do is you'll be in your groups for about 20 minutes and then you'll come back and we'll have the groups do some report back.

19
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:59,160
We're not going to have it super formal, but I want to talk both about process.

20
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:03,920
But that process was like for you, but then also the content, what you can do, right?

21
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:07,950
Any questions about that over that doesn't increase your anxiety level.

22
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:14,310
So anyone remember anything about these images and why these images are up here?

23
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:24,450
Come on. If one person was paying attention to me. Yes.

24
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:31,910
I'm sorry. That's okay. But I remember we were talking about, you know, upper class.

25
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:37,140
So I was I was in the upper left corner.

26
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:45,840
The two photos of the resupplies, yourself one and the head of the person is holding.

27
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:54,600
And just the expression and the hair versus the shaved hair on the person in the main photo was, quote unquote, civilized.

28
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:55,380
Mm hmm.

29
00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:05,670
And just I can't believe that ad was put out there, reviewed by a marketing team and several people, and they thought that was a good idea, right?

30
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:10,030
Yeah. And what was. So let's take a step back. What was this all about?

31
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:19,440
What's the concept or what's the idea? What is this doing? You know, why were we engaging people to look at this and analyze?

32
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:22,700
Yeah,

33
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:38,590
I guess I just like thinking about representation and how is either lack of information or or the groups represented in ads such as these and like.

34
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:47,750
Kind of instilling certain things like internalizing the internal racism, I guess, for internalized oppression.

35
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:53,120
Yeah. Yeah. In the broader community like that could affect people, but then also like how other people.

36
00:03:53,900 --> 00:04:05,060
Right. And I want to remind folks about laptops. So you need to put those down unless you have limitations to seeing the slides or things like that.

37
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:11,899
What else what is the underlying concept here that we're talking about that's

38
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:21,350
been that this is this whole slides so this about talking about more and also.

39
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:30,190
You honestly were among those that would put those lines back.

40
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:34,000
A couples, in your words. What are we talking about here?

41
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:38,320
Yeah. Subconscious. Exactly. That's all I wanted.

42
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:45,459
Were you guys all looking for, like, some deeper meaning or something? I was straightforward.

43
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:49,210
Blond guys. So critical consciousness. That's what we're talking about, right?

44
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:56,290
So how do the how does analyzing these photos help with critical consciousness?

45
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:03,940
So you said something, Abigail, in terms of talking about like the way that people are misrepresented.

46
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:09,370
But but how else does this help to increase critical consciousness?

47
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:14,940
Eleanor, thank you for sitting in the same place. I love that.

48
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:18,430
I feel like like in this case,

49
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:26,050
like being critically conscious can help you like break the stigma that's already around this are like Great Depression,

50
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:31,150
but the patterns of oppression that people face and like when looking at things like this,

51
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:39,670
you can see why there are systemic there's built in things to society, such as haircuts and other things that represent civility,

52
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:43,630
which I think critical consciousness can help combat those stereotypes.

53
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:49,500
Okay. And how does how does oppression work?

54
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:53,230
Like, what's the first foundational thing that needs to happen in order to break oppression?

55
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,980
What do you first need? What needs to be activated?

56
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,530
Yeah. Is there lines that you are oppressed? Exactly.

57
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:01,660
Realize that you are oppressed.

58
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:10,719
So again, the way that oppression keeps people down, the way that oppression keeps people unhealthy is that in a lot of situations,

59
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,850
you don't even realize the world could be different. You know,

60
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:18,730
you don't realize that there's another way and you often don't even realize you're being oppressed because you just like that's the way it is,

61
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:24,610
you know? And those messages can get perpetuated and passed on.

62
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:28,710
Generation to generation. Community to community. All right.

63
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:34,390
Um, so ask another question, or are you all like, Oh, my God, he's going to ask another question?

64
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:40,500
Anyone else remember anything even basic about us talking about these lines?

65
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:45,399
And again, I'm looking for deeper meaning that. So in terms of recognizing that you're oppressed,

66
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:51,270
I remember I was talking about the lyrics on that and it's just like a really cool Eminem song, right?

67
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:56,110
You don't know what these words mean, but you're actually saying some God awful things are getting a lot of good.

68
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:03,580
Exactly. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. So here's I used to play the YouTube, but I can't even I can't hear it anymore.

69
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:14,110
So, you know, here's the words. I mean, but, you know, the criminal was a very, very popular song, you know, and played everywhere.

70
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:21,040
And I don't know how many people realized the actual things that he was saying, you know, because people are gonna, like,

71
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:25,960
bop in their head and listen and and again, those that's a way in which now,

72
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:31,750
you know, I don't know if Eminem sat down and said, I want to oppress gay people.

73
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:37,600
And so, you know, let me put this into my lyrics and then get it, you know, in people's heads.

74
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:49,120
But part of being in a privileged position can lead people to do that without thinking about that because they don't have to.

75
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:57,100
Right. Because he's got the privilege. He's got white, male, cis, straight now, higher income privilege.

76
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:03,070
So he doesn't have to think about how these words can be damaging to folks.

77
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:13,840
So, you know, it is one of those things and I read again, that's part of what, you know, I'd like everyone to try and do in this class a semester.

78
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,219
That's why we do the journal is really to start critically analyzing all the

79
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:23,290
bombardment of messages that you receive all the time that you don't even think about,

80
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:33,130
you know, or look in your classrooms. And how many people of different identities are in front of the classroom,

81
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:39,430
or how many people who are in other positions of power and privilege have shared identities with you?

82
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,950
Again, these are all messaging.

83
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:51,960
So if you're a kid growing up and your grade school and you never see a teacher that looks like you, that is a very strong message.

84
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:58,930
You know, someone didn't sit there and say, oh, you're black, you can't be a teacher, but every single teacher is white.

85
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:03,460
Then you're sending that message in an indirect way.

86
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:08,740
And those messages are harder to undo, you know, because if people that are parents,

87
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:15,490
you know, you can't do that because you're a woman, you probably get defensive.

88
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:19,180
That would be like, Well, I'll show you, I can do this and things like that.

89
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:23,650
But if you send that message through social messaging.

90
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:29,960
Without directly saying it, that gets ingrained into our thought patterns much, much, much more easily.

91
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:33,690
And it's a lot harder to break down what makes sense.

92
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,880
And to ask another question, just sit here and stare at you all that.

93
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:41,420
It's kind of fun. Not really. It was really stressful for me too.

94
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:44,870
I was like that. I really like f up and that's all right.

95
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:48,470
So I think we did it. Oh, so.

96
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:55,939
So this was and I started a show, I showed one of these slides before, but just to give you a little bit more background,

97
00:09:55,940 --> 00:10:03,739
so this was an intervention I mentioned before that gluten free was a name that was created and I wasn't thrilled with,

98
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:10,070
but the guys really liked it and their intervention. So these are just so I knew some of the materials too,

99
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:18,470
and we were very thoughtful and the team was very thoughtful in thinking about what images to put.

100
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:22,370
So I talked about how they wanted this to be like a superhero image.

101
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:33,020
But with this, we spent a lot of time looking at lots of pictures to make sure that there were young men of different skin tones,

102
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:38,419
different body shapes, different hair textures, all different types of things.

103
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:44,750
Because one thing that we talked a lot about and we'll show on a little bit and someone mentioned this in class the other day,

104
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:54,860
which is about oppression within in a group that's minoritized and people, you know, privileging or oppressing people within that.

105
00:10:54,860 --> 00:11:03,470
So, you know, we spent a lot of time to find all these pictures so that the guys felt like they were all represented.

106
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:09,260
This was our Youth Action Board. So these young men worked with us for three years.

107
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:15,889
Really cool thing. I keep in touch with a lot of the guys still.

108
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:16,670
And this was.

109
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:31,080
But 12, 15 years ago, you know that the cool thing, too, is that when when our team does research projects and we work with youth in any kind of way,

110
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:36,420
we do separate professional development with each one of them.

111
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:39,810
So we create individualized development plans.

112
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:43,170
So it has nothing to do with the research. It's all about them.

113
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:48,390
So we help them get into school. If they want to get in the school, we help them get jobs, things like that.

114
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:53,580
One of our guys was when he started the study was was actually homeless.

115
00:11:53,940 --> 00:12:03,000
And by the end of the study, he was a political science major at Chicago State University and had stable housing and a job, things like that.

116
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:13,950
One of our other guys went and got his master's in child development, and I saw him actually this summer.

117
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:21,209
Now he's in L.A. and he wants to be an actor because he was working in the during the pandemic.

118
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:30,720
He was working in D.C. in low income schools, bilingual schools, and as a darker skinned black man,

119
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:36,100
he had also experienced a lot of violence in the past three years.

120
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:43,350
And so and to the funding in D.C. for schools is [INAUDIBLE].

121
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:48,870
So he was like, no, I'm tired of this. I've already, you know, I've done my my service to society.

122
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:54,030
I want to be an actor. So when it becomes famous, then I knew him.

123
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:59,310
One of the other guys is also in L.A. and he's now the director of a nonprofit.

124
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:12,720
Another guy is in New York and now is a musician and has a couple of CDs albums, I don't know, tracks, music set.

125
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:14,910
So anyway,

126
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:24,419
I think it's really important when we're working with people who are from different minoritized or disadvantaged communities as far as researchers,

127
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:29,570
as practitioners, whatever we want to call ourselves, if we're going to engage with communities,

128
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:37,170
we have to be there for more than just the project or the program because these are people's lives.

129
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:49,350
Some of the intervention activities we came up with where this is one of our black gay historical figures,

130
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:58,180
how many people know who all these people are? See if they were all white.

131
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:10,930
We would know all of them. So, John, I mean, she is the first was the first NBA player who came out as gay after he left, of course, the NBA.

132
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:27,910
Alvin Ailey, quite a brilliant choreographer. Bill Wilson is kind of AIDS, HIV, but then also black gay men's activist Marlon Riggs.

133
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:40,060
Anyone know who Marlon Wayans is? Hopefully someone. So Marlon is also an author and a playwright.

134
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:46,100
I mean, this did amazing, amazing stuff. Now, how many people know who Bayard Rustin is?

135
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:54,410
Okay. This is a failure of the U.S. educational system.

136
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:59,040
Oh, so it's not your fault. It's the educators fault.

137
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:07,950
Bayard Rustin was Martin Luther King's right hand man and he actually wrote the speech for the March on Washington.

138
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:16,110
He was gay, but could not be out during that time, especially with the large visibility.

139
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:25,380
He was extremely, extremely powerful and engaged in the civil rights movement in this country.

140
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:30,420
But because he was gay, most people don't know anything about it.

141
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:37,260
You know, you want to hear anything more about them. I think that's the extent to which I know.

142
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:40,920
But yeah, he was like super involved in the civil rights movement.

143
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:46,290
And he. Did he ever come out as gay while he was alive or not?

144
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:53,790
Was it just not? Yeah, it was. Well, he came out with some quotes, but it was it was a very small circle of people.

145
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:59,820
But yeah, then afterwards, a lot more people knew. Now I know most people know who RuPaul is.

146
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:06,600
Now, one thing that of all these people. Which person do you think most people know?

147
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:14,579
RuPaul. Now, look at the list of people and look at the person people know.

148
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:23,260
What's wrong with that? What's wrong with this picture? Thinking.

149
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:27,550
Oh, no, I'm sorry. It's Anna. Anna?

150
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:35,020
I know. Sorry. My brain is really down to this. Yeah, I was just, like, knowing all of this, like,

151
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:48,350
is kind of perpetuating the stereotype of the LGBTQ community that recognized RuPaul as this figure and is like the number one in most people's minds.

152
00:16:48,370 --> 00:17:02,020
It just kind of ruined all these other sort of figures of the country like America and also just just we've done as a society.

153
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:05,620
Right. Exactly. Any other thoughts on that? Why?

154
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:08,139
This is kind of to me,

155
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:21,490
kind of said it's like a big part of what it does is it also says that the only way that black gay men can have power is if they become a character.

156
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:36,129
Right. So he has to become a drag queen in order to be accepted by US society and to be, you know, he's got a show that's very outrageous.

157
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:39,220
And I mean, everything is kind of like over the top, right?

158
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:46,210
It's comedy, it's music, it's entertainment. So we only accept certain people as entertainment.

159
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:55,570
We don't accept them as star athletes, you know, activists, political leaders in the civil rights movement.

160
00:17:57,010 --> 00:18:05,110
So one thing that we do in this intervention is we have an activity where they learn about gay historical figures.

161
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:09,820
Now, one thing that was really interesting when we first put the program together,

162
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:14,500
when we did our pilot testing, this activity was like 15 minutes long.

163
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:18,250
And all the guys were like, No, it needs to be twice as long.

164
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:26,050
And we're like, Come on, you know, you want to talk about history and like, this is the first time we've ever seen ourselves in a history book.

165
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:36,100
So we want more and more and more. And again, if you think back to one of the the most negative forms of oppression is invisibility.

166
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:44,830
Okay. This is a prime example how the lives and accomplishments of black gay men are completely invisible.

167
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:50,770
Do you know of any other famous, popular, well known black gay man?

168
00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:00,810
Michael K Williams. Okay. And what has he done? He's an actor.

169
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:11,070
And he played a very important role on a TV show called The Wire, which represented the urban population of Baltimore.

170
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:20,259
And he played an individual who was gay and someone who many people where if he was in this position, they wouldn't expect him to be gay.

171
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:26,700
And it was a very like monumental role within popular culture because it kind of shed light on.

172
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:32,820
Black homosexual. Actually, he passed away on July three.

173
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:40,680
Right now. A year ago? Yeah. Who else? As anyone's ever watched the show Queer Eye.

174
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:44,370
That's one of the top five drama of the social worker.

175
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:49,649
Openly gay. Okay, you want to get in?

176
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:53,520
Both of those are what? Field entertainment?

177
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,820
Yeah. Yeah. Another entertainer. Billy Porter. Yeah.

178
00:19:56,850 --> 00:20:04,440
Oh, my goodness. Phenomenal. I'm so mad. But it was about the ballroom culture and his work in the eighties.

179
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,650
The HIV AIDS epidemic.

180
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:14,190
Yeah, I still. I still haven't watched the very last episode because I can't let go of it.

181
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:22,640
So I was like, Yeah, my husband, he's like, just watch the, you know, like, no, because and I have to admit that it's gone straight forward.

182
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:27,620
James Bone Excellent. Can you tell folks who he was a writer.

183
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:31,630
Right. So that is one man, not entertainer.

184
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:36,300
Yeah, I have another entertainer, but Frank Ocean, I believe is by.

185
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:41,339
Yeah, exactly. Yeah. So again, I mean, all of this just perpetuates that.

186
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:46,710
Again, that idea, except for James Baldwin about people who are, you know, entertainers.

187
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:52,260
I was going to say there was a football player who came out when he was in college.

188
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:57,870
His name was Michael Sam. Yeah. And he got a lot of backlash and ended up his football career,

189
00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:03,150
ended up kind of failing due to a lot of reasons, partially because of his mental health and.

190
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:11,670
Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Because he he made it to the pro was Ryan was drafted, but I don't think he ever actually played in the game.

191
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:14,850
Exactly. Yeah. He was from the University of Missouri. Columbia.

192
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:23,940
Yeah. And and there was a ton of stress that he went through to be out and just a lot of a lot of backlash.

193
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:32,910
Another one in semi entertainment. But Don Lemon has been, you know, openly gay for quite some time.

194
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:40,430
He actually used to when I lived in Chicago, he was a newscaster there and wasn't out.

195
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:44,610
He didn't come out until much later. And then he wrote a book actually about that whole process.

196
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:56,520
So anyway, so this is one aspect of the broader critical consciousness, too, is realizing that your history is invisible,

197
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:03,149
realizing that there are people like you who have done and continue to do amazing things.

198
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:11,190
So that was one activity. This was an activity that the guys created and they had a lot of fun with.

199
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:18,029
And this is where in the development process we were talking a lot about the whole

200
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:23,160
process of people within them and after Minoritized group discriminated against others.

201
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:32,939
And so they we had a lot of conversations about the the ways in which young black gay

202
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:40,020
men discriminated against other black gay men or make assumptions based on skin color,

203
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:44,130
body type, hair texture, size, shape, all these other things.

204
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:48,450
And so what they so they selected all these pictures.

205
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:55,920
And then for each guy, we showed the picture and the name on the sheet.

206
00:22:57,370 --> 00:23:01,090
Marked where they were on this line in terms of a descriptive.

207
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:11,260
And again, all of our work is very blunt so we don't beat around the bush and, you know, use words like penis.

208
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:17,860
We might use chalk because that's why, you know, they may be saying or dick or you have penis.

209
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:27,129
I've tried to said that. So they go through and you probably can't read, but like the first is a top or bottom.

210
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:34,810
So that has to do with sexual positioning people to partner promiscuous a few partners in his life a lot of

211
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:43,570
sex partners kinky freaky vanilla not sexually adventurous uses condoms all the time not is clean of STIs.

212
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:47,230
HIV has a lot of sex has sex with man.

213
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:50,590
He would be my buddy. He would be my hubby.

214
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:57,969
So that's my favorite one. And I did a presentation where they made me believe this out.

215
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:06,820
I was so pissed, but I said [INAUDIBLE] really loud in the presentation so people could hear it was stupid.

216
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:16,130
And it it's like you can't present this in the conference without word. I felt like I you away but god is great.

217
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:21,459
I know that was really bad, but the guys created this and then after they did that,

218
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:27,700
they had a discussion about ways in which people within the community may be

219
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:31,930
further discriminating and what that means and what those assumptions mean.

220
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:40,590
And again, trying to get people to think about those automatic messages that just pop in your head based on the messaging that you've gotten.

221
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:53,230
So that was the primary prevention. We also did another study with folks at Columbia University,

222
00:24:54,070 --> 00:25:01,330
and we worked and it was through a network of researchers called the Adolescent Trials Network for HIV AIDS Interventions.

223
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:10,830
And we worked in four different cities. And so we had it was a random community randomized trial.

224
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:18,310
So two communities we did this intervention, two we did this one is called Move Mobilizing our Voices for Empowerment.

225
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:27,310
Again, this is we had a group of young men in New York and a group in Chicago who were our co developers.

226
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:30,220
So again, that's the name they came up with.

227
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:37,690
Now, one thing that we did a little bit different with this, because of all the privacy issues around living with HIV,

228
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:47,979
everything was online and it was in a secure location at Columbia University and encrypted and all that stuff, which I don't probably understand.

229
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:51,070
But yeah, they told me it was really, really secure.

230
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:59,950
That's why I was at the Columbia site. So when we had our intervention sessions, they could get the materials here.

231
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:06,730
Also, if they had, we had a discussion forum, so they had questions after the group sessions,

232
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:12,050
they could type that in and ask us any questions that we wanted.

233
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:15,759
And both of the interventions are the one in Chicago.

234
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:25,149
And here, the way that we set it up was that the the young men met for two days in a row.

235
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:30,850
So some it was a Friday, Saturday, some it was a Saturday, Sunday, some group was a monday Tuesday.

236
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:34,479
And they were with us for 6 hours.

237
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,660
So it was kind of like a retreat in a way. We fed them.

238
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:41,830
We did transportation. They got paid well for for being there.

239
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:53,350
And the idea behind having that intensity of those two sessions is like we talked about before, these messages are so ingrained.

240
00:26:53,590 --> 00:27:01,510
Then similar to like we were talking about popular education, you need more time to really try and undo some of this stuff.

241
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:06,220
So they would have. So we would have those two sessions back to back.

242
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:13,000
Then they would come back a month later after they've had time to practice some of the skills.

243
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:21,720
And so during that time, we would spend time processing what happened, you know,

244
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:29,920
seeing how it worked in terms of thinking about their own risk behaviors and their health protective behaviors.

245
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:33,400
And then we added some more little bit more content.

246
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:45,670
Then we saw them a month later. So we wanted this process of like access and reflection and action reflection to make sure that they were, you know,

247
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:50,530
we weren't just giving them the intervention and saying, go out in the world and, you know, change your life.

248
00:27:50,890 --> 00:27:59,620
But they would come back and they were then engaged in more interactive activities and games that I mean, too.

249
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:06,940
It was a lot of fun. You know, so like the pictures of the different guys and stuff, you know, of course, everyone, you don't have a laugh about the,

250
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:13,090
you know, the last one and and just the all the activities were were designed to be a lot of fun.

251
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:20,980
But having those multiple times where we all came together was really critical to help

252
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:26,800
embed these things in their thinking and the way that they're moving through the world.

253
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:36,160
Because, again, you know, if you think about someone's a team that's 18 years of really [INAUDIBLE] programing that society has pumped in their head,

254
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:39,520
we can't just say, okay, after a two hour session, you're going to change.

255
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:44,260
So that's why we would have them for, you know, 12 hours across the two days.

256
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:50,380
And then they would have, I think it was 3 hours a month later and then 3 hours a month after that.

257
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:58,000
So here's another with this intervention.

258
00:28:58,210 --> 00:29:02,140
This was another one of the stimulus materials that we were used.

259
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,680
So has anyone ever seen this picture before?

260
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:09,750
You know who these people are. Who are they?

261
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:15,370
I just love it. After the hour and everyone's like, Yeah, I mean, no one wants to sit here.

262
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:20,620
They're saying, you are from James is a basketball player, and then that's a model.

263
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:26,740
I'm not her last name. Exactly. It sounds like, you know, she's kind of you only need one, right?

264
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:36,550
So this so LeBron James was only the second man to appear on Vogue.

265
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:45,730
The first was George Clooney. And so he was the second the first man of color to ever appear on Vogue magazine.

266
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,900
This was done by Annie Liebowitz.

267
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:58,180
So a very famous photographer photographed a lot of very famous people.

268
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:11,530
Now, here's the scary thing when you look at this is an advertisement for King Kong.

269
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:17,770
Destroy this mad brute, always an advertisment.

270
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:23,990
It was it was to get people to enlist in the armies, destroy this mad brute.

271
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:32,890
And the large character is meant to be a German and the damsel in distress.

272
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:37,000
Yeah. So do you notice similarities between these two?

273
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:41,150
What do you see?

274
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:53,520
On the composition of the photograph, the way that, like LeBron kind of has his arm around her, like is really mimicking the same way that Ling,

275
00:30:53,780 --> 00:31:01,460
the big gorilla, is like holding the woman like just like the pose they give, the way that they're, like, standing, right?

276
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:07,640
Yeah. Josh, Bron and King Kong have, like, the same expression on their face.

277
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:11,040
Exactly. And LeBron is also wearing, like, all dark colors.

278
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:15,500
Yeah. What else? Yes, sir.

279
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:19,460
I don't want to go as far as saying like a weapon, but the basketball is about like it's big.

280
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:22,730
Just that object imminently close to the hand. Right.

281
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,920
And do you think this is an accident?

282
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:37,250
I mean, when you see them side by side, you know, if it were just somewhat similar, you could say, oh, we have a rumor.

283
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:43,739
But the fact that the you know, everything I mean, her dress is almost exactly the same.

284
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:50,070
Her hair is almost exactly the same. You know, like like you said, Josh, LeBron is an all black.

285
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:54,450
Right. When George Clooney was on the cover, he was in a nice suit.

286
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:56,160
But we have a black man,

287
00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:06,090
so we have to make him an athlete and we have to dress up in all black to almost erase his skin and create this kind of all blacks finger.

288
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:11,520
Yet, and like of all of LeBron's teams he's been on, like his jersey has never been that color.

289
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:21,090
Right. Exactly. Exactly. So if you truly wanted to represent him as a basketball player, you would give a jersey of, you know, one of the things.

290
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:21,770
That's a good point.

291
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:28,440
He thought about that before you have again, I think that it's interesting that, like, he looks like he didn't get the full coverage himself.

292
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:32,930
Yeah, I feel like a lot of covers. It's just like one person. Yeah, that's.

293
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:43,530
Yeah, exactly. And if you look at to when you look at the juxtaposition of this dark figure and then the blond white woman and the lighter color,

294
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:46,980
she even though she's smaller, she still overtakes the picture.

295
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:51,690
In a lot of ways. She's more of a central focal picture.

296
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:53,790
Yeah, this could be a reach.

297
00:32:53,790 --> 00:33:02,760
But even like with intense, like, her neck, the model's name is first in like even when the description the world's top models and start.

298
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:08,860
Because it is interesting. And those are not mistakes.

299
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:13,750
You know, and again, that's what critical competence is about, is about looking at these things.

300
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:20,889
Because when you see that message, Jane, you know, again, the woman in first, her role is first.

301
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:29,380
I mean, you know, some people say, oh, you're being picky. But when you look at 100 ads and you see it in 75 out of 100, you know, something's up.

302
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:34,060
Yeah, yeah. Like you have the colors again. It's always like there's a spotlight on her.

303
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,600
Yeah, everything else. Background. Exactly. Yeah, yeah.

304
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:45,310
Because, like, in here, you can't really even see much of, like, the differentiation of his shirt and shorts because it's also darkened.

305
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:55,000
Yeah. To add on to that, even like the background color of the entire magazine kind of washes out his skin color and his clothes and then brings out.

306
00:33:55,120 --> 00:34:03,340
Yeah, definitely. Yeah. It's really interesting because I like when OJ Simpson and that's like a long time ago for

307
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:09,880
for most of you about when the whole O.J. Simpson trial and other things were were going on.

308
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:22,090
Several people looked at his pictures in magazines and his skin was darkened in the magazines to equate dark with bad.

309
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:26,350
And there's like there's been like studies of it and all this other kind of crazy [INAUDIBLE].

310
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:28,950
I know there are a bunch of hands here and then up there again.

311
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:36,070
Oh, I just saw like, for example, in like where they're, they have like words of like descriptions and stuff like that.

312
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:41,529
Beside it's like closer to like just now it's like it's not covering her like the kind of,

313
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:44,650
like it was like their way to make sure that they don't cover any part of her.

314
00:34:44,890 --> 00:34:51,640
Whereas on, I'm like on James inside even in like parts of like might be like I feel like easier to see to the viewer.

315
00:34:51,820 --> 00:35:00,129
They make sure to like cover him. Yeah. Yeah. If you look like the 87 is over him, I mean, like all the language, he's he's a background.

316
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:03,610
He's not a central figure reading each other.

317
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:10,110
And. Yeah, yeah. And it feels like they're maybe doing that to like, cover this tattoo.

318
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:14,320
It could be, too. Yeah, that's right. Like super esthetic, right?

319
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:18,280
Yeah. That's a really good point. Usually I know the photographer.

320
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:21,310
She also did smoke tiles cover. Yeah.

321
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:27,010
And there was a lot of controversy around that because the lighting on that was horrible.

322
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:31,870
It was so bad and she's like so gorgeous. And she just they did her so dirty with the lighting.

323
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:40,930
And like, I was looking at this just the way it's edited in the lighting, it literally does look like a spotlight on you.

324
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:50,799
And it's that point clear that like the lighting used in the shoot was like made for a white woman or someone like what color?

325
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,370
Like it's different lighting. It looks good on different skin tones.

326
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:57,720
And you can tell like they definitely didn't take that with this photo.

327
00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:01,840
Yeah. Yeah. Just looking at the photo itself, it looks so awkward.

328
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:05,780
Like, they're like they they look so uncomfortable to it's like hand.

329
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:13,000
Yeah. And so it's just really weird and like the differences in their outfits, I, that's not what I would expect like out of a Yeah, exactly.

330
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:19,390
Kind of like a flexible like Jersey thing and yeah, it just looks so awkward and like forced but not even good cause like,

331
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:24,429
you're up for that one more and jump off of what she said about the outfits.

332
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:27,800
Like what event could they possibly be going in a room?

333
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:31,450
And she's wearing an elegant dress and I'm pretty sure she's a Victoria's Secret model.

334
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:34,840
So, like, it's not like that's her uniform to wear or something, right? Exactly.

335
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:38,610
Like that was a job that's now accent.

336
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:43,750
So like all of these, this is critical consensus, you know, critiquing, picking things apart.

337
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:51,339
And this is different. People have, you know, we weren't the the geniuses who came up with this.

338
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:55,389
I mean, I'm I've read different like articles and critiques of this.

339
00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:58,420
So but it's it's really scary.

340
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:03,639
I mean, I know, first of all, I look at this, I'm like, oh, [INAUDIBLE], you know, cause like, they look exactly alike.

341
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:11,980
And if you think about during this time period, as, you know, Germans were, you know, the ultimate enemy.

342
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:17,740
And for for the, you know, to use an image of this,

343
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:28,060
like King Kong guerrilla type and then equating that with LeBron James, you know, even like here you see what it says.

344
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:34,270
I think it is like culture, but it's like a bloody, you know, stick.

345
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:39,429
I mean, it's just like so much violence and anger and hatred in there.

346
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:42,940
And then his face is almost exactly like that.

347
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:45,970
I mean, again, these are not these are not mistakes.

348
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:58,120
So just to throw in a little public health, you know, scientific evidence, the intervention actually had an effect, which is always good.

349
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:02,170
You know, sometimes we do these things that it's like, don't say we don't have any findings.

350
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:10,010
But we did see the. The guys that were in the movie Intervention are mobilizing our voices for empowerment.

351
00:38:10,170 --> 00:38:17,340
So greater increases over time in self efficacy for eliminating HIV risk behaviors and condom use self-efficacy.

352
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:24,090
So you know, what that means in real human terms is the guys felt like they actually could limit

353
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:31,340
their risk behavior and really felt like they could use condoms whenever they had sex.

354
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:33,389
So these are all guys living with HIV.

355
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:42,299
So when we're talking about economy, who's condom use is both how it can be a form of primary and secondary prevention,

356
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:46,740
because if they're not passing the virus on to others and also then they're not

357
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:51,900
getting potentially other strains or other entities that could complicate their HIV.

358
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:55,860
So it has a positive effect for both their partners and themselves.

359
00:38:56,370 --> 00:39:00,540
They demonstrated increases and in efficacy for HIV disclosure.

360
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:05,759
So that means they felt like they were better equipped to disclose their status

361
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,930
because a lot of times they weren't telling people and then having unprotected sex.

362
00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:20,640
Also perceived policy control with that is as we use the a scale of social political control,

363
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:27,059
which is really about do you feel like you have power and agency and broader society.

364
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:34,620
And so they that that scale really measures their belief that they can make a change in their community,

365
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:40,320
which is what we were trying to do, and then self-efficacy for eliminating HIV risk behavior.

366
00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:50,070
And then also what's really important is we saw greater decreases in condom was intercourse with negative and unknown partners.

367
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:51,899
And that's extremely important, too,

368
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:58,860
because if they're having unprotected sex with someone who is not dealing with HIV or they don't know their status,

369
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:07,050
there's the potential transmission to that other person. So we were really excited to see these types of changes.

370
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:18,600
Another thing that was even more cool that's not written in the article but is just a real live intervention effect.

371
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:29,310
That was pretty cool is during the time when we were doing this in New York, there was a campaign called It's It's Never Just HIV.

372
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:40,350
I want to see if I can really bad with YouTube thing so let's see oh my lord there's too many things that you like.

373
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:45,550
And I've seen you in. Are you old enough? Oh, my gosh.

374
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:49,180
It's happening. Okay. I understand.

375
00:40:52,870 --> 00:41:04,990
So can you give us your initial major function is never just HIV seeing HIV for always use a condom.

376
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:09,040
All right, let me do it again from the beginning, since I kind of screwed it up.

377
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:16,120
These new powers these have sometimes shuts down our assembly line.

378
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:20,530
Thanks for joining me here to begin with.

379
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:24,120
Someone, anybody. Mariah Carey. That's another.

380
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:35,130
You know, she cried like she does not something. And I just it just blew me away.

381
00:41:50,260 --> 00:42:03,940
But it's at times when I can get any answer from just HIV using HIV free media as a condom.

382
00:42:04,570 --> 00:42:13,090
All right. We're going to stop there. Oh, good.

383
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:16,480
Oh, yes. Do you see anything wrong with that ad?

384
00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:28,170
No, I don't think it works. Wasn't that even, like, kind of like how you can, like, encourage others to, like, promote their own self efficacy?

385
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:31,059
Like, with like with, like, ads like this.

386
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:40,719
You just like, I just like, like insulting them with like like images of like it's like like real cancer, but most likely mock like, have them want,

387
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:48,280
like I can do for like not like not want them to like with their own owners make them like,

388
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:52,660
kind of like enclosed, like with, like it just it won't help.

389
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:59,420
Right. And we generally don't talk about anal cancer, you know, like in everyday discourse or see pictures of that.

390
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:02,740
Yeah. Yeah. We actually watch the same video and one of my other problems.

391
00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:07,150
Oh, cool. And we were talking about how, like, fear is such a bad motivator.

392
00:43:07,270 --> 00:43:11,890
Yeah. So, like, we watch this and kind of I just.

393
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:16,749
I mean, it's not like, funny, but it's just like, a goofy thing to, like, do,

394
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:22,719
because I just think that's not a great way of our having people wear condoms for one.

395
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:27,790
And also just like stigmatizes HIV as well.

396
00:43:27,790 --> 00:43:32,170
So I feel like it's just a terrible like campaign that they put out in.

397
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:39,490
I mean, I don't know if they have data on how effective it was, but I assume it like probably didn't really change anyone's behavior.

398
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:48,810
Yeah. And the fear part, I mean, we know from lots of research that the relationship between fear and behavior change is an inverse.

399
00:43:48,830 --> 00:43:53,229
You know, with low levels of fear, you see no behavior change.

400
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:59,470
With moderate, you can see some. And with high you see none because people disengage from it.

401
00:43:59,950 --> 00:44:06,069
So they get so freaked out. Yeah, I was going to say I was just imagining being someone with HIV watching this and it basically

402
00:44:06,070 --> 00:44:09,100
feels like they're telling you you're going to die and there's nothing you can do about it.

403
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:13,899
And there's all these images of sick people. I just feel like that would cause so much fear and anxiety.

404
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:16,990
And if you do have HIV, there's no action item here.

405
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:21,540
Yeah, it's like 23 times, you know, so. And who are the people?

406
00:44:21,550 --> 00:44:26,920
It isn't. Yeah, this is a little unrelated, but like, even at the end, like, if you decided, like, okay,

407
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:31,330
you got so scared that you wanted to do something about it, there was like, oh, like for more info, call this number.

408
00:44:31,330 --> 00:44:34,180
But it was like so fast you could barely see it.

409
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:39,280
So like, even if you decided you wanted to take action, it's like they barely gave you an opportunity to do it, you know?

410
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:44,649
Yeah, if you notice. Oh, yeah, Anna, I would say, like, like HIV.

411
00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:51,940
Like, anyone can, like, give like like it's not just like gay men that, like, they can pass on HIV.

412
00:44:51,940 --> 00:45:00,610
So, like, the whole messaging of, like using only like gay men or like a seemingly and then just like talking about,

413
00:45:00,610 --> 00:45:05,889
I guess like they just it like, oh, if you pass on HIV, you'll get anal cancer, which I don't know.

414
00:45:05,890 --> 00:45:09,100
Also, I don't know why they said anal cancer when they could just say like prostate cancer.

415
00:45:09,110 --> 00:45:16,059
And so but again, I think this shows like it's very like ignorance of the fact that like straight

416
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:21,580
men also can just like I don't know why if they're messaging is to use a condom,

417
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:29,440
why not just make it an overarching thing? Yeah, I, I think with this and I'm shocked that I'm actually defending them a little bit.

418
00:45:30,850 --> 00:45:36,460
The, the campaign was purposely trying to to focus on younger gay men.

419
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:41,290
Now, you know, I don't know if you notice, but they're all men of color.

420
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:50,620
So that's again, another one of those messages. The people who are getting sick are sicker are our men of color.

421
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:59,680
So one thing that in the New York group in terms of when we're going through the critical consciousness,

422
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:06,580
exactly, this came up as one of the things that the men in the community were concerned about.

423
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:15,400
And so as part of their action planning, they actually organized to get this ad taken down.

424
00:46:16,450 --> 00:46:20,020
And there were other groups too. They weren't the only, but it was actually taken down.

425
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:22,809
So it was really cool, you know.

426
00:46:22,810 --> 00:46:31,870
And when you look at intervention effects, you know, most people only care about the condom use and, you know, unprotected sex, things like that.

427
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:39,200
But to me, this was like a great outcome to see that the men in that community were like, no, we're not putting up with this yet.

428
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:44,410
You know, this is a way to vilify gay men of color and.

429
00:46:44,470 --> 00:46:47,530
A way to scare them and all these other things.

430
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:52,870
And so through their actions and other groups, they actually took the step, which was really cool.

431
00:46:53,810 --> 00:47:00,350
All right. So we're going to get into your groups and I'm going to try and stay away from this computer.

432
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:04,940
Thought this possible that I feel of all of the groups.

433
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:09,180
And then for this one, you got it.

434
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:15,290
There's two different community scenarios and we'll show you the slide with those.

435
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:26,270
And in your group, pick one of them. And what you'll have to do as a group is you'll have to answer these questions about

436
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:35,150
designing an intervention that either utilizes critical consciousness or critical pedagogy,

437
00:47:36,050 --> 00:47:39,650
and then discuss these five questions in your group.

438
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:44,780
So who you involve in designing the intervention? How will you involve them?

439
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:51,860
How will you integrate critical consciousness or critical pedagogy, and what levels would the intervention occur?

440
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:57,620
So individual dyads belong to people, groups, family.

441
00:47:57,620 --> 00:48:01,999
And then if you were a participant in the intervention, what exactly would you experience?

442
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,820
I know this is a lot to do here at like 20 minutes,

443
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:12,980
but I want you to just be thinking about what would a real intervention look like, what would we need to be doing?

444
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:23,660
So we're going to do this for about 20 minutes. In the last 10 minutes, we'll come back and discuss some of the groups from last week.

445
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:32,090
So, you know, what kind of form of you remember where you were sitting last week?

446
00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:47,010
I go right back to, you know, I decided to do it alone.

447
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:52,690
It's always been there, done that. It doesn't work like that.

448
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:56,290
It was I mean, like, what are you working?

449
00:48:57,890 --> 00:49:12,980
Because I want to tell you right now with one way or another.

450
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:25,010
Oh, it was like a personal like there's always to find your group, let us know and then will quickly with another group.

451
00:49:26,190 --> 00:49:32,030
A lot of to be a long time for.

452
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:35,430
Well, first of all,

453
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:59,350
let me also go through all group wanted to focus on 31 kids just like you all to like cruising

454
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:25,600
for to you can be just before you are 34 oh my God oh I like the way I was never like I said.

455
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:35,730
Yeah, I know that you were gonna go.

456
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:52,270
Oh, yeah, but you know Levinson, let me ask you.

457
00:50:52,270 --> 00:51:02,440
All right, how would I know?

458
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:30,649
Right. So it's like, yeah, yeah, I suppose I can think of like, you know, I never got a chance to get started,

459
00:51:30,650 --> 00:51:35,130
and then we'll start, like, walk around and chat her like those are.

460
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:40,230
I can see her immediately. My memory.

461
00:51:41,670 --> 00:51:50,750
I don't even know who I.

462
00:51:53,930 --> 00:52:03,340
No. I mean, it's like, you know what I'm just saying?

463
00:52:11,330 --> 00:52:15,760
All right. So you're trying.

464
00:52:21,450 --> 00:52:30,480
Yeah. I think it's pretty much all.

465
00:52:34,390 --> 00:52:47,750
Yeah. I mean, like, I don't know, like, kind of, you know, like, a lot or not.

466
00:52:47,970 --> 00:52:52,230
I feel like. I don't know.

467
00:52:52,860 --> 00:53:12,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

468
00:53:16,770 --> 00:54:04,680
That might be hard to get a lot of credit as a somewhat Human Rights Watch this morning about how,

469
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:25,350
you know, the network teaches them how to find out what's what's around.

470
00:54:26,890 --> 00:54:51,080
You see that all together? Now, that could be the population is like high risk diabetes, heart disease, so like mainstream.

471
00:54:54,030 --> 00:55:05,250
Are you cold or anything like that to get out of?

472
00:55:06,190 --> 00:55:17,740
Like, I guess like where there are things you don't like, where they do.

473
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:37,890
Like I thought it was like trying to tell you you I was just like,

474
00:55:41,530 --> 00:55:56,340
I guess I can't even like just having my cheek so much that I started to be around, like.

475
00:55:56,700 --> 00:56:18,960
Yeah, I know that. That's kind of like now that there is a lot of them to start thinking about.

476
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:37,200
Are your thoughts like executing, you know, little things like what do you think?

477
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:46,650
How do I mean?

478
00:56:48,510 --> 00:56:56,470
I don't know. I do like I was like part of our society, I guess now.

479
00:56:56,500 --> 00:57:13,560
Right. But I mean, obviously, like, like in the way that they're constantly demonstrating, easily prepared is exactly like that.

480
00:57:15,810 --> 00:57:22,320
These. I don't like.

481
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:57,940
So I guess the reality is they might not be able to stay out of this.

482
00:57:59,570 --> 00:58:03,180
I kind of I don't know.

483
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:21,650
I, I think it's just because I don't think that everyone would have the same rights.

484
00:58:22,930 --> 00:58:31,580
I think it's something like that.

485
00:58:32,040 --> 00:59:12,830
I don't want to talk about like it's like that because it's like I don't know where you to go to the United Nations.

486
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:18,360
How did you feel when you realize the same place?

487
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:29,570
Like I was nine years old. But God it's one thing about struggling with it.

488
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:34,140
Basically, like. Like you're going to be tied to the government.

489
00:59:37,680 --> 01:00:06,300
Oh, my God. So I feel like a lot of people this is an area like bankruptcy was like, oh, yeah, you have a name?

490
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:28,870
Oh, good lord. I think I don't want to go, but I don't like that approach.

491
01:00:28,870 --> 01:00:35,070
Seems to be like.

492
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:43,010
It's probably got about. Oh, it's got to be out there.

493
01:00:43,110 --> 01:01:11,929
I don't want to sound like the only one who I think is actually starting to lose the family, depending on the individual.

494
01:01:11,930 --> 01:01:24,390
So I know I've been doing it for like two years now that I'm gonna talk about some things that you feel like.

495
01:01:25,580 --> 01:02:14,960
Oh, yeah, I think it's. If I don't have that problem, it's like I realize, like, just, like, I don't know, I don't think, like, I'm sorry.

496
01:02:15,590 --> 01:02:29,200
I just. I don't know.

497
01:02:29,280 --> 01:03:02,150
Like, I was like, you know, where, you know, they say, I don't like to be like, you know, like I got it wrong.

498
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:18,050
I think everybody else, I think I just don't, like, feel more or less likely to help.

499
01:03:18,230 --> 01:03:37,970
You know, I'm not you start realizing, like, oh, my gosh, I like.

500
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:58,850
Oh. Highs and lows.

501
01:03:59,780 --> 01:04:23,780
How do you think your audience are using this to CBS Radio?

502
01:04:23,990 --> 01:05:00,410
One of the first times you don't get access to work every day, it's kind of like, Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's nice.

503
01:05:00,770 --> 01:05:08,240
And they go to lunch. I like all that stuff.

504
01:05:10,490 --> 01:05:35,150
It's like when I started out, I was like, you know, I just felt like it.

505
01:05:35,180 --> 01:05:38,480
Just because these are all.

506
01:05:42,710 --> 01:05:55,390
I'm just playing, as I say, like this not necessary story.

507
01:05:55,400 --> 01:06:07,730
So every time I hear a lot of like separating or anything like that, we know it's really cool.

508
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:12,850
Okay. Yeah.

509
01:06:17,650 --> 01:06:23,160
Just an intervention.

510
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:37,970
Oh, yeah.

511
01:06:42,220 --> 01:06:47,950
Just to highlight the like that.

512
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:55,780
Like I was like.

513
01:06:55,780 --> 01:07:17,780
What? The book. I think maybe there are actually two weeks and it's like, oh, god, no, I don't want to it.

514
01:07:24,430 --> 01:07:34,780
I'm sorry. I guess. I just guess I like having you around.

515
01:07:35,260 --> 01:07:41,640
So you think I'll just sit where you are? I mean, we're still on Panopto.

516
01:07:41,930 --> 01:07:46,840
I think I'm not going with the Michael. Sorry, Panopto people.

517
01:07:48,850 --> 01:07:52,000
So process. So what was this like?

518
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:58,410
And don't all talk at once. I know you're really excited to talk. Okay, but just trying.

519
01:07:58,820 --> 01:08:05,040
Yes, but I would say it's a little hard to design an intervention when we don't know that.

520
01:08:05,310 --> 01:08:09,100
We don't know how much fun. Yeah. Good.

521
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:13,299
That's. I did that on purpose. No, it is.

522
01:08:13,300 --> 01:08:19,390
I mean, it's hard, but we're going to add something to it. Yeah, the funding part, I think that's my hardest problem.

523
01:08:19,390 --> 01:08:22,730
Like where it's getting the resources from. Right.

524
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:30,190
We don't know where that's now. So we think like a nonprofit will work with like state departments, get money from them.

525
01:08:31,410 --> 01:08:35,740
We haven't worked in the past with federal governments. I know how hard it is to get funding.

526
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:42,820
So especially go into rural Michigan and you know, how are you going to do you even have the resources like the professionals in that area?

527
01:08:42,830 --> 01:08:46,210
Right. You have to bring someone in from like lower peninsula and all that stuff.

528
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:50,590
Okay. Yeah. So I should've said unlimited, but, um.

529
01:08:51,010 --> 01:08:56,590
But. But that's okay. Um. What else? Especially the critical conscious part.

530
01:08:56,620 --> 01:09:00,370
So was that easy? Yeah, well, I was.

531
01:09:00,370 --> 01:09:04,260
I had before you asked the next day in this critical contest, we.

532
01:09:04,870 --> 01:09:12,750
We were starting, and we thought then we started questioning, like, are there grocery stores, number one, or are there grocery stores?

533
01:09:12,820 --> 01:09:20,530
They incorporate new, more nutritious food. Is there nutritious food and and like a reasonable distance away from the center of this community?

534
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:25,990
Mm hmm. Um, and, like, then you start questioning why.

535
01:09:25,990 --> 01:09:33,910
Why isn't there grocery stores here? So one of those sort of that critical consciousness that we faced when we were trying to design the intervention.

536
01:09:34,060 --> 01:09:38,799
But it sounds like you're asking a lot of really good questions. You know, kind of, again, going back to like a problem in approach.

537
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:43,000
I mean, you're you're thinking in the right way about like what kind of more information do we need?

538
01:09:43,240 --> 01:09:46,389
Because, you know, we didn't give you much information at all. Right.

539
01:09:46,390 --> 01:09:54,940
So it was kind of purposely set up like that. How challenging not challenging was it to make it critical?

540
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:58,630
So to incorporate either critical consciousness or critical pedagogy.

541
01:09:58,990 --> 01:10:04,030
Did you struggle with that? In the past, folks have had a hard time.

542
01:10:04,030 --> 01:10:10,620
That is, I think, our group. It was definitely difficult because I think we think of something which would make us think of another thing.

543
01:10:10,990 --> 01:10:16,360
And then it started like spiraling like, oh my God, I think about that.

544
01:10:16,590 --> 01:10:20,980
Yeah. So that was kind of our issue. But that's good.

545
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:25,810
I know it's not always fun, but. But that's good because it means you're being critical and your thinking.

546
01:10:26,110 --> 01:10:30,460
And that's the thing is that when you do interventions that have a critical component,

547
01:10:30,820 --> 01:10:36,430
it is more challenging because it's not, Oh, I have the easy answer, but what about this?

548
01:10:36,430 --> 01:10:43,360
And then what if I did this in this community? And what if they don't have this and all of those like it was bad that we went on a spiral,

549
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:49,089
but it was good because all those things are interconnected and we talk about that like we started with access problems and

550
01:10:49,090 --> 01:10:54,180
then we went to historical implications and then we went to not as trust and all those things kind of like tied together.

551
01:10:54,190 --> 01:11:00,040
We just went so quickly that I feel like if we had more time, we could go into more relatively quickly.

552
01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:04,389
We're just, I don't know, kind of. Yeah, yeah. But no, that's great though.

553
01:11:04,390 --> 01:11:08,650
I mean, again, that's the process we want you to be doing is to think about the historical implications,

554
01:11:08,950 --> 01:11:14,890
think about, you know, access, think about the environment, think about all those other things, other other groups.

555
01:11:16,780 --> 01:11:22,060
Who had a really amazing intervention component that you'd like to share with the class.

556
01:11:22,750 --> 01:11:26,740
Tell me about your critical intervention component.

557
01:11:26,980 --> 01:11:33,980
What did you do that either utilized critical pedagogy, critical concerns in the back home?

558
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:42,670
So our group looked at community one, which is the problem, and chronic illness and radiation and all.

559
01:11:42,670 --> 01:11:49,390
And something that we talked about is like we all got into our experiences like with, like, like how are we like.

560
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:54,490
Like especially like cooking food and whatnot and like all of the stuff but like access and things like that.

561
01:11:54,730 --> 01:12:02,350
So something that we talked about was like how oftentimes like empowering people through like the kitchen and like making different foods.

562
01:12:02,980 --> 01:12:09,490
So like maybe having like little cooking classes. I talked about how like I did that at my school when I was a kid and how like that was

563
01:12:09,490 --> 01:12:13,629
kind of a gateway into teaching kids about like how to like cut fruits and vegetables,

564
01:12:13,630 --> 01:12:17,890
how to operate like these different machines safely and like stuff like that.

565
01:12:17,890 --> 01:12:26,680
And also like being like culturally competent because like there's a lot of labor that goes into making food and especially like having

566
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:33,190
kids maybe cook these different like cultural foods or foods that are like specialties in that they're like families in their community.

567
01:12:33,850 --> 01:12:41,050
It can really be like empowering to them because it's like now they have access to like kind of incorporate the different like things like that.

568
01:12:41,650 --> 01:12:47,770
And how is that critical? What, what about that? I mean, it's a great approach, but what about that makes it a critical approach?

569
01:12:48,550 --> 01:12:55,410
I think that looking at like, I guess like the model of like empowerment and education, like using that as, like.

570
01:12:55,510 --> 01:13:02,020
Like stuff like that as a tool to help kids learn how to do these different things and like decide which foods or how.

571
01:13:02,710 --> 01:13:07,120
And I understand that rather than teaching them and like this is like, how do you decide, okay,

572
01:13:07,750 --> 01:13:12,310
it allows them to kind of make those decisions like more and more like different situations.

573
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:15,639
Good. Yeah. Just like supporting intervention.

574
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:22,990
I learned in an education class we took last year or something super similar that change and like actual

575
01:13:22,990 --> 01:13:32,530
learning and understanding in children and like throughout school is most efficient when like they're able to.

576
01:13:34,270 --> 01:13:37,690
Really the things they're learning and doing with their own culture.

577
01:13:38,230 --> 01:13:46,840
So I saw things like teachers, like giving students the opportunity to choose how they want to like carry out certain projects.

578
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:51,610
Like they can do it through music, through like different foods and stuff like that for.

579
01:13:52,030 --> 01:13:56,740
Yeah. How many folks have heard of, like, Montessori schools and monetary education?

580
01:13:56,950 --> 01:14:00,399
Yeah. So that educational approach is really grounded,

581
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:07,180
theoretically and connected a lot with like critical concepts and that like critical exploration and things like that.

582
01:14:07,660 --> 01:14:12,639
What other amazing things? ADLER Um, we discussed the cooking class as well,

583
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:18,820
and like the importance of like actually not just providing resources but providing the ability to like,

584
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:25,090
not like teach individuals how to prepare healthy foods, healthier foods.

585
01:14:25,510 --> 01:14:30,240
And then like the initial step that we kind of talked about was maybe like a weekly like

586
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:36,490
pop up farmer's market or mobile grocery store that provided this community with cheaper,

587
01:14:36,490 --> 01:14:42,730
healthier options such as produce, vegetables and things like that, that which they can later incorporate into the cooking process.

588
01:14:42,970 --> 01:14:48,730
Okay. So those are some nice interactions that I think are really helpful and they're interactive.

589
01:14:49,540 --> 01:14:52,990
Can you take it a little bit further to make it a little more critical?

590
01:14:53,740 --> 01:14:55,960
It sounds like a couple of groups did that. Yeah.

591
01:14:56,320 --> 01:15:00,549
So one thing that we talked about is kind of like in regards to, I guess, the foods that you're going to teach them,

592
01:15:00,550 --> 01:15:07,270
it's not like you don't want to push a Western diet on them because like they have maybe like their own recipes and their own way of doing things.

593
01:15:07,270 --> 01:15:10,209
And so you don't really want to come in and be like, Well, this is how we make food. You should do that.

594
01:15:10,210 --> 01:15:14,490
Like, it's like you kind of want to cater it to their own traditions and things like that.

595
01:15:14,920 --> 01:15:22,330
Okay. So yeah, we're kind of talking about like what assumptions we might be making about the state of food access,

596
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:28,120
like is high nutrient like high quality food affordable?

597
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:33,580
Because we were talking about how we've been aware of like overpricing in some indigenous nations.

598
01:15:33,940 --> 01:15:39,210
And so you're talking about, okay, like what do we need to know about the supply lines or there?

599
01:15:39,790 --> 01:15:44,619
But we're also talking about in terms like critical pedagogy that the community members would

600
01:15:44,620 --> 01:15:50,440
need to be involved in identifying the state of the issue and also creating intervention.

601
01:15:50,890 --> 01:15:54,250
So you're bringing up like questions about how we can proceed with creating the

602
01:15:54,250 --> 01:15:58,540
intervention itself until we know the state of the issue within the community.

603
01:15:58,840 --> 01:16:01,920
Good test involves critical take on. Yeah.

604
01:16:02,350 --> 01:16:10,059
Sort both. Also thing that you talked about our group just thinking about like how like culturally food has been prepared in like we

605
01:16:10,060 --> 01:16:16,600
don't want to be the ones like Tommy in terms of like act like we're dismantling like that and trying to just push like,

606
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:20,710
oh, this is what you guys need to be doing differently. So that was one thing we were talking about,

607
01:16:21,070 --> 01:16:28,180
starting with talking to the community about what they've been doing in the past and how that's worked and has not worked also.

608
01:16:28,510 --> 01:16:31,270
And then also like the last group was saying,

609
01:16:31,390 --> 01:16:40,299
just like understanding where they're getting their food from and like what is going on in the community like and the access that they have.

610
01:16:40,300 --> 01:16:42,340
And why is this like the issue?

611
01:16:42,340 --> 01:16:49,290
So I think we're talking about like also bringing like epidemiology into it a little bit just to track like where did this begin?

612
01:16:49,300 --> 01:16:56,290
Kind of like where is the chronic disease starting from and like even I guess bringing like bridging the gap,

613
01:16:56,290 --> 01:17:02,709
like the lack of trust that might also be involved in bringing people into the community to try and be like,

614
01:17:02,710 --> 01:17:08,140
Oh, we want to help you guys, but we also don't want to just be telling you what to do.

615
01:17:08,140 --> 01:17:11,830
So that was one thing we were like trying to figure out how do we balance both of

616
01:17:11,830 --> 01:17:16,510
those things and also make sure we're like creating lasting change in the community.

617
01:17:17,410 --> 01:17:23,500
Yeah. And one thing to think about, and I saw it in our hearing, we're going to try it on the end, but is you know, when you're thinking about it,

618
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:29,500
especially with a lot of Native American, American-Indian, indigenous groups, you know, their land was taken away.

619
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:34,719
So especially with the Ojibwe others, they're spread across multiple states.

620
01:17:34,720 --> 01:17:39,580
So we artificially created states, but their nation spreads across states.

621
01:17:39,580 --> 01:17:42,160
So there's a lot that's been taken away from them.

622
01:17:42,430 --> 01:17:46,659
So now if you're going in and say, now we're going to take away your food, you know, think about that.

623
01:17:46,660 --> 01:17:50,229
So you have to really join with them, talk about the history.

624
01:17:50,230 --> 01:17:52,360
You have to be really clear about the history.

625
01:17:52,660 --> 01:17:59,080
And, you know, we realize that these things have happened and there's, you know, Michigan sits on native land.

626
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:08,530
And so really grounding what you're doing in that process and recognizing and owning what a lot of institutions have done instead of just saying,

627
01:18:08,530 --> 01:18:14,680
we're going to change your food right now, because even if you have them engage with you and you're cooking their traditional food,

628
01:18:15,100 --> 01:18:20,079
that historical aspect is still in their head and may be the cause of some rejection.

629
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:29,140
I'm sorry we didn't get to all the questions. One quick thing real quick. How many people did community number one, how many did community number two?

630
01:18:30,010 --> 01:18:43,440
All right. We'll talk about that next. Class I. Good that we can make our own change for now.

631
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:47,651
For a long time. I'm sorry. I have.
