1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:18,060
Yeah. I think, you know, last year I really like when it looked like it was going to be like.

2
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:26,759
Like, I don't know if I can take me with myself to something like that.

3
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:32,880
You've never been anything like that.

4
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:41,310
My family doesn't seem to figure out what's likely to happen, but it takes 24 hours.

5
00:00:41,790 --> 00:01:18,980
And then you say, Yeah, yeah, well, I didn't really remember that.

6
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:53,610
Coming up on the 700, I believe, because I was asking my this is like last year was even a year and it was like, that's cool, really nice terrorism.

7
00:01:53,610 --> 00:02:03,290
So like he was saying it for a great success right.

8
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:06,480
That once you find out where it was.

9
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:12,200
Exactly. So we were in Jasper just driving.

10
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:18,990
Sometimes there's a lot of people don't just grab it, be like, oh, you know, he's gonna say, Thank God.

11
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:30,270
I'm like, I have this problem, like, slowly, like, yeah, it's a bad just like, it's kind of like Easter.

12
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:39,160
No, you can't just like like tonight.

13
00:02:42,660 --> 00:03:03,190
Like, oh, yeah. We Toronto for you are inspired by the federal government's mandatory best friend.

14
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:52,800
This woman had a weird ponytail. Even if you stand right about feet and you speak.

15
00:03:53,650 --> 00:04:01,090
Semi-Circle is perfectly positioned as an echo point to talk in a brief balance sheet from all directions.

16
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:04,810
The rear discs are.

17
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:18,600
Lauren for people struggling. Any questions as you start to like.

18
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:26,700
And I need to be long. She. It's not necessarily going to help you.

19
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:35,880
I'm happy to answer any questions you might have as well. Before we talk a lot more about characteristics of speeches today.

20
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:42,690
Obviously we've got lots of examples to work with. Seems pretty straightforward.

21
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,200
One question, but I think we might have the day.

22
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:55,229
But just in general of the speeches we read where they're like, come on, they're doing like the educating.

23
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:58,320
But you're like, we're not supposed to do in our speech.

24
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:07,860
So I don't think any of the speeches I've given you.

25
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:19,370
Go really heavily into educating. There's obviously some science that pops into all of them.

26
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,880
We're talking about diseases. So. But.

27
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:31,820
I'm trying to think back how much Abbott has in his speech.

28
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:38,139
I don't think it times and when it is there, it's not there in a format of here.

29
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,760
Let me tell you about flu.

30
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:49,480
It's there in a format to make an argument that the threat of the pandemic that he's broadcasting is real and needs to be taken seriously.

31
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:57,370
And that's a different feeling you're going to bring. You may bring scientific components into this if you want to make an argument.

32
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:01,840
But that's different than essentially what you would write on a fact sheet.

33
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:09,760
We have a fact sheet stuff. This is about making a persuasive argument to your audience that.

34
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:19,720
Take this seriously or they should not freak out too much. Or like what it is that you want them to feel and think and do in this moment.

35
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:27,610
Yeah. So I sounds like I think what you're saying is, like the context setting is different than education.

36
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:33,540
Yeah. Let me do you a quick follow up on that.

37
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:43,500
Much like what I tried to guide you with on the test results.

38
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:50,840
There's a difference between knowing your status, knowing what's going on in the moment,

39
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:55,130
and knowing everything that you need to know and do from that point forward.

40
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:00,380
This is the start conversation, not the finished conversation.

41
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:09,860
A crisis speech, especially one like the way I'm setting this up for your assignment, is the first point of contact.

42
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:16,700
It's new, it's uncertain, and that character is the critical thing that has to be addressed.

43
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:27,630
So obviously there is relevant information because part of what people want in a crisis is to understand what is known.

44
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:33,170
Like, hey, I didn't even know this thing existed. What should I think? What should I know about this kind of stuff?

45
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:38,630
But this is, I think, the simplest way to put this.

46
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:45,720
There's a difference between what? They need to know and what you know.

47
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:53,319
The communication in almost all such circumstances, but certainly in a crisis,

48
00:07:53,320 --> 00:08:00,310
needs to be focused on what do they need to know which is out of the audience's shoes.

49
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:04,780
It's not a question of how much you know, the question of what do they need to know?

50
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:18,930
Yeah. So we are kind of saying like, are we the first point of contact for them to discover that?

51
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:28,030
Yes. Okay. Assume the scenario I have in mind is the county health department finds out about

52
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:35,490
these cases and you're briefing the press as like more widely known on that.

53
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:40,330
Now, assuming you are you are talking to the online reporter.

54
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:46,479
We put this online in an hour and we'll be the first point of contact for everybody.

55
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,510
And maybe there is somebody from, you know,

56
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:56,970
one of the TV stations there because it's giving us news because it's obviously like you are the first point of contact.

57
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,360
You may have gathered information from other sources.

58
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:09,810
Let's say there may be some information from a national source or from a hospital source that you might be saying, hey, here's what we know.

59
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:15,070
Fine. But assume essentially for your target audience, they had never heard of this before now.

60
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:29,560
Other questions. The other thing I would say, which I think is obvious, is that.

61
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,639
But it's worth repeating. Speeches are speeches.

62
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:41,080
They aren't reports. So try as much as you can to write this the way you would say it.

63
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:48,120
And honestly, if you get a little bit stuck.

64
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:57,260
My advice to you is start talking it out loud and see what you want to say and then write it down and you're going to be pretty close.

65
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:08,120
Look, people sometimes get led astray is what looks okay in written form is not so okay.

66
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:13,920
Would you say it out loud? Because it comes across as.

67
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:20,100
Didactic or pompous or droning on and on or whatever.

68
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:25,110
So you are you're trying to write a speech.

69
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:37,260
I don't know what you would say to a general audience, too, with the assumption that the public will also be able to hear this and learn from it, etc.

70
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:54,870
Any other thoughts for? If more come up, please feel free to contact us at the end of the class after we've gone through lots of these speeches.

71
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:02,120
Reach out to me over the weekend. I will say this.

72
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:11,250
That Sam an article from last class. It's dilemmas, but I will have those dilemmas in my mind as I'm reading your speeches.

73
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:15,210
So I'm not saying you have to do everything.

74
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:23,640
You certainly do not. But if you that's as close to a checklist as I can give you for this in terms of things to be thinking about.

75
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:37,290
I. So. I have you read several things related to COBRA, the Abbott speech from years ago.

76
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:43,110
The one I want to start with though to sort of ground us is.

77
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:54,420
The 29 H1N1 shot, and I asked you to read one piece of a speech from them.

78
00:11:54,540 --> 00:12:01,470
I want to play for you some experts, expert excerpts of one of the press briefings.

79
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:06,840
And as I alluded to, I think it was last class. Pay attention to.

80
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:12,980
Some of the ways in which the principles people are talking about are.

81
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:19,270
Done by the speaker in this context, I think there's really interesting, good examples.

82
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:27,340
This particular army set the stage, though. This particular speech was not done right at the start.

83
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:39,280
This particular press briefing came at the moment, at the early stages of them thinking about vaccine rollout.

84
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:45,100
So the disease had been circulating for a while, but there was lots of uncertainty about the vaccine.

85
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:52,760
So that was the that was the context for this this moment in time, which is obviously still a crisis there.

86
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:59,620
Lots of uncertainty about the vaccine going to work or is it going to be, you know, am I going to able to get it type of stuff?

87
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:08,440
That's the timing of it. So this was done in I believe it was late September of 2029.

88
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:19,110
I'm the meeting over to Glen Doherty. Thank you, sir. You may begin. Thank you.

89
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:25,000
Thank you all for joining us today, both in person on the line for our weekly update on the H1N1 situation.

90
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:31,000
Seasonal flu situation in the United States today will be provided by Dr. Thomas Frieden,

91
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,990
the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, from the podium.

92
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:43,350
Dr. Frieden. Good afternoon.

93
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:49,169
What we like to do today is to tell you what we know and what we don't know about what's

94
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:54,810
happening with H1N1 and what's happening with vaccine preparations and production.

95
00:13:55,980 --> 00:14:04,530
What we do know is that H1N1 is spreading right through the air throughout the U.S., particularly in the southern states.

96
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,800
But in most of the country, H1N1 activity is now life.

97
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:17,219
Right? We also know that so far there's been no change in the pattern of disease among people who've

98
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:25,470
become ill on anyone have had disease similar to these in the in a normal flu season.

99
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:34,690
Moderates don't think that it has affected pregnant disproportionately younger adults and children, people ages 5 to 24.

100
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:41,550
And although people sometimes think of the flu as a mild illness, that having to do with no picnic.

101
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:47,010
Even in an average case, they cannot do that on your back for a couple of days.

102
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:55,559
You can miss school and work how difficult the and in severe cases they can put you in the hospital

103
00:14:55,560 --> 00:15:03,240
and tragically some people have died with H1N1 and we will inevitably see that in the future.

104
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:11,190
Our challenge is to minimize the number of people who become severely ill or who die from influenza.

105
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:21,840
So far, laboratory studies have shown that there has been no significant change in the genetic makeup of the circulating H1N1.

106
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:30,930
And it really did mean that the vaccine that we have coming off the production lines shortly is a very effective match,

107
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:34,799
and that's an excellent match with the virus continuing to circulate,

108
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:40,940
which suggests that it is likely to be highly effective at preventing illness in all regions.

109
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:44,880
And so far, the disease is not likely to come then.

110
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:49,470
All right. What I'm going to describe is first what we know and what we don't know.

111
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:55,290
We know a lot about what's happened so far. We can't predict what's going to happen in the future.

112
00:15:55,740 --> 00:16:00,960
Influenza is perhaps the most unpredictable of all infectious diseases.

113
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:11,400
Although millions of people have become sick with H1N1, the overwhelming majority of them don't need testing or treatments.

114
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:20,250
However, if you're severely ill, which is having trouble breathing or having underlying conditions like heart disease,

115
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:23,160
diabetes, women who are pregnant,

116
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:33,720
it's important to get treated promptly because treatment in the first 48 hours is most and challenging because it means that on the one hand,

117
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:42,310
we're encouraging people to contact their doctors or use health care in most cases, but in certain cases to get care promptly.

118
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:46,590
One of the real challenges about dealing with H1N1 influenza this season.

119
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:52,470
We also know that there is plenty of cannabis available.

120
00:16:53,190 --> 00:17:00,540
And although it's important that you care for people who need to be treated or

121
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:04,860
people who have underlining underlying conditions or who are severely ill,

122
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:08,340
it should not be used generally for prevention,

123
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:15,899
and it should not be used for most mild average cases of influenza that where the people who really need it will have

124
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:23,040
enough to go around and we won't have as big of a risk of resistance because resistance we know how to develop.

125
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:31,549
So we have to preserve that for when we really need it. We also know that although we've been widespread this year,

126
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:36,870
we've seen relatively few school closures and that's consistent with what the recommended of

127
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:43,460
last month to minimize the disruption to learning and to communities when H1N1 is presents.

128
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:49,530
Common sense measures can reduce but not prevent the spread of influenza.

129
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:53,559
The most important thing to stay home is that if you have fever,

130
00:17:53,560 --> 00:18:00,370
stay home for at least 24 hours after you have no fever when you're off all fever inducing medications.

131
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:06,370
Also, of course, cover your mouth when you cough or sneeze and wash your hands frequently.

132
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:14,050
That's some of the things some of the things that we know about influenza, there's a lot that we don't know as well we don't know.

133
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:21,490
And only the future will count. If H1N1 influenza becomes more deadly in the weeks and months to come,

134
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:31,390
we don't know whether the fact that it's beginning to trend down in some areas suggests that it will completely go away in those areas.

135
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:35,890
We don't know whether that will be over weeks or months.

136
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:40,030
And if it doesn't go away, we don't know when it will come back this season.

137
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:46,089
We also don't know whether we will have another of the other circulating flu.

138
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:51,400
Viruses such as H three are present still in many parts of the world.

139
00:18:51,850 --> 00:19:00,370
And just because we're having an outbreak of each one doesn't mean we won't have an outbreak of H three later on this year.

140
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:06,990
Only time will tell. So people take home.

141
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:16,840
For those of us in public health, health care or not prevent the spread of the virus is spreading in different ways for the

142
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:22,900
coming year and to be ready to adjust our approach if it does and for the public to stay home,

143
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:32,320
cover your car, wash your hands, and if you are at risk of serious illness and become infected or ill,

144
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:37,300
you get treated promptly and vaccine becomes available.

145
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:42,430
You get it back. And that is what we don't know and don't know about vaccines.

146
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:46,930
All right. So I'm going to pause there. What did you hear?

147
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:52,990
What did you notice? The things that Dr. Frieden did.

148
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:57,929
Yeah. He started out the whole speech by saying,

149
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:05,580
we're going to talk about things that we know and things that we do not know and came back to that at least two or three different times.

150
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:09,370
Yeah. What else? Yeah.

151
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:15,510
He mentioned what people need to know and in order to get care and who needs

152
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:21,060
to get care and notice that it was kind of framed in a dilemma kind of way.

153
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:29,590
I mean, he talked about this is a new I forget the word to use like complicated or nuanced message like these people are can stay home.

154
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:37,630
These people will need to seek care. This is tricky. No, that's unusual in some sense to sort of say why guidance is going to be hard.

155
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:47,199
But he's owning the fact that this is a nuanced message and that he needs people to have to agree that not everybody needs to seek care immediately,

156
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,200
that many people can be at home, etc. What else?

157
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:52,930
Yeah. Concrete examples throughout.

158
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:58,780
Like instead of saying like, we don't know what happened in this instance, it was like, well, we've been seeing this thing,

159
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:01,800
which means that it might be going down or we might have another flu season,

160
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:06,550
like kind of giving people a range of ideas as to what that actually means in practice.

161
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:16,210
Well, and the reason I really like that is you can easily imagine some in the public, some journalists looking at the trend of the data and going,

162
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:25,360
but doesn't this mean and he's anticipating their reaction and saying, you know, I see it, too, but we don't know what that means.

163
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:31,870
And that is addressing the emotional need, the emotional needs of the audience.

164
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:36,610
They see this demonology, it exists and then enabling you to respond to it.

165
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:41,399
What else? Yeah. You used at the very beginning.

166
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:48,580
It used widespread and no picnic. Yeah, it's much more alarmist than like, oh, you know, it's just the flu.

167
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:53,379
It's no like even what you think about the flu. Realize that it can knock you down.

168
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:56,710
It could he says it could hospitalize you. It could even kill you.

169
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:06,280
So he's definitely raising the alarm there. Yeah. And I really like the way he framed that piece about mortality.

170
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:10,870
There it was. You know, unfortunately, we've already had some people forget the exact words, but basically,

171
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:17,559
unfortunately, we've already had some people die and undoubtedly there will be more like that.

172
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:25,780
Was it sort of like crazy alarmist? It's just owning the reality that this is not going to stop at this point in time and that more

173
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:31,000
people will die and that that needs to be part of the conversation about the threat of this disease.

174
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:35,870
Right. What else? Yeah.

175
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:41,080
I thought you did a good job of being clear about, like, why certain things are happening.

176
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:46,040
So with the Tamiflu stockpiling, he was like, this is going to the most vulnerable for this reason.

177
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,470
And like,

178
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:57,800
it was just like a and this goes back again to this idea of help people understand why they come to the same conclusions that you've already come to.

179
00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:00,950
He's like, Well, we can't give everybody Tamiflu. We don't have enough.

180
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:10,280
We need to preserve it. We're worried about resistance, etc. So he raises that dilemma and clarifies why the policy is what it is.

181
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:17,330
Now, you might then say, Yeah, I should get it, but at least you know, there is a reason and it has been brought up explicitly.

182
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:25,090
What else? Yeah. I thought you did a good job with, like, Sammy individually addressing each audience.

183
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:32,560
So, like he explicitly said, like as health care professionals and public health officials, your job is to help monitor the community.

184
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:36,760
And as part of the community, your job is to monitor yourself.

185
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:41,340
If you're sick, stay home like you're feeling these symptoms, your risk, all of the above.

186
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:49,090
And that is a key piece of this is each group has something to do, even if what to do is to monitor.

187
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:55,639
That is a thing. So. Your task is to your scientists.

188
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:58,460
Your task is to keep monitoring whether this virus is changing.

189
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:05,839
And if your task is a patient, your task is to monitor your own symptoms and add some criteria.

190
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,830
And if you meet those, you do this. If you don't, then you do that, etc.

191
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:15,770
So in this moment when there's uncertainty, he's basically giving people their marching orders.

192
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:20,580
You need to do this. You need to do this. You need to do this. Else.

193
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,690
The one thing I want to really highlight which has come up already,

194
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:42,060
but I really want to emphasize it is how much effort you put into talking about the potential for things to go differently.

195
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:52,440
So you must have raised the idea that the you know, what might get more deadly at least two or three times.

196
00:24:53,430 --> 00:25:00,780
He certainly raised the idea that that flu is the least predictable of agents out there.

197
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:08,880
So sort of the idea that whatever he says might have to change got reinforced over and over and over again.

198
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:17,380
Really acknowledging the uncertainty. Notice this is the absolute opposite of all the reassure and.

199
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:22,810
He's not. I mean, there's no worst case scenario here.

200
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:25,270
He's not painting a doomsday scenario,

201
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:31,060
but he's certainly acknowledging the fact that there's lots of possibilities that things might turn out to be different.

202
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:34,600
So he's saying on the one hand, look.

203
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:43,840
At the moment, it looks like the vaccine that we've got coming off production line is a really good match to the current virus and very quickly said.

204
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:48,900
But this thing might change or we might have a different virus show up, etc.

205
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:53,510
So you know that that perfect match that has now could go away.

206
00:25:55,370 --> 00:26:00,770
Yeah. I think something that I liked about like re-emphasizing the uncertainty with that.

207
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:04,660
I imagine that it's going to make people pay better attention to it.

208
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:09,079
Or it's like if you over reassure them, they're like, Oh, I'm reassured and I feel this way.

209
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:13,610
First, people like, No, you need to keep monitoring it. That means you need to keep updating on what's happening.

210
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:19,669
Yeah. And notice this is connect the dots here. If your task is to monitor, why do I have to keep doing this?

211
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:22,999
Why? Because this is unpredictable.

212
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,570
Things might change. We need to know whether something has changed, etc.

213
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:30,460
So you're answering the question, why do I have to do this thing you're telling me to do?

214
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:39,740
Other things you picked up from this. This is a subtle thing.

215
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:47,570
It's not really in the words, but it's in the style. Notice that there is a deliberate pace of delivery.

216
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:53,960
This is not somebody who is coming across as.

217
00:26:55,010 --> 00:27:01,280
Ford. But this is coming across as somebody who thinks that everything that they're saying is important

218
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:08,810
and wants to make sure that you hear each piece of the information because it's important.

219
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:14,059
So the tone is reflected in some sense.

220
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:21,760
The genuineness of that person's perspective in that moment like this is a tape and we're in the middle of a crisis like this is months into this,

221
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:26,690
like they've been doing these briefings on a weekly basis. This is not a tearful moment,

222
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:32,809
but it is a moment of emotion in the sense of Dr. Frieden is really thinking

223
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:37,670
this is important and trying his best to reflect that in his own perspective.

224
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:48,820
The other things as far. All right.

225
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:57,220
I'm going to skip over like a couple minutes of section where they sort of went into lots of background stuff.

226
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:03,020
Honestly, I think that's one of the less valuable parts of the speech, but I'm not going to force you guys to listen to it.

227
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:11,030
Many dives into a section, really, about the vaccine, and that's the part that I want you to listen to and see how he's talking about that.

228
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:36,500
Act. The user interface on this thing is not.

229
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:51,770
Even if someone has mild illness, they can get vaccinated at that time.

230
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:58,430
The flu vaccination program for H1N1 is going to be challenging.

231
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:09,920
In a normal flu season with lots of time for preparation, when you're using decades of practice working with provider groups and others.

232
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:14,150
We vaccinate about 100 million people over about four months.

233
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:23,720
What we're looking at now is vaccinating as many people as want to be vaccinated in a shorter period of time as possible.

234
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:27,410
And there are enormous logistical challenges to doing that.

235
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:36,589
The production challenges of getting the vaccine out of the factory, the transportation challenges of getting it in controlled temperature.

236
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:43,550
Vehicles transported to warehouses and warehouses distributed along with needles,

237
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:49,520
syringes, another kit to about 90,000 locations throughout the United States.

238
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,580
We know that each state is different.

239
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:59,930
They'll have different strengths, different resources, different resources that they can call on to help with vaccination.

240
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:08,030
And we know also that misinformation spreads more rapidly even than the flu.

241
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:14,059
So any rumor had a risk of creating concern.

242
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:24,709
And we deal with that, right. In order to support a locality or even trial or vaccination program,

243
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:34,310
the federal government is providing nearly $1.5 billion to help with vaccine planning and administration is providing free vaccines.

244
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:38,930
And we will have enough vaccine for everyone who wants even.

245
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:41,600
We won't have it as soon as we'd like,

246
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:48,560
but we will eventually have enough vaccine for everyone and we're providing needles and all of the other equipment needed to vaccinate.

247
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:53,420
Technical support and guidance very quickly on the challenge here.

248
00:30:53,570 --> 00:31:01,640
And there was a choice to be made. And the dilemma, we have some vaccine coming in in early October.

249
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:09,499
Some of the early vaccine will be in mid to late October before we have any vaccine back up.

250
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:13,579
And we were out until we had enough to distribute substantial quantities

251
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:18,920
everywhere for getting it out as soon as it was available to us for distribution.

252
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:24,500
And we think the only right answer, the only ethical answer there is to get it out as rapidly as possible,

253
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:28,400
particularly since we have been spreading one.

254
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:37,320
What that means is that in the coming weeks there is going to be some rough it's going to be a little bumpy because in different states,

255
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:44,690
probably different levels of preparedness and readiness and planning and will undoubtedly be places where people want to get vaccinated.

256
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:51,829
And then in early to mid October particularly, that's a better option than just sitting on the vaccine.

257
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:55,360
It doesn't all come out in one big drop.

258
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:59,030
It comes out that's by about five different factories.

259
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:07,280
And we felt that the only responsible thing to do was to get that out rapidly and has comfortable knowing that that would mean that the

260
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:16,790
first couple of weeks of October are going to be running a bit rough in terms of there being a demand for vaccine that can't always be met.

261
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:22,399
We do know that by mid-to-late October there will be lots of vaccine available and that will

262
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:28,040
be continuing the substantial amount of the vaccine every week for the rest of the year.

263
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,380
We don't know what the other people think.

264
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:40,080
In the past, it's been difficult against people who clearly would benefit from vaccination, the environment.

265
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:47,190
And one of the challenges here is making sure that people who could benefit from it have every option of getting vaccinated,

266
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:52,800
because that's where we have of reducing the amount of illness and death from employment.

267
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:57,240
We also don't know which states are going to have particular problems.

268
00:32:57,270 --> 00:33:02,290
We're working very actively with state and localities to help them with preparation,

269
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:09,420
update their administrative difficulties or logistical technical difficulties to help them overcome.

270
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:14,310
The bottom line is that vaccination is our best to prevent flu.

271
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:18,690
That is very likely to be highly effective this year against H1N1.

272
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:23,790
We wish we had it sooner, but we ensure that all of this effort followed.

273
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:28,830
And given the technology that exists today, this is as fast as it can be produced.

274
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:32,070
It's particularly important for some groups.

275
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:38,340
We know that there will be differences between different states and how ready and the approach that they take.

276
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:45,150
That, for example, our planning very comprehensive school located vaccine program,

277
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:50,780
although they are in our planning, left extensive school located vaccination programs.

278
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:57,420
This is an unprecedented effort and we wish we had a more fully functioning system.

279
00:33:57,870 --> 00:34:00,900
That's not the easiest thing to have happen.

280
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:04,530
This is not an ideal time to have a pandemic.

281
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:10,439
We have a public health system that has adapted the underfunding and neglect.

282
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:16,230
And on top of that, the fiscal crisis has meant that there have been layoff furloughs,

283
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:20,910
hiring freezes, difficulties getting purchases and contracts in place.

284
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:26,819
And the health care system is not well set up to coordinate how information systems

285
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:32,160
that work particularly effectively or to prioritize prevention and vaccination.

286
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:36,570
It really isn't an ideal example of a preventive intervention.

287
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:44,020
It's going to be a busy and challenging few weeks. But the good news is we have a vaccine.

288
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:49,420
It's likely to be highly effective after a single dose for people eight and up.

289
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:57,129
And it's going to be rolling off the production lines, rolling into warehouses and from there into doctors offices,

290
00:34:57,130 --> 00:35:03,220
clinics and health departments to co-located vaccine program in the coming weeks.

291
00:35:04,090 --> 00:35:16,420
Thank you very much. All right. What was his tone about the vaccine rollout?

292
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:25,620
Yeah. He was kind of telling everyone to expect delays.

293
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:34,770
And due to the plane, we're getting the vaccine at my club, your staff, and then it's kind of going to look different everywhere.

294
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:46,470
So reinforcing this is not going to be a picnic and giving you some sense of why this is not we're not paying any attention to this.

295
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:53,010
This is we have production challenges, transportation challenges, implementation challenges, etc.

296
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:57,910
What else? Yeah, I think it's a really good.

297
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:02,179
And expectations to us.

298
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:09,200
Like you kind of mentions how many vaccine guys are going to arrive, when it's going to arrive, and where the public's going to get it.

299
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:14,569
And notice that he keeps reinforcing, even as he's saying, look,

300
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:19,700
there isn't necessarily going to be places where somebody in early October is

301
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:22,880
going to be more people who want to vaccine and there will be a vaccine available.

302
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:26,270
He's also saying we will have enough vaccine for everybody.

303
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:36,880
It just won't happen immediately. So that that balance of you may face a barrier, but we guarantee we're going to get it to you eventually.

304
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:41,670
Is a key part of that overall message? Well, yeah.

305
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:46,070
He basically explained that there was a dilemma and like both sides of the

306
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:50,340
dilemma in terms of it should sit on the shelf or redistributing right away.

307
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,030
Yeah. And I really like he was very blunt about that.

308
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:58,100
I mean, he used the word dilemma. And.

309
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:05,269
What I appreciate about it is it is it owning that they are responsible for

310
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:09,050
creating the experience of somebody not getting a vaccine when they want it?

311
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:16,010
Because they could have avoided that by stacking the stuff in warehouses until they could get enough to deliver it out.

312
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:24,320
And they said, no, we're not going to do that. And here's why you may still be upset because that could happen to you, but that was intentional.

313
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:29,200
I really appreciate appreciated that of. What else?

314
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:37,730
Yeah. I think it's just more about choice of content.

315
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:44,580
I think like even though he's like foreseeing all of the future challenges, mentioning them a lot, it kind of drags down,

316
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:51,490
but it shows a lot of like foresight, which I think is reassuring that his team uses, like we statements a lot.

317
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:58,270
This team has obviously thought through all of this, like they've got it under control, you know, and that's his job like that.

318
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:05,030
It's interesting you say they've got it under control. I don't think they would say they've got it under control.

319
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:09,920
What they've got is an awareness of all the things that are likely going to have to be fixed.

320
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:17,650
And that's an important distinction. They're not saying everything's going to be fine, but they are saying, yes, we are.

321
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:25,540
Let us show you all the way as we are anticipating all the things that we are paying attention to, all the challenges that we've identified.

322
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:31,989
To show you that we're working on it. And that's a key distinction in a crisis context.

323
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:35,230
Like you don't have to solve everything.

324
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:42,070
Audiences want is to believe that those who can do something are doing things.

325
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:49,340
So when he's talking about transportation challenges, people are like, Oh man, I never thought about that.

326
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:53,360
I never thought about the fact that have to ship this stuff all over the place.

327
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:57,920
Yeah, that would be hard. And, you know.

328
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:06,080
When we I mean, just reflect on your own experiences about the discussions about supply chain issues.

329
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:14,790
Like I remember going to the grocery store a year ago and like there were these body parts in this like no soup here, no race there kind of stuff.

330
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:20,760
And because it was sort of owned as a larger like everybody's basically supply chain issues.

331
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:25,470
I was like, okay, I'm not actually mad at the grocery store. I know they wanted.

332
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,620
They're trying to get it. This is a problem.

333
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:35,870
And so my tolerance for that experience of not being able to get the things that I want was a whole lot better than it would have been otherwise.

334
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:41,470
And that's what he's trying to prevent in this context, is that experience of people saying, what?

335
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:49,030
I want this. How come you haven't. Don't have it for me. And he's already giving you the answer of why I don't have it for you.

336
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:58,649
The other things from this one? Yeah, I'm kind of kind of an underhanded way.

337
00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:06,959
He explained the kind of overarching public health, kind of underfunding problems as a kind of way to say,

338
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,410
I mean, this is explicitly saying this is kind of what happened to me,

339
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:17,190
invest in this stuff for decades and, you know, thinking about the future probably of we to get scared by this crisis,

340
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:22,770
then we can maybe, you know, put the system better. And if you think about his larger goals.

341
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:29,980
He's basically saying if you don't like where things are, let's recognize that.

342
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:35,320
All the things that led us to where we are here. You want to prevent this for the next one?

343
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:43,930
Start funding us for the next one. And some of that's pointed at some of that's just acknowledging that.

344
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:47,920
I mean, this is 2009 2008 was a major financial crisis.

345
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:50,910
But that's not his fault.

346
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:59,410
But it is absolutely part of the context of what had happened to, you know, the country as a whole, but along the public health system.

347
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:04,750
And by acknowledging that, he said, look. It's going to be hard because of that.

348
00:41:06,350 --> 00:41:15,399
Any other stuff on this one? But it's also important how he addressed terms of like, for example, misinformation,

349
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:22,400
that now obviously there's going to be stuff going around that they have absolutely no control over that.

350
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:34,680
There's components that is the general populations impact that saying sorry, but this isn't something that we can manage.

351
00:41:34,690 --> 00:41:39,400
Right. Well, and it's again, it is in some sense.

352
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:47,650
As much as a lot of this speech is about saying what they've done, I think there's a lot of humility.

353
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:52,040
It's a lot of descriptions of ways in which there are limits to what they're able to do.

354
00:41:52,850 --> 00:41:58,310
And this information is one of those like, look, we're going to do our best to provide you with good information.

355
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:04,220
And we know that misinformation spreads really fast, and we're going to have to try to our best to deal with that.

356
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:13,220
It doesn't take uptake of you know so come to us because we are the best source of I go there.

357
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:19,070
He's letting the fact that he's providing good information say that rather than.

358
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:24,840
Pushing that message. Any other thoughts on this one?

359
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:27,640
All right.

360
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:38,000
So I was just thinking he kind of gives industry updates, most of which, like, we won't be doing, I guess, because we're doing like a local over.

361
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:44,630
No, but you can think about there are times when what you are reporting isn't coming from you,

362
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:49,040
it's coming from CDC or it's coming from a hospital or it's coming from the school system.

363
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:58,490
Like, so he's talking at the national level. So when he was talking about school based vaccination programs, you know,

364
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:03,140
he had some variances like, well, some places are going to do a lot of school schools. Some places are going to do less in the schools.

365
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:10,430
So, again, sort of acknowledging the fact he's not running those programs, but he is serving as the conduit for that information.

366
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:18,290
And then similarly in your speech, you're going to be serving as a conduit for information that may be coming from other sources as you write it up.

367
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:23,740
Again, I have left a lot of flexibility in terms of how you describe the given situation.

368
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:35,330
All right. So. I like that particular speech a lot because it manifests a number of the things that we talked about in the last class.

369
00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:43,350
Let's talk a little bit about some of the other ones that you ran and the ways in which they either did or did not do that.

370
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:54,090
And the first ones I want to start with is that we started with relatively good examples that sort of work from better examples to less good examples.

371
00:43:56,100 --> 00:44:01,740
Several of you talked about the speeches from Prime Minister.

372
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:06,600
I can never pronounce your name. Yes.

373
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:11,460
Harder and harder. Thank you. From New Zealand and.

374
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:17,720
I remember. Hearing these reports when?

375
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:19,910
In March and April like.

376
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:29,790
Why there was so much frustration about the U.S. and the U.K. and many other industrialized countries and how, you know, nobody is doing this right.

377
00:44:29,870 --> 00:44:39,450
Sort of like, wait. New Zealand's got this right. And so I went looking for the speeches and thought, you know, chase them down and.

378
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:43,720
Brought that to you guys because I think they have some really interesting perspectives.

379
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:49,460
So. What I want to start. Emma.

380
00:44:50,930 --> 00:44:56,900
You were talking about, particularly the language I kind of down that sort of the united front idea.

381
00:44:58,230 --> 00:45:01,620
So talk about sort of what you picked up as you were reading about that. Yeah.

382
00:45:01,710 --> 00:45:10,290
So I just thought I had like a tone of like sharing the concerns with the people versus being separate from the problem.

383
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:19,590
And so they were talking about, oh, how we want you to be involved in this to help not only like the public health crisis,

384
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:28,350
but also to help your fellow people. So that, like you mentioned something about, well, they don't want us on the ground of New Zealand.

385
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:34,800
And so I thought that was kind of interesting and took a different ones and I thought like we as Americans.

386
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:39,990
So I don't know how much to attribute this to to French national culture.

387
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:50,370
It certainly is representative of the idea that in this kind of especially in that moment, the prime minister is not removed from the crisis.

388
00:45:50,370 --> 00:45:56,880
They are just as much a citizen of the country as somebody who is personally concerned about it, etc., as anybody else.

389
00:45:57,570 --> 00:46:02,430
And that's reflected in the tone and the language we use there.

390
00:46:02,430 --> 00:46:07,110
Something like this is a common problem we're all facing together.

391
00:46:07,110 --> 00:46:13,860
We need to present to prevent. These are not to present a united front.

392
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:22,090
Which is an approach to oratory that is not commonly done in public health.

393
00:46:23,210 --> 00:46:33,680
When do we usually hear that kind of language? One prototypical situation.

394
00:46:34,510 --> 00:46:48,169
What? And I'll come back to that question in terms of metaphor and emotion and a little bit, but that kind of we are all in this together.

395
00:46:48,170 --> 00:46:53,690
This is our national identity. We have to work together. We have to present a united front against the enemy.

396
00:46:53,690 --> 00:47:03,440
Kind of language is now being applied in a health crisis because it's evoking the same kind of supporting each other.

397
00:47:03,830 --> 00:47:08,240
Everyone must contribute kind of idea. Yeah.

398
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:12,059
Yeah. I think it was kind of reminding me of like honestly like speeches from my church,

399
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:18,440
Hillary when like Bush in 2001 because like the real emphasis on like it's us against the like.

400
00:47:19,470 --> 00:47:24,480
Well, I think he was really effective in the speech actually like for like having a little bit of like emotional there and garnering.

401
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:29,790
Um, uh, I also thought it was really effective and like she described, like,

402
00:47:29,790 --> 00:47:36,070
here's, here's what our goals are for the future, like the next coming months. But also here's what's happening right now within the next 48 hours.

403
00:47:36,090 --> 00:47:41,050
Like, uh, like she made that distinction between, like, the story right now and in the future.

404
00:47:41,070 --> 00:47:45,100
Yeah. And that, that various I mean,

405
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:52,880
part of this is I happen to pick the ones that were happening right at that crisis moment when she's announcing policies that will be implemented in,

406
00:47:53,050 --> 00:47:56,820
in a matter of days. Um, but you're right.

407
00:47:56,850 --> 00:48:00,570
Notice the key piece of this is that's when the uncertainty is the worst.

408
00:48:00,630 --> 00:48:04,500
That's when the. What is this going to mean to me? Kind of feeling is the worst.

409
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:09,840
So the concreteness of here's what's going to happen and here's what you got to do,

410
00:48:10,830 --> 00:48:15,470
be is answering the questions that most of her citizens were facing at that moment.

411
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:21,480
Absolutely. That's she.

412
00:48:23,190 --> 00:48:26,980
That's Toronto area.

413
00:48:28,770 --> 00:48:36,330
One of the things I saw in your musing about the speeches was the emphasis on things are going to get worse before they get better.

414
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:43,090
And so anything you want to elaborate to that? Because I think that's another one of the key things that she does really well.

415
00:48:43,390 --> 00:48:51,190
Yeah, I don't have the money, you know, but I think she just like literally said in the speech, things are going to get better.

416
00:48:51,190 --> 00:48:53,169
Everything is going to get worse before they get better.

417
00:48:53,170 --> 00:49:01,090
And I'm just like setting that up because like she mentioned that it's already the virus is already in the community.

418
00:49:01,090 --> 00:49:04,810
So we're going to start seeing it go up even though like you're isolated.

419
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:10,450
So like be prepared to see numbers go up even though.

420
00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:14,500
Right. So even before they go back down because of the isolation.

421
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:22,300
And the key thing I want to notice here is let's imagine for the moment she was wrong,

422
00:49:22,810 --> 00:49:26,020
that things in fact, all of their measures were going to work so well.

423
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:27,640
Things would start to get better immediately.

424
00:49:28,330 --> 00:49:37,450
Everybody had been upset by the fact that nobody would have been upset by that, the fact that she said it's going to get worse before they get better.

425
00:49:37,450 --> 00:49:42,820
And if they start to get better really fast, everybody's like, Yes, this is great.

426
00:49:43,270 --> 00:49:50,500
But notice the reverse is not true. If you say things are going to start to get better and they don't, you're in deep trouble.

427
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:59,970
So again, facing the uncertainty, framing the worst case scenario, and helping people anticipate that things are going to get worse.

428
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:09,770
Wins no matter what think happens. Like if you're accurate, that you're accurate, if things turn out better, everybody's happy.

429
00:50:10,850 --> 00:50:14,659
And that's a key thing that most people tend to get wrong in these kinds of contexts,

430
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:19,760
because they want to reassure, they want to say, Oh, they're imagining the positive.

431
00:50:20,270 --> 00:50:24,979
And the challenge in these kinds of situations is you've got to make sure that everybody is imagining the non positive,

432
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:34,770
the worst and anticipating that. So I just want to set up a brief contrast.

433
00:50:34,950 --> 00:50:40,700
So. If the prime minister says things are going to get worse before they get better.

434
00:50:41,670 --> 00:50:48,510
Audrey Thomas I think my favorite quote from it, and it's like, you need to relax.

435
00:50:48,510 --> 00:50:51,660
Like, This is going to be fine. I'm a New Yorker, but it's like we're all good.

436
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:58,140
But then he, like, goes out of his way to be like, Oh, if you're immunocompromised or have a disability, like, you're going to die.

437
00:50:58,620 --> 00:51:06,550
It just is what it is. So it was just weird that he's over reassuring everyone, but then like going out of his way to say, like, No, I'm not you.

438
00:51:06,570 --> 00:51:09,690
Like, you're not real New Yorkers, apparently. So.

439
00:51:10,850 --> 00:51:15,590
I think the core from my perspective is the overreaching anybody.

440
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:22,720
Like the problem he's left with is he knows he can't actually guarantee that everybody is going to be fine.

441
00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:29,100
And so when he takes this tone of, you know, this is good, we should just relax.

442
00:51:29,110 --> 00:51:32,470
We've got lots of experience in dealing with crises and things like that.

443
00:51:32,770 --> 00:51:38,220
Then he's got to sort of slip in this. Yeah, but really, there's going to be some people who are not going to be okay.

444
00:51:38,230 --> 00:51:41,530
So boom, here you are. You know, you're on your own kind of a tone.

445
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:46,060
I mean, it's it's problematic in both at multiple levels.

446
00:51:46,450 --> 00:51:50,500
But I really want to highlight this contrast. Like it's going to get worse.

447
00:51:50,530 --> 00:51:59,710
No, it's going to be get better. But the same moment like these speeches were two weeks apart, basically three weeks apart.

448
00:52:00,790 --> 00:52:04,570
And yeah, three weeks was a big by the time at that like there were things evolving but.

449
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:07,510
There was no reason why.

450
00:52:08,870 --> 00:52:16,549
Cuomo should have had any kind of anticipation of it was going to be under control even at that stage like you had seen spread.

451
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:22,190
And even if you. Even if you. Have great confidence in your public health system's ability.

452
00:52:22,730 --> 00:52:29,390
As Dr. Frieden mentioned, we're talking about viruses that change, that evolve, etc.

453
00:52:29,450 --> 00:52:36,830
There's lots of unpredictability. Yeah, it's just funny because like, I remember during that time and I might remember it, but I feel like.

454
00:52:37,770 --> 00:52:41,009
People were really like Cuomo during that time.

455
00:52:41,010 --> 00:52:46,620
Like people were like, wow, he's doing so good and like addressing COVID and everything.

456
00:52:46,710 --> 00:52:55,670
So, so let's talk about his speech because you can find the seeds of that positive framing in his speech,

457
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:59,430
even though we can look at it now and say, Matt, he was a reassuring.

458
00:53:01,230 --> 00:53:07,050
What did Cuomo do in that speech that gave people some degree of connection to it?

459
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:14,129
Yeah, he mentioned his daughter right at the beginning, saying, like, I understand your anxiety.

460
00:53:14,130 --> 00:53:17,430
My daughter just called me the other day and I can hear the anxiety in her voice.

461
00:53:17,430 --> 00:53:25,919
But all of it's like, I understand. So on an empathy level, I think Cuomo's speech does a decent amount of positive things.

462
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:30,900
Like she acknowledges that fear is a part of this moment.

463
00:53:31,990 --> 00:53:37,030
Through talking about his conversation with his daughter. He doesn't say his daughter's stupid.

464
00:53:37,990 --> 00:53:42,580
He frames his daughter like, okay, you're this is I understand where you're coming from.

465
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:56,050
Let's talk about this. In so doing, he's also personal in the sense that he is not Governor Cuomo in that moment, he's dead.

466
00:53:58,220 --> 00:54:05,040
And. That, too, was part of this when no one else was talking at a human level.

467
00:54:06,890 --> 00:54:11,299
Even somebody who was all very reassuring, at least was doing so in a way of like,

468
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:15,230
Yeah, I'm human, I'm worried about this, my daughter is worried about this, etc.

469
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:20,480
So on that level, I give Cuomo some credit.

470
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:24,890
He spoke to the emotions of the moment, to the fears of the moment.

471
00:54:25,820 --> 00:54:32,870
I think you send the wrong message to those. But but he's at least acknowledging that, whereas so many others in that moment were basically.

472
00:54:34,450 --> 00:54:39,700
Essentially saying, why would anybody be afraid now? And that's.

473
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:47,060
Always going to get a negative reaction. So what?

474
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:50,300
We're talking about this. What else did you take away from Cuomo's speech?

475
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:54,230
So there was the daughter section. Other things.

476
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:59,190
Yeah. He kept talking about the Sox. Yeah.

477
00:54:59,670 --> 00:55:05,610
Yeah. So, like, it's kind of like up to him, he said in the situation with facts to fear.

478
00:55:05,620 --> 00:55:09,170
Then he also said, I guess the emotion. I understand it, I understand it.

479
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:14,310
Anxiety. I'm a native Yorker. We live in the city, but the facts don't back it up here.

480
00:55:14,970 --> 00:55:19,500
So I felt like he also was kind of dismissing that emotions of like having fear.

481
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:23,610
Like he kind of said like, oh, I understand it with his daughter's situation.

482
00:55:23,610 --> 00:55:26,730
But then he said, like, the facts don't back it up, so don't worry about it.

483
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:28,920
Yeah. So I'm glad you brought that up.

484
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:36,360
And, and I had particularly wanted to make sure to get to what you did highlighted because I want to say this to you guys.

485
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:46,490
But facts never defeat you. Remember the beginning of this course.

486
00:55:47,670 --> 00:55:52,380
We talked about cognition as separate from emotion and experience.

487
00:55:54,550 --> 00:56:01,450
This is that dilemma. Again, facts are a cognition or three details of the facts.

488
00:56:01,450 --> 00:56:07,030
And they can be right. They can be wrong. And there were plain ways in which a description of the facts was not necessarily right.

489
00:56:08,390 --> 00:56:12,590
But just like when you talked about at the beginning of the course,

490
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:21,560
you can have all the cognition you want and still have experimental learning and still have emotion and still have that feeling simultaneously.

491
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:27,720
Cuomo's problem is he believes that the emotions will be just completely wiped out by providing enough facts.

492
00:56:28,450 --> 00:56:37,339
And especially in a crisis. The answer is you have to speak to the emotions, period, the alleged facts you give people.

493
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:41,240
You have to address and acknowledge and speak to those emotions.

494
00:56:43,170 --> 00:56:51,500
And that, I think is in many ways almost fatal flaw in this speech is that his his mindset is all I have to do is give people the facts.

495
00:56:51,530 --> 00:56:54,600
The facts will win and they won't be afraid and then I'm done.

496
00:56:55,230 --> 00:56:58,710
So even when he is acknowledging that they have emotion, which is a good thing.

497
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:05,240
In some sense, he's kind of dismissing it because his model is all I have to do is give you facts.

498
00:57:05,930 --> 00:57:13,760
Whereas an examined Bible is not. What I have to do is start by acknowledging and validating all of your emotions.

499
00:57:14,090 --> 00:57:20,900
You are normal to feel this way. And now let's share this experience together.

500
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:27,430
Yeah. I think what's interesting to me is that he says that the facts that support that but then you start to like.

501
00:57:29,110 --> 00:57:38,090
Dismissing the only essential modeling data they had by saying that we're extrapolating from what happened in China, that what really happened here.

502
00:57:38,110 --> 00:57:44,410
So it's like if that is the facts and then he like removes himself from that and like, what are the facts?

503
00:57:44,430 --> 00:57:45,640
It's kind of what I felt.

504
00:57:46,270 --> 00:57:53,890
Well, and this to me falls under the old reassuring piece in the sense that he's not actually able to bring scientific facts.

505
00:57:55,340 --> 00:58:00,200
They make a coherent, logical argument to back up his statement that everything would be fine.

506
00:58:01,070 --> 00:58:09,130
But what? That's what he wants to say. So he says it. And then he basically dismisses the the possibility that the data suggest would match

507
00:58:09,410 --> 00:58:13,490
that from China or from other places would have to the experience in New York.

508
00:58:17,030 --> 00:58:29,209
Yeah. And he also like does talk about how like there will be more in case like he doesn't dismiss that like prices are going to go down like say,

509
00:58:29,210 --> 00:58:32,360
like things are going. Not in the same phrasing.

510
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:39,110
But he does say that like admittedly there will be more cases and it's not like a question of if,

511
00:58:39,110 --> 00:58:42,440
but when and then like talks about how the goal is containment.

512
00:58:42,770 --> 00:58:48,800
Right. And notice to set the contrast here and I haven't given you anything else from the US context at that moment in time,

513
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:57,650
but my recollection of what you were getting at that moment from the US government, from State Government, was basically this is going to go away.

514
00:58:58,310 --> 00:59:04,250
And he's not saying you said it's going to be containment, which we're going to see more, it's going to be a battle.

515
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:11,120
We're going have to work on this. He's overconfident in his ability to win that battle, but he's acknowledging that it's going to be about.

516
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:18,440
And so, I mean, honestly, looking back historically now with two years worth of perspective.

517
00:59:20,210 --> 00:59:26,660
My take on it is Cuomo did some good things, but it's a bad thing that he came across better than he was because the contrast to what

518
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:32,090
elder messages were out there was so sharp because the rest of the message was so horrible.

519
00:59:35,130 --> 00:59:40,590
And that's why I wanted to give you the stuff from New Zealand to anchor you on the other end like it could be done.

520
00:59:40,590 --> 00:59:45,730
Well, it wasn't. Something like good stuff.

521
00:59:45,770 --> 00:59:51,710
There was some positive stuff. There was some negative stuff. We can unpack it in detail, etc., but.

522
00:59:52,790 --> 00:59:56,870
Part of the reason he came across a well was he was at least willing to talk to people like people.

523
00:59:57,790 --> 01:00:02,060
Which wasn't really what we were hearing from most of the other sources of information.

524
01:00:08,740 --> 01:00:18,490
While we're on this topic. Let's talk about metaphor.

525
01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:24,340
And Sydney, you were the one who I think talked about this the most in your music.

526
01:00:25,090 --> 01:00:30,440
You noticed, though, that all type of language popping up in multiple places.

527
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:36,610
So what else did you want to bring up from that? And I think you summarize it pretty well.

528
01:00:36,790 --> 01:00:45,730
I just like a lot of times languages to talk about words use like to talk about COVID 19 to combat COVID or COVID the invisible enemy.

529
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:51,400
Fight against COVID and combat. So.

530
01:00:53,770 --> 01:01:04,620
Is the battle metaphor helpful? Well, we're both, you know, something like this kind of kind of talking about an infectious disease.

531
01:01:04,650 --> 01:01:11,220
Yeah, it's an infectious disease. I wanted to compare it to the cancer.

532
01:01:11,730 --> 01:01:18,180
Yes. So let's look at arguably you take the cancer one and then we'll come back and do the comparison,

533
01:01:18,180 --> 01:01:20,160
because I think there is an important question to ask.

534
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:26,459
It's not that it's necessarily always good to always bad, but we have to think about how does it apply to a particular health context.

535
01:01:26,460 --> 01:01:31,380
So the cancer context, we also we certainly hear militaristic metaphors in the cancer.

536
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:42,299
And I think it's really tricky because you really do want to have social support when these things are happening and like a sense of camaraderie.

537
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:46,950
And it helps people get through a really tough time, which Komen was.

538
01:01:47,820 --> 01:01:56,310
But it does frame like the people who don't make it through is losers basically lost the fight,

539
01:01:56,550 --> 01:02:02,010
that type of language versus winners, I guess, who survive.

540
01:02:02,190 --> 01:02:07,650
And it's what it really comes down to, you know, loss a lot of the time.

541
01:02:09,090 --> 01:02:11,070
So, I don't know. It's very tricky.

542
01:02:12,170 --> 01:02:21,380
It's useful, I think, like when we're talking about, you know, banding together the way Governor Whitmer did a lot, but.

543
01:02:22,410 --> 01:02:33,870
It's harmful when, you know, people are experiencing a lot of losses, even though they've taken all of the necessary steps to you now.

544
01:02:37,330 --> 01:02:41,620
I'm trying to be descriptive without framing this as good or bad.

545
01:02:42,370 --> 01:02:49,430
Then I notice that when we talk about. Battle in The New York Times is context.

546
01:02:50,740 --> 01:02:59,770
There are similar issues that arise. Not everyone who is affected by war essentially deserves it.

547
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:04,879
Not everybody is a combatant. You know, there are certainly random components in terms of who's lives and who survived.

548
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:15,720
That's not driven by somebody's skill. Some of the key components of that metaphor that we have to think about is so you

549
01:03:15,740 --> 01:03:18,800
get to sort of like who sort of lives and survives is winning versus losing.

550
01:03:22,510 --> 01:03:25,570
So what does that imply about the concept of surrender?

551
01:03:30,190 --> 01:03:35,070
Does the militaristic metaphor keep us fighting?

552
01:03:35,180 --> 01:03:41,560
I continue to use the language here to emphasize this despite overwhelming odds.

553
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:50,700
Does it inhibit our ability to minimize collateral damage and in.

554
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:56,810
A war context once often surrenders to limit the harm that will occur.

555
01:04:00,260 --> 01:04:03,530
We talk about cancer, does that mean you get that you're surrendering?

556
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:11,540
If you say, no, I don't want any more chemo. Are we surrendering if we stop wearing our masks or are we surrendering?

557
01:04:11,570 --> 01:04:16,820
If we go to up to dinner in a restaurant as opposed to staying at home.

558
01:04:17,150 --> 01:04:26,000
Like how does the militaristic metaphor change our beliefs about the acceptability or not acceptability of different types of actions?

559
01:04:28,100 --> 01:04:31,520
That's a big picture question. So we touch on touch to upon it briefly.

560
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:36,460
Now I have a whole day in my other class where we talk about force and the way in which they influence.

561
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:41,390
So there's actually an interesting literature about the.

562
01:04:43,030 --> 01:04:48,970
Pros and cons of the way we use militaristic metaphors in health contexts.

563
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:58,780
And particularly, it seems to have distinctions between prevention contexts and treatment contexts that in.

564
01:05:00,830 --> 01:05:05,360
Treatment context where there is a thing that is already causing harm.

565
01:05:05,790 --> 01:05:12,149
We can. Apply the the the battle metaphor with one set of implications.

566
01:05:12,150 --> 01:05:18,380
But when we're talking about you know. But the language of a war against obesity.

567
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:23,510
It doesn't fit the same way.

568
01:05:25,910 --> 01:05:33,500
So anyway, this is a somewhat of a tangent from the speech piece, but it absolutely comes up in many of the speeches and crises context.

569
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:37,820
People naturally fall into using that metal militaristic metaphor.

570
01:05:38,940 --> 01:05:41,390
So I'm glad it's being brought up here and pay attention to it.

571
01:05:42,290 --> 01:05:48,199
Are I think the term frontline workers in particular seemed really interesting to me as

572
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:54,170
like just that always felt sort of militaristic but also a little like sacrificial almost.

573
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:59,300
And it was, you know, an optional label. No, it wasn't.

574
01:06:00,890 --> 01:06:08,610
And. And we think about, well, this is a tangent and I don't want to go too far down down it, but.

575
01:06:10,010 --> 01:06:24,730
Think about the language of heroes. Both from the standpoint of workers and from the standpoint of how we attach emotion to those who do not survive.

576
01:06:27,190 --> 01:06:31,900
And a in a military context, we might.

577
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:36,480
Label, someone who dies in combat as a hero.

578
01:06:36,900 --> 01:06:43,960
Do we do so to someone who died of COVID? Does that change as they were vaccinated or not?

579
01:06:45,150 --> 01:06:53,670
Like all of these metaphors, change the emotional meaning that we attach to outcomes.

580
01:06:54,650 --> 01:06:58,860
And so we can use them. Consciously.

581
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:02,459
But we should be aware of when we're using them and why we're using them.

582
01:07:02,460 --> 01:07:09,990
Because they come along with a lot of baggage. Last thoughts on this phone call were here.

583
01:07:15,980 --> 01:07:23,660
Couple other things I want to make sure to get to. I did that.

584
01:07:23,980 --> 01:07:29,160
You? Was.

585
01:07:31,570 --> 01:07:34,860
We're talking about white and right.

586
01:07:37,140 --> 01:07:43,200
I think so. So I take these really brief notes and maybe I didn't capture it,

587
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:47,280
but I think what I thought you were talking about, which is something I do want to talk about, is.

588
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:52,700
I give you the speeches from like March of 2020.

589
01:07:54,090 --> 01:08:00,150
We're still in a pandemic, but it's two and a half years later, like we're in a different moment.

590
01:08:00,630 --> 01:08:04,260
And I seem to remember you were sort of somehow talking about that issue.

591
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:13,690
Yeah, that. I just saw the news the other day that the U.S. declared that we're still in a public health emergency.

592
01:08:14,920 --> 01:08:20,200
And I saw a lot of bad reactions to that because it's been true with the normal lives that it is.

593
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:26,550
It doesn't seem like an emergency anymore. It feels like we're still in crisis mode.

594
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:30,370
We're not in crisis mode. Yeah. And it's really confusing.

595
01:08:30,530 --> 01:08:34,599
Yeah, everyone. And that's what I wanted to make sure to bring up is yeah,

596
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:43,600
it is really confusing because there are ways in which this moment in time is still has uncertainty,

597
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:46,960
still has emotions, still has some of these characteristics of a crisis.

598
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:50,800
On the other hand, we've been at this for two and a half years.

599
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:57,070
Remember that? That cross diagram about know, known versus unknown we have moved from.

600
01:08:57,130 --> 01:09:01,570
We know nothing about coal, but we have been bombarded with COVID information for years.

601
01:09:02,020 --> 01:09:08,260
We know a lot like it's not going to evoke the same level of reaction to enact as it once did.

602
01:09:09,290 --> 01:09:14,540
And much of what was going on now is at least as much a battle of.

603
01:09:15,580 --> 01:09:21,420
Can I still keep doing this as it is getting me to do something new and I will on that.

604
01:09:21,430 --> 01:09:29,919
I was just at a party last night at a club and I was wrestling consciously with

605
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:34,330
the do I really need to keep wearing my mask in this moment kind of stuff?

606
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:42,940
Which is emblematic of this this sort of like is it still a crisis kind of feeling?

607
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:53,250
And by the way, the same thing exists in countries that are in in face conflicts over long periods of time.

608
01:09:53,430 --> 01:10:01,020
I mean, if you think about what was it like in the in a country at war in the first two weeks?

609
01:10:01,140 --> 01:10:09,510
I mean, let's use the current experience of Ukraine in the first two weeks of the war versus Ukraine now.

610
01:10:09,510 --> 01:10:11,879
Now, I think they're still fairly clearly in crisis.

611
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:17,880
But as this keeps going on over years of time, as certainly have occurred in other countries around the world,

612
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:27,150
how you go back to going to the and explain what's going on because life goes on.

613
01:10:27,750 --> 01:10:34,170
So I don't have a simple answer, but yes, I wanted to make sure to bring that up because the tension between what you say

614
01:10:34,170 --> 01:10:38,250
in a crisis and the reality that we're sort of normalizing is a very real.

615
01:10:40,110 --> 01:10:45,540
The other thing I really to to bring up is.

616
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:50,630
Most of the examples we've talked about are sort of external crises.

617
01:10:51,470 --> 01:10:57,800
There's a flu, there's a war, there's a contamination kind of thing.

618
01:10:58,500 --> 01:11:04,730
But there is another really critical type of crisis and a particular type of speech that we need to acknowledge, which is.

619
01:11:05,770 --> 01:11:08,800
The error situation.

620
01:11:08,980 --> 01:11:12,420
Somebody screwed up. Something went wrong.

621
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:22,320
You are responsible for it. It is the fault of your organization or you as an individual, etc.

622
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:26,340
And this is a crisis. So hospital errors.

623
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:39,889
Product defects. When I think about a public health example rollout of the polio vaccine, where some of the vaccine was not involved,

624
01:11:39,890 --> 01:11:45,530
it was called the cutter incident in which the vaccine gave polio to a thousands of people.

625
01:11:46,460 --> 01:11:53,310
And that's a public health crisis. But it's not. H1N1 influenza influence are well covered.

626
01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:57,100
It's. The system failed and we've harmed people.

627
01:11:59,610 --> 01:12:02,850
So let's apply this for the moment to that kind of a situation.

628
01:12:03,660 --> 01:12:09,510
What do we know and what would be sort of the most critical things to do in that kind of context?

629
01:12:14,070 --> 01:12:23,850
Yeah. Knowledge that you messed up. Yeah. So the parallel here of sort of the bad news first is the we screwed up.

630
01:12:25,090 --> 01:12:29,390
Yes. It happened. Yes, it was bad. Yes, it was our responsibility.

631
01:12:29,410 --> 01:12:32,810
Yes, it's our fault. That.

632
01:12:34,260 --> 01:12:38,900
Doesn't often happen, but when it does, it has the same implications in terms of.

633
01:12:39,970 --> 01:12:44,990
You get the worst of it outright right from the start, and then you can begin to work with people about it.

634
01:12:46,390 --> 01:12:50,450
You know, I don't think it's relevant. All right. And other thoughts.

635
01:12:50,900 --> 01:12:56,540
Things that have come up in the context of this section on what would you do if you were, in fact, were the cause of the problem?

636
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:07,940
So I'll highlight a few. The personal.

637
01:13:10,890 --> 01:13:19,680
You're going to be upset in that moment. You can't come across like, okay, that's not going to play well.

638
01:13:21,310 --> 01:13:30,010
Nor can you come across like, yeah, this doesn't matter to me. But if you or your organization screwed up, you should be affected by it.

639
01:13:30,010 --> 01:13:39,950
And that needs to come out in that context. Think about the uncertainty here.

640
01:13:40,250 --> 01:13:45,770
So we spent a lot of time things today talking about what we don't know.

641
01:13:45,770 --> 01:13:52,790
Things could change. This could turn out to be worse before it's going to get better, etc. in parallel in an error situation is.

642
01:13:54,190 --> 01:13:57,190
We don't know how many people have been affected. We're going to find out.

643
01:13:58,090 --> 01:14:02,110
We're going to try and make it right as best as possible. We're going to, etc.

644
01:14:02,380 --> 01:14:11,790
You don't know how bad it is in that first moment. Even if it's something as simple as you know.

645
01:14:13,260 --> 01:14:15,870
A mistake in the O.R. that has killed one patient.

646
01:14:17,680 --> 01:14:26,020
Really underneath that is the question as it killed any others, is this is this one of a pattern like we don't know and you better acknowledge that,

647
01:14:26,020 --> 01:14:32,050
because if it turns out there's another one or there's some systematic problem and you haven't acknowledged that right from the start,

648
01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:35,530
you have just killed trust in an organization.

649
01:14:36,780 --> 01:14:42,300
What role does scapegoating play in this situation?

650
01:14:43,540 --> 01:14:50,520
And so that's a complicated question, and I don't have time to dive into it, and I certainly don't know that I'm an expert in it.

651
01:14:51,660 --> 01:14:54,810
My first gut reaction says there's a difference between.

652
01:14:57,570 --> 01:15:01,559
Accepting the global responsibility of this is a bad thing.

653
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:06,780
And it has happened. And. Let me. Let me. Present the worst news upfront.

654
01:15:07,930 --> 01:15:11,650
And assigning the specific blame for its costs.

655
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:17,500
And the analogy they're going to draw here is the processes used for managing hospital errors, at least here,

656
01:15:17,740 --> 01:15:25,510
in the sense of you draw the distinction between, yes, we, the system are responsible for this error.

657
01:15:26,350 --> 01:15:30,669
We regret this. This is not okay. We want to you want to make it as right as possible.

658
01:15:30,670 --> 01:15:35,910
We want to find out why this has happened. And you separate that from the.

659
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:45,900
This particular individual or this particular thing. Fosters So yeah, I will pick on an example that comes to mind.

660
01:15:45,930 --> 01:15:53,070
You know, the nurse administered a ten times dose of what they should have gotten and caused a death.

661
01:15:53,820 --> 01:15:58,010
Well, okay. So there is clearly a nurse who was the actor. But how was that label?

662
01:15:58,020 --> 01:16:01,470
How was that instruction passed down? How overworked were they?

663
01:16:01,620 --> 01:16:04,380
All of these other systemic factors are certainly real.

664
01:16:05,130 --> 01:16:14,130
And when you start from the perspective of saying we are responsible, then you move away from pinning that on one person and you say, this is this.

665
01:16:14,220 --> 01:16:17,850
We have a larger responsibility. All right.

666
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:23,879
So in the last few minutes, I do want to have you talk a little bit about the stuff that's up on the board and really just wrestle

667
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:29,240
with this question of we've talked a lot about speeches in situations like Confederate flags.

668
01:16:29,890 --> 01:16:36,600
What does this tell us about other situations? So I brought up the medical error example, but we want to.

669
01:16:38,380 --> 01:16:44,830
Think about obesity or opioids or, you know,

670
01:16:45,010 --> 01:16:51,580
water quality or water contamination like these are widespread things that we want to motivate people to take seriously.

671
01:16:52,180 --> 01:16:57,070
Are there things that we learn from these speeches that can be applied in those domains and maybe not?

672
01:16:57,540 --> 01:16:59,020
So that's the question I want you to wrestle with.

673
01:16:59,410 --> 01:17:04,930
How generalizable are the ideas that we've talked about in these speeches to other kinds of contexts?

674
01:17:04,930 --> 01:17:06,370
Where do they feel like they're appropriate?

675
01:17:06,850 --> 01:17:12,100
Where do they feel like they're not okay to take the last few minutes talking to groups about that kind of a question?

676
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:26,190
It's a pretty broad question, like any kind of like how much do we want to use, you know, obesity, for example, to keep from coming to my mind,

677
01:17:26,350 --> 01:17:30,870
I certainly heard militaristic, you know, we're going to have a bad war against obesity kind of language used.

678
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:36,370
Is that appropriate for. Like the market.

679
01:17:36,390 --> 01:17:59,190
And I think if you want to cover that, it's I think it's really important for certain things to get as we educate them.

680
01:17:59,190 --> 01:18:11,300
It sounds like right now, I think you can get a lot of our decks of riddles at some point.

681
01:18:11,970 --> 01:18:20,000
I think like the freezing cold is really stigmatizing people.

682
01:18:20,020 --> 01:18:22,379
Like, I mean, yeah, like here.

683
01:18:22,380 --> 01:18:43,320
But, you know, it's, it's like you feel like it's more of like you're fighting these guys where it's like so many cases where it's like,

684
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:52,810
you know, that's a really cool way to interact with your health that are really very interesting though.

685
01:18:52,860 --> 01:18:57,240
I would say. Yes.

686
01:18:59,610 --> 01:19:08,790
I mean, like I said, I'm just going to back to your sense is that there is a randomness like we get to and there is like some randomness.

687
01:19:09,240 --> 01:19:14,850
And so I think that's really good things like here is what we are doing.

688
01:19:15,150 --> 01:19:20,520
Probably they're calling it systems like and you can do things that you haven't

689
01:19:20,970 --> 01:19:30,480
done that starts with an accident is that we're not producing any more jobs,

690
01:19:31,140 --> 01:19:38,010
diminishing those like crazy thing and you have to get to that in the first place.

691
01:19:38,010 --> 01:19:56,819
It's just like outside of the core issue of his opponents like some outcomes tell them like in Ukraine or everybody because

692
01:19:56,820 --> 01:20:07,550
I take both ends of the spectrum so so so they kind of like deniable I know and it's like anything is doesn't do anything.

693
01:20:08,190 --> 01:20:19,169
Yes I could school I feel like this is that like that I feel like I feel like it feels like waiting

694
01:20:19,170 --> 01:20:29,790
for something like this can be like the first thing that comes to mind is the support of dark matter.

695
01:20:29,790 --> 01:20:32,040
Like, that's like that.

696
01:20:32,550 --> 01:20:42,370
That's really funny because like I was going to get up there after was the worst thing like that was just be honest like this is what

697
01:20:42,390 --> 01:21:03,880
I to be that I get for example I have a mixtape that I think that I was I was that that moment and what I remember what it was like,

698
01:21:04,890 --> 01:21:11,630
you know, they actually care how much you play earlier.

699
01:21:13,590 --> 01:21:25,559
There's a whole bunch of federal funding the situation by just leaving it up and running the distinction between so all right,

700
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:36,520
I should let you guys go if you have further questions on this afternoon Thursday and everything from a through

701
01:21:36,570 --> 01:22:02,520
A about this perceptions of behavior so that people are going to go through their shelves this morning.

702
01:22:02,650 --> 01:22:12,690
And I was like, no way I could find another day out of it.

703
01:22:14,530 --> 01:22:17,370
I, I think that's really.
