1
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:10,070
I think in the darkness their friends that I.

2
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:23,280
Yeah. Okay.

3
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:28,170
Are you just. Yeah, we're just waiting. We're like, okay, okay.

4
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:35,160
Let's give her one moment. Warning, guys.

5
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:46,330
What are we doing today? They were talking about cancer registration. We're going to have our news article presentation in a minute.

6
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:50,080
And the other thing is, I put you all in groups for the final project,

7
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:56,739
and we are going to introduce the fact that we're going to do the first real lecture is fairly short.

8
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:05,200
So we're going to do that and then we're going to talk about the presentation and what it's like,

9
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,660
what the final project is going to be in a little bit more detail.

10
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:11,860
And then I'm going to you guys are going to get into your groups and you're going to talk and kind of fill out.

11
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:14,559
There's like a what's it called?

12
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:23,230
Like a survey or something about like what cancer is you guys would like to to do so you can meet with your groups and fill that out together.

13
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:26,620
Okay. So that's the plan. I'm out of the way.

14
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:33,230
I give you guys the floor. All right.

15
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:36,470
Hey, everyone. Hope you're all having a nice Thursday.

16
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,500
We're really excited to talk about this article.

17
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,350
We found it the other day and it was trending on the Harvard Gazette. So pretty exciting.

18
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,770
And essentially, just to kind of give you some background.

19
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:56,780
This article is pulled from a systematic review from the Brigham in Brigham and Women's Hospital,

20
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:03,560
and they did a systematic review and found that since 1990,

21
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:10,969
the rate or the incidence of early onset cancers, um, cancers including breast, colon,

22
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:16,580
esophagus and a few others have increased dramatically in people under the age of 50.

23
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:21,350
And we'll kind of get into some of those risk factors that they outlined in a bit.

24
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:25,820
But they were attributing this to something called the birth cohort effect,

25
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:30,910
which essentially means that each successive generation has a higher risk than the previous one.

26
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:35,930
So we have a greater risk than the people that were born ten years before us.

27
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:40,760
So that's just a little bit of background and we'll go into it further.

28
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:53,450
Yeah, so this was really interesting and a couple of the risk factors that they talked about were early exposures to environmental factors.

29
00:02:55,220 --> 00:03:03,470
A lot of the things like highly processed foods, sugary beverages, obesity, type two diabetes,

30
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:13,210
just a general rise in sedentary lifestyle as well as alcohol consumption and finally sleep deprivation.

31
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:22,520
So those were all factors that they looked at that they found significantly increased since the 1950s.

32
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:29,480
So in each successive cohort of children, they're being exposed to these factors.

33
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:40,890
And that increasing their cancer risk. One particular factor that the article touched on was sleep deprivation.

34
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:49,540
So they noticed that while sleep deprivation hasn't generally changed over the past few decades,

35
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:58,510
children are having a much higher prevalence of sleep deprivation in the modern age.

36
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:05,420
And that would be something that's. Increased cancer risk.

37
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:16,880
One thing that they didn't mention very briefly was if the increase in incidence was due to high bid screening and early screenings,

38
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,630
they mentioned that it was insignificant, but they didn't really go into further detail.

39
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:26,950
Another limitation was that they didn't collect enough information from low and middle income countries.

40
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:36,290
So in the future, hopefully working with like global health professionals and updating their cancer repositories to drive cancer prevention.

41
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:46,380
Cancer care. One other thing they didn't really explore was differences in racial and ethnic differences across these lines.

42
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:51,110
So as we know, health disparities affect cancer rates.

43
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:59,220
So in the future, going to that would be really important. Future applications could be collecting data from those low and middle income countries,

44
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:04,860
also saying a first cohort longitudinal study where they would collect specimens,

45
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:09,420
health records, leveraging AI and other technologies to keep a better record.

46
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:20,760
And in the future, they want to look into more novel cancer risk genetic factors and improve lifestyle among adolescents.

47
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,810
Yeah, so we have a few questions to ask you all.

48
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:28,740
So our first question, what are your general impressions on this?

49
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:33,270
Just like being a part of the at risk population, how do you feel about this?

50
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:41,190
Anybody have any thoughts? Yeah.

51
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:46,580
I think the sleep deprivation is like you're saying, like I especially like having a younger sister,

52
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:53,969
like watching your brother who's going to be like like she will just like be on the iPod or something like up to like one, 2 a.m. in the morning.

53
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:58,890
And like, even like for me, like I'd be up until like midnight and ah, she's 72 and it seems like some of those things are.

54
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:02,600
As kids aren't getting the technology at an earlier age.

55
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:06,680
It's just one of those things where they're very likely to be super late at night.

56
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:11,480
And we know that like those negative effects on sleep. So that was something that was.

57
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:15,889
Yeah, exactly. That's what we were talking about.

58
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:20,780
And that's one of the reasons that we found this article super interesting and wanted to bring it to you all.

59
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:27,950
So I'm going to push back on that just a little, because just playing devil's advocate for fun, I'm not, like telling you you're wrong.

60
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:35,660
I'm just so as a person, I'm 45. So I grew up in the eighties when we didn't have phones in our hands.

61
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:40,580
And I mean, we had a computer, but it was like a house computer and you had to use the phone to get on the Internet.

62
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:43,280
So you weren't on the Internet just for fun late at night.

63
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:50,780
So but I was still up until like one or two in at night reading a book or listening to music or doing whatever.

64
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:58,010
So I'm not I'm wondering how they determined that like younger sleep deprivation, like what ages are they talking about?

65
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:06,290
And like, I would want to know more about how they measured sleep deprivation and how they determined that it's getting worse in younger people.

66
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:15,560
Because, I mean, I, you know, sports practice, my sister would get up at 5 a.m. to go to swimming, swimming practice because swimmers are crazy.

67
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:22,910
900am. We're getting wet. No, thank you. So she goes to practice the 5 a.m. and then she go to school day.

68
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:28,459
And then if you have, like, for each class, like an hour of homework, 6 hours of homework, you're up till midnight, 1:00 in the morning.

69
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:37,930
And so it was I mean, it was pretty rough even then. So there's like a biological sensation where you're like when you sleep shifts later.

70
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:44,580
So I wonder to. Like school start times.

71
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:49,729
So I mean, I know I guess that was opportunity in the sense. Four.

72
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:54,070
But I do wonder if there's, like, four.

73
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:03,770
Later in high school I start training. So I know it's been a very long time, but actually I really think when you know that this life,

74
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:08,040
no one's going to do it because everybody needs to go to work.

75
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:15,900
Yeah, it's way. But yeah, especially in high school, that's when you go through all the bad stuff.

76
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:27,120
But now as a parent, I'm just saying, like, I worry less about my, like the sweet spot is right now and my kid is like 11 or 12.

77
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:32,429
Like all he's going to do by himself and play video games and maybe microwave some things, you know what I mean?

78
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:38,219
Like, when you're when you're older in your home alone, that's when you potentially get into trouble and younger you're going to just,

79
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:46,630
like, burn the house down because you don't know anything but. I guess I'm a little surprised to, because I feel like.

80
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:54,280
When I talk to my parents, they're like, Oh, we just really care about, like, nutritional things when we were growing up, like, we have to go.

81
00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:00,480
Time really for fun. We're like, they wouldn't wear sunscreen and things like that.

82
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:07,300
So I'm like. I feel like. Should be higher risk factors.

83
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:12,550
But I feel like there's a push in our age to really like practice.

84
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:21,320
To some extent. So, yeah, this is kind of surprising to me because you got to have innovation patient.

85
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:32,270
Technology for. How much of that wellness, though, is like evidence based?

86
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:36,270
How much of the stuff that people like, wellness stuff that people do is based on?

87
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:41,799
Yeah. Yeah. Some of it.

88
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:47,230
I mean. Yes, not eating a lot of fast food. Everyone agrees that's a good thing, right?

89
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:50,350
Eating more protein, more plants? Yes. Totally.

90
00:09:52,390 --> 00:10:02,500
Yeah, that was something we talked about was kind of the rise in wellness and the idea of healthy lifestyles.

91
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:14,620
Um, we also talked about how that is catered very much to a certain socio economic group and a lot of people who can't afford,

92
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:24,620
like going to the gym or eating healthy food like we were talking about chia seeds and $15 avocado toast.

93
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:28,959
Like it's not necessarily accessible to everybody.

94
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:35,080
And with the rise in sedentary lifestyles as as a whole, like throughout the country,

95
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:44,379
we were thinking that that could be a big factor, that for the majority of people, their lifestyles are getting more sedentary.

96
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:48,430
And that still continues to be a big source of.

97
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:57,980
So. My understanding of this, having not read the original paper, is that they did.

98
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:02,580
They're kind of saying, yes, there's a rise in cancers for people under 50,

99
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:09,090
seems to be a birth cohort related thing based on like the numbers of cancers and how they're rising.

100
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:16,530
Then they are hypothesizing based on things that have changed over that period, what could be related.

101
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:22,530
So they haven't actually looked at sleep deprivation when you're young and risk of cancer when you're older.

102
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:27,900
So I want you guys to think about this is something that's really, really hard in cancer.

103
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:32,190
So we're going to get to our study design lecture and we'll talk about this in a lot more detail when we get there.

104
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:36,420
I'm going to turn around so I'm not like I'm going to come up here. So I'm not just looking at one part of the room.

105
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:40,290
But think about how you would study that.

106
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:43,670
So how would you study that when like what you can.

107
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,250
Let's just go with you guys have heard of a case control study and a cohort study, right?

108
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:52,020
So pick one. What you're going to which one you want to do?

109
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:57,159
Just for fun. Pick one. Cohort.

110
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,420
Great, you're going to do a cohort.

111
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:07,090
So you want to get so for a cohort, you want to get people who don't have cancer and follow them over time until they get cancer.

112
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:12,340
And you want to get childhood or early life exposures on these people.

113
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:18,480
When are you like, how old are they going to be when you recruit them? How old do you want to recruit these people?

114
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:25,120
If you're going to do it, the most right way to collect childhood exposure is you're going to want year at birth, recruit them at birth.

115
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:33,550
How long are you going to have to follow these people till they get cancer? I mean, to get the young cancer is 50, but it's still pretty rare.

116
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:37,620
Like you're going to, you know, cancer under 50 is rising, but it's still quite rare.

117
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:43,379
So you're going to have to the average age of onset is still like 68 or something like that.

118
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:48,300
The median age right now, on average, the median. So you're going to have to follow these people for 70 years.

119
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,930
Who's doing this study like I am.

120
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:59,970
I am still I just I was involved in my cares, but I am a co-investigator on my cares because I'm an associate level professor.

121
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:07,410
They're not going to give people millions of dollars to start a cohort who aren't like full professors.

122
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:10,740
Been doing research for 20 years kind of people. Right.

123
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:16,110
So I'm a coauthor on it and I hope to move into a stronger leadership role as people retire.

124
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:20,640
That's sort of the plan, but they're not going to. I couldn't have written that grant as a PI and gotten it.

125
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,260
Okay, so you got people who are probably in their fifties and sixties writing the grant.

126
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:29,489
They're putting together this study that's going to be not even younger.

127
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:33,450
It's like generations of researchers later are actually going to be able to analyze the data.

128
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:35,099
How many people are you? How many?

129
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:42,389
I mean, that's that's it's millions of dollars we got the grant is like $10 million with a big cost share from the cancer center.

130
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:45,780
And we're still kind of doing it on a shoestring. To be fair.

131
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:52,230
Right. And we're recruiting 100,000 people and that is expecting cancers in older people.

132
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:57,690
That's powered for cancers overall. If you want to power a cohort study for young cancer,

133
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:05,730
you need multiple hundreds of thousands of people to get enough cases to study them in young onset cases.

134
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:15,900
So we're talking and then, you know, the the money that we've got for my care is for the first six years to recruit 100,000 people.

135
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:21,479
And it includes like a little kick in from the cancer center, hope to link with the cancer registry even if we don't get further funding.

136
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:26,730
But to do anything else besides just link with what data we have, we're going to need more funding.

137
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:37,950
It costs millions of dollars, like a couple million a year, probably for like a full infrastructure of bio specimen tracking, following people.

138
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:42,600
It's a big, big amount of money. So if you want to do this, you want to recruit kids.

139
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:47,040
Hundreds of thousands of kids, measure exposures and follow them over time.

140
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:58,259
That's why no one's done it. It's like almost impossible to really do that kind of work to to get tried to prospectively

141
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:05,040
collect childhood exposures on kids and then follow them for cancer is like almost impossible,

142
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:12,810
honestly. So that's the that's the problem in my care.

143
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:16,070
So guess what we're doing. So cool. I'm super excited.

144
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:22,910
So we're doing people who live in Michigan, right? And since 19 and we're recruiting young are we're recruiting on the young cyber recruiting.

145
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:26,269
25 to 44 year olds. So that's pretty young for a cancer cohort.

146
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:31,849
Most cancer cohorts recruit in middle age so that they don't have to wait more than about ten years to get cases right.

147
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:36,049
But we went younger because we wanted to capture those kind of like young adult

148
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:39,740
mid-life exposures prospectively because that's a little bit more doable,

149
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,870
right? So we're doing that.

150
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:48,739
And then since 1987, you guys know when babies are born, they like do a heel stick and then they put a blood spot on a card.

151
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,149
And it's for like metabolic screening.

152
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:55,430
There are certain metabolic disorders they screen for immediately a birth because if you don't treat them immediately, the baby will die.

153
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:58,670
So they do this metabolic screening and since 1987,

154
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:03,680
they've banked those cards at the Michigan Department of Health and you can use them for research purposes.

155
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:07,879
So if we have lifelong Michiganders in our study that we are recruiting and

156
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:14,990
the emigration out of Michigan is fairly small compared to a lot of places.

157
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:20,810
So I would guess we're going to have a a good chunk of the people here who were born in our study, who are enrolled, who are born here.

158
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,440
If they were born in 1987 or later,

159
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:30,979
we can link back and get their neonatal blood spot cards and measure like environmental exposures at birth in that.

160
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:34,130
Cool. I'm so excited. I'm like super geeking out about it.

161
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,840
We're we're very excited about that piece of it.

162
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:43,520
But like, that's the kind of like clever stuff you have to do really to get like birth exposures, early life exposures.

163
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:51,160
Must also be difficult just because of the amount of unknown environmental exposures that there still are.

164
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:57,520
Yeah, I mean, and that's the other piece of what we're doing is nobody that's why the NIH and I,

165
00:16:58,030 --> 00:17:08,380
NCI and I just put out this great call is because environmental cohort studies focused on environmental exposures in cancer are limited.

166
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:16,840
So that's what we're doing. And they're doing a 70 year long study from like Earth through the cancer things you're trying to look for.

167
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:20,680
The exposures might be irrelevant in 70 years. Exactly right. That's exactly right.

168
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,079
And that's the that's the problem we run into with that.

169
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:29,469
I was talking about somebody over here on the first day asked about like HRT and oral contraceptives.

170
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:29,770
Right.

171
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:35,870
Like the people who are getting cancer now, the versions of those that they took are completely different from what you guys are are taking now.

172
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:44,620
Right. And so it's almost as if you're almost studying like a historic exposure that doesn't exist anymore when you're looking at those things.

173
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:50,080
Not that it doesn't have value. It does, but it's not really the exact same thing.

174
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:55,230
Yes. We're talking like environmental exposures such as.

175
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:02,730
Probably typically influenza would be that the genome could be to what extent?

176
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:07,270
You can study like what partners are like, what needs to.

177
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:13,550
Patterns are like types of cancer in my.

178
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:17,230
Looking out over shorter periods of time, like when there was a rise.

179
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:25,020
That's what we're doing. We're measuring the epigenome, the like hairs and some of that, like inflammation and stress markers.

180
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:29,049
And then as in intermediate markers, these things have been associated with risk of cancer.

181
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:33,160
So before we get cancer cases, we're going to be looking at things.

182
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:40,680
And that was. Yeah.

183
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:45,990
That's very smart. Yeah. And that's what you do, right? You come up with some intermediate marker and then just out of interest.

184
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:49,740
Are you guys looking into any gut microbiome, stuff like that as well?

185
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:57,030
It is not right now, but that is like this is such a big enterprise that that's definitely something you could add.

186
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:04,530
Like there's a million grants that you can write off of this. Like the initial grant was to collect some bio specimens,

187
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:11,460
measure some specific environmental things like blood and stuff like that in the blood and saliva,

188
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:13,499
and look at it and analyze the intermediate markers.

189
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:21,840
And that's how it is for cancer, so that the initial scope of the grant is limited, but you build it so that people can build off of that, right?

190
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:26,609
So for sure you could go like do a gut microbiome, some study, right?

191
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:31,260
I might get a thousand, 2000 people who are in your study and go through our them, for example or whatever.

192
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:36,910
Um, we all people are already talking about doing pregnancies and so forth.

193
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:40,979
Like so as women become pregnant, enrolling them in the study to,

194
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:46,740
to study down to the infants, um, I want to do a young onset cancer case control study.

195
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:50,630
So we're recruiting cancer free people in the 25 to 44 year old age range.

196
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:55,890
I want to then go to the cancer registry and get all of the cancers between 25 and 44 that happen while we're recruiting,

197
00:19:56,250 --> 00:20:02,040
match them with the My peers participants as controls and look at risk factors for young cancer.

198
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:09,180
That's what I'm but we have to enroll enough people that we can convince I age that we're going to have a cohort to do that with at the end.

199
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:12,959
Right. We have yet to have something to be like, oh, and look at what we've done.

200
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,500
It's so great and now we want to build on it. You can't be like, We're totally going to do that thing.

201
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:20,399
We said we were going to do that we haven't actually done yet, but we will, I swear.

202
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,460
And also we'd like more money. Like that's not very yet. Right, that graph.

203
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:28,650
So we got to get a little more recruitment under our belts first. But that's the plan.

204
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:34,350
Yeah, this is a big problem. And they just changed the colon cancer screening requirements because of this.

205
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:38,550
They moved it down to 45. Oh, it was 50 like huh.

206
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:46,020
I think there is something in the article yet probably because it was until like last year on the toughest class it was 50.

207
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:49,230
And now I'm like, oh god, change that slide because they changed it to 45.

208
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:53,310
So my husband's 49. I'm like, Oh, guess what?

209
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:57,330
You're early, it's early. You get to go now. And he's like, No.

210
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:04,650
I'm like, Yep, call your doctor. So what you get for being married to a cancer epidemiologist and I make you do all the things.

211
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:15,870
All right, good job, guys. All rights.

212
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:23,370
All right. So we use these data in the last couple of classes, right?

213
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:30,910
So we've actually done sorry, since we've actually done the thing that we use the data,

214
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:34,059
we've gone and looked up the data that we're going to talk about how they collect it now.

215
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:34,390
Right.

216
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:41,739
So we're going to talk about in the U.S. because, you know, it's so varied around the world, you know, you can't really do a whole lecture on that.

217
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:46,810
But we're going to talk about how we do cancer registration in the U.S. So I think we should back up a step.

218
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,500
This is a screenshot from everybody's favorite bedtime reading.

219
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,920
The Dictionary of Epidemiology put you right to sleep.

220
00:21:55,540 --> 00:22:02,020
So a registry importantly is, you know, the red dirt register is applied to the file of data,

221
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:08,860
but a registry is the system of ongoing registration and dissemination.

222
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:15,579
Right. Really important is that you're trying to get all cases of a particular disease or other health

223
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:21,100
relevant condition in a defined population such that the cases can be related to a population base.

224
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:35,350
That is how you get a population based registry. Okay, so many types are not population based, so disease specific or hospital or clinic based.

225
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:41,010
And a lot of the cancer registries in developing countries are like hospital based, right?

226
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:43,840
There'll be one hospital and they'll count the cases that come to that hospital.

227
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,240
So population based registries are usually considered to be the most useful type.

228
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:57,520
So just a quick history. The first registries were cancer registries were started in Europe around 1900.

229
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:01,090
The first population based cancer registry was in Germany in 1926.

230
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,660
And age and site specific registries exist, right?

231
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:10,570
So for example, they're looking at childhood cancers in Oxford, UK, g.I, cancers in France,

232
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:20,500
in u.s. connecticut has the oldest ongoing registry in the U.S. why do you think Connecticut has such a nice, long history of cancer registration?

233
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:25,630
Highly educated as well as wealthy. That's true.

234
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:35,499
It's small. Yeah. If you want to do a population based registry and you have a really small population pretty easy,

235
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:42,280
there's probably one to maybe hospitals that really treat cancer, especially in 1935.

236
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:46,450
So going to get the data is actually easy, right?

237
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:50,080
It's pretty easy. It's a very circumscribed small population. Pretty easy to do.

238
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:57,060
So let's talk a little bit about your hospital based population.

239
00:23:57,150 --> 00:24:02,640
I almost a population, you guys. Oh, my goodness. Hospital based versus population based registries.

240
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:07,530
So if you have a hospital has its own registry and the state of Michigan has its own registry.

241
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:15,600
So how would you expect these to differ? Like, what would you miss if you only use the US hospital registry versus the state of Michigan?

242
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:18,870
Like, how do you think the cases that you catch would be different?

243
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:32,820
How are the cases that come to you about different than the whole state of Michigan?

244
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:38,590
In three geographic locations.

245
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:42,870
Yeah. So they're all. Yeah, they're.

246
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:47,210
We're trying to be like we're trying to make the whole thing our current area, but we still kind of miss a lot of.

247
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:54,010
Right. So that a lot of the lower, lower third I would say is where a lot of our hospitals are located.

248
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:59,700
I could be wrong, but this can be.

249
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,540
So you're thinking higher as these people.

250
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:10,390
Also, if you're going to travel from the U.P. to come down here for treatment, you have the ability to travel.

251
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:14,890
Right. I saw some of you over here first, I think. Yeah. It's similar to.

252
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:21,460
A lot. In every area of life.

253
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:27,020
Area. You're coming to an hour in the first half of the three minute.

254
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:34,270
To do that in. I do that.

255
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:38,770
So but also like what kind of cancers is that what you guys are going to say?

256
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:46,430
Yeah, like more. Like you said. Yeah.

257
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:53,830
You're going to get people who are who have, you know, maybe they've been treated already by their their local hospital and they came back.

258
00:25:53,840 --> 00:26:01,210
And so now they're trying to get into like. Clinical trials feel like an experimental treatment or something like that.

259
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:10,929
Or they've got like we get like 30%, 20% of all head and neck cancer cases from Michigan come to you around because that is a specialty.

260
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:14,520
You know, you need a head neck surgeon to do that. They're not at every hospital.

261
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:18,819
Right. So, yeah. So you might get worst cases.

262
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:24,850
You might. So the other thing, too, is like, if you look at, you know, we're going and we'll talk about that.

263
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:29,800
I'll get to that in a minute. But yeah, so you're going to get we also get more white people at University of Michigan.

264
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:32,680
So the racial demographics are not representative of the state.

265
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:41,710
A lot of the black population lives in metro Detroit and they generally go to Karmanos because it's a really good hospital and it's right there.

266
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:45,670
Right? So we have a wider population than the state average.

267
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:50,020
So yeah, so you're going to miss things. And also, what's the denominator like?

268
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:55,060
If you wanted to look at rates in Michigan and you only have the cases from the University of Michigan Hospital,

269
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:58,780
who is the base population that goes to the University of Michigan Hospital?

270
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:08,830
Yes. The faces are all cracked. Uh, I mean, I don't know.

271
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:12,730
It's people who can make it here. I don't know. That's hard to do, right?

272
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:19,040
Figuring out who, who did not who, who the denominator population is that serves this hospital is really tricky, right?

273
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:26,580
Okay. So that's why population based registries are better because you know what the denominator is.

274
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:32,700
If you take all of the cases that occur in the state of Michigan, no matter where they're treated, the denominator is the population of Michigan.

275
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:36,500
Well. Yeah. So there's the.

276
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:40,760
She then just. It doesn't.

277
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:45,300
That's correct. Okay.

278
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:49,870
So let's talk about the cancer registry system in the U.S. So incidence data is collected by registries.

279
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:56,890
There's two systems of registries in the U.S. The oldest one is SEER, which stands for surveillance, epidemiology and end results.

280
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:04,180
It is population based, but it covers about 28% of the U.S. population that is funded by the National Cancer Institute.

281
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,010
So the NIH, NCI.

282
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:17,110
And PCR, which is the national program of cancer registries along with SEER, covers 96% of the population and that's funded by the CDC.

283
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:22,190
So this PCR does not duplicate what's here is what SEER is doing.

284
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:31,969
It's like you were saying with U of M hasn't really like if SEER is collecting data on these particular counties, then and PCR does the rest of it.

285
00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:36,080
And then when the state is reported, it's all of it put together that makes sense.

286
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:45,930
Excuse me. And then the mortality data is collected by the National Vital Statistics System, which is part of CDC.

287
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:53,170
So let's talk about Seer. So Seer was established because the National Cancer Act of 1971 was signed by Richard Nixon,

288
00:28:53,180 --> 00:29:00,200
and this was designed to strengthen the National Cancer Institute, and it provided funding for this like national population based registry system.

289
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:03,680
And so SEER started January 1st, 1973.

290
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:10,399
It originally included Connecticut, Iowa, New Mexico, Utah, Hawaii, Detroit, San Francisco, Oakland and Puerto Rico.

291
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:15,080
So that was out of 1989. That's who was in the first wave.

292
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:23,600
These were chosen because they included significant population subgroups and they have the ability to implement,

293
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:28,790
operate and maintain a high quality registry. So there are quality requirements for being in SEER.

294
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:31,850
Registries have gotten kicked out if they don't meet those requirements.

295
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:39,250
Okay. So, for example, like New Mexico was included probably because it included a lot of Hispanics.

296
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,470
Hawaii and San Francisco, you get a fair bit of Asian folks.

297
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:49,630
Detroit includes a huge chunk of the African-American population that we have in here.

298
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:54,969
Puerto Rico, again, Hispanic people. Right. So you were trying to kind of they were trying to cobble together, like,

299
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:58,240
let's go to all these different places so we can get kind of different kinds of people. Right.

300
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:08,709
So this is over time they've added registries and as of now they were trying to add more kind of subgroups, right?

301
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:12,070
So for example, they added Cherokee Nation and Arizona Indians at some point.

302
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:15,129
So you have more Native American coverage, also less.

303
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:21,340
Also Alaska Natives, they added more, more spots in San Francisco, Seattle, Puget Sound.

304
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:25,240
They added they were trying to get some rural areas, too. Right.

305
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:35,620
So they added like a rural Georgia and Atlanta. So, you know, the idea behind this kind of registry system in a lot of places do it.

306
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:41,169
It's what they were doing in Thailand, like I mentioned, is that you try to find these places that can do a good job,

307
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:48,100
but that kind of represent different pieces of your population so that you have kind of a good snapshot.

308
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:54,339
Okay. So since 2001, it covers about 28% of the US population.

309
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:58,570
We're getting 26% of the African-Americans, 38% of Hispanics,

310
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:04,060
44% of American Indians and Alaska Natives, 50% of Asians and 67% of Hawaiian Pacific Islanders.

311
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:08,469
So we are clearly oversampling these groups, right? Which is what you want to do.

312
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:11,800
And then you can figure out how they relate to the population base.

313
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:21,340
So this is population based and it currently contains records, more than 8 million cancers with about 440,000 new cases recorded per year.

314
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:27,269
So your data are available to everyone with some conditions.

315
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:32,490
So you guys access them online, but you can also just download them and analyze them yourself,

316
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:36,840
which is a bit of a programing and data management challenge.

317
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:44,540
Right. But you can get data from here and just get ones that. The conditions of this are that no attempt will be made to identify an individual.

318
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:49,370
I have no idea how you would do that anyway, because it's already identified, but you should not try.

319
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:54,440
Data is going to be used for research and statistical reporting only,

320
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:58,610
and no specific outcomes will be presented by hospital or compared across hospitals.

321
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:18,229
That was weird, right? What's that about? So the way that we get these data is that like seer registries will employ medical record abstraction

322
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:23,690
lists and they will actually have a relationship with the hospital whereby if the hospital has its own,

323
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:27,349
like for U of M hospital, if you will, that the hospital was included in SEER. It's not.

324
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:32,719
But if it were, they have a good system of record keeping and they have their own registry at the hospital.

325
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,800
And so the person from Seer would come in and like work with the registry to get the data.

326
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:40,400
But if it's a smaller hospital that does not have its own registry,

327
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:48,530
they might send a registrar in to work with the hospital records and SEER would essentially be maintaining the registry for the hospital.

328
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:50,000
Does that make sense?

329
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:57,710
So if you are putting out data that says a hospital is doing a crappy job of treating cancers because their death rate is higher than a hospital, B,

330
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:04,100
they're not going to be happy with you and they are not going to allow you to come in and have their data if you're using it to make them look bad.

331
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:08,360
That's part of it. The other part is that it may not make sense.

332
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:13,310
So let's think, for example, about like a neighborhood hospital where people are going to be three different kind of normal every day,

333
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:18,730
not that many cancers every day, but, you know, sort of your average cancer.

334
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:24,770
But then think about M.D. Anderson, one of the best cancer hospitals in the entire country.

335
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:29,959
Who is going to be Anderson? It's even more extreme than University of Michigan.

336
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:34,640
They almost exclusively treat like high risk, weird cancers,

337
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,500
people who failed regular treatment like three or four times and are dying to get on some sort of clinical trial.

338
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:43,910
Right. They're treating odd cancers or worse cancers than average.

339
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:52,099
So their death rate may actually be higher, even though they're one of the best cancer hospitals in the whole country than the neighborhood hospital.

340
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:55,069
Right. And it has nothing to do with the quality of care that's being provided.

341
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:59,210
It has a lot to do with the kinds of cancers that are showing up on their door. Right.

342
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:05,540
So it may not even be a reasonable comparison to make, if that makes sense.

343
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:11,149
Right. So you don't do that. Data will not be linked to other data sets by the user.

344
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:15,890
Again, no idea how you would do that without any identifiers, but don't give it a shot.

345
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:21,410
Okay. So let's talk about the Metropolitan Detroit Cancer Surveillance System or the MDC.

346
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:29,959
So this was a part of Ciara until very recently and it covered Oakland, Macomb and Wayne Counties, which are quite close to here.

347
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:38,630
Right. Okay. So they identify and register all cancers inside to an invasive in residents of this tri county area.

348
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:47,479
The exceptions are basal and squamous basal and squamous cell skin cancers, benign brain tumors and in situ cervical cancers.

349
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:51,860
The caveat being that we did record in 90 cervical cancers for a while, but that's stopped.

350
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:57,560
So let's focus mostly on the the basal and squamous cell skin cancers here, for example.

351
00:34:58,190 --> 00:35:01,429
Why would they not include those in the cancer registry?

352
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:05,590
Because you will see a lot of the cancer registry data and I'll say without reason.

353
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:09,170
Right. So they just generally don't have to be sorry.

354
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:13,970
Is this very topical? Yeah. Where do they get?

355
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:17,870
Yeah, I just a dermatologist office. Right.

356
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:24,979
So the way that you're going to talk about the way that they go do this is that you kind of identify the hospitals that treat cancers right.

357
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:31,250
Or pathology centers that that look at cancer samples and determine if a person has cancer or not.

358
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:34,310
Right. And there's kind of a fairly limited number of those.

359
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:37,820
It's not like every single hospital. It's not every single doctor's office.

360
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:44,030
So it's actually I mean, it's not easy. It's a it's a logistical challenge, but it's circumscribed.

361
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:48,620
Right. There's a certain number of places you need to go to get all of the cancers that occur in a state.

362
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:55,580
If you were to include skin cancers, you start to like every doctor's office, every dermatologist that is like goodness.

363
00:35:55,580 --> 00:36:05,810
And it would just be a huge there's so many plus there's so low morbidity and mortality like they very rarely cause any kind of real major problems.

364
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:10,520
They're not really the same as breast cancer, right?

365
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:14,090
They're not really the same thing. Certainly not the same as a melanoma.

366
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:18,120
Right. So we don't count them. Okay.

367
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:25,009
Did you active surveillance from the time of diagnosis into death, meaning that they actually go and make sure, are these people recurring?

368
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:27,709
Are they dying of their cancer? Like what happens to this person,

369
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:35,360
what they're in the registry with respect to their cancer diagnosis and seer requires active follow up within 14 months of 95% of cases.

370
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:43,310
And this is the piece that a lot of registries can't do to maintain the quality standard of a see registry.

371
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:49,010
Can't do that kind of rapid follow up. And I know 14 months doesn't sound rapid.

372
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:52,760
It actually is when you're dealing with the kind of the amount of data that we're talking about.

373
00:36:52,760 --> 00:37:02,410
Yeah. So is it the employees? And DC has us that go out and these fellows are just like us in the hospital.

374
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:07,210
Like you stated, it depends. So that's this like you were reading my mind.

375
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:11,410
So to identify cases, the objectors go to hospitals and clinics.

376
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:15,100
So in this tri county area, there are 39 hospitals and four clinics that they go to.

377
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:19,510
They were all pathology labs that provide oncology services, which is like 14 of them.

378
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:25,540
They go to some freestanding medical facilities and physicians offices and they link electronically with the state of Michigan death certificates.

379
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:30,020
They also do a lot of work to follow people, so they will go in.

380
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,019
So if a hospital maintains a registry,

381
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:38,320
they may use the registry data that's already collected and kind of get that from the hospital and have that transferred to them from the hospital.

382
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:41,980
But if the hospital doesn't cover it, they will actually go into obstruction.

383
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:49,790
Does that make sense? And the way they're going to follow these people is voter fraud, voter registration,

384
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:54,169
DMV records, Social Security Administration, the National DEP Index. They'll also use LexisNexis.

385
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:58,670
Do you guys know about this? You can actually search people's, like, credit card usage.

386
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:02,600
I think it is. I don't know a whole lot about it. Do you know more? Not really.

387
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:11,089
But it's yeah. You can search people who are different. I think it uses like credit card history and things like that as well to kind of find

388
00:38:11,090 --> 00:38:14,900
people so they can they can find people through that if they haven't found them.

389
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:20,180
They'll also do like death notices. Like so there's still somebody when they were doing this at the at the Detroit registry,

390
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:25,610
there was somebody who was literally sit down every morning with the paper to see if any of their people had died.

391
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:38,120
So it's a lot of work. So at a glance in 2013, this is a little bit old, but I don't think it's changed a whole lot in Egypt.

392
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:42,470
They got about 24,000 total new cases in these three counties per year.

393
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:48,780
And they employ 27 abstractions, ten editors, five people who do follow up,

394
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:53,460
five i.t people, five management and research support people and three bio statisticians.

395
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:59,970
And like I said, they serve as the registry for several hospitals. That's a lot of people.

396
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,740
That's a lot of money. To pay these people every year.

397
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:09,080
And it's a lot of work to do this. To do it well.

398
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:19,560
I mean, it's it's a highly African-American population. And so, as we know, black people have somewhat higher cancer rates.

399
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:26,280
So a little bit but not like to the point that you're being overwhelmed with so many cancers that it's I mean,

400
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:32,070
I think what would drive the number of cases you're dealing with is more just the base population.

401
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:33,750
So these three counties are pretty populous.

402
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:42,120
So there may be other like other cancer issues that are like serious disease like that are that are doing in a formal state, maybe have more or fewer.

403
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:46,170
But this is a you know, this is a fairly good sized registry, but I don't think it's a crazy good one.

404
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:54,220
Like the L.A. registries are probably bigger. Okay.

405
00:39:56,990 --> 00:40:03,500
So like we said, model one is the hospital or clinical clinic employs a registrar and they report cases to the central registry.

406
00:40:03,830 --> 00:40:07,130
And then that central registry reports to data to and PCR or SEER.

407
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:11,240
The model two is that the central registry employs registrars who go into the

408
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:15,260
hospitals and collect information and then the central registry reports the

409
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:20,870
cases to a PCR or seer so that this is like the where the the seer registrars

410
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:25,010
are acting as the hospital registry or the hospital already has its own system.

411
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:32,600
There's kind of two ways you can do it and see the MDC employs both.

412
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:44,459
So the stuff that they get from the medical record is your basic demographics, right date of birth, address.

413
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:48,450
Telephone, race. Ethnicity. Sex. Marital status. Birthplace insurance coverage.

414
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:52,150
You're going to get clinical information about the tumor, right?

415
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:58,780
You're going to get the primary site tumor histology, stage grade, lymph node involvement, tumor size, marker status,

416
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:04,719
which is like that that your PR HER2 for the breast cancer, you know, so not all cancers have that, but some do.

417
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:09,940
So if it's something they collect for that particular cancer, they'll get that date of diagnosis.

418
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:16,450
They're going to get the first course of treatment. The follow up they're going to do.

419
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:21,519
Is there a recurrence? The second primary cancer. So that's like not a metastasis, right?

420
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:27,940
So of a tumor. If a person had liver cancer and then a tumor shows up in the breast, a pathologist would be able to determine,

421
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:33,129
is that a is that a liver cancer that metastasized there or is this an actual new breast cancer?

422
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:37,000
And the second primary would be a new breast cancer, right? Not a metastasis.

423
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:41,830
Vital status. Date of last activity. Date of death. Cause of death.

424
00:41:42,490 --> 00:41:46,450
And then medical identifiers like the hospital surgeon, archeologist and the follow up physician.

425
00:41:46,480 --> 00:42:11,280
So what's missing here that you might like to have? Yeah, maybe family history and family history.

426
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:15,960
Absolutely. If that's not there. Social determinants, right?

427
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:25,300
Like, what are you thinking? Diet environmental exposures.

428
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:31,090
Yeah. How much health care you do have? Insured status.

429
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:34,870
But that's not exactly what you're looking for. Yeah. Yeah.

430
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:41,420
Yeah. No smoking?

431
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:47,270
Yep. So this is really recording the person and the cancer, right?

432
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:55,400
They're not recording. A lot of information about that would allow you to do like etiologic research to try to understand risk factor associations.

433
00:42:56,300 --> 00:43:01,580
Yeah. You were saying that? Now.

434
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:08,809
That was to my study. Yeah. Yeah.

435
00:43:08,810 --> 00:43:17,150
So kind of like BMI, smoking, infection history, environmental risk factors, like any risk factors, stuff they are collecting.

436
00:43:17,150 --> 00:43:19,900
They're also not only collecting first course of treatment.

437
00:43:19,910 --> 00:43:26,090
So like when you get when you get treated for cancer, it's almost never like what is done right?

438
00:43:26,090 --> 00:43:30,170
Like your first course of treatment might be like chemo plus surgery,

439
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:37,790
and then you're okay for a while and then it comes back and they give you some radiation and you're okay for a while,

440
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:42,350
and then it comes back and they're going to give you some sort of oral medical thing.

441
00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:46,940
Like it's like this long, especially for things like breast and prostate.

442
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:53,000
There's going to be multiple rounds of like we did this thing, the tumor shrunk or seems to have gone away.

443
00:43:53,000 --> 00:44:00,020
Everything's fine. Then you're going to come in for scans and oh, now it's back and we need to do this next thing, right?

444
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:04,700
And so there will be a lot of that, especially for people who are surviving a fairly long time.

445
00:44:05,690 --> 00:44:10,970
I think it's pretty rare to like and lucky if you treat it once and then it never comes back.

446
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:15,799
Right. And those are the really like the really small brand new stage one cancer.

447
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,870
Sometimes that's totally a thing.

448
00:44:17,870 --> 00:44:25,189
But like anything past that, they're going to do something and then it's going to it's going to be a kind of a chronic disease,

449
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:31,040
essentially, is how cancer is being treated like successful cancer treatment is.

450
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:35,060
If you catch it really early, it's it's surgery and you're done.

451
00:44:35,330 --> 00:44:41,450
But a lot of times successful cancer treatment looks like we're going to keep kind of doing the next

452
00:44:41,450 --> 00:44:47,989
thing and maintaining your quality of life until you know you want to die of something else anyway,

453
00:44:47,990 --> 00:44:54,320
kind of a thing, right? So it's almost like a chronic disease that you're managing in some ways rather than curing.

454
00:44:55,820 --> 00:44:59,770
So you don't have that. You only have the first thing you do. All right.

455
00:45:00,410 --> 00:45:02,330
So there's a lot of stuff that the registry isn't collecting,

456
00:45:02,330 --> 00:45:08,480
but the purpose of the registry really is to kind of keep track of the cases and important things about that cancer.

457
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:15,200
So it's not really a research database, right? It is used for that, but it's really a tracking database.

458
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:21,940
So let's talk briefly now about PCR. This is the CDC one.

459
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:29,140
So we've talked a lot about Sierra. This is the CDC. So this was established in 1992 through the Cancer Registries Amendment Act,

460
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:34,740
provides registry funding for every state and territory and covers 96% of the population.

461
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:41,020
So essentially this kind of makes up the difference of what SERE is not covering so that the entire U.S. population,

462
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:44,430
more or less is covered by a cancer registry. Okay.

463
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:48,490
So SERE will pull through these registries of it.

464
00:45:48,490 --> 00:45:54,160
They tend not to be quite as high quality. Maybe they don't hit kind of some of those metrics that SERE does.

465
00:45:54,550 --> 00:46:01,230
I mean, they're high quality in the sense that they're accurately catching the cases, but like the rapid ascertainment piece is not necessarily right.

466
00:46:01,810 --> 00:46:07,630
So like the Michigan State Cancer Registry, they get the sirups, but they also get the whole rest of the state.

467
00:46:08,110 --> 00:46:11,349
So the Michigan State Registry from DHHS is not a registry.

468
00:46:11,350 --> 00:46:14,440
It is one of these and PCR registries.

469
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:20,050
But they take the piece that Sierra collects when they when they collect the data for the whole state.

470
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:23,840
Yeah. I like the background around the.

471
00:46:27,990 --> 00:46:33,960
I don't actually know, like the politics of why that came to be. That is an interesting question.

472
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:40,230
And I don't actually know how the 1971 act came to be either.

473
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:43,800
So I don't really know the history of those. But that is interesting.

474
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:52,919
Yeah. So remember that the incidence rate is the number of new cases of a disease that occurred

475
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:56,550
during a specific period of time in a population at risk of developing the disease.

476
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:00,690
And for cancer, we often express those per 100,000 people.

477
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:05,250
And the real trick with the population based registry is this number like we talked about this.

478
00:47:05,250 --> 00:47:08,460
Right. Who are the people at risk and where do we get that from?

479
00:47:10,450 --> 00:47:14,019
Like if you like satisfied the hospital versus population base.

480
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:18,459
Now say we're doing a population based registry in Michigan. Where do we get the number of people at risk in Michigan?

481
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:26,170
The number of people in Michigan? How do we know how many people are?

482
00:47:29,230 --> 00:47:33,340
Census. The census. That's exactly right. So we get that from the census.

483
00:47:33,890 --> 00:47:36,990
Okay. So that is and that has its own challenges, right?

484
00:47:37,150 --> 00:47:42,370
Census data is that we think of it as being sort of this from the census, how we know how many people there are.

485
00:47:42,370 --> 00:47:46,989
But it's actually not perfect, but it's good enough for getting accurate rates, certainly.

486
00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:56,229
But we know that undercount certain groups. And, you know, we can only do so much with it because it only asks about certain things.

487
00:47:56,230 --> 00:47:59,920
And it has changed a little bit over time and modernized a bit. This is the 2010 census.

488
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:02,920
The most recent one is 2020, but it's basically the same.

489
00:48:02,950 --> 00:48:11,809
I mean, one thing to look at here is, for example, race. And this is the problem that I mentioned with the Middle Eastern North African population,

490
00:48:11,810 --> 00:48:15,680
the MENA population, is that they would be checking the white box essentially here,

491
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:22,900
and they have done a fair bit of work to try to get a little more information on specific Asian like

492
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:30,470
not subregions but specific Asian races rather than just an Asian right or a specific like Hispanic.

493
00:48:32,190 --> 00:48:39,650
Oh, I guess they actually. Oh, yeah. Specific Hispanic ethnicity is great, but it's not ideal.

494
00:48:40,850 --> 00:48:43,270
All of these things could be further broken up. Right.

495
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:52,160
And it's kind of a balancing act between how many boxes you want to have in your survey and if you're really going to be able to do that much with it.

496
00:48:52,190 --> 00:48:57,530
Right. So if you get into like very small population subgroups, does it matter if you collected that?

497
00:48:57,530 --> 00:49:00,620
Because are you going to be able to look at anything with those people separately? Right.

498
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:05,690
From from. It matters to people to be able to say who they are on the census.

499
00:49:05,690 --> 00:49:09,230
Right. That is a separate issue and I totally recognize that.

500
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:20,150
But from a data collection point of view, if you collect data on the tiniest subgroup of people, you may not even be able to use that information.

501
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:25,500
Right. So that is where we get our denominator from.

502
00:49:25,530 --> 00:49:28,980
So just briefly, how much does this all cost? This is, you know, old at this point.

503
00:49:29,490 --> 00:49:37,200
But this year, fiscal year, 2016 budget was 3.2 million and PCR budget was 49 million for one year.

504
00:49:39,090 --> 00:49:41,100
Now, the U.S. is really, really big. Right.

505
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:47,340
So it's not a direct comparison to how much it might cost to do this in one of the developing countries we were talking about yesterday or Tuesday.

506
00:49:47,910 --> 00:49:51,690
But this is not peanuts to do this work.

507
00:49:51,870 --> 00:49:52,950
Well, right.

508
00:49:53,820 --> 00:50:02,910
So, I mean, in a smaller country, wouldn't cost $50 million a year to do it, but it's not going to cost, you know, a couple of thousand a year.

509
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:12,860
And this is why establishing high quality population based registries in low income countries is really hard because it's expensive.

510
00:50:19,790 --> 00:50:27,050
Okay. Any questions? All right.

511
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:34,710
In that case. Let's go ahead and switch gears and we're going to talk about the final project.

512
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:40,290
What am I doing? I'm going here.

513
00:50:42,730 --> 00:50:51,500
Okay. So this is a link to the final project. You can also find this under assignments and are going to download this and look at this here.

514
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:57,640
So this are the these are the guidelines on the rubrics. So I encourage you to use this document.

515
00:50:57,850 --> 00:51:02,469
The rubric is on canvas, but it's ugly. It's much prettier here and more readable.

516
00:51:02,470 --> 00:51:04,810
So I encourage you to download this. All right.

517
00:51:04,810 --> 00:51:09,129
So basically what you're going to do is you're going to report on the public health spectrum of your chosen cancer site.

518
00:51:09,130 --> 00:51:18,820
So what we're kind of going through this whole this whole semester, we're kind of traveling through this public health spectrum, right?

519
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:23,630
So we're going to be talking about the kind of the scope of the problem, the epidemiology of the cancer like.

520
00:51:23,650 --> 00:51:28,150
So how many cases are there? Is it is it a cancer that is commonly very survivable?

521
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:31,450
You know, is it diagnosed mostly at stage one or stage four?

522
00:51:31,450 --> 00:51:32,950
Is there a screening test for it?

523
00:51:33,310 --> 00:51:38,200
You know, all the kind of stuff that we have, not the screening test these, but the other things we kind of looked at in these data.

524
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:44,290
Right. What is the U.S. versus the global scope? Is this a more important problem in a developed versus a developing country?

525
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:46,959
Then we're going to start talking.

526
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:54,250
After we go through that, we're going to start talking a little bit about cancer biology and genetics, just to sort of understand how that works.

527
00:51:54,730 --> 00:52:01,160
And then we're going to talk about kind of the the primary, secondary and tertiary prevention pieces.

528
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:08,470
So primary prevention, what are the main risk factors? How would you reduce those risk factors to reduce this cancer ever happening?

529
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:11,770
Right. Secondary prevention, is there screening for this cancer?

530
00:52:13,750 --> 00:52:17,620
Tertiary prevention, how about survivorship in treatment of this cancer?

531
00:52:18,070 --> 00:52:24,550
Okay. And so what you're going to do is you're going to kind of go through and describe all of these pieces for this cancer that you're assigned.

532
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:32,709
So describe the current scope of the problem for your skin cancer in the U.S. and globally known risk factors and causes major disparities primary,

533
00:52:32,710 --> 00:52:37,540
secondary, tertiary prevention efforts, and basic concepts of the current state of treatment.

534
00:52:38,290 --> 00:52:40,690
I know a lot of you are interested in being doctors,

535
00:52:40,900 --> 00:52:46,510
and so the pitfall that a lot of people fall into is that they end up spending like three pages on treatment.

536
00:52:48,330 --> 00:52:52,379
Like a paragraph, like it's not the focus, right?

537
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:59,640
So and then the last piece is that you're going to discuss the public health relevance and important,

538
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:05,309
you're going to identify and describe an important ongoing area of scientific inquiry.

539
00:53:05,310 --> 00:53:11,130
Right. So you're going to kind of have to look a little bit at what's being done right now to kind of address some of the big public health problems.

540
00:53:11,610 --> 00:53:15,030
And you're going to discuss the public health relevance and importance of that and

541
00:53:15,030 --> 00:53:19,590
the potential impact of this ongoing research on the public health of those cancer.

542
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:25,530
So you're going to do this as a paper in an oral presentation?

543
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:30,660
So you're going to write it as if it were a scientific review paper in a public health journal.

544
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:34,960
So you're writing to a scientific audience, not a lay audience. Okay.

545
00:53:37,350 --> 00:53:40,550
And then after you listen to everybody's we'll talk about this a little bit more as we go.

546
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:46,469
But after you listen to everybody's presentations, you're going to ask you'll be asked to write like a one page reflection,

547
00:53:46,470 --> 00:53:49,470
comparing and contrasting your cancer with the other ones that are presented.

548
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:57,680
So this is 20% of your grade. It's a group assignment.

549
00:53:57,690 --> 00:54:02,240
All people are going to get the same grade. How many of you board group assignments and they're your favorite thing in the whole world.

550
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:11,590
Yeah, me too. But guess what? If you go look at my pub list, I have never published a paper with fewer than two other people.

551
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:15,850
Literally everything you do from now on is going to be your project.

552
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:21,759
Sometimes your groups are going to be great and they're going to be a lot of fun and you're going to really gel and have a great experience.

553
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:25,480
And sometimes it's going to suck and it's going to be a slog to get the thing done.

554
00:54:26,830 --> 00:54:30,760
And I get that. But I think it's important to this is an important skills development, right?

555
00:54:31,150 --> 00:54:34,000
So that's that is why we're doing it as a group.

556
00:54:36,070 --> 00:54:40,480
If you want to complain to me about I mean, truly, if you're having actual problems with your group, let me know.

557
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:45,730
I'm not trying to minimize that. Or if somebody is, you know, really not pulling their weight or something, you need help.

558
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:52,800
You let me know and I'll try to work with you guys on that. But if you just want to complain,

559
00:54:53,030 --> 00:54:55,930
complain about your group and I'm going to tell you about my group and the worst

560
00:54:56,050 --> 00:54:59,980
project I've ever been on last year for like seven years with weekly conference calls.

561
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:06,850
And it was absolutely just the worst thing in the whole world. So I think I will win if I think I'll win if we're going to have a complaint.

562
00:55:09,070 --> 00:55:21,720
Okay. Um. So you can divide the work up, but you need to present like a coherent and integrated product.

563
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:23,960
Often I'll get something where it's really clear that two people,

564
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:28,070
different people have written different parts and they didn't read each other's parts because they're saying like the same thing.

565
00:55:28,610 --> 00:55:34,010
So do integrate your pieces. What else?

566
00:55:35,650 --> 00:55:40,300
All group members should understand all the information. Right, and be able to ask to answer questions on it at the end.

567
00:55:42,730 --> 00:55:46,390
So one thing, you're going to have an interim product that's due on October 11.

568
00:55:47,290 --> 00:55:53,110
You're going to have an outline. This doesn't have to be in any particular format, right?

569
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:54,790
Bullet points are fine.

570
00:55:55,270 --> 00:56:01,750
I kind of want to see the list of major causes and risk factors disparities, prevention efforts and treatment survivorship issues.

571
00:56:02,110 --> 00:56:06,969
And I want to know kind of what areas of ongoing research you can. You could list a couple if you're kind of thinking about them.

572
00:56:06,970 --> 00:56:12,010
And I can give you feedback on what maybe which one is most appropriate. So this is for me to give you feedback.

573
00:56:12,310 --> 00:56:15,710
It doesn't like I said, it could be bullet points. It can be like a real outline.

574
00:56:15,730 --> 00:56:22,480
However, I don't want this to be busywork. So however it will help you to organize your project is how you should do it.

575
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:26,740
I just want to be able to look at it, be like, Oh, you're missing a huge hole here.

576
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:34,659
You really need to make sure you look into this for like, this is a really you're you're going off in the weeds.

577
00:56:34,660 --> 00:56:38,290
This is not a good direction. Right? Like, I want to make sure I help you guys with that before.

578
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:41,260
Before we get too far. Does that make sense?

579
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:48,210
So this is meant to be a stepping stone in to help you not to create extra busywork so it doesn't have to be, like,

580
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:54,010
beautiful or in a particular format, in some format that I can read and understand and therefore give you feedback.

581
00:56:54,130 --> 00:56:57,690
Yeah. Okay. Um.

582
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:06,270
The final thing is due November 15th, which is the first day of student presentations,

583
00:57:07,180 --> 00:57:10,380
or I will assign you guys to a particular date for your presentations.

584
00:57:10,890 --> 00:57:20,100
After I know what cancers you have that the final oral presentation is, 30 minutes followed by 10 minutes for questions and discussion.

585
00:57:20,730 --> 00:57:31,440
The paper is 1010 double spaced pages in addition with 10.3 pages of writing, and then also the title page of the title page for the ten pages.

586
00:57:31,890 --> 00:57:37,080
I'm not like here. A couple of lines over the ten pages are not the NIH.

587
00:57:37,090 --> 00:57:40,020
I'm not going to cut them off and not read them. That's not what this is about.

588
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:49,270
The ten pages is more to give you a sense of like how much detail I'm asking for, what level of detail in the product I'm interested in, right?

589
00:57:49,650 --> 00:57:53,010
If you have 15 pages, something's wrong, but not too much stuff in there.

590
00:57:53,010 --> 00:57:58,500
You gotta write. You've gone on a tangent and babbled on for five too many pages, right?

591
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:01,410
If you've got I've had people be like, Oh, I think we're done.

592
00:58:01,410 --> 00:58:06,510
But I only have seven pages and I'm like, That's not going to be in a paper, I can tell you that.

593
00:58:06,510 --> 00:58:09,510
Right? You don't have enough detail in something in there.

594
00:58:09,510 --> 00:58:17,350
Something's missing. Does that make sense? This is the rubric.

595
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:22,360
Hopefully it will help you figure out kind of what is supposed to be in there.

596
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:24,580
If you do have any questions, I'm happy to help.

597
00:58:26,740 --> 00:58:34,270
I will say for bibliography, since this is meant to be like a scientific type paper, you want peer reviewed journal articles.

598
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:40,350
The exception being like you can use the websites that we have discussed in this class.

599
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:44,860
Right? Like this here is your site is.

600
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:47,979
Yes, this guy's website is fine. You know, that's okay. Right?

601
00:58:47,980 --> 00:58:59,700
Those things that we use to classify our. But, you know, we're not referencing popular press articles or like website articles for this.

602
00:58:59,710 --> 00:59:08,920
You have to be careful during this. I will give you a sense, if you have a paper that's like from the 1990s, you should be looking for something new.

603
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:12,579
Or if you really can't find it. Talk to me about it.

604
00:59:12,580 --> 00:59:15,910
There's going to be a couple of days for in-class work and I'm having I will be here.

605
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:19,450
I'll be walking around. That's a great time to ask me those kinds of questions.

606
00:59:21,130 --> 00:59:24,430
Generally, anything more than like five, ten years old is pretty old.

607
00:59:25,510 --> 00:59:34,060
So if you particularly if it's like a review paper that you found like a good place to start is a review paper on like the epidemiology of cancer.

608
00:59:34,090 --> 00:59:39,520
Right. But if that review paper is from 1982 and it looks like it was written on a typewriter, that's a problem.

609
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:44,200
You probably need to look for one that's newer. Does that make sense? So I can help with that?

610
00:59:44,410 --> 00:59:49,030
Yeah. So he says, I'll any style.

611
00:59:49,390 --> 00:59:52,690
I just don't want the lives of people that are just any kind of public silence.

612
00:59:58,050 --> 01:00:02,280
Yeah. I don't really care which one it is. I just want numbers. Not I really hate.

613
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:06,569
I don't know. There's a couple of British journalists that like, make you do it that way with like last names in here.

614
01:00:06,570 --> 01:00:09,780
And I'm like, every time I'm reading a paper, I'm like, blah, blah, blah.

615
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:13,709
And then there's like 15 last names in a row and it like, it's hard to read.

616
01:00:13,710 --> 01:00:18,630
Like, it kind of breaks up your reading. Do you guys find that too? I'm like, Well, we're at the end of the sentence.

617
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:23,190
Where's the next thing I need to read that I care about? So. Numbers I think are better.

618
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:29,649
Okay? Yes. You know, you have new groups,

619
01:00:29,650 --> 01:00:34,780
but there are new groups and it's called Final Project 2022 because I learned my lesson

620
01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:38,200
about naming groups and candidates and if you name groups for enough years and they

621
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:42,309
all end up being named the same thing and you copy your friend because it doesn't

622
01:00:42,310 --> 01:00:46,690
associate that it thinks that you're associating your assignment with last year's groups,

623
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:50,230
not this year's groups. And that causes a big problem for me.

624
01:00:50,770 --> 01:00:58,610
So I learned my lesson. Any other questions?

625
01:01:00,470 --> 01:01:04,730
Okay. So here's the deal. We're going to go we're gonna look at the groups again.

626
01:01:06,380 --> 01:01:13,580
But I will say, if you go to today, the cancer registration thing, here's this final project survey.

627
01:01:14,750 --> 01:01:16,879
So only one person per group submit.

628
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:22,970
Please decide upfront who that's going to be because it's confusing when I get to, especially if they're different.

629
01:01:23,750 --> 01:01:31,280
But what you're going to see here is I've made a list here and you're going to choose three in order of your preference,

630
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:35,900
just say 1 to 3 and less than for me, for your group.

631
01:01:36,110 --> 01:01:40,250
If your group has another cancer that you feel really passionate about, let me know.

632
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:44,360
And I can, you know I can. I'll be walking around.

633
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:47,540
If you come up with something that you think you're really interested in, we can talk about it.

634
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:52,220
I don't want to like say no upfront, but there are some cancers that there's just not enough.

635
01:01:52,610 --> 01:01:57,020
There's so rare that it's hard to find enough information on them to really do a solid project,

636
01:01:57,740 --> 01:02:04,280
particularly about the ongoing research and like no growth factors kind of stuff.

637
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:10,490
So, so we can, we can think it through, but I think this is a pretty good list to start with.

638
01:02:10,850 --> 01:02:13,909
Okay, that makes sense. All right.

639
01:02:13,910 --> 01:02:31,899
Let's find your groups. All right.

640
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:40,980
There's four through eight. Start yelling out groups.

641
01:02:41,190 --> 01:02:44,819
Who's who's. Who's in for. Okay, go back there.

642
01:02:44,820 --> 01:02:49,950
That's for. Who's in? Five fives over there?

643
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:54,959
Who's in six sixes over here?

644
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:59,730
Our friend who's in seven? Seven is here.

645
01:03:01,590 --> 01:03:05,820
Who's in eight? It's back there in that corner.

646
01:03:11,390 --> 01:03:21,710
Hussein. One of the ones in that corner to me was kind of here in the middle, I guess.

647
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:26,730
Three threes back there.

648
01:03:41,810 --> 01:03:45,720
Yeah. How are you?

649
01:03:46,260 --> 01:03:52,290
How are you? I like to her.

650
01:03:53,440 --> 01:04:04,240
Because of us. Yeah.

651
01:04:12,710 --> 01:04:19,470
But I know that it seems obvious.

652
01:04:24,030 --> 01:04:28,050
Where's your ride? Hey, guys, where's group three?

653
01:04:28,260 --> 01:04:32,530
Right here. Do you remember how they all.

654
01:04:33,420 --> 01:04:39,010
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

655
01:04:39,020 --> 01:04:47,910
Very good. I think rescue they lived in.

656
01:04:49,100 --> 01:05:04,000
Yeah. Yeah.

657
01:05:04,460 --> 01:05:07,730
About. Yeah.

658
01:05:08,260 --> 01:05:13,710
I'm not supposed to. I don't know.

659
01:05:14,300 --> 01:05:18,400
I have a. Yeah.

660
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:23,650
You what I about. Yeah.

661
01:05:24,180 --> 01:05:32,390
I think I know a lot about speech rules, and I don't think that we can, honestly.

662
01:05:33,570 --> 01:05:52,080
Yeah, I don't. Or. I feel like I feel like I you a lot of information that like I feel like a kind of what we do we think choose.

663
01:05:54,040 --> 01:06:05,100
