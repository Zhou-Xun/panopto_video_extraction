1
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:28,190
Certainly some people just aren't going to be. Much.

2
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:07,700
But. Okay.

3
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:30,620
All right. Mostly. All right.

4
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,899
We can get started today.

5
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:39,110
We're going to talk about family separation.

6
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:42,630
And then I'd like to I'd like to preview that.

7
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:48,590
Next time, we'll talk about resilience and talk about the resilience maybe because I think this this whenever I do this session,

8
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:52,700
it feels like, you know, there's a lot of heavy topics here.

9
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,209
And it's not that we haven't already discussed heavy topics,

10
00:01:56,210 --> 00:02:05,450
but I feel like this issue and all the ways we can well discuss really brings together a lot of

11
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:09,499
what we've been already thinking about in terms of development and relationships and stressors.

12
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:15,319
But we will be turning to talk about resilience more also next week.

13
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:23,209
So today we'll talk about just family separation as well as delve into a little bit more biology.

14
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:30,350
So I realized last time we talked a lot about the amygdala and we'll talk a little bit more about stress biology today and again,

15
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:38,530
sort of as an overview way so that again, you guys have like a basis and you know, if they're like physiology majors in here,

16
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:41,780
you have much more of a basis and that's that I want to talk about today.

17
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:45,889
And then these readings will kind of touch on each of them.

18
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:55,400
This one is really from that publication, the conversation, which if people are familiar with that, I think it does a really good job of.

19
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:00,619
I forget their tagline that's like science with journalistic flair or something.

20
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:05,929
And I think they do a good job of kind of highlighting key issues, pulling in the science.

21
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:11,450
They often have really good links to scientific research, but they make it accessible.

22
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:18,859
And so I think that's a really that's an example of just a good piece to keep

23
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:22,189
in mind share with colleagues who've sort of never delved into this space.

24
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:29,960
Maybe like, Oh, you want to know about brain development stress. Here is a good like to page or on that as it relates to child development.

25
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:37,489
And then the to the West article is one that's really specifically focused on fathers.

26
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:41,990
And can I think it's another good example of a write up and description of intervention so

27
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:47,059
we can talk about that and also qualitative data and then that ARC intervention piece.

28
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:54,950
I like it. I know it's kind of old, it's from 2005, but it's again a really great brief description of like, here's the deal.

29
00:03:56,060 --> 00:04:01,280
Like, here's what we mean by sort of the importance of trauma informed care, why self-regulation is important.

30
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:10,580
And it kind of is very like a cookbook of here's some steps to think about if you have, you know, a child or a family who has experienced trauma.

31
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:18,020
And I think that that's good to, again, like kind of have in your back pocket, even if you're not going to be doing like therapy with a child.

32
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:24,710
But you might have a family that you encounter in some professional context that could benefit from some of this info.

33
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:35,540
Okay. So we will get into talking about family separation and I think we can think about lots of different reasons,

34
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:43,819
many of which are super squarely, I think, in the domain of public health around family separation.

35
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:52,160
And just sort of reviewing this list, you know, this is a sampling, but the these kind of separations,

36
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:57,620
most of these are pretty big compared to the other kinds of separations we've talked about.

37
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:01,069
So we've talked about like that daycare on a daily separation basis.

38
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:04,850
We've talked about the attachment, strange situation, paradigm.

39
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:17,840
And then these are, you know, bigger separations often, you know, not by intent, not intended out of people's control,

40
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:26,150
perhaps unexpected, maybe planned for and desired at some level, but like still stressful to undergo.

41
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:35,780
And just sort of thinking about these examples, what would you guys say characterizes each of these?

42
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:40,939
I've said some things and what makes these sort of like similar or different to each other?

43
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:45,410
We can we'll talk about the kind of different types of stress that each of these

44
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:50,629
or certain examples of these separations can induce on children and families.

45
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:53,840
But what are some thoughts that spring to mind?

46
00:05:54,200 --> 00:06:00,979
Yeah, Kelly, I think one thing that maybe goes for all of these is that it's like stressful for the child.

47
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:07,290
And also there's a level of stress for the parent. So like as opposed to like dropping yourself into daycare, that might be stressful.

48
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:15,860
Like, you know, it's hard, but like if you have to give your child up to foster care or if you're incarcerated or sick or,

49
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:21,050
you know, deployed, that's going to have a level of stress for the parent as well.

50
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:25,180
Oh, absolutely. Okay.

51
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:34,820
I'm done with that. Absolutely. Thinking about what the parents perspective is and that idea of, I mean,

52
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:42,090
this is a population incarcerated mothers and I've worked with a fair bit and just even within that population,

53
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:46,920
just thinking so much and talking with parents about their ongoing relationship with their child,

54
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:51,659
even if it's not present in the moment, you know, is really a powerful thing to think about.

55
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:59,670
So absolutely. Considering parents, parents experiences and all of these, what else?

56
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:06,060
What other thoughts? Yeah, I would say that some of them are having an end date and others don't.

57
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:10,410
You can, you know, like if your parents are divorced, you're going to be with one parent for this week and next week.

58
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:13,410
Or like if you're in foster care,

59
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:20,130
you don't necessarily know if or when it would be for you to fight with your parents when military deployments usually have an end date.

60
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:26,060
So there's like something to look forward to. Or it might be easier to conceptualize.

61
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:30,950
Yes. Absolutely. Absolutely. So we'll talk about that.

62
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:33,170
And yes, sometimes it's expected.

63
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:43,220
There's usually kind of a transition process, at least in most of the years and those with an acceptable end date, even if it changes.

64
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:47,730
But that can be something to plan around, both for the child and for the parent.

65
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,840
Absolutely. Think about really little kids.

66
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:56,140
If that end date is a year from now or a month from now, it might feel really similar.

67
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:57,870
It's both like a long time. Right.

68
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:04,760
So that's sort of like our understanding of cognitive development is important in terms of framing that expected end date.

69
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:16,940
Any other thoughts? We'll talk a little bit more about some of these in more depth.

70
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:25,640
But I think certainly, I mean, think about what's happened this week in Florida, thinking about these in particular.

71
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:31,429
These are like in this. These are all really big changes where it takes child out.

72
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:36,290
Also, not only from maybe a parent, they might be with their parent, but it's out of a familiar context.

73
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:44,780
And so kind of, you know, if you're with you could be with your parent in any of these kinds of situations.

74
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:53,690
But you're sort of away from the familiar and you've probably had some sort of traumatic stress that you've experienced in any of those situations.

75
00:08:53,690 --> 00:09:05,130
And so the child might have had, you know, some levels of stress in these other situations as well.

76
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:09,589
But these are sort of these bigger social contextual factors.

77
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:13,579
And again, that's why I think like a lot of the students live in the space of public health.

78
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:23,300
So just using the really concrete example of Florida, there are certainly public health professionals working there now who are probably encountering,

79
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:31,570
you know, families who have experienced separation or little kids who don't know where their parents are, for example, and.

80
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:43,700
And so I think that on another level, we can think about some of these and we'll talk again in more depth about some of them, but is policy.

81
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:55,770
So I think immigration policy separation at the border is certainly policy that's really tragic and is is right now

82
00:09:55,770 --> 00:10:03,059
receiving more attention in terms of what the heck are we doing and what is going on and what are we allowing.

83
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:09,600
But I think policy changes and how these separations, whether they're expected or unexpected,

84
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:17,399
can happen or do happen is an important potential also space for public health to think about,

85
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:21,540
to intervene, and that those of us who are interested in, you know, child and family health in particular.

86
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:26,430
Yeah, I just this as I have pulled up my computer today,

87
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:35,220
the news that the federal courts said the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy is now illegal.

88
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:42,690
And so I don't know what it fully means yet. I just was reading the article that grabbed me.

89
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:48,209
I was like, okay, this kind of relates actually to this topic.

90
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:54,750
It really does relate to this topic. And that's been so we can can unpack that.

91
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:58,770
And we do have a session where we're talking about that.

92
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:03,749
And that is I don't know what I don't I haven't seen that headline.

93
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:12,450
Yeah, I'm sorry, I, I have, but I always in that session, I have noticed over the years,

94
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:18,599
there's always just I mean, that's presumably, you know, many of us probably are tracking that topic anyway,

95
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:31,290
but the details of what changes and where this is, what the status is of that DOCA issue, legislation, rights and policies are constantly changing.

96
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:34,890
So that's, uh, troubling news.

97
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:44,399
We can yeah. And that, and the great example of this big picture policy that is going to pretty immediately

98
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,670
have a lot of implications for the individual lives of children and families.

99
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:53,100
So that's why I feel like in this class I'm always like really big picture and really tiny picture.

100
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:57,780
And like, I think that's that is kind of the beauty of where like public health can go.

101
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,690
And that's what I spend a fair bit of time, like delving into it. I'm still grading the baby's papers.

102
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:12,600
It's just like I'm reading not a thing. Like, yeah, but like all of those little my new observations that I was asking you guys to make in the papers,

103
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,249
like all of those could be sort of applied in these contexts.

104
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:23,670
If you're the person who's like on the ground, you know, managing the implementation of some, you know,

105
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:30,299
horrible policy and trying to make it more workable for children and families like what are the implications for those children and families.

106
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:35,010
So hopefully that will that makes sense to you.

107
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:46,649
That's true. Okay. So and speaking of immigration, I just wanted to highlight some work that happens here in our department.

108
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:53,459
And Beachy Bill Lopez is someone who's worked a lot in this space and in Washtenaw County.

109
00:12:53,460 --> 00:13:02,850
And I always like to point out, I don't know if people have seen this book before, but that was that book came from his dissertation.

110
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:10,510
So like, you know, it was one of those experiences where, you know, he spent years and years and years thinking about,

111
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:16,229
you know, his PhD and writing his dissertation and doing all this research. And then rare for a dissertation,

112
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:22,830
it kind of was able to transition into a book of describing the experiences of

113
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:27,900
families in Washtenaw County and the impacts of immigration raids on those families.

114
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:38,520
So I think Phil's work is also an example of kind of an effective way to reach the public with,

115
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:43,559
you know, research based, you know, research and observations.

116
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:49,170
And so I like to highlight that for that reason as well as just for the topics.

117
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:55,290
So immigration related policies have implications not only for border separation of families,

118
00:13:55,290 --> 00:14:03,810
but also in terms of how we kind of treat families in terms of their their family lives, really, and what rates mean.

119
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:08,040
This is another book called Separated, unfortunately.

120
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:13,919
Same title, but it makes sense, right? The same title. And that's looking more at the bigger picture.

121
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:21,300
So I would say Bill's book is looking more at this like individual family context as impacted by the big policies separation.

122
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:24,600
And then this is looking much more at the border separation.

123
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:32,309
And then there is also a recent feature over the summer just talking about kind of everything that's going on in the news.

124
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:37,490
Right. Now around the border, separation policies and the implications on families.

125
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:44,069
So for people interested in those issues in particular, want to highlight those again,

126
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:52,170
kind of I don't say pop culture but like accessible resources that are helpful to to to look, look through.

127
00:14:53,580 --> 00:15:06,720
Another unfortunate COVID related source of separation is that a lot of kids have had parents who died during COVID of all ages.

128
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:14,490
But of course, studies are coming out now to sort of, you know, document the impact of this disaster of the pandemic.

129
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:25,319
And it's quite a lot of children. So one thing to think about is, of course, the disproportionality of the pandemic.

130
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:36,520
So kids who have lost parents have. And I don't want to say often, but not uncommonly lost, both parents or all caregivers.

131
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:43,280
And so we'll talk more about through the foster care system. But there's a lot to think about if a child loses both parents.

132
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:51,490
There's lots of things that challenge one parent. But both parents for all caregivers are deceased.

133
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:55,930
And that's a bigger issue even for kids in terms of separation and what to do now.

134
00:15:56,230 --> 00:16:07,540
And as we've talked about before, these rates of caregivers and parents who are who died are highest in the communities that are

135
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:12,720
hardest hit by the pandemic and are experiencing all sorts of additional community level traumas.

136
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:16,870
I wanted to say a word here for those interested in this topic.

137
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:27,370
There's this concept of complicated grief. Grief is a complicated process anyway, for for those of us who have experienced that.

138
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:35,379
But there's this kind of concept that actually just got acknowledged in the the DSM,

139
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:42,190
which is like that psychiatry book that sort of classifies everybody's different mental health conditions.

140
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:47,860
And the issue of complicated grief has been discussed for many, many years.

141
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:56,880
And it's basically this question of like what happens to sort of make grief kind of more awful than it needed to be, in a sense.

142
00:16:56,890 --> 00:17:02,980
And it's these components which are contexts of uncertainty, fear,

143
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:08,800
community level trauma and sort of limited ability to say goodbye or process the death.

144
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:13,030
And that is exactly right what has happened with COVID.

145
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:17,319
And so thinking about the impact that is rippling on and on and on,

146
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:24,400
on all these kids and families who have experienced this is really a lot to consider.

147
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:32,110
I would also highlight here, this is a great resource for for people, for kids, for families,

148
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:41,140
for professionals around what to do if you're working with or just interacting with families who have experienced this.

149
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:49,390
They've the National Child Traumatic Stress Network particularly, has a lot of resources for young kids.

150
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:57,129
They talk about relational health. They're very thoughtful about how they present this information.

151
00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:08,320
It's all very, I would say, like research back to science based and give us practical tools because I think that this

152
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:14,680
is just a huge issue that I just sort of put up this like statistics and figure or,

153
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:21,430
you know, paper. But more is, of course, coming out around these issues all the time.

154
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:26,950
And we really just need to think about how we're going to manage to help our kids through this and our families.

155
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:39,610
The and then also has resources for some resources resources for sort of non clinicians and clean up and non clinical settings,

156
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:44,440
which is important because again like we're not clinicians necessarily in this

157
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,769
room but we are going to be in settings where children and families are.

158
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:53,050
And so if there's ways to think about remember we talked about that room like the physical setting,

159
00:18:53,410 --> 00:19:00,910
if there's ways to think about making whatever setting, we end up in more sort of child and family friendly and trauma aware.

160
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:06,790
I think that's important because we just have so many kids who are in this situation.

161
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,400
And unfortunately. Okay. I know it's a lot.

162
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,850
And so this I also just want to put this in from where you guys are.

163
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:21,410
I know this font is really small, but. And I'm never supposed to say that talk.

164
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:26,240
I know you can't see this, but I put the arrow here.

165
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:34,220
This is Michigan. And this is just sort of showing where Michigan falls in terms of the number of kids who have lost the primary caregiver.

166
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:38,810
This number goes up to 125,000.

167
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:44,780
And so Michigan is like 75, 70, something like that roughly.

168
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:59,389
And this is the race demographics. So we have here non-Hispanic white kids in the gray, non-Hispanic black kids in the kind of green, non Asian,

169
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:06,140
non-Hispanic, Asian, American, Indian, red and blue and then Hispanic kids and then this kind of yellow color.

170
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:13,490
So that's that graph. Um, so Michigan's high not at the top, but it's pretty high up there.

171
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:22,580
So thinking about the number of kids who are experiencing this in Michigan is quite high, blocking out that color key here.

172
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:31,370
Looking at these graphs, this is showing, again, the number of children who lost their primary caregiver overall in this total graph.

173
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:33,860
And as you basically get more blue, it's higher.

174
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:44,820
So here in Texas and California, if we think about the context of those states, there's a lot of agricultural workers, there's a lot of, you know,

175
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:55,700
lack of services, rural areas, city areas, tribal populations, like lots of reasons for a lot of underlying a lot of these numbers and colors.

176
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:03,260
And then this is just all of the red are just looking kind of broken out by race,

177
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:11,450
group and ethnicity with more red going up to between five and 12,000 kids in the reddest color,

178
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:16,820
the number of kids who have lost a primary got a primary caregiver in this state.

179
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:22,229
So that's just another sort of more sort of a graphic we're just talking about.

180
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:28,520
It figures in presentations and things, but sometimes it is important to just have access,

181
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:33,079
to be able to quickly show like, hey, this is the scope of the problem.

182
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:39,170
Like, again, we did strike me the other day as we were sitting here and said like in ten years, like,

183
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:45,319
people are not going to have as much of a lived experience of COVID and it will fade into the background to some degree.

184
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:52,520
And I think it already has started to rise. So it's just important to kind of keep that keep that on our radar.

185
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:57,170
Okay. Any questions?

186
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:02,650
Considerations. Okay. Um, okay.

187
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:07,570
So in terms of it's kind of bringing it down to like the child and family scale a little bit more,

188
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:12,460
um, if we're thinking about grief or even other kinds of separation.

189
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:16,870
So we have some immediate things to think about, right? And thinking about again like this.

190
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,420
There's probably an example every single week.

191
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:28,450
I know there is, but I'm thinking about like, you know, there's flooding in Florida or other other other things that are happening.

192
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:31,329
Kids are going to have these overwhelming emotions.

193
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:38,350
And while we know from thinking developmentally, those look very different across infancy to adolescence.

194
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:42,520
And so an infant, you know, might be just totally disregulated.

195
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:45,669
They don't get it. They don't know what's going on. Same thing with a toddler, right?

196
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:52,989
Those toddler tantrums, like they can look really the same even if they're coming from like a a place of deep grief or a sort of like,

197
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:57,040
grocery store frustration. Like, those behaviors can look similar.

198
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,510
Um, kids may be inappropriately worried about safety.

199
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:06,010
What's going to happen to me? They may not be able to voice that very well, depending on their age.

200
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:13,240
Right? So they may look like they're just kind of being annoying or bratty or having a tantrum, but they really may be having these big,

201
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:19,600
overwhelming worries and especially, again, for these young kids, but even for older kids.

202
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,110
Right. All of us would be worried and scared in these kinds of situations.

203
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:28,990
Their attachment figure isn't there to help them kind of regulate and cope with those emotions.

204
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:34,060
So they have this intense need and the attachment figure is not there.

205
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:38,020
And those are, I would say, like pretty immediate needs.

206
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:46,659
And then if we think about over time how this might play out, so again, this can be over years, right?

207
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:53,590
So kids can sort of develop anger or resentment about the caregiver, even if they like cognitively.

208
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:56,800
No, my caregiver couldn't do anything about that.

209
00:23:57,490 --> 00:24:03,490
This bad thing happened. But I can still you know, I can still be angry at my caregiver about that.

210
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:08,680
And that's certainly something that we see all the time that.

211
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:18,070
Yeah, check back who's here in psychiatry wrote that article about in the conversation about that sort of increased stress, reactivity and fear.

212
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:22,780
And that's back to the amygdala. Like the amygdala experiences all this threat and stress.

213
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:31,180
It can kind of reshape the brain to be highly reactive to new situations over time.

214
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:37,719
We can certainly see a lot of different mental health concerns that are associated with that separation,

215
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:42,490
really separations that are that are stressful, unexpected, etc.

216
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:52,809
And then sort of a little more mildly than, you know, mental health diagnosis, but challenges with expressing emotions,

217
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:58,900
coping, adaptively trusting other people because you've got hurt, you know, by your caregiver.

218
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:04,510
You don't feel like you can invest in other people and developing social relationships,

219
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:08,649
which then of course can impact one's options for coping and social support.

220
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:19,059
So just sort of spelling out those steps, this is why it's important to understand these potential impacts,

221
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:27,880
be on the lookout for them, and then also think about ways to support kids and families who've been through these to these situations.

222
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:37,750
Okay. One thing that is also critical to take away is that how a separation is handled.

223
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:44,560
And again, sometimes we don't have very good options and we're like choosing among bad options of how to handle a horrible event.

224
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:53,980
But we do know that how a separation is handled can help determine how it impacts the child and the parent.

225
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:01,930
So, you know, if there's any degree of preparation that one can do for the child,

226
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:09,670
if there's any way to sort of highlight or build in expectation of when the separation might end, that's important.

227
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:16,989
And I would argue it's really important also to do it at the developmentally appropriate way, because if a child's parent, for example,

228
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:28,340
has just been sentenced to 25 years in prison to a child, that is that just that length of time is incomprehensibly long.

229
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:35,620
Right. So to a young child. And so how do you kind of manage expectations in that that context?

230
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:45,969
So we can talk more about that. One thing that one program that I like to kind of highlight is that a number of years

231
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:51,940
ago and it's kind of merged into different or merged merged into different programs,

232
00:26:51,940 --> 00:27:00,040
but there's been some work with police in doing ride alongs where they took along someone who was like an infant child,

233
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:09,459
infant mental health person, basically. And so police officers would be called to some seen and often interpersonal violence

234
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:14,800
or domestic violence scene and there'd be a little kid and the police's you know,

235
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:19,780
the police kind of concerns or between the adults because the adults are going to be, you know, hurting each other.

236
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:24,100
But the little kid is also there witnessing all of this.

237
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:36,190
And so there was sort of an effort to to alert and highlight to the police force members that, you know, how to handle the little kid.

238
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:39,580
And it's not that the little kid is unaffected because they're just sitting in a corner.

239
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:47,260
And one of the details that I really remember hearing about this program was that the kid who wants to then go with the police officer,

240
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:51,010
you know, immediately, that's not actually a great sign.

241
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:57,660
That's actually a sign of sort of a disrupted attachment and like what we call indiscriminate attachment.

242
00:27:57,670 --> 00:28:05,739
So, like, the child is not sticking with the parent, but the child's going with kind of the the new stranger, which we actually see.

243
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:10,260
It's not a great idea. Like the child should be sort of upset and distressed about going with the stranger.

244
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:18,790
So just sort of this idea of like infusing an appreciation of what's going on for little kids in particular because they're harder to read,

245
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:26,290
is important for any professional who might come across these guys, especially under conditions of, you know, stress.

246
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:34,930
Okay. So I keep saying stress. We talked about this a little bit, but I'll just kind of dove into a little bit.

247
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:42,430
And so that you guys have this for your info, this sort of biological and really biobehavioral stress process.

248
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:52,000
So this article is talking about how you appraise stressful events and that how that interfaces with your physiology.

249
00:28:53,170 --> 00:29:01,000
I will say like in the world of, like, um, like, like psychology of emotions, people talk a lot about like,

250
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:05,379
do you first appraise something and then you and then you conceptualize what that is like?

251
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:14,050
Do you have a physiological response and then decide, Oh, that was a happy response or excited response or a sad response.

252
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:20,410
But this is this is a whole complex process, basically.

253
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:29,980
But what's key here in thinking about health outcomes is that these physiological stress processes really interface and can damage over time,

254
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:34,990
which I'll talk a little bit about other sort of body systems that are responsible for maintaining our health.

255
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:45,430
So they interface with the immune system and can create inflammation, which over time we've talked about chronic stress.

256
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:49,180
If that isn't reduced, that can be damaging to health.

257
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:59,630
The other thing here, so you have this negative emotional response, your body's kind of flooded for the stress physiology hormones here.

258
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:06,430
Here's a point where you can also act in your behaviors to kind of make those feelings go away.

259
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:13,719
And I'll talk more about eating behavior, but eating behavior is kind of a classic thing that we do to make those feelings of stress go away.

260
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:20,709
Because actually, when we consume foods that are high in sugar, fat and salt, it's physiologically soothing and may have already said that.

261
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:25,270
And I'm sure I'll say it again, but this is something that can really become ingrained.

262
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:35,250
And again, if it's at an early age, it might be a hard habit to. If you engage in these maladaptive coping processes.

263
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,459
And that's kind of what I've been saying, is that the stress can become embedded.

264
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:45,750
And particularly the stress physiology and these responses that can be really unconscious

265
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:50,850
and unintentional can result in negative physical and mental health outcomes over time.

266
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:55,560
And we've also talked about the intergenerational transmission.

267
00:30:55,560 --> 00:31:01,930
So if you think about, you know, a pregnant woman in Florida right now whose house was just destroyed by, you know,

268
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:10,640
the surge, storm surge, she has those stress hormones flooding through her body and potentially affecting the fetus.

269
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:18,270
So lots of different ways for this stress to get under the skin to a lot of that stress.

270
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:27,209
Researchers talk about it if if people want to dove further into this again, like here's like I would I would say it's like a good,

271
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:32,220
accessible book written by a stress researcher called Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers.

272
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:37,350
And it's this idea that our physiological stress response is really important.

273
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:41,969
It's actually critically important for our survival. Right? Like we have to have a stress response,

274
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:50,130
otherwise we just would die immediately because we don't have any signal that we need to change something about the environment.

275
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:59,760
Cortisol is an example of a stress hormone that in sort of a healthy pattern responds to a stressor.

276
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:08,040
So like increases when stress happens, 20 minutes of stress and then it recovers after the body has received a feedback like,

277
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:15,960
Oh, that stress is gone, you don't need to worry about it anymore. What happens under conditions of chronic stress is that you can have this response

278
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:21,600
without an opportunity for recovery so that your body's just constantly on high alert.

279
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:26,399
And that's when these sort of damaging patterns happen the way zebras don't get ulcers.

280
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:32,190
Thing is, the idea that like a zebra is not going to stick around long enough to be like chronically stressed.

281
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:36,120
They're just going to run and they're going to activate their acute stress response.

282
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:41,000
And then the stress passes. And if they don't get eaten, then it declines, right?

283
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:49,890
And so hopefully a child is not hitting it, but they could be in these conditions of chronic stress and they can't run.

284
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:54,000
And so I think some of the resilience movie goes into a few examples like that.

285
00:32:55,710 --> 00:33:00,360
And so this is the idea that the stress response system is really, really critically important.

286
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:03,150
So we always talk about like stress is bad, toxic stress,

287
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:08,370
but remember like one of those first readings talks about positive stress and it's like it's alerting.

288
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:12,960
It's important, like it's important to respond to because our body is saying like,

289
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:19,530
holy moly, something's happening out there and we need to change the situation.

290
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:27,120
That's acute stress and then chronic stress. We have limited recovery opportunity for recovery.

291
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:35,220
It's been I mentioned that the HP axis, which is the one that I happened to study, interacts with these other physiological systems.

292
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:44,520
And the idea and we did this is kind of what I was saying in my like long response to the amygdala about the amygdala the other day.

293
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,169
But it is this idea,

294
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:57,329
this like premature maturation or like early embedding of of hyper responsiveness to stress can really reduce cognitive flexibility.

295
00:33:57,330 --> 00:33:59,159
And if you think about that in terms of the zebras,

296
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:06,840
it makes sense because a zebra who is like faced with a lions did not sit there and go, oh, I'm so cognitively flexible.

297
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:14,940
Should I run? So I try to hide so that, you know, we might be able that's a good thing for humans to do, but like not for zebras.

298
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:20,850
And so that zebra should only go to a single stress response, and that is to run.

299
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:25,890
And so if you're a little kid who is experiencing all these stressors in your life,

300
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:32,009
you may not develop the opportunity for that cognitive flexibility because you don't have very many

301
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:38,040
good options and you have to just like take the survival option and it just sort of winnows down

302
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:44,489
your kind of ultimate capacity to like generate new solutions and might problem solve because

303
00:34:44,490 --> 00:34:51,780
your environmental options are so limited if people are familiar with the weathering hypothesis.

304
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:55,140
Arlington Anonymous is a colleague in this department.

305
00:34:55,590 --> 00:35:05,970
She talks a lot about this in terms of women and kind of African-American women who have grown up with chronic stress or sort of prematurely aging.

306
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:11,820
And there's data to show this like some at a cellular, cellular level.

307
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:22,080
And it's kind of this process like your stress level, if it's chronic, it's just sort of impeding your ability to have these other options.

308
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:28,710
Okay. So that's at a very biological level. And we talk about a lot in public traffic, that sort of bigger social context.

309
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:34,130
But that's the kind of connection to the body. Okay.

310
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:39,880
Here, I'm going to click through this. This is an idea of with cortisol like this.

311
00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:45,770
What's an example of why this stress process and biological stress is a little bit messy?

312
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:54,349
So if you get into this area, especially in research, it'll be like, oh, my gosh, the data are all over the place because of things like this.

313
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:59,120
So you can have this like stressful events. This is your social context, highly stressful,

314
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:04,160
that your stress response initially is really responsive to those events because you're trying to be like the zebra.

315
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:12,080
But then over time, as they continue, you mount less of a stress response, plus the physiological stress response.

316
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,650
And what happens then to your sort of this is diurnal pattern.

317
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:22,610
So speaking of not for one moment, but cortisol is supposed to have a normal response to stress and decline.

318
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:29,780
If you have this all the time, you eventually can develop like a hypo pattern where you're not mounting a stress response,

319
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:34,970
so you're not alert and you're not kind of responding to your environment.

320
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:43,310
And we see that sometimes, like in the case of depression, people have a low of cortisol response and if we try to stimulate it.

321
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,500
So what's going on there? I think that's the end of the biology tour,

322
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:52,760
but I just wanted to kind of talk to that one because I think it illustrates here's

323
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:57,200
one central mechanism that we get the stress in the environment into our bodies.

324
00:36:57,650 --> 00:37:02,970
And also this is why, like development of time matter so much.

325
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:09,320
Okay. Oh, sorry. There's hyper that comes on really slowly. I don't know how to speak of that.

326
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:17,930
Okay. So back to that idea of, you know,

327
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:25,639
why and what we're what we can do if children have to face this stress and like the idea

328
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:32,660
of how you manage a stress for a child is deterministic at some level of how they cope.

329
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:39,860
We know from a lot of different literature, lots of different situations is that separation is generally worse,

330
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:43,720
leading to more stress if we're unprepared for it.

331
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:50,720
So if it's a shock to the literal shock to the system, if children are younger because we haven't,

332
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:55,670
you know, it could be like set that, you know, hyper response to threat in motion.

333
00:37:56,750 --> 00:38:05,080
Also, if they can't understand what's going on and they don't have access to a caregiver, the stress is longer or the separation is longer.

334
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:10,220
That makes sense. The end point, as Annie said, was, is uncertain.

335
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:17,450
And the reason is uncertain, too. Like there's there's uncertainty in the system that can create greater stress.

336
00:38:17,810 --> 00:38:20,990
And this idea of limited social emotional support that the caregiver.

337
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:27,610
Okay. Any.

338
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:31,839
I know. I've been talking a lot. Any questions?

339
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:45,790
Thoughts in terms of that that issue of like how might that also how might this

340
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:50,980
kind of be possible to kind of address if you're facing a situation where,

341
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:58,000
you know, separations have to occur, some disasters occur and your, you know,

342
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:05,590
the person who's like in charge or topped with figuring out what to do for a little kid or for a family.

343
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:12,650
Any ideas? Hmm.

344
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:23,749
Mean, I was just that it's so loud out there. So I was thinking in the context of, like, the limited preparation, like having come on,

345
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:31,900
suddenly you can instead of you can kind of make up for that later like, oh, people just happened suddenly.

346
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:35,900
The less prepare you for what the next steps are going forward and dealing with that.

347
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:40,010
So it's not a constant like wondering and worried.

348
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:43,570
Being worried if something like that's gonna happen. Mm hmm. Absolutely.

349
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:49,280
And that is a great therapeutic technique. And you do reduce that uncertainty when you do that.

350
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:53,179
Right. You like practice. And I think we've all probably done this a little bit.

351
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:57,530
Like, you have to get up and give a talk or you have to you know, you have something that's making you like worry.

352
00:39:58,490 --> 00:40:04,580
And so can you forecast even if you didn't do it for the the like initial event,

353
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:09,890
can you forecast what that might be like in the future and how that might be handled in the future?

354
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:18,050
Um, and that is also, I would say for social emotional support after the fact.

355
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:32,090
Yeah. Other thoughts or ideas or come out with parents who are anticipating, you know, different things happening?

356
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,930
Yeah. Oh, you know, um.

357
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:51,800
Any thoughts of what to do next? I guess just offering support and education for them.

358
00:40:52,790 --> 00:41:00,499
Know how to deal with children, how to handle for children during this like rough time and how to build the strength within

359
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:08,180
them to be able to build that resiliency and enjoy the child so that they can be able to give.

360
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:12,050
I mean, some of them before the separation.

361
00:41:12,410 --> 00:41:16,190
Mm hmm. Yeah. And I would say absolutely.

362
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:23,900
And that everything I was just discussing about stress in the brain and the article, all of those things,

363
00:41:24,170 --> 00:41:30,620
I think it is again, it's back to like having a balance, but you want to be able to highlight to a parent like,

364
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:37,160
you know, this, you want to do these things, do these steps of preparation for your child,

365
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:43,490
because even if you're not thinking about it, it could actually have these impacts for your child.

366
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:51,260
You don't want to raise alarm necessarily for parents who are, you know, anticipating the separation for their child.

367
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:54,140
And military deployment, I think is a good example of that.

368
00:41:54,920 --> 00:42:02,840
But you also want to give it its place and say there are things that your child may be showing later because of this

369
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:10,520
separation and this is why so kind of helping parents to maybe make those links not in an alarmist way like I was just doing,

370
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:13,730
but in a way that is like sort of contained and linked to.

371
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:18,440
And, you know, if you have a younger child, maybe these are the ways to talk about it.

372
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:25,910
Not all the time. For example, it might be very concrete, you know, try to build in as much certainty as you can say,

373
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:31,300
like, I don't know about this part, but I know that, you know, this will happen.

374
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:37,940
Or if it's like a military deployment, talking about, you know, what you know will happen,

375
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:43,849
like we will, you know, have this event and then I will go and then,

376
00:42:43,850 --> 00:42:53,270
you know, the things that you know and even if those things are separation, things kind of containing it for the child is really going to be helpful.

377
00:42:55,720 --> 00:43:03,700
I would also say that that yeah. And just like looking at this list, it makes me think a lot about like we know all of those things,

378
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:08,260
separation wars and still like the child welfare system is like based on all of these things.

379
00:43:08,270 --> 00:43:11,600
I guess all, almost all that's going to happen to like every child.

380
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:16,610
And I think it was like maybe an optional reading last week about like how the pandemic

381
00:43:16,610 --> 00:43:20,990
was like a unplanned experiment for like abolishing the child welfare system.

382
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:30,110
And I just agree with that so much because I it's so interesting that we know all this and we know how much trauma that instills in families and kids.

383
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:33,410
And we're still doing it. Yes.

384
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:47,690
Yes. And I think that we can point to lots of reasons why it happens and overburdening and racism and lots of things.

385
00:43:48,410 --> 00:43:55,910
But yeah, like these are these are fairly not always achievable, but like one could move in this direction.

386
00:43:56,990 --> 00:44:02,390
And even the most simple thing of like children are younger,

387
00:44:02,810 --> 00:44:14,540
like when is it truly necessarily necessary in the child welfare system to really remove young, young kids?

388
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:25,010
And certainly there are times when it is necessary, but like thinking at least twice, if not more, if you're talking about a kid who's under five.

389
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:31,320
We'll talk some more about foster care. But like siblings, right.

390
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:37,790
Siblings are really important point point source of social support for kids.

391
00:44:37,790 --> 00:44:41,839
And often siblings are separated because, again, it's kind of these practical,

392
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:47,930
logistical considerations like this home can't take two kids or it can't take an adolescent and a younger kid.

393
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:53,060
But that then kind of limits the social support potentially that a child might have with their siblings.

394
00:44:53,570 --> 00:45:03,440
And so I agree, these are kind of like helpful guidelines that, you know, certainly in child welfare, this is these are all really salient issues.

395
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:11,300
But I would argue like in lots of different ways, these could be helpful guideposts to think about figuring.

396
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:21,690
Yeah. I have too many thoughts on it.

397
00:45:23,010 --> 00:45:28,670
So I keep thinking of like when you're on the plane and they're like, Oh, yeah.

398
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:36,980
Like from, like a parent or caregiver perspective, like taking care of yourself first, which I struggle with some.

399
00:45:36,990 --> 00:45:42,540
Like how can you, how can you take care of yourself, but also then also still take care of the children.

400
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:45,689
So. Yeah. Looking at this list,

401
00:45:45,690 --> 00:45:55,400
it makes me also think of like the other list of like what resources do they have that they can amplify if it's like social support

402
00:45:55,410 --> 00:46:05,580
or program neighborhoods and going to school or trying to look at someone like those resources and that could be beneficial.

403
00:46:06,090 --> 00:46:15,959
Absolutely. And I think I want to things with the I think just the I use that oxygen mass picture all the time because it just resonates.

404
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:21,240
Right. And I think there is increasing appreciation that like parents do need to do that and

405
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:25,620
there's like a little bit of a maybe it's like a swing back in time or something,

406
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:31,889
but like an acknowledgment, like you do need to take care of yourself because like parenting and all of these pressures are really hard.

407
00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:37,260
And so there's just, I think just laying it out there is a, is an okay thing to do.

408
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:41,940
Like I think the mom and her program does is important and it kind of signals

409
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:49,080
like we acknowledge and societally or whatever that you as a parent need to,

410
00:46:49,170 --> 00:46:59,070
you know, be supported. Also, these things, you know, these things can be difficult to talk about, even if they seem kind of basic.

411
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:03,149
If you're like the parent in a situation and you're preparing your own kid.

412
00:47:03,150 --> 00:47:11,310
And so even getting words for how to talk about this stuff and how to talk about these things developmentally.

413
00:47:11,790 --> 00:47:15,599
That's why one of the reasons I give you guys a lot of those resources and websites,

414
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:19,620
because they often have like especially like the Sesame Street kids,

415
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:25,620
I think I was talking about like PBS kids, how to talk to your child about like illness.

416
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:30,239
Parent illness is something that I was talking to them about and sort of recently.

417
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:34,319
And it was about just these sort of simple ideas.

418
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:39,479
But if you're the person who's going to be like containing that for your kid,

419
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:49,770
like a try to get in as good an emotional place as you can be before you have that conversation with your kid again, not always possible.

420
00:47:50,220 --> 00:48:00,360
The other idea kind of building on what Carly's Carla was saying is that like practice these things, you know, early in in life, again,

421
00:48:00,370 --> 00:48:05,760
if it's possible in something like daycare and, you know, the attachment,

422
00:48:06,390 --> 00:48:12,480
strange situation protocol, those are opportunities to practice separation and reunion.

423
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:20,070
And it seems again sort of basic, but it helps the child sort of build stamina for separation.

424
00:48:21,030 --> 00:48:24,060
Um, so absolutely.

425
00:48:24,450 --> 00:48:33,150
I think the next yeah, that's kind of builds on this idea in the Walsh article about deployment and fathering.

426
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:43,620
Some of those quotes, I think in the paper really highlighted like, you know, how hard it can be to kind of come back from a separation.

427
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:53,060
So this is the idea of coming back into the family and even when you do have support, it's not easy necessarily, right?

428
00:48:53,070 --> 00:48:59,100
And it can depend a lot on child age prior relationship quality with the parent.

429
00:48:59,730 --> 00:49:05,100
You know how much the child was told about the separation of why the child might be angry, like all sorts of things.

430
00:49:07,530 --> 00:49:08,730
I'll just pop these up here.

431
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:23,130
But I think that it's still important to remember that, like parenting challenges that are like run of the mill, like bedtime, are still there.

432
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:30,870
And when you throw like even a planned sort of short month long separation into there,

433
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:38,129
it can disrupt these sort of normal routines that are really important to try to hold on to, if you can, and certainly is bigger separation.

434
00:49:38,130 --> 00:49:44,580
So even talk about our routines kind of go out the window and this like like that's

435
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:49,140
another containing thing I think for parents that children may act out upon like return.

436
00:49:49,770 --> 00:49:55,440
So I think we talked about earlier the example of like, you know,

437
00:49:55,980 --> 00:50:00,990
meeting a young infant and then kind of come back and see the infant six months later,

438
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:05,370
an infant is like changed and they don't know who you are and they now have stranger anxiety.

439
00:50:05,790 --> 00:50:10,859
All those things can happen for a parent, too, right? So like, the infant might have been like, Oh, my lovely infant.

440
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:15,350
They were just born and I have to leave and I'm sad. And now I come back and they don't.

441
00:50:15,510 --> 00:50:18,659
Want to see me like they hit me. They don't they don't seem to like me.

442
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:26,309
Like that's really hard for a parent who's, like, been doing nothing but, like, thinking of how much I want to see that kid, you know?

443
00:50:26,310 --> 00:50:30,630
And then the kid's like, Who are you? You know, that is a really hard situation.

444
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:39,000
And so, again, in these plan separations, there's a lot we can do about, you know, telling the child, about the parent,

445
00:50:39,030 --> 00:50:43,019
talking about what the parents are doing and that they're thinking about that, you know, we can do a lot of things.

446
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:49,530
It's harder with younger kids, of course, because they just can't that can't conceptualize that very well yet.

447
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:56,520
But there's a lot we can actually provide to kids and to caregivers who might be in that situation.

448
00:50:56,610 --> 00:51:03,930
So, again, like thinking about, you know, resources we can provide parents for talking about these issues.

449
00:51:04,830 --> 00:51:07,649
And then the other thing, of course, is that parents may be stressed out.

450
00:51:07,650 --> 00:51:15,750
Parents have that whole stress process happening and that can impact, you know, how they, their like oxygen mask capacity.

451
00:51:16,410 --> 00:51:24,450
Um, and then here we've talked already about parent trauma and those like screening for parent aces,

452
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:28,079
but just sort of again building that awareness of parents like,

453
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:34,020
hey, you might not be thinking about this because you're like really busy trying to figure out what you're going to do with your,

454
00:51:34,050 --> 00:51:41,430
you know, reins of your house. But just sort of, you know, building in that awareness, like, I know you're stressed,

455
00:51:41,430 --> 00:51:45,450
but just reminding the parent, like your stress does affect the child.

456
00:51:45,810 --> 00:51:49,980
And here are some things to to do about that or ways to talk with your child about that.

457
00:51:50,850 --> 00:51:57,270
So don't like sweep it under the rug, but don't build, you know, anxiety, extra anxiety about it.

458
00:51:58,350 --> 00:52:02,090
Um. Okay.

459
00:52:04,530 --> 00:52:14,010
In terms of, Oh, yeah, I say this to you and I think I said this, but this idea of like reunification being a process and not just a single moment,

460
00:52:14,020 --> 00:52:20,460
like I think we've probably all seen those videos where like the parent comes home usually after deployment or some other separation,

461
00:52:20,970 --> 00:52:27,390
and it's like a surprise and it can be beautiful and amazing and it's like on a basketball court and it's like,

462
00:52:27,390 --> 00:52:31,020
Oh my gosh, that's just the most beautiful high point of parenting.

463
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:34,350
And like, oh, wow. But it can also go really wrong.

464
00:52:34,590 --> 00:52:44,790
Right? And so how you handle the moment of kind of, you know, seeing each other again is one thing to think about,

465
00:52:44,790 --> 00:52:51,029
but then also realizing like there's so many moments and which is great because you get lots of opportunities for repair.

466
00:52:51,030 --> 00:52:58,530
And we actually call it even in the still face, even in that like reunification episode, like we call it interactional repair, right?

467
00:52:58,530 --> 00:53:04,140
Like you had a disruption to the interaction and then you like do all this little repair things to kind of get it back.

468
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:10,410
And so again, I think just previewing that both for kids in a development appropriate way and for parents,

469
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:18,800
especially the person who is either containing the child, you know, while the other person is gone or the person who's coming back.

470
00:53:18,810 --> 00:53:24,990
All of those things are just important to kind of highlight around these separations.

471
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:26,420
Okay.

472
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:38,279
And so thinking about how we kind of can boil down these messages and like if you had to, for example, go, you know, to policymaker or, you know,

473
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:46,340
before Congress or something like that, to say like this is how we should deal with family needs and,

474
00:53:46,620 --> 00:53:50,370
you know, work on behalf of children and families.

475
00:53:50,370 --> 00:53:57,510
Because if you before Congress, you would also say because child well-being is really important and shapes the future of the nation.

476
00:53:58,830 --> 00:54:06,510
But really, you know, like these are ways that we can think about interventions for families and children have experience especially.

477
00:54:06,510 --> 00:54:10,110
These are like really intense separations for not good reasons.

478
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:19,139
So intervening early when the brain is more plastic and behaviors are flexible if you can, connecting children with alternate caregiver figures.

479
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:23,520
So we'll talk more about that, too, with families who have experienced incarceration,

480
00:54:24,330 --> 00:54:28,080
foster care is a great example as well of of alternate caregiver figure.

481
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:30,990
There's lots to consider there, but that's the idea, right?

482
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:40,350
One of the ideas behind foster care this is trauma informed care is needed both for the child like that, that attachment reading.

483
00:54:40,350 --> 00:54:44,160
I give you guys that little short reading, but also for the parent.

484
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:50,309
So I think that's like come up in our discussion throughout and then being aware,

485
00:54:50,310 --> 00:54:57,330
building that awareness that even if an immediate stressor has passed like it's not over necessarily with the separation being over,

486
00:54:58,290 --> 00:55:04,079
the trauma can be present and it can really affect behavior in those sort of basic ways that we see a lot of kids.

487
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:06,840
Right. It could be like, wow, you used to be potty trained.

488
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:13,469
And then now that daddy's back and it's all fine, now you're not potty trained and more like what's going on, right?

489
00:55:13,470 --> 00:55:16,710
So that's a classic example of developmental regression.

490
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:25,530
And so the idea is of like, well, what can we do? And it's kind of similar stuff to what we would do anyway with kids ideally, right?

491
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:30,540
But it's just like kids who have experienced the separation stress kind of need it more.

492
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:35,610
So just the idea of building routines like what can you put in place?

493
00:55:35,610 --> 00:55:40,680
And again, thinking about these big separations when you're out of your context or immigration,

494
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:49,080
you know, global conflict, flooding, lots of different things can really disrupt routines.

495
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:54,480
We'll talk more about housing instability. That is a big place where we have to think about routines for kids,

496
00:55:56,040 --> 00:56:01,709
establishing your social emotional supports in different settings so they may be new settings.

497
00:56:01,710 --> 00:56:14,610
You need to learn a new language. You need to meet some new people, like what's is is in that paragraph and then thinking kind of big picture,

498
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:20,610
it's like the public health pitch of how do we sort of buffer environments to help families.

499
00:56:20,610 --> 00:56:30,330
So again, thinking about all these kids who've lost parents to COVID, how can we think about like making better big picture environments for them?

500
00:56:30,510 --> 00:56:36,450
And one thing I would argue would be like to connect services and reduce barriers to

501
00:56:36,450 --> 00:56:41,609
accessing services that might provide some of these things basic needs services,

502
00:56:41,610 --> 00:56:46,019
social support services, mental health services. We'll talk more about that.

503
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:51,569
But those are really at some level kind of basic.

504
00:56:51,570 --> 00:56:53,639
But we all know they're difficult to achieve.

505
00:56:53,640 --> 00:57:00,210
And so just thinking strategically about how to build expectations for what's needed, I think is important.

506
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:14,070
And I think that that's what I've got the most people and I have four discussions like jamming through all the heavy topics.

507
00:57:14,070 --> 00:57:19,110
But we'll talk more about the resilience film next time.

508
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:26,790
And then I did also put in like a mid-point survey for you guys to complete just to give some feedback.

509
00:57:26,790 --> 00:57:31,529
And I, I do apologize in advance.

510
00:57:31,530 --> 00:57:35,700
Like you guys can tell, I got like really fired up about certain topics and talk a lot.

511
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:43,349
And I love having like whole group discussion and I feel like this room is difficult to like break people up.

512
00:57:43,350 --> 00:57:49,920
But definitely let me know if we want to do more like talk to your neighbor type discussions too, because that's always free.

513
00:57:50,430 --> 00:57:55,139
And yeah, I think I can pause and let you guys get to your next thing.

514
00:57:55,140 --> 00:58:01,620
But if anybody has questions or comments or paper questions, I'll hang out for a little while.

515
00:58:02,610 --> 00:58:06,379
So thanks, guys. Hmm.

516
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:27,780
Hmm. Hmm. We need to talk to you tomorrow to set up another time for office hours.

517
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:32,040
If you had availability on Fridays on Monday.

518
00:58:33,140 --> 00:58:39,360
Yeah, let's see. It depends on the week. And what next time?

519
00:58:39,780 --> 00:58:47,370
There's kind of like two parts. So, yeah, I'm working on for my capstone project for the Entrepreneurs class.

520
00:58:47,370 --> 00:58:56,730
I'm working on like discovery that's looking at stressors, stress impacts, parents.

521
00:58:57,510 --> 00:59:01,350
And I'd like to was like within parents. I mean, like stress.

522
00:59:01,620 --> 00:59:09,030
Yes, like all parents, yeah. Yeah. So it's not actually focused on the child, but still relieving.

523
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:17,700
But I'd like to review kind of what I have so far and kind of use it more like a it's a working brainstorming session versus like,

524
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:22,920
like a review and like critique, say with your expertize.

525
00:59:23,010 --> 00:59:31,950
Sure, I'm meeting with my mentor, also a mother tomorrow to get feedback from an actual parent to say like, what questions am I missing?

526
00:59:31,950 --> 00:59:38,069
What should I be including? It's kind of more like broad and first, well, you'll see,

527
00:59:38,070 --> 00:59:45,030
but just try to elicit as much information back without implementing like ideas in people's heads.

528
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:54,010
Yeah, yeah. I see what you're saying and that I feel like I'll end up having like the second part is I'll feel like I'll have questions.

529
00:59:54,010 --> 01:00:00,000
So I'm working more on the paper. I like did research, but I haven't had a chance to like read through it yet.

530
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:03,059
So that's what I was going to work on over the weekend.

531
01:00:03,060 --> 01:00:07,380
And I feel like I'll have some questions because I feel like from my research that I've done already,

532
01:00:07,950 --> 01:00:16,590
like starts to really incorporate like I'm doing toxic stress and chronic stress and really starts to incorporate like the parents.

533
01:00:16,950 --> 01:00:22,560
And so I'm wondering like, so I put that in or do I just try and keep it separate for this project?

534
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:29,490
Mm hmm. Mm. Yeah. So I it's it still feels very broad to me right now.

535
01:00:29,550 --> 01:00:38,760
Yeah. No, it is broad. You could go. I mean, I feel like this whole session thinking about, like, addressing stress of both is so important,

536
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:42,989
but also depending on, like what you'll actually be like trying to implement.

537
01:00:42,990 --> 01:00:52,889
Yeah. Like I feel like the next part of the paper of like intervention might lend itself then to the parent part time, right?

538
01:00:52,890 --> 01:01:01,650
Like you could sort of layout the space and then get to like basically like this is why an intervention in like lead me here.

539
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:07,799
Yeah. And that and then hopefully with like dovetail nicely with your because in the entrepreneur class is it are you

540
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:14,160
develop like as what's your task is developing an intervention the task is whatever you make it the long term goal.

541
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:21,840
Yes to like yeah build like whether it's a product or service or like something silly like what is your company idea?

542
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:25,590
But initially I had like some ideas and solutions.

543
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:29,129
Not in the children's space actually though, but for adults.

544
01:01:29,130 --> 01:01:35,400
And, and I backed away from Max because I was like, instead of actually like defining what a solution may be,

545
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:43,610
I just want to actually see like what they think problems and like defining what the solutions and what are the resources that these like,

546
01:01:43,620 --> 01:01:47,370
what do they actually think? And then I can put my innovative like lens on it.

547
01:01:48,210 --> 01:01:51,330
Um, so that is the end goal.

548
01:01:51,510 --> 01:01:59,069
And I'm hoping to also I'm using kind of like this class and that capstone product particularly to kind of dove into,

549
01:01:59,070 --> 01:02:04,800
like, discovering what my interests are and seeing where there is opportunity.

550
01:02:04,950 --> 01:02:15,010
Mm hmm. So it's. This purpose of the customer discovery, it's much more broad than just to really see patterns and.

551
01:02:15,610 --> 01:02:19,120
Yeah, so. Yeah, yeah, that sounds good.

552
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:26,019
That sounds good. Well, definitely. Yeah. And if you want to send me and if there's anything that's helpful to me to look at or anything, let me know.

553
01:02:26,020 --> 01:02:32,140
You let me know. And when is a time?

554
01:02:32,380 --> 01:02:37,000
Yeah, but actually, sadly, I ended up dropping my nutrition class.

555
01:02:37,180 --> 01:02:44,050
Oh, no. But only because for what I. What my goals are, I don't really need to know at the biochem level.

556
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:50,020
And it's a straight bio. Okay. Yeah, I know there's a lot of range that.

557
01:02:50,350 --> 01:02:56,440
Yeah, that's a lot. And I was like, I feel okay for me if it like also went into like the application of it,

558
01:02:56,440 --> 01:03:01,330
I was like understanding, okay, like what nutrition recommendations would you make then in this scenario?

559
01:03:01,780 --> 01:03:05,829
But it was so it started like the rest. It doesn't get there.

560
01:03:05,830 --> 01:03:09,489
Yeah. And so it's like a so deep into the molecular level.

561
01:03:09,490 --> 01:03:15,210
I was like, Oh, well, I don't know if I need to have that anyways because of that that freed up my schedule.

562
01:03:15,350 --> 01:03:20,559
Yeah. Well there's not a whole lot right.

563
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:23,590
Because you had, you were going to North Campus for something, right.

564
01:03:23,590 --> 01:03:26,740
One class. Yeah. Tuesday 37, north north campus.

565
01:03:27,490 --> 01:03:31,390
I have to look at schedule in my movement.

566
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:37,600
So pretty much Monday I'm free all day Friday and midday Wednesday.

567
01:03:37,660 --> 01:03:42,980
Yeah, Monday is tend to be pretty good. And let's see, I have a meeting here that I need to go to.

568
01:03:49,730 --> 01:03:58,840
I won't lie. I have a few meetings that day, but I that's kind of because I tend to schedule meetings on the 10th or.

569
01:04:01,180 --> 01:04:05,800
The 11th and 12th is kind of crazy.

570
01:04:06,430 --> 01:04:10,570
Oh, let's try it. Let's shoot for Monday if that works.

571
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:19,780
Okay. Like, I could do a, uh, I could do, like, 11 to noon.

572
01:04:20,260 --> 01:04:26,940
Okay. Yep. That's good. That good? Okay, let's try that. Yeah, I think.

573
01:04:30,870 --> 01:04:34,110
I think I should be in my office if you want to do in person.

574
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:37,860
Yeah, I'm stuck in person. Good. Good for this.

575
01:04:38,340 --> 01:04:41,840
Okay. Her office again. This like this? Yeah.

576
01:04:41,850 --> 01:04:47,670
So it's. The address is 30 718s page one.

577
01:04:51,810 --> 01:04:55,240
And the tricky thing is and then, you know, I'll be meeting with somebody from 10 to 1.

578
01:04:55,240 --> 01:04:59,340
And so this will be dealt with, but it's inside the Prevention Research Center.

579
01:04:59,410 --> 01:05:09,239
So I think I have seen that if you have a class right outside, yeah, it's like if you go up the stairs in there on the left on the way to the top,

580
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:12,960
and then you go in, there's like internal windows and it's in that suite.

581
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:22,890
So there's a door that should be open like all around it and go in the far door, but it's like on the way, the bathroom door.

582
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:28,049
Okay. Yeah. I mean, come over, then I'll send you. Okay?

583
01:05:28,050 --> 01:05:35,400
Yeah, that's perfect. That's perfect. And I think that that would be good.

584
01:05:35,850 --> 01:05:41,620
I gather that from today's lecture. Yeah. Because it's not been discussed in our schools.

585
01:05:41,670 --> 01:05:51,430
Uh huh. So I was like, I think the be scenarios like it's such a reminder me of like the military one like when a parent or caregiver is like

586
01:05:51,450 --> 01:05:59,830
reunited and then they have that feeling of like they're really disconnected or living someone else's life and they're like,

587
01:06:00,740 --> 01:06:06,630
Oh yeah, yeah. It sounds like they're like, it's not their life anymore.

588
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:13,210
And so then they like, ends up being like permanently, but that's like divorce or yeah.

589
01:06:13,250 --> 01:06:18,270
I mean, you start thinking of like, well, what if a parent doesn't want to do that?

590
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:26,790
And what are the, what are the interventions, what is the family or child's you in that scenario.

591
01:06:27,270 --> 01:06:30,810
Mhm. Yeah. Yeah. That's such a problem.

592
01:06:31,740 --> 01:06:38,700
Yeah. I think that's a great answer but I was like I'm pretty sure divorce rates are they.

593
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:48,780
I can't remember. I, I think for I think that is the case but I don't know that research area super well.

594
01:06:50,970 --> 01:07:02,340
And I think I mean the other of course thing that unfortunately also comes right is like addiction and PTSD and lots of things that can like,

595
01:07:02,970 --> 01:07:12,360
you know, for that for the parents, you know why this is not for dinner for the parent like kick off that stress response that just.

596
01:07:13,270 --> 01:07:18,550
Yeah. It is like impossible. Like they can not impossible back without a lot of help.

597
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:23,680
We get on and that's it. Yeah.

598
01:07:23,820 --> 01:07:35,160
Cause, I mean, especially when it was like reunion videos like.

599
01:07:35,170 --> 01:07:41,550
Well, we're not the parents, like, but. Returning to this role in your life?

600
01:07:42,370 --> 01:07:45,930
I just had a totally different moment. I mean, transition time.

601
01:07:46,290 --> 01:07:50,340
Yeah. And maybe in that transition time, I thought, you know.

602
01:10:53,210 --> 01:11:43,800
Yeah. And.
