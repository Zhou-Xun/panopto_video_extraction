1
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,060
Ten. I think we're all set.

2
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:16,270
Okay, so let's get started. So today we're going to look at a very interesting problem.

3
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,180
Thanks to all for recommendation of this problem.

4
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:28,090
So let's look at this problem and different variants of the of the problem to see how we can use what we learned,

5
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:31,270
especially the statistics to solve this problem.

6
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:37,540
So the set up is as follows Assume that we have ducks in the round pond.

7
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:43,510
And for simplicity, we just assume these stocks are randomly heading out in the in this round,

8
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:49,120
and each stock is assumed to be a point without any volume.

9
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:53,510
Okay. So they are infinitely small dogs.

10
00:00:54,230 --> 00:01:01,400
The question is, what is the probability that all the dogs are in the same half of the circle?

11
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:12,620
It's a very simple set up. Okay. But in fact, to solve this question, to to solve this probability is not so simple.

12
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:21,940
And it definitely involves some. Deep thinking about how to formulate it as a probabilistic problem.

13
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:28,680
See the question clear. We have dogs randomly hanging out in the round sound.

14
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:38,150
Okay. What's the probability that all the dogs will fall into the same half of the circle?

15
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:44,370
So let me try to draw this illustration here.

16
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:54,319
So you have this around pound and you just have a random does in this.

17
00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:00,920
LB Right. For example, we can start from the simple case where you only have two ducks.

18
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:10,020
What's the probability that the two dogs will fall into the same half of the circle?

19
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,440
You know, think of the probability of assuming that you have to.

20
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:46,350
If you only have two knocks, what's the probability? And I guess.

21
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:53,990
So there's just a randomly. Throw to that in this round pond.

22
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,750
What is the probability? One Very good.

23
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:04,950
It's a one. They always fall into the same huff because you can always find.

24
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:12,510
A line that goes through this really is. Now the two that will be on the same side of this line.

25
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:18,070
Okay. Because you can always draw the line in a way.

26
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:24,570
Let's say. This is your radius, right? This is one duck.

27
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:28,890
You can always draw a line that connects to the radius.

28
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:33,799
And this stop, no matter where the other death line. With zero probability.

29
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:40,790
The other that will lie on this line. Right. So with one probability, it will either be on this side or on the other side.

30
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:44,870
No matter which side, we will be on the same half of the circle.

31
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,600
So if you have to, that's not probability. You're going to be one.

32
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:54,000
Does that make sense? I.

33
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:59,360
Good. So now the problem becomes interesting if we have more adults.

34
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:08,330
Oh. You to have three ducks. They may not be in the same half circle.

35
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:13,320
Right. Like in this case, the three dogs. Cannot.

36
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:20,650
There is no half circle that contained all three dots. And then the question is, what's the probability?

37
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:26,120
Now this three dogs actually fall into the same half of the circle.

38
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:35,920
I'll give you a couple of minutes. Think about how you can modulate and translate this problem into a simpler setting.

39
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:42,120
Okay. And then try to come up with a probabilistic way of solving this problem.

40
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:48,360
Just to give you a hint, think about the location of the dogs. Does the.

41
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:55,340
Distance from the radius to the dark matter. Probably doesn't.

42
00:04:55,670 --> 00:05:00,450
Right. Only the angle matters. So in that case.

43
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:06,050
You can think about instead of thinking about putting the stocks in the pound,

44
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:10,250
you just need to consider the case where the ducks are all on the circle.

45
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:19,300
I only need to care about is the probability of the three random dolls in the circle actually belongs to the.

46
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:24,990
The three random dots. On the circle.

47
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:32,170
Actually falls into the same half of this article.

48
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:40,920
What's the probability of that? Right. But still, even simplifying the problem like that, it's not a very easy question.

49
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:46,810
So take a couple of minutes. Think about the setting. You can start from a three.

50
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:52,040
Once you get to any of the three, you can try to generalize this to a larger end.

51
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:56,690
Okay. So take a couple minutes. Think about this this problem.

52
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:01,530
See what they think. Got it.

53
00:06:03,810 --> 00:09:23,570
If. One.

54
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:31,770
Say that again. Uh.

55
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:38,219
I believe so. It's a very good. All right.

56
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:42,330
So let's take a look at how we can tackle this problem step by step.

57
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:51,720
First of all, as I mentioned, the very first thing that we can notice is that the distance to the center actually does not matter in this case.

58
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:59,340
Since we do now consider the volume of the duck, essentially the stock is considered as a point.

59
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:09,700
And whether they are in the same half disk of this, you know, of this Â£1 is equivalent to say whether the three dogs,

60
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:15,210
the projected point on the owl circle is in the same half circle.

61
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:24,200
Okay. So no matter where they lie in this town, we just need to draw these projection lines and projected everything into the circle.

62
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:31,880
As long as the three projected points are in the same half circle, then the three dots can be.

63
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:37,640
In the same half disk. Right.

64
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:40,880
So that's the very important first observation.

65
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:45,680
So essentially we converted the problem from calculating the probability of three dots in

66
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:52,280
the same half disk to the probability of three projected points in the same half circle.

67
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:55,760
So we changed this two dimensional problem to a one dimensional problem.

68
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:03,320
Okay. And second, we can notice that the dots are randomly placed in the round pond.

69
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:12,200
So that is equivalent to say the pawns and the productive pawns are randomly placed on this circle.

70
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:20,450
Each point is has a you can consider the circle and the support for this or this point.

71
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:25,730
Now, each point has a uniform distribution on this circle. It can be anywhere.

72
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:35,790
All right. So now the problem is, if I randomly throw three points on this circle randomly, what's the probability that the three points?

73
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:39,850
While we are on the same side of the of the circle.

74
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:44,550
Whether there exists a line that goes.

75
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:50,710
Through this really is not all the points are to one side of the circle.

76
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:55,800
Right. So that's the problem that we're trying to solve.

77
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:03,430
So, Your Honor, to solve it, we need to define some random variables so we can calculate the probability.

78
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:06,310
Okay, so let's do it in that way first.

79
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:15,550
By defining some probability, by defining some random variables, and use the order statistic to try to solve that.

80
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:24,580
So one way to define the order statistic and one way to define the random variable in this case is you can fix one of the docs.

81
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:35,190
So this may not be the best choice here. I mean. So again, let's start from the three and equal the three case.

82
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:40,330
So without loss of a generality, we can assume.

83
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:47,840
One of the dogs to be. Let's say that a and we fix it.

84
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:56,750
And all we need to worry about is the radical mobilization of the remaining two dogs with this with this dog.

85
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:02,990
Right. You can always fix one dot and look at the right of regulation of the other dogs with this dog.

86
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:07,720
So why don't we? One way we can define the random variable is to define.

87
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:15,010
The angle between this line.

88
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:21,970
That is the connection between the center and that A to that B.

89
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:25,900
So we've found that that to be our X one.

90
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:33,510
And. This is taxi. So we define this angle to be acts to.

91
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:38,610
All right. So that's one way to define the random variables.

92
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:45,750
If we define the random variables, that way we can find immediately about this x one and x two.

93
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:57,639
We are independent. Because B and C, they can be anywhere, even with fixed A, B and C can be still randomly assigned only circle.

94
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:04,480
So x1x2 are independent and they are I.D. They are identical, only distributed.

95
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:12,120
Both have a uniform distribution. Right, because again, it's a randomly put on this circle.

96
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:15,240
So we have a uniform distribution and the support.

97
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:24,490
Sex i i d i for the one or two with a uniform distribution.

98
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:33,130
What is the support for this random available? So assuming that we turn this counterclockwise as positive angles.

99
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:37,750
It's clockwise as negative angles.

100
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:47,570
What would be the support for this exercise? It will go all the way back to an pi.

101
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:55,189
To pay, right? So the dog can be anywhere in this circle.

102
00:14:55,190 --> 00:15:00,010
So if it's somewhere here, it has a. Height, an active angle.

103
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:10,810
That's the. Angle between the the dark and the dark a and the smallest I am going to be is negative pi.

104
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:17,110
And if it's on the other side of the of the pound, then the largest and going to be the pi.

105
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:22,350
So the range is from that point upon. All right.

106
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:34,020
Does that make sense? So now we we define a run, a variable that essentially determines the location of the three docks.

107
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:42,630
Then what's left is to translate this probability of interest using this newly defined run of variables.

108
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:55,450
How do we translate the probability of this event that three points in the same half circle in terms of this to run a variable that we defined.

109
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:03,330
What is that event? Equivalent to in terms of this excise.

110
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:17,230
I have this ax, one ax to ride. So think about the case where.

111
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:24,650
X one is here. The largest.

112
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:28,820
Point, the largest value to who can take.

113
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:35,510
At this much. Right.

114
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:40,970
If Acts one is fixed in this much, the maximum value Acts two can take this much.

115
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:47,460
And as to if that's true is here, then it's still within the same half circle.

116
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:56,090
But if that's true, is it beyond that point, then the three dogs it's going to be will not be in the same circle.

117
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,970
Right. So we have an upper limit for this as to.

118
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:11,310
Even next one. Similarly, if you ask one is on the positive side, then you know.

119
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:24,780
If you're one. It's here, then, you know, the upper body can be anywhere, right?

120
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:28,620
They can go all the way up to PI and it's okay.

121
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:32,530
It's okay because they are still. Still on the same side.

122
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:42,550
So that just tells us something about the constraint on this to run variables in order for the three dots to be the same side of the pound.

123
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:50,250
So that is this probability is equal to the probability of.

124
00:17:55,700 --> 00:18:01,660
The larger one of the two. Minus the smaller one of the two.

125
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:06,830
Should be. Greater say.

126
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:13,930
Should be smaller. Hi.

127
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,420
If the larger one of the two.

128
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:28,400
So here acts parenthesis two is the order statistics of this two write the largest one of this two and x one is a smaller one of the two.

129
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:35,660
If the difference between the larger one and a smaller one, the larger and going the smaller angle is a way then pi.

130
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:42,480
Think and think about how this these remaining two dogs can be placed on this circle.

131
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:50,669
They must be in the same circle. Right. The only three scenario that can happen is one.

132
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:57,060
Both stocks are on one side of that of the pound. So that the difference is going to be less than pie.

133
00:18:57,390 --> 00:19:02,700
Right. Or one that is to the lack of a one that is to the right up they gave.

134
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:08,580
Their difference is less on pie than again, they will be on the same half circle.

135
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:14,250
Right. So that is the equivalent.

136
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:22,020
Event. For the original event. The three dogs are in the same officer.

137
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:35,230
Does that make sense? So the only three scenarios, the three dots can be.

138
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:44,620
Once you fix A, B and C, you can be both on left hand side, both on the right hand side or one dark on the left.

139
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:54,130
One on the right. In each case, you can verify that if the difference between this x to an x one is less than pi,

140
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:59,530
the three dots will always be in the same observable and vice versa.

141
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:03,310
If they are in the same half circle, then the difference.

142
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:10,380
Difference must be less than pi. So we're kind of equivalent expression of the original event.

143
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:20,820
And now the problem becomes what is the probability of this guy, this pi and this x two minus x one less than pi.

144
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:27,510
And that we know how to calculate. Right. We just learned in class.

145
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:33,470
So as to is the match statistics. That's one of the mean statistic.

146
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:40,290
The difference is what do we call the French? In particular, in this case, it's a uniform distribution.

147
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:45,600
We directly derived the distribution for the range.

148
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:49,850
What? Uniform distribution? All right.

149
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:55,110
So we can ride on the ranch. Wear uniform recall.

150
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:05,850
fz12. The hand the our I.D. uniform.

151
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:10,450
On zero one. We know.

152
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:16,060
Does he want the end of a joint distribution?

153
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:20,810
Of. I mean the formula.

154
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:40,190
Somebody has drawn distribution of. Well.

155
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,020
For annotation, simplicity. Let's not confuse.

156
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:52,590
So here we have three dogs. Then we have to run a variables.

157
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:56,330
If we have dogs, we have M minus one and running variables.

158
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:00,169
We only have to define these angles for the remaining M minus one.

159
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:04,850
That's. So we have a random sample size and minus one.

160
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:10,330
I have a random sample size and mine is one that is.

161
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:23,410
And minus one. And minus two times V minus U to the power of a minus three.

162
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:29,950
With the support you the zero to be two one.

163
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:37,920
So that's the joint distribution. For the order statistics and of of uniform distribution on zero one.

164
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:41,920
With a minus one sample size. Okay.

165
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:46,460
And we also have. The ranch.

166
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:55,590
Following a payroll distribution which has a PDF.

167
00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:09,260
How? This is what we deriving clause in the.

168
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:15,970
In the examples in our slides right now, you can think about how to derive this.

169
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:21,180
Join PDF file the statistics as well as the range.

170
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:26,760
And now we can use this result to help us solve this probability.

171
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:33,910
In this case, we want to solve the probability of the orange last line high.

172
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:41,030
But the difference is, instead of having this uniform from 0 to 1, we have a uniform from an active pie to a pie.

173
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:48,110
So first of all, we need to establish the relation between this is two different types of uniform distribution.

174
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:58,460
So I originally x1x to the r i the uniform, not to pi to pi.

175
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:05,330
So the way to transform it is to have z one equal to x, one plus pi.

176
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:12,230
Over to Pine Oak and the two people to house two lost pie.

177
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:21,229
Over to PI. Once you do this linear transformation, you won't say that they become ivy.

178
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:24,630
The. Uniform from 0 to 1.

179
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:31,460
Right. Original Act one, Acts two, they are uniform from an active fighter pilot.

180
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:35,420
Once you do this linear transformation, you've got a uniform from 0 to 1.

181
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:48,740
So you can use this result. So now with this preparation we can calculate what's the probability of x two minus x one smaller than pi?

182
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:59,450
That is just equal to. The one, the two minus the one.

183
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:03,510
Last line. One half. Okay.

184
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:07,210
We can work out this inverse transformation.

185
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:11,490
This is equivalent to x one equal to two pi.

186
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:16,030
One minus pi. Two equal to two pi.

187
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:24,040
The two minus pi. So you plug it in. The difference of the x is equal to the last time.

188
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:28,060
Pi is the equivalent to say the difference of the Z less than one half.

189
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:35,300
And that is the probability of this rent less than one half.

190
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:39,860
With our sample size and to be three. Okay.

191
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:47,290
Which is the integration of 0 to 1 half.

192
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:52,740
Three minus one. Three. Minus two.

193
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:58,080
Ah. To the three minus. Three.

194
00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:03,240
One minus r. The r. Okay.

195
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:08,530
And can solve this. This goes away.

196
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:13,270
It goes away. This becomes, too. So the integration is way.

197
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:26,770
No, it's. Two are miners are square.

198
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:31,490
Right. Zero.

199
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:39,710
So that is. Three mice.

200
00:26:40,020 --> 00:27:02,710
Three or four. Is that right? Okay.

201
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:12,040
So that's four and equal to three. So we have three or four of a probability the three dogs fall into the same.

202
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,010
Half circle.

203
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:27,860
So you can say essentially we can first of all, define the run of our life interest and then translate this our original problem using the statistics.

204
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:33,930
The key here. Is to translate this.

205
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:42,820
To this. The translate how the three ducks are in the same half circle.

206
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:48,450
What is the equivalent expression of that in terms of these angles?

207
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:56,639
So in this case, the equivalent expression of that is the to the difference of the largest angle.

208
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:01,680
And the smallest angle is the last one. PI is less than 180 degrees.

209
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:08,840
I know they think that the race is just a. Calculation.

210
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:19,740
The rest of you can just use the existing results for uniform distribution.

211
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:24,950
With a minor trick. You have to do some linear transformation in order to directly use it.

212
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:30,670
But. It's essentially just a use that will not solve this problem.

213
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:36,410
You get to the final result about three or four. So that's part three.

214
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:44,120
What about if you have. So I give you a couple of minutes.

215
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:54,350
You can work out the. Generic formula for the probability of having dogs falling to the same half circle.

216
00:31:37,310 --> 00:33:22,900
So show me your hand if you get the final solution. You got it.

217
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:29,490
What is the formula? Bears and ducks.

218
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:33,610
What's the probability of all the dots are the same half circle.

219
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:43,410
Anyone. Yes.

220
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:53,260
Very good. And over to to the power up and minus one.

221
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:57,770
And the matter is exactly the same. All right.

222
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:02,880
If you have any ducks, then you can define a minus one run of variables.

223
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:11,500
Again. You fix one dog and they find a random variable based on the angle of that dog and all every other dog.

224
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:19,340
Okay. You have minus one random variables uniformly distributed on this negative pi to pi.

225
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:26,210
And again, the equivalent probability of all the galaxy in the same half circle is the max statistics.

226
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:32,850
Minus the mean statistic less than point. Question.

227
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:40,490
Maybe it can be. Sure. Yeah.

228
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:44,150
Yeah. Well, we'll go to the. Well, we'll talk about that in a second.

229
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:58,720
Yeah. So. Then we have the range statistics for uniform below this one half right out of this and minus one samples.

230
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:08,320
So you plug in the same formula, solve that integration, and it will grab this final result and over to the power of a minus one.

231
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:13,470
Okay. So an equal to three if you have three dots. Think about three or four.

232
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:18,270
Four dots for over two. Two of the three. Four over eight.

233
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:26,190
One half. And so on. So forth. So that's one way to solve this question.

234
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:32,950
Okay. And as you mentioned, there are different ways to solve this problem.

235
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:39,710
So what is your solution to this? Something the company will be.

236
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:45,640
And others across the. Mm hmm. Do you have any?

237
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:53,170
And then two diametrically opposite. Right.

238
00:35:53,410 --> 00:36:01,450
When you count the number of people who are using. Very good to see that they're on the same page.

239
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:11,900
Mm hmm. Mm hmm. You can go out and. Marilyn.

240
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:17,300
That's the next thing that I want to talk about, which is the alternative approach.

241
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:29,500
Probabilistic solution to this problem. So, again, as was honey, I did.

242
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:33,220
Okay. So as. I did just I mentioned.

243
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:43,430
Another way to think about this problem is if you have an dogs on this circle, right, you can always order them in some way.

244
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:49,330
You can always honor this. So these are the dogs, right?

245
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:58,370
So I may I may present the solution slightly different from yours, my general idea and the same.

246
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:08,450
So there are always ordering. So you can say you can order the dock based on this counterclockwise ordering and always find one done.

247
00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:13,690
That is the head of this. And that's.

248
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:24,100
One way to define which one is the hat is you pick the one that has the largest distance from the one ahead of it by a hat of it,

249
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:28,010
I mean, to the to the clockwise direction.

250
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:31,790
For example, if I look at this.

251
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:41,330
One, two, three, four, five, six dots, then this one is the hat because it has the largest distance from the one in front of it.

252
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:47,810
You can always find with probability one, you can always find a unique tag.

253
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:53,260
That is the hat. No matter how this and dogs are distributed on the circle.

254
00:37:53,740 --> 00:38:01,730
And once you find this hard. The honor for all the dots to be the same half circle.

255
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:11,890
Basically what you need is all the remaining docs to be on the right hand side or to the behind this doc.

256
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:20,810
Okay. And cannot go beyond the opposite point when you actually start with the center.

257
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:29,000
If all the dots are in this circle, then, you know, all the dogs are in the same half circle.

258
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:38,930
If anyone is going beyond this half circle, then you know they won't be in the same circle, become this one that had right by being the heart.

259
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:43,550
And basically it has the largest distance from the one in front of it.

260
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:52,930
So now we can really think about the probability that we care about the probability of all dogs.

261
00:38:55,500 --> 00:39:01,010
In the same. Half circle.

262
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:13,180
Now becomes the probability of picking one dog at the head and having all the remaining dogs to be behind this dog,

263
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:18,100
but only to be within the same half circle. Okay.

264
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:25,850
So if we. Call them Doc A, B, C, D, and so on and so forth.

265
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:38,710
Then the probability of orthodoxy in the same circle is the probability of a being the head, and all the doubts are within the same circle,

266
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:47,820
plus the probability of B being the head and all adults are in the same half circle and so on, so forth.

267
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:53,320
Until the last probability of, let's say, the Z that.

268
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:57,880
The hat and all the women are in the same half circle.

269
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:04,030
So now all these probability, they are equal probabilities because all they start they are exchangeable.

270
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:15,220
Right. And the probability of all the remaining parts in the sixth in the same half circle is just two to the power of n minus one one over that.

271
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:23,730
Because each women and that has half of the probability been on one side, half of the probability of being on the other side.

272
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:32,870
So the probability of all the acts behind this head that is just one half to the power of minus one.

273
00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:37,100
And you have. I know it.

274
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:47,330
Okay. So that gave you the final result of an over two to go power up and minus one.

275
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:51,750
So the same probability. Okay.

276
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:55,760
So here the key is to. Again.

277
00:40:55,910 --> 00:41:08,750
Riggs, press this event. In the equivalent event, a basic level event is collaborative PDA designed so that we have an equal probability events.

278
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:16,510
Each event. The probability of each event is relatively straightforward to calculate.

279
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:22,300
Okay. Does this make sense?

280
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:29,240
So this is another way to calculate this probability from this alternative approach.

281
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:39,180
Okay. Any question about this, uh, alternative approach.

282
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:50,300
Or to put it another way, we define a dog to be to have a dog if and only if.

283
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:55,760
First of all, that dog has a long the longest distance from the one that before him.

284
00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:01,430
Second, all the dogs has to be behind him and are within this half circle.

285
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:06,130
Only notice we had that. If that's the case,

286
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:16,630
then all that same the same half circle is equivalent to the event of a being the haddock or baby in haddock or saving the haddock or so and so forth.

287
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:20,910
And you can calculate the probability of each stock being had that.

288
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:26,550
Is essentially the probability is a one over two to the power of a minus one.

289
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:33,540
Okay. Or it could be the haddock. All the other ducks has to be behind him and or within the half circle.

290
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:39,520
So that's one half to the power of this one. All right.

291
00:42:42,210 --> 00:42:52,170
Any questions about this alternative approach? So we have two different approaches to solve this, the same problem.

292
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:55,710
One is using the random variables and statistics.

293
00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:00,250
The other one is using this probability. Probability, uh.

294
00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:07,310
Idea. And you can think about extensions of this problem.

295
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:14,900
And he will say that in these different solutions, different ideas, different solutions to the to the same problem.

296
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:22,090
This can be useful in different scenarios. Sometimes this probabilistic solution may be easier to use.

297
00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:26,140
Sometimes this idea could be easier.

298
00:43:27,350 --> 00:43:34,730
For example, think about modifying this problem to be what's the probability of and that's.

299
00:43:35,890 --> 00:43:41,480
Falling to the same quarter circle. Okay.

300
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:53,230
Again, we can project all the dots to these outside circle.

301
00:43:53,410 --> 00:43:56,770
Right. What's the probability of all this? All this starts.

302
00:43:57,770 --> 00:44:06,140
One in the same quarter circle. Again, you can proceed both ways.

303
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:12,890
But I will say that probably it's easier to go with the probabilistic solution.

304
00:44:15,130 --> 00:44:20,100
So being the same quarter circle. What does that mean?

305
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:28,590
So you can pick anyone to be the hat again using this counterclockwise as the direction of ordering.

306
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:34,920
You can pick anyone to be the head up and to be the hat that it has to satisfy the condition that,

307
00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:39,090
first of all, is the furthest away from the other dogs.

308
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:47,620
Okay. Second, every other dog's is behind this dog and within this quarter circle.

309
00:44:49,390 --> 00:44:53,700
Then the probability. I'll be in this.

310
00:44:55,290 --> 00:45:04,440
Quarter circle going to be the probability of a being the haddock or B being the haddock or so on and so forth.

311
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:08,160
Where is probability is what?

312
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:20,620
What's the probability of a given that being the hat? Following the same logic was the probability of a given, that being the head.

313
00:45:21,610 --> 00:45:26,140
In order for it to be the had all the other dogs has to be within this.

314
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:34,470
Quarter circle. So what's the probability of each stock being in a quarter sample?

315
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:51,170
One to report, right? Because he still can be anywhere in this circle.

316
00:45:51,390 --> 00:45:57,590
So the probability of the dark being in this particular quantum circle is just one one over four.

317
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:04,640
And all the minus one docs has to be that quarter circle in order for a to be the haddock.

318
00:46:05,810 --> 00:46:09,620
Okay, so that gave you one over four, two and minus one.

319
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:15,830
Similarly for another haddock. One, two, four, four, two, one, minus one, and so on and so forth.

320
00:46:16,310 --> 00:46:22,700
So finally, the probability is just an over four to the power of a minus one.

321
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:34,190
So using this probabilistic idea, you can relatively easily extend the previous formula to this.

322
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:43,640
Quarter circle problem. But the running Marvel idea.

323
00:46:45,730 --> 00:46:49,420
Could be slightly more complicated in this case.

324
00:46:50,730 --> 00:46:53,730
Think about how we define the random variables.

325
00:46:53,730 --> 00:47:02,700
Right? We fix one that. Here and consider the angle between Nasdaq and every other DAX.

326
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:09,780
This is your one. This is your ex to take.

327
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:18,510
So previously we have the nice equivalents of the range.

328
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:26,800
Below Pi. And now for all this, all the ducks to be in the same quarter circle.

329
00:47:28,130 --> 00:47:32,900
It's not enough to just to restrict the range of these random variables.

330
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:41,870
Because you kind of have all the ducks, all the remaining ducks tightly packed over here where the range is very small.

331
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:52,530
But recall that we have our first line far from those stocks, so they are still not in the same quarter circle.

332
00:47:54,660 --> 00:48:06,420
So the probability of they being the same quarter circle is not equal to the probability of the wrench or my notation.

333
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:14,630
This X and minus one. Minus X one less than.

334
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:20,630
Pi over two is not. Okay.

335
00:48:22,470 --> 00:48:29,260
Because this is the rents in this case. These are the angles, right?

336
00:48:29,530 --> 00:48:39,040
So the rent is just the this angle. The rents does not take into account the fact that we have additional dog that we have already fixed.

337
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:47,310
So this probability is actually equal to the probability of, first of all, x one.

338
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:53,030
The minimum angle. Is.

339
00:48:55,780 --> 00:49:00,100
Greater than negative pi over two, right?

340
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:06,970
If the negative angle is beyond this much, then we cannot be in the same quarter circle.

341
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:12,130
So this one, the smallest angle, has to be greater.

342
00:49:13,330 --> 00:49:19,660
Then pi over two and similarly the largest angle has to be last, then pi over two.

343
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:26,820
And the difference. Has to be.

344
00:49:27,990 --> 00:49:29,190
Less than five over two.

345
00:49:29,910 --> 00:49:39,570
So these three events, the intersection of these three events, really defines the probability of all the dogs in this quarter circle.

346
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:46,360
And that's a much more. Complicated problem to solve.

347
00:49:46,990 --> 00:49:50,920
You can do the integration, but the integration limit is slightly more complicated.

348
00:49:51,190 --> 00:49:56,770
It's not a very regular area as it is defined by the three foundations.

349
00:49:58,990 --> 00:50:03,760
All right. So in this case, tackling the probabilistic approach is much easier.

350
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:07,960
To give you the final solution, we got the same solution using both.

351
00:50:08,230 --> 00:50:11,740
But just to be careful that for the random variable solution.

352
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:21,480
You need to consider this. Additional two events are to carry equivalent events of the task falling to the same quarter circle.

353
00:50:27,130 --> 00:50:32,560
So that's one extension. Alternatively, think about another extension where.

354
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:43,860
Things flipped. The probabilistic approach becomes complicated by the random variable approach become simpler.

355
00:50:44,070 --> 00:50:52,320
That is, if you consider all of that, fall into this three or four circle, this three quarters circle.

356
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:58,530
What's the probability? See my case.

357
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:07,170
The probability approach is tricky because now the dogs can lie.

358
00:51:08,330 --> 00:51:15,110
Everywhere. Right. So as long as they lie in this fashion, it's okay to.

359
00:51:15,950 --> 00:51:20,330
Because they are still in this. Three quarters of a circle.

360
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:25,250
But there is no easy way to define. What is the haddock.

361
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:34,830
Because if you think about that, they making more extreme if you think about this line up for the six ducks.

362
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:46,460
Actually this dog can be considered as the haddock or this dog can be considered the harder because both are.

363
00:51:47,730 --> 00:52:03,300
Ah, not this one. Or this one can be considered the haddock because this one actually has the largest distance from the one that in front of it.

364
00:52:04,170 --> 00:52:10,260
So we actually double count a lot of scenarios in this case if you do that using this probability approach.

365
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:15,060
All right. So, in other words, the probability of.

366
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:26,000
Of all the dogs fall into this,

367
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:37,010
three quarters of a circle is not equivalent to the simple summation of a dog or baby in the out and so on and so forth.

368
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:45,020
Okay. Because in this case, in this particular line up, both this adult and I say this is the see that,

369
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:50,240
for example, both a dog can see that can be considered out of the dog.

370
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:59,010
All right. So you can get to three quarters of circle this way or you can get to three quarters of a circle.

371
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:11,730
In this way. So both. We gave you all the ducks in the three quarters of the circle.

372
00:53:12,730 --> 00:53:18,650
So I assure you, you can't do this scenario twice if you do it by summing up this probabilities.

373
00:53:19,670 --> 00:53:27,680
So the way that we calculated the probability in the previous way will give you a wrong answer because over time, in many scenarios.

374
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:33,260
So the formula that I can in this in this fashion will not be correct.

375
00:53:34,230 --> 00:53:44,980
However, if you think about how we define the random variables, you can still define one box to be the fixed one and to consider all these additional.

376
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:53,660
That's right. And consider there. Angles and the idea of using this.

377
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:07,310
The range of A minus one, minus X one last line.

378
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:15,910
So in this case. Three quarters of a two pie still makes sense.

379
00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:21,490
As long as the ranch is less than three quarters of the two pie,

380
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:28,000
then this is equivalent to say all the dogs are eating in three quarters of the circle.

381
00:54:29,730 --> 00:54:32,010
So in fact, this is much easier to calculate.

382
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:41,530
You can still use the range statistic, the distribution of the rental statistics to gather your formula for this probability.

383
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:53,030
So it's a very interesting problem, depending on what is this angle that I care about, what is the angle that you define for the ducks?

384
00:54:53,690 --> 00:54:57,410
One matter could be easier than the other one. If it's less than.

385
00:54:58,650 --> 00:55:04,530
180 degrees. Then using the probabilistic, probabilistic approach would be easier.

386
00:55:05,570 --> 00:55:11,690
If is greater than one or 80 degrees, then using this random random variable idea would be much easier.

387
00:55:12,970 --> 00:55:20,320
It all boils down to what is the equivalent event? Whether we can easily calculate the probability of an equivalent event.

388
00:55:22,330 --> 00:55:25,560
All right. At exactly. At one hour, 80 degrees.

389
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:29,430
Both can be easily soft and give you the same solution.

390
00:55:31,970 --> 00:55:39,970
All right. Any questions? So I didn't work out all these solutions.

391
00:55:39,970 --> 00:55:45,330
But I hope you got a rough idea of these two different approaches to solve this problem.

392
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:49,540
It's a. If this is the first time that I see this problem.

393
00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:52,740
Definitely a very interesting but mind boggling problem.

394
00:55:52,810 --> 00:55:59,380
So take some time to think about this study. Very straightforward setting, but a very interesting probabilistic problem.

395
00:55:59,970 --> 00:56:06,470
Okay. So if you have any questions, feel free to send me an email and have I do discussing in more details.

396
00:56:07,130 --> 00:56:11,590
But that's it for today. And thank you for your attention.

397
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:45,100
Yeah. That's been a point about like these two different approaches.

398
00:57:45,270 --> 00:57:50,530
I think like. Jane. Generally two approaches.

399
00:57:54,520 --> 00:58:02,110
Um, yeah, that's a very typical case where you can have this different ways of solving the same problem,

400
00:58:02,110 --> 00:58:09,400
and typically you can find a very clever way of solving it using this probability, uh, by, you know.

401
00:58:10,550 --> 00:58:20,980
Tactically designed as a. Probability calculation, you can solve it, you know, very easily and then more quickly.

402
00:58:20,990 --> 00:58:26,980
But I would say with a random variety finding, the random are always the more traditional way of doing it.

403
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:30,669
So think about how to translate this problem setting out.

404
00:58:30,670 --> 00:58:33,750
There are, you know, random marbles and then.

405
00:58:35,380 --> 00:58:40,270
Calculating the original probability of solving a integration problem that's more standard.

406
00:58:41,110 --> 00:58:48,309
So you can always solve the problem that way. But the clarity, the more clever, probabilistic approach sometimes works.

407
00:58:48,310 --> 00:58:51,670
Sometimes it does not. So there is a risk in it.

408
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:59,690
And like me in this example, to define these events requires nothing more technical.

409
00:58:59,990 --> 00:59:05,420
Exactly. Exactly. If you can see the, you know, equivalent events.

410
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:10,800
Which has a straightforward probability, then you solve it right away.

411
00:59:11,070 --> 00:59:23,800
Right. But that's how this tricky. Using defining property defined around the memorable and expressed by that events is in terms of the variable and.

412
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:31,480
That is a more traditional way of doing it because, you know, the for distribution of the Bible,

413
00:59:31,850 --> 00:59:37,730
you can always calculate the probability based on the ground available by solving this immigration.

414
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:43,580
Right. So that is that, you know, you never go wrong on a third.

415
00:59:44,910 --> 00:59:45,310
Thank again.
