1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:05,968
Hi everyone, today we're going to talk about alleles genotypes and

2
00:00:05,968 --> 00:00:11,342
haplotypes, learning objectives are to define alleles, genotypes,

3
00:00:11,342 --> 00:00:15,770
haplotypes and single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs.

4
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:20,035
And also to explain the way that mutation histories lead to

5
00:00:20,035 --> 00:00:22,392
haplotypes in the population.

6
00:00:22,392 --> 00:00:27,610
Mutations at the population level can be thought of in different ways.

7
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:33,481
So, alleles, genotypes and haplotypes are really the versions of DNA,

8
00:00:33,481 --> 00:00:39,558
at a particular spot in the genome that a chromosome has or that a person has.

9
00:00:39,558 --> 00:00:43,866
Allele, genotype and haplotype frequencies are describing

10
00:00:43,866 --> 00:00:49,000
the population level distributions of these different versions of DNA,

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,746
so how common are they in a population?

12
00:00:51,746 --> 00:00:56,453
In Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium and Linkage disequilibrium are talking

13
00:00:56,453 --> 00:01:00,083
about how frequencies are organized within a population.

14
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:05,334
So is particularly spread across an entire population evenly or are there

15
00:01:05,334 --> 00:01:10,771
pockets of people that tend to have it more than other people, for example.

16
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:17,903
So we really have to start with defining some of this basic nomenclature for

17
00:01:17,903 --> 00:01:18,610
genetics.

18
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:22,898
So the allele, is the type of genetic variation that's at

19
00:01:22,898 --> 00:01:25,890
a particular location on a chromosome.

20
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:30,506
So a lot of times, introductory genetics or things like that.

21
00:01:30,506 --> 00:01:35,443
[COUGH] We'll talk about the fictional form like the big A allele and

22
00:01:35,443 --> 00:01:40,380
the little a allele, what that is really referring to is something

23
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,580
in the DNA sequence at the base pair level.

24
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:48,581
For example, you could have a T allele at base pair 71

25
00:01:48,581 --> 00:01:53,474
mega bases, that's the location on chromosome 2 or

26
00:01:53,474 --> 00:01:58,058
at that same location, you could have a C allele.

27
00:01:58,058 --> 00:02:02,831
In terms of how it affects the protein, if we're talking about

28
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:08,154
a coding region of a gene we can talk about the allele in the codon form.

29
00:02:08,154 --> 00:02:12,323
So at the 124th codon in a particular protein

30
00:02:12,323 --> 00:02:16,293
you can have either an arginine or a glycine.

31
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:23,967
Here's an illustration of how the allele works, so here we're looking at

32
00:02:23,967 --> 00:02:28,910
the chromosome inherited from the mother and this is just one strand of DNA.

33
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:32,992
So let's assume that it's a DNA coding sequence and

34
00:02:32,992 --> 00:02:35,789
this is the sense strand of the DNA.

35
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:41,236
Starting from five prime to three prime, remember that there's gonna be an anti

36
00:02:41,236 --> 00:02:46,621
sense strand down here A will pair with T, T will pair with A,G will pair with C.

37
00:02:46,621 --> 00:02:48,651
But we're not showing that strand right now.

38
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,885
[COUGH] To assume that this is a DNA coding sequence,

39
00:02:53,885 --> 00:02:57,552
this is the first position in the first axon and

40
00:02:57,552 --> 00:03:02,836
here in yellow is the eighth position in that same axon of the gene.

41
00:03:02,836 --> 00:03:06,923
And let's say that this person on the chromosome they inherited

42
00:03:06,923 --> 00:03:11,386
from their mother has a T allele at position eight on the sent strand and

43
00:03:11,386 --> 00:03:13,974
from their father they have an A allele.

44
00:03:13,974 --> 00:03:18,340
This means that there's genetic variation in the population where

45
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:23,030
a chromosome can either have a T there or it can have an A at that position.

46
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:27,590
So at the DNA level the nomenclature is done like this.

47
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:31,909
The common allele in the population, followed by the DNA position,

48
00:03:31,909 --> 00:03:34,810
followed by the less common allele.

49
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:38,446
So here we would call this polymorphism, T8A and

50
00:03:38,446 --> 00:03:44,050
a polymorphism just means something that varies in the population.

51
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:48,785
So this is called T8A, where you can have either a T or

52
00:03:48,785 --> 00:03:51,741
an A at position eight in the DNA.

53
00:03:51,741 --> 00:03:58,070
If we're talking about it at the codon level here's the chromosome from the mom,

54
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:02,579
here's codon 180G, which codes from a thiamine CCA.

55
00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:05,064
Which codes for prowling.

56
00:04:05,064 --> 00:04:10,429
And then GTC, at this codon three is coding for veiling and

57
00:04:10,429 --> 00:04:16,014
the one from the father this GAC codon is missense mutation,

58
00:04:16,014 --> 00:04:22,019
because it changes the amino acid of the of the protein.

59
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:27,540
Here the protein sequence will be a methionine, proline, asparagine.

60
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:33,300
So at the protein level we can talk about the common amino acid variation

61
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:38,580
which is the veiling, the codon position which is codon three and

62
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:42,341
the amino acid variation that is less common.

63
00:04:42,341 --> 00:04:45,948
So here it's disparaging, so

64
00:04:45,948 --> 00:04:52,192
we would call this particular allele the Val allele or

65
00:04:52,192 --> 00:04:59,005
the asparagine allele and we call the mutation Val3Asp.

66
00:04:59,005 --> 00:05:03,990
The genotype refers to the two allele combination.

67
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:11,890
So remember the allele is referring to the particular version of the DNA or protein.

68
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:16,860
And here the genotype is the total of the two different

69
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:21,731
chromosomes that are inherited from both parents.

70
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:27,314
So let's say that at some chromosome we can have D allele or

71
00:05:27,314 --> 00:05:29,710
we can have ad allele.

72
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:34,489
The mother has inherited D from one of her parents and d from the other,

73
00:05:34,489 --> 00:05:36,120
those are the alleles.

74
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,662
Her genotype is Dd,

75
00:05:37,662 --> 00:05:43,410
because the genotype talks about the two little combination that she has.

76
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:46,900
The father's genotype here is also Dd.

77
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:52,164
So let's follow these chromosomes through the generations to see

78
00:05:52,164 --> 00:05:58,240
what kind of children a mother and a father with Dd genotypes could have.

79
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:04,567
So if mom and dad both contribute D allele to the next generation,

80
00:06:04,567 --> 00:06:09,760
this child got D allele from mom and D allele from dad.

81
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:14,099
So her genotype is DD and we call that homozygous

82
00:06:14,099 --> 00:06:19,099
because the two alleles are the same,homozygous DD.

83
00:06:19,099 --> 00:06:22,537
. If there's a child who inherited d from

84
00:06:22,537 --> 00:06:26,160
both parents ,their homozygous dd.

85
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,967
And the children who inherited D allele from one parent and

86
00:06:29,967 --> 00:06:33,241
d allele from the other are called heterozygous.

87
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,680
These are their genotypes.

88
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,698
Another thing that we need to talk about is SNPs or

89
00:06:41,698 --> 00:06:44,750
single nucleotide polymorphisms.

90
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:50,612
So remember I said a polymorphism is any mutation and specifically we talk about

91
00:06:50,612 --> 00:06:57,300
polymorphism that's present at a frequency of greater than 1% in a population.

92
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:02,159
A single nucleotide polymorphism is an allele difference

93
00:07:02,159 --> 00:07:06,231
that can either be one allele or another allele.

94
00:07:06,231 --> 00:07:13,270
The alleles just differ by a single base like we saw in the last example.

95
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:18,208
So a single nucleotide polymorphism is any single nucleotide mutation

96
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:22,661
that occurs at a frequency of greater than 1% in a population.

97
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:28,400
So here let's imagine that we have the coding strand of a gene.

98
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,199
Here's the beginning of the gene and

99
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:36,000
the DNA sequence that shared by most people in the population.

100
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,174
But here at this amino I'm sorry at this DNA position,

101
00:07:40,174 --> 00:07:45,344
the chromosome that you have could either have a G base or an A base and

102
00:07:45,344 --> 00:07:51,541
both of these are present at more than 1% of the chromosomes in the population.

103
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:57,320
We call this site a single nucleotide polymorphism.

104
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:00,144
And you can have there either the G allele or

105
00:08:00,144 --> 00:08:05,248
the A allele later on in the gene is another single nucleotide polymorphism or

106
00:08:05,248 --> 00:08:09,830
another SNP and you can have their either the C allele or the T allele.

107
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:12,850
And finally later in the gene is another snip and

108
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:16,635
at that snip you can have either the A allele or the C allele.

109
00:08:16,635 --> 00:08:19,623
So three SNPs are present in this gene.

110
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:26,315
When we talk about SNPs I just wanna remind you that they're defined by

111
00:08:26,315 --> 00:08:28,300
the alleles on one DNA strand.

112
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:34,000
So at the beginning of the gene, let's say on the positive strand or let's even

113
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,631
call it the coding strand shown in red below, so we've got this strand of DNA.

114
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:46,560
Here's the SNP and the person can either have a C on the red strand of DNA,

115
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,115
which is pairing with a G on the green strand or

116
00:08:50,115 --> 00:08:53,510
they can have a T which is pairing with an A.

117
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:56,249
So we kinda of shorthand this and

118
00:08:56,249 --> 00:09:00,930
only talk about the DNA base on the strand of interest.

119
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:06,030
So we would say this chromosome has the C allele at this SNP and

120
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:10,000
this chromosome has the T allele at this SNP.

121
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,290
But just remember that the DNA is double stranded, so on the actual chromosome

122
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:19,951
the T allele here is pairing with the A allele on the other DNA strand.

123
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:26,825
A haplotype is a combination of alleles that an individual has at

124
00:09:26,825 --> 00:09:29,360
multiple sites along a chromosome.

125
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,772
So remember we talked about three different SNPs in this gene.

126
00:09:33,772 --> 00:09:38,305
If a person has an A allele I'm sorry, if a chromosome has

127
00:09:38,305 --> 00:09:42,931
an A allele at the first SNP, a C allele at the second SNP and

128
00:09:42,931 --> 00:09:48,518
an A allele at the third SNP we call this chromosome the ACA haplotype.

129
00:09:48,518 --> 00:09:53,651
If we have a different chromosome that has a G at the first SNP,

130
00:09:53,651 --> 00:09:59,499
T at the second SNP and C at the third SNP we call that the GTC haplotype.

131
00:09:59,499 --> 00:10:03,125
Since the gene that we're talking about has three SNPs and

132
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:08,009
there are two different alleles possible for each of those SNPs that means that

133
00:10:08,009 --> 00:10:12,748
eight different haplotype could theoretically occur in this population.

134
00:10:12,748 --> 00:10:14,466
And they're listed out here.

135
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:22,905
So just to recap we'll talk about the relationship between SNPs, alleles,

136
00:10:22,905 --> 00:10:24,720
genotypes and haplotypes.

137
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,821
So here's the hypothetical gene, the start of the gene, here's a SNP

138
00:10:29,821 --> 00:10:36,050
at some position say 75, here's a SNP at 353, here's a SNP at position 756.

139
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:39,233
You can have A or G allele at this SNP, C or

140
00:10:39,233 --> 00:10:42,440
T allele at that snip ,A or C at this SNP.

141
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:48,007
Right, so in the SNP nomenclature at position 75 if G is more common than A,

142
00:10:48,007 --> 00:10:50,720
the SNP is called G75A.

143
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,959
The possible alleles are G at position 75 and

144
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:58,991
A at position 75, these are the alleles.

145
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,766
Then in an individual they're going to inherit one chromosome from their mom and

146
00:11:05,766 --> 00:11:07,880
one chromosome from their dad.

147
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:13,764
So let's say that this is the chromosome they inherited from their mom,

148
00:11:13,764 --> 00:11:15,610
the haplotype is GTA.

149
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:20,781
And the haplotype that they inherited from their dad at these three SNPs is ATC.

150
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:24,904
What is the genotype for this person for

151
00:11:24,904 --> 00:11:29,390
the first SNP ,they have an A allele and they have a G allele.

152
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:32,474
So they're an AG heterozygote.

153
00:11:32,474 --> 00:11:36,730
At the second SNP, they have two T alleles, so

154
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:40,680
they're called a TT homozygote, right?

155
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:46,016
And then at the population level these are the possible genotypes for

156
00:11:46,016 --> 00:11:50,711
each of the SNPs ,at position 75 you can have GG,AG or AA.

157
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:56,131
At position 353 you can have CC, CT or TT etc.

158
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:02,220
And then here's what I said before about the haplotypes.

159
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:06,677
This chromosome is GTA, this chromosome is ATC and so

160
00:12:06,677 --> 00:12:11,541
there are eight possible haplotypes in this population.

161
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:19,588
Okay, so if we're thinking about these eight different possible haplotypes

162
00:12:19,588 --> 00:12:24,160
that could occur in a population, what do we actually see in practice?

163
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,660
Well, in practice, we might only see a subset of them.

164
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:34,578
So even though eight could possibly exist because you have two alleles at

165
00:12:34,578 --> 00:12:40,800
three SNPs each a lot of times we don't observe that level of diversity.

166
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:46,940
So we might only see for example, ACC, ATA, ATC and GTC.

167
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:50,605
These other haplotypes might not be observed on any chromosomes in

168
00:12:50,605 --> 00:12:51,523
the population.

169
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,198
The particular haplotypes that exist in the population depend on its

170
00:12:56,198 --> 00:12:57,711
mutational history.

171
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:01,011
So let's take an example,

172
00:13:01,011 --> 00:13:06,612
let's start at the top where there's an ancestral haplotype called ATC.

173
00:13:06,612 --> 00:13:10,631
These are not SNPs right now this is just the DNA strand.

174
00:13:10,631 --> 00:13:16,020
So at this position, position 75 everyone in the population has an A.

175
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:19,890
And at position 353 everyone in the population has a T.

176
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:24,690
So these are just, people are the same at these DNA

177
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:29,670
locations throughout the entire population.

178
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:32,250
Now let's say there's a mutation.

179
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:35,672
So the A is mutated into a G and

180
00:13:35,672 --> 00:13:41,389
it's on this background of the ATC haplotype.

181
00:13:41,389 --> 00:13:45,744
So you've got chromosomes with ATC, ATC, ATC and

182
00:13:45,744 --> 00:13:51,540
now you've got one chromosome that is a GTC, at these three steps.

183
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:57,173
So it's step one, this person has a chromosome that has a G allele.

184
00:13:57,173 --> 00:14:04,140
Then let's say there's a new mutation the C mutation at this second soon to be SNP.

185
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:10,142
And it happens on a background where they have an A allele at SNP one and

186
00:14:10,142 --> 00:14:12,221
a C allele at SNP three.

187
00:14:12,221 --> 00:14:17,391
Now you've got ATC haplotypes in the population, you've got GTC

188
00:14:17,391 --> 00:14:22,295
haplotypes in the population and now you have ACC haplotypes.

189
00:14:22,295 --> 00:14:29,410
Let's say there's a third mutation and it happens on the background of ATC.

190
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:33,917
So now at the third SNP you have an A Instead of a C, if you look across this

191
00:14:33,917 --> 00:14:38,278
population you see there are four haplotypes that are observed, but

192
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:40,190
there are four that aren't.

193
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:45,448
That's because of this particular mutational history.

194
00:14:45,448 --> 00:14:47,761
If you go to a different population,

195
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:52,260
let's just say maybe they started with the same ancestral haplotype.

196
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:57,969
But then they got a G mutation at this first SNP again on the ATC background

197
00:14:57,969 --> 00:15:03,800
then they gotta C mutation but it was actually on a different background.

198
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:08,415
So the C mutation this time occurred in a chromosome that was

199
00:15:08,415 --> 00:15:12,771
carrying a G allele at SNP one and a C allele at SNP three.

200
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,130
Now you have another mutation, let's say the A mutation.

201
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:21,370
And it happened on the GTC background.

202
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:26,078
Now if you look at this population there are four different haplotypes

203
00:15:26,078 --> 00:15:30,490
that are observed but they're not the same as in population one.

204
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:35,320
And that's because it matters what the haplotype background is

205
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,921
where those new mutations occur.

206
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:45,091
So you have these really particular mutational histories of populations and

207
00:15:45,091 --> 00:15:48,070
they all have their unique haplotypes.

208
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:52,630
But those populations merged together over time through things like migration.

209
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:58,506
So this is showing migration patterns throughout history and

210
00:15:58,506 --> 00:16:03,026
is showing that there are mixing of populations

211
00:16:03,026 --> 00:16:07,211
that occur as people move geographically.

212
00:16:07,211 --> 00:16:11,858
So for example [COUGH] If you have these two different haplotype

213
00:16:11,858 --> 00:16:15,712
potentials in population one and population two.

214
00:16:15,712 --> 00:16:21,356
If these two populations merged together through migration or through things

215
00:16:21,356 --> 00:16:27,522
like intermarriage when they didn't used to have intermarriage or interbreeding.

216
00:16:27,522 --> 00:16:31,411
Now you've got a third population and has six different haplotypes.

217
00:16:31,411 --> 00:16:34,733
So all of the ones that were present in population one and

218
00:16:34,733 --> 00:16:37,001
the ones that were in population two.

219
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:42,280
So let's use a real example here.

220
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:47,900
So this chart is giving you the human leukocyte antigen haplotypes.

221
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:51,297
So you might have heard of things like organ donation.

222
00:16:51,297 --> 00:16:56,181
And when people donate organs they need to make sure that the human leukocyte

223
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,339
antigens match.

224
00:16:57,339 --> 00:17:02,120
You've heard about like when you are needing a kidney transplant you

225
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,620
have to find a match.

226
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:07,511
They're talking about matching these human leukocyte antigen haplotypes.

227
00:17:07,511 --> 00:17:14,171
So this chart is listing the different HLA haplotypes that can exist and

228
00:17:14,171 --> 00:17:19,630
the frequency that they occur in different populations.

229
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:24,670
And it ranks them from highest to lowest frequency within each ethnic group.

230
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:30,270
And this kind of tool can be used for finding matches on organ donation.

231
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:34,131
So for example if you go to haplotype 172,

232
00:17:34,131 --> 00:17:38,904
so they have a one haplotype at this first, androgen A,

233
00:17:38,904 --> 00:17:45,430
a seven haplotype at androgen B and a two haplotype at this third antigen DR.

234
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:50,233
0.53% of Caucasians have that haplotype and

235
00:17:50,233 --> 00:17:54,691
0.07% of Asians have that haplotype, so

236
00:17:54,691 --> 00:18:00,197
it's a little more common in Caucasians than in Asians.

237
00:18:00,197 --> 00:18:04,895
But it's found in all of these different ethnic groups cuz so

238
00:18:04,895 --> 00:18:09,408
we have Caucasian ancestry, African ancestry, Asian,

239
00:18:09,408 --> 00:18:12,462
Latino or Latina and native American.

240
00:18:12,462 --> 00:18:16,677
It's the 21st most common haplotype in Caucasians and

241
00:18:16,677 --> 00:18:20,270
the 262nd most common in Asians.

242
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:27,572
Another haplotype 152 has a 0.0093 frequency in Caucasians,

243
00:18:27,572 --> 00:18:33,075
but isn't found at all in the sample of African Asian or

244
00:18:33,075 --> 00:18:37,050
native Americans that they looked at.

245
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:41,648
So it's the 1300th most common haplotype in Caucasians but

246
00:18:41,648 --> 00:18:45,743
it's not found at all in some of the other ethnic groups.

247
00:18:45,743 --> 00:18:50,407
So this is really important because it illustrates that ancestral

248
00:18:50,407 --> 00:18:55,751
background is very important for things like organ donation and matching.

249
00:18:55,751 --> 00:18:59,711
And it's because of these different haplotypes within populations.

250
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:06,135
So if you think about it, each person has both a really deep ancestral and

251
00:19:06,135 --> 00:19:08,450
a very personal genetic history.

252
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:15,266
So if we look at generations and we assume average of 25 years per generation,

253
00:19:15,266 --> 00:19:21,082
here's you, here's your parents, here's your grandparents.

254
00:19:21,082 --> 00:19:26,500
If we go back just two generations you have four ancestors, right?

255
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:31,370
You've got two grandparents on each side, your moms and your dads.

256
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:34,300
And that's about 50 years in the past.

257
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:41,088
If you go back five generations you have 32 ancestors, that's only 125 years ago.

258
00:19:41,088 --> 00:19:45,892
If you go back 10 generations, that's over 1000 ancestors that you've had.

259
00:19:45,892 --> 00:19:50,685
And and you'll have contributions of the DNA of many of those people.

260
00:19:50,685 --> 00:19:54,704
And so you really are this mosaic combination of DNA.

261
00:19:54,704 --> 00:20:00,604
Of your ancestors and also new mutations that have arisen in each generation

262
00:20:00,604 --> 00:20:06,701
including the ones that make you you that are new generations that I'm sorry.

263
00:20:06,701 --> 00:20:08,773
New mutations that are found only in you.
