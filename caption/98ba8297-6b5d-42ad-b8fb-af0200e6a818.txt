1
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:43,820
Okay. That's. Good morning, everybody.

2
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:49,130
Yeah. Yeah. So, how's everybody doing?

3
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:55,750
Pretty good, maybe. Good. Okay. All right.

4
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:00,840
So. Welcome back. Good to see you.

5
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:09,800
Today, we will continue our week long unit on engaging stakeholders or invested parties.

6
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:14,100
Today will be interactive.

7
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:31,499
So put your talking caps on and we will basically will engage in a few activities that one might do if they are working on engagement.

8
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,820
And so that's different as we talked about the different aspects of engagement.

9
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:43,430
On Tuesday, it's about learning from the people that you're working with.

10
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:50,630
But even before that, there are things like making decisions about who will be engaged.

11
00:02:50,640 --> 00:03:01,800
Because the truth is, is that not everybody is really itching to be part of a evaluation planning board or group or council.

12
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:12,570
But also not everybody needs to be on a an advisory group or a council or team.

13
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:23,829
So today we'll talk about these strategies and just go through a few examples and then I'll just again give

14
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:30,310
you the reminder about the email assignment and make sure there are no outstanding questions at the end.

15
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:40,760
So let's begin. So strategies for engaging parties and evaluation activities.

16
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:52,970
You know, remember back at the beginning of the course, I said that evaluation practice is, among other things, systematic.

17
00:03:53,420 --> 00:04:02,420
And so engagement strategies help us to be able to be systematic and deliberate about how we involve others in the evaluation.

18
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:10,970
And so there are different. Objectives, if you will, that these strategies can address.

19
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:18,500
And we'll actually go through an example of a strategy for each of these bullet points.

20
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:23,550
One identify and manage power dynamics.

21
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:30,810
We've talked a lot about power so far. Who have power to influence the evaluation?

22
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:38,550
Who has power to derail an evaluation? We also use strategies to develop plans for engagement.

23
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:43,500
This is a good example of being systematic and deliberate.

24
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:56,370
And part of what you'll be doing for your evaluation plan is actually developing a stakeholder plan as part of that group assignment.

25
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:03,200
Another reason why we use these strategies to promote collaboration and communication,

26
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:13,110
especially when we are thinking about adopting approaches such as culturally responsive and equitable evaluation,

27
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:18,240
participatory evaluation, empowerment, evaluation.

28
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:23,370
These are approaches where collaboration and communication are key.

29
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:33,569
But even if communication even if we're not using one of those approaches, it behooves us at the very least,

30
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:42,600
to make sure that the people that we're working with are communicating with each other, as well as us evaluators communicating with them.

31
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:50,100
And then finally, we use strategies to facilitate participatory decision making.

32
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,050
It's easy for, you know,

33
00:05:53,070 --> 00:06:06,570
GAM given power dynamics for one voice or two voices to be the lead and to gloss over those voices that are not being represented in the conversation.

34
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,690
So we use strategies to try to equalize,

35
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:23,520
equalize the situation and make sure that everyone has some input into the decisions that are being made about things such as data collection tools,

36
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:28,770
who will receive evaluation information at the end and etc.

37
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:37,440
So the first place we'll start is thinking about identifying and managing power dynamics.

38
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:44,850
And so we'll do that in practicing using a power and interest grid.

39
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:53,790
Has anyone, you know, for my organizers in the room done any power analysis?

40
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:58,020
Like a political power analysis? I see one on.

41
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:03,450
Another hand, this is very similar. It's pretty much the same thing.

42
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:10,290
But it is phrased in the from the perspective of evaluation, involvement.

43
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:18,420
And really, what we're doing with this grid is trying to identify whose interests need to be taken into account.

44
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:28,140
And that, again, is not about thinking about, okay, who do we who's important and otherwise who's excluded.

45
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:31,680
But the truth is, we do operate in the political environment.

46
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,980
And so it's important to think about, okay,

47
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:45,630
who's who has the power in this conversation and in this larger context of the program and its implementation.

48
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:53,900
So so some considerations about what we mean when we talk about power and interest power.

49
00:07:54,110 --> 00:08:00,290
What we're talking about is the potential ability to affect the evaluation process or use of findings.

50
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:03,249
And when we talk about interest,

51
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:11,410
what we're talking about is this degree of attentiveness to the political aspects of the evaluation process or use of findings.

52
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:22,240
So it's important to distinguish. Curiosity or intellectual interest from a political interest.

53
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:29,469
I can be really interested in the book, but that doesn't mean from an intellectual perspective,

54
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:34,810
but that doesn't mean that I'm going to use the learnings for some political purpose.

55
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:43,210
And in the same way I can be really interested intellectually and evaluation, but not be.

56
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:52,599
Intention and, you know, intentional about thinking about that use of that evaluation.

57
00:08:52,600 --> 00:09:01,960
And so what we're talking about is that degree of attentiveness to political aspects, the implications of the evaluation.

58
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:15,100
So the way that a grid the grid is structured is structured in four sections of a matrix, two by two where.

59
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:23,090
I'm not going to play around with y Xs and Xs. Xs, because Lord knows I don't always remember it, but.

60
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:30,620
The horizontal line is the kind of horizontal and vertical.

61
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:34,060
I'm like, Mate, that's not horizontal. Horizontal.

62
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:38,680
Is interest. Where?

63
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:51,790
Low interest. Is in high interest.

64
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:58,330
Is intersecting with. High power.

65
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:15,160
And low power. And so there's four, roughly four groups that you could place either people or organizations on in this group, this grid.

66
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:23,500
So for those who are high power and high interest, we would call them players.

67
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:31,350
And keep in mind that this is the terminology from Patton and Bryson.

68
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:43,500
There might be other terminology from other other evaluator slash authors, but just know that the idea and the concept is usually the same.

69
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:55,240
High power, low interest contact centers, and then your low power high interest are subjects in your low power.

70
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:58,420
Low interest. Is the crowd.

71
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:11,200
So your players, they have great interest in the effort and so the evaluation and they have the power to make it successful or to derail it.

72
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:22,460
And so these people are off the or organizations are often brought in to serve as primary are brought in as a primary user of the evaluation.

73
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,520
That's where they also tend to fall.

74
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:37,960
But there may also be particular parties that are involved in the administration of the program or have some political,

75
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:43,360
political objective to gain from the project.

76
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:50,630
Your subjects have a vested interest and they can voice their support in the community.

77
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:59,440
But they really have little actual. Concrete political power to influence that effort in any way.

78
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:04,120
So it is important to support and enhance their involvement.

79
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:12,850
Again, thinking about your principles of organizing and building a base of support.

80
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:21,100
Subjects may be able to end the influence from the influence and the community become players.

81
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:33,430
So it is important to think about how you can collaborate and partner with subjects, especially if they have a visible presence in the community.

82
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:43,330
But one thing to keep in mind, remember, as I mentioned on Tuesday, not everybody was visible or loud.

83
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,470
Has the interest of the community at heart.

84
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,960
And this is this goes for everybody, by the way.

85
00:12:52,040 --> 00:13:00,020
So when thinking about working with subjects, especially those who are community representatives, community activists,

86
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:10,910
etc., etc., keep in mind you want to also be attentive to whether they are accountable to community.

87
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:21,220
Your contact centers. They really have no particular interest in that or involvement in the evaluation or the program,

88
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:26,470
but have a lot of power to influence it greatly if they become interested.

89
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:37,300
So those might be, for example, your legislature, your legislators, your municipal leaders such as mayors, city council members.

90
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:45,290
You think you engage them if they're likely the goals, barriers to process and or use.

91
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:52,280
And so that means again, thinking about context, learning about the context in which you're doing the evaluation,

92
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:59,690
not just because it helps you understand the findings, but because it helps with dissemination.

93
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:05,670
And this is a perfect example. And then finally, the crowd.

94
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:10,500
I can't help myself. I have to do this for it. I don't know if you have ever seen it.

95
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:14,429
CROWD But I can't resist. I have little.

96
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:19,230
I realize that's why I kept affectionately looking at the crowd as I was typing this.

97
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:28,020
That's a TV show. The crowd has little interest and little power and may not, even though the effort exists.

98
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:47,310
Generally, this tends to be. Program beneficiaries who are engaging with the evaluation because they are, you know, participating in the intervention.

99
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,360
And it's helpful. It's helpful to keep them interested and neutral.

100
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:56,100
And this could also be people who fall into the crowd.

101
00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:12,360
Could also be those who. Could be those who have some political power but are a little bit more distant from the effort.

102
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:20,770
So I'm going to say, for example, like a. Like a federal.

103
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:26,820
Legislator. They do have. They may not have power in this situation.

104
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:31,560
So it's helpful to think about do they have power in this particular situation?

105
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:41,210
And like I said, is helpful to keep them informed and neutral because what you don't want are members of the crowd.

106
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:49,560
One realizing what power they have, and that's not in a negative ha ha ha, you know, twist your mustache kind of way.

107
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:57,780
But and in a, you know, a thought, a thoughtful way, you want to you don't want people to realize,

108
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:02,760
oh, I actually can derail this initiative or this evaluation process.

109
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:08,820
So you do want to think about wisely. How do I engage?

110
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:19,470
It's helpful to do an analysis like this in conjunction with the next step, which is the stakeholder analysis table.

111
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:28,700
So we are going to do an exercise. And the key word here is imagination.

112
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:33,210
Because I am aware that even with this.

113
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:44,600
Draw a little rainbow because. Imagination because I realized that you just have one paragraph of information.

114
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:55,340
So the point of the exercise today is to think about different ways people might fit within one of these four boxes.

115
00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:03,650
So I'm going to say that in real life, you probably wouldn't place a person in two boxes,

116
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:14,150
but because you'll know more context about whether or not they have power, they don't have power, for example, but for today.

117
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,900
What I want you to do is just kind of think through it.

118
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:24,690
So, I mean, take students, you might place students in two different places based on your justification.

119
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:37,020
So it's okay to make some stuff up. So I'll write the scenario and then I am going to start looking to you to fill in this table.

120
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:43,020
So you you are working with American Heart Association, Michigan chapter.

121
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:49,860
The program you are evaluating is a school based heart health education program,

122
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:54,900
and it's designed for middle school students, those wonderful middle school students.

123
00:17:56,230 --> 00:18:00,670
My daughters are middle school students. I'm so glad I'm not in middle school anymore.

124
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:09,640
Ah, they operate in 100 public secondary schools in the state with all sixth graders.

125
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:16,680
So in this mythical Michigan place. Where there are schools that are participating.

126
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:25,170
Every single sixth grader has to participate. So that means that they're all required to take one semester of health to accommodate the program.

127
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:30,440
Otherwise they don't. There's no state requirement to take health.

128
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:35,100
It's just that in the districts that are implementing it, they have to take health.

129
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,210
So they so that the sixth graders can participate.

130
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:44,150
While the American Heart Association sponsors most calls for the program.

131
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:51,350
Some costs are funded by the Michigan Department of Education at 5 million a year, which is not a whole lot.

132
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:59,320
But it's enough. So who are some potential parties that you need to consider and where would you place them?

133
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:04,630
I'll give you a second to thank. And then when?

134
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:15,970
And feel free also to write these things on your notes if you are not feeling particularly cheerful and wanting to talk.

135
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:25,600
So any idea is what's once what's one party that you would need to consider?

136
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:40,840
Oh, sorry. I think we. They have their.

137
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:56,370
Okay. So the idea do this, they have to participate so they probably care.

138
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:02,220
I apologize. I'm going to do it for them because I don't know everybody's name. I'm going to do clothes.

139
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,330
So red shirt. Tabitha.

140
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:12,960
I would see. And I. And in the crowd.

141
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:18,030
See? Why?

142
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:23,060
Well, let's let's explore that. So, parents, you put them in the car.

143
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:26,190
Why? Because on average they.

144
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:32,920
Kimball. So to speak.

145
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:39,720
But they do have a lot of power. And the crowd.

146
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:54,520
And I think that's like an example of how one can move from here, from the crown to the contact center.

147
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:57,620
So, parents. Getting concerned.

148
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:17,100
Samina. So which board members?

149
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:28,210
And the district ones. You said the Department of Education and the District ones.

150
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:35,080
Yeah. Okay. So, board members, I'm actually up to the line and then I'm going to put school board members.

151
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:50,540
Both Michigan Department of and Board members.

152
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,070
And because I know that everybody knows.

153
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:04,209
And now you know about school board members. But just a quick aside,

154
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:11,890
that there are actually technically supposed to be advisory boards for some of these bigger

155
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:17,980
state departments like the Department of Labor actually has like a council advisory council.

156
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:24,880
So that's what I was referring to. Uh, any other.

157
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:52,080
Program and. And then now and I'm I'm just going to say it's their job for the board members to realize we didn't actually put.

158
00:22:54,370 --> 00:23:07,200
Reasons why. Let's do a couple more.

159
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:13,710
Okay. I must have a lecture. I'm sorry.

160
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:34,480
I'm really bad with names. So. So they teach but don't decide curriculum.

161
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:50,630
Oh. And then I saw a hand in the back with the black mask.

162
00:23:53,300 --> 00:24:08,390
Bridget. Evil?

163
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:15,430
No. Evil and stubborn sometimes.

164
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:20,209
I'm telling you, I'm like. I'd listen to my daughter's stories.

165
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:23,300
I'm like, I really do not miss this. But yeah. So they could yeah.

166
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:27,260
So they can depend on know, I mean.

167
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:36,440
Where would you put them? Okay.

168
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:42,640
So stay. Govt officials and why won't you?

169
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:46,620
So why would you put them in player's place? Because someone might.

170
00:24:48,670 --> 00:25:41,950
Okay. Yeah.

171
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:48,780
So the point members was making is that. Especially with some of these.

172
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:51,330
No. Go away.

173
00:25:55,490 --> 00:26:04,850
Some of the bigger associations like American Heart Association, the state chapters have a lot of autonomy and they can get their own funds.

174
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:08,570
So. Right.

175
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:43,310
They are chill. They are not chill. Complaining on next door.

176
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:49,190
Anybody have next door? Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

177
00:26:50,550 --> 00:27:01,500
Oh you should have thought when the 80 a military was coming that oh lord they were the Bravo and any other ones.

178
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:14,510
So other teachers. And why would you put those in the crowd?

179
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:29,020
Never mind. Well.

180
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:41,579
So. Okay. So and let anybody else.

181
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:47,040
I just have a burning one they want to put on. This will be the last one. But you like others?

182
00:27:48,030 --> 00:28:17,549
I would. I forgot.

183
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:47,620
You said players would be the other one. I think. Right.

184
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:56,390
So as you can see from this, just even starting to think through this without much information at all,

185
00:28:56,660 --> 00:29:05,390
we were able to fill in a lot of pieces and also think about ways that people in organizations might.

186
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:10,660
You know, engage or how their engagement might change.

187
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:22,330
And so one thing that's helpful is that there's already some questions that have emerged, at least for me, in looking at this process.

188
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:25,810
So, for example, take the school board members.

189
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:36,490
Okay. So are there some school board members who may be particularly concerned and so should I speak with them?

190
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:47,140
There might be some that are not as concerned. And so I might keep them informed and just be aware of their perspectives on the issue.

191
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:54,969
PARENT Some sometimes, you know, some parents are like, okay, whatever.

192
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:58,120
You know, you're going to learn how to, you know, be heart healthy. That's awesome.

193
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:03,940
But some parents might think, why does my child have to take health?

194
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:12,130
And they might even be like, we're proxy issues. Like if they because they have to take health, they now have to learn sex ed.

195
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:21,220
And so you might not think about that automatically, but if you are a parent who has ever had a sixth grader who has to take health,

196
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:28,210
you know, you can expect this packet of information about how they're going to learn about sex.

197
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:40,569
And people might get riled up. And so those nuances are really helpful to think through when you're thinking about a

198
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:47,200
program and how it's evaluated and how you engage people in the evaluation process.

199
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:55,450
So that's one example. You can do it before.

200
00:30:56,410 --> 00:31:02,110
It might be helpful to think through some questions you have to ask your kind of primary contact.

201
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:09,910
You can do it after you identify the team so you know who can, you know, needs to continue to be engaged.

202
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:20,230
So that's one example. So another reason that we would use strategies to develop plans for engagement.

203
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:25,700
So you can see that like that power and interest grip. How many people fall?

204
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:29,229
Think about how many people fall within those groups. Take the school board.

205
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:32,790
I mean, that's what probably about. Roughly.

206
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:38,330
I don't actually know how many people have to be on a school board, but I'd say roughly like six or seven.

207
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:42,770
That's six or seven people alone that you have to think about.

208
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:50,660
How do you keep all these people organized? So one tool that we use is a stakeholder analysis.

209
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:58,730
And this is a way of determining who among stakeholders can have the most positive or negative influence on that effort.

210
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:09,020
Who's likely to be most affected by the effort and how you should work with them when there is different levels of of interest and power?

211
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:25,400
So why would we conduct this one? We would conduct it to know who will be asked to engage in evaluation, planning, implementation and dissemination.

212
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:30,860
So we might conduct this we might conduct this with our primary contests.

213
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:34,730
Or when I say contexts, because I realize this sounds like context.

214
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:42,160
Contacts. I realize I'm like, those words sound very much the same.

215
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:50,500
Another reason we would conduct this type of analysis to identify the influence each stakeholder has on the evaluation.

216
00:32:51,070 --> 00:33:02,140
So similar to the power and interest grid, we would account for power and interest on this stakeholder table.

217
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:09,440
And so you could take the information, for example, from the grid and put it into a table.

218
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:15,310
And then finally we conduct it to make informed decisions about how to manage stakeholders.

219
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:21,220
And the example that I'm going to show you next is leaning on this third part.

220
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:26,080
And so just to keep in mind, there's different templates for this.

221
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:37,620
The template I'm showing you now is really just about understanding how do I manage these people and not just have it be.

222
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:43,470
What's a lot of us do? Even myself. How?

223
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:46,980
By instinct. How? You know, how do I manage this relationship?

224
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:54,030
Instinct. You also want to think about it systematically.

225
00:33:56,590 --> 00:34:08,469
So the again, the table that I'm going to show you next is built on to resemble this continuum of public participation that you've

226
00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:19,720
seen a few times where you're moving you're looking at moving community engagement from this very one sided.

227
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:36,120
Very. An equitable power relationship of outreach and thinking about how you will operate with those and a sense of shared power.

228
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:46,000
Shared leadership. And again, not everybody that you engage is going to need to be at this end of the continuum.

229
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:48,990
Some will stay here,

230
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:59,050
but it's helpful to know systematically who is going to stay there and why there and what you're going to or how you're going to engage them.

231
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:09,980
So this table. On the left side.

232
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:21,260
Is where you would place the type of involvement. And so that that type of involvement could be elements of communication and relationship building.

233
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:29,210
Um, so, for example, in the reading, if this promise evaluator makes, which I thought was really interesting.

234
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:38,510
Like, we do make promises, I should be more thoughtful about that in the future because it is related to accountability.

235
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:45,200
I think also it's helpful to think through different stages in the evaluation.

236
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:50,950
Um. And then the rest of the columns.

237
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:58,290
Are moving from the left end of that public participation continuum.

238
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:06,780
To the to the right. So you start with do not engage.

239
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:11,440
And these are actions that you would take if the party is not engaged.

240
00:36:12,490 --> 00:36:18,610
So, for example, if we're trying to model how we would engage people in developing a logic model,

241
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:25,360
which you'll be doing next week, if you're not engaging them well, you're not engaged in engaging them.

242
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:33,390
So it's pretty straightforward, right? If you are engaging someone as a data source.

243
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:44,210
In that column, you're putting how you would interact with somebody if the party is all is engaged as a data source.

244
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:56,030
I put only in parentheses because well, sometimes people are data sources and some and then they're also they are engaged in other ways.

245
00:36:57,870 --> 00:37:07,910
And so in this case, for logic model development, the example is a party is recruited for interviews or surveys related to logic model development.

246
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:14,400
I might send them a survey to say, okay, well, what activities were most important to you?

247
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,350
When you participate in it, for example.

248
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:28,220
If you are informing somebody, though, these are actions that you would take as an evaluator if the party will only be receiving information.

249
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:38,150
And so that might be, for example, that crowd. In the case of logic model development, a party will receive a final version of the logic model,

250
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:42,830
so you'll keep them informed, but not engaging them in the development process.

251
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:51,490
Consultation. Those are actions that you are taking and the parties being solicited for feedback or information.

252
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:58,450
And so in this example, a party would be asked if the language in the logic model is culturally sound.

253
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:04,790
That's an example of consulting. You're not really consulting them about the meat of the logic model.

254
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:12,100
It's really just about some of the kind of fine tuning or refining of the logic model in this case language.

255
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:15,330
Involving that step.

256
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:24,270
If those are actions that you would take, if and if you as the evaluator, will maintain a cooperative relationship with the party.

257
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:30,670
And so they may not be part of that decision making, but it's a relationship that you want to maintain.

258
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:35,639
In this case, I might engage them in the development meeting.

259
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:39,840
So, you know, the fun meeting where you decide what boxes fit where,

260
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:47,910
but you really don't expect them to attend and that happens that people believe or not, that happens all the time.

261
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:51,960
We should invite so-and-so, but they're probably not coming.

262
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:56,750
And it's because we know that based on you need to maintain that relationship.

263
00:38:57,730 --> 00:39:02,980
So if you've ever heard somebody say that, that's why they know the relationship is important, but they're not coming.

264
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,770
You know they're not coming. Collaborate.

265
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:11,910
You probably have friends like that to write like you invited them, but then they like we're not in that common.

266
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:15,930
That's me. I'm ever come. I'm tired.

267
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:26,670
I'm. I'm tired. Collaborate. So those are actions that you would take as a evaluator if you in the party are working in partnership,

268
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:32,940
but the evaluator is maintaining this decision making power and this does happen sometime.

269
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:38,100
This is especially the case when you're talking about technical decisions like data collection.

270
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,340
How long to make a survey.

271
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:51,160
Those kinds of decisions where people tend to think that there's some super high level technical knowledge that you, me or like analysis.

272
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:54,579
So like I know I don't know how to run it in vivo.

273
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:58,630
So you evaluate or go ahead and run it any way you see fit.

274
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:06,560
So I might engage that party and logic in the logic model development meeting and we do expect them to come.

275
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:09,130
I've been finally in power.

276
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:19,450
So these are actions that I would take if me, myself and the party are working in partnership and the party maintains decision making power.

277
00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:27,340
In this case, they're not only engaged, but they have final say on all materials and content.

278
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:33,200
So that's and that's an example of this table.

279
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:38,880
So we're going to try and walk through it. And I am going to pick a type of involvement.

280
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:46,710
But you all are going to fill it out. So the type of involvement that we are going to do is.

281
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:53,370
Deciding. On.

282
00:40:54,970 --> 00:41:00,250
Who we will sample. So who we're going to collect data from.

283
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:15,530
All right. So if I. So you're the evaluator and you're trying to think about, okay,

284
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:21,790
who how would I interact with somebody that I don't plan to engage even for data collection?

285
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:39,490
This was pretty much a throwaway. Do not engage. And similarly, to save you, save you the the anxiety of trying to figure out what to do here.

286
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:44,380
Engage as a data source. You will recruit them.

287
00:41:45,310 --> 00:41:49,900
That's all you're going to do. If you are engaging them as a data source.

288
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:59,060
Here's where it gets fun to think through. Okay.

289
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:03,230
So if I am engaging somebody.

290
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:09,880
And by only giving them information about deciding who we will sample.

291
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:20,600
What might I put here? And I'm going to say I gave you the answer.

292
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:27,220
Yes. Yeah.

293
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:35,560
So letting them know. Who?

294
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:42,430
I am. Recruiting or we are recruiting.

295
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:48,870
Right. What if I am consulting them? So how?

296
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:54,200
If I'm going to solicit them for feedback or information, how am I engage them at this?

297
00:42:55,250 --> 00:42:58,430
Or in this type of involvement or activity.

298
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:14,700
Give them a list. Yeah.

299
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:23,930
So give them a list. Uh.

300
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:30,480
People. We're considering and get feedback.

301
00:43:36,610 --> 00:43:46,790
And now this with this example. We're giving them something that is kind of already half baked, right, where that's like kind of halfway there.

302
00:43:47,090 --> 00:43:57,890
And sometimes somebody might be consulted because they, for example, have a lot of power and interest, but they really don't have a lot of time.

303
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:04,430
So, you know, we bring them in at a later stage in the decision making process.

304
00:44:04,610 --> 00:44:15,350
So, you know, we we work within the time that some of our parties have involved.

305
00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:19,340
So I'm going to maintain a cooperative relationship with the party.

306
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:26,710
They may not respond, but. I still want to maintain that relationship.

307
00:44:28,570 --> 00:44:36,990
How might I engage them? And I should say one thing I didn't say it can be the same.

308
00:44:46,990 --> 00:44:57,310
I mean, I would. Or potentially.

309
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:15,760
My. Yeah.

310
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:24,510
Now. So, you know, you could do the same thing, give them a list or invite them to.

311
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:32,880
Brainstorming meeting, but. And see what they decide to do.

312
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:37,760
And you could also give options. We do that too.

313
00:45:38,090 --> 00:45:42,969
Like. Okay. Really important person to me in my heart.

314
00:45:42,970 --> 00:45:50,020
And, you know, politically speaking, whether you like us to give you a list or would you like to come to the meeting?

315
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:59,680
Some time and then but. And, you know, from a practical perspective, it might be, okay, we're going to plan the meeting.

316
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:07,660
Hopefully you can make it versus well, we're going to make sure that we hold it at a time that you can make it.

317
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:17,080
And these decisions seem small, but in the long run they can turn out big because they can switch somebody from one of those four boxes,

318
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:21,820
for example, all you don't involve me, I'll show you because people can be petty.

319
00:46:23,950 --> 00:46:27,190
And I was a bit trying to be funny that time. People just can be petty.

320
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:34,180
I know their mom would get myself fire from this job. People can be petty.

321
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:37,390
I love you. Faculty members. They gave me a degree. I know you can hear me.

322
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:52,340
Collaborate. So I am working in partnership and but I'm going to make some, you know, I'm going to end up V yang or making the decision.

323
00:46:52,500 --> 00:47:14,550
So how am I engage them? And.

324
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:33,970
Wait. I didn't hear the last part. Maybe. Yeah.

325
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:47,040
So. And you know, and speaking to this.

326
00:47:49,730 --> 00:47:53,150
Second, second point collaborate on whom to recruit.

327
00:47:53,420 --> 00:48:00,530
So what that looks like in practice is it's one thing for me to say you should recruit blah blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

328
00:48:02,470 --> 00:48:05,720
It's another thing for me to say, okay, who should we recruit?

329
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:08,770
What are your thoughts and what is your justification?

330
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:16,330
Part of the engagement, remember, is about you learning about this program in this context.

331
00:48:17,350 --> 00:48:28,850
With a t t. So when you ask questions in a way that invites discussion, you learn more from that.

332
00:48:28,910 --> 00:48:38,140
So again, it's the difference between saying, okay, what do you I think we should recruit these people.

333
00:48:40,610 --> 00:48:47,280
What are your thoughts about that? And sometimes when you're working with clients, they do want you to do that.

334
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:49,940
But you also part of the scale is kind of.

335
00:48:51,210 --> 00:48:57,660
Getting them out of that practice, of assuming that you are the expert and really opening up the conversation to say,

336
00:48:57,660 --> 00:49:04,110
okay, I'm not the expert, you're the expert, why should we and why should we recruit these particular people?

337
00:49:04,470 --> 00:49:08,460
And so that's where this idea of collaboration is, is important.

338
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:17,050
And then I would say similarly for this last one, I'm in power.

339
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:24,490
It's important to collaborate. How well how do we do that?

340
00:49:24,730 --> 00:49:31,720
What are some other actions I might take? Oh, sorry.

341
00:49:37,850 --> 00:49:45,510
A lot of well analysis. This an.

342
00:49:57,650 --> 00:50:08,740
No. Yeah. So again, thinking about, especially when you're taking this perspective of empowerment, it's really about again,

343
00:50:08,770 --> 00:50:18,850
building capacity in the community and the organization to be able to do this work themselves.

344
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:27,910
Evaluators cost money and I don't have a desire to work myself out of a job, but.

345
00:50:29,190 --> 00:50:37,530
You know, even as an evaluator, especially with this perspective, I acknowledge that it's more important for funds to go to programing than.

346
00:50:38,470 --> 00:50:41,860
You know me and my trip last year to Universal Studios.

347
00:50:43,030 --> 00:50:46,320
So. Yeah.

348
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:52,959
It was a bonus year, so. And I'm very I was very grateful for that.

349
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:57,850
But ultimately, I want more money to go into programing.

350
00:50:58,330 --> 00:51:05,560
So how can I in this process help build the capacity of the organization so they don't need my services in the future?

351
00:51:08,250 --> 00:51:11,520
And trust me, you will never run out of business. But.

352
00:51:13,490 --> 00:51:17,620
Maybe you won't work with the same people twice. I don't know.

353
00:51:21,410 --> 00:51:25,660
So you see how like that? Do you see how there's different nuances?

354
00:51:25,670 --> 00:51:33,559
I mean, again, it may seem small, but these nuances in how you engage people can make a difference in how the

355
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:37,730
relationship is structured and how people feel about the evaluation process.

356
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:49,130
And so again, you can refer to this the entire time, like because especially when it gets busy, it can be hard to say, okay, what I do, what I do.

357
00:51:49,550 --> 00:51:57,190
Here you have a handy dandy stakeholder table that you can intersect with the power and interest grid.

358
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:05,810
You can, you know, if you love playing with Excel, I have no idea what I just did.

359
00:52:08,710 --> 00:52:13,690
I don't know how to get out of this. Oh, man.

360
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:18,700
I get it all now. Okay.

361
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:25,230
Oh, come on. Let me see if I can get out of this.

362
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:30,740
Oh, no, I don't want to do that. You know what? Oh.

363
00:52:30,810 --> 00:52:35,210
Okay. Okay. Yeah.

364
00:52:36,690 --> 00:52:43,610
Okay. I like Mau Mau now.

365
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:47,820
I don't know what to do. It's a nightmare.

366
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:57,970
That's it for this lecture. And I'm here to say I know professors have nightmares about stuff like, okay, so.

367
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:02,760
So the best example, developing plans for engagement.

368
00:53:04,290 --> 00:53:07,770
The third one is promoting collaboration and communication.

369
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:11,760
You want people to talk to each other.

370
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:23,660
You know, sometimes you get a group and they all know each other and they're really tight and they have relationships that are strong, very cohesive.

371
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:30,400
They they work together. They partner together. Will sometimes you bring together people where that is not the case.

372
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:39,190
And so we need strategies to be able to kind of close the gap, if you will, either gaps in knowledge.

373
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:45,730
Coming to a common idea of values is a big one.

374
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:53,390
So one thing, one kind of example of a group of strategies is interactive evaluation practice.

375
00:53:54,260 --> 00:53:58,209
So some key terms. IP.

376
00:53:58,210 --> 00:54:06,780
That's the intentional act of engaging people and making decisions, taking action and reflecting while conducting an evaluation study.

377
00:54:08,830 --> 00:54:23,910
Another key term is facilitation. And that refers to the plans and actions evaluators make and take to engage with stakeholders directly,

378
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:30,930
as well as to engage stakeholders with each other in ways that support constructive evaluation processes.

379
00:54:30,990 --> 00:54:34,650
Processes likely to produce useful results.

380
00:54:36,730 --> 00:54:44,170
Part of what IIP is built on is that your parties are going to have to engage.

381
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:52,410
In one or multiple of three basic ways, they're going to respond to something.

382
00:54:52,430 --> 00:55:01,670
So you got a list, you got a question, they're going to give you some new information or you're asking them to organize information.

383
00:55:02,910 --> 00:55:11,430
So for example, responding to something we just talked about that the list of people to sample, giving the information.

384
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:17,780
Who should we sample? And organizing information to take that a step further.

385
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:21,410
We might, you know, say we're limited on the resources.

386
00:55:21,710 --> 00:55:26,810
Who should we make sure we sample? That would be an example of organizing information.

387
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:46,240
So there is in the article you read today, a baker's dozen or so 13 that that Jean King and Laurie Stevens have presented.

388
00:55:47,230 --> 00:55:50,799
But there's an entire book of these things.

389
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:56,260
And I'm telling you again, going to, you know, nerd, nerd land.

390
00:55:56,680 --> 00:56:01,660
So I have a friend who's we met when we worked together in the evaluation center.

391
00:56:02,170 --> 00:56:05,320
And you should have seen this the day he got the book first.

392
00:56:05,710 --> 00:56:08,710
And we were, like, sitting in his office, like, you've got the book. Let's look at the book.

393
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:12,879
Like, we don't have anything else to do. The book you got the book is Go. Let's look at it.

394
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:25,060
Let's look at it together. It's cool. And then we also got to meet Jean King in Minnesota, and she gave us a ride somewhere we were.

395
00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:31,090
So we're sitting in the back like it was Michael Jackson driving the car like you believe it.

396
00:56:31,090 --> 00:56:35,079
Do like it is Michael Jackson. I mean, Jean King driving this car.

397
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:41,090
She's driving that somewhere. It was it was it was total in there moment.

398
00:56:41,110 --> 00:56:51,780
We were so excited. So, you know, suffice to say, we like and I like interactive evaluation strategies.

399
00:56:51,790 --> 00:56:55,930
I like to engage with people and get them invested in the process.

400
00:56:57,130 --> 00:57:02,500
So how do you choose facilitation activities? What outcomes are you looking for?

401
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:08,920
Do you want people to respond to information? For example, how much time is available?

402
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:16,300
Some of these strategies take a long time. And so, again, thinking about funding time equals money as well.

403
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:22,480
And then finally, what level of engagement does each strategy require?

404
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:27,640
And this is helpful. I mean, you might there's, you know, some practical aspects.

405
00:57:28,150 --> 00:57:31,720
Do you have if this is an interactive physical activity?

406
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:37,060
Do you have people who have ability issues that you need to consider?

407
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:38,980
This happened to me Saturday.

408
00:57:40,090 --> 00:57:47,620
I have a woman who was participating in a planning session who was in a wheelchair that I did not know about before I got there.

409
00:57:48,220 --> 00:57:55,060
So I quickly kind of think through, okay, how can I adjust this activity so that I can,

410
00:57:55,690 --> 00:58:00,400
you know, minimize the amount of times we are moving around the room?

411
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:12,530
So practical aspects, but even culturally, sometimes you're working with the thought of working with people who don't.

412
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:25,580
They're not used to the engagement. I learned this the hard way by trying to engage a bunch of medical researchers and health care scientists.

413
00:58:25,790 --> 00:58:37,280
You know, in a health care system, in this super playful dust bowl, they write things on big easel, paper type activity.

414
00:58:38,590 --> 00:58:42,100
It was it it it it worked.

415
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:45,760
But from a cultural perspective, it was a disaster.

416
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:49,550
They hated it. They were like, What are we doing? Why are we not?

417
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:54,409
Why are we not talking about p values? Why are we not talking?

418
00:58:54,410 --> 00:58:58,490
And why are we not talking about indicators? We should be doing that.

419
00:58:58,940 --> 00:59:02,930
They were not happy. So you have to think about that as well culturally.

420
00:59:03,860 --> 00:59:10,160
There are some similar tools, so this isn't the only cluster of tools that I would recommend.

421
00:59:10,940 --> 00:59:16,940
Liberating structures is a facilitation tool that the structures are strategies.

422
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:22,610
Those are really fun and about getting people to collaborate and communicate.

423
00:59:23,030 --> 00:59:29,820
Participatory decision making is a strategy by a canter for facilitation.

424
00:59:29,870 --> 00:59:41,520
It also has useful activities. Building evaluation capacity is actually a book, has multiple versions and additions.

425
00:59:42,350 --> 00:59:44,400
Bar press kill and the press these.

426
00:59:44,420 --> 00:59:54,880
And so these are examples of other places and other resources where you can get activities or if you're just trained as a teacher or know a teacher.

427
00:59:54,980 --> 00:59:59,080
I discovered. A lot of them know these things.

428
01:00:01,380 --> 01:00:11,250
So one example, Jigsaw and Jigsaw is essentially used to engage a group in conversation about a topic which parties are not knowledgeable about.

429
01:00:13,170 --> 01:00:22,080
So for example, again, this Saturday I had a group that knew a lot about the community we were working

430
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:26,580
in and a group that knew nothing about the community we were working in.

431
01:00:26,940 --> 01:00:32,910
And in fact, they came from a different socioeconomic and physical space.

432
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:41,670
So this conversation was about, okay, what do you see as a community's assets?

433
01:00:43,650 --> 01:00:48,870
I have them divide into their groups. One was a group of board members.

434
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:52,380
Another was a group of community council members.

435
01:00:53,040 --> 01:01:01,230
They got together, spent 15 minutes talking to each other and listing things they felt were the assets.

436
01:01:01,710 --> 01:01:09,690
Then in that second stage, what I did is have them split those groups and brought together half a group.

437
01:01:09,690 --> 01:01:14,520
A half a group. So half of the council, half of the board.

438
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:20,490
Then they shared what that their groups, their respective groups talked about.

439
01:01:22,740 --> 01:01:26,340
And then they also share reflections and thoughts on what they heard.

440
01:01:27,310 --> 01:01:31,830
So benefit of this one, this is these are groups that have never really worked together.

441
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:37,799
So there was a certain amount of level setting that happened about what are the community's assets.

442
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:45,330
Because honestly and I think some you know, a lot of them would be open and saying this,

443
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:51,540
they didn't see what assets might exist in this particular community they were working for.

444
01:01:53,460 --> 01:02:00,720
So that, you know, that's the example of how I use it to help kind of set levels set in terms of values and assets.

445
01:02:02,310 --> 01:02:09,870
They also weren't used to working together, and so there were issues about who gets to make final say, who gets to make final decision.

446
01:02:10,410 --> 01:02:14,330
But you can't jump necessarily jump to that stuff right away.

447
01:02:14,340 --> 01:02:20,190
So you need to work with groups. And think about starting where they are.

448
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:24,130
So think about what I said on Tuesday. Start where they are.

449
01:02:24,460 --> 01:02:33,580
In this case, they were not knowledgeable and they came at community work from different approaches.

450
01:02:35,710 --> 01:02:41,350
So you have to think about. So this activity was really helpful in getting them to start thinking, Oh, okay,

451
01:02:41,530 --> 01:02:45,790
we really are on the same page as about what we understand about this community.

452
01:02:48,390 --> 01:02:54,720
And then the council was also able to say, okay, these board members really are coming from a good place,

453
01:02:56,700 --> 01:03:02,240
helping any way you can get those unspoken, unspoken tensions out into the open.

454
01:03:02,250 --> 01:03:06,990
It helps move the evaluation for in a more effective way.

455
01:03:08,940 --> 01:03:09,860
So that's what I mean.

456
01:03:09,870 --> 01:03:16,650
And, you know, truthfully, this is part of what makes evaluation a little different than scholarly research, too, because we're working with.

457
01:03:18,030 --> 01:03:26,820
Stakeholders are invested parties, and the results of the research that we're doing has real implications.

458
01:03:27,450 --> 01:03:35,620
How much money they can request from a funder. You know, can they help expand services?

459
01:03:36,070 --> 01:03:40,270
Can they get community buy in? So these are real results with real implications.

460
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:55,800
And so my last my last strategy that I want to you or expose you to is related to facilitating participatory decision making.

461
01:03:57,720 --> 01:04:01,140
Not all projects are going to meet tools like this.

462
01:04:07,590 --> 01:04:19,090
Because not all. Frankly, not all clients want to take on a participatory approach to evaluation.

463
01:04:20,820 --> 01:04:29,320
I learned that what the medical researchers, they don't they didn't care anything about participation or participation did not care at all.

464
01:04:30,010 --> 01:04:40,690
But more and more groups, especially given 20, 20 and all of the many things that expose about them equities.

465
01:04:41,020 --> 01:04:49,690
More and more clients are looking for evaluations that not only produce data,

466
01:04:49,690 --> 01:04:55,750
produce information and results, they are looking for evaluations that promote equity.

467
01:04:56,590 --> 01:05:04,520
And so as evaluators, we are in the process showing how do you mirror the, you know,

468
01:05:04,570 --> 01:05:13,960
equitable principles and practice not just where we say we love equity, but how do you share power?

469
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:20,740
How do you ensure that what you're doing is responding to what community wants?

470
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:30,280
So this is an example of a tool that I will use to help groups start to understand How do you share power in decision making?

471
01:05:34,060 --> 01:05:39,370
After I made the floor, I realized how hard it was to read. So here is a picture.

472
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:47,290
Of the gradients of agreement and the way this is used essentially and this is from caner.

473
01:05:47,300 --> 01:05:50,780
So the participatory decision making.

474
01:05:53,290 --> 01:06:01,590
Gradients of agreement ranges from one wholehearted endorsement all the way to eight veto.

475
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:06,429
And what you do is you have a decision on the table.

476
01:06:06,430 --> 01:06:11,260
It might be something like we are going to focus on.

477
01:06:14,710 --> 01:06:19,460
I don't know. Helping all people.

478
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:29,870
In the neighborhood. Uh.

479
01:06:30,830 --> 01:06:34,010
Come to our informational town hall or something like that.

480
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:43,370
Come. Hall by paying them.

481
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:49,860
So that could be like some decision that is on the table.

482
01:06:51,370 --> 01:07:00,760
And so everybody gets a say and it takes a long time. Everybody gets a say, so they get to say where they fall on this from 1 to 8.

483
01:07:05,530 --> 01:07:14,260
Essentially if you have people who are not supporting, that opens it up for discussion automatically.

484
01:07:16,430 --> 01:07:21,240
So if they say. I don't like it, but I will support it.

485
01:07:21,660 --> 01:07:26,970
Then you need to open using this strategy. You're opening up that for conversation again.

486
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:32,190
What don't you like about it? How can we? You know, and it's not about influencing.

487
01:07:32,190 --> 01:07:37,920
It's about finding that ground where everyone can get to endorsement.

488
01:07:40,150 --> 01:07:43,420
So it takes a while. Things change in the process.

489
01:07:43,810 --> 01:07:52,240
But the idea is that as a group, as a collaborative, you're coming to a decision that everyone can support and you can use it in different ways.

490
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:56,290
You might know this in the way that I used it on Saturday.

491
01:07:56,710 --> 01:08:00,820
I gave just to help speed up the conversation because we were running out of time.

492
01:08:03,070 --> 01:08:08,860
I made it into green, yellow, orange, green, yellow and red.

493
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:14,210
So I knew that. And I said and we have a lot of suggestions to work through.

494
01:08:14,220 --> 01:08:25,140
So I said, if you say, Rand, we're going to anybody says we're kicking off the table and then we're going to move to those that got green and orange.

495
01:08:26,140 --> 01:08:36,910
And so we were able to kind of work through options that were green or orange until we got to a set of three of the five strategic priorities.

496
01:08:37,870 --> 01:08:43,650
It can be used also for valuation decisions like who will we sample in a special?

497
01:08:43,660 --> 01:08:50,410
And it's especially important when those decisions can be fraught with potential power.

498
01:08:51,130 --> 01:08:54,490
Power issues. Like sampling.

499
01:08:56,200 --> 01:09:05,710
Sampling beneficiaries that have some financial stake in the program, meaning they get money, they get resources from a program.

500
01:09:06,790 --> 01:09:10,300
Those kinds of decisions are important to bring to a group.

501
01:09:13,830 --> 01:09:23,730
So any questions? And this I think I meant a fistfight which is a similar strategy except we use uses fists to fight.

502
01:09:26,490 --> 01:09:32,500
Any questions about any of these strategies? Yes.

503
01:09:40,270 --> 01:09:44,170
You. And.

504
01:09:45,700 --> 01:09:57,010
Why? Yeah.

505
01:09:57,130 --> 01:10:03,370
Yeah, that's. That's spot on. So sometimes. So you can and you can adjust it.

506
01:10:03,370 --> 01:10:12,790
Yeah, I should say that, you know, so in, in this example, like what if everybody says read you can, you can use that for discussion.

507
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:19,690
That's for discussion. Okay, so everyone's unread. Why like what can we talk about the concerns on the table?

508
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:23,709
Ideally, you know,

509
01:10:23,710 --> 01:10:30,790
everybody's going to be read if everybody's read for everything that tells you that you're probably taking up too much space in the decision making,

510
01:10:31,330 --> 01:10:38,230
in the planning. But yes, you can like it, you know, adjust as needed.

511
01:10:39,530 --> 01:10:45,430
Good question. Any other questions about or any of the strategies?

512
01:10:49,950 --> 01:10:54,520
Right. So. I saw them.

513
01:10:54,930 --> 01:10:58,980
I bet you thought you were going to come in this class. We're just gonna learn how to analyze data.

514
01:10:59,490 --> 01:11:03,720
You will. But we don't just analyze data.

515
01:11:03,990 --> 01:11:07,620
We operate. I can't say it enough. We operate in political environments.

516
01:11:07,860 --> 01:11:16,889
So if you do an evaluation with a field placement or you have an internship during the summer and they

517
01:11:16,890 --> 01:11:21,270
force you to do an evaluation because you go to the University of Michigan School of Public Health,

518
01:11:23,550 --> 01:11:30,270
just know there is a political environment. And instinctually, you know, we most of most of us know that.

519
01:11:30,270 --> 01:11:36,120
But managing that is important and knowing how to manage that strategically is even

520
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:41,159
more important because there are some keys to success in evaluation projects.

521
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:46,410
I've been doing this for a really long time. There's lots of ways that evaluations can fail.

522
01:11:46,620 --> 01:11:51,560
Mismatch between evaluators. Medical researchers again.

523
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:57,280
There could be situations where nobody.

524
01:11:57,940 --> 01:12:05,770
The only reason anybody's even doing the evaluation is because the CDC said we need this data so no one cares about the data.

525
01:12:06,130 --> 01:12:11,950
To me, that is not a successful project as well. So keys to success,

526
01:12:12,430 --> 01:12:22,090
buy in to the process and to other parties at the table because you're going to walk away and whatever is determined needs to be implemented.

527
01:12:22,720 --> 01:12:26,030
People don't get along. Guess what's not happening.

528
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:33,450
It's important to have transparency or candor. Can't candor.

529
01:12:33,900 --> 01:12:42,000
You know, people need to be willing to to share their perspective, even if it disagrees with what somebody else is saying.

530
01:12:42,540 --> 01:12:53,900
Comment perspective. So again, coming to the same values, the same pieces of information that will be shared, the same use, etc., etc.

531
01:12:56,350 --> 01:13:03,940
You know, another key for success is that there is a desire for joint action among the invested parties or stakeholders.

532
01:13:05,020 --> 01:13:09,700
So because collecting data and analyzing it can get boring.

533
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:18,920
And so you want people to be driven by that desire for action in the community or in the interest of our society.

534
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:24,410
Interest is sustainability. This is how I know I meet water when I start stumbling.

535
01:13:29,610 --> 01:13:40,710
I get thirsty, interested in sustainability, of evaluation, youth, and then just learning, learning and being responsive to what you are learning.

536
01:13:42,550 --> 01:13:47,200
So these strategies help us do that. And again, they take time.

537
01:13:47,710 --> 01:13:51,970
Time equals money. But the money is well invested.

538
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:56,500
If it gets you to a valuations that can be used.

539
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:03,600
Okay. So I just have one more question and we have a few more minutes left.

540
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:09,900
And I want to ask you a question. So these strategies are not appropriate for all situations.

541
01:14:10,730 --> 01:14:15,440
So in what situations might you not want to use engagement strategies?

542
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:18,960
And so I mentioned one. Cultural.

543
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:34,610
Incompatibility. What might be some other reasons why you don't want to use these engagement strategies.

544
01:14:42,240 --> 01:15:07,030
Oh. Yeah.

545
01:15:07,390 --> 01:15:10,870
So the size of the group matters. If it's. If it's really small.

546
01:15:11,020 --> 01:15:15,280
And sometimes it is. Even if, you know, you're engaging people.

547
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:23,290
It might be a little excessive. You know you.

548
01:15:26,100 --> 01:15:29,440
Whew. Woo! That's a good one.

549
01:15:29,770 --> 01:15:32,800
And that is sometimes unfortunately true.

550
01:15:34,630 --> 01:15:41,420
Women, you know? You won't be able to use their feedback.

551
01:15:42,850 --> 01:15:46,630
I would expand that to say, I mean, it doesn't have to be just community.

552
01:15:48,830 --> 01:15:52,430
Be able to use feedback.

553
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:57,940
It could be. You know,

554
01:15:57,940 --> 01:16:02,979
let's be real could be staff that you're working with and you know that their

555
01:16:02,980 --> 01:16:09,130
supervisors or directors already have something that set in stone y you know,

556
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:12,220
so sometimes it's not wise to open the Pandora's box.

557
01:16:27,810 --> 01:16:43,670
No. So privacy concerns, maybe having people together if especially if you're working with vulnerable populations.

558
01:16:45,710 --> 01:16:55,490
Might be an issue, psychological safety. So sometimes and we see this again thinking about vulnerable populations where.

559
01:16:56,750 --> 01:17:07,880
There might need to be some work done before engagement so that you're not basically creating a situation where people are being triggered.

560
01:17:10,430 --> 01:17:13,880
You know, just spitballing the example that I'm making up.

561
01:17:14,270 --> 01:17:26,480
I can see, for example, if you're doing some evaluation of intimate partner violence programs, you don't want to bring survivors together with,

562
01:17:27,260 --> 01:17:35,540
but the with people who are, you know, the people that assaulted them or just people who are on the other side.

563
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:59,960
That's an example of psychological safety. Yeah.

564
01:17:59,970 --> 01:18:05,730
So you might have situations where you really just don't have the ability to compensate people who.

565
01:18:06,840 --> 01:18:11,970
Don't receive like work compensation for coming which can lead to.

566
01:18:14,810 --> 01:18:23,810
Problems of representation. Tayshia or.

567
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:30,710
Power imbalances. And then another one.

568
01:18:31,340 --> 01:18:35,390
It's time I was about I was about to do this, but you all came up with much better ones.

569
01:18:35,690 --> 01:18:40,210
Hi. Maybe you only got two months to do the evaluation.

570
01:18:42,290 --> 01:18:48,380
She ain't got no time for, you know, you just don't have time for this. And so sometimes that is the case.

571
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:53,570
So it's important. Just assess different reasons why you might or might not use these.

572
01:18:55,140 --> 01:19:00,810
And unlike when I usually write on the screen, I will save this and upload it.

573
01:19:01,230 --> 01:19:05,570
So you will have it. So thank you.

574
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:14,540
So I'll just you know, I just want to remind you again, Simon's due on the 28th at 11:59 p.m.

575
01:19:17,650 --> 01:19:21,310
You know, that's the only reason I want to put it there. Just just a reminder.

576
01:19:21,820 --> 01:19:32,800
All right, so have a good day. But I don't.

577
01:19:48,660 --> 01:19:49,030
Yeah.
