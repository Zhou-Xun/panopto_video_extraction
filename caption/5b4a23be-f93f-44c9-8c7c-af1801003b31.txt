1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:05,100
Do you know that people in the city want to do something?

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:09,530
You know, that's that's not very far.

3
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:13,060
So how are you doing today? Yeah, I'm excited.

4
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:21,270
You're doing pretty good. I'm very excited today to welcome Dr. Robertson coming from all the way from Baltimore,

5
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:28,860
which we both realize is actually a lot faster flight than you might think to get to D.W. But this was serendipitous for for me and for us.

6
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:34,500
I believe Dr. Brunson is here as part of our to participate in a policy panel for the Ford School.

7
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:40,920
I was very kind to come and share some of his work and experience around community police interactions.

8
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,610
And so when we think about different forms of injury, we think about some of those broader influences.

9
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,360
I know folks in this class like to think from a multi-level perspective.

10
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,890
What are some of the contextual features beyond an individual who might be injured

11
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:56,640
and what role do some of the structures that are in place in this country,

12
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,940
for example, police, neighborhoods, all these different facets that might be coming in and playing a part in injury.

13
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:09,569
And this is one example. So I'm delighted to have Dr. Brunson here today, and we're going to have a perhaps a free form discussion.

14
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:15,719
I can leave this up if folks like to see the picture of the man, everybody talking in front of you.

15
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,020
But Dr. Brunson, please take it away. Thank you so much for for joining us.

16
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,220
Thank you. I'm first delighted that I didn't wear the same outfit.

17
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:29,819
And the other thing and by way of introduction, I'm glad you are a talkative bunch,

18
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:35,040
because I like to hear from you as much as as I will provide you with some comments.

19
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,450
I think it's also important to kind of lay the ground work,

20
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:44,370
to let you know that if I could be anything else other than an academic, I would be a stand up comedian.

21
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:51,270
And you all will soon find out why I'm not a stand up comedian, but it doesn't stop me from trying to kind of give out that dream.

22
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:59,970
So I don't know if you all had the opportunity to read the reading that the assignment that I pass along to publication.

23
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,860
But I want to give you some background to how I got involved in doing the type of work that I do.

24
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,990
And so it goes back to my graduate student days, as you well know here.

25
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:19,530
And I was on the south side of Chicago and I went to Chicago and on purpose as it relates to my graduate study,

26
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:29,009
because I was interested in juvenile delinquency and gang involvement. And so at the time this was in the late 1990 and early 2000, you know,

27
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:33,990
Chicago was a place and still is a place that has considerable gang presence and,

28
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:38,549
you know, a history, a long history of gang involvement in particular types of communities.

29
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:45,810
So, you know, only criminologist would gravitate to such places everyone else is trying to, you know, avoid.

30
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,639
So, yeah, that's what I want to do.

31
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:53,370
And I want to go on to South Side of Chicago and I want to talk to young people about their experiences with gangs.

32
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,810
And so I got introduced. I'm going to try to make the short list, the short version.

33
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:02,760
So I got to introduce it to people, some people in the community, you know, of course, which they should have.

34
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,329
They vetted me. So it was a long time before I actually talked to someone.

35
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:14,069
I did things like volunteering at a community center and help with fundraisers and basketball games on the weekends.

36
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:17,399
You know, I helped mop floors and put on tables, etc., etc.,

37
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:22,140
just to kind of show that I'm not just here to extract information that I actually want to,

38
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:26,970
you know, in my small way, make a difference in the health of the community.

39
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:32,070
So when I fast forward, when I finally got permission to talk to kids,

40
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:39,300
I was doing a series of one on one interviews is what I typically do is to talk to people, to kind of capture the lived experiences.

41
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:45,540
So the young people that were before me in this room and at the time tells you about inflation,

42
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:51,420
although I think today would simply be this would be an attractive incentive for a study with young people.

43
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:59,730
And again, I was a graduate student, so I didn't have a lot of funds, so I had to kind of fund the study on my own, if I can recall.

44
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:05,850
And so each participant, I gave them $5 coupon book of McDonald's gift certificates,

45
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:10,139
you know, so $5, you know, and particularly McDonald's that was a big seller.

46
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:13,260
So I started doing interviews, talking young people.

47
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:19,590
And I had this checklist that I had this preconceived notion of gang membership and how do people identify,

48
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,740
how do people select and, you know, participation in gangs.

49
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:31,260
And I go down this little survey that I had and asked what I thought were all these ingenious questions around activities that,

50
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,009
you know, most of the literature supports, that this is what gang members do.

51
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:40,620
They identify by color. They have a group of friends that, you know, are unique.

52
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:44,100
They engage in certain types of delinquent activities, etc., etc.

53
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:49,320
And I got to the final question and it said, so would you consider your group of friends again?

54
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:53,100
And the first probably ten people said no.

55
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:59,760
And I'm like, you know, I'm thinking like, no, you said all these other things that you have to be in the game and, you know, so this was like an.

56
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:04,690
Big fail. But I continued, you know, continuing I only have so many $5 gift certificates.

57
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:12,670
So I continued on and the next group of people came in and this one young person I got all the way down the list,

58
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:18,190
answered all the other questions, they fit the criteria. And I got to the question about, so are you in a gang?

59
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:21,249
And I'm waiting to hear this other kind of defeating?

60
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:24,460
No. And the person said they did say no.

61
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:30,459
And before I went on, I was like, but I am going to click and I'm like, I've been asking the wrong question, you know?

62
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:37,150
So I had this preconceived notion that kids referred to themselves as in ways that the literature refers to them,

63
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:41,320
but not necessarily how they refer to each other and how they see themselves.

64
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:50,260
So they may resemble gang members and all these other types of ways, but in terms of what they identify themselves is doesn't fit with the literature.

65
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,520
So there's a problem here.

66
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:57,340
And the problem that I was contributing to, because I had these preconceived notions that the literature was correct, right?

67
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,430
So that was one illuminating moment.

68
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:07,600
And the second and these are things that have continued to impact me as I continue to do my work, because not to go into situations,

69
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:14,290
I try not to go into situations thinking that I already know the answer or thinking that I already know how people identify themselves,

70
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:19,300
thinking that I already know the struggles and how they navigate difficult situations.

71
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:28,000
So the second illuminating moment was this young person I was asking questions about when you get past the game collecting, I got that figured out.

72
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,590
So I go back now and I had the wisdom of asking, where do you call yourself, etc.?

73
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:37,240
And the conversation we're having were How do you make how do you stay safe?

74
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:45,160
So this is a gang involved neighborhood. There been a lot of violence, a lot of shootings, a lot of other types of assaults.

75
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,110
How do you navigate this space as a young person, 14, 15 years old?

76
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:55,470
And one young person said to me, well, you know, the game is on a problem because, you know, we go to school with them.

77
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:59,560
They're our family members, their cousins, etc., you know, our neighbors.

78
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:06,459
And the person looked at me very somberly, this was like after the interview they had to talk to me kind of a debrief,

79
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:12,400
and they said, Can you do something about the police? And I'm like, What do you mean do by the police?

80
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:21,309
They were like, the police. Basically, to paraphrase the police in in young people's mind, was a bigger safety issue than the gangs, you know.

81
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:26,710
So we're focusing on community violence and thinking about the harms that young people do to one another.

82
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:35,110
But not having like I didn't think about even though I wasn't naive about the tensions between police in particular communities of color.

83
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:42,019
And this was a predominately black community on the south side of Chicago, but I didn't think about the police in particular,

84
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:48,490
these young people presenting the same types of safety challenges that the gangs presented for them.

85
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,900
So that kind of fast forward to the work that I do, again, not go into communities thinking I know the answer,

86
00:07:55,300 --> 00:08:01,540
spending some time talking to people before I even start asking questions to make sure that I at least

87
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:07,660
have a sense of what I want to know and not to have this kind of predetermined checklist that guides me,

88
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:11,470
etc. So that's how I came here.

89
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:18,490
So I've done a lot of work in different types of communities with young people and their experiences with the police,

90
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:24,850
but also how to reduce violence and particularly firearm violence in communities.

91
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:28,239
In the article that you are well at least exposed to,

92
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:33,940
and I know if you read it or not I won't ask for a show of hands was about you know help me find solutions.

93
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:40,030
And so the article that you read was from the ten point coalition effort in Boston,

94
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:45,460
where police and clergy got together and engaged in the intervention to reduce gun violence.

95
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:51,159
And it's all based on this overarching kind of theme, I think, through my work.

96
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,240
And what I try to demonstrate is that, you know,

97
00:08:54,250 --> 00:09:02,770
building trust and legitimacy is important to reducing violence and particularly firearm injury and gun violence.

98
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:12,190
So that's why and that's why I'm here. And I'd like to hear from you either about the article or just in general.

99
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:19,000
Yes. Do you have a letter written in the prevention department come to work alongside with you?

100
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:26,680
I think the closest that I have come over the years are in different cities violence interrupters.

101
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:31,990
So people who have been involved in criminal justice system by virtue of their

102
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:38,530
participation as victims and perpetrators of violence and gun violence to work together.

103
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:47,440
And again, that comes back to trust. I think that you really don't have access to populations unless you have the trust of the gatekeepers.

104
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:54,370
And those have been important gatekeepers for me. And one study in New York City that I led with a group of graduate students,

105
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:59,650
we didn't design it this way, but, you know, as luck or bad luck would have it.

106
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:05,480
In the beginning, we had all these delays in actually doing the study, you know,

107
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:13,379
actually have an opportunity to go out into the communities and interact with young people and to help bring their voices to the research.

108
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:16,380
And they're sharing their lived experiences to the research.

109
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:24,570
So because we had all these delays, the young graduate students, they said, well, we're just going to hang out with the violence interrupters.

110
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:28,440
And, you know, and they ended up hanging out with them. They didn't know before a year.

111
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:36,270
So a year before we could even ask anybody questions. And I think that actually helped us tremendously because they were known in the communities.

112
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:42,780
They had the trust of the violence interrupters. They participated in things like resume writing workshops.

113
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:50,250
They went on field trips with the young people who are being served by some of the different local grassroots organizations.

114
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:58,440
So again, they were able to build trust. And so when it came to time, we start asking questions and we were asking questions about gun possession,

115
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:02,670
participation in the underground illegal gun market, you know,

116
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:07,860
sensitive questions that just coming in and being dropped from the university into the neighborhood,

117
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:11,910
you know, people would be like, you know, who are you and why are you asking me these questions?

118
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:17,909
And because they had the opportunity and the wisdom to build that trust and those relationships,

119
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:24,840
not only with the violence interrupters who extended whatever trust they had from people, you know, they would come to people and say, hey, he's okay.

120
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,910
And I've actually had injuries in the side.

121
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:31,559
I've been interviewing people and they were like, you know, I asked them to get to the point when they asked,

122
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:35,970
you know, some sensitive questions about their involvement in various types of criminal behavior.

123
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:40,620
And it was said, can we stop for a minute? And they go outside and talk to someone.

124
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:45,720
And the person thankfully, hopefully told you he's okay. And they come back and then they answer the question.

125
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:51,540
So that's my long winded answer to say in some instances, yes.

126
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:58,270
Yes. So I was wondering, what's your word for stun gun violence?

127
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:03,820
Have you talked with, like officers about like the blue wall of silence?

128
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:16,180
Because, like, there's my dad used to be up and he left because he felt like some people would take stuff home from scenes and he would,

129
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:20,709
like, tell on them. I was like, hey, this is not this is a good point.

130
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:24,820
Either way, it's not supposed to be used. And he was like, You don't have to be here.

131
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:33,370
Mm hmm. Um, and so, like, I think, like that, like there's, like, this, like, sense of camaraderie between officers.

132
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:39,300
Like, well, nobody will tell on each other if you do something that is still against the law.

133
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:48,760
Because it's just impossible. Because when you work as a professional, I mean, certainly I've done work and I've been fortunate to you know,

134
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:55,360
I've been very careful, hopefully not to just be isolated, to being labeled as a police researcher.

135
00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:03,160
But I also try to make sure that there is a balance in terms of, you know, there's a lot of research on police officers,

136
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:09,070
perceptions of citizen's demeanor, but not a lot of work on police officer demeanor that can also impact that.

137
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:14,770
So in terms of certainly, you know, the blue wall of silence and police officers, you know,

138
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:20,730
reluctance to come forward and point out wrongdoing and having this culture of

139
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:26,290
potentially leading to a culture of misconduct and how those things kind of,

140
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:30,430
you know, contribute to tensions between police and community.

141
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:34,990
I think one of the things important about what you said, particularly about your father's experience,

142
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:40,480
is that now we have several states and other entities talking about the duty to intervene.

143
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:44,500
Right. And so that you have this you're mandated and it's not.

144
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:50,350
You would think that there would be a mandate because you take the oath and then you are in a position of authority.

145
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:55,000
Then you would come forward and that your complaints would be taken seriously.

146
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:01,479
But now several departments have instituted that it is an obligation that other officers had to come forward.

147
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:09,100
So. And so I agree with you. I think one of the leading kind of challenges, or at least prominent challenge to police reform,

148
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:13,600
however, we think about reform, you know, are the police unions themselves.

149
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:19,030
And that leads to a whole host of difficulties and controversies.

150
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:28,700
You. Yes. How how do you identify within the community, the leadership in 2012 before you can actually start talking?

151
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:30,690
Yeah. I mean,

152
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:39,889
that is a it certainly is difficult because sometimes people who think they're leaders are not leaders and the community may not see them as leaders.

153
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:48,170
And the people that I'm always very, I guess, suspicious when particularly going back to police organizations,

154
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:54,350
when they bring in people from the community, I'm like, I don't know if I want them because those may not be those are the people that you like,

155
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:59,270
you know, those are the people that you found to be more, I guess,

156
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:07,909
less difficult to work with than maybe some other people who are holding your feet to the fire, who hold you accountable for past harms and abuses.

157
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:13,960
And you don't want to work with them. But those are the people who, you know, I may have a different we talk about methodologies.

158
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:17,780
The samples may be starkly different if I went with the people who you bring me,

159
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:22,459
as opposed to if I went into the community and spent time in barber shops or just spent

160
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:26,780
time on the block and learning who are the leaders that I you may not be the leaders that,

161
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,919
you know, city councilman or the mayor may be comfortable working with.

162
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:37,160
But these are the people who have the ear of people who are disproportionately involved in in violence.

163
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:46,190
So you just reminded me of another story that I had from my graduate school days, and that is when I originally started trying to design the study.

164
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:50,659
People actually said, Well, why don't you go to the police, uh, figure out what the common thing was.

165
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:57,260
CAFS community something policing meetings that they have like once a month in different neighborhoods.

166
00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:04,790
And I went to a couple of them and not to be disparaging about, you know, elderly people in the church basement,

167
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:11,230
but those weren't the people to me that could impact violence in the way that I was interested in the impact of violence.

168
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,960
And these are the people who usually call the police, not the police.

169
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:21,829
I want to speak to the people who had the police called on them. So I think it has a lot of there are a lot of implications for what your sample,

170
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:26,480
how you get your sample, you know, who are your kind of connectors to the community.

171
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:33,830
And those are decisions sometimes I think we make hastily and out of convenience as opposed to thinking about who are the real,

172
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:38,450
quote unquote leaders, as you point out. And there could be differences in those groups.

173
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:44,540
So even with the clergy in Boston, there were a number of the clergy who said to me, you know, I don't like the police.

174
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:50,959
You know, I don't want to work with the police. But thankfully, we have people in this group that do have those relationships.

175
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,180
So if I need something done, I can go to them.

176
00:16:53,180 --> 00:17:01,790
But I don't want to work with the police myself because the people are responsible to the community, don't have a favorable opinion of the police.

177
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:05,840
So I lose street cred if I'm seen as working with the police.

178
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:14,060
So it's very complicated. I know that wasn't exactly an answer. It's probably a long winded answer, but but it is a complicated you know,

179
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:19,520
it's is equally art and science, figuring out if you're actually speaking with the right people.

180
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:25,710
Yeah, great questions. I'm sorry.

181
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:30,870
I'll get you. I'll get you in there. When it came to getting community fired.

182
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:35,760
Did you find yourself relying more on academia skills or street skills?

183
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:48,459
I would say a mix because people are you know, and I think this is the this is, I think, an unfortunate bias that sometimes that even academics have.

184
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:55,480
I think that when you they believe sometimes because of the mix of identities that you have as a researcher and a scholar,

185
00:17:55,870 --> 00:18:01,150
that it's easy for you to navigate certain communities when the reality of it is they,

186
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:05,290
you know, depend on the community and their their history with institutions.

187
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:12,940
They might be more distrusting of you because they might see you as a sellout or like you're here undercover or whatever, you know.

188
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:16,650
So I think it's it's challenging, you know, in those ways as well.

189
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:20,530
I think the only thing you really have to rely on that I was say to myself,

190
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:25,690
in most cases I'm successful, that I can't say that I'm everyone's cup of tea.

191
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:31,240
I can go anywhere and talk to anybody. But I like to think that by spending more time with people, I can win them over.

192
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:35,410
But some people are just resistant. I've had those where people just don't want to work with you.

193
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:41,020
They're suspicious of you. You're never going to win them over and you have to kind of go in a different direction.

194
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:48,219
So I always say cruelty to my students is a you are the instrument and everybody's not a good, you know, interviewer.

195
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:51,250
Everybody's not a good ethnographer. Everybody's not a good researcher.

196
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:54,730
But the skills that you have hopefully can translate.

197
00:18:55,630 --> 00:19:03,910
And I think the thing, again, I would say that I believe benefited me is that, you know, I grew up in communities similar to the ones that I study.

198
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:07,749
So I wasn't necessarily, I guess, put off.

199
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:16,030
And I try not to ask offensive questions, you know, but I but I also it caused you to kind of reflect on yourself and think about that.

200
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:23,229
You know, I am in a very privileged position today. So even if I grew up, you know, in similar circumstances,

201
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:28,150
as many of the young people that are involved in my work today, they don't see me as one of them.

202
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:35,799
You know, I'm not one of them anymore. And so I don't try to connect with them in that way because that's inauthentic as well.

203
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:41,440
And people take offense, which they should add to that. So did you have a follow up or did I ask you.

204
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:44,799
Good, good. Yes. Yeah.

205
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:52,629
I'm just going to say, to understand that life is more so like a domino effect, select deal or no deal at the chain of communication.

206
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:58,470
So I feel a little bit about just this individual like me, and they have that connection with the process essentially.

207
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:05,200
So do you see that that also works rather than trying to get them to build a relationship with the photos or just kind of like what would

208
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:14,229
that chain and I'm going to give you credit for reading the article and don't say yes or no so that they and what the one the interesting

209
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:20,889
way I think is one of the more interesting finding is that we found that it didn't you didn't necessarily everyone didn't have to have

210
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:27,850
good relationships with one another like all those relationships didn't have to permeate the institution that it mattered like this.

211
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:33,220
The example I gave you before that at someone in the institution, whether it be a police officer,

212
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:37,320
we had really good relationships in the community who other police officers may not have had.

213
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:41,920
They can go to that person and they could broker that trust for them or in the other direction.

214
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:46,240
So it doesn't have to the said trust doesn't have to permeate the institutions,

215
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:51,310
but there need to be key people in those institutions that can you know,

216
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:57,710
they have the ability to kind of go out and speak on behalf of other people who may not have those kinds of relationships.

217
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:06,580
So it is a very kind of one, one on one interpersonal kind of relationship that those things are built on.

218
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:12,610
But the danger of that is that when those people leave, you know, then who replaces them, if anyone.

219
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:19,630
And so if it's only built on, we have strong police community relations because we have five really good police officers who

220
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:25,809
are trusted in the community and then those five people retired and we haven't replaced them,

221
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:29,780
you know, then what happens, right? Yes, sir.

222
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:36,680
How do you maintain the relationships after you've collected the information and made it actually strive to do that?

223
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:42,020
I mean, that's a great question. And I mean, it really calls for and I'm going to be as honest as I can.

224
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:44,060
It calls for, you know, sincerity.

225
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:50,570
So, you know, what I try to do is I go in, you know, not to be that person who just comes and takes information and then leaves.

226
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:59,930
So I try to maintain relationships. I try to figure out ways that I can either involve people in my ongoing research or provide them with,

227
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:04,730
you know, in addition to the incentives that I give them for participating,

228
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:11,720
you know, maybe that I have another research project that they will be instrumental in helping me with or involving them,

229
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:17,780
you know, not that they necessarily always are interested in publication opportunities, you know, or maybe,

230
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:24,169
you know, they have questions about going to school, you know, enrolling in college and things of that nature.

231
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:31,579
So just to not to just disappear, I guess, to, to to simplify it, I try not to disappear once I get but I need,

232
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:36,440
you know, that I try to maintain those relationships to the best of my abilities.

233
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:42,290
And when people call me and ask for something, I try to figure out a way to either if I can provide it,

234
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:46,940
connect them with someone else just to honor that commitment that I that I made to them.

235
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:53,749
But researchers, as you probably know, have a bad reputation in some communities,

236
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:59,659
and sometimes it's very well deserved because we go in, we extract information and we go on.

237
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:04,790
And as I've said several times, you know, young people said to me and I'm like,

238
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:08,870
I'm not writing the book after you write your book or you're going to make forget about us.

239
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,990
I'm like, Well, first of all, I write the book.

240
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:18,569
And but it really, you know, but it kind of, you know, struck me as people have made them promises and they haven't made good on those promises.

241
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:26,360
So now they're reluctant to share the intimate details of their lives in which we're asking them to do their harms, their trauma, etc.

242
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:30,860
And then we just go off and we advance our own careers and we don't believe that

243
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:35,149
we have a responsibility to give back in whatever ways that looks like for us,

244
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:41,600
where there's things so small as, you know, being a job reference or somebody, you know, things like excuse me,

245
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:45,620
things like that, you know, you don't have to go back and build them a playground or anything,

246
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:50,809
but at least have some sense of a responsibility and an obligation that people have shared

247
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:56,180
with you things that they didn't have to share because you don't have your hand everywhere.

248
00:23:56,230 --> 00:24:05,330
And when you're talking about giving back or also thinking about the deed of sharing and how that was going back to our communities.

249
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:09,200
And I was just wondering, since you work specifically with youth a lot,

250
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:17,750
how do you look at involving youth in that in the data sharing and like the data interpretation portion of the work that you do?

251
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:21,589
Yeah, those I mean those are very complicated.

252
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:24,710
So I'm thinking about in terms of the sharing.

253
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:29,870
And so what I attempt to do is also to protect young people from themselves because,

254
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:32,870
you know, sometimes they don't know they're naive to some of these processes.

255
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:37,969
So I don't want to share transcripts where people have said something about someone else or said something

256
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:43,280
that might put them at harm or say something that is very unique to them and they may identify them.

257
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:47,659
And one of the ways I've tried to do that, so I'll answer the question before I go on.

258
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:53,360
So I try to do is to go back and depend on the community setting, if not the people,

259
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:57,050
the participants themselves, but certainly the violence interrupters.

260
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:04,849
And here are my preliminary findings like here are two things that I think that I'm seeing and have an opportunity for them to weigh in and say,

261
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:10,790
what did you think that this could be the interpretation or did you consider these things even before it gets to that,

262
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:14,900
involving people who know a lot more than I do do people who are on the street?

263
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:18,890
Are these experiences in the design of the study and the questions?

264
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:23,300
You know, because again, something I learned from the hard lesson that I learned as a graduate student,

265
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,020
that I went in with these questions that I probably got from some other professor

266
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:31,160
or some other graduate student or somebody some scale that was published,

267
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:40,430
you know, previously. And I thought that was the way to go, as opposed to now having the wisdom to go and ask people who are on the ground

268
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:44,210
and know what's going on today as opposed to those things may have been true.

269
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:48,150
Those surveys may have been instrumental 20 years ago, but, you know,

270
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:51,440
things have changed or they may have been instrumental if I was doing a study in Detroit,

271
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:56,030
but they may not be relevant in Chicago, they may not be relevant in Baltimore, etc.

272
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:04,760
So I try to involve them, but I try to bar them in a way that is responsible and to also, you know, I think it's great to get there.

273
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:09,319
Meaning, like when someone said this, you know, our interpretation is this.

274
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:13,760
And someone who has intimate knowledge would say, well, that's probably not what they meant.

275
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:20,690
They may have been referring to this or they may have been, you know, communicating something different than what your interpretation would be.

276
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:26,600
I think one of the other things that I attempted to do, and this is I think is paramount in this type of work.

277
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:36,560
And I didn't know. This was a concern that I had to have that good fortune graduate school that I had professors who were working with,

278
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:43,040
I would say criminal justice system devolved individuals and they would speak to

279
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:49,160
me about the importance of protecting the data and protecting your subjects from,

280
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:54,799
you know, subpoena or from, you know, if law enforcement came to you and ask you questions, etc.

281
00:26:54,800 --> 00:27:00,170
And so one of the things that I attempt to do and not to, you know, to be to obstruct justice or anything,

282
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:06,050
but one of the things I do to protect myself is that I don't know the names of people that I interview.

283
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:10,730
And I always say to them, Don't tell me your name. And if I do know your name, I'm not going to use it.

284
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:13,700
And any kind of identifying, you know,

285
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:19,850
like human subject forms or whatever else that they had to even for payment if they have the documentation from the university,

286
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:25,399
I said, just make up a name or write it down. We're going to keep you've written down Mickey Mouse or whatever, just, you know,

287
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:33,139
to put something there so I can show that I paid someone in that for my protection and for their protection, because I would often say to people,

288
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:37,340
they would ask me, are you concerned that, you know,

289
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:47,240
law enforcement may read some of your work and seek to kind of seek revenge or retribution

290
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:51,629
against the people who have disclosed things to you about their experiences with police.

291
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:57,860
So a lot of the work that I've done, people talk about particular police officers and what they've done to them in terms of,

292
00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:02,720
you know, falsifying evidence, testimony, etc.

293
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:09,920
And what I always say is that I could, even if I were subpoenaed, I couldn't help whomever find these people cause I don't know who they are.

294
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,900
Like, I legitimately don't know who they are.

295
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:19,190
And so that's, you know, it's kind of a, you know, a maybe a kind of a sleight of hand, but it's the truth.

296
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:24,889
And so it protects me, protects them and allows them hopefully to speak with me freely,

297
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:28,580
knowing that, you know, I could, you know, find them again if I wanted to.

298
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:40,340
Yes. Oh, I feel that you are at first in terms of how you approach conversations as involved, especially in relation to any kind of.

299
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:46,560
Taking. I told you I was very. Mhm.

300
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:53,069
And you know, and it's interesting sense that there were some career defining moments I think that

301
00:28:53,070 --> 00:29:00,780
I've had around issues of race and issues of police treatment of young black men,

302
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,790
of color, and that's how I started.

303
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:13,250
So one of the first papers that I sought to write was published in 2007, and the title is and it's probably my most cited work.

304
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:17,639
The title is Police Don't Like Black People, so play on the kind of Kanye West.

305
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:21,810
And then there's something after the semi-colon that's more academic than that.

306
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:30,810
And when I originally sent the paper out for peer review and I was a new assistant professor and the reviews that I got back from the editor,

307
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:32,160
they were harsh.

308
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:41,250
You know, these are otherwise, you know, you think open minded, you know, progressive intellectuals and some of the comments they gave,

309
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:46,830
particularly they didn't like the fact I think they didn't like the fact that it was qualitative work.

310
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:52,410
I didn't they didn't have an appreciation for that and some of the comments and I still had the rejection letter.

311
00:29:52,770 --> 00:30:02,580
And I remember to this day in the reviews, I kept them for a reason and said, you know, why are you believing criminals over police officers?

312
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:06,870
And to this is journalism. It's not science.

313
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:14,940
And the third thing that they said was and of young people who are having bad relationships with the police, it's because they're criminals.

314
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:19,200
And so I misspoke. That wasn't the police don't like black people that was betraying peace.

315
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:25,920
And so we got those comments back. We, you know, lift our wounds, took the paper.

316
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:31,499
I don't think we changed much of anything and sent it to the British Journal of Criminology and they got published.

317
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:38,430
Accept it right away so that, you know, again, people will try to you know, there are gatekeepers and,

318
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:43,259
you know, the information that you have access to is kind of the selection bias, right?

319
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:51,030
It's what managed to make it through the peer review process. So when I speak about the what I was trying to write stories got confused about the

320
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:56,040
police don't like black people paper is one of the editors challenged me to push.

321
00:30:56,050 --> 00:31:03,360
I think I had some kind of academic side and title and the editor at the time pushed me and said, You need to be a little bit more provocative.

322
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:09,690
Like given what's in this paper, you can't be this thorough, you know, kind of academic title.

323
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:15,270
And when I got the comments back and I went to make the revisions and one of

324
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:19,320
the senior colleagues at the time I went to them and I was somewhat defeated.

325
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:23,220
This is back. I'm back to doing the paper again. I jump around.

326
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:28,200
So I was somewhat defeated by having these and I was like, I don't know if I want to pursue this, like, you know?

327
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:33,960
And I said, I don't know what that means for my career. Like, if I pursue this and I publish this paper, what is that going to mean?

328
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:38,819
And and I and I credit this person because they looked at me very stern.

329
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:43,440
They said, Well, are you going to have a career worth having if you don't do things that are important to you?

330
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:46,340
And so, yeah, I rolled the dice and did it.

331
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:53,100
It served me well, you know, was provocative, particularly that you think at the time this was only like in 2006.

332
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:57,800
So I say all that to say when people and again, people before me,

333
00:31:57,830 --> 00:32:04,740
lots of people before me had written about police abuses and I not and I'm the first person to do it that I've done it the best.

334
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:13,410
But so when things you know, so we fast forward to Michael Brown in 2014 and then we, you know, all of the ones in between and then George Floyd.

335
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:17,370
And often people say to me, well, do you you know, are you surprised?

336
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:26,150
I'm like, I'm not surprised. And it's unfortunate that, you know, even people before me when I was writing about this, nobody believed me.

337
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:32,040
You know, they didn't they didn't believe not necessarily me, but they didn't believe the young people who I was trying to empower.

338
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:36,210
They didn't believe that these things could could happen to them or that were happening to them.

339
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,230
And I tried to make sense of it by saying, well, you know, if people if you think about it,

340
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:44,430
if you live and we live in a civil society, these things aren't supposed to happen to people.

341
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:49,290
So if your frame of reference is this doesn't happen, as it happened to me, as it happened to my friends,

342
00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:53,850
it wouldn't happen in my neighborhood then it's hard for you to think that could happen to other people.

343
00:32:54,210 --> 00:33:00,810
So I've kind of taken it. So I'm not surprised about the Black Lives Matter movement.

344
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:06,960
I guess what I'm surprised is kind of like I'm my kind of, I guess retort would be, What took you so long?

345
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:11,370
I went to people so long to recognize that this was a problem.

346
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:14,639
And it wasn't that, you know, we can't rely on the academic literature.

347
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,510
People have been saying this for years and we think about social media.

348
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:21,780
So I certainly think that it's long overdue.

349
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:28,830
Whether or not I think that we're going to have meaningful police reform is another that's another matter, you know.

350
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:35,210
I'm sorry. I've been ignoring you. Did you want to ask a question? No, I beg you.

351
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:40,160
Is that a special seat or. This is really nice. He's been moved around sometimes.

352
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:45,270
Oh, so this is your seat in protest? Yeah. Good.

353
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:53,959
So I had two questions. First, are able to find a favor to come up, and it says, like, specifically,

354
00:33:53,960 --> 00:34:01,990
official police patrols historically been used to enforce our laws or whatever and then restricting black citizens movements.

355
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:06,620
And I was wondering, how do you define unofficial police patrols?

356
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:11,180
Is that like citizens who take it upon themselves to act?

357
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:15,830
Is it like neighborhood watch? I think I was talking about.

358
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:18,930
Is that from the paper itself? Yeah. This is from full, like.

359
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:22,340
What's that? What's the academic sounding part of title?

360
00:34:23,390 --> 00:34:30,590
Is it accumulated police experience that says something like an African young man's accumulated police experience?

361
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:37,340
Yeah, I think what I was attempting to talk about eloquently was like dealing with the Ahmaud Arbery case,

362
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:45,530
like where people just take it upon themselves, like, you know, vigilantism or, you know, the Klan or, you know, just, you know,

363
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:53,540
groups of people who get together and decide even in the, you know, the the history of lynching where, you know, community violence,

364
00:34:53,690 --> 00:35:00,920
you know, that not necessarily by law enforcement, but people who see themselves as, you know, maintaining the social order.

365
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:04,849
So that's what I was attempting to say. No, that makes complete sense.

366
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:11,240
I just want to make sure to interpret that correctly. And then my follow up question is like, do you have a panel tonight?

367
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:22,070
We have policy. I was wondering, do you intend with your research to go into policy and how did you get there, I guess is the question.

368
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:28,670
Yeah. As the interesting to the conversation your professor and I had about how do you see yourself?

369
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:35,269
And I think I talked about like, you know, certainly criminology, you know, it's my origin.

370
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:38,810
But as things have moved along, sometimes I think about sociology.

371
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:44,510
But I do think in terms of policies, the direction that I've moved in as of late because,

372
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:50,840
you know, most of us, because you get just, you know, tired of hearing these stories, you know?

373
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:54,860
So I've been doing this for quite some time in different cities and different samples.

374
00:35:55,190 --> 00:36:01,060
And, you know, young men of color, particularly young black males, have a similar story to tell.

375
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:07,580
And so part of that is, yes, we identify problems, but I want to be part of identifying solutions.

376
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:16,760
So what can we do? And I think only through policy has to be talked about in terms of policy that mandated reporting of police misbehavior.

377
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:23,989
We would hope that things that officers would do that on their own. But we've seen, you know, time and time again that they want.

378
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:25,760
So maybe we have a policy.

379
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:34,790
So I think policy is the best, I guess, remedy that we have for the unwanted behavior that we see and that the policy is perfect.

380
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:41,059
And I always take my students to task because they try to they always gravitate

381
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:47,000
toward particularly students I've had that have been in law enforcement. They're equipped to me, as always, there needs to be more training.

382
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:51,620
And I'm like, I think that's a catch all like that. That is kind of a mess.

383
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:56,449
Ignored that we have a problem and the training can't solve all the problems that we have.

384
00:36:56,450 --> 00:37:02,930
People are trained, but that doesn't mean that people are using their training and what do we train them to do and who are they being trained by?

385
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:07,280
And, you know, can we really have reform for a system that, as you point out,

386
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:15,290
that was predicated and founded on a system of oppression and inequality to begin with?

387
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:23,660
You know, the whole policing model, you know, slave patrols, etc., each have another question until you're really.

388
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:29,420
I think very quick. So now since you found the article, you have to read it.

389
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:35,120
So yesterday I got two questions for you.

390
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:40,130
You are like this theme to this talk.

391
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:46,849
So in Detroit, there's the Green Light Initiative. I don't know if you're familiar with it, but essentially it's green lights posted on gas stations,

392
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:50,750
small businesses and things like that with direct access to the police department.

393
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:54,500
But what is green light mean? I mean, what's the green?

394
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:59,150
This little green light that has a camera attached to it, you see it on top of a gas station,

395
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:02,930
a building that lets you know that there's direct communication.

396
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:06,890
Someone is monitoring the screen 24 hours and the police department.

397
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:13,010
Okay. It's obviously in most things and minority communities.

398
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:18,500
I'm curious, too. Well, I guess you would have to look and see more about that to offer your interpretation.

399
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:22,010
But I wouldn't get outright. Outright.

400
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:30,440
Yeah, I guess. What are your thoughts on police surveillance and adopting technology and the use of phones, cameras and things like that?

401
00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:36,870
Yeah, I think part of it with a healthy dose of skepticism, the technology hasn't always served us well.

402
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:39,970
I like people that are from disadvantaged minority communities.

403
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:41,630
And how is it going to be used?

404
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:48,830
You know, they're going to be used to reduce crime or it's going to be used, as you pointed out, to be an additional form of surveillance.

405
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:52,880
I find it interesting that the green light from a safety standpoint,

406
00:38:52,880 --> 00:39:00,740
like if you're in trouble or somebody is following you, you can go here and seek some police intervention, etc.

407
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:08,170
But I think that people are rightfully probably skeptical of at least some of the initiatives,

408
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:14,389
technological advances with facial recognition, voice recognition and all these other.

409
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:21,200
And how's it going? How is the technology going to be used? How are these instruments that are intended to be for the betterment of society?

410
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:31,550
It comes back to faith and trust, and I do we have the trust, given the historical abuses, that these things are going to be used appropriately and,

411
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:38,840
you know, to help keep people safe, where they're going to be used to further exploit, you know, some of the inequalities that exist.

412
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:51,100
Yeah, I got kind of a follow up question that there's two or three I'm going to play because I'm trying to come from where I come from,

413
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:54,920
trying to and being in academia, but also still being present in my neighborhood.

414
00:39:55,340 --> 00:40:02,690
Where do you come from? Southwest Detroit. Okay, I say, what attitude is the number at a about it?

415
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:07,300
I've never been there. You were kind of defensive. No, that's always the comedian thing.

416
00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:13,010
Go ahead. I'm trying to find a line because in one way I see how the Green Light Initiative

417
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:17,270
is doing good in a sense of that is getting those guns off the street,

418
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:20,930
it's reducing drug transactions, things like that.

419
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:27,860
But it's also reversing where the crime is happening to be more prevalent in neighborhood schools and things like that.

420
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:35,710
Yeah. Redirect network and redirecting it to just different areas that are neighborhood.

421
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:42,550
So I guess is like. As someone who was on both sides of the field, how do I interpret that?

422
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:47,980
How do I make sense of that, considering that the law is the same or have been the same for dinner?

423
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:52,989
I know I think everybody has to make their own kind of peace with those things.

424
00:40:52,990 --> 00:41:00,140
And so is the notion of, you know, we can have and I would say to people, we can have crime free communities.

425
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:05,169
You know, if we were willing to tolerate comes with that as a society you know like the police

426
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:10,330
could crack down and stop everything that moves and reduce crime dramatically.

427
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:15,490
But at what cost? The cost of people's constitutional rights and protections.

428
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:21,070
So I think you have to find the balance in that, not that you have to give up your constitutional rights and protections,

429
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:25,030
but what level of we do this all the time, I think in this society,

430
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:31,929
what level of intrusion are we willing to accept, you know, for the sake of public safety?

431
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:35,860
And I think about in terms of yesterday going to the airport, like, you know,

432
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:40,419
we're willing to let people go through our bags and they take our shoes off and all these other things.

433
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:48,730
In the interest of public safety, we are willing to allow and accept some intrusion, some level of intrusion.

434
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:56,080
So that back to you like so what do you as an individual level the question so so I'll ask you what are you willing to tolerate.

435
00:41:56,470 --> 00:41:56,860
You know,

436
00:41:56,860 --> 00:42:05,170
so the green light is one thing is the green light better than having aggressive police patrols where people are being indiscriminately stopped,

437
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:11,470
you know, for walking down the street or, you know, driving erratically or whatever the reason is?

438
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:18,610
Is this less intrusive? I guess. And it's unfortunate that we have to kind of pick our poison and say, what is the lesser of two evils?

439
00:42:18,610 --> 00:42:23,740
But that's kind of how I see it. So for you, is that a reasonable tradeoff?

440
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:29,330
I have to think about that. Right. Yes, ma'am.

441
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:33,590
I have a question in terms of your policy. How much of.

442
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:43,970
Have conversations with just because in reference to the roles, you might just not disrespect the Green Light initiative.

443
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:51,140
Different prejudices are going to be enhanced for some communities and especially for.

444
00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:59,180
Impression that, like, I don't I didn't know anything about the initiative,

445
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:04,110
only that it's basically a sign that I should not go into an establishment like that that's very passionate.

446
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:12,710
And I'm coming back and I feel like I mean, the policy changes the way that we perceive different.

447
00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:19,080
Who's been important. That's interesting because that is the unintended consequence.

448
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:23,489
So I think about like some communities that I've been in and so I lived in Boston for a while

449
00:43:23,490 --> 00:43:28,770
and other cities where I see these signs that say under surveillance or police surveillance,

450
00:43:28,770 --> 00:43:36,209
I'm like, Well, why am I here? You know, that's okay. So it can have that kind of you can't have that, you know, unintended consequences,

451
00:43:36,210 --> 00:43:41,520
signaling to people that the community's unsafe or this place is unsafe and that I shouldn't be here.

452
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:47,610
But in terms of policy, I think, you know, we need to have, you know, policy that's based on evidence, I guess,

453
00:43:47,610 --> 00:43:53,849
and not, you know, too susceptible, kind of like to knee jerk reactions about, oh, you know, what do we do?

454
00:43:53,850 --> 00:43:58,140
So I live in Baltimore, so I work at the University of Maryland College Park.

455
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:01,940
And, you know, there there's some but I'm still learning about Baltimore.

456
00:44:01,950 --> 00:44:06,810
Like there are places in the city that are very, you know, problematic and high crime.

457
00:44:07,650 --> 00:44:13,830
But there are other places in the city that seem to be, you know, tourist attractions, etc.

458
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:17,190
So different crime strategies for different neighborhoods.

459
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:25,740
And not to say that people have to forfeit their constitutional rights because they live in underserved, disadvantaged, poor communities.

460
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:31,230
But it does require a different type of policing, a different level of police presence.

461
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:36,930
So I guess what I'm saying is policy needs to be informed by evidence and we can only get

462
00:44:36,930 --> 00:44:44,430
good evidence if we involve the community in the design of our public safety initiatives.

463
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:49,250
Because it goes back to your colleagues question like what is the community willing to embrace?

464
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:53,550
Like what is the community willing to the tradeoff that they're willing to make?

465
00:44:53,880 --> 00:45:03,720
And again, I go back to to Boston, and one of the initiatives that they had was where police officers would come to they could be called to a home.

466
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:10,020
A parent could call the police and say, hey, I think my my my teenage dad's gun and I want you to get out of here.

467
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:12,750
And the police made a promise, well, we're not going to arrest them.

468
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:19,980
We just want to confiscate the gun and decide, you know, so that parent made the decision they're willing to go through some,

469
00:45:20,190 --> 00:45:27,030
you know, intrusive, kind of without a warrant, allowing police officers search the home because they wanted the gun out of the house.

470
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:32,489
So those are the kind of trade offs that we have to make as a as a as a citizenry.

471
00:45:32,490 --> 00:45:36,870
But also, policies should be informed by that. The evidence is my summary.

472
00:45:38,290 --> 00:45:46,810
Yes. Or did you have two questions and say, oh, I was just curious, has there been like a lot of,

473
00:45:46,990 --> 00:45:51,850
um, I guess, positive or negative feedback from the police directly to your work?

474
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:54,820
You know, I like to think they read it.

475
00:45:54,820 --> 00:46:00,549
They don't know, you know, I'm just I just that they don't and I mean, I don't I'm not saying that they should.

476
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:05,320
And that is one of the I guess the comment that I get some town hall.

477
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:12,070
I remember where I was and I was somewhat annoyed at the time by but I understood it when I had time to process it.

478
00:46:12,430 --> 00:46:16,480
So someone stood up and I kind of interpreted as kind of like a finger wagging way and they were like,

479
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:18,760
Well, have you ever shared these things with the police?

480
00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:24,910
And I kind of, you know, again, the interest of being a comedian, I just said to the person, you know, not really.

481
00:46:25,090 --> 00:46:27,090
As the police know, everything I told you,

482
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:34,450
my data is not that they don't know that young people are mistreated or that young men of color are suspected of criminal involvement,

483
00:46:34,450 --> 00:46:41,230
even when they're not involved. So I don't know what I could do to, you know, to to educate police.

484
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:44,680
Like, if they were really interested, I would be I would have a conversation with them.

485
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:47,740
But I don't think I could tell them anything that they don't already know.

486
00:46:48,790 --> 00:46:53,139
So that may be an unsatisfying question, but I have you know,

487
00:46:53,140 --> 00:47:00,280
I'm very careful about I don't want to be seen as I'm not a police apologist, but I'm also not anti-police.

488
00:47:00,670 --> 00:47:07,510
I want to work with police agencies, particularly police departments that are which I have had some really good relationships with

489
00:47:08,020 --> 00:47:15,700
police leadership that are earnestly interested in helping to find solutions instead of,

490
00:47:16,090 --> 00:47:21,550
you know, putting their heads in the sand and say, this doesn't exist or my officers don't do that, etc., etc.

491
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:25,330
So it really depends on the police department and if you have really good leadership.

492
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:31,930
I think that they're open to hearing things that are not always favorable and it doesn't paint

493
00:47:31,930 --> 00:47:38,890
the whole department with a brush of a broad brush of either incompetence or misconduct.

494
00:47:39,310 --> 00:47:43,320
But these things happen and we have to acknowledge them instead of, you know,

495
00:47:43,390 --> 00:47:49,870
wishing that they didn't happen and and not being willing to address the realities that people live every day on the streets.

496
00:47:53,370 --> 00:48:00,330
Yes, sir. My last question for you, since this is public health, are you familiar with the purge law of Chicago?

497
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:05,760
No, no. Educate me. You've already asked me about the green light.

498
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:13,500
Essentially, there they are getting rid of cash bills.

499
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:20,670
So essentially, if you commit a crime and you have to do it has to be proven in order for them to make an arrest.

500
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:23,070
And then I don't know if that's the whole truth.

501
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:31,950
And then just like this, what I got from it, but understanding like how Ed understanding the implications of bail has had on certain demographics,

502
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:38,760
is it just let to leave or just being in prison for longer than they should be by removing it entirely?

503
00:48:40,270 --> 00:48:46,680
And again, I don't know where I'm going with it, but I'm trying to. I was trying to get your thoughts in of that.

504
00:48:47,350 --> 00:48:53,159
Yeah. I will say, you know, one of the things I've learned is I try not to speak about things that I'm I'm informed about.

505
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:55,560
And so I'd be very careful with what I what I am,

506
00:48:55,590 --> 00:49:02,399
I think is related to what you've spoken about is the increased attention now or around fines and fees.

507
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:06,440
Right. So I don't know if this is the situation in Detroit on the area.

508
00:49:06,450 --> 00:49:13,620
And so I know the different places where I live is that some of them have like hundreds of municipalities in

509
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:19,860
the surrounding areas and a lot of those municipalities live and die in their budgets by writing tickets,

510
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:22,709
you know, and having night courts and all these other things.

511
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:31,260
So it seems like this was a step toward reform that you are mentioned in this effort, but it may have gone too far in the other direction.

512
00:49:36,150 --> 00:49:48,840
Yeah. Yeah, I mean, you. So what parts of it do you, I guess, are you bothered by some of the the crowd that you can commit and not be detained for?

513
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:55,139
So it goes from second degree murder, kidnaping, robbery and mercury prize money and then threatening things like that.

514
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:59,780
So you can't be held for those without proof.

515
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:02,350
Uh, yeah. I mean, I think so.

516
00:50:02,370 --> 00:50:12,930
Again, the tension of, uh, and how I would say in terms of going back to the question about the Black Lives Matter campaign,

517
00:50:13,470 --> 00:50:16,560
it's a one of the things I was asked to do and I didn't know how I felt about it.

518
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:18,170
I was becoming a little frustrated,

519
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:26,310
so I got an opportunity to write a piece for you don't have to look it up for the Washington Post around defund the police.

520
00:50:27,030 --> 00:50:32,249
And I commented on that because it wasn't typically what I do like I you know, I write research articles.

521
00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:38,129
I'm not really interested in being a public criminologist and I interested in being on the nightly news,

522
00:50:38,130 --> 00:50:42,209
etc. And I don't begrudge people who want to do that, but that's just not my my thing.

523
00:50:42,210 --> 00:50:47,090
Right? So one of the things that bothered me about this,

524
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:56,130
why I to you what concerned you is that I saw it as making communities that are already high risk communities or high crime communities less safe.

525
00:50:56,610 --> 00:50:58,290
So we talk about defunding the police.

526
00:50:58,710 --> 00:51:05,010
Where do we replace it when we in its early days, you know, there wasn't a clear message of what was meant by defund the police.

527
00:51:05,250 --> 00:51:08,820
I get the fact people were angry, people wanted something done,

528
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:15,089
certainly in the aftermath of George Floyd and also the people who were calling for defunding the police.

529
00:51:15,090 --> 00:51:20,490
And I think I said this in hopefully a respectful way. And you tell me if you happened to read it,

530
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:28,590
was that the people who have to bear the burdens of defunding the police are not the ones who are calling for defunding the police,

531
00:51:28,590 --> 00:51:32,459
like they're going to have police in their tranquil middle class neighborhoods.

532
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:39,990
They're not calling for defunding their police. They're calling for defunding the police, the people in certain communities, unfortunately, police.

533
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:45,450
The only reliable service that people can depend on that the police you call 911, they're going to show up.

534
00:51:45,450 --> 00:51:51,299
Now, they may not always show up and do the right thing or show up and do what we want them to do, but they're going to show up.

535
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:55,590
So I kind of see it as what you're saying is that is this making communities less safe?

536
00:51:56,010 --> 00:52:02,490
And one of the things that I've found in some of the work that I've been doing with young people who are involved in gun violence,

537
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:10,080
one of the things that escalated gun violence is that when they saw people that they knew were responsible for shooting someone else,

538
00:52:10,530 --> 00:52:13,830
triumphantly walking through the neighborhood and there were no consequences.

539
00:52:14,190 --> 00:52:16,440
So does that make people feel more or less safe?

540
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:22,800
And does that make people more or less likely to pick up a gun because they feel they don't have any recourse?

541
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:28,260
And that's what kind of what you were explaining or at least presenting to me makes me think about.

542
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:32,910
You know, is that in fairness, is that good for the community?

543
00:52:33,210 --> 00:52:38,820
Like, I can understand people wanting some reform around bills, but, you know,

544
00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:43,800
for certain crimes, particularly serious violent crime, we want people held accountable.

545
00:52:44,490 --> 00:52:52,220
And whether, you know, that's what the justice system is for. And as imperfect as it is, like, say, people have to go to trial before, you know,

546
00:52:52,290 --> 00:52:59,460
you let them come back into the community and either they are now targets for retribution or they're going to,

547
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:04,590
you know, continue their violent tendencies that they've displayed so far.

548
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:09,600
So are you pro-law or or con that initiative?

549
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:16,900
I think that that's just too far, right, that yeah, I see what they were trying to do, but they.

550
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:24,050
I mean, if we can think about initiative that we talk about policy like the 100 to 1 crack to powder cocaine,

551
00:53:24,050 --> 00:53:29,270
you know, that initiative that was supported by the Congressional Black Caucus at the time?

552
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:34,370
You know, that that we punish powder cocaine, crack cocaine 100 times.

553
00:53:34,370 --> 00:53:39,830
You do powder even though we need powder to make crack. You know, and the racial disparities that that produced.

554
00:53:40,190 --> 00:53:46,759
So I think it was with good intentions because crack was wreaking havoc in certain communities that we focused on,

555
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:50,900
even though we know why there was widespread use and not just among people of color.

556
00:53:51,410 --> 00:53:57,979
But that was the narrative. So we have this 100 to 1 ratio to try to correct it, and we probably went in the wrong direction.

557
00:53:57,980 --> 00:54:05,630
And the impact is that we have people of color serving longer sentences for drug possession

558
00:54:05,870 --> 00:54:11,809
and that they need 100 times as much powder as they had crack to get the same sentences.

559
00:54:11,810 --> 00:54:16,340
And that disproportionately impacted, you know, young black males.

560
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:25,799
It's a great question. Even it was only one. Anybody else?

561
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:31,590
Someone who I haven't heard from? Yes. I want to know your thoughts on our police response.

562
00:54:32,850 --> 00:54:38,860
Health crisis. My first question and then secondly, what would you say are.

563
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:45,050
Build a better relationship. Communities.

564
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:55,340
You know, training kind of not being. Yeah, I think it's really good.

565
00:54:56,410 --> 00:54:57,620
And I've said this before,

566
00:54:57,950 --> 00:55:06,620
the the onus is on police departments that they have the institutional capacity to mandate through policy what police officers would do.

567
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:13,490
You know, citizens we don't like, I can't tell all of you are to go and find a police officer and have a civil cordial conversation with them.

568
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:18,470
But it also comes down to accountability that when police officers engage in

569
00:55:18,470 --> 00:55:24,320
behavior that we would view as inappropriate and unsatisfactory or disrespectful,

570
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:27,700
etc., that they need to be held accountable for those.

571
00:55:27,710 --> 00:55:37,310
So I think, again, it goes back to the police leadership being serious about improving police community relations and what does that mean?

572
00:55:37,670 --> 00:55:44,990
And I often, you know, kind of bristle in addition to training, one of things I also kind of smirk about is this notion of community policing,

573
00:55:45,380 --> 00:55:51,740
because we're hard pressed to know what that is, but you'd be hard pressed to find a department that says they don't do it.

574
00:55:52,130 --> 00:55:56,630
And there, you know, because you don't want to say, I don't do community policing, but what does that look like?

575
00:55:56,630 --> 00:56:03,680
Does that look like as I said before, my early experience in the city of Chicago that we get all of the elderly residents

576
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:06,620
of this neighborhood together once a month in the basement of the church,

577
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:12,680
and they have cookies and punch and they meet with the officers, you know, who they already have a relationship with.

578
00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:19,910
But what about the people who aren't inclined to come to that community meeting or don't have favorable relationships with the police?

579
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:23,870
How can those things be remedied? And I forgot the second part of your question.

580
00:56:26,430 --> 00:56:30,410
Your opinion on our police response. Behavioral health crisis.

581
00:56:36,380 --> 00:56:40,400
I'm not opposed to that. I think it's somebody who is against a case by case basis.

582
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:43,850
I think in some instances that is appropriate.

583
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:47,569
But in others we don't want to put, you know, officers also in harm's way.

584
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:54,020
So I can understand that. So it's kind of like this. The notion we have, we try to do some correction, but do we go too far?

585
00:56:55,340 --> 00:57:02,180
But I you know, there have been work done says that sometimes the presence of a weapon can escalate situations.

586
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:08,820
And so maybe if police officers, you know, maybe someone there, it is armed, but they aren't in the police uniform.

587
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:15,020
You know, maybe need there aren't like, you know, it doesn't kind of further agitate or escalate the situation.

588
00:57:15,770 --> 00:57:23,660
But I definitely believe one of the things that I was in favor of for this whole discussion about defunding the police was that,

589
00:57:24,050 --> 00:57:32,060
you know, seeking where we can shift resources to groups that were perhaps better trained,

590
00:57:32,060 --> 00:57:39,500
better equipped and in actually want to do this type of work that was needed, you know, in terms of intervening in the mental health crisis, etc.

591
00:57:39,830 --> 00:57:41,750
So it doesn't mean that we don't have the police,

592
00:57:42,140 --> 00:57:48,410
but we have the police deployed to do the things that they are better equipped to do as opposed to asking them to do everything.

593
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:55,850
Because we have an invested in other institutions and social services in the same way that we have in the police.

594
00:57:59,530 --> 00:58:06,090
Anybody. I have one question that may lead into the question and answer the first now.

595
00:58:06,130 --> 00:58:16,810
Okay. So is two for one is most of your research like Baltimore North and like I would always say this and that and I really do.

596
00:58:16,930 --> 00:58:26,259
I mean, I'll go where I really am. So it's really been in some instances is where I've been invited in some instances has been where I've worked like.

597
00:58:26,260 --> 00:58:29,469
So I've done a lot of work and I try to do work in places where I live.

598
00:58:29,470 --> 00:58:34,330
So I'm relatively new to Baltimore. I've only been there, um, this is my second year.

599
00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:40,480
So before that I was in Northeastern for, for a couple of years in Boston and for I was in New Jersey.

600
00:58:41,250 --> 00:58:46,180
So this would be recorded. I only say nice things about Jersey and I live in New Jersey for like ten years.

601
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:54,100
And so some of the work that I did was in Newark, some of the work that deals in New York City, one of the one of the trade offs and again,

602
00:58:54,670 --> 00:59:01,329
Professor and I had this conversation of doing qualitative work is that I don't have the large sample sizes.

603
00:59:01,330 --> 00:59:08,290
Right. And I don't have the army of researchers to deploy to get, you know, representative samples.

604
00:59:08,620 --> 00:59:14,530
So a lot of it is kind of sweat equity. A lot of labor is involved in the city before the New York study.

605
00:59:14,950 --> 00:59:18,069
We're there for a year before we start ask some questions. So it takes a lot of time.

606
00:59:18,070 --> 00:59:23,940
And if I'm only one person that's certain to have town to graduate students to help, but it's only so much.

607
00:59:23,950 --> 00:59:28,060
I don't have the capacity to handle multi city projects most of the time,

608
00:59:28,570 --> 00:59:33,120
so I do have to give a plug for study that I was involved in before I left and still

609
00:59:33,140 --> 00:59:39,520
involved with the NSF supported study in Boston around reentry returning citizens.

610
00:59:39,850 --> 00:59:46,780
And so we sought to interview 120 people returning to Boston about the reentry challenges,

611
00:59:46,780 --> 00:59:52,560
whether it's employment, housing, mental health services, etc.

612
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:59,840
Again, to kind of get a sense of what are we know like from the literature, what the literature says, some of the challenges are the West,

613
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:06,370
the reality and particularly in a place like Boston, Massachusetts, that's supposed to be they call it Corey Corey Friendly.

614
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:12,460
And I forgot the exact acronym, but it's something about basically, in spite of your criminal record,

615
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:19,630
that employers don't ask questions about your past convictions at the initial stages to

616
01:00:19,780 --> 01:00:23,530
to be more friendly toward people who have prior criminal justice system involvement.

617
01:00:23,860 --> 01:00:28,780
So that's one of the things we really wanted to see in a quarry friendly place.

618
01:00:29,170 --> 01:00:32,809
Are those challenges just the same, you know, and that's where policy comes in.

619
01:00:32,810 --> 01:00:41,080
And so if it's just as difficult to get a job in a place that's supposedly quarry friendly and where a lot of the young men, when they're young men,

620
01:00:41,110 --> 01:00:49,900
a lot of the men told us, was that, you know, employers may say they're quarry friendly, but it really depends on your offense, too, and so on.

621
01:00:50,410 --> 01:00:57,010
You know how long you've been away and I don't know what the mean or the average is,

622
01:00:57,670 --> 01:01:02,140
but most of the people, at least that I directly interviewed were like middle age.

623
01:01:02,620 --> 01:01:09,430
And one of the more, I guess, sobering stories was from this Middle East guy who's trying his fifties,

624
01:01:10,510 --> 01:01:13,309
they began thinking that they had to relearn technology or learn technology.

625
01:01:13,310 --> 01:01:17,350
And I relearned like a lot of things that aren't even invented when they were last out.

626
01:01:17,890 --> 01:01:23,830
And one of the questions to try to end on a good note is all of these kind of traumatic experiences that we're asking the women about,

627
01:01:23,830 --> 01:01:29,650
we ask about childhood trauma, first time of arrest and juvenile, etc., etc.,

628
01:01:30,190 --> 01:01:33,220
and when the last questions that we ask is, So what are you most proud of?

629
01:01:33,970 --> 01:01:39,640
You know, and one again, middle aged man said to me, I'm most proud that this is the longest I've ever been out.

630
01:01:40,450 --> 01:01:49,030
And he was in his fifties and he had only been out for 3 to 5 years, but most of his adult life he was incarcerated.

631
01:01:49,870 --> 01:01:55,419
And so, again, that's that's really sobering to think about that, like all the things that have changed,

632
01:01:55,420 --> 01:02:03,819
all the people who have passed away since he's been, you know, incarcerated, etc., and now we're saying go out and make a way in.

633
01:02:03,820 --> 01:02:08,050
This whole new world is so different than it was when you were 18 or 20 years old.

634
01:02:09,460 --> 01:02:12,010
And that was a departure from what I was supposed to talk about.

635
01:02:12,010 --> 01:02:18,430
But it's made me think about how you and I try to think about like these are these are people, you know, these are people's lives.

636
01:02:18,430 --> 01:02:22,299
These are not just, you know, pseudonyms in the publication, like.

637
01:02:22,300 --> 01:02:29,200
And when I write and when I read the articles after the fact, I can actually see the people like as if they were sitting across from me.

638
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:35,589
So for me, that's when I hope that I bring to the work like a sincere appreciation for that.

639
01:02:35,590 --> 01:02:39,280
These are people's lives, they die variables, you know, they're not dots on the map.

640
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:44,930
They're, you know, humans. All right.

641
01:02:44,930 --> 01:02:51,270
So we have to we have to end on a happy note. I know I brought everybody down all the way through.

642
01:02:52,700 --> 01:03:02,810
I don't know how long we have in. Closing your final question for Dr. Rosen with your question, but I do have a question.

643
01:03:02,990 --> 01:03:12,110
All right. Just do you any advice for us as public health professionals on how to rule about communications with law

644
01:03:12,110 --> 01:03:18,710
enforcement who may have had a first hand or second hand traumatic experiences with them in the past?

645
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:27,080
You're interested in it, even though it still affects you? Yeah, I think just, you know, I don't have all the answers.

646
01:03:27,090 --> 01:03:36,330
I think just to be honest with yourself, you know, in terms of what you have the capacity to do and how it weighs on you, you know, as a professional,

647
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:44,340
but also due to work with, you know, integrity and bring your authentic self because that people can tell you you're not being authentic,

648
01:03:44,340 --> 01:03:51,120
you know, and if you can do that and to have empathy and show that you care beyond that, this is your job,

649
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:57,180
that you really believe that you can help, you know, to use the trite example, quote, to be and to make a difference.

650
01:03:57,510 --> 01:04:01,079
But I think making a difference is, you know, can't be overstated.

651
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:04,250
And and we don't we don't know how we impact people, you know,

652
01:04:04,350 --> 01:04:10,530
when we interact with them and just be mindful that it could be a really good interaction or it could be a really bad interaction.

653
01:04:13,950 --> 01:04:17,700
They're happy to be back and sharing. It's not going to be happy.

654
01:04:18,350 --> 01:04:23,150
No, I think it's. Do you have any pets? Very different.

655
01:04:23,170 --> 01:04:26,990
I know. And that's just. I'm just selfish.

656
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:32,129
I can't take care of something else, so I can't do it. If people have pets, you have responsibilities.

657
01:04:32,130 --> 01:04:37,110
You got to, like, can't travel. You got it. They got friends, they have pets, and they won't put them in kennels.

658
01:04:37,110 --> 01:04:42,030
And I'm not saying they should, but it just limits your ability to.

659
01:04:42,060 --> 01:04:45,630
It was a very different question, just listening to your ability to live your life.

660
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:50,940
I mean, if I think if I ever got a pet, I would. I like fish, so.

661
01:04:51,030 --> 01:04:52,410
But I don't want to clean the tank.

662
01:04:53,010 --> 01:05:00,690
So if I could pay somebody to pay somebody to come in and clean and and stuff like that, I just want to look in on you.

663
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:05,139
Do you have any pets? No, I really don't. I keep going back and forth.

664
01:05:05,140 --> 01:05:11,040
I think we should have. No, no. All right.

665
01:05:11,070 --> 01:05:16,680
Well, thank you, Dr. Graziano. And I'm sure.

666
01:05:18,530 --> 01:05:23,830
And Hamilton, is that is it for you asking difficult questions?

667
01:05:25,190 --> 01:05:28,960
I think it might be 4:00. And look, I can to public policy, you know,

668
01:05:28,970 --> 01:05:32,450
be able to hear from Dr. Brunson as well as a couple of other scholars coming

669
01:05:32,450 --> 01:05:39,760
from outside to talk broadly about what's underneath or where somebody is at.

670
01:05:40,510 --> 01:05:44,870
733 Yeah, somebody I think I'm supposed to get picked up.

671
01:05:44,930 --> 01:05:47,600
Oh yeah. With as well. If I'm late already,

672
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:57,240
I blame you on speaking with the office and say it's quick like so my email addresses are Brunson at UMD got

673
01:05:57,290 --> 01:06:06,380
Edu so happy to hear more about whatever it is you're working on and how the rest of your semester goes.

674
01:06:07,100 --> 01:06:13,880
Thank you. All right, all right. All right. So let's reconvene at one.

675
01:06:15,050 --> 01:06:20,290
So you guys talk about something that you don't hear a lot of words.

676
01:06:20,370 --> 01:06:23,579
I see Dr. Resume.

677
01:06:23,580 --> 01:06:28,250
Maybe you're offered or recommended. You want to ask a question or. But, yeah, what if I could come back?

678
01:06:28,250 --> 01:06:32,750
We'll talk a little bit and move forward. So, yeah, yeah.

679
01:06:32,750 --> 01:06:35,900
I think I might need to go meet my person. Yeah.

680
01:06:35,970 --> 01:06:39,560
And I can take you wherever that is. Things right out from the building.

681
01:06:39,860 --> 01:06:44,419
Okay. You know, it even suggested I know it's somebody in a car.

682
01:06:44,420 --> 01:06:52,120
So you think it's the guy to drive me off? I like the pictures.

683
01:06:52,750 --> 01:06:56,880
Now, you just shamed me like that. You're no good.

684
01:06:57,160 --> 01:07:01,660
It's not that I don't have anything against Vince. I just don't want to have to take care of him.

685
01:07:01,810 --> 01:07:05,530
No, there's a lot of. There is? Yeah. I'm not a grown up like that yet.

686
01:07:07,420 --> 01:07:11,260
Thank you. I hope to see some of you later. All right. All right.

687
01:07:15,420 --> 01:07:18,420
It didn't work for these men that you could just go.

688
01:07:18,420 --> 01:07:25,650
I just think have I think questions about what kinds of food preferences are good and people like.

689
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:37,190
It's just that it's not having. I just wonder if you have any thoughts without interest in this whole area.

690
01:07:40,380 --> 01:07:43,980
Oh, yeah. It's something that I would like.

691
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:57,370
It's not like I'm, like, 10 minutes to do there.

692
01:07:57,780 --> 01:08:02,140
It feels less dangerous. Yeah. I just.

693
01:08:02,210 --> 01:08:08,140
I don't know if it's.

694
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:20,780
I think the one thing I can say is that if he doesn't do it, I should have told you.

695
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:23,880
I don't. You know what I mean? Yeah.

696
01:08:23,900 --> 01:08:34,820
Yeah, they were. But that's okay. You know, it's like you're like, oh, this is all that?

697
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:41,170
Everything to the party. That's a shame.

698
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:46,460
Yeah, that's what I.

699
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:52,940
Yeah, I like it. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah.

700
01:08:54,560 --> 01:09:00,830
Yeah. I'm not too happy with the main this year.

701
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:06,180
Right now. It should we launch our measures this month, but that's about it.

702
01:09:07,250 --> 01:09:10,870
So I really don't like. I got an apartment.

703
01:09:10,870 --> 01:09:16,740
What was it? This is like. This is the time I do you think this is exactly what I mean?

704
01:09:18,170 --> 01:09:26,510
You know, I don't know. We have, like the current night where this is going on and yeah, like,

705
01:09:26,530 --> 01:09:37,980
it's not like I just feel like upper echelon of the doctors and all of your throat.

706
01:09:38,060 --> 01:09:42,560
Um, so you want. Want to be. I don't want to see what I want.

707
01:09:42,860 --> 01:09:54,350
The usual options. I don't want to be like because I'm like, can you just like I don't need that's so much worse.

708
01:09:54,900 --> 01:09:58,100
I mean, I heard you like the rest of your day.

709
01:10:00,410 --> 01:10:08,070
The things that make sense for everything so far. You've her to eat a lot.

710
01:10:08,820 --> 01:10:12,960
Yeah, I like them when it comes. Yeah.

711
01:10:14,050 --> 01:10:18,980
The beginning of the day, I feel like they are going out there like 500.

712
01:10:20,360 --> 01:10:26,360
You know, I'm not going to hurt anyone. I hate it even more for you.

713
01:10:26,950 --> 01:10:30,290
I mean, maybe you don't want to do that. Yeah.

714
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:35,060
I mean, you know, I was like, it's really good.

715
01:10:35,060 --> 01:10:39,530
I really love you. Just put a laugh, rather, and I can't read.

716
01:10:39,530 --> 01:10:49,640
Everybody's like, Oh, no, it's not like the help, but I don't want to hear anything more than right there, you know?

717
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:56,610
Yeah, yeah, I suppose. No, probably. I mean, I'm still full time still.

718
01:10:56,630 --> 01:11:08,210
So I just I also think it's so interesting because that's how I look.

719
01:11:08,870 --> 01:11:20,480
I know that's not really things you make a whole lot of for you, but I think you I was like, Oh, yeah, you're trying to do something.

720
01:11:20,810 --> 01:11:27,430
I just I think mentally, you know.

721
01:11:28,250 --> 01:11:35,910
Yeah, I do. Thinking and that's why I, you know, out of it.

722
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:56,000
Yeah. Yeah, I don't I came from like the and then and I was like, yeah, I would really like to see an apple.

723
01:11:56,450 --> 01:12:04,340
Yeah, I think so. Yeah. You do use one particular case for a penalty.

724
01:12:04,970 --> 01:12:10,250
You look for one.

725
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:22,490
You could do security if this. I'm just going to say, no, I don't have any of the things that I work for more than 4 hours all the time.

726
01:12:23,490 --> 01:12:36,110
Oh, yeah, yeah. No, I would definitely want to.

727
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:40,040
I'll tell you, I think that, you know.

728
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:46,930
Yeah. So you have to pay a premium.

729
01:12:47,810 --> 01:12:51,280
Would you then have it. But I don't think it'll happen like you haven't heard.

730
01:12:51,380 --> 01:13:06,800
Yeah. Yeah, you know, like that, that, that's already I think that's where I listen to a point where I don't have a point, to be honest.

731
01:13:06,830 --> 01:13:11,360
I have to go through that.

732
01:13:12,630 --> 01:13:22,970
I forgot. You're like, I'm like, ah, you know, I'm hooked up with my brother.

733
01:13:24,380 --> 01:13:34,160
And I literally have the problem with, like, my professional.

734
01:13:34,340 --> 01:13:46,140
Oh, I was like, I'm pretty much uncomfortable. So I, I living through a lot more than that.

735
01:13:47,610 --> 01:13:56,000
I still pretty much I would do like goes along with it.

736
01:13:56,240 --> 01:14:06,950
He's really good. That's why I only want to be expensive.

737
01:14:08,090 --> 01:14:14,740
So I go, do I really like apply for cars that are more European?

738
01:14:14,990 --> 01:14:25,610
But yeah, so, so I think that's the way that it's kind of like I'm, you know, just because I want,

739
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:41,929
I want someone like yourself where he's like, I know this is like, like my whole life has been doing this for police officers and everybody.

740
01:14:41,930 --> 01:14:45,500
This I just go to a couple of times on the air.

741
01:14:47,510 --> 01:14:58,280
I would go there, you know, and I, I tell you, I hope I, you know, insurance market, they were getting too much because.

742
01:15:00,580 --> 01:15:05,210
So write about what you know. And that's what you hear so much.

743
01:15:05,620 --> 01:15:13,500
And it's more like it's actually the want to hear it, but it's also something that definitely.

744
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:23,190
She has only half. But it's not really fair. I already a.

745
01:15:25,580 --> 01:15:33,220
Do you want to release your hands? Jonathan was probably thinking that should be different.

746
01:15:34,940 --> 01:15:37,990
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

747
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:41,350
I just know how to get it to talk to him. You know, it's just.

748
01:15:41,350 --> 01:15:45,180
Oh, I don't really know what you get, etc.

749
01:15:45,190 --> 01:15:49,060
But he told me that our first date.

750
01:15:49,260 --> 01:16:04,750
Yeah. I think overall, I mean, I just wanted to you switch on absolutely no agenda and you just join and then I'm going to be certified.

751
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:08,630
Yeah, well, I really like Mary here. I like it.

752
01:16:10,150 --> 01:16:18,970
Really? Yeah. And I'm not going to say or do it because I want to get it right.

753
01:16:19,930 --> 01:16:23,290
I don't think that's what it's like down here.

754
01:16:24,490 --> 01:16:27,740
I don't see that happening right now.

755
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:32,650
Yeah. Right.

756
01:16:33,870 --> 01:16:43,690
He was. So to say, I'm a student here, it looks like to do it.

757
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:49,600
So are you guys going to do business on Sunday?

758
01:16:49,630 --> 01:16:52,850
Yeah, well, I know that on Sunday.

759
01:16:53,790 --> 01:17:01,040
No. I'll tell you a little bit about how you're going to have to work.

760
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:14,580
I tell you, as I said to me, that this is one of the things that I do.

761
01:17:14,780 --> 01:17:25,460
This is the help of a band of volunteers three seven, nine, seven, eight one citizens on the side.

762
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:35,320
I'm going to have you in my village. Oh, yeah. Because it's like, well, I'll have a man.

763
01:17:35,640 --> 01:17:40,310
Did you go do that on the ground? Yeah, I think I'll go.

764
01:17:40,310 --> 01:17:47,140
I think that's a good one to get over there. I will not be able to put any parts of my vehicle that are going to make it.

765
01:17:47,330 --> 01:17:52,190
So I'm just going to do it from the morning. Okay, now we go.

766
01:17:56,560 --> 01:18:12,680
You have. I have got to deal with all this and ask have said, where are you going to be able to do the intervention about this?

767
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:20,970
I love the. I know. It doesn't actually go from there.

768
01:18:21,150 --> 01:18:27,510
Yeah. Right before I was like, yeah, I have a satellite.

769
01:18:28,410 --> 01:18:29,640
I just have it for certain people.

770
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:40,260
I really haven't lived to tell you about this, but I think it's important that I know I want to really get it right.

771
01:18:41,160 --> 01:18:51,480
Do you like it now? So I think to myself not to bring this up to my family.

772
01:18:53,250 --> 01:18:57,700
Yes. It's funny how I felt this way.

773
01:18:57,880 --> 01:19:13,400
You know, you can do that and that's the difference. But then you just come back and go, I love John, just like all humans, traditionally I like.

774
01:19:15,990 --> 01:19:26,100
Well, if you go to the last two years because I've been doing it quite well,

775
01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:41,160
that's not really you I fears this is why you want to get hot water, but I think it's worth it.

776
01:19:41,220 --> 01:19:44,850
Yeah, you can use it for it, actually.

777
01:19:45,610 --> 01:19:53,760
You get it for our else. Yeah, I have a word.

778
01:19:54,490 --> 01:19:59,340
I know it's out there. Are you going to regret going out with this for.

779
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:10,530
I haven't. I just want. What? This is not what we were expecting when we go to school.

780
01:20:10,540 --> 01:20:14,820
There isn't a school that I know. I'm interested in it.

781
01:20:17,310 --> 01:20:25,410
Did you really want to know anything about his poems?

782
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:31,030
Yes. Well, turned into a convenience store, but you will not hear him.

783
01:20:33,020 --> 01:20:45,900
I sure. As I said, he's afraid of what he said, actually, where he says, you know, I don't know.

784
01:20:50,270 --> 01:20:53,410
But I think that's.

785
01:20:54,450 --> 01:21:03,680
Yeah, you probably have somebody there in your dreams don't really know about dealing with thought automatic one.

786
01:21:03,690 --> 01:21:07,050
Yeah but somebody like hide this corner calling shots.

787
01:21:07,530 --> 01:21:20,220
What are the vending machines? Because so many hours ago and I have been in startup for almost.

788
01:21:22,070 --> 01:21:26,190
So that's it.

789
01:21:29,430 --> 01:21:35,790
But so is this. Lastly, they have gotten all put the materials.

790
01:21:36,180 --> 01:21:43,130
Absolutely. Even better that it is.

791
01:21:45,990 --> 01:21:54,920
So it doesn't matter whether we like it or not.

792
01:21:54,930 --> 01:22:02,840
People like Bloomberg's had a lot of different reasons.

793
01:22:02,850 --> 01:22:07,980
They got suits, and however, it's just the time of thing.

794
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:39,010
I think it's not just me, but I think what's going on here is that people are like, Hey, man, I know this is happening.

795
01:22:39,630 --> 01:22:44,500
I mean, I put a lot of people in the United States like every day.

796
01:22:45,950 --> 01:22:53,920
I hope it's not because I don't want.

797
01:22:56,390 --> 01:23:06,840
And I'm reading the breakfast table and you can fool me now because you didn't

798
01:23:07,010 --> 01:23:18,660
go to the food market or did you go downtown for lunch because they were here?

799
01:23:19,320 --> 01:23:22,690
No, no, no. You just get a little more exposure to this.

800
01:23:22,710 --> 01:23:26,160
A lot of them just like every day, like maybe they.

801
01:23:26,160 --> 01:23:42,920
No, no. I just looked online. I got really excited for them because I at one point I didn't they I just you know, because you just know.

802
01:23:43,050 --> 01:23:55,950
Is there lately. Yeah. Except that I, you know, like I know pretty well they do other things too.

803
01:23:56,470 --> 01:24:04,290
Yes. Well, I don't know. I was like, yeah, broccoli, cheddar soup.

804
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:09,300
You know, they require. Oh, I, I get there.

805
01:24:09,640 --> 01:24:14,610
I don't know. I'm saying that that's something that they can make for it is.

806
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:19,430
Right. Yeah. But that's why I live in our high school.

807
01:24:19,710 --> 01:24:41,820
That's a lot better than where he's like, okay, I used that and I went, Oh, it's, you know, we've got to make something else just because, like, I.

808
01:24:43,950 --> 01:24:48,160
Yeah. Yeah, that's get.

809
01:24:50,900 --> 01:24:55,370
I don't know. I mean, I don't know.

810
01:24:55,790 --> 01:25:00,460
I think everything is really scary.

811
01:25:02,830 --> 01:25:11,830
I about and I think that that kind of like, I, i, i.

812
01:25:20,930 --> 01:25:28,810
So I haven't been able, like.

813
01:25:32,430 --> 01:25:40,090
Correct. Yeah.

814
01:25:40,150 --> 01:25:44,320
I mean, I don't want to get fooled again.

815
01:25:48,250 --> 01:25:53,790
And I look at my ignorance.

816
01:25:53,980 --> 01:26:00,430
I mean, there's. Okay.

817
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:09,690
About the band.

818
01:26:15,130 --> 01:26:25,310
I want to make that decision.

819
01:26:31,330 --> 01:26:38,720
Oh. Yeah, you're right.

820
01:26:39,340 --> 01:26:49,080
You're right. It's. We're bit weird for my.

821
01:26:49,620 --> 01:26:55,390
It's. Beautiful people.

822
01:27:02,140 --> 01:27:05,890
I met in person.

823
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:19,410
You know, I mean, it's you know, it's the wrong idea here to do it.

824
01:27:20,710 --> 01:27:28,650
And I have to tell you that this is not going to be.

825
01:27:32,900 --> 01:27:42,670
She could be very important for people.

826
01:27:43,300 --> 01:27:51,000
I was like some of my friends.

827
01:27:54,590 --> 01:28:05,030
In my book. I make that like I said, there is that okay.

828
01:28:09,290 --> 01:28:18,850
And the other thing is that, you know, I think.

829
01:28:20,580 --> 01:28:28,470
But at the moment, you're doing it for me.

830
01:28:28,890 --> 01:28:48,700
And I'm with the company. I know. You're gonna have to have some things that make me feel like I don't know if I'm okay.

831
01:28:52,360 --> 01:28:59,040
That's why I cared about me.

832
01:28:59,700 --> 01:29:04,090
And I was like, Oh, yeah, right.

833
01:29:04,990 --> 01:29:28,600
Yeah. I sort of feel that we're not in search of it now or that my mom was like,

834
01:29:29,620 --> 01:29:40,720
Oh, sweetie, this one from Alabama, you know, either go to be a millionaire.

835
01:29:41,050 --> 01:29:52,930
And I know right at the top of my list, it was all this stuff.

836
01:29:52,930 --> 01:30:06,030
I mean, like I learned about, like, somebody. So they don't know how many of you have that kind of like, you know, both parents.

837
01:30:06,100 --> 01:30:19,630
But I never really felt like I had a man that I would really like.

838
01:30:19,780 --> 01:30:23,469
Right. I mean, we're looking at it right here.

839
01:30:23,470 --> 01:30:26,500
I mean, for me, I feel much better.

840
01:30:26,500 --> 01:30:48,190
Buster Keaton, my dad. But I guess we're not trying to say, oh, yeah, that's like they're going to come out and I know I shouldn't have that.

841
01:30:49,030 --> 01:30:51,550
Yeah, Charlie was he was like, Oh, I'm so thrilled.

842
01:30:51,670 --> 01:31:03,880
And you're trying to say, yeah, just parents are going to agree, but then we'll do something, then we'll get there right here.

843
01:31:04,660 --> 01:31:08,290
And how do you think that works? All right, folks, um,

844
01:31:09,490 --> 01:31:15,219
I got to point into the doctor regarding the whole way we had been figuring out how we were going to coordinate this this afternoon.

845
01:31:15,220 --> 01:31:19,299
I figured since now, we're we're kind of shifting that. You're talking about community context.

846
01:31:19,300 --> 01:31:21,370
You're talking about policing that sort of interaction.

847
01:31:21,370 --> 01:31:28,480
Again, thinking about safety or violence, an injury that happens at multiple levels, across multiple interactions, across identities.

848
01:31:28,790 --> 01:31:32,140
Now, now we're talking about a context that is very near and dear to my heart.

849
01:31:32,380 --> 01:31:41,200
When I when we started thinking about schools and how schools are playing or have a role in the violence and experiences of our young people,

850
01:31:41,470 --> 01:31:43,420
which is going to have a direct relation to safety.

851
01:31:43,630 --> 01:31:55,690
I'm very excited to welcome Dr. John for all the way from New York City, and I'm sure that it's nice again.

852
01:31:55,690 --> 01:32:01,569
Our class is focused on the designing and informing of injury related interventions,

853
01:32:01,570 --> 01:32:06,070
so we think about the many ways that we could be intervening in the lives of young people

854
01:32:06,760 --> 01:32:10,870
or older adults and all these different kinds of things that we have to consider.

855
01:32:11,140 --> 01:32:14,660
So we're very I'm very excited about this case particular, you know,

856
01:32:14,680 --> 01:32:20,620
we talked about last couple of weeks that can be difficult to prospectively assign people to an injury condition.

857
01:32:21,730 --> 01:32:25,690
So think about school violence and mass shootings in that way. And I will turn it over to Dr. John.

858
01:32:25,690 --> 01:32:29,649
Thank you so much for joining us. Thank you for having me. It's such a pleasure to be here.

859
01:32:29,650 --> 01:32:34,010
I had my student for a little and Damien Clay missing them today.

860
01:32:34,040 --> 01:32:39,880
Nice to be here. And they were like, so, but they're in good hands, so it's okay.

861
01:32:41,260 --> 01:32:43,329
So I'm so thrilled to be here.

862
01:32:43,330 --> 01:32:51,459
And I what I'm actually going to do today is talk a little bit about a study that I am co-leading the Dr. kinds of on as well.

863
01:32:51,460 --> 01:32:56,710
And we're working together to figure out and help hopefully answer some questions that we really need to know more about.

864
01:32:57,850 --> 01:33:01,750
But please type in and I will talk more than I don't even.

865
01:33:01,780 --> 01:33:04,990
How long do I go there when we go? All the time in the world.

866
01:33:05,540 --> 01:33:07,599
All right. I'll start again. Fig. 21.

867
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:18,459
The question I am I am keeping my mouth kind of as a cave of my adorable but 37 year old, you know, kisses me on the map like every day.

868
01:33:18,460 --> 01:33:22,300
So I caught his non-covid cold and I just want to make sure not pass anything on.

869
01:33:22,300 --> 01:33:31,630
So. All right. So this thing that I'm talking about today really only possible because we have this really wonderful group of people who help.

870
01:33:31,900 --> 01:33:34,990
Not just not our help, not only help are helping do the study right now,

871
01:33:34,990 --> 01:33:38,979
but help us think about the design of the study, which is really what I'm going to talk about today.

872
01:33:38,980 --> 01:33:45,460
It's a Charlie Brand. This is the MP along with me on the study where this wonderful group representing lots of different disciplines,

873
01:33:46,060 --> 01:33:50,230
which I also love about this field in the area where your study something like school gun violence.

874
01:33:51,190 --> 01:33:59,620
So you bring together criminologists and epidemiologists and school health researchers and my two students, Jenny is our former classroom teacher.

875
01:33:59,620 --> 01:34:06,519
So I really think it's I love having that kind of perspective as we think about the problems,

876
01:34:06,520 --> 01:34:11,530
because we need that to better understand not just like how you prevent violence in and of itself,

877
01:34:11,530 --> 01:34:17,780
but what the process of preventing violence may or may not do to kids, to teachers, to the community at large.

878
01:34:17,780 --> 01:34:23,030
So that sort of a lens is something I think a lot about in my work, right?

879
01:34:23,230 --> 01:34:28,719
So I don't really need the slides, but this is to help me kind of not go on to,

880
01:34:28,720 --> 01:34:33,640
to my the I guess to contextualize this and you guys can tell me if you already know this.

881
01:34:34,420 --> 01:34:39,610
So I'll just go through some of this briefly. But school gun violence, of course, and my students always laugh.

882
01:34:39,610 --> 01:34:45,730
They say, we know, we know doctrine. Not everything is like doom and gloom and terrible.

883
01:34:46,060 --> 01:34:52,299
And here are the statistics to show why that is. But gun violence as a problem is really a crisis, a public health crisis.

884
01:34:52,300 --> 01:35:00,129
I would actually call it an educational crisis of. Well, but anyway, but over the past six, seven years,

885
01:35:00,130 --> 01:35:07,270
there's been a notable uptick in school shootings and the types of school shootings that we're interested in this particular work or not,

886
01:35:08,590 --> 01:35:12,129
if there's a gun in a school and it accidentally goes off or something like that.

887
01:35:12,130 --> 01:35:14,620
But we're really talking about intentional gun violence.

888
01:35:14,620 --> 01:35:20,349
So by that I mean someone who comes into a school and in this case we're talking particularly about public schools.

889
01:35:20,350 --> 01:35:28,360
The Capital Public School across the U.S. is someone who might go into a school with the intent of causing harm with the fire.

890
01:35:29,170 --> 01:35:34,180
And there's some really I don't always use the term like wonderful.

891
01:35:34,180 --> 01:35:36,190
And I should add, because it's such a sad topic,

892
01:35:36,190 --> 01:35:45,069
but there is really wonderful rich data that The Washington Post pretty regularly collects to document not just how many school shootings there are,

893
01:35:45,070 --> 01:35:49,570
but how many children, by extension, have been exposed to that kind of gun violence.

894
01:35:49,570 --> 01:35:54,640
And so I go to that website all the time. John Cox of The Washington Post and his colleague maintain it.

895
01:35:54,850 --> 01:35:59,440
But every time I go to the website, that number goes up. It's like a really disturbing figure to see.

896
01:35:59,830 --> 01:36:06,879
But the last time I was there was probably about three days ago or so it said something like 311,000 kids since Columbine,

897
01:36:06,880 --> 01:36:10,280
which was when I was in high school. So we don't talk.

898
01:36:10,450 --> 01:36:20,140
But in 1989, so the past 22 years or so, there have been about 311,000 children exposed to gun violence just in school.

899
01:36:20,600 --> 01:36:23,509
That can't be possible. That's an extraordinary number.

900
01:36:23,510 --> 01:36:28,839
And we think about like and this is something I think is really important to talk about in this context as well,

901
01:36:28,840 --> 01:36:31,900
is not just like how many people are shot or killed with a firearm.

902
01:36:33,070 --> 01:36:39,490
And of course, that's important. But like all the people that are that impacted, right, their friends, their teachers, their siblings.

903
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:45,010
So when we think about children and how they're growing and their health and their wellbeing,

904
01:36:45,310 --> 01:36:50,350
it's not just that kind of the way we tend to do this in this very like epidemiological way,

905
01:36:50,350 --> 01:36:57,100
like how many injured, how many killed, but also and importantly, what was that exposure to that kind of violence and how many were exposed?

906
01:36:57,610 --> 01:37:03,940
So I think that figure of like hundreds of thousands of kids being exposed to this kind of violence in some form in a school,

907
01:37:04,330 --> 01:37:07,840
a school which should be. Right, a place that is safe.

908
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:11,799
And we should feel like I mean, I had the privilege of growing up.

909
01:37:11,800 --> 01:37:18,250
I went to a regular public school in upstate New York, but I never once up until I actually call in might happen when I was in 10th grade.

910
01:37:19,480 --> 01:37:24,130
Never it never occurred to me that school was that was an unsafe space.

911
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:31,990
But my seven year old just did his fifth now lockdown drill of his lifetime last week.

912
01:37:32,830 --> 01:37:38,590
And I had a lot of thoughts about that. Okay. So but my point is to say all this is there were kids are right now where they're growing up.

913
01:37:38,590 --> 01:37:46,569
And this is just a different generate different a different the safety of schools right now is just it's just very different.

914
01:37:46,570 --> 01:37:49,600
And it's something that also I think can be addressed and fixed. Okay.

915
01:37:52,160 --> 01:37:58,629
Copenhagen happened and with it, gun violence. Now, I've been I'm sure maybe you've talked about it in this class in other spaces,

916
01:37:58,630 --> 01:38:05,980
but the onset of COVID in the United States came alongside a huge uptick in gun sales.

917
01:38:06,130 --> 01:38:12,670
Really interesting. I don't have this a really interesting figure that The New York Times put together, but it is kind of remarkable.

918
01:38:13,960 --> 01:38:21,220
You know, I forget how many there were pre-COVID, but now there are over 400 million firearms in circulation in the United States.

919
01:38:22,030 --> 01:38:26,450
There's that's more guns than there are people. Right. That's a lot of it's a lot of firearms.

920
01:38:26,450 --> 01:38:31,480
But we have to figure out how do we coexist safely with these?

921
01:38:31,730 --> 01:38:34,850
Weapons. And I think that's something we're contending with.

922
01:38:36,770 --> 01:38:42,319
For my colleagues here at the University of Michigan has shown that gun

923
01:38:42,320 --> 01:38:45,590
violence is now the leading cause of death among children in the United States,

924
01:38:45,590 --> 01:38:51,200
which is a remarkable statistic in a really devastating one.

925
01:38:52,310 --> 01:38:55,070
And as I was saying, these indirect forms of gun violence,

926
01:38:55,220 --> 01:39:06,320
having a friend or a loved one or a parent or someone experience gun violence certainly has an impact on children as well, and understandably so.

927
01:39:06,350 --> 01:39:10,760
So nothing I've seen here is particularly remarkable, but all providing some context.

928
01:39:12,770 --> 01:39:20,509
And then this last statistic here or last sort of comment is that, you know, the ways in which we talk about school shootings in particular,

929
01:39:20,510 --> 01:39:31,520
we focus a lot, I think, on sorry, the mass shootings that happen in mostly white and rural or suburban areas.

930
01:39:32,180 --> 01:39:39,920
And those are important and we should talk about them. But the data are very clear that gun violence disproportionately impacts children of color.

931
01:39:42,530 --> 01:39:45,600
Sorry, I'm going to do this. I'm going to be annoyed by politics. Okay.

932
01:39:46,470 --> 01:39:54,920
So gun violence is a problem, whether the picture of my face at the beginning, because when you got to see what I look like when I'm.

933
01:39:54,920 --> 01:40:06,950
No, you've got me. Okay. So gun violence is a problem that's been persisting for such a long time and it's getting worse.

934
01:40:10,070 --> 01:40:15,190
So schools have understandably had to respond, right?

935
01:40:15,800 --> 01:40:22,340
So schools have said, well, we have to do something right. We have to do something in our ability to try and address this.

936
01:40:22,370 --> 01:40:29,000
Now, how many of you remember that your K-12 school environment was like, largely.

937
01:40:29,330 --> 01:40:38,270
Right. You know, it was maybe, hopefully fun and nurturing and all of that, but also kind of chaotic.

938
01:40:38,270 --> 01:40:48,679
Like, I come, my husband dropped by or something better off at school this morning and he said he got there and a bunch of kids had,

939
01:40:48,680 --> 01:40:50,440
you know, that like silly string stuff like that.

940
01:40:50,480 --> 01:40:55,520
Like, anyway, they were like they had found these kids in bed and it was like all over the schoolyard and he was like,

941
01:40:55,520 --> 01:40:56,810
So that happened at eight this morning.

942
01:40:56,840 --> 01:41:04,280
And I was like, okay, so school buildings are chaotic and teachers are just these remarkable individuals that do so much, right?

943
01:41:04,280 --> 01:41:11,780
They do so much not just to teach and to educate kids and to meet all of these, like curricular standards and testing standards,

944
01:41:12,500 --> 01:41:18,979
but also so much to attend to the well-being of every kid in their class, which is such a gift.

945
01:41:18,980 --> 01:41:29,120
Right? So all that we ask of teachers is already above and beyond all that we ask of our school leaders already above and beyond.

946
01:41:29,150 --> 01:41:39,050
Okay. So given all that, it's not like we have time to say, in addition to all that, we're going to ask teachers to like,

947
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:43,850
do schools really have the time and energy and resources to be solving this crisis, I guess, is the question.

948
01:41:44,450 --> 01:41:53,749
And of course not. So instead, what schools have had to been had to do and they've been forced to do is really think about, well, what could we do?

949
01:41:53,750 --> 01:41:59,650
That would be something at the school level that would actually maybe do something in the moment of a violent act.

950
01:41:59,660 --> 01:41:59,870
Right.

951
01:41:59,870 --> 01:42:11,510
And that as a result of that, we see metal detectors, we see these active shooter drills that now happen in about 95% of schools across the country.

952
01:42:12,080 --> 01:42:25,670
We see locker locker searches, person searches, just all sorts of different kinds of strategies, threat reporting system.

953
01:42:26,870 --> 01:42:33,019
There are a few of these strategies that do have some effectiveness or evidence guiding their effectiveness.

954
01:42:33,020 --> 01:42:42,530
But by and large, oh, arming teachers. My favorite of all the ones like really I always look I think sometimes about and I say chaos in a good way.

955
01:42:42,530 --> 01:42:46,339
It's not a bad thing. Children should be joyful and noisy and play.

956
01:42:46,340 --> 01:42:52,040
That's really important to their development that we've ever anyone's ever spent time in a kindergarten classroom.

957
01:42:52,670 --> 01:42:58,850
And, you know, with that energy in life to say that then the teacher also has to be armed with a loaded firearm.

958
01:42:59,390 --> 01:43:05,480
And in a moment, in the moment of a potentially violent act, use it accurately to that.

959
01:43:05,750 --> 01:43:16,040
I mean, the expectation, like I say, we're placing on our school personnel to really respond to this issue is is it's just it's too much.

960
01:43:16,160 --> 01:43:21,590
Right. And the challenge here is that most of these strategies that I've just mentioned,

961
01:43:21,590 --> 01:43:30,960
you hear and there's I'll talk more about some specifics and a little bit sorry, this sounds way worse than it actually is, I feel, to go to.

962
01:43:32,450 --> 01:43:39,200
In Norway, where the there's no evidence of even the fact that it means we're spending

963
01:43:39,200 --> 01:43:44,509
a lot of time and energy and money implementing these different strategies,

964
01:43:44,510 --> 01:43:47,780
and we don't even know if any of them will work. Right.

965
01:43:47,790 --> 01:43:54,140
We don't know if these are effective. We don't know if they work better together or individually.

966
01:43:55,040 --> 01:43:58,069
We don't necessarily know if they work better in certain kinds of schools.

967
01:43:58,070 --> 01:44:01,070
Like my little one goes to school in Manhattan.

968
01:44:01,070 --> 01:44:08,060
So he's like a no. I don't even know how to describe his school building, but he has one school building that is actually three schools,

969
01:44:08,090 --> 01:44:14,390
very different from how I grew up, which was like more of a almost like a campus looking school in a in a suburb.

970
01:44:14,840 --> 01:44:20,060
So we have all these kinds of questions about these different kinds of strategies.

971
01:44:20,390 --> 01:44:23,210
We don't know if they work. A lot of them are quite expensive.

972
01:44:24,200 --> 01:44:29,890
The arming teachers in particular is very interesting to me because there are some estimates that if

973
01:44:29,900 --> 01:44:37,790
we just are one teacher in every school or one staff member in every school in the United States,

974
01:44:38,450 --> 01:44:41,630
we would eat up something like 30% of our federal education budget.

975
01:44:42,020 --> 01:44:45,170
So would I say these are expensive. These are potentially very expensive interventions.

976
01:44:46,130 --> 01:44:47,030
We don't know if they work.

977
01:44:47,660 --> 01:44:55,510
And right now there's about 100,000 K through 12 public schools across the U.S. serving 100 million kids or 51 million kids.

978
01:44:55,510 --> 01:44:58,909
Sorry, just double that amount. 900,000 school is 51 million.

979
01:44:58,910 --> 01:45:07,940
That's a lot of kids, right? So whatever it is we are choosing to do, whether it's legally required by the state or the federal government,

980
01:45:08,150 --> 01:45:12,440
whether it's something schools are choosing or school districts are choosing to implement on their own regardless,

981
01:45:12,650 --> 01:45:15,650
regardless of what is happening in that context.

982
01:45:15,650 --> 01:45:20,390
At the end of the day, these are things that should be implemented with some evidence say,

983
01:45:20,420 --> 01:45:23,230
all right, well, if we're going to do this, here's why we're doing that.

984
01:45:23,240 --> 01:45:30,620
We're doing it because if we do this, we know it's more likely to help us determine violence or what have you.

985
01:45:32,990 --> 01:45:40,819
Okay, I'm going to keep going. So our sort of team came together over the course of it, took us a long time to get the funding,

986
01:45:40,820 --> 01:45:46,070
but over the course of a few years and we said, okay, well, we have all these interventions, right?

987
01:45:46,460 --> 01:45:50,030
All the school safety policy, the tactics that are being implemented.

988
01:45:51,290 --> 01:45:55,820
We don't know if they work. We don't know if they're necessarily effective at deterring gun violence.

989
01:45:56,810 --> 01:46:00,530
Schools are implementing strategies without a lot of guidance.

990
01:46:00,830 --> 01:46:05,180
Right. Without a lot of support. Well, let's try to answer some of these questions.

991
01:46:05,180 --> 01:46:06,470
Right. Let's try to figure this out.

992
01:46:07,110 --> 01:46:13,060
I, Charlie and I like to joke that this grant came about because of me ranting in an email one day because I was like,

993
01:46:13,070 --> 01:46:17,260
so sick of reading about these things. And I was like, Can you believe this?

994
01:46:17,270 --> 01:46:22,819
And he was like, Well, what if we try to study it? An answer, which is the way we're productive, want to, you know, do that?

995
01:46:22,820 --> 01:46:27,649
So it's like, I'm not going to read this word for word per se.

996
01:46:27,650 --> 01:46:32,930
But what I've shared here are so when you write a grant or you get funded,

997
01:46:34,310 --> 01:46:38,780
you usually have to come up with something called a set of specific AIDS or like research questions.

998
01:46:40,460 --> 01:46:45,860
So in our school, what we did is we said, well, let's and I'm really going to focus today on the first one,

999
01:46:45,860 --> 01:46:50,000
but I included all of them here so we could talk about them if there was interest.

1000
01:46:52,490 --> 01:47:01,850
But what we said was, all right, let's figure out how we determine the total number and specific types of safety tactics

1001
01:47:02,330 --> 01:47:08,630
and policies that are associated with this kind of intentional gun violence in schools.

1002
01:47:09,110 --> 01:47:14,879
Okay. And then we said and this is sort of like a secondary, but I think it's sort of interesting.

1003
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:21,680
And what if we also look at associations with school discipline outcomes?

1004
01:47:23,660 --> 01:47:33,950
So there is, you know, some interesting research over the criminalizing of school spaces and kids who, you know,

1005
01:47:33,950 --> 01:47:40,370
if we are using some of these safety strategies as a way to be more punitive in how we discipline kids,

1006
01:47:41,620 --> 01:47:46,060
and this tends to happen in schools that predominantly serve children of color, for example.

1007
01:47:46,070 --> 01:47:50,150
So it's there are some there are some really, I think, important systemic questions here.

1008
01:47:50,840 --> 01:47:57,169
And then our third question said, well, let's try also to look at some of these differences in teasing out by location.

1009
01:47:57,170 --> 01:48:00,290
Right, school of Manhattan versus the school. You know, it's a well,

1010
01:48:00,710 --> 01:48:07,790
let's let's try to tease out some of those demographic differences and see if we can better understand what's working better or maybe not better.

1011
01:48:07,790 --> 01:48:16,460
Right, in certain areas. Now, a lot of this is like, well, don't you already know, like arming teachers is a really bad idea?

1012
01:48:16,490 --> 01:48:20,640
Well, in theory, that would be my hypothesis. But we don't actually know, right?

1013
01:48:20,660 --> 01:48:22,670
We don't actually know what works and what doesn't.

1014
01:48:23,030 --> 01:48:30,140
And like I was saying, we don't we also don't know what works well together or separately or if it's a combination of strategies or not.

1015
01:48:30,560 --> 01:48:36,660
So there's lots of. Questions here that we're trying to figure out. So we said, all right, let's let's try it.

1016
01:48:36,690 --> 01:48:42,690
Let's try and answer this. To some degree. That would be reasonable. All right, everyone, you can hear me.

1017
01:48:42,690 --> 01:48:47,460
Okay? I'm sorry. This is like, probably so. Okay, you're very patient.

1018
01:48:49,650 --> 01:48:56,090
So to do this, what we said was, let's use something called a case control study design approach.

1019
01:48:56,100 --> 01:49:05,129
And what I wanted to spend a little bit of time talking about is that over the next few minutes is what a case control study design is,

1020
01:49:05,130 --> 01:49:08,490
and maybe we can answer some questions.

1021
01:49:11,130 --> 01:49:16,140
Okay. So by definition, I try to do too many definitions,

1022
01:49:16,140 --> 01:49:25,500
but I didn't want to share this with you because I think this gives like a good, uh, I think I put on the next study slide.

1023
01:49:26,640 --> 01:49:32,190
Okay, I'm going to talk about this first, but I just think that's interesting. So before I tell you what a case control study design is,

1024
01:49:33,240 --> 01:49:39,060
I want to underscore that there's a long history of case control study design being used in public health.

1025
01:49:39,660 --> 01:49:42,870
So the first side, I think this is really interesting,

1026
01:49:42,870 --> 01:49:50,520
but the first scientific link between smoking and lung cancer, between aspirin and race syndrome,

1027
01:49:51,180 --> 01:50:03,990
between tampon use and toxic shock syndrome, uh, vaccinations and um, encephalitis, gun possession of homicide, lots of other health issues.

1028
01:50:04,650 --> 01:50:14,000
Some of the most, like critical associations that we have seen in public health, were officially established in the evidence via a case control study.

1029
01:50:14,230 --> 01:50:19,670
So they're important it's an important tool that's been used that actually been used quite a bit in education work.

1030
01:50:19,680 --> 01:50:21,899
In fact, one of the earlier that's the case,

1031
01:50:21,900 --> 01:50:29,180
the prosthetic design as a design actually was founded in the educational science of the world, which I recently learned.

1032
01:50:29,190 --> 01:50:33,990
I thought that was kind of cool. So okay, so I want to go back to the slide in a second, but.

1033
01:50:34,860 --> 01:50:40,860
Oh, okay. Okay. All right.

1034
01:50:41,730 --> 01:50:45,570
So what are the case control study design?

1035
01:50:45,570 --> 01:50:49,979
So I got like I tried to do two really definitions, but I just want to walk us through a little bit about what it is.

1036
01:50:49,980 --> 01:50:58,650
So typically a case control study design essentially says, let's compare patients.

1037
01:50:58,650 --> 01:51:02,160
It's a very so if we were to think about this in a very light clinical fact,

1038
01:51:03,240 --> 01:51:11,730
let's compare patients who have a disease with patients who do not have that disease.

1039
01:51:12,300 --> 01:51:14,970
And let's look back retrospectively.

1040
01:51:15,040 --> 01:51:27,810
I'll come back to all these terms in a second to compare how frequently the exposure to any risk factor in one group compares to that of the other.

1041
01:51:27,870 --> 01:51:35,940
Okay. So what does all this mean essentially? So if you think about like smoking and lung cancer, this is I think that's a nice example.

1042
01:51:37,710 --> 01:51:45,240
If you were to look at all individuals who have lung cancer, you could and let's say that with your sample, right?

1043
01:51:45,240 --> 01:51:50,430
Let's say you conducted a study and you were like, I'm going to try to understand what are the causes of lung cancer?

1044
01:51:50,880 --> 01:51:55,200
And let's say your study, what sampled 100 patients?

1045
01:51:55,200 --> 01:51:57,420
They all had they all had lung cancer, a different form.

1046
01:51:58,140 --> 01:52:02,640
You could do a survey, you could ask them questions or you could look at their medical history.

1047
01:52:03,030 --> 01:52:11,040
You could probably alert a lot of. Right. About what these folks with lung cancer, what their experiences or lived experience or medical history.

1048
01:52:11,550 --> 01:52:15,390
It would tell you something, but it would be unclear.

1049
01:52:15,390 --> 01:52:24,960
You wouldn't know just by that alone. You wouldn't really be able to tell us or say anything meaningful if you about

1050
01:52:25,560 --> 01:52:30,000
whether or not their experience differs from folks who've never had lung cancer.

1051
01:52:30,300 --> 01:52:40,050
Like how do we know, right, that what your sample of lung cancer patients is experiencing is different from those without lung cancer?

1052
01:52:40,110 --> 01:52:44,340
How do we know that unless you actually looked at people who haven't had lung cancer?

1053
01:52:44,730 --> 01:52:51,630
This seems really obvious, right? But you would not believe the amount of times and this happens.

1054
01:52:51,870 --> 01:52:54,599
This I mean, this just this happens quite easily.

1055
01:52:54,600 --> 01:53:02,459
It's very natural to look at the affected population and draw a lot of conclusions from that alone with a case control study design says,

1056
01:53:02,460 --> 01:53:06,480
all right, yeah, we want to know what's happening in the lung cancer patients.

1057
01:53:06,990 --> 01:53:15,840
But to really definitively understand whether or not risk is higher or lower in that particular group due to a given factor,

1058
01:53:16,140 --> 01:53:18,290
we should look at the people who are very similar,

1059
01:53:18,300 --> 01:53:24,390
otherwise maybe in terms of their gender or where they live or their economic status or what have you.

1060
01:53:25,560 --> 01:53:30,720
But let's say they're similar. Let's try to draw some four persons between those who have lung cancer and those who don't.

1061
01:53:30,990 --> 01:53:37,340
And then you can start to look at, oh, well, these folks are smoking and these folks are doing this or not this.

1062
01:53:37,350 --> 01:53:42,569
If you get you get a sense of, okay, here's the similarity and here are the differences that kind of make sense to me.

1063
01:53:42,570 --> 01:53:51,240
I would say that essentially what you need and what a case control study does is it allows for something called it comparator group.

1064
01:53:51,420 --> 01:53:58,470
And that comparator group is so important for actually helping us establish in a clear way comparisons comparison.

1065
01:53:59,190 --> 01:54:00,360
I say this all the time.

1066
01:54:00,360 --> 01:54:10,799
So in my previous life, before I went to graduate school, I studied biomedical engineering, which by which is fine but not that interested.

1067
01:54:10,800 --> 01:54:14,910
And now I'm very glad I do what I do right now. But when I was an undergrad,

1068
01:54:14,910 --> 01:54:23,370
I spent a whole lot of time working in this lab and my job as an undergrad was

1069
01:54:23,370 --> 01:54:28,639
to go and I would have to feed and grow these cells in these petri dishes.

1070
01:54:28,640 --> 01:54:32,430
So I would like and I had to do it at these really regular intervals. I would be like 11 at night.

1071
01:54:32,430 --> 01:54:39,659
I'd be like going from my dorm over to this lab and like putting in the thing and doing doing all this nonsense with these cells.

1072
01:54:39,660 --> 01:54:47,720
And I would help the P.I. of this lab, like, run these experiments, these cells very different from kids in a school.

1073
01:54:47,760 --> 01:54:50,850
Right. It was like a very controlled environment.

1074
01:54:51,210 --> 01:54:58,260
So these are all things where I could control all the conditions, every single thing about these cells and these feature dishes I could manage.

1075
01:54:58,280 --> 01:55:01,590
They lived in this incubator. They control the temperature.

1076
01:55:02,400 --> 01:55:03,959
Everything about that was very thick.

1077
01:55:03,960 --> 01:55:13,410
So it was very easy when you're working with these little cells in these petri dishes to control for things that might impact what's happening inside.

1078
01:55:13,740 --> 01:55:18,570
Because I'm with in charge of that. You can't do that with the kid or with the school, right?

1079
01:55:18,600 --> 01:55:19,890
You can't do that with people.

1080
01:55:20,400 --> 01:55:25,380
So one of the beautiful parts about doing research with people is you get the joy of getting to work with people or in school.

1081
01:55:25,800 --> 01:55:29,970
But the hard part is, and I can testify with my seven year old,

1082
01:55:30,630 --> 01:55:33,959
there are one seven year old very different from another and lots of things that

1083
01:55:33,960 --> 01:55:37,980
impact them and their in their day to day and even school though that ecosystem.

1084
01:55:37,980 --> 01:55:41,120
Right. There's so much variability from school is worthwhile.

1085
01:55:41,430 --> 01:55:46,139
Right. The quality of of a teacher and the resources, etc., etc.

1086
01:55:46,140 --> 01:55:47,970
So there's so many moving parts.

1087
01:55:48,900 --> 01:55:57,750
A case control study design is really important and good for working with people and our systems because it allows us to try and say,

1088
01:55:57,750 --> 01:56:03,810
All right, we know there's a lot of differences from individual to individual, from person, from person to school, from school to school.

1089
01:56:04,770 --> 01:56:10,050
So in this study design, we're going to do our best to try and account for the fact that, of course, there's differences.

1090
01:56:10,380 --> 01:56:16,650
But even if we account for some of those differences, can we draw some meaningful comparisons and try to come up with some solutions?

1091
01:56:16,650 --> 01:56:20,340
So that's sort of how I like to think about case control. Study design is like an idea.

1092
01:56:20,370 --> 01:56:27,420
Now what's also interesting is that case control studies are observational, so you're not intervening on that.

1093
01:56:27,450 --> 01:56:31,050
So I use the term for retrospective, but essentially you're safe.

1094
01:56:31,770 --> 01:56:35,550
The thing already happened, right? The person was already diagnosed with lung cancer.

1095
01:56:35,790 --> 01:56:41,940
The school shooting already happened to be the gun possession and the homicide already happened.

1096
01:56:41,970 --> 01:56:47,280
Whatever the outcome is of interest, it's already happened. So you're not waiting for something to happen.

1097
01:56:47,280 --> 01:56:52,590
It's just you're looking at it. You're saying this thing already happened to this person or to this school?

1098
01:56:53,700 --> 01:57:01,829
And I want to look back on a group of people or a group of schools, a given time period, and look at differences that way.

1099
01:57:01,830 --> 01:57:05,399
So it's kind of helpful because, you know, it's already happened.

1100
01:57:05,400 --> 01:57:08,879
And you can start to get a sense of, all right, who is my sample? So that's helpful.

1101
01:57:08,880 --> 01:57:18,390
From a measurement perspective, the goal really for case control is to retrospectively then determine the exposure to the risk

1102
01:57:18,390 --> 01:57:23,660
factor of interest from each of the two groups of individual your cases and your controls.

1103
01:57:24,640 --> 01:57:28,200
I'm going to talk through our study, so hopefully this will make more sense in a second.

1104
01:57:28,560 --> 01:57:30,540
Now, as I would say,

1105
01:57:30,750 --> 01:57:39,000
case control studies have been used quite a bit in public health already and lots of notable associations have emerged from that body of work.

1106
01:57:39,450 --> 01:57:42,150
And like I was saying, there's a number of benefits to this approach.

1107
01:57:42,160 --> 01:57:49,830
So one thing is that you actually need less time to do a case study because again, like I said, it's already happened.

1108
01:57:49,830 --> 01:57:56,210
You're not wait, you're not following people and saying, okay, I'm going to follow you for five years and see what happens and go from there.

1109
01:57:56,960 --> 01:57:58,140
This is already happened.

1110
01:57:58,140 --> 01:58:07,200
So you can you can kind of work with that is often it's useful as like an initial study to help establish an association to begin with.

1111
01:58:07,200 --> 01:58:12,359
So in the context of our study been helpful because there's so much we don't know, right?

1112
01:58:12,360 --> 01:58:17,280
In the context of school gun violence prevention, there's a lot we do know, but there's a lot we don't know.

1113
01:58:17,670 --> 01:58:21,990
So it's helpful to try and establish some initial associations.

1114
01:58:23,010 --> 01:58:28,550
It's also good for studying relatively rare conditions or diseases.

1115
01:58:28,580 --> 01:58:37,950
So my husband actually, he he saw this I was working on this the other day and he was like, well, school shootings are rare.

1116
01:58:39,540 --> 01:58:46,259
They are not rare in the sense of they happen with some frequency, but from an epidemiological perspective,

1117
01:58:46,260 --> 01:58:54,240
they're considered relatively rare events in the sense of there are lots of other conditions and diseases that happen with way more frequency.

1118
01:58:54,750 --> 01:58:59,400
That does not mean we don't want to stop them or address them or not spend time fixing it.

1119
01:58:59,760 --> 01:59:01,320
And in fact, it's a growing problem.

1120
01:59:01,620 --> 01:59:11,070
But I was like, he was like, you're going to explain to them that rare doesn't mean I will do it so the qualify that they here all.

1121
01:59:12,270 --> 01:59:17,250
The other thing that I think is a little interesting that was a little different about the study that we're doing right now.

1122
01:59:17,940 --> 01:59:18,540
Is that so?

1123
01:59:18,540 --> 01:59:26,040
As in the example that I've given and I keep coming back to the smoking one just because I think it's an easy one to paint a picture in your head,

1124
01:59:26,700 --> 01:59:32,580
but like lung cancer or what have you, these are all conditions that affect individuals, right?

1125
01:59:33,300 --> 01:59:42,270
The large majority of like I mean, the vast, vast majority of case control studies involve individual people as the unit of analysis.

1126
01:59:42,660 --> 01:59:50,250
So you're recruiting, you know, 100, 200, 800 lung cancer patients, Rader or whoever.

1127
01:59:51,210 --> 01:59:56,550
In our study, we've been using the school as a unit of analysis.

1128
01:59:57,180 --> 02:00:06,000
So in our case, we said. We are interested in whether a school has an experienced school shooting or not.

1129
02:00:06,360 --> 02:00:12,329
So instead of focusing on an individual person or a unit of analysis in our study of a school,

1130
02:00:12,330 --> 02:00:16,590
so that's a little bit of a different a little different from a traditional case control study.

1131
02:00:16,590 --> 02:00:21,360
But the same rule, same methods apply. That makes us sort of the way thing.

1132
02:00:22,710 --> 02:00:28,590
Okay. Okay. So what are we doing and how are we doing this?

1133
02:00:28,620 --> 02:00:32,120
So basically what we're doing, we're right now, we're like knee deep in this right now.

1134
02:00:32,130 --> 02:00:36,210
So this is where I'm like happy to answer questions or talk through this.

1135
02:00:37,290 --> 02:00:43,590
But essentially what we did is we said, all right, I think I mentioned at the beginning that school shootings have seen an uptick.

1136
02:00:43,800 --> 02:00:49,830
Basically starting around 2015, we started to see a pretty they were you know, school shootings have occurred for a long time.

1137
02:00:52,050 --> 02:00:59,430
They certainly since Columbine have gotten there's been, I would say, better data collection tracking some of this in different ways.

1138
02:01:01,950 --> 02:01:07,290
But we were interested in like, okay, there's been an uptick since 2015, so let's just use that as our starting point.

1139
02:01:07,740 --> 02:01:11,370
And then kind of in the middle of writing this crap, we wrote the, I don't know,

1140
02:01:11,370 --> 02:01:16,199
13 or whatever iteration of the grant we wrote that finally got the funny happened in the middle of COVID.

1141
02:01:16,200 --> 02:01:20,460
So we also realized, like everything, gun rules have gone up even more so during COVID.

1142
02:01:21,120 --> 02:01:27,720
So we said, All right, what if we were to take the time period, 2015 till, let's say 2023?

1143
02:01:27,870 --> 02:01:34,110
Okay. So we were a few years before COVID, a few years after COVID, but that gives us like a nice sort of chunk of time.

1144
02:01:35,130 --> 02:01:39,600
And let's look at how many schools, first of all, have experienced.

1145
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:48,810
An intentional shooting. And again, we focus on public schools trying to keep things a little bit consistent.

1146
02:01:49,350 --> 02:01:55,469
But how many schools have experienced a school shooting, an intentional school shooting during this time period?

1147
02:01:55,470 --> 02:01:59,220
Now, 2023 hasn't happened yet, obviously. So right now, we're just estimating.

1148
02:01:59,640 --> 02:02:04,780
But what we anticipated and we are absolutely going to exceed, which is really heartbreaking,

1149
02:02:04,800 --> 02:02:09,090
but we're going to exceed these numbers by a little bit at least.

1150
02:02:10,230 --> 02:02:16,020
But we estimated that there will be about 329 cases that meet our criteria.

1151
02:02:16,560 --> 02:02:17,570
That's a lot. Right.

1152
02:02:17,580 --> 02:02:27,160
So 329 schools that have experienced a school shooting, an intentional school shooting during the school day, during school hours or a school event.

1153
02:02:27,180 --> 02:02:35,790
So these are some of the criteria we've been talking through with our group. Basically, when kids are at school or doing a school event,

1154
02:02:36,180 --> 02:02:43,110
if an intentional shooting happened and there's lots of way we've been collecting this data and I'm happy to share more about that.

1155
02:02:44,400 --> 02:02:47,640
These are the schools that have been here for two years, and these are schools all over the U.S.

1156
02:02:47,940 --> 02:02:52,950
Okay. And one of the things actually are a lot of our project director is looking at right now

1157
02:02:52,950 --> 02:02:57,630
is doing a little bit of like looking to see are there where are all of these like?

1158
02:02:57,720 --> 02:03:06,060
Is there is there any pattern to the distribution there? But they're it's fairly random and they're all over the U.S. and at different levels,

1159
02:03:06,060 --> 02:03:12,960
not necessarily just high school where we have middle schools, we have elementary school all in all in the mix here.

1160
02:03:13,860 --> 02:03:19,770
So in our case, control study design, we said, all right, we have these these 329 cases.

1161
02:03:20,250 --> 02:03:24,409
All right. To design a case control study.

1162
02:03:24,410 --> 02:03:31,280
It means now well, who are controls? So let's say so I went to this high school in upstate New York.

1163
02:03:31,490 --> 02:03:38,900
Okay. So if that let's just say mosquito was one of our cases, I should pick a high school with a easier sounding name.

1164
02:03:39,800 --> 02:03:47,850
Anyway, but we'll just go with a control that it would be another high school also in New York State.

1165
02:03:47,870 --> 02:03:51,979
So it's important because gun laws vary from state to state.

1166
02:03:51,980 --> 02:03:53,270
So we want to keep that in mind.

1167
02:03:53,270 --> 02:03:59,629
Remember, if we go back to myself, are we trying to control we're trying to minimize the extraneous noise in our situation here.

1168
02:03:59,630 --> 02:04:10,340
In fact. So our controls are another school that happened, another so another school in the same state, a school of the same level.

1169
02:04:10,340 --> 02:04:13,639
So like a high school, middle school or elementary school.

1170
02:04:13,640 --> 02:04:19,670
So security strategy for the high school probably look different and feel different than they do at the elementary school.

1171
02:04:19,670 --> 02:04:27,020
So that was that's another variable that we're matching nine and nine, urban versus rural.

1172
02:04:27,020 --> 02:04:28,999
So urban versus not urban, I should say.

1173
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:35,420
So basically the other factor that we felt was really important and this has been talked about in the literature,

1174
02:04:35,420 --> 02:04:41,480
but the way gun violence looks in urban areas, not in urban areas, certainly plays out very differently.

1175
02:04:42,140 --> 02:04:49,640
Security strategies in like big city schools also tend to look different, lots of different reasons, but we wanted to account for that.

1176
02:04:49,640 --> 02:04:54,080
So if this being a high school is a case school in my sample here,

1177
02:04:54,650 --> 02:05:03,530
there's a control school for this unit is in other New York State School in a non urban area that's also a high school.

1178
02:05:03,530 --> 02:05:09,200
And we basically pulled a list of every public school.

1179
02:05:09,200 --> 02:05:14,900
And this exists this is nice that this exists, a list of every single public school in the United States.

1180
02:05:14,930 --> 02:05:21,350
And we just randomly pick basically we random we randomly pick a control school to match our cases.

1181
02:05:21,770 --> 02:05:26,050
So in our data set, if you're imagining this or in your head right now,

1182
02:05:26,070 --> 02:05:30,979
we have a list of all of our case schools and then then it's twin basically, right?

1183
02:05:30,980 --> 02:05:34,309
It's controlled twin. Okay. And those are our participants.

1184
02:05:34,310 --> 02:05:39,440
So in the lung cancer situation, the participants are individual patients.

1185
02:05:39,800 --> 02:05:42,920
In our case, our participants are actually individual schools.

1186
02:05:44,360 --> 02:05:50,689
The thing I think that's helpful for us in this case is that it's in some ways easier to collect information

1187
02:05:50,690 --> 02:05:56,420
about a school on this issue than it is to collect data from individual kids or teachers about this issue,

1188
02:05:56,870 --> 02:05:59,809
partly given the sensitive nature of the topic,

1189
02:05:59,810 --> 02:06:09,290
but also like to go into a school that has experienced this kind of violence and to do data collection well and in a trauma informed way, challenging.

1190
02:06:09,650 --> 02:06:13,219
And we really wanted to get an understanding of what's happening nationally.

1191
02:06:13,220 --> 02:06:17,270
So we said we want as many schools as we can get in our sample, let's use.

1192
02:06:17,300 --> 02:06:22,760
And so our plan right now is to collect data on every single one of these 658 schools.

1193
02:06:22,760 --> 02:06:26,510
And that's what we've been doing, actually. That's what our that's what that's what I said.

1194
02:06:26,520 --> 02:06:29,720
The third. Yes. So does the intentional school shooting.

1195
02:06:30,260 --> 02:06:37,790
Does that include the actual shooter being a part of that community or someone outside of the community coming to the school?

1196
02:06:38,120 --> 02:06:48,920
That is a great question. So we did not limit our criteria to whether or not the perpetrator was a member of the school community or not.

1197
02:06:48,950 --> 02:06:57,530
We just said it could be a random individual, it could be a student, it could be a former student.

1198
02:06:58,390 --> 02:07:07,910
We did not end up discriminating on that largely because we don't we don't know enough about school shooting perpetrators to really say,

1199
02:07:09,680 --> 02:07:14,299
like, what would place a school at higher risk? Or like, that's such a great question.

1200
02:07:14,300 --> 02:07:20,450
The first thing that we should ask in our next grant, right, to try to understand, like, you know,

1201
02:07:20,450 --> 02:07:24,469
what are we what do we do to better understand the needs of individual perpetrators

1202
02:07:24,470 --> 02:07:29,390
in what what places kids at risk for wanting to perpetrate that kind of violence,

1203
02:07:29,390 --> 02:07:33,170
which I think is such a core critical question that should be considered at this.

1204
02:07:33,410 --> 02:07:38,149
So what you're actually getting out, and I appreciate this so much, is the fact that there's so much we don't know.

1205
02:07:38,150 --> 02:07:43,430
Right. So here we're really saying we're trying to get at schools that are experiencing this kind of violence.

1206
02:07:44,270 --> 02:07:49,219
It's intentional. It uses a gun. It means a gun was shot and aimed at someone.

1207
02:07:49,220 --> 02:07:54,530
Right. There's all these things that we've gone through to try. It has happened at school. It's happened through like specifically during school hour.

1208
02:07:55,010 --> 02:07:58,339
Interestingly, there's lots of I've learned this recently.

1209
02:07:58,340 --> 02:08:04,639
I don't know. I didn't do this. Lots of like gunfire that often happens, like with schools or clothes.

1210
02:08:04,640 --> 02:08:09,890
And people just happened with a gun. A gun might happen to go off in the school parking lot or something like that.

1211
02:08:10,130 --> 02:08:14,150
There's a number of incidents like that that happen that have nothing to do with the school.

1212
02:08:14,150 --> 02:08:20,870
Just the school happens to be there. So we said we're really interested in what's going on when kids and teachers are there.

1213
02:08:20,870 --> 02:08:30,389
Like, what? Going on in that thing. We did include though like school dances and football games and school sanctioned

1214
02:08:30,390 --> 02:08:33,480
events that are happening on the school property because we were like,

1215
02:08:33,480 --> 02:08:36,930
Well, those are all part of the school community day to day.

1216
02:08:36,930 --> 02:08:41,430
Like that's stuff that involves the student, that involves the community of hair, etc.

1217
02:08:41,430 --> 02:08:45,690
So, you know, you have a lot of parents who are carrying firearms to school.

1218
02:08:45,690 --> 02:08:54,659
I mean, I personally would not but like some people do and that's, that's, that's, you know, that's something we have to account for.

1219
02:08:54,660 --> 02:08:59,340
So there's also enough we don't know that we want it to be.

1220
02:08:59,340 --> 02:09:04,620
So this is like this little this is it's funny, I think, because this is this drove us crazy for like months if you're like figuring this out.

1221
02:09:05,040 --> 02:09:12,660
But I feel like really being very intentional about our definition of this was like a big part of figuring out how we arrived at those 657.

1222
02:09:14,880 --> 02:09:18,120
Sorry, no, no, we're not. No one else is going to ask that question cause I answer to one.

1223
02:09:18,120 --> 02:09:21,690
I realize that. Yeah.

1224
02:09:22,200 --> 02:09:29,489
When you marched on level. Yes. Did you account for the fact that some schools don't like there could be a middle

1225
02:09:29,490 --> 02:09:32,940
school that six through eight and there could be a middle school that's only seven.

1226
02:09:32,940 --> 02:09:40,290
They're like seven through nine. Like, did that factor into what was defined as a matching level or was it just how the school terms they felt?

1227
02:09:41,280 --> 02:09:45,990
So what are you doing next week? I'm literally I mean, we are meeting an hour to you.

1228
02:09:46,020 --> 02:09:56,370
This is actually what we're figuring out right now. So our plan is to try and match as closely as possible to the exact what me wants.

1229
02:09:56,370 --> 02:09:57,330
As you're describing,

1230
02:09:57,720 --> 02:10:07,080
most most of the differences we're seeing right now are kind of like a six through eight versus a seven and eight and like a K through five or so.

1231
02:10:07,090 --> 02:10:11,969
The kids, you six or maybe a one through five, like a school that doesn't care.

1232
02:10:11,970 --> 02:10:16,920
So there's small, slight differences and we're going to do our best to try and match as closely as possible.

1233
02:10:17,670 --> 02:10:21,659
But I think there's a general understanding and we have to figure out how we write this.

1234
02:10:21,660 --> 02:10:26,549
I did reach out to a lot of my colleagues in the education world to just be like, How would you do this?

1235
02:10:26,550 --> 02:10:29,820
And he was like, And you study really sad things.

1236
02:10:29,820 --> 02:10:37,860
So that was his main response. But what I said was like, you know, okay, K through five, elementary, six through eight, middle and nine through 12.

1237
02:10:38,190 --> 02:10:42,120
A lot of it is there's like really two reasons I think the school I think this level's important,

1238
02:10:42,120 --> 02:10:46,769
although I'm curious as we think about this one is yeah,

1239
02:10:46,770 --> 02:10:55,830
developmentally like kids like my second grader you know what I thought was really interesting like they did the this like lockdown drill.

1240
02:10:57,630 --> 02:11:05,880
He is thank God he has no idea what it's for. He is just like, yeah, it was really this is what it was literally what he thought he was like.

1241
02:11:05,880 --> 02:11:09,740
It was kind of dumb. They told me to hold that.

1242
02:11:09,930 --> 02:11:17,579
My husband, we don't use words like dumb. And then he said, they told us, Karen, that the teachers are.

1243
02:11:17,580 --> 02:11:22,650
Karen said to hide in my safe space, but his safe space is by the bookcase.

1244
02:11:23,160 --> 02:11:26,250
And he said he got sleepy because they told him to be quiet.

1245
02:11:26,850 --> 02:11:34,420
I actually think he fell asleep, which fine. And then they all got a pack of gummies after hours like this.

1246
02:11:34,440 --> 02:11:41,940
This is what's happened. This is how his school is doing it. It is dumb, like, I mean, it's dumb in the sense that I don't know.

1247
02:11:41,940 --> 02:11:46,200
I'm not really I don't we don't know if that's really affected. I'm not really sure what is teaching them.

1248
02:11:46,980 --> 02:11:50,580
It seems like one more thing the school has to deal with. None of the teachers seem super on board.

1249
02:11:50,580 --> 02:11:54,450
So in this particular context, I'm not really sure what's happening at the high school level.

1250
02:11:54,450 --> 02:12:03,570
And I do some work with a couple of high schools in New York, and the students there who I work with are acutely aware of exactly what it is.

1251
02:12:04,410 --> 02:12:08,040
And they are there's a the way in which a lockdown drill there is taken.

1252
02:12:08,100 --> 02:12:14,879
I think I don't think more seriously, Bush has taken differently the way it's presented, the way it's talked about now,

1253
02:12:14,880 --> 02:12:19,590
lockdown drills as an area actually does have more resources than most of the other strategies

1254
02:12:19,590 --> 02:12:24,780
that we've talked here in the sense of there are some best practices for lockdown drills.

1255
02:12:25,110 --> 02:12:27,239
The National Association for School Psychologist, for example,

1256
02:12:27,240 --> 02:12:31,650
they have a lot of recommendations about how to do those well and a developmentally appropriate way.

1257
02:12:31,860 --> 02:12:36,210
But I think the developmental piece is an important reason why the school level matters.

1258
02:12:36,420 --> 02:12:43,499
The other thing I think is also just like the nature, like the physical layout of like a high school is generally bigger, right?

1259
02:12:43,500 --> 02:12:47,219
More kids, more teachers, the infrastructure is different.

1260
02:12:47,220 --> 02:12:51,180
So like the school security, right, the actual physical building is different.

1261
02:12:51,180 --> 02:12:57,280
One of the things that we're collecting this part of the study is actually like the layout of the school are there stairwell,

1262
02:12:57,300 --> 02:13:00,959
elevator, like those kind of thing? I don't know.

1263
02:13:00,960 --> 02:13:05,520
Like these are all extraneous things. We're going to we're going to make sense of this over the next 18 months or so

1264
02:13:05,520 --> 02:13:09,659
with all of this data to try and get some sense of like patterns and connections.

1265
02:13:09,660 --> 02:13:15,600
But I think what we're trying to do is sort of say, okay, what is conceptually the reason we're matching?

1266
02:13:16,230 --> 02:13:20,130
So I think that was another long answer to your question. Oh, good.

1267
02:13:20,550 --> 02:13:29,100
Thank you. I assume you can't or don't finish your studies early when students in schools.

1268
02:13:29,130 --> 02:13:34,140
I'm wondering I know one big change is going to focus on how people do this.

1269
02:13:34,670 --> 02:13:38,040
And so I'm wondering if there's any way you guys can even do that.

1270
02:13:39,090 --> 02:13:44,340
So tell me. So so students like the students do transfer from school to school.

1271
02:13:44,370 --> 02:13:53,969
But tell me again your question. Okay. So what I'm kind of wondering is like so let's say student A has in their old school,

1272
02:13:53,970 --> 02:14:02,490
they have seen in either the shooting there or somebody brought a gun to school, but then they go to a different school.

1273
02:14:02,910 --> 02:14:10,889
And then this new school hasn't had that. But they still talk about it like this is a very, very old don't shrink thing,

1274
02:14:10,890 --> 02:14:19,110
but would that affect how people perceive and act around that student, how that might play a role?

1275
02:14:20,320 --> 02:14:26,500
So it's a great question. So this actually goes back to that unit of analysis, and I don't think I actually did a good job of explaining this.

1276
02:14:26,520 --> 02:14:31,770
So let me explain this, because I think this might get at what you're asking, which is super important.

1277
02:14:32,760 --> 02:14:37,050
So you're right, there's like a ton of variability, right,

1278
02:14:37,320 --> 02:14:43,770
from school to school or critically class because there are so many kids that are exposed to gun violence outside of schools.

1279
02:14:45,300 --> 02:14:49,560
And as I would say, that that verdict disproportionately fall mostly on black children in this country,

1280
02:14:49,560 --> 02:14:53,129
but also in other children of color in comparison to their white peers.

1281
02:14:53,130 --> 02:14:57,410
But it is an extraordinary number of kids who are exposed to gun violence in different forms.

1282
02:14:58,110 --> 02:15:06,180
And we don't know who exactly who's been exposed, Howard, how they're bringing that to school, how that manifests in the classroom or in other ways.

1283
02:15:06,870 --> 02:15:09,749
We also don't know any of the other really,

1284
02:15:09,750 --> 02:15:18,320
truly infinite number of things that could happen or that a child could experience that would vary one classroom from another.

1285
02:15:18,330 --> 02:15:18,630
Right.

1286
02:15:18,650 --> 02:15:30,299
So it is really difficult to say we wanted to measure instead of 650 schools, we wanted to measure, you know, 606 million at 6.5 million classrooms.

1287
02:15:30,300 --> 02:15:33,990
Right. Like, in theory, our unit of analysis could have been classroom. I'm just making this up.

1288
02:15:34,950 --> 02:15:36,839
It starts to get too messy that right.

1289
02:15:36,840 --> 02:15:43,710
Because even if I look at my little 1/2 grade, there's three secondary classrooms and each class has its own vibe.

1290
02:15:44,160 --> 02:15:47,180
They're both there. It is just different from class to class.

1291
02:15:47,190 --> 02:15:50,729
I don't even know. That's just same school kids.

1292
02:15:50,730 --> 02:15:55,110
We've all been growing up together in the roughly the same neighborhood, kind of all live near each other.

1293
02:15:55,110 --> 02:15:59,250
And it's still there's a lot of difference even in that even at that age, even from classical.

1294
02:15:59,730 --> 02:16:06,090
So the reason we're looking at the school level and I'm going to I'm going to go to this in a moment,

1295
02:16:07,020 --> 02:16:12,030
but we decided with the study is we're not even going to worry about white people in the sense

1296
02:16:12,030 --> 02:16:16,410
that we're not going to worry about measuring anything that's happening at the person level.

1297
02:16:17,190 --> 02:16:24,569
It's too much. It gets too messy, there's too much to control for. I don't know that we would be able to do anything with that information.

1298
02:16:24,570 --> 02:16:28,530
Right? Like, that's the part that's really hard. So what are we going to what could we do instead?

1299
02:16:28,530 --> 02:16:33,120
Well, we can measure. Does every school have a metal detector?

1300
02:16:33,240 --> 02:16:37,530
Does it have or not? Does it have active shooter drills or not?

1301
02:16:37,530 --> 02:16:43,079
Does it our teachers, armed or not? Are there police or not or there life outside or not?

1302
02:16:43,080 --> 02:16:45,870
Are there are signs that say gun free school zones or not?

1303
02:16:46,200 --> 02:16:54,330
There's a lot of things at the physical level and in our grant we identify something like 20 died, 20 died of the most commonly used ones.

1304
02:16:55,230 --> 02:16:58,799
So there's a lot of different strategies, right? 29 strategies or so.

1305
02:16:58,800 --> 02:17:01,320
Is there a nurse or not? Right. This is things like that.

1306
02:17:01,320 --> 02:17:12,270
We basically said are there policies or practices at the school level that we can measure and observe across our 650 schools?

1307
02:17:12,990 --> 02:17:15,780
And then we control for all these other things I was talking about, right?

1308
02:17:15,810 --> 02:17:21,930
Like demographics and physical layout and, you know, all sorts of other kind of things.

1309
02:17:21,930 --> 02:17:26,310
And then try to say, all right, these 329 schools that had a shooting,

1310
02:17:26,970 --> 02:17:31,920
here are the characteristics that defined these schools and here are the experiences and here

1311
02:17:31,920 --> 02:17:35,760
are the characteristics that define these schools that have not did not have a shooting,

1312
02:17:36,120 --> 02:17:40,230
but could have. Right. Where are the differences?

1313
02:17:40,590 --> 02:17:45,600
And are there any associations that are greater or stronger in these schools versus the other?

1314
02:17:47,190 --> 02:17:53,630
I don't know what we're going to find. So I was going to write this thing was like I had this fire that was going to be like

1315
02:17:53,640 --> 02:17:59,910
anticipated findings and I deleted it because I was like like the good scientists we are.

1316
02:17:59,910 --> 02:18:06,360
We actually don't know. Right? We're going into this saying we're truly trying to understand what works and what doesn't.

1317
02:18:06,390 --> 02:18:10,950
Now, I as a mom, do I have strong feelings about certain policies or not?

1318
02:18:10,950 --> 02:18:16,470
Sure, as the unbiased scientists I'm trying to bring to this, like the energy in front to bring to that.

1319
02:18:17,070 --> 02:18:21,300
Yeah, we don't know. We need to measure this in an unbiased way to really figure out what.

1320
02:18:21,410 --> 02:18:25,480
Work through, does it? We actually don't know if that's your point. Absolutely.

1321
02:18:25,490 --> 02:18:32,930
There are so many experiences and things that could change from school to school and that a kid in one school and I'm sure this happens,

1322
02:18:33,680 --> 02:18:35,270
we know this happens that kids,

1323
02:18:35,270 --> 02:18:41,270
especially kids who experience school violence in area like in school where there's a lot of media attention and other things.

1324
02:18:41,750 --> 02:18:46,230
Yeah, it makes sense that family might feel we might leave or move or keep them in at least.

1325
02:18:46,730 --> 02:18:51,830
There's all sorts of things that could happen and they might bring that with them to the new school they go to.

1326
02:18:53,660 --> 02:18:56,690
So again, that could be another study, the right to ask that to say, okay,

1327
02:18:56,720 --> 02:19:05,780
what are the experiences of the kids and the teachers who are going through that and how might that impact their experience in their new school?

1328
02:19:05,780 --> 02:19:13,310
How other kids perceive their school environment? Like if you're a kid who who has never experienced will get a relative, you never thought about it.

1329
02:19:14,120 --> 02:19:18,890
And a kid comes in and they start sharing their experience with their. Maybe that would change your perception of.

1330
02:19:19,130 --> 02:19:23,450
I mean, I don't know. Right. These are things that could be measured and talked. We we're not doing that here.

1331
02:19:23,660 --> 02:19:27,260
Here we're literally say, tell me what's happening at the school level.

1332
02:19:27,590 --> 02:19:33,469
And we're doing it in this occupation. Like, oh, so I'm wondering, so I'm a part of this thing called AmeriCorps.

1333
02:19:33,470 --> 02:19:37,220
It's sort of goes like all of us. Yeah, yeah.

1334
02:19:37,910 --> 02:19:46,680
It's often a lot of our training with our schools. Like we are not veterans, but we are definitely somebody that kids might trust.

1335
02:19:46,820 --> 02:19:54,170
Yeah. So there's an understanding of that. And I'm wondering, do you have like so yeah, you have like, like safety features.

1336
02:19:54,170 --> 02:19:57,710
Like do you have to like sign onto the office? Do you have security?

1337
02:19:58,280 --> 02:20:07,940
But do you include things like afterschool programs where I have have that engagement with other parts of their age group or for other adults?

1338
02:20:08,660 --> 02:20:15,810
Because I'm wondering about like so in our first version of the grant that did not get funded, we did include that.

1339
02:20:17,090 --> 02:20:23,840
And then the reviewers had an okay and this is a little play and this was, this was this was I thought the reviewer brought up a good point.

1340
02:20:24,290 --> 02:20:30,049
I can see now now that they gave have a feed and this is what they this is what the reviewer said.

1341
02:20:30,050 --> 02:20:35,020
And I think this is their I'm not bitter. It took me like three years to find you guys.

1342
02:20:35,100 --> 02:20:39,530
This is fine. I will say that we did get this funding. I told I said to the dark.

1343
02:20:39,550 --> 02:20:41,990
Right. I was like, I will be happy about this.

1344
02:20:42,350 --> 02:20:46,549
Not that we have to do this study, but I will be grateful for this funding for the rest of my life just because I was like,

1345
02:20:46,550 --> 02:20:48,860
so glad we got it to answer some of this.

1346
02:20:48,860 --> 02:20:56,450
But what the reviewer said and that's such a great question, was, okay, let's say you're poor, let's say and you can find this out.

1347
02:20:56,450 --> 02:21:03,250
It's all there. The school that what if this your school does offer a bullying prevention program crawl on

1348
02:21:03,260 --> 02:21:07,850
the road or any number of like the thousands of after school programs that exist that,

1349
02:21:08,240 --> 02:21:11,870
you know, do address social emotional learning skills or whatever it might be.

1350
02:21:11,870 --> 02:21:20,359
Okay. But there's tons of research that also shows that, like implementation of these programs varies considerably, right?

1351
02:21:20,360 --> 02:21:23,810
From school to school, from class to class for a student student.

1352
02:21:24,380 --> 02:21:29,630
And then we realized that that sort of took away that again became muddled.

1353
02:21:29,630 --> 02:21:34,430
Right. So what the reviews are saying is you have all these other you have these like school features, right?

1354
02:21:34,430 --> 02:21:41,360
Like are there barriers or are there like you're really looking at school safety tactics and policies at the school level.

1355
02:21:41,360 --> 02:21:48,169
Right. And the these programs are really getting down more to that granular level.

1356
02:21:48,170 --> 02:21:54,799
So if we really kind of just sit with this like school as a unit of analysis, at the end of the day, we were like,

1357
02:21:54,800 --> 02:22:06,110
What are the things that really are schoolwide, that are in place because of gun violence as a potential threat, like the anticipation of that?

1358
02:22:06,620 --> 02:22:09,980
And that could be measured consistently from school to school.

1359
02:22:10,280 --> 02:22:15,440
So this is the other thing, right? Like so I do a lot of afterschool programs, application work with myself.

1360
02:22:15,980 --> 02:22:21,090
I can tell you like just because the program says it's happening like on the website

1361
02:22:21,110 --> 02:22:24,439
doesn't mean it actually took place or that everyone came or that it's being implemented.

1362
02:22:24,440 --> 02:22:30,080
Right? All of a good thing. Whereas a metal detector, it's just there and you walk through it every day or you don't.

1363
02:22:30,410 --> 02:22:34,100
If it's not there, it's not there. So there are some things that are just cleaner to measure.

1364
02:22:34,520 --> 02:22:38,899
Now, that doesn't mean that measuring, by the way, these programs aren't important.

1365
02:22:38,900 --> 02:22:44,990
They're extremely important. And we should be doing that to the challenge in doing this kind of research always.

1366
02:22:44,990 --> 02:22:50,750
And this is every now and then I'm like, Well, if I was back in the lab with those damn cell, it would be a lot easier to control for this, right?

1367
02:22:50,750 --> 02:22:53,450
When you're sitting there like, say, how do I like fix it?

1368
02:22:53,750 --> 02:22:59,479
How do I have that controlled environment when you're working with people in schools and systems that are so like their living,

1369
02:22:59,480 --> 02:23:07,520
breathing ecosystems, right? We have to do the best we can to try and say, all right, here is the cleanest way we can measure this phenomenon.

1370
02:23:07,970 --> 02:23:10,250
So what we're doing here is trying to capture that.

1371
02:23:10,250 --> 02:23:14,750
And the way we're doing it, actually, it's kind of interesting is we're looking at school safety plans,

1372
02:23:15,170 --> 02:23:21,110
which are a legally binding document the schools have to put together. Publics will have to put together where they go to.

1373
02:23:21,170 --> 02:23:26,420
The state of we are. They're there, they live, they live.

1374
02:23:26,420 --> 02:23:31,490
They document all of the different strategies that a school has in place for a given school year.

1375
02:23:32,690 --> 02:23:40,400
And we're doing that coupled with some other forms of data collection that you can find online, lots of basically information that you can't.

1376
02:23:41,060 --> 02:23:46,760
It's hard to dispute or it's not asking someone to remember like, was this policy in place?

1377
02:23:46,760 --> 02:23:52,819
It's just either either what they're or not. So we tried to do this is how we eventually got this funding, right, is we were like, okay,

1378
02:23:52,820 --> 02:23:57,340
we're going to do this in a way that's as clean as possible because and understandably so,

1379
02:23:57,350 --> 02:24:03,589
650 schools with a lot of schools like my seven year old being called at the time, actually, we were doing all this other stuff.

1380
02:24:03,590 --> 02:24:07,190
We would never finish the study. So the idea was also to say, what do we need now?

1381
02:24:07,190 --> 02:24:11,780
We need some information and why do we need it? Well, this is it, right?

1382
02:24:11,780 --> 02:24:18,710
So this is sort of the crux of why we're doing this is to say, well, we have all these schools all just trying to do their best,

1383
02:24:19,010 --> 02:24:26,390
living through a global pandemic that I mean, you don't have to go into everything that schools are facing now that teachers are facing now.

1384
02:24:26,900 --> 02:24:32,300
But it is an extraordinarily challenging time to be a school leader, to be a teacher.

1385
02:24:33,050 --> 02:24:40,490
What schools right now? I think his support to do their job well and to have some guidance.

1386
02:24:40,490 --> 02:24:48,590
Right. For, yes. Gun violence until we address the other factors that contribute to school gun violence in a meaningful way.

1387
02:24:49,220 --> 02:24:55,160
School. Yeah, they're not school. Gun violence is it is a small part of the gun violence problem in this country.

1388
02:24:55,160 --> 02:24:58,280
But it is a problem. It's a problem that should be addressed.

1389
02:24:58,310 --> 02:25:03,020
It's certainly one in which the anticipation of it in and of itself is problematic.

1390
02:25:03,440 --> 02:25:08,150
It's something that's causing teachers and school leaders to say, we should be doing something about it, of course.

1391
02:25:08,690 --> 02:25:17,960
So instead of leaving it to putting the burden on them to say, figure it out, let's give some guidance that where there's actual evidence saying,

1392
02:25:18,320 --> 02:25:25,100
all right, if you have a limited budget, which every public school does well, don't waste it on something that, you know, doesn't work.

1393
02:25:25,520 --> 02:25:30,169
And maybe we'll find in the study that, well, some things were here and some things don't work here.

1394
02:25:30,170 --> 02:25:34,819
And maybe we're not I'm not sure exactly what we're going to find in this, but we'll find something.

1395
02:25:34,820 --> 02:25:40,700
The idea is we'll have some information from hopefully from this work that we didn't have before that could be informative.

1396
02:25:40,700 --> 02:25:43,700
Right. I thought I tried on your name was okay.

1397
02:25:44,300 --> 02:25:51,709
And so I'm trying to conceptualize worry that actually look, we're doing a case control study retrospectively.

1398
02:25:51,710 --> 02:25:54,740
Yes, but we're only focusing on schools. Yep.

1399
02:25:54,750 --> 02:25:58,670
So are we looking at their safety plans?

1400
02:25:58,670 --> 02:26:02,840
They had structure of the school staff, security things.

1401
02:26:03,230 --> 02:26:08,299
And are we trying to look for trends to say that this school had metal detectors?

1402
02:26:08,300 --> 02:26:12,130
So this is why it was able to prevent school shooting for an individual.

1403
02:26:12,230 --> 02:26:16,960
And I'm like that. No, that is such a good question. That's that is that is the question.

1404
02:26:16,970 --> 02:26:21,560
I didn't do a good job of explaining it. So let me try to and you can tell me if I answer your question.

1405
02:26:22,100 --> 02:26:27,920
So essentially what we're doing is we're saying so in my imagine you have imagine the Excel sheet, okay?

1406
02:26:28,100 --> 02:26:32,089
And it has this high school in there is a furnace unit, high school.

1407
02:26:32,090 --> 02:26:34,879
We're going to go through the safety plan. We're using Google Street View.

1408
02:26:34,880 --> 02:26:39,010
We're going to look at data from the National Center for Education Statistics.

1409
02:26:39,020 --> 02:26:47,599
We have about let's see. But right now, we like 12 different sources of data that we're using to basically tell a story about this one school,

1410
02:26:47,600 --> 02:26:51,079
which has all of this information safety, all these safety strategies.

1411
02:26:51,080 --> 02:26:54,200
Are they in place or not? How many kids do they serve?

1412
02:26:54,200 --> 02:26:57,740
How many teachers like is it a title one school or not? All of these.

1413
02:26:57,890 --> 02:27:02,600
We have all these variables we've identified about the school and we're going to do this for every single school.

1414
02:27:02,600 --> 02:27:07,130
So we started doing math. It's really interesting. It takes a long time, but we're doing this for every single school.

1415
02:27:07,250 --> 02:27:16,250
Okay, then what we're going to do is essentially find out what are the odds in what a case control study allows you to do is to say,

1416
02:27:16,250 --> 02:27:23,030
all right, if you were a school. And what we've done is those 29 safety strategies I was talking about.

1417
02:27:23,630 --> 02:27:26,090
So we have grouped into different categories.

1418
02:27:26,090 --> 02:27:34,280
So I think we have different name for them, but we have like maybe five things that would be considered external hardening strategies.

1419
02:27:34,910 --> 02:27:41,260
And another five things that are internal hardening strategies are the three things that are reporting for other.

1420
02:27:41,300 --> 02:27:45,290
We have different name for them, right? So what we're trying to say is, all right,

1421
02:27:45,290 --> 02:27:55,540
if you are a school and you have and you if you if you're a school and you have this combination of these strategies, okay?

1422
02:27:56,630 --> 02:28:00,410
And we're controlling for all the stuff that's happening outside of it to the best that we can.

1423
02:28:01,370 --> 02:28:07,130
Are you at greater risk or for experiencing a school shooting or not?

1424
02:28:07,820 --> 02:28:13,250
Do any of these strategies place you at greater risk, or do they or conversely, do they place you at lower risk?

1425
02:28:13,670 --> 02:28:20,960
And the reason we're able to do that is because we have this control group of schools that have never experienced a shooting but are other.

1426
02:28:21,930 --> 02:28:26,010
Just like the school that did. So we can actually draw some comparisons.

1427
02:28:26,220 --> 02:28:29,970
So we're trying to estimate. Here is such a great question. Is risk.

1428
02:28:30,540 --> 02:28:34,950
That's really what a case control study is allowing you to do, is to estimate risk.

1429
02:28:35,880 --> 02:28:44,820
It's probably not perfect. And what we are you likely imagine we will end up doing or end up seeing is that it is some combination.

1430
02:28:44,820 --> 02:28:50,460
Like we might see patterns. We might see patterns within like urban schools that look different.

1431
02:28:50,790 --> 02:28:56,190
Right, than non-urban schools. Like I think we might see differences in that way, but I'm not sure yet.

1432
02:28:56,460 --> 02:28:59,810
But that's what we're trying to measure to that. Get them. Let's get.

1433
02:28:59,940 --> 02:29:03,150
Okay, question here. The question there. Yeah.

1434
02:29:03,810 --> 02:29:12,040
Behavioral Intervention School. Yeah. So we are measuring.

1435
02:29:12,060 --> 02:29:21,810
I'll tell you what we're measuring. We're measuring whether or not a school has a nurse or another like medical professional on staff or on site.

1436
02:29:21,810 --> 02:29:31,380
I think it's how we worded it. We're also measuring and whether or not schools have a full time mental health professionals on staff or not.

1437
02:29:31,680 --> 02:29:41,370
But I think that was the extent of the personnel in terms of like going to far beyond the schools are not legally required,

1438
02:29:41,370 --> 02:29:46,310
for example, to have a school nurse physically on staff and present every single day.

1439
02:29:46,530 --> 02:29:53,040
Like there are some it's sort of interesting. And even school psychologists like it doesn't have to be a school psychologist by any means.

1440
02:29:53,040 --> 02:29:58,259
Right. So there's a lot of you see a lot of variability within a school.

1441
02:29:58,260 --> 02:30:00,090
So we're just interested in that.

1442
02:30:01,290 --> 02:30:09,869
Yeah, you, sir, I know you've been patiently waiting, but I was wondering if your study measures psychological safety,

1443
02:30:09,870 --> 02:30:14,040
especially for kids with these different issues that schools are doing,

1444
02:30:14,220 --> 02:30:22,380
is obviously the exposure to something as heavy as is younger children are very controlled, is a lot of burden.

1445
02:30:22,890 --> 02:30:29,150
So whether or not there's an analysis on that in terms of outcomes for which is so great question.

1446
02:30:29,160 --> 02:30:30,299
We're not doing that in the study.

1447
02:30:30,300 --> 02:30:39,120
I am doing that with Charlie and another study that we're running at the same time and we're in the knee deep in that too.

1448
02:30:39,840 --> 02:30:44,370
And so maybe if I come back in a year, we'll have findings and I guess I can share that with you,

1449
02:30:44,370 --> 02:30:51,719
that in that study, what we're doing, it's interesting, that study is almost like a sister to this one in the sense of if in that study we're taking

1450
02:30:51,720 --> 02:30:57,510
six cases and six controls and we're measuring we're collecting data directly from the kids.

1451
02:30:58,140 --> 02:31:08,640
But I'm going to tell you that that data collection process is really it's like in some ways easier because it is like,

1452
02:31:08,640 --> 02:31:12,810
okay, we're just going in and get doing a survey. And it's sort of in some ways a little easier.

1453
02:31:12,810 --> 02:31:17,010
2012 schools, not 650, but building to do that,

1454
02:31:17,010 --> 02:31:25,020
we've basically been working with surviving teachers who are helping us build connections and relationships with these schools.

1455
02:31:25,920 --> 02:31:32,010
And that's hard, I think. I think Charlie and I would both say those meetings are hard.

1456
02:31:32,430 --> 02:31:40,680
I think they're hard. And going to those schools, I think that's a that's a different kind of it's data collection we're doing, but it's challenging.

1457
02:31:40,680 --> 02:31:46,980
And what we're trying to document in that study is more along the lines of what what are the mental health burdens that kids are carrying,

1458
02:31:47,190 --> 02:31:50,399
not just the kids who have been exposed to a school shooting in their school,

1459
02:31:50,400 --> 02:31:55,590
but also among kids who have never experienced school shooting, but like you say,

1460
02:31:56,070 --> 02:32:01,890
are living in a world in which the anticipation of that kind of gun violence is so poor, is so prevalent in there.

1461
02:32:04,080 --> 02:32:08,040
And so we're trying to get a better sense of essentially what is what's happening.

1462
02:32:08,040 --> 02:32:18,810
And we're collecting data actually in that city from teachers as well. So it ain't great, you guys, what's happening in our school.

1463
02:32:19,320 --> 02:32:25,140
But I think what our hope is, is by documenting and measuring this in some sort of mythic mythological way,

1464
02:32:25,440 --> 02:32:32,010
we can actually help take like existing resources and redirect them in a more useful way.

1465
02:32:32,730 --> 02:32:36,490
It might be maybe my little one mocking these lockdown rules.

1466
02:32:36,520 --> 02:32:40,259
Maybe they're maybe they are helpful and maybe that's what we'll find.

1467
02:32:40,260 --> 02:32:45,749
And I will eat my hat if that is true. And okay, fine. But we don't really know yet.

1468
02:32:45,750 --> 02:32:52,590
Like there's just so much we don't know and yet so much money, time and energy that's being spent doing something we don't know works.

1469
02:32:52,590 --> 02:32:56,190
And honestly, isn't there anything obviously to solve the issue of gun violence?

1470
02:32:56,190 --> 02:33:02,519
Because that issue just continues to to persist. So it's a little it's and I could be here for the rest of your life you guys to about

1471
02:33:02,520 --> 02:33:07,169
this I want I to really everybody got someone else had their hand I feel like.

1472
02:33:07,170 --> 02:33:10,680
Yes, sorry. Go ahead. I'm just confused.

1473
02:33:11,070 --> 02:33:15,510
Yeah, that's okay. That's okay. That's your mother.

1474
02:33:15,510 --> 02:33:18,990
Stuff like the nurse to have a social emotional connection.

1475
02:33:19,740 --> 02:33:25,890
But you're saying the. But all of this, regardless of the shooter, if he's part of the sport or not.

1476
02:33:26,880 --> 02:33:35,940
So how well, like what was a nurse or a mental that oh, you know, have an effect of the shooter was not even from the school.

1477
02:33:36,420 --> 02:33:40,620
So in this city, we're not measuring social emotional learning or anything like that.

1478
02:33:40,980 --> 02:33:50,430
The reason we included the nurse, and that's a great question was and the reason we included the, uh, the school,

1479
02:33:50,520 --> 02:33:56,309
the mental health professionals is because many, many school perpetrators often are part of the school community in some way.

1480
02:33:56,310 --> 02:34:00,840
So I think that was just we felt like that was a piece of information that would be good to know.

1481
02:34:01,650 --> 02:34:08,730
The nurses we we wanted to know with honestly, because one of the things we're looking at is just number of injuries,

1482
02:34:09,600 --> 02:34:15,440
number of injuries and deaths in any of these instances and maybe the administration of like

1483
02:34:15,450 --> 02:34:20,390
first aid or are there things that is that is that helpful to have some sort of first aid?

1484
02:34:20,430 --> 02:34:21,329
I mean, I don't know. Right.

1485
02:34:21,330 --> 02:34:28,710
So you aren't comparing schools have the shootings to other schools that had the shootings and how they acted on the shootings?

1486
02:34:29,340 --> 02:34:38,190
Right. Yes. So not just what makes one school address, but how one squad reacts to the shooting.

1487
02:34:39,420 --> 02:34:43,110
Yeah. Yes. The also. Yes. Okay.

1488
02:34:43,140 --> 02:34:46,469
So, no, these are such great questions. It's a very helpful for me to think through this with you.

1489
02:34:46,470 --> 02:34:54,150
So the strategies that we're all looking at so we're going to talk about later today.

1490
02:34:54,150 --> 02:35:03,090
But the prevention of school gun violence is like really it should include should include efforts that start way,

1491
02:35:03,090 --> 02:35:06,899
way, way, way, way before a shooting is taking place in the school.

1492
02:35:06,900 --> 02:35:15,180
Right. So like a metal detector or a, you know, first aid by hand or kid or like, you know, all or an arm teacher.

1493
02:35:15,180 --> 02:35:20,430
Those that's not gun violence prevention, right? That's like gun violence reaction.

1494
02:35:20,970 --> 02:35:26,879
And that's mostly what we talk we talk about prevention or we hear being talked about, which is like, okay,

1495
02:35:26,880 --> 02:35:32,220
we're going to we're figuring out how do we react to these violent acts in a moment of that's

1496
02:35:32,220 --> 02:35:36,510
mostly how gun violence prevention gets talked about in the context of school policies.

1497
02:35:38,220 --> 02:35:43,680
What you're getting at and I this is I agree with it fully, which is that prevention is really like, well,

1498
02:35:43,680 --> 02:35:51,419
what happened in like the ten leading up to a 16 year old shooting to bring a firearm to a school and harm himself or others or themselves or others,

1499
02:35:51,420 --> 02:35:58,860
because prevention like we would do for any other public health issue is like a lifetime's worth of things that should be happening.

1500
02:35:58,860 --> 02:36:01,079
So this is the hill that I will die on.

1501
02:36:01,080 --> 02:36:07,620
But this is that to me is what gun violence prevention is housing and greenspace and schools that are actually nurturing and safe and inclusive.

1502
02:36:08,010 --> 02:36:11,309
All of that, though, that's gun violence prevention.

1503
02:36:11,310 --> 02:36:18,969
Right. What we are talking about in the study is really what you use here is is what are all the reactionary policies

1504
02:36:18,970 --> 02:36:26,370
that we have in place that are intended to either help schools respond in the moment of or immediately before?

1505
02:36:26,400 --> 02:36:28,979
Right. And that's what we're trying to understand.

1506
02:36:28,980 --> 02:36:34,500
And this is where the study kind of emerged from this like me reading the news and like ranting about it,

1507
02:36:34,500 --> 02:36:37,979
like being like, what is this garbage that's happening in our school right now?

1508
02:36:37,980 --> 02:36:42,690
This is ridiculous. And we don't even know if it works. Well, let's figure out if it works.

1509
02:36:43,320 --> 02:36:46,469
That's what we're doing. That's what we wrote in the graph. Exactly. Word for word.

1510
02:36:46,470 --> 02:36:53,750
And they were like, okay, we're sitting with families comparing lockdown jokes because I know that the Michael schools.

1511
02:36:53,760 --> 02:36:58,770
Yeah, a lot of them, they do run away but they don't.

1512
02:36:59,460 --> 02:37:03,210
Yeah. So we are we have differentiated between. Great question.

1513
02:37:03,630 --> 02:37:06,140
God, I want all of you to come to our study meetings.

1514
02:37:06,160 --> 02:37:13,110
The third hopeful and the we have differentiated between lockdown drills and active shooter drills.

1515
02:37:13,110 --> 02:37:16,320
So we are they are I think active shooter tools are what you're describing.

1516
02:37:16,860 --> 02:37:20,220
Lockdown rules are what my little one does, which is nothing over the lockdown.

1517
02:37:21,570 --> 02:37:30,209
So it's thrown away, obviously. I think, though, there's a woods next to them, so they're out into the woods and that leads to a church.

1518
02:37:30,210 --> 02:37:34,720
So that's when they kind of run away, like out of class.

1519
02:37:34,740 --> 02:37:38,370
Yeah, they. I don't know. Oh, I've been into the woods.

1520
02:37:39,570 --> 02:37:45,670
So this is where I'll say, like, there are no woods imminent.

1521
02:37:45,690 --> 02:37:51,000
And so, like I like I'm not sure where they go. Like if they let the kids out there just be like on the street, you know?

1522
02:37:51,510 --> 02:37:58,469
So this is where I'm not trying to make light of it, but like when we try and tease out like the differences of like how a school set up and maybe how

1523
02:37:58,470 --> 02:38:03,209
they run these different kinds of drugs these are part of but we're not getting super granular.

1524
02:38:03,210 --> 02:38:08,670
So I think you're getting at something here. This is a limitation of the study, which is that we're not getting super we're we're back.

1525
02:38:08,820 --> 02:38:13,500
We're managing. There was a time before we knew definitively that smoking cause lung cancer, right?

1526
02:38:13,500 --> 02:38:16,590
That's where we are with some of this. We just don't know.

1527
02:38:16,950 --> 02:38:20,610
And we're trying to establish some pretty basic associations. But to do it in.

1528
02:38:20,690 --> 02:38:24,270
A rigorous way. So that's what this is trying to get.

1529
02:38:24,290 --> 02:38:32,300
Go ahead. What is one question you're trying to answer? Which of these schools should school strategies are effective?

1530
02:38:32,510 --> 02:38:35,600
Deterring intentional event violence? Which, if any.

1531
02:38:36,050 --> 02:38:38,150
Which event? Yeah. Yeah.

1532
02:38:38,390 --> 02:38:48,120
So that is the hope for for looking at risk to then make recommendations for adoption across the nation, which would then impact we should see it.

1533
02:38:48,140 --> 02:38:52,320
And there are the number of intentional. Spiritually.

1534
02:38:53,410 --> 02:38:57,040
Okay. That is really good. God, this is good. Good.

1535
02:38:57,230 --> 02:39:01,210
Okay. The first part of what you just said. Yeah, the goal is.

1536
02:39:01,480 --> 02:39:11,200
So one of our colleagues who is working with us is a former superintendent of Newtown public schools where the Sandy Hook shooting took place.

1537
02:39:12,250 --> 02:39:15,040
And worked very closely with the American Association of Superintendents.

1538
02:39:15,040 --> 02:39:19,720
And so people who are thinking about like the practicality of this on a daily basis.

1539
02:39:20,290 --> 02:39:23,470
So one of our hopes with this work is to say,

1540
02:39:24,700 --> 02:39:30,700
you give me all your safety plans and let's review them to at least include or at

1541
02:39:30,700 --> 02:39:34,890
least not include the things that we are able to show are definitively not helpful.

1542
02:39:34,900 --> 02:39:38,890
So maybe that could be like one specific thing that could come out of that.

1543
02:39:40,300 --> 02:39:48,490
And maybe then and this is the next study which we're I hope you're excited for, the next variety is what should we be doing instead?

1544
02:39:48,520 --> 02:39:52,570
So that's like, right, like, okay, we shouldn't have armed teachers or we shouldn't do the.

1545
02:39:52,900 --> 02:40:00,640
So what do we do instead? Now, I philosophically don't believe that the burden of the solution should be placed on school to figure out,

1546
02:40:00,700 --> 02:40:06,830
because that is not the responsibility of the school. And like I said, I will preach about that until the end of my days.

1547
02:40:06,850 --> 02:40:13,600
But the the what we want what we do want instead is to at least be able to help schools say, all right.

1548
02:40:14,290 --> 02:40:18,360
Here is a set of things don't work like this.

1549
02:40:18,610 --> 02:40:26,590
This isn't helpful. But maybe these are more helpful right now as to whether or not that will solve the issue of intentional gun violence.

1550
02:40:27,120 --> 02:40:31,689
The challenge here is that the prevention of school gun violence at the end of the

1551
02:40:31,690 --> 02:40:37,840
day cannot be the result of just like changes in school policy by themselves.

1552
02:40:38,680 --> 02:40:44,410
It also means that, like, if we need to make it harder for kids to have access to firearms,

1553
02:40:44,770 --> 02:40:50,290
we need to teach families who do own firearms how to store those guns safely and securely.

1554
02:40:50,680 --> 02:40:58,899
We need to be working on, you know, doing like, for example, behavioral threat assessment or working with programs like Sandy Hook Promise,

1555
02:40:58,900 --> 02:41:02,350
where you're where you really are actually trying to identify, okay,

1556
02:41:02,410 --> 02:41:06,460
who are the kids who seem to be at higher risk and what are we doing to intervene again?

1557
02:41:06,470 --> 02:41:12,220
Well, before there's an immediate threat of violence, what are we doing in the communities?

1558
02:41:12,220 --> 02:41:18,700
Like if kids are going to and from school and they are hearing gunshots and they are exposed to this kind of violence on a regular basis,

1559
02:41:19,420 --> 02:41:23,800
they're coming to school then with these histories of trauma. So what are we doing about that?

1560
02:41:24,070 --> 02:41:28,209
And then recognizing that gun violence is not even the only thing that these kids have been dealing with.

1561
02:41:28,210 --> 02:41:31,690
Right. Like a quarter million kids have lost parents to COVID.

1562
02:41:31,800 --> 02:41:35,790
Like, there are so much that kids are coming to school with all sorts of stuff.

1563
02:41:35,800 --> 02:41:38,860
So what are we doing? And when I say we, I mean collectively.

1564
02:41:38,860 --> 02:41:45,760
But how are we advocating? Knowing what we know about what's best for kids and their kids and their learning and their growth and everything?

1565
02:41:46,090 --> 02:41:50,950
What are we doing to ensure that our resources, resources, resources are going where they should?

1566
02:41:51,370 --> 02:41:59,379
Which is to say probably all the like the expense of arming or school personnel may not be the best use of those funds.

1567
02:41:59,380 --> 02:42:04,900
Right. Maybe there's other things to do with it. Yeah. So that's where the idea with knowledge is.

1568
02:42:05,860 --> 02:42:09,130
That's where you go. Like, I'm going to be like, all right, what do you know?

1569
02:42:09,140 --> 02:42:14,200
We know this literally. I think I like to call it crowdsourcing.

1570
02:42:14,320 --> 02:42:23,200
Yeah, that's that's yeah, that's exactly where like, I don't, for example, have like our colleague, Dr. Julie Sheeler, she's a criminologist.

1571
02:42:23,200 --> 02:42:31,659
She really she has an understanding of not only like the legal leaves, but also like how policies get implemented,

1572
02:42:31,660 --> 02:42:37,410
what that looks like on the ground, how they get taken up this stuff like that, which is so informative.

1573
02:42:37,420 --> 02:42:41,170
One of our other colleagues, she's a pediatrician, right? So she's working.

1574
02:42:41,590 --> 02:42:45,160
She sees a lot of kids in the aftermath of that.

1575
02:42:45,910 --> 02:42:52,420
And then we have folks everywhere in between. And so I think that is essentially how we it also helps to work with your friends,

1576
02:42:52,420 --> 02:42:57,729
which is my basic my life advice for all students is to collaborate your work with

1577
02:42:57,730 --> 02:43:01,030
your friends so you can have these conversations that are difficult and hard and say,

1578
02:43:01,030 --> 02:43:05,259
no, that's not right or no. You're you know, you're not thinking about that.

1579
02:43:05,260 --> 02:43:08,820
Right. It's good to about this idea that someone else had a hand. All right.

1580
02:43:10,180 --> 02:43:16,900
Do you feel your collective will sort of reach or be able to be effective in the conversation, the country?

1581
02:43:18,430 --> 02:43:32,020
I hope so. I do also, I you know, I think a lot I had a few months ago, I had to give a like a present.

1582
02:43:32,020 --> 02:43:38,229
So, you know, in faculty, we spent a lot of time trying to get money for all of this work, a lot of a lot of the work we do.

1583
02:43:38,230 --> 02:43:45,160
And I had to give this presentation to the Board of Trustees member at Columbia who

1584
02:43:45,400 --> 02:43:50,170
was interested in giving some money to to fund some initiative or doing their own.

1585
02:43:51,410 --> 02:43:57,530
So it him and a few other people. And so I go and I give my spiel and I'm, you know, whatever.

1586
02:43:57,530 --> 02:44:00,620
And then he says he's like, okay, okay.

1587
02:44:00,620 --> 02:44:06,060
And then he says, All right. So at the end, he was like, so like, what do you hope, like ten years from now?

1588
02:44:06,080 --> 02:44:10,280
Like, what's the goal with this? Right? Like ten years from now, 15 years from now? Like, where do you see this work?

1589
02:44:10,940 --> 02:44:16,010
I didn't mean to say it so bluntly, but I did. And my students were with me and they were like, okay.

1590
02:44:17,780 --> 02:44:21,000
And I was like, Well, I hope 15 years from now, ten years, I'm not doing this work.

1591
02:44:21,020 --> 02:44:25,100
Like, I'm like, this is this is what I was like.

1592
02:44:25,910 --> 02:44:29,600
This is a solvable problem. This is not rocket science.

1593
02:44:29,630 --> 02:44:31,610
This is a problem that can be fixed.

1594
02:44:32,690 --> 02:44:41,390
And I think this is just my maybe my personal belief, but I think a lot of the inability to fix it has a lot to do with how it gets talked about.

1595
02:44:42,170 --> 02:44:50,120
And so a lot of my my own writing and my thinking and even with like media lately has been focused on, yes, this is what we know.

1596
02:44:50,120 --> 02:44:55,069
And yes, we need research and funding to do more because you can always do better and that should always be the goal.

1597
02:44:55,070 --> 02:44:58,910
But like we can do so much better than where we are right now.

1598
02:44:58,910 --> 02:45:06,500
And I think a lot of it has to do with how it gets talked about in the context of, you know, Second Amendment rights.

1599
02:45:06,500 --> 02:45:11,030
And listen, I have my in-laws who I love.

1600
02:45:11,030 --> 02:45:14,059
Do you really live on a farm? They own firearms.

1601
02:45:14,060 --> 02:45:20,710
They are the most wonderful people on the face of this planet. There's nothing we can live safely, coexist safely with firearms.

1602
02:45:20,720 --> 02:45:25,940
In fact, I would argue that most of us doing this work aren't anti firearm or anti firearm violence,

1603
02:45:26,330 --> 02:45:30,230
and I don't think there's a single person that's not true.

1604
02:45:30,680 --> 02:45:35,180
I would say most people are not going to disagree with that.

1605
02:45:35,180 --> 02:45:41,200
Right. I think the average person would love for their kid to go to school and enjoy school and not have to be doing these drills.

1606
02:45:41,210 --> 02:45:44,390
I think most people would agree with some of the basic core tenets.

1607
02:45:44,780 --> 02:45:47,780
I think most people would agree that there is an urgency to fix this,

1608
02:45:47,780 --> 02:45:53,450
which is why I actually think we often see a lot of bad proposal being put forward by policymakers.

1609
02:45:53,810 --> 02:46:01,460
You know, I had a reporter call me over the summer and she said about some something that was being put forth by the Ohio governor.

1610
02:46:02,480 --> 02:46:04,520
And she's like, well, can you believe you're proposing this?

1611
02:46:04,520 --> 02:46:11,809
And I was like, I can, because he probably has kids and he's probably pissed that this is happening and that we should be doing something about it.

1612
02:46:11,810 --> 02:46:18,930
And this is the solution here proposing. In fairness to him, there's no one else out there vocally saying something otherwise.

1613
02:46:18,950 --> 02:46:25,279
And that's why he's saying this. She was really shocked and she did not run that quote, which is fine, but I was like this.

1614
02:46:25,280 --> 02:46:30,230
But that's why he and I disagree on how to do it. But we agree there's an urgency to fix something.

1615
02:46:30,680 --> 02:46:34,040
And I just think there's a way in which we could talk about this. It is different.

1616
02:46:34,040 --> 02:46:40,129
So yeah, I hope like I don't want to put words in her life, but I do think that when he and I talk about this work,

1617
02:46:40,130 --> 02:46:47,990
it's like this feels important because this feels like something that could be addressed here and now and

1618
02:46:47,990 --> 02:46:53,690
in a way that was like thoughtful and really getting at something that is impacting so many schools.

1619
02:46:53,690 --> 02:46:55,490
Right? Like it feels like something that could be done.

1620
02:46:55,880 --> 02:47:01,670
I don't think we're going to fix anything with one fix everything with one study, but I think it'll give us something to move forward with it.

1621
02:47:01,680 --> 02:47:06,580
Having fun? I don't know. What else?

1622
02:47:08,290 --> 02:47:13,690
I can't believe I had that so embarrassed. I've been coughing and sneezing. I really do feel like so much better than I did last week.

1623
02:47:14,290 --> 02:47:18,400
And I did get a PCR test like two days ago to make sure it really is not COVID.

1624
02:47:19,330 --> 02:47:26,740
That said, seven year old likes to climb into our bed every night. So that's that's what this is about.

1625
02:47:27,820 --> 02:47:34,450
This is I will the references. But maybe you can remind Twitter where I usually carry a lot of opinions.

1626
02:47:34,980 --> 02:47:38,610
You can e-mail me anytime they were having me here.

1627
02:47:38,620 --> 02:47:43,280
We hang out for lunch.

1628
02:47:45,280 --> 02:47:52,929
So, folks, we are kind of air time. But I am I want you to think and I'll I'll even throw out a couple of softballs here,

1629
02:47:52,930 --> 02:47:59,290
the announcement board in terms of what we thought, what we heard today, we heard same kind of from gun violence.

1630
02:47:59,410 --> 02:48:05,440
It was the focus of two years, two lectures we had, one that was focused on community level policing,

1631
02:48:05,440 --> 02:48:07,659
one that is focused on school level, different approaches.

1632
02:48:07,660 --> 02:48:13,990
One was more ethnography interviews, one was more in a case control trial that was going to allow us to collect and utilize administrative data.

1633
02:48:14,440 --> 02:48:17,979
How can we be creative about the way that we're approaching injury prevention and

1634
02:48:17,980 --> 02:48:20,980
what's going to work for the context and populations that are most interesting to me?

1635
02:48:21,400 --> 02:48:26,770
So I will throw some of those questions out. Folks want to respond to them as you're your reflection assignments.

1636
02:48:26,770 --> 02:48:29,829
I think that's great when you've gotten a couple of email addresses.

1637
02:48:29,830 --> 02:48:34,390
If you have any follow up interest for some of our speakers today, I'm sure they'd be happy to hear from you.

1638
02:48:34,600 --> 02:48:39,159
Let's talk a little bit more about their work. I encourage folks to attend the the panel today.

1639
02:48:39,160 --> 02:48:46,240
If you can't afford 30, say, tickets, that's going to be streamed. So you might go to watch it from your and also be recorded and shared later.

1640
02:48:46,420 --> 02:48:49,809
And so, you know what? I also think it's going to be recorded and shared later.

1641
02:48:49,810 --> 02:48:54,240
So I know you don't want to have to sign into perpetuity, but they never wanted anything inappropriate.

1642
02:48:54,670 --> 02:48:59,530
And maybe one more time. Yeah, that's great to have you here. I hope you all have a great weekend.

1643
02:48:59,530 --> 02:49:04,900
Go through this weekend. I just did my.
