1
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:06,610
So please.

2
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:12,390
We're almost done with this. Must be.

3
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:43,190
We're like people because somebody dropped the suit.

4
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:51,200
Absolutely unique. And that's why the people who get good.

5
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:54,280
So think it's. Just zeroing in on that.

6
00:01:55,180 --> 00:02:00,610
You think you can, but that's not covered for different concerts.

7
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:07,480
They don't have them. It's more like a Social Security personnel policy.

8
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:12,050
That's. So it's like two different things.

9
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:22,520
Yeah. Like, I'm going to get this that concert yesterday.

10
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:27,230
Oh, nice. Same dress. I, like, played in a concert.

11
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,570
Oh, my gosh. And in a dress rehearsal, those 2 hours.

12
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:36,250
And then went back and had lunch and then concert with another 2 hours.

13
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:47,680
So. It's weird.

14
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:11,750
Just by. They didn't already write the paragraph.

15
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:26,210
So on our slide, there's like a section like this emotional component, one or two paragraph overview of everything.

16
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:32,660
And then below it a couple paragraphs or you read it.

17
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:38,570
You look at your you look so much like her.

18
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:46,750
I'm so sorry. So you're so good getting someone like Cassie, too?

19
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:50,480
Yeah. She's like, I don't know.

20
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,890
I'm Jonathan. Very similar. I'm just.

21
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:07,520
It's one of those days, I feel like, because these things that you can create for someone else,

22
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,580
which I find that the slides we did for introductions for that for the year one class.

23
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:19,520
Just want to show your picture because.

24
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:39,510
Well, I feel like this part is it's super hard to here because I feel like once you have a model, it's pretty straightforward.

25
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:45,660
I love this book. I just I was really happy that there wasn't a lot of either.

26
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,920
Yeah, it was more just like, yeah, like, perfect.

27
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:54,350
Looks like it's completely rock. Yeah. Yeah.

28
00:04:56,210 --> 00:05:08,040
She talks about perceived threat. Oh, okay.

29
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:13,210
And she's kind of wanting to be vaccinated for her disease.

30
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:18,840
Oh, superfood. Because. Because those are the four weeks your.

31
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:23,180
But the health model isn't about behaviors.

32
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:28,970
It's about attitudes towards the actual disease. So I think we just I was going to say even just to.

33
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:49,070
And the socio ecological factors.

34
00:05:51,310 --> 00:06:02,510
Framing interventions is dangerous constructs, but it sounds like grave searching.

35
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:16,900
You know, maybe we can make that more. I think maybe the way we we arrange it will help, you know, because we think it's like a skill.

36
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:25,810
But really, she asks, what are integrated beliefs about the tissue I'm allergic to?

37
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:38,080
I don't know. Yeah. Not sure that makes sense.

38
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:43,600
At least in design. In describing what it's like for different interventions.

39
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:49,270
Three. Oh, yes, I think so.

40
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:56,290
Which for us, not really, because the two are kind of similar, like one and two and like three and four in this game kind,

41
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:04,090
it's going to break down like the same kind of box, but different interventions and self management skills.

42
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:14,740
Okay. To put.

43
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:26,680
There's nothing like some type of security treatment and and support program.

44
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:39,530
I don't know. Did you go to Albion? I don't think it is behavioral and it isn't very much is like on this assignment.

45
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:52,770
Oh, for sure. I mean, except for number two, I wouldn't comment on that behavior versus see what it was like.

46
00:07:52,810 --> 00:08:04,150
I get it off of me because was so scared for my female.

47
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:11,560
That's kind of what I would say. 690 if I was like somewhere like burnt out.

48
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:18,990
I did all that on my own. So once a year I'd go home like dresses,

49
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:29,470
like I was like my great really big girl to have like the other stuff doesn't have like benefits in primary care.

50
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,870
It is really something that I wouldn't have expected that.

51
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:39,580
Yeah, right. I was kind of similar where you rectums like you feel like you know,

52
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:48,880
could you do it all I really to to early detection that's kind of an idea that you train or like.

53
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:54,270
Yeah so it's like ideas as well. So like think that would be at the end of it.

54
00:08:55,070 --> 00:09:01,380
Did you guys like divide it up? We did. Based on, like the, um, like the critical one out.

55
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:06,730
There's like murders here. I did like one part of it and, like, drive out of it.

56
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:15,930
You write about your okay, we divided up like one of us did scoping screening and realistically well,

57
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:22,449
I didn't do I was just gonna do research because like I was trying to create like really looking at that.

58
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:25,820
You're like, if you think so, no, that's so good.

59
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:39,429
But the world over the next we're like, I'd probably do it, but I, it's just going to make it work during energy.

60
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:45,650
So it's landscape versus portrait that's just like the page that we ended up pasting it onto.

61
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:49,780
Yeah, I think. Yeah. Which I was like, That's fine.

62
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:54,580
I'm happy to do it. I would love to do it. Would be great. Yeah.

63
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,090
No, that's yeah, that one was funny to me because I was like, Yeah, it's just I can taste it.

64
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:09,190
But yeah, I'm just on that one where she's like, Why's asthma diagnosis?

65
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:13,480
It's own outcome. Because that's why. Well, so we kind of talked about that.

66
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:17,410
Yeah, we like talked about it together. However, like, that's why we didn't fight it.

67
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:32,770
So, so, I mean, we just, um, I guess that's the thing.

68
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:40,580
I want to start with policy here.

69
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:46,300
So when you're looking at all the polls that we want to finish,

70
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:54,910
I like to just it would just be one huge parking spot because it would be outcomes with like the two types of outcomes and like those.

71
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:01,530
So I think our first version, just figuring out which countries are.

72
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,819
I think that was like the biggest part that she kind of mentioned.

73
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:18,980
It's just like you sure mentioned self-efficacy or just going towards one outcome is the outcomes,

74
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:27,220
but which at first, I think the number of which drive the lowest, I think is the news.

75
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:49,390
I just duplicated. Placing it in the box and making it so it could just do one box of some diagnosis.

76
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:58,089
Not to understand. Establish a proximal and distal. I'll be one. We need to find her.

77
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:09,940
Seems like she said something to me because I think we're trying to hone in on them, which makes them it's different.

78
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:17,180
Struggling guard causing these. Yeah. So they're taking that that's like personalized risk which I know we talked about that.

79
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,560
Yeah, I think so. Yeah.

80
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:26,390
Author seems impossibility now sitting there native.

81
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:38,050
How can you include a super random photo?

82
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:53,680
Can we also put the health outcomes like asthma diagnosis in that same boxer with that?

83
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:57,310
Yeah, I think so. I think that's one of them. Yeah.

84
00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:01,329
And then all the arrows would point to this just one area between.

85
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:07,450
Yes. Surgeries and health outcome is on the same outcome sometimes.

86
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:17,410
Yeah. So just looking at. Yeah. I do think folding stuff to.

87
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:38,060
Of. Discussions.

88
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:43,870
Kids in school. Yeah. Okay. Wow.

89
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:48,210
Wow. That's exciting. I didn't know that.

90
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:54,690
I mean, I guess that makes sense. And.

91
00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:01,410
I don't know. I was told. You have something.

92
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:15,210
Yeah, me too. She's trying to box me out.

93
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:34,080
Yeah. I mean, like, if you really, you know, for example, she just.

94
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:58,230
He just takes it just like she doesn't know how to think.

95
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:10,649
And so I think that to all that, you go to that area, although, like the barriers to training and what it's talking about,

96
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:16,440
how we have to select for constructs like this one is here this and then this one is still being made.

97
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:26,970
Yes, that makes sense. Right. Because it's still all going towards things that we should make.

98
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:37,670
Okay. So we've written on self-efficacy, perceived susceptibility or see very something maybe like,

99
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:42,209
you know, take, you know, like subscription or treatment.

100
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:46,980
Like I think that's really important.

101
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:53,010
I was also confused by her comment about some other susceptibles that they.

102
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:57,230
Yeah, because I don't think it's really on what she means.

103
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:03,270
I mean, it is in the sense that I think maybe what works structure may be in place or but also

104
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:07,660
like what are the benefits to trying to overcome those barriers and face impacts?

105
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:12,400
You're really similar because.

106
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:19,320
Well, I don't think it looks super separate. And I think that's just like the antecedents of the same assumption can help both.

107
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:25,950
Like how? I don't know. I mean it's like, I dunno, are doing two different models.

108
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:32,190
I think it's just like those who are going into. Is that. Yeah me too.

109
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:36,450
Yeah. That was the one. When I read it I was like, I don't know, man.

110
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:40,370
Can you explain this double arrow? Good.

111
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:47,880
W So I was more like getting listed on the for it because like,

112
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:54,810
I guess you could technically just do straight because you're proximity to the industry, you know?

113
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:59,760
So yeah, it's like the time in industrial regulations, those can like cycle.

114
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:07,239
Well, I feel like it could just be st too. Yeah.

115
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:12,760
Especially for using things like. Yeah.

116
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:29,250
Yeah. I think policy like that, it going to be a one sided arrow because we're saying that to see them.

117
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:44,590
I think so. I feel like if we changed it three times, he probably points to this because environmental exposures like the main thing,

118
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:52,670
like that's like everything centers around. We said antecedent was background and policy and.

119
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:59,620
That it was pretty much that makes sense.

120
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:05,620
So that's like the main thing. And then it goes from there. Because she knew.

121
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:17,350
I mean, I think, like when we're doing like racial segregation, residential segregation, that doesn't mean it's good, I think, does it?

122
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,540
Interplays, okay.

123
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:26,780
Because like the more it looks like one group somewhere it becomes more segregated and then it kind of just yeah, that's something you yeah.

124
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:34,839
You just change people's like your adherence to it and the one what do you mean?

125
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:41,140
Like cost of an inhaler, which again, is what I'm saying.

126
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:45,580
Yeah. I mean, I guess the big thing is like that's a good question.

127
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:54,110
Are constructs like it's like costing the insurance is what's in here, but also the costs that you're taking on it.

128
00:18:54,190 --> 00:19:01,390
Yeah, I remember saying to the insurance companies, this homeowner's insurance the real distance.

129
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,340
I'm asking your question because like you make a good point.

130
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:10,840
If we want to try to influence treatment adherence that's under skills.

131
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:20,970
So yes, I think I don't know because it being in the model it's like he means in an action like adherence with the.

132
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:39,380
Do you think the above labels are enough?

133
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:47,030
I don't think she wants because I think that was the one where it seems like the moderating tools, you know, I think another name for the kitchen.

134
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:54,860
Yeah. Like, what else do you label that box just to distinguish themselves?

135
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:00,500
Right. Yeah.

136
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:07,100
I feel like that's a problem. All the stuff we mentioned is what she mentioned, and we already knew.

137
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:29,330
I mean, maybe it's like, oh, what about do we have, like, ninja kind of self-efficacy someone or motivation to do that?

138
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:35,600
But I mean, it could be really like I feel like she doesn't want to it like public health is.

139
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:43,220
Or maybe it's like addresses a shorter version of like two families have for mitigating their risk factors like personality.

140
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:48,439
Yeah. Prevention. I just the directions.

141
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,800
And this convention is too much intervention.

142
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:56,930
Oh, yeah. So eventually we have to integrate it into one.

143
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:02,020
Feel like this has been struggling with this.

144
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:07,440
I don't know. It's just that. Okay.

145
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:15,900
He took us all out. We talked about what were some of the options for intervention.

146
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:27,160
Is there intervention in the small? Because if these things are essentially going to be our intervention, that would follow.

147
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:31,250
Your intervention doesn't go into this model, but in theory, it's like based on the like.

148
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:38,010
So is that sort of what we're trying to say in this call is that these interventions with what I think we were trying to get some behavioral stuff in.

149
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:43,230
Yeah. Like intervention tools like probably not high.

150
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:49,790
So maybe it's not necessary, but it is.

151
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,260
It's it's hard. That's literally like what we're targeting, you know, intervention.

152
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:03,860
So I don't know where.

153
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:10,610
So I like alliteration.

154
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:25,390
All right. Which ruins.

155
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:38,260
Education. But that's what I was thinking.

156
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,260
Individuals and families, schools and education.

157
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:47,780
Oh, are we putting. I'm just listing the ideas that we had for these things.

158
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:56,390
And maybe we can figure out that all the things that encompasses some or all of these.

159
00:22:57,110 --> 00:23:04,489
Yeah. I mean, what does that mean when she says insurance determines the cost of inhalers and hospitalizations more directly than our

160
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:18,410
demographic factors like access to primary new tracks you mentioned because your income does make it kind of hard.

161
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:22,460
Yeah. You like having those all in one box?

162
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:28,880
Because we have those. We have primary care visits, like your income determines your insurance, which then returns those cost of things.

163
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:33,830
So if you don't cut insurance in on structure because insurance is in the barriers instead of the background.

164
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:38,100
Yeah. So maybe. But insurance too.

165
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:44,810
I think either that or insurance gets to increase annual primary care visits because it does insurance.

166
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:50,180
You know, I mean, we could it would just go like right in the middle, right?

167
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:57,320
Yeah. I mean, we could we it like it handles insurance status, right.

168
00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:01,730
Yeah. Because they can. I mean, I just I don't think that goes in the first place.

169
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:16,040
You know, I think that's like really perceived barriers, like a box of insurance is going as like a moderating or that there's that group to go to.

170
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:22,320
Yeah, yeah. I think definitely one of the gross situations too.

171
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:30,380
Yeah. So if we did that, it feels like a big problem for our little model.

172
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:36,920
Something we can actually change in education.

173
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:52,459
Yeah. Yeah. I think that marry a perceived susceptibility road consulting question mark.

174
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:55,940
Educating question mark. Yeah. Would it cancel? Like what was in your mind?

175
00:24:55,940 --> 00:25:04,020
Neuro consulting. Like health consulting, I guess it's sort of like counseling or like.

176
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:11,240
Yeah, yeah. Kind of the same as or like, you know, like the support group here.

177
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:23,720
I mean, I think, yeah, we look at the intervention column like could we introduce support groups that income management service together.

178
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:28,310
That's great. Like you like it ties to income scale in a way.

179
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:33,950
But if it doesn't go off though, I mean, maybe it's like I don't know how transportation fits into that.

180
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:39,230
Right. And then yeah. So delete the would take it out of that.

181
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:52,730
Yeah. I mean that's just what I know. I feel like that would make more sense to put all the money together or like in education, you know,

182
00:25:53,100 --> 00:26:06,889
I think you could have support groups that also would be doing the education, which is like making an integrated first or second.

183
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:10,190
You have a bunch of education and then you have people working together.

184
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:13,910
Do you think we got rid of the thing?

185
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:26,760
I wonder if there's a way we could, like, incorporate the background to make some sort of benefit or incentive to like participating in good programs,

186
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:33,200
long term memory care and information benefit institutions like those benefits don't come from that.

187
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:44,839
We have a waiver agreement waiver for a of one time when I don't think that if people

188
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:53,360
could be provided little bit how great it's like doing that changes they say like yeah,

189
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:58,880
let's have the battle for like a year and stuff.

190
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:02,870
I mean, there could be financial barriers to treatment and social barriers to treatment.

191
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:07,640
We could have information technology, social. That's true.

192
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:14,590
And then and it was impressive how many people knew they were getting something.

193
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:22,969
Yeah. If you're working with a bunch of adults, it makes a big difference because like theoretically we're trying to engage or

194
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:27,290
within this box we could just sign it if we want to have different answers to them,

195
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:32,090
history or present smoking behavior, or we're trying to get them.

196
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:38,840
Early onset of our rights and we have to.

197
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:42,550
Somehow it came from somewhere that dissipating.

198
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:49,219
Yeah, I know. I work for them and I think you got there's like a long term component, right?

199
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:52,220
But like, people care more about Instagram.

200
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:59,270
Yeah, I like that.

201
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:06,430
Smokers are there.

202
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:12,140
You know, there's like a is it like a smoker expression? Should we put asthma first?

203
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:23,090
Because like we're doing asthma prevention of the environment, we just look at them and wonder if there's something I like to look like.

204
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:28,219
I'm wondering if like that's a, like a forum through which we could do it.

205
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:34,049
Your that's not prevention. We're suggesting like in a place where people are doing the prevention,

206
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:43,190
the be environmentally just because if it's like an aim to the black population like have to make early detection like you're trained like prevent it.

207
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,880
So I guess maybe to rectify this.

208
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:55,700
So if you already have people in place where they're trying to quit and maybe that's like a she's going to still say it's boring,

209
00:28:58,130 --> 00:29:01,340
boring like I'm doing the punch.

210
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:15,020
I don't know if there's like a I'm just so nicotine there's quit lines, tobacco quit lines.

211
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:27,970
And then you get the ones where it's like literally 30 words in the title and it's like, why are you driving a car?

212
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:34,340
And they people start smoking for liquid.

213
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:37,610
So you're putting an arrow between and social barriers.

214
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:43,010
And then so you go to the guy next to her nicotine.

215
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:47,810
Okay, I get the stagger.

216
00:29:49,280 --> 00:30:07,530
So I guess like it's a little bit different because if you're like me trying to have a job because that's not what I do,

217
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:16,940
I smoke, but I might as well as maybe smoke like you're using.

218
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:20,960
Can you do landscape on just one word document?

219
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:29,000
Yeah, you can. Like I was thinking that I'm going to do relationship with someone like an attorney there.

220
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:36,500
Yeah. But like, I think that to turn it in your mind.

221
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:49,730
So I, you know, I don't know that I'm always I mean, I think it might be the hardest part of it.

222
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:56,750
There you go. All right. I hear that. I think this is like I think that was even.

223
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:08,660
Yeah, that was a subject. So interest just truly and I really don't want it to be.

224
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:15,380
What do you think about. Yeah, you go and have drinks with people, but generally you don't want to know.

225
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:26,570
It's crazy. My wife was an alcoholic, but I feel like that really does incorporate everything she said so long as she can't cover well.

226
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:34,490
We did something like that and similarly like yeah, we do.

227
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:42,730
Anyway, I'm sure that is just because it's acceptable in different.

228
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:53,300
Right. I'm not, I don't I take it I'm living that I mean smoking is obviously as my allergies are every

229
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:57,730
small and I keep thinking it's a cold and I go outside and my eyes are so I'm like,

230
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:07,590
no reason for I think it's Wrigley and yeah, it's also I think the wind and I think people like blow their leaves.

231
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:13,240
So then you get everything, but they do it right of me too. I can walk you like, oh yeah.

232
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:16,729
And people don't. They just make you walk through it.

233
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:22,220
I think, oh, it's personality altering. And they're like, I mean, I really can't handle this ruin.

234
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:32,210
Like, I'm just simply going to be like a kid at like, back slapping, and I would just be like, kind of lose my voice, like my eyes.

235
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:36,510
Superintelligent at this moment is really stupid.

236
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:44,250
So I need access to health and wellness coaching.

237
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:49,200
Well, this has incumbents in there.

238
00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:53,450
So that definitely does determine it and alcohol.

239
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:59,920
But does your insurance background is going to be an intervention?

240
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:05,750
Because it would take time to learn how to like.

241
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:10,770
Use preventative care, I guess similar to her comment to me.

242
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:14,549
Yeah, they do. It's just hard to put insurance in there. Yeah.

243
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:20,310
Yeah, because if insurance was just in the background, that would make like I was a citizen support group, you know,

244
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:25,380
or even if they, if they were like maybe there is a support group, like maybe that is the link to the sport.

245
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:34,800
Maybe it's like if somebody comes in to just come and fix a financial problem to treat, you know, we're interested in insurance,

246
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:45,750
there's like either some additional education and take out the cost of hospitalization, I guess, you know, putting it back into like actually.

247
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:52,620
But interesting would be I think insurance studies is kind of of do you think your mom is coaching her?

248
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:55,950
You lose your insurance employment.

249
00:33:56,130 --> 00:34:03,040
When we do this presentation, I feel like you can have like a like income and just completely matter.

250
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:07,320
If you said your intervention as well as coaching, I think you mostly get it when you start.

251
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:15,350
Yeah. Like would it be through like university wellness coaching programs that are pre established and like we'd add something to it in

252
00:34:15,390 --> 00:34:23,400
the back and background and then leave insurance that is something like so what about like if we can get kids involved as well?

253
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:32,600
Because I like to think we're underwriting to start a coaching because that's part of history too.

254
00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:46,950
So your income well family so because people have a hard time like yeah detection and like screening and like it's not like directly back to the.

255
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:52,530
Yeah. See I don't know actually. Yeah I really would go either way.

256
00:34:52,770 --> 00:34:58,020
Yeah. I feel like both of them could just go on background and just have like one arrow to finance on that one.

257
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:04,559
The social stigma of racial interviewing actually would, because technically your insurance status is your back now,

258
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,870
and it's not like you're coming into this with insurance.

259
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:12,160
We're not sure how much you think I should have a hard time putting insurance that is like the same box.

260
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:18,060
Like you hear. Like these are both. But I mean, I guess when someone white people are your best friend is very different.

261
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:25,320
Very different. Improve their wellness even if they don't know in exactly what ways do we think?

262
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:31,230
Yeah, I feel like just having that box in the middle to get to that point and then you take it from there.

263
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:36,030
And the problem with the way it is right now is that we don't know whether there should be a box from financial backers to both.

264
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:41,850
I think, yeah, because I don't I don't think insurance would go to an anonymous thing.

265
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:45,930
Like I think insurance would go to I think they need support through solid ground.

266
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:49,710
Make that decision there like in the action or whatever.

267
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:55,200
Do you remember there was that one class where she shows like the stages of like people's intention.

268
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:59,130
Like the first stage was like people don't think they have a problem, so they're not willing to.

269
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:06,870
What if I put like, well, like you've income make it okay.

270
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:15,770
I was like thinking of wealth as a more static thing so we wouldn't have to have that other area because we would go towards that.

271
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:19,020
Yeah, cause I know that goes back because income wealth is kind of.

272
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:23,160
Right. You know, trying to address people who don't.

273
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:28,020
I think that's got to be a problem. All right.

274
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:36,450
So what do we do for the intervention? Like if they just have our age?

275
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:42,830
I think they showed it with your med school or their training. Oh, yeah.

276
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,400
They should all go together. Right.

277
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:50,790
I think that's why the other one was and I can share it with you, because I went back to the question of how that kind of it.

278
00:36:56,460 --> 00:37:05,970
And it's just screaming. It's just like it's like Google account opening or something like that.

279
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:09,340
You mash or something, and then they both go to the same email.

280
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:17,280
It's just very unnecessarily difficult. Google Except when it's nonstop, it's not.

281
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:22,290
I'm like, We don't have a Gmail account. We only have the outlook.

282
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:28,590
But if you want to set up the image, a good document, Gmail account, you can go through a whole process.

283
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:39,070
I don't quite understand you. I just. Well, yeah, but it isn't like designer screening or, like, education to address the constructs.

284
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:44,770
It just happened in one setting. Would that take place and everything?

285
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:49,910
So that be like, oh yeah.

286
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:54,360
I just put like the same information. I just. Oh, is isn't anything.

287
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:59,640
Okay. Sorry. That's it? Yeah. No, because I was like, I don't want to have to go because I never know how to find it.

288
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:07,920
It's because you should watch interviews and stuff is like education programs to really show screening and education.

289
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:13,560
Okay, I just found that our primary care.

290
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:20,160
Yeah. That was another thing. Yes. Maybe try.

291
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:27,100
Well, because we don't need it to in the end we need to do AMA somehow pushing doubt about that or not.

292
00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:34,090
So I kind of want to still just put that part for now, but then at the end we can figure out AMA, okay,

293
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:40,960
because I don't think that really matters right now because it's not like reciting anything like this.

294
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:47,680
So just put that aside. If we could do something through that piece and I was thinking of making a documentary

295
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:52,390
assembly this week as well for like the final because it's just all the stuff together.

296
00:38:53,680 --> 00:39:04,030
So probably like start doing like mutually this role for Constance so we need to do

297
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:07,950
is complete this movie and so through a doctor's office doing it throughout the year.

298
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:09,550
Q Interesting. I was like,

299
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:19,270
it's so weird and already has construction here for Medical Center because those were the and those are kind of the only ones you can

300
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:27,280
really interview that I had this exciting possible time opening transportation and like there's a future in the schools in schools here,

301
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:30,750
which is apparently a thing they did with school, something that we talked about. Yeah,

302
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:42,850
I've always said that you are going to do that and I thinking uhc but like talking about like like air air filtration systems and population and yeah,

303
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:47,890
so at least if they're not at home, they're getting there. It's going to fit our profile.

304
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:53,299
That's like air filters, maybe like a two pronged one, it's like in homes and like in schools.

305
00:39:53,300 --> 00:40:00,280
So it's kind of and workplaces because once you've seen something about like intake too, it's like don't panic too.

306
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:04,209
I think especially in like I think I think that was thanks to freeways.

307
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:09,120
Never mind that it's hot. I mean, it's not not but yeah.

308
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:09,459
Yeah.

309
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:20,550
I mean, I think education or refer them to like a virtual thing, we don't have to deal with that to just if anything because we get like education.

310
00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:28,090
So yeah, I guess like what would be our intervention activities or industrial research?

311
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:35,060
That's hard, like because policy matters, but it's more like what do you do like teams.

312
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:48,500
So. I mean, we just have like harsher regulations versus like zoning is more like you don't put a house next to polluting.

313
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:54,090
I think that's kind of a difference between this very broad industrial regulation you're seeing

314
00:40:54,090 --> 00:41:00,830
laced with the cumulative risk is like lower standards or like increased standards for all of them.

315
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:08,210
So like altogether slower. And we're not like hunting really, and we're just like an hour away.

316
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:12,980
And so to censor, like what are interventions like are we advocating?

317
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:17,060
I think that's what any like bring into it is running an advocacy campaign.

318
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:24,710
Yeah so like people can be like, hey, we want stricter regulation because I think all of these are like people.

319
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:27,960
So like even with zoning, it can be much stricter zoning. Yeah.

320
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:36,150
Because like the government should be listening to people obviously. So we're trying to build for the big, you know,

321
00:41:36,810 --> 00:41:46,730
it's like Excedrin like so I have things when like a storm system is coming

322
00:41:46,730 --> 00:41:53,080
in then and it was like that like subsidies from the government from filter.

323
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:56,809
Yeah. Like created to give them of can we install them.

324
00:41:56,810 --> 00:42:03,410
I don't know how what are they. How do they work. Do you have to put them in. I think you do need to put a in and it's a payment to buy it.

325
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:06,700
Yeah. My landlord comes and changes. That's.

326
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:17,440
Well, yeah, because if you do subsidy, like if they go out and buy their own, you can like pay it back like a rebate.

327
00:42:18,430 --> 00:42:26,110
Yeah. To address it. Well, yeah, because if it costs too much, you're not buying it.

328
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:30,280
Yeah. And you wouldn't install it anymore.

329
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:35,800
Yeah. Like that'll be part of the distribution as you go around with so and install it.

330
00:42:35,890 --> 00:42:38,890
Not just be like here buying these.

331
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:45,990
Yeah. So it's a support group also.

332
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:52,410
I don't think so, because I think that's really problematic because a community program,

333
00:42:53,210 --> 00:43:01,870
whatever is like a way to connect with people in the community like all the different rather than like running it.

334
00:43:01,910 --> 00:43:12,570
It was like a way to create like support groups for people who really like communities and yeah, like, not just like telling individuals be like, oh.

335
00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:15,700
Like, bring them all together. Well, I'm like, yeah.

336
00:43:15,730 --> 00:43:23,020
Like trying to create a community groups that like people who have found good people for different things and like I'm an app is to get treatment.

337
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:27,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

338
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:31,470
Integrate into education.

339
00:43:32,770 --> 00:43:40,680
One various utility transportation I guess to diabetes.

340
00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:44,559
But to your health. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's a great.

341
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:51,980
That's great. And turn and use common sense.

342
00:43:52,110 --> 00:44:04,800
Common. And I mean, I want to know, I just I was just saying that I'm never going to have the educational program.

343
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:15,580
Yeah. Oh, one thing you just said to me, because a lot of these are like such like logical re situation, personal,

344
00:44:15,610 --> 00:44:24,110
like what you can do for things like policy or anything like that, where you can kind of like who's doing it?

345
00:44:24,390 --> 00:44:28,530
Like the community or like organization can be part of it as well.

346
00:44:28,530 --> 00:44:34,110
So. Right. Facilitating this also like interpersonal political parties and stuff.

347
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:37,380
Wouldn't be doing anything else we need to do in this.

348
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:49,170
Like maybe because I think that one yeah it's not really you don't so intervene on your like thinking somebody comes to like this is like they all had

349
00:44:49,170 --> 00:44:55,649
really qualified for what I like this because to be like you can't just be

350
00:44:55,650 --> 00:45:06,710
like stop being poor but yes smoking as you could see how much they got clean,

351
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:13,050
like additional education that we want to provide. Is it like.

352
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:21,889
Is it that there's somebody on site who has already that's on standby to

353
00:45:21,890 --> 00:45:25,700
provide this education or is it coming from the doctor they're already seeing?

354
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:28,459
So where does the doctor provide some education?

355
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:38,140
And that connects them to a support group that maybe is peer led and involves some more of the specific skill building and motivational interviewing.

356
00:45:38,190 --> 00:45:41,599
Yes. I'm not clear on if we're supposed to be going for interventions. Yeah.

357
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:48,080
I mean, I feel like it's a relatively new one intervention that addresses for an abstract, specific, really strong one.

358
00:45:48,230 --> 00:45:51,960
I think so too. Yeah.

359
00:45:51,980 --> 00:46:01,010
So we can't this can't be something that takes a doctor and also our like the intervention can to have like multiple prongs for.

360
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:06,680
So like if we look at like a conceptual model, your intervention is supposed to go somewhere in it,

361
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:11,170
you know, why does behavioral beliefs model normative?

362
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:17,430
And you just have to explain like, why is that relevant? It's like in my group explaining like that,

363
00:46:17,510 --> 00:46:24,139
I have to explain the twice completed self competency of a 4 to 12 year old relevant for access to care support.

364
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:31,010
The kid is not information. The kid is not internet. They might think they might believe like they're doing everything in their power.

365
00:46:31,850 --> 00:46:38,309
They might not be. And so by giving a positive spin, by making it beneficial to them and giving it a different perspective,

366
00:46:38,310 --> 00:46:42,530
not guilting the using some consideration theory, that's what I'm doing.

367
00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:54,060
That's you. My understanding is my 4 to 4 interventions is a lot of what we're doing is motivational interviewing skills.

368
00:46:54,110 --> 00:46:57,120
They can all be an intervention in like one thing, right?

369
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:06,500
It's like you kind of have one central thing, you know, were you like, how are we going to be advocates and educate and perceived barriers?

370
00:47:06,710 --> 00:47:14,990
Are we addressing important? Yeah. In education, like you partner with the government.

371
00:47:14,990 --> 00:47:20,580
Yeah. You need get around this thing that includes one disturbing part of your culture

372
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:25,630
is in this religion because we're doing the two pronged approach right.

373
00:47:25,850 --> 00:47:34,250
This is all about weight that you see parents think the policy versus role transfiguration was a benchmark.

374
00:47:34,490 --> 00:47:38,840
Yeah, because we feel like this could only one intervention.

375
00:47:39,470 --> 00:47:46,430
We just need to see like how it's all related. I don't think we really change other shows.

376
00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:52,159
And these are actually some rooms where like maybe there are what is it?

377
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:59,870
Call it all one thing and then it will be okay, right? I mean, I think if we go back to like 18 oh, I've got this thing like support groups can,

378
00:48:01,310 --> 00:48:13,940
like they used or even if people in the community we in that way with them to create support groups and like some real positive habits.

379
00:48:14,090 --> 00:48:22,280
So like if we identify people in the community we use them and we see encourage the implementation of air filters.

380
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:29,749
Yeah. Like through their filters and then utilize those groups as like to build community

381
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:36,250
skills for advocacy to try to then down the line affect like zoning and regulations.

382
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:36,760
Yeah.

383
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:46,270
So you come to it like one central place, you learn about it, you start doing it because that's like immediate you actively just refer to like that.

384
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:53,270
So I think like our big intervention is like identifying people in the community and

385
00:48:53,300 --> 00:49:00,140
then like doing like it's more lot like empowering them to like support others.

386
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:07,560
Yeah. So I'm like we can have others sign up, but like having those people because I'm kind of just fully just dealing with Latino.

387
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:12,470
Yeah, I think can we make it a virtual yeah, it works.

388
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:22,100
So it could be something if they have to kind of rephrase how many clients they can access from their apartment.

389
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:31,150
We just explain. We're going to ask if you just like one, 2 hours on day one or two, but then because it's such intuition,

390
00:49:31,610 --> 00:49:38,719
like it's a like so to title to get you can kind of put whatever the table in front of you that are at a geographic distance

391
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:46,250
and like you're trying to have an outreach support group and emcee like there might be people that implies that like,

392
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:49,560
you know, like this mission for this specific population, right?

393
00:49:50,090 --> 00:50:00,410
So. Right. I mean, it gives us a little more control over how the support is facilitated.

394
00:50:40,790 --> 00:50:50,790
And good to do it with you.

395
00:50:51,710 --> 00:50:55,730
Yeah, because once you learn about this, you're not going to be like, okay. Like I have.

396
00:50:56,630 --> 00:51:01,160
You want to replace places? Yeah, but I mean, like, you have to identify people who have.

397
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:09,580
Do you have to advocate for, you know, more people, you know, in teaching about this, you know,

398
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:32,730
sometimes you can teach or since I just wasn't really a second ago, there will always be a of other to push for like seeking policy.

399
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:38,480
And you feel like you're on out.

400
00:51:38,510 --> 00:51:51,180
What? What what do we need to do? Basic think.

401
00:51:52,560 --> 00:52:04,640
Okay, so how are intervention attorneys representing representing.

402
00:52:07,410 --> 00:52:13,170
So we're not actually going to provide great awareness.

403
00:52:14,130 --> 00:52:19,820
Let's also deny that this is made up of the rich. Well, because that's part of it.

404
00:52:19,830 --> 00:52:27,650
You'll be like, here's the air filter. I grew out of pocket.

405
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:31,410
We'll buy it air filters for all of Detroit and how to install it.

406
00:52:31,410 --> 00:52:47,790
But it's amazing how old movies are installing new ways to like our air filters the most effective, but they are easiest to do on your own.

407
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:52,470
If you can't, you know, move away from a marathon station.

408
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:57,210
You know, this sort of thing, it's more like, what can you do about it?

409
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:05,500
It'd be a lot better to not live next to a highway in America. That's not an option for you.

410
00:53:05,650 --> 00:53:11,170
What about the TARDIS? I don't know. Yeah, but then I think you're getting back on a policy.

411
00:53:11,410 --> 00:53:17,470
Yeah. You can't just go. And without the conversation we just had, I don't know how much this is going to make sense to him.

412
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:22,980
Maybe we can meet up with him after five days, but I think that's under industrial regulation.

413
00:53:22,990 --> 00:53:27,940
I think that's part of it. Okay.

414
00:53:29,590 --> 00:53:34,630
Yeah. Okay. I mean, there's a lot of things that maybe he could help out.

415
00:53:35,830 --> 00:53:40,060
Cool. So basically.

416
00:53:40,450 --> 00:53:50,440
Yeah. I mean, you're right. And we need to fleshing out the table such this page or change or feel like we can answer that from.

417
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:57,610
I feel like once we do the paragraph, like however you want to word it, like in the table compared to it and the theory section.

418
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:05,890
Yeah. I want to become like already I'm thinking like, oh, inter-personal because it's interpersonal.

419
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:14,350
I'm thinking like an intro to like yourself.

420
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:18,520
Enter, like, inter intro.

421
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:23,890
Yeah, I know. Yeah. So there's nobody just like me myself in an article?

422
00:54:24,070 --> 00:54:30,820
Yeah. Just person. So I think this is inter.

423
00:54:31,150 --> 00:54:37,680
Yeah. And keep going back to, I think, you know, cause of the interaction with like we know that's no I mean,

424
00:54:37,690 --> 00:54:41,470
I guess because there is that individual level,

425
00:54:42,610 --> 00:54:49,330
I feel like it can be both where you're working together to talk about these things and then doing it yourself.

426
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:56,200
Yeah, but the install like the air filters would be like that's from yes, you can.

427
00:54:56,830 --> 00:55:15,300
Yes. Because it's not like it is just the presentation was a final project which we have everything just, you know, these are all the components.

428
00:55:15,310 --> 00:55:20,030
There's no writing. This is the last component design or.

429
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:27,160
So yeah, I mean it's we were weeks so yeah.

430
00:55:28,510 --> 00:55:33,460
That's kind of what was happening. Yeah.

431
00:55:34,690 --> 00:55:38,470
Okay. And then we don't resubmit our conceptual. We're just going to keep working.

432
00:55:38,770 --> 00:55:44,229
Really? Yeah. I think it's just, I mean, like the final, you know, interest of, of.

433
00:55:44,230 --> 00:55:50,710
Yeah. So we can always ask her. Yeah.

434
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:55,570
I think she did see like along the way, but. Yeah.

435
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:59,750
Like support groups. Yeah.

436
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:19,150
Self-efficacy. Standing by for, like, connections to your readers and how we divide this up.

437
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:24,900
That's what those are with groups that you decided to do.

438
00:56:24,910 --> 00:56:29,140
We want to ask you to write your hair for sure.

439
00:56:29,230 --> 00:56:35,680
You need to. Either you want to take a stab at it and edit it.

440
00:56:35,830 --> 00:56:48,280
Yeah, I feel like that's always going to be like I mean, sometimes after we do it because we like it, it's so hard.

441
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:52,239
Yeah. Tear it apart. I used to do my music first.

442
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:55,870
It's just explaining what's going on. And I think so.

443
00:56:55,870 --> 00:57:00,790
Yeah. Explain it to me. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

444
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:09,879
She's at the end of the intervention with the statement of what theories or models are in form.

445
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:11,440
Because, like, how do we want to do something?

446
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:17,170
That's basically what we talking about where like I feel like tables are more like this population, but not all.

447
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:30,009
Like this is what would happen in this kind of refer to support, break it down as little virtual and allow people with our people to do maybe using.

448
00:57:30,010 --> 00:57:37,420
But then I'll get this done this afternoon. So if you want to like look at to write that and then yeah sure.

449
00:57:37,780 --> 00:57:51,700
Yeah. And I think that's theories are models that are informing it are sort of, you know, I'm going on the future,

450
00:57:52,060 --> 00:57:56,020
but then I'm like immediately driving back to the tree to meet up with my sister to drive to Canada.

451
00:57:56,290 --> 00:58:01,000
That's pretty funny. Yeah, like, just drop me off. And I was going, but then I went to my car.

452
00:58:01,450 --> 00:58:06,030
Yeah. Thank you. Yes, it's going to be very interesting, actually.

453
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:13,379
I know I'd like it to be good. And it seems to me like I've never really had or I think I have to go somewhere that.

454
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:16,380
Can you do this table at noon? I want to see the end of the day.

455
00:58:17,050 --> 00:58:22,320
I got to get on a bus with my whole class driver.

456
00:58:23,070 --> 00:58:29,310
We'll have, like, the little line that we all were walking. Walking, and it's going to lose.

457
00:58:32,610 --> 00:58:36,960
I was literally like, Oh, I think, okay. She gave us her number.

458
00:58:36,970 --> 00:58:41,129
How many do I have? Anyone else's number? So, like,

459
00:58:41,130 --> 00:58:45,840
if I could like she's going to come on your gross wondering what's up dropped you got to get on that that's part of the

460
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:52,710
problem is you should just ask by email you got to send in chronologically all this has been kind of tough for me.

461
00:58:52,740 --> 00:59:00,120
Can we just text you about it? Well, I didn't get it because Kate was the one was like or she was the next one.

462
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:03,720
She's like, oh, I have like three things. Yeah, I know. But it is interesting.

463
00:59:04,290 --> 00:59:12,299
Some like it it's just a sexual model or like and like maybe take a first pass of

464
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:17,010
the description soccer team is in the plans like figuring out a better ratio.

465
00:59:17,070 --> 00:59:20,400
It's just an interpreter. It's. Yeah.

466
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:24,750
I'm like, okay. I'm just like, oh, you're watching it, you know?

467
00:59:25,540 --> 00:59:33,719
I mean, I mostly watch some pretty bad ones in an email today.

468
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:38,610
Like, let's try to make sure everybody's getting equal amounts of playing time like football, like I'm I belong.

469
00:59:38,610 --> 00:59:48,000
I feel like I belong on the sidelines. Not I'll text you guys like I am so tired and like so scared of the ball coming to me.

470
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:54,540
Like, I don't want to be pieces and only if it's like I'm on the basketball team.

471
00:59:55,190 --> 01:00:04,079
I was like, man to man in his way. Like, that's all I got. And I hit with something, you know, I remember just like in middle school,

472
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:12,690
I honestly don't even come near me with the balls or if I was going to just like, I don't know, super don't.

473
01:00:12,690 --> 01:00:19,890
We don't have to go to everything. I do good work with you, just like.

474
01:00:20,190 --> 01:00:30,269
But I don't think I have the ability to not do it across this group.

475
01:00:30,270 --> 01:00:37,020
It's like, you know, it really has like, this is what it could be doing.

476
01:00:37,020 --> 01:00:43,919
It is literally just like talking about all your feelings.

477
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:46,590
I'm like, you know, they're not all that interesting.

478
01:00:47,790 --> 01:01:00,270
I feel like I'm doing very similar things and many of them are just like, oh six are you in six trying to come up for me that just like it's fine.

479
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:08,200
Like, it's totally fine. But it's not interesting. One of the gentlemen's requirements you don't need to know it's getting done.

480
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:17,159
I mean, I know if I said okay and then it was communication things that was you to me, I'm pretty sure I'm like, I'm going to fail.

481
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:22,889
Yeah, I really don't think you're going to like it. But also, like I, I just don't think you will find it really fast.

482
01:01:22,890 --> 01:01:31,560
And you talk to somebody talking about how they're not going to like every I've talked to the guy at least like 16 is what I heard.

483
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:35,350
He's got a 20 year that's really close.

484
01:01:35,820 --> 01:01:41,970
I do think it the second one was out of 2012. Most people I talked to like that was my only concern.

485
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:45,950
I don't know because I think the first one was ten.

486
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:49,200
Yeah, that's the one I think. Oh the two.

487
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:54,140
Yeah. The with land and yeah.

488
01:01:54,180 --> 01:01:57,480
The other one and the. Yeah, yeah.

489
01:01:58,260 --> 01:02:01,380
Well to the wedding which is for me. Yeah, yeah.

490
01:02:01,470 --> 01:02:07,790
I asked this man for a letter on Thursday. It was the most it is for the doorbell.

491
01:02:08,370 --> 01:02:11,600
Oh cool. I emailed Amy and she never responded. Oh my girl.

492
01:02:11,610 --> 01:02:19,559
He would have. She just emailed me right now and she's like, wait, I'm like talking to him face to face.

493
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:24,880
And he's like and he's like, I guess he's kind of dude.

494
01:02:25,330 --> 01:02:29,489
It's like, I feel like it's just like if you just kind of a being like, I think he's just,

495
01:02:29,490 --> 01:02:36,030
like, doesn't have a social history because he's, like, very unnecessarily, like, harsh.

496
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:45,749
Yeah. You know, like, it was very much like, I got I'm going so I can see him and go like, I just needed a letter.

497
01:02:45,750 --> 01:02:49,770
But he never said yes.

498
01:02:49,770 --> 01:02:58,319
Technically he was trying to make sure that same issue for five because he was like very good looking at that discussion section.

499
01:02:58,320 --> 01:03:01,830
Yeah, it was so strange and.

500
01:03:01,860 --> 01:03:06,660
Of course, people stayed after class to ask questions still about the death of my daughter.

501
01:03:06,810 --> 01:03:14,010
So I was there until like 1015. Like let me out is not going to like, would you dear them?

502
01:03:16,110 --> 01:03:21,300
Oh, with birth control. So what you're doing the one. I'm like, okay, I need something simple.

503
01:03:21,450 --> 01:03:26,500
It's like, I'm not struggling to find a couple on couple. I struggled to find.

504
01:03:26,970 --> 01:03:30,360
What did you do? Because it's been a business for real, seemingly all day Wednesday.

505
01:03:30,380 --> 01:03:38,970
Other I mean, it was honestly. So there's like all this data, but it's all like in there, you know, it's all [INAUDIBLE] odds ratios and risk ratios.

506
01:03:38,970 --> 01:03:44,130
So it's all like it's when you're 20% less likely. But like he was like he was like, you have to have a number on each one.

507
01:03:44,310 --> 01:03:49,709
So like, my numbers are terrible, but he's like, make em up and very uncomfortable with that, which is stupid.

508
01:03:49,710 --> 01:03:55,290
But it was true. So that I was like looking up the average rate and then I was like, and it's 20% less than that.

509
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:59,040
No, we're just garbage numbers. That's stupid. Well, mine.

510
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:02,710
It was more like a range. It's like, oh, it's like this to this.

511
01:04:02,730 --> 01:04:11,790
So for like one of them, I do like the median and the other one the mean there's honestly like I did my best

512
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:15,960
looking stuff because like that's what they do is like there's a bunch of studies.

513
01:04:16,260 --> 01:04:19,290
So they give you the range of like what all the studies said, yeah, it's the rage.

514
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:24,060
But then they like, you know, patience and you're like, well, there's a 66 to 40%.

515
01:04:25,050 --> 01:04:29,610
You okay? That's what I was struggling with. Cause, like everything else.

516
01:04:30,250 --> 01:04:36,510
Yeah, I don't want to do that. And they feel like I know he said only two, but being like, Oh, there's only two.

517
01:04:37,050 --> 01:04:43,170
I'm like, This is just so and you can pay him for that. It was the injection versus just the pill.

518
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:47,300
Okay. The seven year college just is, like, not horrible.

519
01:04:48,390 --> 01:04:56,190
So you've decided against it? Yeah, but even though that was more like the pills that you did, she did like the two different ideas.

520
01:04:56,290 --> 01:05:06,629
Yeah. It would have been easier to just kind of, you know, you could also, like, Canada has like, various copper ideas about food.

521
01:05:06,630 --> 01:05:09,860
When she did, it was the copper versus just the hormonal. No.

522
01:05:09,890 --> 01:05:16,290
Yeah, but I've seen things like in America there's only one copper and there's different hormonal Canada there's many copper.

523
01:05:16,410 --> 01:05:20,190
Yeah. But in theory, the first decision you're making is like, you're going to get the copper.

524
01:05:20,190 --> 01:05:24,310
Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. That's what you sign the dotted line.

525
01:05:24,540 --> 01:05:27,180
I mean, it's all sort of arbitrary. He doesn't actually care about the information.

526
01:05:27,270 --> 01:05:31,860
So I went to two pages, though, and like, I had no idea outside of the table.

527
01:05:32,070 --> 01:05:38,140
What do I know? So I think about it. I feel like an ethical thing where I'm like, This is the question you might have me.

528
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:41,730
Here's the answer. Like, there's kind of one off the prostate thing, that's what.

529
01:05:42,210 --> 01:05:45,530
But I really think that 48 is like we really would prefer,

530
01:05:46,740 --> 01:05:56,100
I don't know I got really like this is bad definitely organized because like when it goes on the medical stuff like it's just like,

531
01:05:57,400 --> 01:06:05,400
you know, so like every now and then I just try to I'm just try to let it go or you can't work on this.

532
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:10,440
It's just it's like, you know, that is because I feel like I've understood the lessons I'm supposed to understand.

533
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:15,020
Here you go. Take it. I'm like, I learned what I needed to.

534
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:21,390
It was good just for you. That's big. That's why it was cool.

535
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:25,080
You have a good day, you know? See you tomorrow. I'll see you tomorrow.

536
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:40,740
I figured out how to get her to me.

537
01:06:41,250 --> 01:06:44,490
I think so, yeah.

538
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:48,060
Personally, I always think it's better to meet in person when possible.

539
01:06:48,570 --> 01:07:16,960
Yea. Yea. Yea. Yeah. That looks like at one moment.

540
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:22,340
Yeah, I it was just like right when we sat down and went, okay, let's just get to it.

541
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:27,460
I don't know. They didn't see. I was like, Oh, I think this can just be summarized in reverse.

542
01:07:27,470 --> 01:07:30,530
And someone was like, Well, I think you should just write your paragraph and we can meet tomorrow.

543
01:07:30,530 --> 01:07:34,700
And I'm like, We're not meeting. And I'm just like, your passive aggression.

544
01:07:34,700 --> 01:07:37,880
I'm going to be like, just like, No, you're wrong. I'm going.

545
01:07:38,660 --> 01:07:42,770
People think passive aggressive is like, okay. And I'm like, just be direct between that.

546
01:07:42,770 --> 01:07:48,560
You don't want to have to rewrite your section, know. Yeah. Or that our model isn't the most accurate.

547
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:56,270
And that's what I mean. It's not supposed to be perfect anyway or you know, or first year salary.

548
01:07:56,840 --> 01:08:00,260
Yeah. First you're selling funds for salary. Okay. Yeah.

549
01:08:01,070 --> 01:08:12,500
Once I'm out of school, sure, I'll work into it. I then like it's different I think I just wish people were like, I'm still using my job.

550
01:08:12,620 --> 01:08:17,600
I'm like, No, I did my section and I'm like, They're covering a lot of the same thing.

551
01:08:17,940 --> 01:08:36,430
It is what it is, and I love that you love it because that's like my favorite, I guess I've heard it's not like there's not much you can do about it.

552
01:08:36,490 --> 01:08:43,140
That's just mean, literally. What is what are you going to stress about it for once?

553
01:08:43,250 --> 01:08:48,170
And yeah, like cosmology projects, like, oh yeah, stressing doesn't kill you anymore.

554
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:54,830
So I'm saying don't all that. But it's, it's always easier said than done.

555
01:08:55,070 --> 01:09:01,730
Oh, yeah. I'll let me stay on as a dude. Good luck with you.

556
01:09:02,390 --> 01:09:05,510
Thank you. At least it's due Friday. It's not like, you know.

557
01:09:06,380 --> 01:09:10,280
[INAUDIBLE], I don't want to fight for that. That's my thing.

558
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:16,520
It's like I know where they're at. I know who these people are, and God bless.

559
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:21,320
Yeah. I feel like we're all in the same class.

560
01:09:22,070 --> 01:09:26,120
Like, we can't, like, stop seeing each other.

561
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:30,860
Okay. Thank you. I have to take it easy.

562
01:09:30,860 --> 01:09:39,590
I'll try not to stress that too much. You just try and look past the rest exactly.

563
01:09:40,250 --> 01:09:43,340
Like, Oh, I just want you to. 700.

564
01:09:43,340 --> 01:10:08,959
And she said, it's like it's really. So here's the thing like 710 shows a special topic, so I can actually ask my professor about that.

565
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:17,860
She said. It's pretty intense, you realize. Two years or three.

566
01:10:23,340 --> 01:10:28,380
You know, this sounds really interesting, but it sounds like it's gonna be a lot of work.

567
01:10:28,390 --> 01:10:39,270
Isn't. This makes Beckett's class sounds more interesting.

568
01:10:42,170 --> 01:11:47,550
Till next year. Oh.

569
01:12:16,130 --> 01:12:24,260
Okay. As you said, it's not often freedom, confusion.

570
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:19,200
Okay. So it's 710 and it gives me.

571
01:13:23,150 --> 01:13:29,100
Those are the different classes. So how do you get the one thing you want to figure out what it is?

572
01:13:32,950 --> 01:14:02,970
I guess so. It's available.

573
01:14:30,010 --> 01:16:02,490
So reducing your wages from ten. Maybe.

574
01:17:06,190 --> 01:17:10,590
It was.

575
01:17:19,350 --> 01:18:43,719
Give me. Think I want you makes method's classes.

576
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:56,830
Very. Yeah.

577
01:19:01,050 --> 01:19:14,420
I'm asking because it is in control of 63997 tally that you just announced because seven time is coming up as one management.

578
01:19:33,660 --> 01:19:39,790
Because that's what they did. But on record, they just announced Tuesday morning.

579
01:19:44,140 --> 01:19:53,370
Yeah. Think. 39.

580
01:20:00,970 --> 01:20:04,100
No. Like disappeared. Yeah.

581
01:20:12,210 --> 01:20:17,050
They don't have 514. Section.

582
01:20:17,160 --> 01:20:21,350
That's like the Thursday night, one that I've signed that I'm planning on signing up for.

583
01:20:21,650 --> 01:20:29,210
It's only part of the term. It's only certain things that, you know, it's like.

584
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:39,920
Oh, nice. Either be able to take it because I.

585
01:20:41,940 --> 01:21:17,130
Don't want to take it at the other time. It's a unique situation on campus like this.

586
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:25,140
And then it didn't tell us because we compared it.

587
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:34,110
This. I did that once.

588
01:21:34,710 --> 01:22:08,620
It was too. You don't trust.

589
01:22:14,270 --> 01:22:39,830
That's when you can see through this. They get back into.

590
01:22:56,540 --> 01:23:03,890
Okay. Tonight.

591
01:23:30,370 --> 01:23:38,100
She's. Rather just things.

592
01:23:48,940 --> 01:23:52,120
Also there's actually a discussion.

593
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:04,670
All right. This was.

594
01:24:29,680 --> 01:24:36,770
So. Yeah, I do.

595
01:24:41,450 --> 01:24:44,060
You to do a lot of that.
