1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:05,930
Social Determinants of Health and
The Health Care System.

2
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:09,290
Social determinants of health
determine access to and

3
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:11,540
quality of healthcare received.

4
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:16,620
Efforts are underway to ensure that
healthcare is safe, efficient, effective,

5
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:20,110
timely, patient centered, and equitable.

6
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:23,732
Therefore, we will focus our attention
on the healthcare system for

7
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:26,780
the next few segments.

8
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:31,459
The learning objectives for the current
segment are to, identify challenges and

9
00:00:31,459 --> 00:00:35,258
issues related to the equitable
distribution of quality services

10
00:00:35,258 --> 00:00:37,490
in the health care system.

11
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:42,169
And recognize the value of collaborative
and community-based approaches and

12
00:00:42,169 --> 00:00:47,057
health disparities research and practice.

13
00:00:47,057 --> 00:00:50,445
The equital aspects of
quality of care is critical.

14
00:00:50,445 --> 00:00:55,435
Because, as noted in the unequal
treatment report, the real challenge

15
00:00:55,435 --> 00:01:00,755
lies not in debating whether disparities
exist, but in the developing and

16
00:01:00,755 --> 00:01:05,615
implementing strategies and
interventions to eliminate them.

17
00:01:05,615 --> 00:01:09,685
Therefore, our goal should be to go
beyond identifying disparities to

18
00:01:09,685 --> 00:01:11,845
determining ways to reduce or

19
00:01:11,845 --> 00:01:16,560
eliminate health inequities that
contribute to disparities in health.

20
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,380
As we consider intervening
in the health care system,

21
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:22,230
several questions must be addressed.

22
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:24,050
These include,

23
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:29,180
which social determinants will have
the greatest impact on population health?

24
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:32,250
The goal is to reach as
many patients as possible.

25
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:35,590
Which patients will benefit most?

26
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:39,374
Assessing and prioritizing when
a social determinant strategy would be

27
00:01:39,374 --> 00:01:44,285
appropriate and cost effective for
patients matters.

28
00:01:44,285 --> 00:01:47,215
Which social determinants
have the greatest appeal and

29
00:01:47,215 --> 00:01:50,200
value to community stakeholders?

30
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,790
The role of community based
interventions in contributing to

31
00:01:53,790 --> 00:02:00,120
nonmedical approaches to improving health,
is a cornerstone of this strategy.

32
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:04,240
What is the best way to collaborate
with community partners?

33
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,110
Understanding how to work
effectively with communities, and

34
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:09,820
partnership to reduce disparities,
is critical for

35
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:13,970
the successful social
determinants of health strategy.

36
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:17,362
This requires the capacity for
cultural humility,

37
00:02:17,362 --> 00:02:24,020
authenticity and willingness to
recognize strengths within communities.

38
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:27,740
How do we build multisector partnership?

39
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:31,740
Working across sectors
beyond healthcare is vital.

40
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:38,380
Consider which collaborations will be most
beneficial for facilitating social change.

41
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:42,350
Which locations within the health
care system may be most effective for

42
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:46,370
incorporating a social
determinants of health strategy?

43
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:53,470
Primary care and emergency departments
are resourceful sites to consider.

44
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:56,030
One of the biggest challenges
health professionals will face

45
00:02:56,030 --> 00:03:00,530
when working with communities
is high levels of mistrust.

46
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:05,860
Community mistrust stems from historical
experiences with a lack of concern for

47
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:09,300
community well-being by
health professionals.

48
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,520
Therefore, building trust and

49
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:16,630
working relationships with community
partners will contribute to success.

50
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:20,500
Balancing priorities for
all partners involved must be

51
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:26,570
actively pursued to ensure that
the needs of all partners are met.

52
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:31,440
Practicing cultural humility when working
with communities is vital to build trust,

53
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,050
respect, and longevity in relationships.

54
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:40,470
Working with the most vulnerable
communities requires an awareness of and

55
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:45,980
sensitivity to groups with
very limited resources.

56
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:50,820
However, there are a number of
benefits of working with communities.

57
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:56,190
These include, being able to determine
how social influences matter,

58
00:03:56,190 --> 00:04:00,280
recognizing diversity of
symptoms among patients and

59
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:07,870
identifying appropriate cultural beliefs,
values, and practices to be addressed.

60
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:12,410
If our goal is to achieve health equity,
which means

61
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:17,460
everyone has a fair and just opportunity
to be as healthy as possible.

62
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:21,620
Then reforms in the health care system
continue to be an important part

63
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:22,362
of the puzzle.
