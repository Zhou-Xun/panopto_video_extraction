00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,170
Hello. Welcome to this lecture

2
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:13,240
on statistical
hypothesis testing.

3
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,700
In this lecture, we'll focus
on the concepts of type

4
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:19,720
one and type two errors when
we make decisions from Data.

5
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:23,480
Now, in all areas of life
we have to make decisions,

6
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,640
and sometimes we make
the correct decision,

7
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,030
and sometimes we make
the wrong decision.

8
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:30,370
For instance, having sushi at

9
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:33,515
an airport cafeteria is
probably a wrong decision.

10
00:00:33,515 --> 00:00:35,560
Now, the same holds
true for making

11
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,755
decisions based upon the
data that we analyze.

12
00:00:38,755 --> 00:00:41,050
Sometimes we reach
the right conclusion,

13
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:42,790
and unfortunately sometimes we

14
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:44,865
reach the wrong conclusion.

15
00:00:44,865 --> 00:00:48,080
Therefore, our learning
objectives today are first to

16
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,450
distinguish between
what a null hypothesis

17
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:52,430
and an alternative hypothesis is.

18
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:54,530
To apply the US
criminal court system

19
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:56,150
as an analogy for what we do in

20
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:58,760
statistical hypothesis
testing to then

21
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,350
understand exactly what type

22
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:03,005
one and type two errors
are in our inference,

23
00:01:03,005 --> 00:01:03,770
and then should know

24
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:05,240
what traditionally
accepted rates are

25
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:08,315
for Type one and Type two errors.

26
00:01:08,315 --> 00:01:10,430
Now, we start with

27
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:14,195
the population and we want
to describe that population.

28
00:01:14,195 --> 00:01:16,250
As we've talked about
the population,

29
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,710
is typically described
by two parameters,

30
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:21,800
the mean of the population
represented by MU

31
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,030
and standard deviation of

32
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:25,510
the population
represented by Sigma.

33
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:27,250
As an example, suppose we have

34
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:30,160
a population that is all
6-year-old children,

35
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,605
who live in poverty
in the United States,

36
00:01:32,605 --> 00:01:35,725
MU represents the mean
number of curious teeth

37
00:01:35,725 --> 00:01:39,190
or teeth with cavities by
the time they reach age six.

38
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:42,460
Perhaps we conjecture that
on average these children

39
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:45,460
will have four cavities by
the time they're age six.

40
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:47,860
This is a hypothesis and

41
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:51,460
specifically is what we
call our null hypothesis.

42
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:55,525
The null hypothesis is the
primary hypothesis we state,

43
00:01:55,525 --> 00:01:57,580
and this hypothesis
is compared to

44
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:00,940
a contrary statement known as
the alternative hypothesis,

45
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:04,330
and the alternative hypothesis
includes every value for

46
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:05,980
the population mean that it's not

47
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:08,125
specified in the null hypothesis.

48
00:02:08,125 --> 00:02:09,560
So when our null hypothesis

49
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,480
stated that the mean
was four teeth,

50
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,145
the alternative would state

51
00:02:13,145 --> 00:02:14,650
that the mean was not four teeth,

52
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:16,145
it could be less than four

53
00:02:16,145 --> 00:02:18,365
or it could be greater than four.

54
00:02:18,365 --> 00:02:20,705
Now, for this population,

55
00:02:20,705 --> 00:02:22,460
we have a hypothesis.

56
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:24,440
We need to gather
evidence to whether we

57
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,525
think this hypothesis
might hold true.

58
00:02:26,525 --> 00:02:29,480
Therefore, we gather a
sample from the population,

59
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,330
collect data on those
individuals and we

60
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:33,920
compute the sample mean

61
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,155
x-bar and the sample standard
deviation that's sub x.

62
00:02:37,155 --> 00:02:39,680
We then use this information to

63
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,840
make inference or conclusions

64
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,820
regarding the population mean and

65
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:47,455
the hypothesis that
the mean is for.

66
00:02:47,455 --> 00:02:50,355
Now, before we go
further with the data,

67
00:02:50,355 --> 00:02:52,130
let's talk about
hypothesis testing

68
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,450
in science and how it is

69
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:55,010
analogous to how the US criminal

70
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:57,610
court system defines guilt.

71
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,595
In the US court system,

72
00:02:59,595 --> 00:03:02,060
we first are told that we
must assume the innocence of

73
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:06,365
the defendant and innocence
will be our null hypothesis.

74
00:03:06,365 --> 00:03:09,920
We then present evidence
at the trial and for

75
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,680
us our evidence is our
data, and we think that,

76
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,420
that data might
support guilt which

77
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,430
is the alternative hypothesis,

78
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,050
and we want support of

79
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:20,815
the alternative beyond
a reasonable doubt,

80
00:03:20,815 --> 00:03:22,640
and soon we will get
to the concept of

81
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,620
statistical significance which is

82
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:27,005
the strength of our conclusion.

83
00:03:27,005 --> 00:03:29,360
We then have a jury which

84
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,550
essentially would be
researchers in public health,

85
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:33,425
and from the data they make one

86
00:03:33,425 --> 00:03:35,480
of two possible decisions.

87
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,180
They either decide that
the defendant is guilty,

88
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:41,045
and so they have concluded
that the alternative is true,

89
00:03:41,045 --> 00:03:43,790
or they reached the conclusion
that the defendant is not

90
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:47,210
guilty in which case this
alternative is false.

91
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:49,445
Note that the jury never

92
00:03:49,445 --> 00:03:52,115
declares whether someone
is innocent or not.

93
00:03:52,115 --> 00:03:53,795
In other words, they never state

94
00:03:53,795 --> 00:03:55,265
that the null is true,they

95
00:03:55,265 --> 00:03:56,930
only decide whether or not

96
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:59,515
the alternative has
any truth to it.

97
00:03:59,515 --> 00:04:01,850
Now, in reality there are one

98
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:03,980
of two truths for this defendant.

99
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:07,025
If the defendant is
truly not to guilty,

100
00:04:07,025 --> 00:04:10,445
then the jury can either reach
this conclusion correctly,

101
00:04:10,445 --> 00:04:12,320
or they can make a mistake.

102
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,850
They can decide that the evidence

103
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:15,650
presented in the trial shows that

104
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:17,540
this person is
guilty and therefore

105
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:20,150
they've made a false
positive conclusion.

106
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:24,110
In this case, an innocent
person has gone to jail.

107
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:26,190
In statistical
hypothesis testing,

108
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:28,205
we call this a Type one error.

109
00:04:28,205 --> 00:04:31,070
This is the case in
which we have rejected

110
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:34,700
the null hypothesis and
we should not have.

111
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:38,455
The other case is that the
defendant is actually guilty,

112
00:04:38,455 --> 00:04:40,250
and again hopefully the jury is

113
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:41,780
able to reach the right decision,

114
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:44,015
and find that this
defendant is guilty.

115
00:04:44,015 --> 00:04:45,680
But they could also
make a mistake

116
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,510
here and decide that there wasn't

117
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:48,830
enough evidence and they

118
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,930
decided that the
defendant is not guilty.

119
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:53,300
They reach a false
negative conclusion,

120
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:56,105
and in this case a
guilty person goes free.

121
00:04:56,105 --> 00:04:58,400
This is a situation
in which they should

122
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,485
have rejected the
null hypothesis,

123
00:05:00,485 --> 00:05:02,690
but they did not.

124
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:05,345
In statistical
hypothesis testing,

125
00:05:05,345 --> 00:05:07,640
this is known as
a Type two error.

126
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,220
This is the situation in
which the null hypothesis

127
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:13,970
should have been
rejected but it was not.

128
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:17,060
So what are acceptable
rates of error

129
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:20,005
for each of these type
one and type two errors?

130
00:05:20,005 --> 00:05:23,690
Historically, we have accepted
a type one error rate

131
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,180
which we denoted by
the Greek letter

132
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:27,365
Alpha to be around 0.05.

133
00:05:27,365 --> 00:05:30,260
This level of mistakes
is small enough.

134
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:33,020
In other words, if we
have a 100 sets of

135
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:36,845
data that truly do not
support the alternative,

136
00:05:36,845 --> 00:05:39,950
unfortunately five
percent of them or five

137
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,630
will still lead investigators to

138
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:43,415
conclude the alternative is true.

139
00:05:43,415 --> 00:05:44,750
Again in this case,

140
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:48,080
we should not be rejecting
the null hypothesis,

141
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,630
but five percent of
all studies will

142
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:53,495
still make the conclusion
to reject the null.

143
00:05:53,495 --> 00:05:55,430
For a type two errors,

144
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:58,345
we set a slightly higher
level of points two

145
00:05:58,345 --> 00:06:00,080
and we denote type
two error rates

146
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,850
by the Greek letter Beta.

147
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:04,670
This means that in
every 100 sets of

148
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:08,014
data that truly do
support the alternative,

149
00:06:08,014 --> 00:06:09,800
20 of them will
unfortunately lead

150
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,995
investigators to conclude
this alternative as false.

151
00:06:12,995 --> 00:06:14,570
Again in these datasets,

152
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:17,405
we would like to reject
the null hypothesis,

153
00:06:17,405 --> 00:06:20,665
but 20 of them
unfortunately do not.

154
00:06:20,665 --> 00:06:24,240
You should note that Alpha
and Beta type one errors and

155
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,940
type two errors their rates are

156
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:28,685
never exactly equal to zero.

157
00:06:28,685 --> 00:06:30,935
So we are always potentially

158
00:06:30,935 --> 00:06:33,925
making incorrect
conclusions from our data,

159
00:06:33,925 --> 00:06:36,200
and unfortunately
we can never prove

160
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,870
anything with 100
percent certainty.

161
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:41,059
There was also a small chance

162
00:06:41,059 --> 00:06:43,775
that we're making
the wrong decision.

163
00:06:43,775 --> 00:06:45,740
This information can also be

164
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:48,490
displayed in the following
two-by-two table.

165
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:50,690
Again, we make two
decisions from our data,

166
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:54,125
we either don't reject the
null or we do reject the null,

167
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:56,240
and there are two
possible realities,

168
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,150
either the null is
true or it is false.

169
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:03,410
If the null is true and we
reject the null hypothesis,

170
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:04,820
we have made a mistake.

171
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,515
This is our type one error

172
00:07:06,515 --> 00:07:08,630
which we denote by the
Greek letter Alpha.

173
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:10,910
We call this a false positive.

174
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:14,910
On the rate if the null is
false and we don't reject it,

175
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:16,745
we've now made a type two error

176
00:07:16,745 --> 00:07:19,250
because we should have
rejected it as false.

177
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:22,340
In this case, we've made a
false negative decision.

178
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:26,650
Now, if the null is false
and we reject it correctly,

179
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:29,320
that is a good decision that has

180
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,930
probability one minus Beta.

181
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:33,520
There is a specific term for

182
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,160
this probability which we
call statistical power.

183
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,290
Is the probability
of rejecting the

184
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:41,140
null when we should be doing so.

185
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:43,810
As applied to the
example I talked

186
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:45,670
about earlier in this lecture,

187
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:48,220
where the mean number of
carriers teeth was four in the

188
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:51,475
null or something other than
four in the alternative.

189
00:07:51,475 --> 00:07:53,950
Again, if in reality the mean is

190
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:57,030
four and we reject
this null hypothesis,

191
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:58,815
we've made a type one error,

192
00:07:58,815 --> 00:08:01,960
and in contrast if the
mean was truly not

193
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,855
four and we fail to
reject the null,

194
00:08:04,855 --> 00:08:07,650
we make a type two error.

195
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:11,210
Now, all decisions
that we made from Data

196
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:14,570
certainly do have the
possibility of being correct.

197
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:16,310
But unfortunately, they also have

198
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:18,455
the possibility of being wrong,

199
00:08:18,455 --> 00:08:20,915
and we never know
for sure whether

200
00:08:20,915 --> 00:08:23,875
we have made the right
decision or not.

201
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:26,540
Now formally, we
make decisions from

202
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:29,120
our data by comparing two
pieces of information.

203
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,160
The first is the evidence or

204
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,070
a best a measure of the possible
truth and the second is

205
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:36,860
our skepticism or a measure
of how confident we are

206
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:40,175
that a new set of data would
give us a similar answer.

207
00:08:40,175 --> 00:08:41,990
The systematic way of comparing

208
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:43,460
the evidence in the skepticism

209
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,695
forms the field of
statistical inference

210
00:08:45,695 --> 00:08:47,994
that we will cover next.
