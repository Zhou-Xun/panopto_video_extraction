1
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,999
We've talked a bit about confounding now,

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,780
and we're generally talking about how confounding can occur when we're looking at an exposure to outcome relationship.

3
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:25,020
Importantly, confounding is also an issue for much of our public health surveillance data.

4
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:32,670
By far, the biggest issue that we have to worry about with respect to confounding of our surveillance data is age.

5
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:38,430
So if you think about mortality rates or cancer rates or cardiovascular rates,

6
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:44,370
all of those things are obviously going to be highly influenced by the age of the population.

7
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:52,320
Epidemiology has developed a really nice strategy that's called age standardization to account for this particular issue.

8
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:57,350
In this video, I'm going to teach you about standardization,

9
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:03,740
not only so that you can understand public health reports that are almost always reported as a standardized number,

10
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:09,140
but also because it's a very nice way to see how stratification really works.

11
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:14,570
Therefore, in this video, I'm going to go through and define standardization.

12
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:20,930
We're going to calculate age adjusted incidence rates for populations using direct standardization.

13
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:28,579
And then I'm going to tell you about how we calculate these standardized incidence ratios or standardized mortality ratios.

14
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:33,500
And same thing, just different names using a process called indirect standardization.

15
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:39,860
And finally, I'm going to help you to learn when you want to use direct versus indirect standardization.

16
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:45,860
So let's start our discussion by looking at two different populations.

17
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:51,920
Both populations share the same underlying mortality rates at every age.

18
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:57,230
That's shown here in this blue line that curves upwards with increasing age.

19
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:02,150
What's different between these two populations is their age distribution.

20
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:08,900
So on the left, I've created some artificial population, A where nobody's over the age of 45.

21
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:16,850
In population B I've created this artificial group of older adults where no one is under the age of 44.

22
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:24,130
Because of the different distribution of age between these two populations.

23
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:32,200
Even if I had identical age specific mortality rates, the population that's younger,

24
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:39,430
that's population A is going to appear to have much lower overall mortality rates than population B,

25
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:45,999
because effectively I am up weighting the very low rates that happen in young age and population

26
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,729
a an up weighting the higher mortality rates that occur in older age and population.

27
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:56,090
B. This brings us to standardization.

28
00:02:56,660 --> 00:03:01,489
The purpose of standardization is to allow the comparison of incidence rates

29
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:05,810
between groups that have different distributions of susceptible individuals.

30
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:10,120
Again, most commonly used for age, but it doesn't have to be age.

31
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:17,200
We can use it for other confounders as well. So standardization takes two different approaches.

32
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:20,800
The first is a direct approach, and the second is indirect.

33
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,200
For me, I find it really helpful to think about it in terms of the questions that they're asking.

34
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:33,070
So for direct standardization, the question that they're asking is how would the rates of disease or death

35
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:38,530
compare between two populations if only they had the same age distribution?

36
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:47,740
In indirect standardization, the question that we're asking is how do the number of deaths observed in a population compare to the

37
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:54,490
number that I would have expected if this population had the same mortality rates as another population?

38
00:03:56,350 --> 00:04:02,920
So let's go back to our two populations again. Population on the top and population B on the bottom.

39
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:12,040
What I'm assuming here is that each population has the same number of people, so there's 35,000 people in each population.

40
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:15,580
However, the age distribution is very different.

41
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:21,880
Some population, a 20 of the 35,000 people are in the young group.

42
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:29,680
In contrast, in Population B, 20,000 out of 35,000 are in the older age group.

43
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:39,790
Interestingly and importantly, you can see here for this example, the age specific mortality rates are identical between the two populations.

44
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:46,970
Using the age specific mortality rates and the number of people in each group,

45
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:53,300
we can actually estimate the number of deaths that we would expect in each of those age strata.

46
00:04:53,930 --> 00:05:00,799
Some population a multiplying the age specific mortality rate of 0.05 by 5000

47
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:06,680
is going to give us an expected number of deaths of 250 people in population.

48
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:15,380
B If I multiply that same age specific mortality rate of zero five by 20,000 people, that's occurring in that population.

49
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:19,400
What I'm going to see or expect to see is a thousand deaths.

50
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,700
This really highlights that what's happening is I'm effectively up weighting the

51
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:30,770
high mortality rates in the older population as compared to the younger population.

52
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:39,620
And therefore it's not at all surprising to see that our crude mortality rates are much lower in population A than in population B

53
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:48,290
This difference in crude mortality rates is entirely due to the fact that these two populations have different age distributions.

54
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:55,220
If they had the same distribution of people in each age group, then we could compare the groups directly.

55
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,050
This is the entire premise with direct standardization.

56
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:05,989
So with this approach, we're effectively asking how would the rates of disease or death compare

57
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:11,000
between two populations if they had the same distribution with respect to age?

58
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:12,739
Here,

59
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:23,630
what I'm showing you is a standard population that I'm taking for both of the groups I've assigned to artificially 10,000 people in each of the young,

60
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:30,140
middle and older age groups. To be honest, I could have taken a different distribution.

61
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:36,350
The only requirement is that I use the same population for each of my two groups of interest.

62
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,450
In practice, however,

63
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:47,750
it's very common for epidemiologists and public health professionals to use the distribution of ages and the full U.S. population as their standard.

64
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:58,049
So going through the exercise again now, using the counts of the standard population as opposed to the true populations we get,

65
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:03,360
are expected deaths being identical in each of the age groups because the age

66
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,610
specific mortality rate is the same and the counts are now the same as a result.

67
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:09,780
And not surprisingly,

68
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:19,980
what we see once we standardized the same age distribution is that the age adjusted rate for population A is identical to that in population B.

69
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:26,760
There was some of you who really were watching that the age specific mortality rates were the same.

70
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:33,960
We're probably thinking, could we just compare the age specific mortality rates of each group and be done with it?

71
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:43,140
Right. It's relatively easy, in my example, to see that if they had the same distribution, they were going to wind up with the same mortality rates.

72
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:50,800
The reality, however, is this was done just as an educational opportunity in the real world.

73
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:55,440
What happens is, is rarely do you have three different age groups that you're looking at.

74
00:07:56,010 --> 00:08:03,390
Typically, you would be more likely to age adjust by strata that are closer to five or ten years apart in size.

75
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:07,319
In addition, we're not just comparing two groups.

76
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:12,590
It's very common for us to be comparing across our 50 states or even here.

77
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:16,980
I have an example where we're looking at all of the different counties in the United States.

78
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:26,100
So if you think about trying to compare the age specific mortality rates of every county stratified by five year age groups,

79
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:30,060
you can quickly see that that gets quite out of hand quite quickly.

80
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:38,220
This is why we like to create these age adjusted rates for each population using direct standardization.

81
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,710
Just as a reminder, the detailed instructions for direct standardization are here.

82
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:48,500
You calculate age specific risks or rate in each population.

83
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:56,030
You then multiply those risks or rates by the number of people in each corresponding age range of your standard population.

84
00:08:56,390 --> 00:09:01,160
What this gives us is the expected number of events by age group of the standard population.

85
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:11,090
If they only had the rates of your population in step three, you sum across all of the expected number of events across all age groups.

86
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:17,600
That gets you the expected number of events in the standard population if it had the rates of your population.

87
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:27,200
And finally you divide the number of expected events by your total standard population, giving you this age adjusted rate for each population.
