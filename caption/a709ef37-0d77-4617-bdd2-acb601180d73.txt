1
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:12,285
What if I told you there was
an invisible, tasteless,

2
00:00:12,285 --> 00:00:14,460
odorless chemical to
which virtually all

3
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,340
Americans are exposed
every single day,

4
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,440
and that this particular
hazard has been

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,870
associated with things
like heart attacks,

6
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:26,280
and hypertension, and cognitive
impacts, and depression.

7
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,280
Is also been associated
with hearing loss,

8
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,440
and tinnitus or
ringing in your ears.

9
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,670
Would you believe me? Well, I

10
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:32,840
hope you do because it's true.

11
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,730
We're going to spend the
rest of this module talking

12
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:36,915
about noise or unwanted sound.

13
00:00:36,915 --> 00:00:38,990
Many of you will already
be familiar with

14
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:41,540
the auditory or hearing
impacts of noise.

15
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:42,710
So you may know that

16
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,905
too much noise exposure
will cause permanent,

17
00:00:44,905 --> 00:00:48,255
irreversible, incurable
noise-induced hearing loss.

18
00:00:48,255 --> 00:00:50,375
Now, that loss can
happen one of two ways.

19
00:00:50,375 --> 00:00:52,490
The first is if you
have chronic exposures

20
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:54,740
to relatively high
levels of noise,

21
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:57,230
this ends up causing
basically metabolic damage in

22
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:59,945
your inner ear and
subsequent hearing loss.

23
00:00:59,945 --> 00:01:01,970
But it's also possible
to get something called

24
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:04,130
acoustic trauma which
occurs as a result of

25
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:06,965
a very brief but extremely
intense exposure

26
00:01:06,965 --> 00:01:08,705
for example, to an explosion.

27
00:01:08,705 --> 00:01:09,940
In this case, we're not worried

28
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:11,430
about long-term metabolic loss,

29
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:12,460
we're worried about for

30
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:13,990
example shredding
of your eardrum,

31
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,730
or disruption of your
middle ear bones,

32
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:17,830
or damage to your inner ear.

33
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:19,120
Either way, you get it.

34
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,370
Noise-induced hearing
loss has profound social,

35
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:24,280
occupational, and
psychological impacts.

36
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,980
The prevailing theory
is that hearing loss

37
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:29,470
basically occurs
after a series of

38
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:32,275
small temporary and
reversible hearing losses

39
00:01:32,275 --> 00:01:34,915
that then add up to
a permanent damage.

40
00:01:34,915 --> 00:01:36,190
So if you imagine,

41
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:39,130
every time you do something
excessively loud,

42
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:41,395
you might suffer a
temporary hearing loss.

43
00:01:41,395 --> 00:01:42,760
If your hearing recovers,

44
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,070
but it only recovers 99.99

45
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:47,175
percent after each
one of those events,

46
00:01:47,175 --> 00:01:49,120
well if you have a number
of those events in a row,

47
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,410
you're going to slowly start to

48
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:53,495
accrue a permanent,
irreversible hearing loss.

49
00:01:53,495 --> 00:01:55,820
You can actually give
yourself a hearing test.

50
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:58,250
So if you know you're going
go do something noisy,

51
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,960
maybe going to a concert or to

52
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,390
a show and you're
riding in a car there,

53
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:04,730
when you're in the car,
turn on some talk radio

54
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:07,385
and turn it down so you
can just barely hear it.

55
00:02:07,385 --> 00:02:08,990
Now get out of the car, go do

56
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:11,420
the noisy thing and if when
you get back in the car,

57
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:13,475
you can't hear the radio anymore,

58
00:02:13,475 --> 00:02:16,250
you've had yourself a
temporary hearing loss.

59
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:17,840
I can virtually assure
you that if you

60
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,490
then spend some
time out of noise,

61
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:22,370
maybe sleeping overnight and
get back in the car later,

62
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:25,190
you will be able to
hear the radio again.

63
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:27,740
So again, most of us

64
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,300
are familiar with
hearing loss from noise,

65
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,985
but what about these
non-auditory impacts?

66
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,650
It turns out there's a whole host

67
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:35,240
of non-auditory
impacts that are now

68
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,650
pretty strongly linked to

69
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:38,930
noise in the workplace
or in the community.

70
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:41,045
These include things
like hypertension,

71
00:02:41,045 --> 00:02:42,619
ischemic heart disease,

72
00:02:42,619 --> 00:02:44,300
heart attacks for
example, Stroke,

73
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,895
sleep disturbance,
psychological effects,

74
00:02:46,895 --> 00:02:49,085
cognitive effects,
occupational injuries,

75
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:50,795
annoyance, list goes on.

76
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:53,360
There's a couple of
complimentary pathways that

77
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,820
the noise may take to cause
these health outcomes.

78
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,860
So one is, noise is annoying

79
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,960
and it's generally
stressing on your system.

80
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,090
So if you're constantly
annoyed and stressed,

81
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:03,290
that basically puts you into

82
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:04,955
the fight or flight
mode and causes

83
00:03:04,955 --> 00:03:07,280
a hormone cascade that
can lead to things

84
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,875
like high blood pressure
and heart attacks.

85
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:12,560
But we also know that if you're
trying to sleep in noise,

86
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,810
your sleep is disturbed
by that noise and

87
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:16,250
disturbed sleep can lead to all

88
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,595
of these impacts and then some.

89
00:03:18,595 --> 00:03:20,720
How do we go about assessing

90
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,660
this incredibly common exposure?

91
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,620
Well, we can do it in a
couple of different ways.

92
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:27,440
We could think about area or
activity-based measurements.

93
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,090
So you can see in the lower left

94
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:31,055
here a map of New York City,

95
00:03:31,055 --> 00:03:33,110
and this is basically
a map that's showing

96
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:35,645
different noise levels
across the city.

97
00:03:35,645 --> 00:03:37,400
For those of you who have
traveled to New York,

98
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,200
you may recognize the
flight patterns for

99
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,930
Newark and LaGuardia
and JFK airports.

100
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,620
Those are the bright red
and blue areas there.

101
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:47,720
We could also think about
making personal measurements.

102
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,420
So we might put what's called
a dosimeter on someone.

103
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,040
This device that they
can actually wear

104
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,145
around that measures the
noise next to their ear.

105
00:03:55,145 --> 00:03:56,540
Or we can take again an

106
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:57,830
activity-based
measurement where we

107
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:59,090
take a sound level meter that's

108
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:00,500
pictured in the
middle image here,

109
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,670
we go out and we measure

110
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:04,490
different types of
activities or sources.

111
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:06,250
We can also create models,

112
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,610
so we could use a combination of

113
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:09,650
measurements from a
sound level meter with

114
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,240
a map to create

115
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:14,105
a noise map like the one
you see pictured here.

116
00:04:14,105 --> 00:04:15,740
Finally, you may have an app to

117
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,345
measure noise on your smartphone.

118
00:04:17,345 --> 00:04:20,640
These apps often don't make
very accurate measurements,

119
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,850
but it's certainly a
place to start to figure

120
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:25,915
out if you have a potentially
high noise exposure.

121
00:04:25,915 --> 00:04:28,130
There are standards out there

122
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:29,660
to protect us against noise.

123
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:30,590
So in the workplace,

124
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:32,840
the Occupational Safety
and Health Administration

125
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,540
has a legally enforceable
permissible exposure limit that

126
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,700
basically says a worker
can be exposed to

127
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,530
90-A weighted decibels or

128
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:42,020
dBA on average over
an eight-hour shift.

129
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,550
That's about as loud
as standing right

130
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,500
next to a gas-powered lawn mower.

131
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,070
This is a permissible limits,

132
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,840
so this is the legally
enforceable limit.

133
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,870
But even OSHA will
acknowledge that if you're

134
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:53,320
right at this upper
end of the safe limit,

135
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,460
about one in four workers
are going to have

136
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:59,300
a substantial and serious
hearing loss after 40 years.

137
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,510
We also have exposure
recommendations for communities

138
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,755
again designed to protect

139
00:05:03,755 --> 00:05:05,615
against noise-induced
hearing loss.

140
00:05:05,615 --> 00:05:07,910
So both the Environmental
Protection Agency and

141
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:09,170
the World Health Organization

142
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:11,060
recommend a limit
not for eight hours,

143
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,575
but for 24 hours,

144
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:15,245
and that limit is a
24-hour average exposure

145
00:05:15,245 --> 00:05:17,150
of 70 dBA or less,

146
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,305
that's about as loud as

147
00:05:18,305 --> 00:05:20,555
a reasonably quiet
vacuum cleaner.

148
00:05:20,555 --> 00:05:22,295
This level is designed to protect

149
00:05:22,295 --> 00:05:25,010
anyone from getting any
hearing loss in the community,

150
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:27,910
even the most vulnerable
or susceptible individual.

151
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,390
There are other limits out there

152
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:30,710
that are designed to protect

153
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:33,875
against annoyance or
disturbed communication,

154
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,570
those tend to be much
quieter down around

155
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:37,940
35 to 55 decibels.

156
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:40,310
By comparison, a normal
conversation with someone at

157
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:43,255
arm's length is going to
be about 60 decibels.

158
00:05:43,255 --> 00:05:45,450
Let's think about
your daily life.

159
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:46,920
Where might you be
exposed to noise?

160
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,495
Well, you may have a noisy job,

161
00:05:48,495 --> 00:05:51,140
the way you get back and
forth to your job or school,

162
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:53,150
the transportation method of car,

163
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:55,790
bus, mass transit, maybe
you take an airplane.

164
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:58,010
All of those things can
add noise, and of course,

165
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:59,600
your recreational
activities going

166
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,265
to concerts or sporting events.

167
00:06:01,265 --> 00:06:04,020
All of these things are
contributing noise.

168
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:07,770
Maybe you watch TV at
home at a high volume,

169
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:09,810
maybe you listen to
music very loud,

170
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:11,120
maybe you live right next door to

171
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,580
a construction site or in
an industrial facility,

172
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,335
maybe you shoot guns
which actually is

173
00:06:15,335 --> 00:06:19,285
a relatively brief exposure
but incredibly intense.

174
00:06:19,285 --> 00:06:23,420
What does the research show
on noise in daily life?

175
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:25,955
I did a study with colleagues
at Columbia University,

176
00:06:25,955 --> 00:06:28,430
where we looked at about 4,500

177
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,825
people who lived and
worked in New York City.

178
00:06:30,825 --> 00:06:32,150
We surveyed them to figure out

179
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,530
where they were
spending their time,

180
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:35,360
and then we surveyed
them to figure out

181
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,820
where their exposure to
noise was coming from.

182
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:40,835
So on the left here, you can
see a pie chart showing that

183
00:06:40,835 --> 00:06:42,260
the average participants spend

184
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,720
about 73 percent of their
time either at home,

185
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,465
or running errands, and shopping.

186
00:06:46,465 --> 00:06:49,485
They spent about 16 percent
of their time at work,

187
00:06:49,485 --> 00:06:52,260
spent about four percent of
their time writing transit,

188
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:54,560
and only about one
percent of their time at

189
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,560
these noisy non occupational
or recreational activities,

190
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,155
and about six percent of their
time listening to music.

191
00:07:00,155 --> 00:07:02,000
On the right-hand side,
you can see where

192
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,840
they actually got
their exposure from.

193
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,095
So the shocking finding here

194
00:07:06,095 --> 00:07:09,035
was that for just about
half of our subjects,

195
00:07:09,035 --> 00:07:12,410
the primary source of
exposure for them was

196
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:14,060
not the workplace
which I was trained

197
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,935
to expect as an
industrial hygienist,

198
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:17,765
but rather listening to music.

199
00:07:17,765 --> 00:07:19,070
So the primary risk of

200
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:21,380
noise-induced hearing loss
for the average person in

201
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,090
this study was not going to

202
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:25,220
concerts or riding mass transit.

203
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:27,505
It was actually
listening to music.

204
00:07:27,505 --> 00:07:30,340
So finally, what can we do
to reduce noise exposure?

205
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:32,540
We've talked in other modules
about the hierarchy of

206
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,070
controls and we can absolutely

207
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,600
apply that to noise as well.

208
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,460
So we can think
about substituting

209
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:38,990
or eliminating a noise source,

210
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:41,495
so we can get rid of
the noise altogether.

211
00:07:41,495 --> 00:07:42,890
If we can't do that, we can think

212
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:44,210
about engineering controls

213
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:45,350
changing the source in

214
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:47,270
some way to reduce
the noise level.

215
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,620
The NASA image you see on

216
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,390
the right here
describes a couple of

217
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:51,620
different changes that are being

218
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,465
evaluated for jet engines.

219
00:07:53,465 --> 00:07:55,415
So in the 1960s and '70s,

220
00:07:55,415 --> 00:07:57,410
the American public
got quite upset about

221
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,090
all this new jet engine noise

222
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:01,715
from commercial
airliner activities,

223
00:08:01,715 --> 00:08:03,410
and the government basically

224
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:05,540
said to the airline
manufacturers,

225
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:06,740
"We don't care how you do it,

226
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:09,475
but you are going to make
jet engines quieter."

227
00:08:09,475 --> 00:08:10,940
After a lot of
complaining that they

228
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,290
were going to be put
out of business and

229
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:13,340
it was going to raise the cost of

230
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,020
airplanes too much, they did it.

231
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:17,180
So now airplanes
are substantially

232
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:20,185
quieter than they were
even in the early 1980s,

233
00:08:20,185 --> 00:08:21,770
to the point where we've now had

234
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:23,750
about a 90 percent reduction in

235
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,010
how many people are exposed to

236
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:27,725
excessive levels
of airline noise.

237
00:08:27,725 --> 00:08:29,390
If we can't do
engineering controls,

238
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:31,220
we can think about
administrative controls,

239
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,365
limiting the length of
time that we're exposed.

240
00:08:33,365 --> 00:08:34,940
Finally, last and least,

241
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:37,370
we could consider personal
protective equipment.

242
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:39,290
So this would be
wearing ear plugs or

243
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:41,435
earmuffs to reduce our exposure.

244
00:08:41,435 --> 00:08:42,920
That's not to say
these things can't be

245
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,400
effective when they're
used correctly,

246
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,240
but they do require the user
to know how to use them,

247
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,634
how to use them correctly,

248
00:08:48,634 --> 00:08:50,435
and when to use them.

249
00:08:50,435 --> 00:08:52,700
So hopefully now, you have
a better sense of this

250
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,505
very under-recognized
environmental health hazard,

251
00:08:55,505 --> 00:08:58,070
how we go about measuring
it, and most importantly,

252
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:59,210
how we can actually reduce

253
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:02,720
exposures to keep
the public healthy.
