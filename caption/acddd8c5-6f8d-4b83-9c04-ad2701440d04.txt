1
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:10,560
OK, so we're going to talk about perfectionism and to understand perfectionism, we have to understand how vulnerability and chain work.

2
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:19,770
What I'll first say about perfectionism is that some of us know that we're perfectionist and we're kind of perfectionists in recovery.

3
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,370
And then some people don't think that they're perfectionists.

4
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:31,710
But when we start looking at from day to day at the standard that you're holding yourself to and maybe how hard you are on yourself.

5
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:34,080
We're seeing perfectionist tendencies start to get in there.

6
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:40,430
So there are very few college students and professionals who don't struggle with this in some way.

7
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:47,000
So just kind of think about we you're at going through this.

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:54,180
So I'm first going to define vulnerability for you in all of this comes from Brene Brown's work.

9
00:00:54,180 --> 00:01:02,010
And we'll give you some links to where you can learn more about her, she is a Netflix special. I think that's a really good overview of her work.

10
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:12,250
But you'll get the meat of it here. So vulnerability is anything that we do in life has uncertainty, risk.

11
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:21,900
And emotional exposure. So. Most of us, when we hear the word vulnerability, it sounds kind of ew I don't want to do.

12
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:27,360
But as you read what it is, you can see how if you're gonna do anything big in life,

13
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:35,220
it's going to invoke some vulnerabilities some uncertain some risk and emotions coming up and possibly being seen by other people.

14
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:41,510
So let's look at these two myths about it. The first myth is that vulnerability is weakness.

15
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:48,780
When we actually know is that vulnerability is courage so often when we get in a high achievement setting,

16
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:53,250
we start noticing there's some uncertainty. I don't know how everything works.

17
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:57,720
I don't know if I try really hard if It's how it's going to turn out. There's some risk here.

18
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:02,500
I might make some mistakes people might have

19
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:08,460
not great things to say about me, because we do really anything, there's always somebody who has something to say.

20
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:17,330
And it's gonna be hard. I'm going to have feelings as it happens. And the fact that we know that and trying to it anyway is courage.

21
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:21,850
And so I want you to know, as you're moving through this process and future processes,

22
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:25,820
when you're feeling vulnerable, when you're feeling vulnerable

23
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:29,740
when you're about to do something or after you've done something, it doesn't mean you're off track.

24
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:34,990
Actually just part of being out here doing big and daring things.

25
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:41,160
The second myth is that I can opt out of vulnerability. And this is also untrue.

26
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:45,960
Like a lot of us, you know, we want to reduce it as much as possible.

27
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:55,140
But to be alive is to be vulnerable. To be in school, to be pursuing careers, to be in relationships that are healthy.

28
00:02:55,140 --> 00:03:05,750
All of this is really vulnerable. And so part of what we want to do is build the ability to deal with it as it comes up.

29
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:14,450
So perfectionism is really kind of the shield, the armor that we put up to try to keep us from ever being vulnerable.

30
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:20,570
But here's the thing. It's a setup because most of us know that we're not perfect.

31
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:26,030
So perfectionism is really about trying to pretend to be.

32
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:32,380
We might get 100 on a test a lot of days, but we're still gonna make mistakes here and there.

33
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:41,380
And there are gonna be days where we're not at a hundred and so we want shift from thinking about perfectionism to the pursuit of excellence.

34
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:48,440
And excellence means what was excellent for me on different days varies, it means it what I'm pushing towards,

35
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:52,370
but it also allows for me to make mistakes along the way.

36
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:58,780
And it also allows for me to address how much effort I put into things, I don't know if you've ever been in a situation where you're writing a paper

37
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:03,120
It's not even for that many point. It may not even be in a class

38
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:10,000
That matters a whole lot for your major, but you're putting a ton of time into it.

39
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,540
And one of the things that we want to learn is when is good enough, good enough?

40
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:18,180
There is plenty of things that we do that we just need good and that's all

41
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:24,840
and that's enough, because when we're trying to do everything at 120 percent, we're going to burn out.

42
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:32,580
The one of the observations that Brene Brown made in her research was that when perfectionism is driving us,

43
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:37,450
shame is riding shotgun and fear is that annoying backseat driver.

44
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:48,110
Now, I love this visual because I want you to think about yourself in your life as you're pursuing your career and doing assignments,

45
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:55,510
and when you find yourself getting really tight and it has to be just right, I want you to see, even right now,

46
00:04:55,510 --> 00:05:01,580
you can visualize what shame that voice talking to you in the passenger seat

47
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:04,670
looks like. This might seem strange, but for me at least,

48
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:10,730
it looks like in BeyoncÃ©'s Lemonade album when she has the cornrows and cleaning outside of the car.

49
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:14,720
That's who talks to me and says, you know, this isn't going to be good enough,

50
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,640
what are they gonna think? And so that's what that looks like

51
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:24,050
and then here in the backseat, all of the worries of what if I'm not been good enough?

52
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:29,870
So get really familiar with what those sound like, look like feel like when they're happening to you.

53
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:33,870
So you can pause and be like, oh, OK, wait, I see what's happening here.

54
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:44,110
You readjust breathe. And just do what I showed up here to do that I'm really capable.

55
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:54,760
Another quote from Brene. "Either you walk inside your story and own it or you stand outside your story and hustle for your worthiness."

56
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:58,870
What I like about this is that it kind of reminds us like nobody's perfect.

57
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:03,910
I like to say that we're all our unique mixture of myths and magic, though,

58
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:06,670
kind of like we talked about the values when you know what your strengths are

59
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:14,020
and you know that every set of strengths also comes with some weaknesses, like the really organized person

60
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:21,570
maybe sometimes can be kind of anxious and overdo it

61
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:23,530
at times, you know, like when you start writing paper,

62
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:32,930
they may have everything laid out and you have a lot of difficulty with the unknowns that come up with curveballs that come up.

63
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:38,370
Another person might be really flexible and creative, have a lot of difficult key with organizations.

64
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:47,770
So there's always tradeoffs and you want to know what your strengths are and what your areas for growth are and how to work with both of them.

65
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:52,480
But when we stand outside of our story, when we feel like I can only show up perfect,

66
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:57,480
it's kind of like being on a hamster wheel like you just it's it's even if you've got 100 the next day

67
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:05,800
you're right back on the hamster wheel hustling to kind of prove that you're enough as opposed to saying,

68
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:12,730
I'm like the fact that I'm even in this program. The fact that I'm in college, the fact that I'm in pursuit of this career, I am enough

69
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:19,110
I have a lot of strengths I'm just going to show up. And do my best today.

70
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:23,840
So we don't want our worthiness to just be like day to day having to prove it.

71
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:32,830
We want to actually know that we're worthy. And then show up and do the work from that piece.

72
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:34,560
Esther Perel is a therapist

73
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:42,780
she has this quote that I like, "confidence is the ability to see ourselves as flawed and still hold ourselves in high regard."

74
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:51,120
And you're probably being able to make some connections between when we talked about our self talk, and our self coaching and self compassion,

75
00:07:51,120 --> 00:08:01,470
that every single person that you think of as a hero and a high achiever and a change maker makes mistakes on a regular basis as flaws.

76
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:09,680
Some of them we know about. Some of them are hidden. But when we start to know that the commonality of everybody, including high achievers.

77
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,540
That we have flaws, so we're not feeling like oh gosh mine has been found out

78
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:21,410
I'm imperfect. But when we accept that as part of this. It doesn't mean that we're not worthy, that we don't belong here.

79
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:33,450
We tend to have less anxiety. And so we can move through it and figure out what to do in those situations.

80
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:42,090
So I also want to talk about shame, because shame is often that feeling that comes up and we're like, oh no I've just blown it.

81
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:47,790
But shame is different than guilt and let's talk about this because this is different than how people talk about it in everyday life, in everyday life

82
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:54,360
you usually talk about the two like they're kind of saying. This is this is how Brene kind of broken down.

83
00:08:54,360 --> 00:09:03,090
Shame is the intensely painful feeling or experience of believing that we are flawed and therefore unworthy of love and belonging.

84
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:09,940
And often in the professional setting, it's more that I don't deserve, never gonna meet.

85
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:16,950
So this is I am bad. The focus is on the self.

86
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:29,470
Can we often feel hot in the face, small, like we're just exposed and like we're really bad when we're feeling shame?

87
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:32,730
It's not helpful. It doesn't take us toward our goals.

88
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:43,900
And there again, anxiety, depression lots of different things, substance use, numbing can be symptoms of staying in shame alot.

89
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:54,830
Guilt, on the other hand, is a little bit like if when you're driving and there's those rumble strips on that side of the highway and

90
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:59,560
all of the sudden your car's going bump, bump, bump and to let you know that you're about to go off the road.

91
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:06,730
Or if you have a car when you're backing up or something like that goes beep beep, as you're getting close to something, guilt is this thing that let's us

92
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:10,780
know you're a little bit off track from your values and how you want to show up in the world.

93
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:14,650
It lets you know, and then you self correct, and then you get back on course.

94
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:21,310
Guilt just focus on the behavior. It goes hey, What you're doing right now isn't one of your behaviors.

95
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:28,990
You did something bad, not you are bad. And so we just direct you to get back. And so guilt, even though we usually talk about it as a negative thing,

96
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:39,200
actually kind of a emotional system, that we're off track and helps us get where we're going.

97
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:47,120
So this is an exercise that you can do kind of just to journal and think about this and how all of this works together.

98
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:56,300
A lot of is and we'll get into this more as we talk about imposter syndrome. We have a sense of how we think the world sees us.

99
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:00,660
And we have fears of how people will see us when get out here and try and do big things.

100
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:07,140
I want you to put some words to some of those fears are for you. In the orange box you're are going to complete

101
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:12,480
the sentences in the orange box. I don't want to be seen as.

102
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:22,370
I don't want people to think I am. And then you're gonna ask yourself, why are these things so unwanted?

103
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:30,840
Where did these messages come from? So, for example, if it's I don't want people to think I'm weak.

104
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:42,270
Where did you even get the message that is who you are or that it's bad to be that way sometimes?

105
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:50,890
The next box, the blue one, is I want to be perceived as. Now, I want to coach you a little bit on how to fill up this box.

106
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:56,470
This when we think about how we want to be seen. It's pretty usually perfect and impossible.

107
00:11:56,470 --> 00:12:02,320
So I think about like how Olivia Pope said to the world "I want to be seen as perfectly eloquent all the time.

108
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:08,320
Always know the right thing to say. Always be able to make the right decision. Always be perfectly organized

109
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:15,250
and together." You can fill in what it would be for you, but it's usually an avatar and an unrealistic person.

110
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:20,650
We want to get really clear on who we're holding ourselves accountable to being and how unrealistic it is.

111
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:31,860
So write it out because it's we'll start to see what you're holding yourself to that is causing a lot of stress.

112
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:40,930
The next spots at the bottom is is probably the most important part, but it requires that the first.

113
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:49,570
If somebody labels you and reduces you to that list of unwanted perceptions in the orange box,

114
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:59,060
they will be missing out on the opportunity to know that you are complex and that you have many strengths including.

115
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:03,080
So you want to have a sense of like some people are going to always critique.

116
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:09,040
Some people are going to see your mistakes and see them as all of you.

117
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:14,140
Some people are going to have unrealistic standards and you're not going to be able to meet them all.

118
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:20,170
They reduced you to just those things. It's important that you know what they're missing out.

119
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:29,120
You have a more complex understanding. And then the last one, if I label introduced

120
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:36,660
myself, to the items on this this list, the orange box, I will miss out on.

121
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:44,070
And this is important because sometimes if we get too frozen by

122
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:52,530
those ideas, then we don't pursue the things that matter to us. We may start to feel like it's too much. Fear of failure becomes too much.

123
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:56,420
And so we want to remember that we're more complex, then just the things in the orange box.

124
00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:06,750
We don't have to be perfectly the things in the blue box to show up and that we can move with all of these, that we can own all of who we are.

125
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:14,830
We don't have to be perfect to be really successful and really fulfilled in our personal and professional lives.

126
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:19,420
So take some time to fill this out. Think about how this shows up for you day to day.

127
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:24,360
And we'll keep talking about how to move forward with it.
