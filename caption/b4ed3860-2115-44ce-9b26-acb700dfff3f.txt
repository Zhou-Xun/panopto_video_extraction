Hi, Gregg. I'm wondering if I can get you to try something for your lab, two videos.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
And remember how I was trying to get you to try using Panopto recordings.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
And I have a better understanding now of where the confusion was Panopto recordings.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We typically in our in class teaching environment, we used to record the class live.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:36,000
But Panopto also allows you to store videos and there's a lot of flexibility there that might help in the long term.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So I wonder if I can get you to try for lab two.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'm in an in a practice site of mine, but if you were to go down to the Panopto recordings button for your class.

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:59,000
You're going to get this. So it looks like I have a video in here already. But if you click the create button.

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You can upload video files that you have saved on your computer.

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:16,000
So your first step would be to download those from box and then you would come to the canvas in your canvas site, Panopto recordings and click upload.

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,000
And when I click choose our video or audio files, I can select more than one.

12
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So let's. These are all Zoome downloads. So do those open and it's just going to line them up and start uploading.

13
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
OK. And then when it says upload complete, it starts processing.

14
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:46,000
But now that they're fully uploaded, I can go ahead and close this leave and let Panopto do its thing.

15
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Get them ready to play. This one that's finished.

16
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You'll notice the video is now a link. And so this is the link we could link into those lab pages.

17
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:09,000
The first thing I want to show you is if I click edit.

18
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I can come, there's a captions tab and I can import an automatic captioning.

19
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
All right. So it's gonna basically sort of read, listen to your videos, create an auto transcript.

20
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:28,000
And then if I needed to come and make edits.

21
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You know, and only if there's a really big issue, you can sort of skim over those.

22
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I can come over here to the upper right and click apply. All right.

23
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:52,000
And I can close that out. And when I click this share.

24
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:00,000
That's gonna give me the link. That I can copy.

25
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
And then kind of the way I think you were working in two tabs, I could, you know, create a new tab.

26
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Let's see where where's pages? Come too weak to edit.

27
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Lab video. Two, dash one. Highlight that.

28
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:42,000
This time, I'll use this insert link, external link.

29
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Because Panopto will not appear in my course links options, so if I go to insert link Korth links.

30
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Excuse me. So my Panopto is not an option in here because the you are well is not.

31
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You missed an instructor. It's Aspey H Panopto.

32
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
So if you want to give it a try. I appreciate it.

33
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:22,000
And then even if you get to the point where you upload all your videos and you need help linking them, then I'd be happy to help you do that.

34
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It's easy to add those captions and then make changes to the captions in case there's a glaring error.

35
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,000
And then if we ever wanted to know if there were ever a time where you wanted to kind of combine two videos into one video,

36
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
it's really easy to do in this platform.

37
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And then next year, you know, if you ever copy this site with all of these videos as almost a pre lab exercise for students,

38
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
it's gonna be so much easier. How we currently have them with the videos in the file, Varya.

39
00:04:52,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It's going to take a very long time to copy this site in the future because of how many files and the size of those video files.

40
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,265
So think about it. Let me know if you have questions.
