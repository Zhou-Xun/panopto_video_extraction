1
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:38,600
Can. Well. Hopefully that all worked.

2
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:42,010
So we're going to thank you so much.

3
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:53,899
You want to just take a couple minutes to say how or what your trajectory was for this crash resources for people who primarily are sputtering,

4
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:59,900
as you say. So, yeah, I definitely did not know that I wanted to be an AP when I was at your level.

5
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:03,020
So now so my name is Maureen Mullin.

6
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:09,140
I am a manager in the infection prevention program here at Medicine, University of Michigan Health.

7
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:11,300
Whatever we are now, you change frequently.

8
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:20,150
I, I was a microbiology major when I was here, and I have a master's in epidemiology and biostatistics from Michigan State.

9
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:23,989
I then went on to work at the Health State Health Department for about 15 years,

10
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:29,840
where I worked in environmental health, tuberculosis and health care associated infections.

11
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:38,450
So I kind of hopped around over time. And then I thought, Well, I think I want some more practical experience, so I'm going to go to a hospital.

12
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:41,569
So February of 2020, I started here at the hospital.

13
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:47,270
So it was a great time to work in a hospital, but nothing like trial by fire.

14
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:53,419
Right. I literally had my my chart training six days before everything happened.

15
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:57,260
So it was a fun year. So but it's okay.

16
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:01,400
I'm still here. It works. We made it through and. So yeah.

17
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:06,110
So if you have questions about health department things or anything like that, let me know as we go.

18
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:12,080
What's your connection with the Health Department or is do it other than other?

19
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:19,250
So I worked like I said, I started in environmental health and it's on like hazardous substance,

20
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:27,139
human health, exposure work and all of the health department jobs are basically federally funded grants.

21
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:30,290
And so your grants are for five years or for three years.

22
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:34,370
And so you can easily jump from job to job depending on whether or not your.

23
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:42,569
Research is funded or your job is funded. Every year you write for your job, you have to justify all of your objectives and everything else.

24
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:47,540
And then you find out from CDC whether or not you get your your funding and then you go from there.

25
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:56,100
So I switched to tuberculosis epidemiology, which gave me more hospital exposure, and that was really interesting.

26
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:02,160
TB is super fascinating. If you ever have a chance to work around TB, I think I would encourage it.

27
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:05,970
If you're a microbiology person in a hospital person, because it's really.

28
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:15,040
And communities like public health. I mean, there's so many different levels that for TB that really kind of put everything together for me.

29
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:18,549
And in all of that, I had more hospital exposure.

30
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:22,810
I started meeting and getting to know more infection prevention.

31
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:32,469
Is that local hospitals? And that's kind of when also when the program at the state was formed.

32
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:42,270
So I'll get into this a little bit. But in 2009, as a part of the Recovery Act, every state had to have a health care associated infection program,

33
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:47,889
and that looked different for every state. And I was not in the first group.

34
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:49,180
I was still in the TV group.

35
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:57,040
But soon after I kind of transitioned into that group because I realized it was more than just, you know, you could do more than just TV, right?

36
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,390
So you could lots of things. And then we all know Ebola hit.

37
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:07,090
And so I was part of the Special Pathogen Response Network and group funding that we got.

38
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:12,579
And so I was able to kind of provide technical assistance to all health care facilities across the state.

39
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:17,139
So I've been in every emergency room in this state to kind of look at special pathogen readiness.

40
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:23,080
So that's kind of how it ended up here and not a lot of people.

41
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:26,620
And and that's a lot saw a lot of things.

42
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,120
And it was really I mean, it's really fascinating.

43
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:34,900
So so I'm here to tell you how all the different ways that you will get to interface with the Health Department as an IP.

44
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:43,530
And just do a little bit of background for the health department because I don't think you have too much exposure to that in this program.

45
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:50,729
So now in the state of Michigan, it's the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, and they promote better health outcomes,

46
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:54,600
reduce health risks, and support stable and safe families while encouraging self-sufficiency.

47
00:04:55,170 --> 00:05:00,600
So that's a lot. And thinking about health and human services, it's not just public health, right?

48
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:04,740
Like adult aging services, communications.

49
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:10,710
Medicaid. Medicaid is huge at the state level. Behavioral health, huge at the state level.

50
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:16,170
You know, finance inspector general. And then there's this other thing called public health, which no one really.

51
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:21,240
Thinks about or remembers or wants to know about until there's an issue.

52
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:24,860
Right. Like that's the whole thing is it's it's all fine and good. Nobody knows you're there.

53
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:27,020
But then as soon as there's an issue, you're the star of the show.

54
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:32,420
So unpopular Popular Population Health Administration is this tiny little administration within this big

55
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:40,400
conglomeration of and the HHS that since I've been gone it's I think like quadrupled in size because of Komen.

56
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:48,250
So within the Population Health Administration, there's local health services,

57
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:55,870
family services, HIV, STD, STI programs, population and epidemic population.

58
00:05:55,870 --> 00:06:02,440
Health and epidemiology is chronic disease. That's kind of what the they're affectionately known as around.

59
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:09,100
And then the preparedness folks in the lab, I will say as far as infectious disease prevention,

60
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:16,000
you know, we worked most with preparedness and lab and we'll get into that a little bit more later.

61
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:27,700
So within that Bureau of Infectious Disease Prevention, there's immunizations and emerging infectious disease and also communicable disease.

62
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:33,339
And within communicable disease, there is the side section or surveillance of infectious disease epidemiology,

63
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:37,350
which is your basic communicable disease epidemiology there.

64
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:46,420
I didn't include everything on here, but there's a regional epidemiology unit, which there are eight preparedness regions in the state of Michigan.

65
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:51,280
And part of our public health preparedness is to have one epidemiologist that

66
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:56,110
covers each of those eight regions to support the local health departments.

67
00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:02,319
Local health departments are also notoriously underfunded, and not every single one has their own epidemiologist.

68
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:10,600
And I think probably until COVID, they didn't really recognize the need to have an epidemiologist all the time in these local health departments.

69
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:14,260
But COVID was covered everywhere. So it wasn't just.

70
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:22,480
Yes, actually, after this, the there was a big push to have an epidemiologist in every local hospital in early 2000.

71
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:26,020
Yep. And then, of course, the money, it went away.

72
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:31,470
And so that's kind of how these regional epidemiologists kind of came to be because yes,

73
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,780
the regional epidemiologist came to be and like early 2000 as well.

74
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:39,760
And a lot of that was the bio preparedness money also.

75
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:45,429
And then that went away. And it's a little bit of ebb and flow of funding and public health for sure.

76
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:48,640
And so it's where can you kind of layer your money?

77
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:57,430
So at some point the hepatitis HIV, TB and body art section was formed.

78
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:04,399
I know. Don't don't ask about the body art part again. Somehow we became responsible for maintaining body art licensure in the state of Michigan.

79
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,400
And because of the Bloodborne pathogen risk, we owned it.

80
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:10,940
Go figure. I don't get it. Yes, we fight.

81
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:17,470
Yeah, I took it off of this. But that's also like it was one guy and he had to perform, you know,

82
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:26,839
had to sign all the certificates and talk to all the tattoo tattoo artists and make them tattoo makeup artists and things like that.

83
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:31,970
So and then there's the surveillance for healthcare associate in Resistant Pathogen Unit or Sharpe Unit,

84
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:36,830
which is where I worked in Infection Prevention. And we'll talk a lot about the Sharpe Unit.

85
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:45,649
And as a result of COVID, the Infection Prevention Resource and Assessment Unit was created in 2020, and we'll talk a little bit more about that too.

86
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:51,530
But that is more of a resource for local health departments and long term care.

87
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:59,480
So communicable disease surveillance in Michigan, there's a communicable disease reporting law,

88
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:06,320
if you must report by Public Health Act 368, according to the communicable disease rules.

89
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:13,000
Rule revision final. It's a funny story about this.

90
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,790
You would think, oh, well, if you're the communicable disease department,

91
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:21,399
you should be able to amend that the list of diseases that you can do surveillance on.

92
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:26,500
Right. We actually didn't get that authority from the legislature until maybe ten years ago.

93
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:34,720
So in order to add COVID, candida auris cre like these things that have popped up in the last few years,

94
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:39,460
we would have to wait for the legislature to meet. We'd have to go and testify.

95
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:43,180
We'd have to go and say, oh, by the way, like, this is a thing. We need to add it.

96
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,829
And then they'd have to vote on it. And then so finally we can add it now.

97
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:53,350
And so there is a annual review and we can add things to the reportable disease list.

98
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:58,920
And also as an IP, remember that you can always talk to the health department and provide HIPA,

99
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:04,240
HIPA information so you can provide public health information to the health department when requested.

100
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:11,709
So why are we doing? Communicable disease surveillance, of course, to identify outbreaks.

101
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:17,470
We look at at clusters to assure treatment, preventative treatment and or education.

102
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:24,850
I always think of TB and this bullet. There's so many aspects of TB making sure that they're taking their treatment.

103
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:30,309
Preventing treatment. If you're LTV positive, like latent TB positive.

104
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:37,310
And you need some prophylactic treatment. Evaluate prevention and control programs.

105
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:46,429
Target prevention resources. So finding out who what areas need those, those resources,

106
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:52,310
being able to target them and provide resources at the state health health level, also at the hospital level.

107
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:58,670
I like to think of the infection prevention role kind of as the local health department of the hospital.

108
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:03,830
Right. So you do do a lot of the same functions as you would in a in a public health setting.

109
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:10,410
And to hate research. I will say at the health department level, research is.

110
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:16,810
Challenging again, funding time people in most hospitals.

111
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:21,940
That's also challenging time funding here.

112
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:26,860
Obviously, we're a giant academic medical center and we have many more resources.

113
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:30,700
But I will say effort, infection prevention like department level with at least COVID.

114
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,660
In my limited experience,

115
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:37,989
it's still kind of challenging because we still have to do our all of our regular everyday work and then try to get other things.

116
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:41,200
So we have the academic partners. So a lot of things, right?

117
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:44,710
Yeah. And traditionally infection prevention departments are staffed.

118
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:49,120
Yeah. Just so you know, if you want to go into this. So, yeah, it's like the health department, right?

119
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:52,690
Like it's very, you know, nobody knows you're there until you're needed and then you get some money.

120
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:56,260
Money, and then it kind of flows away and. Right, right. That's right.

121
00:11:56,350 --> 00:12:01,300
And if you do a good job, you can do it all because it's going to cause a problem in a way.

122
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:08,680
Exactly. And then, of course, we can't know what's going on globally without knowing what's going on locally.

123
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:13,930
So all of these surveillance efforts are really important on a chain level.

124
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:22,460
And it depends on collaboration. Health care providers report to the local health department.

125
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:27,540
Labs report to the local health department. Hospitals report to local.

126
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:32,000
Everyone can report to the local health department. But all of these places report separately.

127
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:36,200
It all kind of funnels eventually to the health department and then our data.

128
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:42,260
I wrote my health report at the Health Department. The Health Department data flows to the CDC.

129
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:46,780
So. It's kind of how that flows and them.

130
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:52,840
But who's responsible for actually doing the reporting? And do they do it?

131
00:12:52,990 --> 00:13:00,640
And that's just it. And do they do it? So I would challenge you to ask a doctor, when was the last time that they actually reported something?

132
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:05,200
Right. Like very not very many. Like they rely on infection control to report.

133
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:14,740
So at this hospital, our infection prevention department reports everything that's not reported electronically.

134
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:18,069
But again, the electronic submission is from the lab.

135
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:26,080
But we have to make sure that we're adding in any other additional required information to supplement that lab information that goes.

136
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:30,880
So you'll notice on here that hospital infection control is not actually required to report.

137
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:34,870
But we are often the proxy to the physician.

138
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,040
But hospitals are required to report. Who in the hospital is going to be doing that right?

139
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:47,500
Probably infection control. Child care facilities are not required to report necessarily single issue,

140
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:53,560
a single instances of disease, but clusters certainly are required to report.

141
00:13:55,540 --> 00:14:04,629
The other one that always struck me on this, like police, fire items they see a lot like especially in a lot, and they're not required to report.

142
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:09,170
But again, it's the communications.

143
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:17,220
All right. Chances are it usually gets there. However, health department, there's never, never sad to get multiple reports of any one thing.

144
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:20,860
They can always do duplicate it, and having more information is better than having less.

145
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:28,629
This is our communicable disease book in the state of Michigan. It provides a summary of all the communicable disease rules.

146
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:32,440
So in case you're not really wanting to read all of the whole Public Health Act

147
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:38,140
of like really wanting to bore yourself to tears in the middle of the night. If you want to go to sleep, that's something you should read.

148
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:40,990
But this is your daytime resource.

149
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:49,540
To be able it really kind of succinctly tells you which isolates need to go because there are nuances with different labs and different things.

150
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:58,390
So if you are trying to figure out what to report, how to report, this is your go to and it is available online and I provide that later.

151
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:07,629
I don't intend for you to be able to read all of these things other than to know that this is the reportable disease list of about 90 things.

152
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:17,030
This is the thing that we're allowed to amend now. The blue items are bioterrorism category agents.

153
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:28,879
Not a ton of them, but any single instance of those things like anthrax, plague, monkeypox is not actually a category aids.

154
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:33,980
And I don't think, you know, it's it's on the right hand side. It is on there, though, with smallpox.

155
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:38,680
Yes. Oh, yeah, you're right. Oh, good catch.

156
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:42,320
I didn't realize that that was a blue one. Yeah, they must have added that.

157
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:46,210
Yeah, I know Monkey Pox was on there, but I didn't realize it was a category on there.

158
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:51,770
Huh? Interesting because we don't. We don't have to.

159
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:56,750
So most of the blue ones on here, we have to submit a nice letter to the state lab for confirmatory testing.

160
00:15:56,750 --> 00:16:03,500
But I think with the monkeypox situation this year, that was the case up until the summer.

161
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:08,390
And now Mayo does a lot of our testing, too, to kind of alleviate the strain on the public health lab.

162
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:14,000
A candidate versus another candidate. This one.

163
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,260
Let's see it. It is up here.

164
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:22,890
Candidiasis. It's a right. It's a two under brucellosis.

165
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:27,310
So. Oh, under brucellosis. Two under here. So we can do the work.

166
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:31,700
Okay. There, but it's not. That's not a blue. No, it's not a bioterrorism agent.

167
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:37,490
But some you know, like I said, some must have a specimen sent to the state lab for confirmatory testing.

168
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:41,850
Others don't. Question Oh, so you said you're allowed to remove those.

169
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:45,340
So how long does it take to get out?

170
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:55,610
Good question. I know that we we would do it annually when I was there, when I was there, nothing.

171
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,549
Happened as a marginally as COVID, that we had to amend it immediately.

172
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:08,170
So I think COVID was added pretty quick. I think it was added as a novel coronavirus at first, and that was kind of how they got around it.

173
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:14,530
And then maybe I don't know when, but they can do it pretty quickly now, but they try only to do it once a year.

174
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:23,020
The book along with this list is available on that Michigan dot gov slash CD info.

175
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:29,860
I think it's a fantastic resource. I still use it all the time for reporting and what needs to be reported and how to report and all those things.

176
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:39,730
So. It also provides key info, also provides information to you if you're sitting at your desk in your life.

177
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:44,169
Hepatitis is kind of complicated. There's all kinds. It's not just like a positive or negative.

178
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:50,350
You have really Rubin levels and Altis and and how do I know if it's chronic and how do I know if it's not?

179
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:51,669
And you have all these different levels, right?

180
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:55,870
So there are algorithms to be able to help you work through that, to be able to report it appropriately.

181
00:17:56,770 --> 00:18:02,259
I think there's another like a strep pneumo algorithm like this, too.

182
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:05,290
So just different algorithms. You're not alone in reporting.

183
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:11,980
We are super fortunate here to have a team of 11 infection prevention s forwarded analysts.

184
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:16,959
So we have a lot of people and we're able to talk to each other and and use each other as resources.

185
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,190
But if you're on infection prevention, it's a lot like a smaller hospital.

186
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:27,670
You might be it and it may be you and one other person. So this information is is super helpful.

187
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:38,010
In Michigan. Michigan is a home rule state, so that means the local health departments have autonomy within their jurisdiction.

188
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:44,600
So the state health department does not actually have any authority over the local health departments similarly to CDC.

189
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:48,870
Right. Like CDC can't tell us what to do, but they can recommend what we do.

190
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:56,220
So the state usually just takes what our CDC recommends and then the state recommends to local health departments what they should do.

191
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:02,280
And the state health department operates very independently from local health jurisdictions.

192
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:11,309
When. So the role of the Communicable Disease Department at the State Health Department provide consultation.

193
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:17,490
So if you're a local health department and you need help, if you need anything, they're there to help the state there, help you.

194
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:25,590
Childhood vaccines is a big thing for the state health department supporting local health departments upon request,

195
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:28,620
especially if there is a multijurisdictional outbreak.

196
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:32,459
Think like a foodborne event like E.coli or something like that.

197
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:37,380
And there's restaurants in multiple places. The state health department is there to help you kind of coordinate that.

198
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:43,760
So you as an infection prevention list. What would not be responsible for all of that.

199
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,750
You'd be able to talk to you about the record and then the State Health Department would help coordinate all of that.

200
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:54,470
All communicable disease diseases should be reported to your local health department.

201
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:59,780
You don't report directly to the state because any investigation that needs to be done is done at the local level.

202
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:08,060
Here in Michigan, there are other states in the country where the state health department has the authority and then they have like regional.

203
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:15,000
Health departments. So Michigan has 83 counties.

204
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:23,190
We have 45 local health departments. So I just show this as you kind of get more rural, you get more.

205
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:30,190
Kind of grouping of local health departments like multiple counties department.

206
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:40,660
So we kind of talked about this already. State and local health department staff are authorized to investigate reportable diseases.

207
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:46,030
They contact health providers. They do additional case finding.

208
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:53,200
They do epidemiological studies. They do specimen collection or recommended specimen collection and.

209
00:20:56,390 --> 00:21:00,379
Everybody works collaboratively and this flow of of information.

210
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:04,580
So you might get a call from the local health department telling you to do something, and that's okay.

211
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:14,410
So like I said, it is totally okay to give any health information to someone who is calling from the local health department.

212
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:22,540
Of course, verify that they're from the local health department. But when they call it ask for to provide information that is okay or not.

213
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:28,930
You don't have to get written consent or anything like that from an individual if you are testing positive for something.

214
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:35,440
Help prevent has a right to know. And of course, it's the only information you need to know.

215
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:40,590
You don't just give them the whole record. Yeah. Questions.

216
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,230
I know. Did you consider you a public health law?

217
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:51,360
Super fascinating if you ever get a chance. Yeah, maybe.

218
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:52,370
Maybe I should have that.

219
00:21:52,370 --> 00:22:00,610
The thing, because it's really good to know something about public health law in this country, both at the national and local level.

220
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:05,560
It's yeah. And, you know, because we have a federal system,

221
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:15,890
public health was primarily a state by state thing that there are certain things that have to be CDC and stuff, but CDC has no teeth now.

222
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:22,260
So like you may have noticed during COVID that the UK seemed to be really on top of it.

223
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:25,850
Well, because they can do it now. Oh, absolutely.

224
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,100
And dramatically. Right. Right. And every single state wanted to do a test.

225
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:34,120
Had to get an emergency use thing. Mm hmm. Yep.

226
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:42,500
Yep. Yeah, this is kind of unrelated, but when you're an IP in Michigan, can you then practice IP in another state?

227
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:45,769
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, because there's no licensure. So it's just.

228
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:50,210
No, it's really helpful to know the laws of the state that you work in.

229
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:57,260
So I just think about that when you go like of health, like reporting to the health department is the same regardless.

230
00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:01,999
Like it's that's general public health law, but. Yeah, absolutely.

231
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,229
As long as you're if you're a nurse, I would caveat that.

232
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:14,990
But if your MPH, whatever IP there's a certification exam now, there's a CIC you can take and.

233
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:20,690
Yeah, but that's not even required to be in I know usually within your first two years.

234
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,380
So different surveillance systems in Michigan that you might encounter if you're an IPA.

235
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:33,830
The Michigan Disease Surveillance System is the way we report communicable diseases in Michigan.

236
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:40,150
It's an electronic system. We'll talk a little bit more about that, the Michigan syndrome, syndromic surveillance system,

237
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:45,100
and then the sentinel surveillance system for influenza like illness.

238
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:52,460
It's also one. So here is the timeline of kind of when you when do you want to know about something?

239
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:56,750
Right. So you're exposed. You're getting some symptoms.

240
00:23:56,750 --> 00:24:02,390
You're getting help from the doctor. You're getting diagnosed.

241
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:05,760
You have a lab. So this is kind of your flow, right?

242
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:11,449
Like, do you want to know about things like in a syndromic situation,

243
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:19,579
like kind of early on or the further on once you have that diagnosis into the Michigan Disease Surveillance system,

244
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:23,660
which I'll just probably start calling MDS us because that's easier.

245
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:30,360
Yeah. So MBC is a homegrown state of Michigan system that was built.

246
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:35,090
There are other other states will use different surveillance systems.

247
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:38,450
There are a few national ones that you can buy and then tailor to your state.

248
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:42,650
But we were fortunate enough to build this in the early 2000.

249
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:47,330
It's 24 seven method to report diseases.

250
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:53,360
Users are hospital level, local and state.

251
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:58,430
It's a way to facilitate electronic communication between all of those different levels.

252
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:06,680
It really is seamless as long as it's working. And we'll talk about all of that in a second about how COVID almost broke it.

253
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:12,099
And it really is. Almost real time.

254
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:18,280
So imagine back in the days of paper labs. Right. So you you get your lab drawn, you get a paper lab, and then.

255
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:24,069
Sits in a basket, probably where someone comes in and checks it and then has to like,

256
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:27,520
oh, look, there's some keep going to TV today because that's where we're at.

257
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,849
But oh, it's TV. They need to go down and call the help heart rate.

258
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:34,030
So like, that's how many steps we're now. It's like it's TV.

259
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:40,679
It just goes and everyone freaks out, so. And it reduces those delays in public health follow up.

260
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:44,010
So electronic disease surveillance is is.

261
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:48,420
Is huge. And yes, I realize we're like 20 years into it, but it's still huge.

262
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:58,560
So. The other good thing is multiple people can edit the information, edit the records, so local health department can edit it.

263
00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:03,899
It's locked like one person at a time can edit it, but everyone can see the same thing.

264
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:08,700
So you're not having to call all the time to get that information.

265
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:14,550
Every week they put out a surveillance report. So if you're ever interested in kind of what's.

266
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,450
What's going on or what was reported on within the last week.

267
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:25,350
You can go to that Michigan CD info and look for the weekly surveillance report through the wee hours by bye week.

268
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:30,800
And you can kind of see what was reported and all of our data from NBC goes to CDC.

269
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:39,330
So when you see those MMW reports with data report or data information in there, that's coming from a lot of electronic data systems.

270
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:43,770
So here's the different pathways and and biases.

271
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:48,160
Basically the community can't report in ten days. That's right.

272
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:53,320
Because you have to have a log in and you have to have some kind of level of HIPA training and that kind of thing.

273
00:26:54,100 --> 00:27:02,980
But doctors and iPads, hospital labs, everybody can enter their information into that desk, goes to the local health department.

274
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:08,410
It's auto assigned to a local health department nurse. And then they can do the follow up.

275
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:16,409
Then it flows and readjusted nearly simultaneously.

276
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:22,800
Right. Because the help the state health department can also see that. But once it's done, local health care looks like complete.

277
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:27,500
Then we know it's all set and it can. It can flow up to cities in.

278
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:35,190
Also within AMD's US, there's some pretty cool functionality built into it.

279
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:46,170
So you can see you can do some mapping of like where was the salmonella in whatever recent time frame or which one is this one?

280
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:50,250
So the bar graph is food borne disease over?

281
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:57,660
It looks like a month or so. So, again, kind of trying to figure out what was going on.

282
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,499
And you can break it down to region or county or health department.

283
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:08,399
And so it's it's really helpful to kind of. Not have to use Excel.

284
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:14,730
I heard some Excel talk in here earlier, and so you don't have to rely on your Excel functionality all of the time.

285
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:20,610
You get these cool, cool. You can also export the data and do whatever you need to do in Excel.

286
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:34,330
But. The stuff is here. Okay, so here's where COVID almost broke us, so and allows us and 2007, we were getting about 84,000 referrals the whole year.

287
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:38,990
Or 77, some 8000 individual case reports.

288
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:43,940
Right. 400,000 transactions or transactions every time someone logged in and changed something.

289
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:49,610
So you can see like even from 2007 to 2016, in that ten year period, it really exploded.

290
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:54,590
A lot of that has to do with electronic lab reporting because labs could auto report.

291
00:28:54,590 --> 00:29:07,070
And so there were a lot more transit transactions. Every every single positive chlamydia was a now a transaction and every single just lots more.

292
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:10,370
So in that ten years, we were able to build and add hospital systems.

293
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:14,730
And so that was that was great. So that was 2016. COVID.

294
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:21,620
So you'll see in January of 2020, there were 22,000 transactions in a day.

295
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:25,030
That was when a crown hit. So like.

296
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:33,770
That's that's I mean, it really and this was not built to withstand that flow of information in that amount of time.

297
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:41,290
So luckily, they were able to secure funding early on in the pandemic to be able to build your infrastructure, to maintain this type of thing.

298
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:47,000
But again, you know. Think about building that infrastructure until there's a problem.

299
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:56,890
So. Luckily we're still kind of low, but we're all kind of bracing for what might happen in the few next few months pre-virus season.

300
00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:06,130
So that's something that's probably the biggest thing that you would use next to are just kind of pretty cool surveillance systems.

301
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:14,470
This is the syndromic surveillance system. It's an emergency department surveillance system that detects and tracks chief complaints.

302
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:24,100
So are chief complaints of when people come into the ED, they are categorized according to symptom.

303
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:32,110
And again, it's a web based application. And when so they use they set alerts and thresholds.

304
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:39,909
And so when something goes over that alert, the regional epidemiologists will get an email or a ping saying, go check this out.

305
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:53,160
This could be a thing. So each message like there's no I these messages while there is some but not no name or it's very small it's

306
00:30:53,730 --> 00:31:01,410
date of birth sex home zip code so home zip codes important to remember date time and your chief complaint.

307
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:10,200
So very minimal information. And then your chief complaints are kind of lumped into these syndromes on the side.

308
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:13,110
So like slurred speech can be bottlenecked.

309
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:23,310
General weakness is just a constitutional stomach pain, vomiting, things like that, or gi difficulty breathing as respiratory and so on.

310
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:25,830
I think they've added heat now too, which is interesting.

311
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:39,870
So back in the fall of 2016, I think over Labor Day weekend, we started getting calls from hospitals saying,

312
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:45,660
have you seen and this is when I was at the health department, have you seen a lot of respiratory illness?

313
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:51,360
Because we think we're seeing a lot. And in fact, we were and I don't think I have I don't have that here.

314
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:54,719
But it was the start of Enterovirus D68.

315
00:31:54,720 --> 00:32:02,820
And I don't know if you remember that when all the kids were getting sick and there was paralysis associated because of the polio like virus.

316
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:09,030
It was really scary, but it was really cool to be able to, from a data standpoint,

317
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:16,920
to be able to look at the data because there were so many kids coming in and you could see that syndromic surveillance just like the peak was amazing.

318
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,870
So it works. But we knew there was a problem and that we had to do something about it.

319
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:29,010
But like I said, an email alert is sent to state and regional epidemiologist if that threshold is detected.

320
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:38,260
When when else do we use this? When we hosted the Super Bowl World Series, you know, big events,

321
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:43,850
they turn on syndromic surveillance to kind of make sure that people aren't randomly showing up at.

322
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:50,330
Local hospitals with something. They also use it for seasonal influenza monitoring.

323
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:57,540
I kind of like I just mentioned and then such a awareness, situational awareness to see, you know, something could be going on.

324
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:07,070
So one case of flu is not reportable, right? We know that like if you have one case of flu not reportable, but groups of foot flu is reportable.

325
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:11,719
So but, you know, we still always like to talk about you always see in the news,

326
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:16,040
like so many cases of flu reported or so, many people are showing up sick.

327
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,320
How do they get this information?

328
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:26,060
So there is a Eli surveillance sentinel provider program and not all hospitals are part of it, but your hospital, if your IP could be part of it.

329
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:30,080
And so you find when and where flu activity is happening and you track illness.

330
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:34,760
And it's usually while outpatient offices are reporting.

331
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:39,870
This flew surveillance through. I'm trying to remember how we do this now.

332
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:45,000
I think it's through an Excel sheet on a weekly basis. Unless you have some other way to set it up.

333
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:49,110
But they are very flexible, knowing that some outpatient providers may not have.

334
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:54,420
A standard electronic lab provider who could you know, who could submit.

335
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:56,579
So there's different ways that you can do it.

336
00:33:56,580 --> 00:34:04,350
But if you are working as an IP in an outpatient place, your health department might say, hey, can you you let us know about this information?

337
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:10,470
pre-COVID, it was usually October to April,

338
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:15,989
but we kept it going all summer this year because the idea was just kind of all over the place all the time.

339
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:22,890
So we'll see what happens next year. And then there's the hospital network.

340
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:27,390
So the influence of Sentinel Hospital Network are hospitals that agree to participate.

341
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:35,060
And it's a weekly report consisting of influenza associated hospitalizations in five age categories.

342
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:41,559
So again, this is that data that you'll see in the news that, you know, there's an increase in middle age, people getting flu.

343
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:52,129
So this is kind of where that comes from. I will say before I leave flew that the one thing about the one flu situation that is

344
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:56,000
reportable is pediatric influenza death that is on the reportable disease less so.

345
00:34:57,260 --> 00:35:02,150
So I don't. All right. Questions about surveillance systems before we go into the sharp unit and h-ii stuff.

346
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:09,340
Yes. So we do this for just the record.

347
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:15,680
Mm hmm. And we happen to know what you might have to do.

348
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:19,730
For some reason, you were for every single one. I'm fairly certain.

349
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:28,270
And this is not the first time I've heard this. I don't know.

350
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,650
I don't remember. We should have. Yeah. You should ask. I mean, ask why?

351
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:35,320
And some places just say it's just easier to than not.

352
00:35:37,090 --> 00:35:43,300
There might be something with campus after last year's campus situation that they just want to know.

353
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:48,010
Offloo. That could be just a leftover, but I don't know.

354
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:58,150
Good question, though. Okay. So the sharp unit, which I talked about before, it had programs and states were nonexistent prior to 2009.

355
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:08,190
So in 2009, everyone was like, well, what, what does the health department have to do with hospital associated infections?

356
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:15,450
That was kind of like the big question that everybody was asking. So we had to sit down and come up with objectives and things.

357
00:36:15,450 --> 00:36:23,009
And why, why? Why do we need to be a part of the health department? So we were able to help coordinate surveillance and prevention in Michigan.

358
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:30,620
So again, not just what is my hospital doing, but what are our hospitals doing and can we make a network?

359
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:36,990
Can we make best practices? Can we help each other? Because not every hospital has a lot of infection prevention,

360
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:45,300
us improved surveillance and detection of antimicrobial resistance pathogens that has exploded in the last 10 to 15 years.

361
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:48,480
Identify and respond to disease outbreaks.

362
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:54,540
One thing I forgot to mention about reportable diseases is that while one case of something might not be reported,

363
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:59,100
if you ever suspect an outbreak of something unusual occurrence that is reportable.

364
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:06,900
So even if the specific pathogen is not on a reportable disease list, if you notice an odd cluster of something that would be reportable.

365
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:11,200
So keep that in the back of your mind.

366
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:17,129
And then, you know, educate health care providers, state, local, public health partners about HIV AIDS.

367
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:20,130
Like I before this, I didn't know what a lab was like.

368
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:27,600
I wasn't epidemiologist to say health department, but I knew what it was. But now I think it's more more common.

369
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:34,150
So the short unit does outbreak response surveillance and reporting and consulting and education and containment response.

370
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:41,510
So. Kind of raw things that you wouldn't normally think about when you think about like public health, communicable diseases of you.

371
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:45,800
Outbreak response.

372
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:58,460
A lot of times we would get a call from health or from a hospital that says, you know, we have a weird group of mercy cases in our neonates.

373
00:37:58,940 --> 00:37:59,690
Can you help us?

374
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:14,100
And so we could potentially help with some genotyping of the mersa of Mersa isolates to identify genetic relatedness versus a really bad example here.

375
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:22,370
So like with Serratia or something else because more so it's kind of everywhere now, but as an estimate vector.

376
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:32,120
But the state health department could help coordinate if you didn't have web capability at your hospital to be able to do genetic related testing.

377
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:37,160
Many hospitals don't have that at their hospital labs. Of course we do.

378
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:48,229
I give this lecture and we like really, this hospital is very well set up to be able to handle most of most of what I'm saying.

379
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:55,610
That the hospital help him provide. Yeah. And I think that's important now that doing genomic sequencing there rather than pulsed field.

380
00:38:55,910 --> 00:39:09,569
Yep. Yeah. That's a lovely job. So recent outbreaks that were that maybe not so reason anymore but investigated by the unit one that

381
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:13,980
I worked on was medical tourism associated with plastic plastic surgery in the Dominican Republic.

382
00:39:14,370 --> 00:39:26,339
So again, we started hearing about people coming back from the Dominican Republic who were having some pretty nasty NTM infections like SSI,

383
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:29,190
like surgical site infections. So.

384
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:39,520
The CDC will put out something called an EPI acts and they will they will say, hey, anybody that has a weird entity and they have traveled.

385
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:48,350
Should consider looking into this. And lo and behold, we did have a case here in Michigan who she she was actually a nurse who went to the

386
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:54,020
Dominican Republic because it was cheap and she could have a spa stay while she was there.

387
00:39:54,020 --> 00:40:01,099
And she was able to be there for three weeks. And she got all of the things tucked in and tucked and lifted and she was feeling great.

388
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:03,649
And then she came back and had a really,

389
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:11,940
really horrible infection and had to have everything removed and was on I.V. antibiotics for months like it was.

390
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:19,250
But. That one single case of NTM would not be reportable otherwise.

391
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:23,410
Right. So it's things like that that the staff, you know, would investigate.

392
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:29,200
Mycobacterium Sonia with tattoos. So that was infected ink.

393
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:36,340
So people were going to just get their tattoos and then it would get really disgusting and gross and they would call their provider and be like,

394
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:39,490
this thing I have is is kind of like, not right.

395
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:47,920
And then we would get pictures and we were able to work with other state health departments to be able to figure out that it was, I think.

396
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:56,030
Other fun ones. Yeah.

397
00:40:56,030 --> 00:41:04,340
I'm trying to think of other fun ones on here that. Pseudomonas infections with contaminated t gel.

398
00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:07,520
So that was an interesting one to me.

399
00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:15,870
You don't usually think of pseudomonas with water and we were trying to figure out.

400
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:20,910
So it is like the probe that goes down your throat and in and we were like, well,

401
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:26,849
what water we were asking and they figured out it was the gel that was contaminated.

402
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:32,090
And for whatever reason this particular hospital had more gel and maybe more susceptible patients.

403
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:36,060
I don't know. But that hospital figured it out. But it was a nationwide recall.

404
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:43,469
But how does it happen at one hospital? So, again, it takes just, you know, an astute clinician and astute infection prevention is to say,

405
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:47,060
like, why do we have all of these infections and are they related?

406
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:52,830
So that is kind of your your job to kind of review these even those non reportable things to think like,

407
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:56,010
do we have a situation going on or is that just kind of background noise happening?

408
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:04,180
Other ones on here. Oh, the fingernail one is a little bit gross.

409
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:13,840
Pseudomonas with an infected fingernail we had and again, this was an astute clinician who was putting in pacemakers and he called and he's like.

410
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:18,630
I think I'm infecting my patients.

411
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:23,330
And you're like, What do you mean? So he had had an investigative fingernail.

412
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:26,960
He had gone to the dermatologist. They had treated him.

413
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:30,590
They had cleared him. They told him he could work. They told him he had it removed like that.

414
00:42:31,010 --> 00:42:35,090
It was okay. They still had the fingernail or hit. I don't remember all of the details now, but.

415
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:41,809
They cultured the patient, they cultured the fingernail.

416
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:45,390
And it was him. He was using gloves appropriately and everything. It was glove failure.

417
00:42:45,410 --> 00:42:48,900
There was it could get through the gloves. So you never know.

418
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:53,580
He felt terrible. He took himself out of practice for a long time after that.

419
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:58,510
It was nice. You recognized it. Yeah. I mean, really, he.

420
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:05,169
He could have not said anything. He could have not, you know, he really just could have said didn't have to call us, did anybody?

421
00:43:05,170 --> 00:43:10,809
But he was feeling like because he was treated and he was cleared to continue practicing.

422
00:43:10,810 --> 00:43:17,960
But it was just that gross fingernail. Health care associated, hep C related or doctor version.

423
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:23,750
You guys might remember this as more than ten years ago or so.

424
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:27,379
So there was an individual named David.

425
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:35,600
I can use his name because he's in jail. And it was in the news who was C.T. TAC radiology radiologist who traveled around.

426
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:42,890
He worked in different parts of the country. I think he was eventually captured in New Hampshire.

427
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:48,080
I remember this case. And he had hep C, but he was a drug diverter.

428
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:51,530
And, oh, doctor.

429
00:43:51,530 --> 00:43:55,579
So he was setting people up for their seats and giving them pain medicine.

430
00:43:55,580 --> 00:44:00,860
But he wasn't giving them pain medicine. He was giving it to himself and giving him or giving him some and giving them the rest.

431
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:03,950
And it was like those two a little bit from it.

432
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:09,190
Yeah. Inject themselves and then just contaminate the the pain medication.

433
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:14,930
Correct. Very non-sterile technique, if you will, with these vials.

434
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:21,469
Right. Because, you know, if it's just. Yeah, it's just it's sharing needles.

435
00:44:21,470 --> 00:44:24,650
It's sharing vials.

436
00:44:24,650 --> 00:44:28,610
It sharing containers. It's sharing whatever you can get your hands on.

437
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:34,250
And this individual, he worked in eight states, something like that.

438
00:44:35,330 --> 00:44:36,979
And Michigan was one of them.

439
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:43,190
And we got a call at the state health department that said we have this individual and they they couldn't tell when he became hepatitis C positive.

440
00:44:43,190 --> 00:44:46,950
So. Nobody knew other than right now he had hepatitis.

441
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:51,800
So how do you know when in order to just out of an abundance of caution.

442
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:56,000
Right. Everybody deserves to know that he may have been exposed because. Hello.

443
00:44:56,010 --> 00:45:04,680
So they went back his entire career and we had to work with every public information officer at every hospital that he worked at.

444
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:10,890
I think there were three or four in Michigan, some of which were very large institutions and yet, you know,

445
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:15,659
carefully crafted messaging and give them actionable items of, you know,

446
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:20,010
you may have been exposed to have Tennessee in could have been eight years ago.

447
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:27,709
Please follow up with your health care provider and get some bloodborne pathogen testing at no cost, and that's trying to set up all of that.

448
00:45:27,710 --> 00:45:31,940
So as an infection prevention, as you may very well may get a call from State Department that says.

449
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:36,670
Help us with this. Get your get your employer patient list and all that stuff.

450
00:45:36,670 --> 00:45:42,100
So. Yeah. The nice thing about hepatitis C is there's an effective treatment now.

451
00:45:42,130 --> 00:45:45,459
Now? Mm hmm. Yeah. So horrible.

452
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:49,900
But at least there's something you can do about it. It's a cause of liver failure.

453
00:45:50,470 --> 00:45:54,310
Mm hmm. And then you're not eligible for a transplant, and so it's real.

454
00:45:54,640 --> 00:46:01,660
It's really bad. Yeah. And I think the last one on this list that I'll talk about is the mycobacterium chimera associated with heater cooler devices.

455
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:09,190
So this was and again, I don't know if you guys know about Mycobacterium tuberculosis, it grows really slow.

456
00:46:09,730 --> 00:46:13,390
So associating it with an event can be really challenging.

457
00:46:15,310 --> 00:46:19,120
So heater cooler device is something that's used during cardio bypass.

458
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:22,210
So, yeah, this was a nightmare.

459
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:26,710
I was a coordinating person. I was. Yeah. Yeah, I was the person who coordinated all that.

460
00:46:26,930 --> 00:46:31,650
Yeah, it was a disaster. Long story short.

461
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:36,970
The. Maker of the bypass machine.

462
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:43,650
It was basically contaminated at manufacture. And so there's water in it.

463
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:49,380
That can aerosolize when it's near the patient during surgery.

464
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:55,590
So you have to think like think about this, right? Like, your patient's open.

465
00:46:55,590 --> 00:47:03,480
But there's this thing over here that might be aerosolized or something, but then somehow gets into the patient while their chest is open.

466
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:10,200
You finish everything up, you sell them up, everything's great. And then four years later, they have this infection.

467
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:14,280
And it's a weird one and it's a really solid like this is what we were dealing with.

468
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:17,540
And so we had to again talk to everyone.

469
00:47:17,550 --> 00:47:19,950
And I think this was associated with heart transplant.

470
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:27,690
So there were are lung transplants, so it was less hospitals because not every hospital will do that type of procedure.

471
00:47:28,830 --> 00:47:32,190
But again, we had to go back to the hospitals and say, hey, you do these procedures.

472
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:36,920
Have you seen any of these infections? And if yes, let's talk.

473
00:47:36,930 --> 00:47:40,079
And so it was very it was challenging.

474
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:43,260
And we did have four or five cases in the state of Michigan.

475
00:47:43,830 --> 00:47:47,280
I mean, you can read a lot of this outbreak.

476
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:53,669
Yeah, really fascinating. And just talk about disease detective work, if you like.

477
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:57,990
The detective story really is a disease detective work.

478
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:04,410
And it also says something about how surveillance is so important because you can't find rare events.

479
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:09,089
No. Yeah. If you don't have surveillance. I mean, this was really a very rare event.

480
00:48:09,090 --> 00:48:19,740
But again, I think it was first spotted by an astute, astute, but someone who recognized patterns and was paying attention.

481
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:24,450
But nonetheless, it is really it's fun.

482
00:48:24,750 --> 00:48:31,320
It really it's a wild thing, right. Because you you have to like what was that particular heater cooler by device,

483
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:36,760
more infected and cause, you know, like maybe two or three patients from that area.

484
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:40,080
Like, who knows? Like it's it's just really interesting how it all came about.

485
00:48:40,290 --> 00:48:43,649
So, and then all what they had to do with do stuff about it. Yeah, yeah.

486
00:48:43,650 --> 00:48:47,520
Because you had to sequester them, you had to test them and then you had to find a another provider.

487
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:53,190
And then because you don't want to stop doing those procedures, right? Because those are like lifesaving procedures that aren't done very many places.

488
00:48:53,190 --> 00:48:55,860
So it was a very interesting time.

489
00:48:57,300 --> 00:49:07,110
So all of this to say the program that the state does do a lot of weird things that is outside of the normal like disease surveillance.

490
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:12,030
And the other thing you can say is the sure this funded the first round trip internship.

491
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:21,060
We sure did. So if those of you who had internships, you can thank the show because because they had that money from bioterrorism,

492
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:28,550
they had money that they said they would through infection control. So our very first year we were able to fund internships.

493
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:33,150
So yeah, yeah, we had a lot of chip interns at the state.

494
00:49:34,890 --> 00:49:38,250
A couple of caveats for surveillance and reporting.

495
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:43,770
So on that referral disease list, vancomycin,

496
00:49:43,770 --> 00:49:50,760
intermediate staph aureus and think myosin resistant staph aureus used to be the only guys that were on the reportable disease list.

497
00:49:51,630 --> 00:49:54,990
Since then we've added carbapenem producing.

498
00:49:56,700 --> 00:50:00,600
Carbapenem resistant Enterobacteriaceae and Candida Auris.

499
00:50:02,130 --> 00:50:06,360
And then, like I said, unusual occurrences, clusters, things like that are reportable.

500
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:11,280
But an individual like Clancy, according to one surgical site,

501
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:19,259
infection is not affordable to the state because only 33 states have laws that require some state.

502
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:26,670
Like if you work in a state like I know Missouri has really strict HHI reporting laws, like you have to report all that stuff to the state.

503
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:32,670
I don't know what they do with it, but they do.

504
00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:41,669
So check out your states and see who has a report. And not like some of these green states, it's not every single HDI is reportable,

505
00:50:41,670 --> 00:50:44,700
but like a group of them, or maybe just SS eyes or something like that.

506
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:49,200
But there is some level of mandatory reporting to the state health department.

507
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:54,870
Michigan, not so much. But hospitals can voluntarily report to.

508
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:00,920
The State Health Department. So do you guys know what NHS is? And some of you do.

509
00:51:01,660 --> 00:51:06,050
Okay, so that's how all of us data is collected, right?

510
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:16,919
So at the state we have a group user of at four on HSN where hospitals can voluntarily enroll and share their data with the state so that we can kind

511
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:25,290
of get a better picture at the state level in more real time than kind of what's going on at CDC to see what's going on to high levels in Michigan.

512
00:51:26,790 --> 00:51:36,240
So, you know what think is that is. The data that end up at the state level in this group use are not like.

513
00:51:37,250 --> 00:51:44,540
Norine had an SSRI on this day. It's just like, you know, SSI from March in a half or something like that.

514
00:51:45,230 --> 00:51:51,770
But we're able to produce like statewide data. So this is the different types of information that we collect at the state.

515
00:51:53,930 --> 00:51:58,880
SSI Clancy, VA Cody, S.D., iLab ID and Mersal Lab ID.

516
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:05,540
So those are the different ones that we don't do, like pace or what other dialysis things like out of the state get.

517
00:52:07,650 --> 00:52:14,100
So sharp reports are posted quarterly. In a de-identified manner.

518
00:52:14,670 --> 00:52:18,030
Individual hospital data was never shared publicly.

519
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:22,380
And every every hospital that shares data, I think when I left, we had.

520
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:27,200
More like like 80% of the hospitals in the state shared data with us.

521
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:33,559
So it was really a nice collaborative. There's no mandating anything, but people knew that it was a good thing to do to share your data,

522
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:38,930
to be able to speak to and tackle and be able to prevent it as.

523
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:43,510
But every hospital will get a letter. And then when we put let's put it out.

524
00:52:43,870 --> 00:52:50,320
You can follow your letter along the report. So this is covered your data.

525
00:52:50,330 --> 00:52:56,090
I just left this inheritance to kind of look. To see what? Cold dead to our.

526
00:52:56,240 --> 00:53:00,890
Did you see the state already on the state level and they haven't seen it so.

527
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:08,229
For Katie. And so the percent the greens on rather percent change from the year prior over

528
00:53:08,230 --> 00:53:18,280
the quarter so quarter for all locations had 40% worse catheter associated UTIs.

529
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:24,080
ICOs were 60%. So just think about 2020, where we were, what we were doing.

530
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:30,520
Clap the. And he's still kind of a hot mess.

531
00:53:31,390 --> 00:53:37,840
Just to be completely honest. It's really sad because questions are going, Oh my gosh, we were doing so well before the pandemic.

532
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:42,979
And now we're like. Back to where we were. And it's and people are tired.

533
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:49,730
And how do you engage tired health care workers to go back to basics and it's it's challenging but it's.

534
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:58,989
It's interesting how we're kind of getting back to this work and we're kind of trying to make COVID into normal, normal, everyday work.

535
00:53:58,990 --> 00:54:12,790
But my question now is, and this is data for 2020, have you seen here year or so, 2022 data isn't out yet.

536
00:54:12,790 --> 00:54:16,530
So and it is some data is always a quarter behind.

537
00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:20,980
So November 15th we don't the reporting quarter.

538
00:54:22,330 --> 00:54:26,980
To Data select, it's always really far behind. So 2021, I haven't seen this data yet.

539
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:34,480
I would guess it didn't get to much better. But in question, I just don't I don't have the data on it.

540
00:54:35,830 --> 00:54:37,300
It was a bad surprise, too.

541
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:47,380
Yeah, I meant it because I had some chip into the data and like we had the hypothesis, perhaps because everybody was being more careful.

542
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:51,630
During the pandemic that has would go down.

543
00:54:52,940 --> 00:54:56,690
And no, it's no. And it's across the board.

544
00:54:56,690 --> 00:55:02,710
It's not just one patient. No. Right. And in COVID patients, they had more lines and stuff.

545
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:06,560
You would think, well, that would be okay, but across the board.

546
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:14,810
So, yeah, I think it was really a hospital strange situation that, you know, that's really a.

547
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:20,660
But we are slowly digging her way out for sure. Yeah.

548
00:55:21,410 --> 00:55:25,070
I can't explain the increase in the ward and locations.

549
00:55:25,730 --> 00:55:28,750
Green from the bottom of this. So I don't I don't know. I can't explain it.

550
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:35,510
I don't know what that means. It's kind of all locations, but it doesn't make sense to me.

551
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:39,020
So I like the state of came from the state, but it doesn't compute.

552
00:55:39,020 --> 00:55:42,200
Like. Why would it be? I don't know.

553
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:51,880
Anyway, so. But I mean, again, then we would expect ventilators to be worse, right, because of the COVID situation in 2020.

554
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:56,230
But it was everywhere. It wasn't just not just ICU patients.

555
00:55:56,230 --> 00:56:02,890
It was all the patients. One thing that did get better was CTF though i.

556
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:08,559
We're washing your hands more. No, we weren't. I can tell you that because I know hand hygiene program.

557
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:11,950
We thought we we paused it for a long time. I think you guys already talked about this.

558
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:17,650
We paused hand hygiene, and then we started it up again and we were like, Oh, maybe it'll be still 95, 95%.

559
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:22,190
Nobody was washing their hands. Ms. bacteremia.

560
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:28,310
We're still trying to come out of this to. I think this is a function of washing hands, too.

561
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:31,820
And really the five moments of hand hygiene, you know, I think.

562
00:56:33,450 --> 00:56:38,660
We forget it before and after glove use before and after touching patients, touching things.

563
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:44,610
We're going in and out because that's what that's what we measure. But all the other parts are.

564
00:56:45,910 --> 00:56:49,630
Our struggle loss on the SSI was kind of.

565
00:56:51,110 --> 00:57:00,920
Over the place. But like thinking about this, you know, our surgeries were down, the volumes were down, patients were sicker.

566
00:57:01,530 --> 00:57:06,530
And, um, but maybe those that were getting, like, so capable, broke hips and knees.

567
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:12,650
Hips were worse, but knees were better. But were the patients who were getting knees maybe healthier?

568
00:57:12,670 --> 00:57:15,930
I don't know. And it's hard to. Hard to say on either.

569
00:57:19,130 --> 00:57:23,110
Device utilization. It's quarter one was great.

570
00:57:23,770 --> 00:57:33,960
Quarter one was no go though. So. And again, that utilization rate in quarter three for ventilators is interesting, too.

571
00:57:34,650 --> 00:57:39,000
Yeah. Now, we don't usually use that much. We know what we're doing.

572
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:53,360
Yeah. I think. So there is something that came out in 2021, basically saying what we just said about is.

573
00:57:55,820 --> 00:57:59,930
Clancy ACR experienced the greatest increase among all age types.

574
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:07,180
And then the decreases in CTF increased focus on hand hygiene.

575
00:58:08,170 --> 00:58:11,960
Maybe, but continued inpatient antimicrobial stewardship programs.

576
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:15,910
Maybe there was a lot of focus on medication management, I think during COVID,

577
00:58:16,540 --> 00:58:24,040
maybe there was something there, and that marked a decline in outpatient and antibiotic prescribing.

578
00:58:24,730 --> 00:58:31,150
So that helps a lot. I don't think people were getting sinus infections and ear infections and things like they were prior.

579
00:58:31,570 --> 00:58:34,750
During COVID, you were either with COVID or without.

580
00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:38,530
We didn't have a lot of the other like background stuff happening that I am

581
00:58:38,530 --> 00:58:42,129
interested to see what will happen like with the current like right now data.

582
00:58:42,130 --> 00:58:45,340
But we'll see because like that. It'll be.

583
00:58:46,310 --> 00:58:55,910
That again. But. Candida Auris So again, this is one of those we have time for this like reportable diseases.

584
00:58:55,910 --> 00:59:03,500
That was not a thing when I started in the staff unit. So that makes me feel oddly old, but not because that was a big thing.

585
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:11,580
But we didn't even really know about it. So it kind of just popped out of nowhere.

586
00:59:12,180 --> 00:59:20,430
It's a highly drug resistant yeast. A lot of that at the time and a lot of lab instruments could not pick it up.

587
00:59:21,450 --> 00:59:29,580
It can cause serious and invasive infections. Difficult to identify, but it loves to hang out on surfaces.

588
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:35,180
And it's kind of hardy. So these are CDC maps and they're not always.

589
00:59:36,850 --> 00:59:40,959
The same. So I'm going to make sure that we're talking about the colors here.

590
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:47,080
But. We had some of it, and even in 2013 it was like maybe one case.

591
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:54,580
So this is over three years. We knew like Chicago area, long term acute care in New York and New Jersey.

592
00:59:54,580 --> 01:00:00,309
Like that's what we kind of focused on. We were like, Oh, okay, these places. Yeah, well, okay, 2018, they're ready now.

593
01:00:00,310 --> 01:00:04,740
But look, that's popping up elsewhere. 20, 20, 2020.

594
01:00:04,810 --> 01:00:07,840
Right before I left the state, we were like, Oh my gosh, it's everywhere around us.

595
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:12,579
It's in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois. Like, when when is someone just going to come into Michigan and bring it right?

596
01:00:12,580 --> 01:00:15,819
Like you're just waiting for it? Oh yeah.

597
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:23,440
So early 2020, there was nothing. And then this is this year, so it's not a lot for them.

598
01:00:23,830 --> 01:00:28,510
It's not a lot but enough and going, yeah, we'll talk about this in a second.

599
01:00:28,510 --> 01:00:32,830
So this is through August, I can tell you.

600
01:00:35,310 --> 01:00:40,830
Last like two weeks ago, I was at another meeting and we're up to 58 cases in the state of Michigan now.

601
01:00:41,610 --> 01:00:45,540
Okay. So and that's probably even changed since then, right?

602
01:00:45,580 --> 01:00:50,600
Like it's. So 31 cases and 27 patients.

603
01:00:50,610 --> 01:00:56,880
So you can have a couple different screening or colonize.

604
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:07,270
Cultures. So the first one back in May of 2021, that was really interesting because we were like, Oh my God, it's here.

605
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:12,140
And do I have his information? Well, here, we'll talk about this in a second.

606
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:16,210
But you can see, like most of these are appealing. Right.

607
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:21,070
Like they're appealing at either an acute care hospital, a long term acute care hospital and or a nursing home.

608
01:01:21,100 --> 01:01:23,140
Does everybody know what a long term acute care hospital is?

609
01:01:24,070 --> 01:01:30,310
So it's not quite a nursing home, but it's an acute care setting where people are having a lot of time.

610
01:01:32,700 --> 01:01:42,059
They require a lot of attention of acute care attention, but they're there for a long time, so they're not really mobile.

611
01:01:42,060 --> 01:01:48,480
There's a lot of devices and things and and it's not, yeah, in rehab.

612
01:01:49,350 --> 01:01:53,069
And then a nursing home is like a rehab. Like that's usually where they'll go after.

613
01:01:53,070 --> 01:01:57,460
But like, yeah. So. There's one.

614
01:02:00,380 --> 01:02:07,190
Multiple health care exposures are common in these patients within the last 90 days or so.

615
01:02:08,930 --> 01:02:14,000
There are also these places called the Snuffs or Ventilator skilled nursing facilities,

616
01:02:15,050 --> 01:02:19,300
which are again like we think of our ventilator units here at the hospital.

617
01:02:19,310 --> 01:02:25,580
They're very acute care, very oriented, like hospital or ICU level.

618
01:02:25,580 --> 01:02:33,340
But these are ventilator skilled nursing facilities where remember, the infection control education has not been great until the last year and a half.

619
01:02:33,350 --> 01:02:42,000
So thinking about what's happening in those types of places with ventilators and other types of care that needs to happen with the ventilator.

620
01:02:42,380 --> 01:02:52,160
So. Luckily. And I would say surprisingly, because I think we were kind of waiting for it to happen in and of itself, but it's not really there.

621
01:02:53,490 --> 01:02:55,280
It was. Yeah, for sure.

622
01:02:56,060 --> 01:03:02,780
There are also only like a handful of them in the state and I want to put a number on it, but it's like, you know, 15 or 18 or something like that.

623
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:07,380
Other risk factors for candida auris older age.

624
01:03:07,890 --> 01:03:15,810
Lots of indwelling devices. Reason mechanical ventilation, chronic or healing wounds.

625
01:03:16,950 --> 01:03:21,540
A history of Andro multidrug resistant organisms at any time.

626
01:03:21,570 --> 01:03:28,860
History of and then kind of your typical comorbid chronic lung disease diabetes renal disease the.

627
01:03:31,210 --> 01:03:37,600
Oh. So what else? To be honest about Canada or that very first one that we identified in 2021.

628
01:03:39,940 --> 01:03:40,930
He didn't fit the bill.

629
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:47,860
He was someone who had not traveled because historically we always thought it was someone who has traveled, who spent an overnight in a hospital.

630
01:03:48,460 --> 01:03:49,920
That was kind of our screening. Right.

631
01:03:50,410 --> 01:03:59,049
Even though we knew we had pockets in Illinois and New York, we still as a whole kind of treat it as an international MDR thing,

632
01:03:59,050 --> 01:04:05,710
because that's where it was that this individual had been had been abroad but had not had any hospitalization.

633
01:04:06,550 --> 01:04:10,840
He had hospitalization in California or something like, okay, whatever.

634
01:04:11,620 --> 01:04:15,640
But he had this weird it was an ear infection and it was kind order.

635
01:04:15,730 --> 01:04:20,290
It was the crazy. Like, everyone was just shocked. They were like, Are we sure? Are we sure our lab is there?

636
01:04:20,290 --> 01:04:26,709
And it was totally they sent it to our antibiotic resistant lab network.

637
01:04:26,710 --> 01:04:33,520
So this was created in 2016 when we were preparing for Candida Auris and when we were learning to.

638
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:44,129
Kind of detect more see and and all of these resistant organisms because the

639
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:49,650
antibiotic resistance in the lab and I'm not a lab person but like the testing

640
01:04:49,650 --> 01:04:53,400
was very challenging for a long time because there were different cutoffs and

641
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:56,400
there were different platforms and there were lots of different things that.

642
01:04:57,820 --> 01:05:01,180
Different hospitals would call the same thing.

643
01:05:01,700 --> 01:05:05,019
CPQ or not. Right. So there was this lack of standardization.

644
01:05:05,020 --> 01:05:10,990
So CDC was able to put on. Through funding an antibiotic resistant lab network.

645
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:21,090
And so there were seven labs across the country who were able to do more increased testing for CRC, visa versa,

646
01:05:21,890 --> 01:05:28,220
do a lot more whole genome sequencing, providing faster outbreak detection and response, better tracking resistance.

647
01:05:31,170 --> 01:05:39,909
So that's like kind of building onto this air threat. You can work with them to do colonization screening.

648
01:05:39,910 --> 01:05:48,390
So if there is something going on at the nursing home or we actually did this back in 2019, there was situation happening with.

649
01:05:50,130 --> 01:05:57,330
Well, it wasn't Canada or something else, and we had to go in and swab like 200 people and then send them off.

650
01:05:57,330 --> 01:06:01,080
And then, you know, I think it was it's made better, but.

651
01:06:02,170 --> 01:06:05,440
That level of testing isn't available at most state labs.

652
01:06:05,890 --> 01:06:11,110
We are again super fortunate. The State of Michigan, our state lab is phenomenal and could do that level of testing.

653
01:06:11,530 --> 01:06:15,490
But because they are aligned with their our regional lab is actually in Wisconsin so.

654
01:06:19,620 --> 01:06:29,570
Also on the sharp unit. This was kind of the education and consulting before all of this other craziness started with Candida, Auris and KPC.

655
01:06:30,930 --> 01:06:35,400
We used to just kind of go around and provide infection control, education to people.

656
01:06:36,060 --> 01:06:40,000
I would go to senior living communities and talk about washing your hands.

657
01:06:40,020 --> 01:06:44,729
We would go to gyms and talk about it. We would health care workers,

658
01:06:44,730 --> 01:06:52,620
schools just kind of providing that community level of infection control that local health departments don't have the capacity for.

659
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:57,900
Like everybody would love to go and talk to their local gym or their local school about this, but they just didn't have the capacity for it.

660
01:06:57,910 --> 01:07:01,260
So we were able to help supplement a lot of those places to do that.

661
01:07:02,940 --> 01:07:07,200
And then as part of COVID, I Pratt team came.

662
01:07:07,980 --> 01:07:15,710
So infection prevention resource and response is part of a in the response to Ebola,

663
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:19,830
we realized that infection control infrastructure was lacking everywhere.

664
01:07:19,860 --> 01:07:21,390
Right? It was not standardized,

665
01:07:21,780 --> 01:07:29,669
especially in long term care especially and under resourced like hospitals generally have to have some some level of infection control.

666
01:07:29,670 --> 01:07:33,360
But in other places, we knew that this wasn't a thing.

667
01:07:34,170 --> 01:07:40,860
So part of my job before I left was to provide onsite technical assistance to what other other type of health care facility needed it.

668
01:07:41,340 --> 01:07:49,379
I was at a lot of long term cares and things like that, and then COVID hit and they created a whole unit, which is kind of awesome.

669
01:07:49,380 --> 01:07:52,890
So they have regional infection prevention,

670
01:07:52,890 --> 01:08:03,690
US and regional data analysts who can provide local health departments and long term cares with infection control education,

671
01:08:03,690 --> 01:08:06,960
which I think is awesome because it's definitely needed.

672
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:11,100
They provide technical assistance with PPE.

673
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:14,880
That was such a hot button for a long time. I think maybe it still is.

674
01:08:15,060 --> 01:08:18,480
Even though our supplies are standard now that's stable.

675
01:08:18,510 --> 01:08:22,350
That standard, you know, recommendations on Cohorting residents.

676
01:08:22,350 --> 01:08:26,610
You know what? If I have someone who is colonized with this but is sick with this, and how do we put people in?

677
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:30,660
What do we do with our space constraints? Testing strategies?

678
01:08:31,970 --> 01:08:35,310
Staff exclusion. When do we work? When do we don't work? I was exposed to this.

679
01:08:35,330 --> 01:08:38,240
How long do I have to be out there?

680
01:08:38,250 --> 01:08:47,420
Staff will also look at infection prevention policies, procedures and practices as your is your surveillance plan up to what it should be.

681
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:51,620
Because the long term care standards are a little different.

682
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:57,440
They are you know, we are accredited by joint commission at the hospital.

683
01:08:57,860 --> 01:09:01,280
Long term care usually has on Medicare, not Medicare.

684
01:09:02,780 --> 01:09:07,430
CMS. CMS comes in, does it? Right. So but their standards are very like.

685
01:09:09,410 --> 01:09:12,690
You want to say open or loose, but they're very like generalized, right?

686
01:09:12,710 --> 01:09:16,070
They're very up here. So have a surveillance plan.

687
01:09:16,220 --> 01:09:17,660
Okay, great. I have a surveillance plan.

688
01:09:17,660 --> 01:09:25,460
But this these folks will come in and say, is your surveillance plan really working for your population, at your at your institution?

689
01:09:27,620 --> 01:09:38,570
They will help. Kind of digest and interpret CMS and CDC guidance, which we know is not always the easiest thing to read through.

690
01:09:41,810 --> 01:09:51,940
They also help with local health departments prioritizing. They're what they need to do with their at their places.

691
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:57,490
So there's that I it's it's pretty cool that they have this now it'll be again this is

692
01:09:57,490 --> 01:10:02,240
one of those things that I'm interested to see what will happen in the next five years. The world is going to be around.

693
01:10:02,270 --> 01:10:11,200
Yeah, I have a question. If you if you get a, you know, this swabbing experiment, this experiment surveillance.

694
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:17,140
You did. Yeah. How easy was it to get in the hospital, to get access to do that kind of thing?

695
01:10:17,150 --> 01:10:25,150
Because I talked to Brendon's. Yeah. She's you know, if you detect something and you have to go in and really difficult,

696
01:10:25,180 --> 01:10:32,380
it can be really challenging in that sense that Brenda, Sarah and I went in and did this and.

697
01:10:33,750 --> 01:10:39,390
I'm trying to remember now because the thing is, remember the way hospitals are in this country.

698
01:10:40,100 --> 01:10:43,309
We have private hospitals and we have nonprofit hospitals.

699
01:10:43,310 --> 01:10:46,620
Right. But they are they have to make money.

700
01:10:46,650 --> 01:10:51,840
You really have to, like, get the buy in of the leadership to be able to say, look,

701
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:56,100
this is what's best for your population right now because you have one person in

702
01:10:56,100 --> 01:11:00,629
this hospital or in this long term care that has this or maybe we had an outbreak.

703
01:11:00,630 --> 01:11:04,980
So we had two or three people. There's something going on.

704
01:11:04,990 --> 01:11:09,160
And if you for good press, you don't have to tell the press that we're coming in.

705
01:11:09,160 --> 01:11:14,080
But if you want to protect your your people and your residents, like, let us come in and help you.

706
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:20,169
We're not going to blast this all over the place. It's not our job. Our job is to come in and help you and and watch.

707
01:11:20,170 --> 01:11:23,620
And we know when we help you. I think it was leadership by end of that one week we were.

708
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:27,280
Yeah. Because. Because some places are very lucky. No, thank you.

709
01:11:27,490 --> 01:11:31,270
The issue I mean, this is, you know, it possible to go to bed. Oh, yeah.

710
01:11:31,450 --> 01:11:36,220
Something. And so and this is a problem with the health care system in general.

711
01:11:36,620 --> 01:11:40,570
I mean, I worked on a hospital's microbiome project.

712
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:48,590
Yeah. And so this hospital that by and except when we tried to try to talk about the kind of analysis they wanted, they said, absolutely not.

713
01:11:49,090 --> 01:11:52,350
We have to make sure that, you know, the hospital's okay.

714
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:58,690
We have to protect the hospital's reputation. We can who the going to do science under these circumstances.

715
01:11:58,780 --> 01:12:02,290
It's tricky but it's not just science is protecting public health.

716
01:12:02,650 --> 01:12:10,780
So you know, we at the beginning of the COVID pandemic, it was a lot of talk about, well, if in Wuhan,

717
01:12:10,780 --> 01:12:19,110
if they had taken action earlier and let people know we may not have had COVID all over the world, it's actually quite likely.

718
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:25,689
But if you look at it from a political administration point, it's perfectly understandable.

719
01:12:25,690 --> 01:12:33,180
And the same thing goes on in hospitals. So if you're an IP and you're not in a hospital, I mean, even if you events things like this happen.

720
01:12:33,190 --> 01:12:38,520
Right. But if you're at a small regional hospital, you know, you may be frightened to death.

721
01:12:38,530 --> 01:12:44,850
I mean, it's something just to keep in mind. It's because the hospital has got to balance their reputation.

722
01:12:45,880 --> 01:12:52,600
Right. Involved your leadership as soon as you can, because you might get a phone call from the unit and says, hey, you have this going on.

723
01:12:52,810 --> 01:12:55,840
What do you think about us coming in and helping your public health heart?

724
01:12:55,840 --> 01:13:01,780
We'll say yes. Come and come and look and see. But then, like you talk to your boss about it and have what are you doing?

725
01:13:01,780 --> 01:13:05,169
You can't do that. Why would you invite the state in? Oh, my God.

726
01:13:05,170 --> 01:13:11,260
Like what? I was doing all of the technical assistance that I was doing, like I would didn't know what I was walking into.

727
01:13:11,260 --> 01:13:16,419
A lot of the time, even the leadership knew I was coming in. Many times it was, Why are you here?

728
01:13:16,420 --> 01:13:20,139
What are you doing? Tell me why you're here. What does this report go to?

729
01:13:20,140 --> 01:13:22,570
How does this report get out? What are you actually looking at?

730
01:13:22,870 --> 01:13:26,559
You know, I even provide the tool before I went in, and I still had to, like, talk my way out of it.

731
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:32,980
And it was always fine. I never had anybody, like, yell at me, but those first 10 minutes every time were very like, could be tenuous because they.

732
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:37,540
You know, manufacturing controller said that you were coming in and I said, okay, but what?

733
01:13:37,550 --> 01:13:44,240
Who are you like? So just loop in your leadership and and use your people skills.

734
01:13:46,240 --> 01:13:49,280
You need good people. Yes.

735
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:53,030
Infection prevention. You are working with all kinds of people. So that is the last section.

736
01:13:53,990 --> 01:13:59,030
Other entities that you might work in or work with. So we've talked about the Bureau of Labs a lot.

737
01:13:59,710 --> 01:14:06,170
Their website is great. If you ever need to know kind of what testing they are able to offer that it is a testing

738
01:14:06,170 --> 01:14:10,610
link is great and then test request forms here at our hospital again we have the lab.

739
01:14:10,610 --> 01:14:11,389
They all know us,

740
01:14:11,390 --> 01:14:18,170
but your little local hospital may not know all of the forms because everything needs a form and everything needs to be signed and everything else.

741
01:14:18,170 --> 01:14:20,899
But and it's particularly careful.

742
01:14:20,900 --> 01:14:25,760
You would be particularly careful with lab specimens because if they're not labeled and dated with the form chain of command,

743
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:29,660
all those things will be tested. And then you won't know that you have monkeypox.

744
01:14:30,140 --> 01:14:36,290
That happened. So. Bureau of Emergency Preparedness Items and Systems of Care.

745
01:14:37,130 --> 01:14:43,640
This was the I don't know of supply, health preparedness and everything else in the last 20 years has changed a bunch of times.

746
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:54,489
But this is making sure that you have a level of emergency preparedness and response at your facility.

747
01:14:54,490 --> 01:15:01,690
And I, I worked with them a time. I also did Special Pathogen Readiness when I worked with the state doing Ebola readiness.

748
01:15:01,690 --> 01:15:07,389
And so we were not ready. And our partners were very much the the deeper folks.

749
01:15:07,390 --> 01:15:16,240
So every hospital has an emergency management organization who has to report through the assistant preparedness.

750
01:15:16,330 --> 01:15:22,420
Assistant Secretary of Preparedness and Response. There's all other kinds of federal entities here that are in play that we never knew.

751
01:15:22,420 --> 01:15:28,000
Infection control had so much kind of overlapped with until the last five or eight years, I think.

752
01:15:30,810 --> 01:15:36,060
Just kind of a reminder of Michigan emergency management. And I think this is pretty standard across federal emergency management.

753
01:15:37,470 --> 01:15:40,440
All emergencies are local and you have to like report up.

754
01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:47,549
So your local emergency management kind of engages the next level of emergency management, which engages the state, which manages the governor,

755
01:15:47,550 --> 01:15:52,530
which is, you know, so when you hear about like, you know, FEMA resources, it's because everybody below has requested up.

756
01:15:55,580 --> 01:15:59,720
And that's the here's the cycle of emergency preparedness collaboration.

757
01:16:00,710 --> 01:16:07,070
All of this, you know, public health as hospitals and public health are a crucial part of this wheel of collaboration.

758
01:16:07,460 --> 01:16:11,390
And I think that Ebola really tested this.

759
01:16:15,140 --> 01:16:18,580
Over the last few years and it's coming back so much.

760
01:16:18,590 --> 01:16:21,650
Uganda, we're starting to do travel screening and things like that again.

761
01:16:22,220 --> 01:16:32,140
But. You know. Quickly with Ebola, public health would identify someone and if that person was showing up at a hospital.

762
01:16:33,610 --> 01:16:36,910
What kind of precautions would you need? Who would need to be there?

763
01:16:37,330 --> 01:16:40,959
Who would need to be engaged in the hospital leadership on down to make sure

764
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:44,050
that that patient was safe because you don't want to be the Ebola hospital. Right.

765
01:16:44,140 --> 01:16:50,340
Like you don't want your name tarnished. Do you need law enforcement there or do you need your local law enforcement?

766
01:16:50,350 --> 01:16:57,930
Do you need security? What do you do with the waste that is that comes from this patient?

767
01:17:01,620 --> 01:17:06,510
Where? Yeah, there's lots of connected wheels that I think you will talk about with.

768
01:17:07,430 --> 01:17:13,490
Dr. Cynthia when he's here. If you're working at a hospital, make sure you get into your health alert network.

769
01:17:13,510 --> 01:17:15,910
Michigan has the my hand and you can get all kinds of.

770
01:17:17,310 --> 01:17:23,790
Alerts I think we get I don't know if you look at this point with immunizations and everything else,

771
01:17:23,790 --> 01:17:29,130
but, you know, this was from 2016 where we were getting Legionnaires, Zika.

772
01:17:29,190 --> 01:17:39,469
Happy to go back to the days of that like. And then I think I mentioned this early on here is our aid preparedness region that there's no reason for.

773
01:17:39,470 --> 01:17:44,920
We have to reach into North American to sell. Each region has a medical director,

774
01:17:44,920 --> 01:17:52,240
a bioterrorism coordinator and a regional epidemiologist who's employed through the State Health Department division to sample disease.

775
01:17:55,730 --> 01:18:04,280
There's this strategic national stockpile some of you might know about. This is where we keep a lot of masks, flu vaccines, things like that,

776
01:18:04,550 --> 01:18:10,220
and strategic places around to make sure that we can deploy them in an event of an emergency.

777
01:18:10,970 --> 01:18:14,120
This makes me think back to H1N1 in 2009.

778
01:18:16,330 --> 01:18:21,750
Where. And then after that, we got a lot of masks that. Expired before going needed them again.

779
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:28,630
So I think now there's a better mechanism to kind of keep things flowing because we recognize that that was kind of a large list.

780
01:18:30,410 --> 01:18:33,710
My OSHA. Oh.

781
01:18:33,890 --> 01:18:42,230
Is your friend mostly? Yeah. In Michigan, it's the line which operates under the licensing and regulatory affairs folks.

782
01:18:43,010 --> 01:18:53,810
They're great. They have health care folks that can help you with anything, but they will speak legal at you because they are very legal oriented.

783
01:18:55,810 --> 01:19:00,700
But Laura also has the health care facilities engineering folks who will also be your best friends.

784
01:19:01,210 --> 01:19:03,940
If you are working at a hospital that likes to build hospitals,

785
01:19:06,430 --> 01:19:13,659
you have to engage the engineers early on to make sure that your urban isolation rooms are where they are and make sure you have Antero.

786
01:19:13,660 --> 01:19:17,620
So make sure I don't miss anything, anything.

787
01:19:17,620 --> 01:19:21,790
You know, make sure you are involved in any construction early on if you're an IP,

788
01:19:22,750 --> 01:19:28,090
because the last thing you want to do is go on the final walk through and be like I to do that,

789
01:19:28,330 --> 01:19:32,530
everybody looks at you and you're like, Well, it doesn't make any sense from an infection prevention standpoint.

790
01:19:32,530 --> 01:19:36,940
And then they spent all this money building a hospital that it's Rear Vision.

791
01:19:37,960 --> 01:19:45,930
But there are a handful of engineers at the state who love to talk about building things and hospitals and stuff like that,

792
01:19:45,930 --> 01:19:53,190
and they're a great resource. Immunizations again at Michigan Medicine.

793
01:19:53,190 --> 01:19:58,919
We're lucky because like our oh, we have a separate you guys know Dr. Stone and she's our medical director for OHSU.

794
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:07,470
So her she and her group do a lot of our employee vaccination and so adjust activities.

795
01:20:07,950 --> 01:20:12,330
But if you're at a local hospital, you might be a waitress.

796
01:20:12,450 --> 01:20:16,650
So knowing about vaccination and in Michigan, we have the Medicare,

797
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:21,600
which is the Michigan Care Improvement Registry, which everybody's vaccinations go into.

798
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:27,720
And if you look it up and just so that, you know, if you've been vaccinated in Michigan, it's on MCR.

799
01:20:28,740 --> 01:20:33,510
So if you want to look up your vaccination history, if you can't remember, you can do that.

800
01:20:33,510 --> 01:20:37,900
Yep. Really helpful. It's really cool. Yeah. I don't know.

801
01:20:37,910 --> 01:20:42,270
I have questions. It's a lot. So that was just great.

802
01:20:42,350 --> 01:20:49,320
But I was going to say so back to that. Health Facilities Engineering, how do you guys do it?

803
01:20:51,390 --> 01:20:55,830
So Kristine Vander Olsen is our construction infection prevention is she's been involved from the start

804
01:20:57,990 --> 01:21:01,980
because it was part like the construction was positive during the pandemic and it's just starting again.

805
01:21:03,420 --> 01:21:09,899
We are back on a weekly rotation of rounding to make sure that everything right now because it's still all outside, we're not so concerned.

806
01:21:09,900 --> 01:21:16,950
But in the design part of it, she was pretty involved in knowing what was where and like the whole sink situation of sinks,

807
01:21:17,190 --> 01:21:26,610
proximity to a bed and stuff like that. Like you don't want to splash down and but once the construction starts inside, I suspect we'll be there more.

808
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:30,180
We do weekly construction rounds on anything that's happening in the hospital.

809
01:21:30,180 --> 01:21:38,940
So, you know, making sure that there is no dust anywhere and making sure that it's negative to, you know, that's not blowing anything out.

810
01:21:38,940 --> 01:21:45,000
And yeah, making sure that they've posted their RA, which is infection control, risk assessment and they have to.

811
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:51,810
So we're pretty involved. But in this new one that the design was pre me and I understand that there was a lot of

812
01:21:52,230 --> 01:21:55,740
meetings and now that they're about to close it and I'm sure we'll start going back.

813
01:21:57,180 --> 01:22:04,350
The questions. So it is really important to know what resources are available to you.

814
01:22:06,630 --> 01:22:09,190
These kind of lectures, sometimes you feel like zoning out.

815
01:22:09,420 --> 01:22:15,899
I help but but the fact is it is really important to know what resources are available to you.

816
01:22:15,900 --> 01:22:25,680
And you are extremely fortunate now because it used to be you have to have the library and pull all these records and just tell the story.

817
01:22:25,680 --> 01:22:30,270
So I had a class where we had this long thing like this and I was and then we had to do

818
01:22:30,270 --> 01:22:37,919
a paper and then the instructor randomly assigned us to topics and that design thing.

819
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:44,430
And I hadn't been paying registering cards and his like, so it's like, why didn't you just do the registry?

820
01:22:44,430 --> 01:22:46,830
It's like registry office. You okay?

821
01:22:47,250 --> 01:22:55,500
So just this is one of those things that you just want to know that there are resources available and like they're creating new things all the time.

822
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:59,010
Like, I just yeah, yeah, it's brand new.

823
01:23:00,060 --> 01:23:05,590
So staying on top of that kind of thing is really can be very helpful.

824
01:23:06,990 --> 01:23:12,160
Yeah. And if nothing else, I hope just take away like, oh, I remember she was talking about something and it's like think about, you know,

825
01:23:12,180 --> 01:23:22,010
like you don't have to remember all of the details, but just think of, all right, construction resources available and legitimate, I guess.

826
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:25,739
Right. And validated and talk to your IP friends.

827
01:23:25,740 --> 01:23:27,390
That's the other thing as an infection prevention.

828
01:23:27,480 --> 01:23:34,200
So you have to really like collaborate and especially if you're a once a year at a hospital like you have to have colleagues who are.

829
01:23:35,050 --> 01:23:38,500
Also. And for your first job, do not take a job at a small house.

830
01:23:38,530 --> 01:23:41,890
No. And there's only maybe you and one other. I don't do it.

831
01:23:42,220 --> 01:23:43,390
You'll bear yourself out. Really?

832
01:23:43,390 --> 01:23:49,900
Like I know a lot of people who have burned themselves out just thinking that they can jump right in because this is the nothing was going on.

833
01:23:49,900 --> 01:23:54,490
And then Ebola or measles. Measles hit. I mean, measles we could contain.

834
01:23:54,500 --> 01:23:59,110
Right. But it was just too much so because all of a sudden you're the star, right?

835
01:23:59,140 --> 01:24:00,580
Nobody knows you're there until there's a problem.

836
01:24:00,580 --> 01:24:06,190
So you don't want to be the one on the news saying we don't have a measles problem here with the measles person walking in front of you or something.

837
01:24:07,510 --> 01:24:15,450
And then to know that there's a lot of diseases there, like three is very familiar with TB because she works in it.

838
01:24:15,820 --> 01:24:22,510
But there's so many more. You look when you want to look it up and make sure and no, there's no prophylaxis but.

839
01:24:25,470 --> 01:24:28,170
There is no real that there's no vaccine. Yeah.

840
01:24:28,170 --> 01:24:33,140
I mean we there's have BCG vaccine but we don't the administering to us and it doesn't help with your expense.

841
01:24:33,210 --> 01:24:37,170
Right. So those are the kind of things that you want to know.

842
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:42,680
Yeah. And I guess my last plug will be as an IP and joint APIC.

843
01:24:42,690 --> 01:24:45,900
It's the Association for Professionals in Infection Prevention.

844
01:24:46,350 --> 01:24:50,870
And it's a great. Resource and networking and.

845
01:24:52,130 --> 01:24:57,230
And they have regional meetings. They do. I'm the current president. So would you try to move it up?

846
01:24:57,230 --> 01:25:01,610
Because I always urge people to go to the local meeting if they're looking for a job.

847
01:25:01,790 --> 01:25:06,750
Oh, yeah, we actually just had one. We had a meeting in Lansing in October.

848
01:25:06,770 --> 01:25:12,020
It was our first in-person meeting since the pandemic, and we had 100 people and it was really great and fun to see people again.

849
01:25:12,020 --> 01:25:19,909
And the networking is great. I've met some of my close friends, you know, just in the network, and I, like I said,

850
01:25:19,910 --> 01:25:24,620
I started at the state joining as the infection prevention list because I thought that's how I could infiltrate the IP.

851
01:25:24,620 --> 01:25:32,540
This was joining that joining the. But no, it's a great organization, both locally and nationally.

852
01:25:32,690 --> 01:25:36,739
There are members from all over the state. We have 250 something members.

853
01:25:36,740 --> 01:25:41,569
I think right now we're trying to get more long term care and we're trying to do programs

854
01:25:41,570 --> 01:25:46,520
that are applicable to long term care and acute care and just kind of all care settings.

855
01:25:49,060 --> 01:25:52,860
You're saying let's bring the goods? I don't know if we're going to do a spring spring meeting yet.

856
01:25:52,870 --> 01:25:58,030
We'll kind of wait and see what happens with the. With what's going on with COVID.

857
01:25:58,240 --> 01:26:06,129
We do have an educator. It's an online educational opportunity on November 16th for ambulatory care,

858
01:26:06,130 --> 01:26:13,330
infection prevention us because that's kind of a new up and coming field now to whoever knew that that was a thing like five or six years ago.

859
01:26:13,330 --> 01:26:16,479
But now we have dedicated, you know, inventory care,

860
01:26:16,480 --> 01:26:21,250
infection prevention us and I think that's Jenny Buhler from Henry Ford is going to be talking about that.

861
01:26:21,820 --> 01:26:26,910
So but yeah, you can email me if you need more information about about ethicon.

862
01:26:27,130 --> 01:26:34,570
Okay. And there is a national meeting which if in particularly if you're looking for jobs nationally and it's in Orlando in June,

863
01:26:34,750 --> 01:26:38,260
easier part the end of June too.

864
01:26:38,260 --> 01:26:46,389
It's like June 26 to the 28th. Yeah, but we have had students that posters there who worked in the hospital.

865
01:26:46,390 --> 01:26:50,440
So that's something that you can think about. It's a great way to meet people.

866
01:26:50,440 --> 01:26:55,179
And one of our interns from last year was best new investigator at National Epic last year.

867
01:26:55,180 --> 01:27:00,040
So. Yeah, yeah. Well, let's take my thanks guys.

868
01:27:10,730 --> 01:27:15,620
So we'll take a break while we wait for our next speaker.

869
01:27:19,220 --> 01:27:24,200
I do want to remind everybody to please that there is the clash.

870
01:27:24,200 --> 01:27:28,790
Next week is the symposium. Everybody knows that.

871
01:27:32,240 --> 01:27:34,510
What in the world is tomato sauce?
