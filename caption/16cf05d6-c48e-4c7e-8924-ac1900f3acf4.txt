00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Population health, part four death rates in the first segment of this lecture,

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
we defined and illustrated the concepts of health, public health and population health.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
In the second and third segments, we illustrated these concepts by focusing on two key measures of population health,

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,000
infant mortality and life expectancy. In this segment, we will focus on another important measure of population health.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Death rates. As before, we need to define a few concepts.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The overall death rate is usually defined to be the number of deaths per 100000 population in a given year.

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:53,000
This sounds simple enough, but as with infant mortality and life expectancy, there are some subtleties to the definition that need to be explained.

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Not surprisingly, the age structure of the U.S. population has changed significantly over time.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Back in nineteen hundred, the median age was about twenty three, while in 2016 the median age had increased to almost 38.

10
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:21,000
In other words, collectively we have grown older since mortality or risk of death is to a great extent a function of age.

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It is not appropriate to compare crude or non age adjusted death rates from different

12
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
time periods since the age structures of the underlying populations differ.

13
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Kind of like comparing apples and oranges in order to make such comparisons valid.

14
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:46,000
We need to adjust or age, standardize the populations to a common age distribution or structure all the overall death rates.

15
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
We will examine here or age standardized.

16
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Finally, a cause specific death rate is the number of deaths due to a specific cause per hundred thousand population in a given year.

17
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Again, the cost specific death rates we will examine are age standardized.

18
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The leading causes of death and the associated death rates in the United States have changed dramatically over time.

19
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:24,000
The overall death rate in nineteen hundred was over seventeen hundred deaths per 100000 per year by 2016.

20
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
The overall death rate had declined by almost 58 percent.

21
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
In addition to the significant decline in the overall death rate is the fact that the

22
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:42,000
top 10 causes of death have shifted from mostly infectious diseases such as pneumonia,

23
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:52,000
flu, tuberculosis, diarrheal diseases and diphtheria to mostly chronic diseases such as heart disease and stroke,

24
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:00,000
cancer, chronic lower respiratory disease, Alzheimer's disease and diabetes.

25
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
We call this shift from mostly infectious disease deaths to mostly chronic disease deaths.

26
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:13,000
The epidemiological transition. We will talk more about this concept in later lectures.

27
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:24,000
There are a number of other notable details in these tables. The combined death rate from heart disease and stroke have declined by about 17 percent.

28
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:32,000
But this masks the fact that in the 1950s, the combined rates were far higher than they are today.

29
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:39,000
There's been a huge decline since the 1950s. We'll talk more about this soon.

30
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Another observation is that the death rate from all cancers has more than doubled in 2016 from what it had been in nineteen hundred.

31
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
However, as we shall see, the patterns for individual types of cancer have varied.

32
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Some have gone up. Some have gone down. And some have gone up and then down.

33
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,000
In other words, cancer is not a single disease, but rather a collection of diseases,

34
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:18,000
each of which has its own biology and natural history, which means that each requires its own strategy for control.

35
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
As previously noted, it is important to emphasize that each type of cancer has its own unique biology.

36
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:34,000
So there is no single or universal explanation for the temporal patterns of change in individual cancer death rates over the last hundred years or so.

37
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Also, there are some obvious differences in biology between men and women.

38
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Obviously, men can't get cervical cancer and women can't get prostate cancer.

39
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
So this discussion will look at men and women separately.

40
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:55,000
But keep in mind, there is also considerable overlap for many specific types of cancer that can occur in both men and women.

41
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:02,000
One can see from the graph that deaths from lung cancer among women were almost nonexistent in nineteen hundred.

42
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:09,000
But since 1990, lung cancer has been the leading cause of cancer death among women in the United States.

43
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:17,000
The most significant underlying factor that explains the rise and recent slight fall in lung cancer deaths is tobacco smoking.

44
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:27,000
We will see a similar pattern among men, though, with an earlier onset and much higher peak rate of death for many years.

45
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Breast cancer, the relatively constant, was the leading cause of cancer death among women until being overtaken by lung cancer and about 1990.

46
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Since that time, the death rate for breast cancer has seen a significant and sustained decline in

47
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
a number of factors have contributed to this decline in breast cancer deaths,

48
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:56,000
including more widespread use of screening mammography and also better treatments for breast cancer.

49
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:04,000
The death rate for stomach cancer has shown an enormous and sustained decline in both men and women over the 20th century.

50
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:16,000
The explanation may be less well understood, but a large part is probably related to improve methods of food storage and preservation.

51
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:26,000
In the early part of the 20th century, there was no refrigeration as we know it today, and certain chemicals, nitrates and nitrates,

52
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:35,000
both known or suspected human carcinogens, were widely used as food preservatives and in high concentrations.

53
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Beginning in 1926, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued the first regulations governing use of nitrates in nitrates as food preservatives,

54
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
which greatly reduce the allowable concentrations of these chemicals in foods.

55
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Also, for reasons that are not well understood but may be related to improved general sanitation infection with the organism.

56
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Helicobacter pylori, a known risk factor for stomach cancer, has declined.

57
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
The death rate for primary cancer of the liver has also declined.

58
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:18,000
This, in part reflects the much reduced rate of chronic hepatitis infections such as hepatitis B and hepatitis C.

59
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Also important in this context is improved food storage preservation leading to

60
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,000
reduction and contamination of many foods with a substance called aflatoxin.

61
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:36,000
A well-known human liver carcinogen produced by certain fungi that could contaminate food food

62
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:42,000
contamination with aflatoxin is still widespread in many less developed countries in the world,

63
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:52,000
along with chronic infectious hepatitis and consequently a much higher death rate from liver cancer prevails in those countries.

64
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
We have seen this graph before.

65
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:05,000
It provides a clear illustration of the close relationship between cigaret smoking and the rise and subsequent fall and deaths from lung cancer.

66
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
In addition to lung cancer,

67
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:19,000
cigaret smoking is also an important cause for many other cancers and also of heart disease and chronic lower respiratory disease.

68
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Many of the specific patterns of cancer seen in women are also evident in men.

69
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
So, for example, the fall in the death rate for stomach cancer is similar among men and women.

70
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,000
The pattern of the rise and fall and the death rate for lung cancer is also evident among men.

71
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:45,000
But the initial onset was earlier and the peak was much higher, reflecting earlier and more widespread smoking among men compared to women.

72
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Over the course of the 20th century, colorectal cancer is still a leading cause of cancer deaths.

73
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,000
But the death rate among men has declined by almost 50 percent since the mid 1980s.

74
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:08,000
This is likely a combination of more widespread screening, such as call an Oscar P. and also reduction in risk factors such as reduction in smoking.

75
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Women have also experienced the decline in colorectal cancer.

76
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:24,000
So far, we have focused a lot of attention on cancer death rates in some of the underlying reasons for why they have changed.

77
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:31,000
But remember that heart disease is the leading cause of death, and stroke is also among the top 10 causes of death.

78
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:41,000
This slide displays the historical pattern of death for total cardiovascular disease, which includes both diseases of the heart and stroke.

79
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
There's some interesting patterns.

80
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:52,000
The overall death rate from diseases of the heart, the Dasht curve on the graph is only slightly lower today than what it was in nineteen hundred.

81
00:09:52,000 --> 00:10:00,000
But remarkably, in 1950, the death rate for diseases of the heart was about double what it is today.

82
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:07,000
So why did the rate go up during the first half of the 20th century and then why did it come back down?

83
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,000
There are a number of important contributing factors for the rise. Smoking increased a lot.

84
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,000
The average diet changed to include more fat and salt, and people exercise less.

85
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Also, there was little or no effective medical treatment for key risk factors for heart disease, such as high blood pressure and high cholesterol.

86
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Later, during the 1960s, drug treatment for high blood pressure began to improve.

87
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
And this has continued smoking rates have been in decline.

88
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:45,000
And later, highly effective drugs for elevated cholesterol have become available and used widely.

89
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:56,000
And finally, much more effective medical therapies for people with heart disease have become available.

90
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
To recap, population health is more than just numbers.

91
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
It can reveal trends. It allows for comparisons, for assessment of patterns in the data.

92
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,000
The data can provide for identification of underlying causes or explanations of trends.

93
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
And importantly, the data can provide a basis for public health interventions.

94
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:26,636
These ideas will recur throughout this course.
