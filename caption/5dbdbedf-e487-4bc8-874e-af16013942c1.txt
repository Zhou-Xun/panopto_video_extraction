1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,150
All right. It's 3:00. I don't want to cut into anyone's time today.

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,360
Before we get started, just a quick overview of where we are in the semester officially.

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:17,430
Seventh class period. I'm 28, so the 25% mark one quarter of the way.

4
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,600
So hopefully we're all learning some things.

5
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,720
I know I am, and we'll keep it going.

6
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:30,990
Once again today we have a guest lecture Thursday on Talk about Occupational.

7
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:37,140
Then next Thursday, we have our first quiz, which we'll talk about more in upcoming class periods.

8
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,970
But for today, you are all lucky in that you have a guest lecture.

9
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:46,870
And today we have Professor Tim Devonshire,

10
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:53,280
who is the associate chair of the Department of Environmental Sciences and is

11
00:00:53,280 --> 00:01:00,260
an expert in measuring exposure to ambient air pollution as well as health.

12
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:08,040
So I thought, who better to come talk about regulations in the environmental realm than our own experts?

13
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:13,170
So thank you for being here and I will get out of your way.

14
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:20,130
All right. Thank you so much, Professor Meeker. Thrilled to be with you all this afternoon.

15
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,010
And I can only imagine that you're really excited to learn about the environmental standards and regulations, right?

16
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,000
All right. Yeah. Oh, look at that excitement. I appreciate that. Thank you so much.

17
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:35,489
Yeah, I was trying to keep your eye on the corner, John, to look at the class schedule.

18
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:41,280
Did you talk about kind of the analogies on in the workplace setting of every Thursday?

19
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:50,730
Okay. So that's that's yet to come. So this will kind of introduce a lot of alphabet soup with agencies and congressional acts and this type of thing.

20
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,889
But bear with me, we'll get to a little bit of kind of application, right?

21
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:02,010
So some basic learning objectives to understand what those agencies and organizations are.

22
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:08,310
We're really going to focus on the U.S. probably through the first 70 minutes or so, maybe the last couple of minutes.

23
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:13,140
We can we can peel out and talk a little bit about on a global perspective,

24
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:23,790
but how exposure standards and regulations are set up to talk about the scope and some of the temporal trends of the

25
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:30,839
levels of various contaminants within the context of standards and regulations and then understand the differences.

26
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:40,860
This is important between a standard and a guideline in the role that the different agencies and organizations have kind of in this process.

27
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:52,819
So this is an interesting slide and it applies, you know, not just to kind of the community environmental aspect,

28
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:56,840
but very much so within occupational workplace settings.

29
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:07,400
It's really easy for us to utilize science and understand the reality, the truth of cause and effect.

30
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:20,330
And we can apply natural sciences and social sciences to address the problem and come up with a standard that is safe and protective of health.

31
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:32,000
The reality is everything other than science is that comes into play and it puts up challenge and hurdle and barrier.

32
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:37,700
And so even if we do, sometimes we don't actually arrive at a standard.

33
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:46,670
And in some cases where even when we do, it's less than ideal because it wasn't truly a scientific process.

34
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:51,920
It was impacted by a lot of things through the policy realm.

35
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:57,260
We'll revisit that aspect a couple of times.

36
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:06,380
All right. So a quick overview of some of the major federal regulatory agencies and again around community and environmental related exposures.

37
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:12,170
We do have the EPA, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Transportation,

38
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:17,030
the Department of Agriculture, as well as the Department of the Interior.

39
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:26,930
There are other federal agencies that do have responsibilities, but they don't have a regulatory compliance.

40
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:34,730
They are merely providing guidelines, technical information in support of this process.

41
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:37,550
But it's really a non regulatory role.

42
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:46,790
And so some examples of that are the CDC, which within the CDC includes the the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry,

43
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:53,390
as well as the National Center for Environmental Health. It also includes all of our National Institutes of Health.

44
00:04:53,900 --> 00:05:01,220
Right. And perhaps the one most relevant to environmental and community exposure is the National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences.

45
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:10,070
And again, these agencies provide an important support role through guidelines and scientific information and technical assistance.

46
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:18,910
But they don't play a regulatory role. We're not going to go through all of this in detail.

47
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,040
But I did want to highlight a couple of things. It's a little bit difficult to follow.

48
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:30,870
It's kind of a two columns. There should be stacks, but instead they're side by side because of a landscape slide.

49
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:36,070
So imagine these two being follow these two kind of going down.

50
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:41,290
So if we follow the U.S., what I really want to draw your eye to,

51
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:52,240
these are some of the the milestone regulatory accident initiatives that have taken place and been implemented on the U.S. side.

52
00:05:52,660 --> 00:06:01,750
We were pretty productive through the 1970s and 1980s and maybe even into the early 1990 as a comparison.

53
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:06,370
It's looking at some related initiatives in the European Union.

54
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:17,440
And as you can see there, they're starting in the 1980s, but going through the nineties and well into the 2000 more substantial milestones.

55
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:25,930
And, you know, unfortunately, the timeline when Professor Meeker presents this, the next class period on the occupational side looks very similar.

56
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:33,399
So we've been productive over previous decades, but over the most recent decades, not so much.

57
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:38,260
And we'll come back full circle and discuss some of the reasons for perhaps why that's the case.

58
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:47,260
All right. So I'm going to go through and highlight a couple of these major agencies and some of the facts that are related to each.

59
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:56,020
The first agency we'll talk about is the EPA, which its mission here is to protect human health and to safeguard the natural environment.

60
00:06:56,470 --> 00:07:00,370
So air, water and land on which life depends.

61
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:15,170
And then the EPA derives its regulatory authority from these several congressional legislative acts, these key ones, meaning the Clean Air Act,

62
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:22,310
the Clean Water Act Superfund, the Sierra Safe Water Drinking Act,

63
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:29,810
amendments to the Superfund, as well as the task of the Toxic Substances Control Act.

64
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:40,190
And we'll touch on each one of these here. So starting with the Clean Air Act, it was originally legislated in 1970,

65
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:46,580
and then there were formal amendments to it, both in 1977 and then again in 1990.

66
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:54,530
And will highlight this. John mentioned that my background is around issues of air quality and impact on health.

67
00:07:54,950 --> 00:08:02,390
And so I tend to choose examples that are a little bit closer to my passion and an interest that we'll we'll clue in here on the Clean Air Act.

68
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:09,949
As we get a little bit later in the class period. But the Clean Air Act is regulating emissions for both stationary and mobile sources.

69
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:16,470
Right. So traditional smokestacks as well as, you know, cars, busses, airplanes, etc.

70
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:26,480
Uh, couple of things here. There are national ambient air quality standards for six primary or criteria pollutants.

71
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:29,030
We'll talk about this specifically in a minute.

72
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:37,720
But this these are standards that exist to regulate what is the allowable concentration in ambient air right.

73
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:46,160
In the outdoor environment. Contrasting that once we get to the 1990, amendments to the Clean Air Act was, as are added,

74
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:55,340
this list of hazardous air pollutants, 189 of them are chemicals that are not regulated by their concentration and air.

75
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:04,940
This regulation was aimed at controlling emissions, so certain amounts that are allowed to be emitted from emission sources.

76
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:17,530
The Clean Water Act in terms of the way it was structured, was very similar to the Clean Air Act and they were very good points in time.

77
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:21,190
So the Clean Water Act was legislated in 1972.

78
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:25,390
There were subsequent amendments in 77 and 1987,

79
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:34,000
and its goal is to to maintain or even improve the cleanliness and integrity of our of our nation's water bodies.

80
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:38,530
Uh, let's see, uh, you know, nationwide criteria.

81
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:52,120
Um, can I come back to this in a minute? Related is the Safe Drinking Water Act 1974 and then amendments in 1986 and 1996 related.

82
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:55,389
But this is aimed specifically at finished drinking water.

83
00:09:55,390 --> 00:10:08,320
So basically tap water primarily through municipal water systems and it's targeted at both chemical and biological contaminants within that system.

84
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:17,650
Uh, there are a couple different sets of standards, but yeah, this is where I wanted to come back to the Primary Enforcement Authority,

85
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:24,460
and this is the case with the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act in addition to the Safe Drinking Water Act,

86
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:32,620
even though these are federal pieces of legislation that have federal level regulatory oversight,

87
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:39,070
much of it is managed from an enforcement perspective within the individual states.

88
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:45,400
So the states are the ones that actually implement these federal level legislative acts.

89
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,570
And there's yeah, there's actually a no, this is also an important one.

90
00:10:49,960 --> 00:11:00,400
There is a process by which states can actually set standards or regulations that are more strict than those set at the federal level.

91
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:06,459
They can't lessen them. Right? They can't be less strict, but they can make them more strict.

92
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,630
The states have that right.

93
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:15,910
A really good example is the state of California that tends to be more strict and pretty much every environmental standard or regulation.

94
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:22,300
Yeah. Question I'm just wondering if, you know, a ballpark of how many states just set more restrictions?

95
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:28,630
Not that many. Yeah. I mean, you know, California would be the kind of the extreme example in that case.

96
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:40,470
It's actually not just as simple as saying, yeah, we want to do it. It's a it's a long and laborious process to be able to tap into that.

97
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:49,290
And so that's that's one of the reasons why. But it's also a lot easier from a resource perspective, uh, to not try to recreate the wheel,

98
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:53,460
so to speak, if it's already been done through a long and labors process at the federal level.

99
00:11:55,810 --> 00:12:00,770
Moving on to a couple of these other legislative acts, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.

100
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:08,110
This was originally legislated in 1970 with some subsequent amendments.

101
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:14,860
It states wherever feasible, the generation of hazardous waste is to be reduced or eliminated.

102
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,610
So waste is nevertheless generated, should be stored,

103
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:25,120
treated and disposed of so as to minimize the present and future threat to human health and the environment.

104
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:35,470
And as you can imagine, this authority under this act requires some very complex perspective exposure assessments.

105
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:43,300
So looking into the future, right. Predicting what might be the case in the event of the generation of hazardous waste.

106
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:47,380
An example might be a proposed hazardous waste disposal site.

107
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:53,160
Right. Wants to be built here. What are going to be the effects on the environment and the surrounding population?

108
00:12:53,170 --> 00:13:04,150
So a lot of implementation of exposure models and exposure assessment to help inform whether such a site should be approved to go forward.

109
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:15,370
Superfund or the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act was legislated in 1980.

110
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:19,180
And this is the authority around hazardous waste cleanup.

111
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:26,560
Right. So we do have these as well. There are massive contamination of specific sites.

112
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:36,370
Importantly, and this was able to address the recovery of remediation costs for responsible parties.

113
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:43,840
In a lot of cases, though, it's easier said than done because there's a legacy of pollutants or contaminants.

114
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,720
They're not discovered for perhaps decades after it occurred.

115
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:53,110
And perhaps, you know, those businesses or companies that were originally responsible are no longer in existence.

116
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:59,650
It was amended in 1986 by the Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act.

117
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:05,860
And basically what it does is identifies the highest priority sites based on a combination of things,

118
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:11,230
based on the toxicity of the agents present, but also the likelihood of exposure.

119
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:17,080
If it's a contaminated site, it's relatively secluded and controlled and is a minimal risk.

120
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:22,090
It's not going to rank as high on the list, whereas if it's very nearby,

121
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:27,340
perhaps a large population center, this would make it much more of a priority.

122
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:36,730
The Toxic Substances Control Act. This was legislated in 1976.

123
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:39,610
I'm not going to go through too much of the detail here.

124
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:47,110
If implemented, some labeling requirements and tolerance levels, in some cases some outright bans.

125
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:54,190
However, it's important to note that it's only banned a handful of chemicals in total under this rule,

126
00:14:54,190 --> 00:15:00,160
and none since 1991 since that court ruling on a proposed asbestos phaseout.

127
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:08,790
This was updated much more recently in 2016 by the Law for Chemical Safety Act.

128
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:17,920
So this added some some much needed improvements to Tosca as a mandatory requirement

129
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:22,810
for EPA to evaluate existing chemicals with clear and enforceable guidelines,

130
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:31,000
a new risk based safety standard, increased public transparency of chemical information that's out there.

131
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:42,580
And then, you know, if you're going to put this burden on EPA, it provides funding to carry out the responsibilities under the new law.

132
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:51,820
So I'm going to switch gears here and do a little of a contrast and pull in the European Union here in a minute in this regard.

133
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:58,930
But, you know, basically the set up here in the US is the burden and the requirement is on EPA

134
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:04,450
to do this evaluation and to identify what might be toxic in the environment.

135
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:07,690
Lucky might be causing adverse impacts on health.

136
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:14,710
So to contrast that a little bit, we'll talk about Rich here for a moment.

137
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:22,750
RE stands for Regulation on Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals.

138
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:29,440
So this is the European Union approach to regulating chemicals in the environment.

139
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:34,570
So think that can be protective of both human health and the environment.

140
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:48,450
It was implemented back in 2007. And what it does is it puts the onus on manufacturers, the organizations, the companies,

141
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:54,270
whatever it might be that are producing, distributing and utilizing those chemicals.

142
00:16:55,740 --> 00:17:02,670
So it requires them to generate registration documents that describe the hazards

143
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:06,750
of the chemicals that they generate and encounter as part of their business.

144
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:19,950
So any companies within the EU or in addition importing or exporting chemicals to or from the EU must comply with these REACH regulations.

145
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:28,440
So because we have, you know, this large global market, even though even that reaches a play within the EU or by the EU,

146
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:33,270
its effect is felt in other countries outside of the European Union.

147
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:44,730
It promotes alternative methods for hazard assessment of substances and again to promote safe use of the chemicals throughout the supply chain,

148
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:50,980
reduce the risk of highly toxic chemicals, and also reduce the number of tests on animals.

149
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:59,760
But again, kind of the takeaway message here is that it's it's putting the burden on companies to be responsible for the safety of these chemicals,

150
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:06,660
which is a little bit different, quite a bit different than the structure, the regulatory framework here within the US.

151
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:16,230
All right. So moving on to food safety systems. So there are a couple of different a few different agencies in the US responsible for food safety.

152
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:20,219
We've got the Food and Drug Administration, which has been around for quite a long time,

153
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:27,120
back to 1930, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, as well as the US EPA.

154
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:32,370
Uh, a big part of this is around processing of food.

155
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:39,840
So a lot of microbiological hazard concerns. Uh, and this actually ends up being, which we talk about implementation.

156
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:49,580
This occurs at a primarily a very local level. So local environmental health departments that are overseeing, testing, inspecting and enforcing.

157
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:57,870
So specific to the EPA, its mission is to assure the safety, efficacy and the security of drugs,

158
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:05,730
biological products and medical devices, our nation's food supply, cosmetics, as well as products that emit radiation.

159
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:16,330
Related to this is the Food Quality Protection Act that was legislated in 1996,

160
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:22,030
which includes health based standards for pesticide residues found in food.

161
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:34,329
And it uses something called a reasonable certainty of no harm as a general safety standard and eliminated some long standing problems that were posed

162
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:41,140
by multiple standards for pesticides in raw and processed foods prior to 1996

163
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:47,780
and requires consideration of all importantly known occupational sources.

164
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:54,010
Right. So this is basically everything that someone might encounter in their daily life.

165
00:19:55,390 --> 00:20:04,510
Sources of exposure. So drinking water, exposure to other pesticides with a common mechanism of toxicity when setting these tolerances.

166
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:11,770
And again, it involves this is another example that involves some complex predictive modeling of exposure.

167
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:25,520
This act also included or includes special provisions for infants and children, recognizing that infants and children are especially vulnerable.

168
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:37,970
So an additional safety factor of up to ten fold, if necessary, can be applied to account for any uncertainty in data relative to children.

169
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:43,940
It also specifically addresses endocrine disruptors, right?

170
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:52,160
So incorporating provisions for endocrine testing and provides new authority to require that chemical manufacturers provide data on their products,

171
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:58,390
including data on any potential endocrine effects. All right.

172
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:05,080
And that was like a little bit of a quick, quick summary overview as broad and as quickly as possible.

173
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:12,460
Any questions? I kind of like this overall regulatory structure of agencies, mostly here in the U.S.

174
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:21,420
Yes. For food safety features in the burden of proof more so on the human factors when compared to many chemicals.

175
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:25,770
A bit more so. Yes, that's. And that's a great observations. Um.

176
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:34,110
Yeah. And, you know, for the most. Not for all of these, but for a lot of cases, the effects can be quite acute.

177
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:39,150
Right. So it might be easier to detect, to and to track.

178
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,140
Whereas with a lot of the chemical exposures that are out there,

179
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:49,380
they tend to be a lower level chronic, you know, a longer time frame for health effects.

180
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:51,540
Yeah, that's a good observation.

181
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:57,940
And then I guess a follow up question to that is, I know, like the food safety standards have like, um, like a recall.

182
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:02,370
Is there anything like, similar to that for, uh, chemicals or pesticide?

183
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:13,500
Not so much, no, not. Not in the same framework with, you know, that that response, uh, in terms of time response.

184
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:19,470
Hmm. Um, it's a long and laborious process to actually bring in a chemical.

185
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:31,880
Thank you. Yeah, of course. And the other questions. Those are great. Does the FDA put a magnifying glass on imported foods at all?

186
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:42,870
So there is the USDA as well for imported agricultural products and so forth.

187
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:52,879
And there is, yes, inspection of food products, both, you know, meats, eggs, produce,

188
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:57,050
this type of thing as well as, you know, kind of processed and packaged foods.

189
00:22:57,550 --> 00:23:00,800
Just following that for us.

190
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:06,780
I would imagine so, yes. You're concerned about it right there?

191
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:11,870
Yeah. It's going to take a lot of for sure.

192
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:15,720
Yeah. Yeah, we do. I mean, it's a good example, actually, right.

193
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:20,330
Uh, uh, especially for packaged foods, even non packaged foods.

194
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:24,410
Right. Like, like each year the sticker on your banana, uh, to see where that came from.

195
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:29,660
A lot of foods that come from outside of the U.S. can taste everything.

196
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:37,850
Absolutely not. Yeah. Not in real time, at least. Right. Uh, you briefly touched on European regulation.

197
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:41,180
Yeah, well. Well, not actually. Okay.

198
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:48,920
Why even you address regulations in countries like in Asia or Africans?

199
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:52,310
We do import products from black Asian. We do. We do. Yeah.

200
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:59,450
And it's a great question. Uh, it would, it would require a couple extra class periods and maybe even a whole class,

201
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:05,900
which there are, uh, that you can take if you're interested specifically in food and food systems.

202
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:14,990
Um, I could have chosen, uh, like for this, I'm going to start to dove into kind of an applied example here with the Clean Air Act.

203
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:19,700
I could have chosen, uh, you know, food safety as well.

204
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:28,250
And, but I didn't, um, also, you could have asked the question not just for food safety, right?

205
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:33,050
For any of these things, you know, would we would could we or should we be talking about,

206
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,340
uh, on a global scale in other countries, in an international setting?

207
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:46,370
Uh, what's the deal with, with air quality, for example, I'll finish the lecture trying to do that very briefly just to acknowledge it.

208
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:52,879
Uh, I mean, this is, it's a good opportunity to make a point for most of these cases.

209
00:24:52,880 --> 00:25:00,770
We're talking about water quality, uh, air quality, food safety really.

210
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:10,879
For the most part, we have the safest levels and the most protection here in the U.S. compared to most other countries in the world.

211
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:17,000
So in that sense, it's a luxury. On the other hand, we still have big challenges, right?

212
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:24,649
So whatever you take away here from the discussions around kind of a US centric look on on these regulations

213
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:30,620
and standards and the framework and the process keep in the back of your mind that it tends to be,

214
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:38,210
um, a little bit worse too, a lot worse as you go to, to, to middle and low income countries.

215
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:44,690
The great, great question and good point. And sorry, I don't have a better answer for you.

216
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:52,910
So actually, let me let me start with this slide here. All right. So we're going to focus in on our around air quality and the Clean Air Act.

217
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:58,670
A little bit of an in-flight discussion here. So there's a long history of air pollution control and regulation.

218
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:11,210
Here we go. We're going international already going back just 1272, King Edward, the first of England, banned the use of coal to clear smoky skies.

219
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:16,040
And he stated, Be a no to all within the sound of my voice.

220
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:21,680
Whoever shall be found guilty of burning coal shall suffered the loss of his head.

221
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:22,720
Okay.

222
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:29,210
I don't think we are expecting, you know, President Biden to come out and make some sort of statement like this any time soon, which is a good thing.

223
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:36,620
But in reality, yes, there has there has been a long history, more so in the modern era.

224
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:44,240
And again, coming back to the U.S., we have this timeline of 1970 with amendments through 1990 of the Clean Air Act.

225
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:48,680
Air quality in this country, we still have real issues.

226
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:52,250
We're going to look at some data to kind of address what our issues are.

227
00:26:53,420 --> 00:27:00,049
But going back in time, not too far back, going back 50 years or so, especially beyond that,

228
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:05,220
we have really for air quality, outdoor and outdoor conditions here in the U.S.

229
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:15,950
Here's some images from Detroit, a huge manufacturing example, New York City, a huge motor vehicle impact example.

230
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,610
So Pittsburgh, iron and steel production.

231
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:22,610
Right. Um, pretty much unregulated.

232
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:30,980
No emissions control just spewed forth right through through emissions, whether it's coming from cars or smokestacks.

233
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:38,060
So along comes the Clean Air Act, right, in 1970 and then its subsequent amendments.

234
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:47,600
There are actually two different types of air quality standards, one that's considered primary, and this is to protect people.

235
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:52,670
Right? Another one that's considered secondary to protect public welfare.

236
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:57,470
So things like visibility or the integrity of structural materials.

237
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:10,010
So kind of the chronology of these criteria, air pollutants, which we have six currently started with carbon monoxide gas, nitrogen dioxide.

238
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:14,840
Sulfur dioxide. Total suspended particulate in the air.

239
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:25,280
Hydrocarbons, interestingly. And then a category called accidents led was added to this list in 1976.

240
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:36,800
Once once we became wise to the our unwise decision up to that point to purposely add lead to gasoline and thereby distribute it all over the country.

241
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:47,660
We learned a little bit from a research perspective that it wasn't so much accidents causing these health effects, but it was specifically ozone gas.

242
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:49,159
That's one of those accidents.

243
00:28:49,160 --> 00:29:01,490
So for that reason, the next the national been for air quality standards focused in on ozone specifically hydrocarbons was removed in 1983.

244
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:10,640
And again, this is well before we had wrapped our heads around, uh, you know, the concept of greenhouse gas emissions and global warming.

245
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:16,370
But it was, it was too hard to regulate because there were so many. So EPA basically gave up on it.

246
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:22,460
The total suspended particulates was changed to PM10.

247
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:30,590
The ten refers to the size of the particles. So this means particles ten microns or less in aerodynamic diameter.

248
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:38,300
And it was through research that informed us that it's really only particles, ten microns or less, that are able to get into our airways.

249
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:45,170
Particles greater than ten are basically filtered out through our nose hairs or mucous membranes and so forth,

250
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:49,220
and they're removed before they're able to get further into our airways.

251
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,400
A separate so in addition to PM10, there was a PM 2.5 standards.

252
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:57,559
It was added a bit later in 1997.

253
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:03,860
And this again was through research informing us that it's an independent effect from

254
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:08,600
particles that are two and a half microns compared to those of about ten or less.

255
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:18,140
Along the way here, recognizing motor vehicles caused a huge amount of emission.

256
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:26,930
There were catalytic converters that were required to be put on to cars first with a single band catalyst and a dual band catalyst,

257
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:29,300
and then a three way catalyst.

258
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:43,160
By 1979, it was able to convert the carbon monoxide, the hydrocarbons, and then nitrogen oxides in a single bed to CO2 and nitrogen gas.

259
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:53,570
This is hitting on that public welfare component to the secondary index standard.

260
00:30:54,350 --> 00:31:00,500
So in addition to protecting us from the from an inhalation effect of pollutants,

261
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:08,420
there's also something called prevention of significant deterioration in areas of different levels of impact.

262
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:18,019
Some pristine areas where, hey, if there's a national park like the Clean Air Act actually protects somebody from proposing

263
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:23,030
or trying to build a big manufacturing facility in the middle of the Grand Canyon.

264
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:28,370
It's protected by the Clean Air Act as this pristine area.

265
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:36,770
Here is an example of visibility, right. These are pictures from Great Smoky Mountains National Park.

266
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:46,280
And so there are special protections well beyond all of the other lands of the country when it comes to these pristine areas.

267
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:50,540
Why are they concerned? Is this a trick question?

268
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:56,750
They look kind of smoky on occasion. Yeah.

269
00:31:57,890 --> 00:32:02,000
Yeah. I mean, the we could look at maps actually was let's put a map out.

270
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:08,090
Yes. How convenient. Don't look at the bullets or any of the other information, but just look at the map.

271
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:17,750
You know, historically, it's been the eastern half of the U.S. that has burned most of the fossil fuels, most of the coal.

272
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:22,370
Right. Huge population centers with automobiles.

273
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:28,360
And so, yeah, that Smoky Mountains National Park, which my geography stinks, but it's like it's around there.

274
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:35,600
So it's just kind of surrounded by, you know, large urban centers, lots of manufacturing,

275
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:41,750
lots of coal combustion and so on for a long time has been impacted by pollutants from these emissions.

276
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:49,070
Okay. So the point of this map is actually moving on to another topic, the six city study.

277
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:54,290
So one of the important things about the Clean Air Act that it did was it funded research.

278
00:32:55,250 --> 00:33:02,930
So academic researchers were thrilled when the Clean Air Act was legislated because it allocated a lot of money.

279
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:08,629
The EPA was able to give out to fund research projects, and this was 1 to 6 cities study,

280
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:13,460
which was led by Harvard University during the 1970s, in the 1980s.

281
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:19,340
And the six cities are represented by these six states.

282
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:27,110
And the study found a strong, positive correlation between levels of air pollution and mortality.

283
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:34,880
And just the results from this study led to a direct revision of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards by EPA.

284
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:41,720
It found that individuals in highly polluted areas, for example, I hope there's a plot in the next slide.

285
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:48,680
For example, in Steubenville, Ohio, lived on average, four years less than those who lived in less polluted areas.

286
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,620
And this is looking at a risk ratio for death.

287
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:59,709
This is Portage, Wisconsin, where we have we're looking at fine particles.

288
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:09,790
So this is the PM 2.5 at an average level of about, let's see, 11 micrograms per cubic meter, but the risk ratio of death rate about one.

289
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:13,210
And then when we look at Steubenville, Ohio,

290
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:20,350
where the PPM level is approaching 30 micrograms per cubic meter, so quite a bit larger, but a bit higher.

291
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:25,420
And that risk ratio was up here around 1.3. So very significant.

292
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:28,870
And you can just you know, it doesn't take a fancy statistics.

293
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:33,879
It just takes an eyeball test and you have to see this linear result.

294
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:41,110
And you're right that with people in increased living in areas with increased exposure to these particles,

295
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:48,850
that increased risk of death is increasing along with it.

296
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:50,559
Yeah, just a quick comment.

297
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:56,780
Just because you remember last class when we talked about the Hopi studies, this was an example of the ecological study for.

298
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:03,420
Population. Yeah, absolutely.

299
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:10,020
So this is not this study was not folks wearing personal monitors or something or collecting data on themselves,

300
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:15,839
these really central monitors or maybe multiple monitors within a metropolitan

301
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:20,970
area that served as surrogate assessments of exposure to these particles.

302
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:28,480
And actually we're not going to get into it, but it's occurring to me that it's worth mentioning.

303
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:32,770
Uh, this is the clock in chemical hazards.

304
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:36,130
Right. And I'm using this example of an air pollution.

305
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:41,350
I could have been better off by choosing a pollutant like ozone. It's truly a chemical.

306
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:48,010
PPM kind of walks this line. It can be both physical hazard.

307
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:54,610
It's actually a particle that can get into our lungs and physically irritate our long linings.

308
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:59,230
But particles are made up of many, many, many chemicals.

309
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:08,170
And interestingly, we haven't learned enough about it to come up with regulations of chemical components of particles.

310
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:12,910
It's simply left as regulation on a mass basis of the EPA.

311
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:22,150
So when we're looking at this, it's it's yet to be determined, really how much and what types of specific chemicals are causing this effect.

312
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:28,510
It's pretty widely acknowledged by the community that it's not simply just a physical irritation of the particles.

313
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:31,149
All right.

314
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:42,610
So now I'm going to illustrate here begin to illustrate why this can be pretty messy when it comes to implementing new legislation and new policy.

315
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:51,160
So the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act did a number of things that authorized programs around asset deposition control.

316
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:59,920
We talked about these 189 hazardous air pollutants, establish some new permit program requirements, um,

317
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:06,100
some new provisions around the nacs and expanded and modified some of the enforcement authorities.

318
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:10,330
All right. So in structure, this is what it looks like.

319
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:14,150
It's these titles within the legislative document.

320
00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:22,690
So there are 11 of them. The first one is that for her on this page, uh, there are we're not going to go through them all.

321
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:30,910
There's another seven here if we just zoom in on Title one.

322
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:42,790
So one, the first of the 11 titles, which is around air pollution prevention and control, there are four different parts per day addresses,

323
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:51,070
air quality, the mission limitations, part B, ozone protection, part C, that prevention of significant deterioration.

324
00:37:51,700 --> 00:38:00,790
And then part D a different plan requirements for non attainment areas, non attainment meaning areas that aren't meeting the air quality standards.

325
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:05,020
Right. Okay. So now so this is just title one.

326
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:14,230
We have these four parts. If we just look at part A, we've got Section 101 through 115.

327
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:19,930
Right? So you can do some mental math pretty quickly. This isn't like a 20 page document.

328
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:29,740
And back in the 1970s and 1980s, our federal Congress was a bit more functional, I guess, to say the least.

329
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:38,650
You all know it's current status and its ability to pass kind of a logical and rational legislation.

330
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:45,639
So this is one of the reasons why, you know, and it's really it's a whole nother class to dig into why it's the case.

331
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:52,150
But we got into about the early 1990s and it's been like pulling teeth to try to make

332
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:59,380
progress and to improve regulations and standards and even legislate new initiatives.

333
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,170
All right. So how about some good news? Let's let's look at some data.

334
00:39:07,370 --> 00:39:11,780
We had this Clean Air Act. We had these amendments in the end.

335
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:15,080
Is it a good thing? The answer is pretty much yes.

336
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:21,350
So here's some data trends that led going back to 1980.

337
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:23,179
This was actually an easy one, right?

338
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:35,990
It was very high, dropped down considerably through the 1980s into the 1990s as and has been maintained a quite low level on average during the 2000.

339
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:42,500
This was simply banning LED additives in gasoline that cars use right when it used to

340
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:50,540
be added to help the combustion efficiency for the motor vehicle engine removing lead.

341
00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:53,150
So very dramatic decreases.

342
00:39:53,540 --> 00:40:01,369
So in this case, yes, the regulation and speed standards put into place bromide were highly effective for something like that.

343
00:40:01,370 --> 00:40:06,100
So too sulfur dioxide. And it's also been pretty effective.

344
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:12,410
You can see this very consistent and dramatic reduction over the last three or four decades.

345
00:40:13,970 --> 00:40:20,450
So to gas, it was the sulfur dioxide is primarily emitted from coal combustion.

346
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:26,420
It's not because anyone's adding sulfur to the process or utilizing as part of some sort of manufacturing.

347
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:33,260
It's just that when coal is mined out of the earth, it's geologically naturally enriched with sulfur.

348
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:37,580
So when the coal was burned as a source of energy to generate electricity,

349
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:44,510
much of that sulfur liberated when it's burned at a high temperature as a result of a high temperature combustion process.

350
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:53,030
It's in the form of sulfur dioxide gas that that sulfur dioxide gas that's downwind effects are contributing to acid rain.

351
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:58,430
The SO2 gas is able to be converted in the atmosphere to salt.

352
00:40:58,430 --> 00:41:06,220
The particles that are washed out, like in rain, also lead to acidity in the terrestrial and aquatic environments.

353
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:13,640
It also generates the particles before they're washed up that we can then inhale.

354
00:41:13,730 --> 00:41:17,240
It's got a secondary particulate actually in this case.

355
00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:21,140
And we'll talk about primary secondary particulates here in a minute.

356
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:29,059
Ozone gas is a tough one. It has decreased, but it's not nearly to the same extent.

357
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:39,350
Right. That we got so to has and certainly not the way the primary reason is that ozone isn't emitted from any of these sources.

358
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:45,440
There's no ozone emitted from smokestacks. There's no ozone emitted from car tailpipes.

359
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:54,259
Ozone is formed in the atmosphere through chemical reactions that take place downwind due to emissions from

360
00:41:54,260 --> 00:42:03,320
other precursors like nitrogen oxide gases and volatile organic compounds that in the presence of sunlight.

361
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:08,240
It's actually a photochemical reaction forms ozone.

362
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,800
So because of this it makes it a bit tougher to regulate.

363
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:22,100
The PM 2.5 has a little bit in the middle. There is also a decrease over time, but it's also not as dramatic.

364
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:36,290
We have made headway, for example, by just a decrease in SO2, by putting control technology on smokestacks, scrubbers and so forth.

365
00:42:37,490 --> 00:42:46,069
So primary emitted particles there are much less compared to when they're used to be going back to,

366
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:50,090
in this case, 2000, because is when the PM 2.5 seizure was put into place.

367
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:56,329
But there's also that secondary component. So PM 2.5 can be directly emitted.

368
00:42:56,330 --> 00:43:03,889
And it is, but it also can be formed through atmospheric, physical, chemical dynamics in the atmosphere.

369
00:43:03,890 --> 00:43:09,230
And so it also makes it a bit tougher to have an effect from the regulation.

370
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:17,510
Highlighting just a couple of follow up studies. This is one that was focused on that acid rain component.

371
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:23,890
I just highlighted some things here from from an article, quotes by author's coauthors.

372
00:43:23,930 --> 00:43:30,500
We're seeing regulations on emission sources having direct and positive impact to reduce pollutants and rain.

373
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:38,330
The researchers largely attribute the decrease to the amendments of the Clean Air Act in 1990, regulating emissions of sulfur dioxide in 92.

374
00:43:38,330 --> 00:43:44,930
That said, uh, we want to make sure that the regulations put into place are effective if they do what they're designed to do.

375
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:48,860
That's why we here we spend a lot of money to promulgate regulations.

376
00:43:49,070 --> 00:43:56,680
It's expensive to do this and think that imparts a lot of pressure on the economy to have these regulations and standards in place.

377
00:43:56,690 --> 00:44:00,500
There's a lot of concern about their impact on industry is the quote this.

378
00:44:00,530 --> 00:44:04,450
Study shows clear, significant evidence of the direct impact of the regulation.

379
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:09,880
Here's some data to go along with that study back in 1985.

380
00:44:10,570 --> 00:44:17,440
This was sulfate, iron concentrations and rainfall in the Midwest and into the northeast part of the U.S.

381
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:24,160
because of those 1990 amendments that reduced sulfur dioxide emissions to a large extent.

382
00:44:25,090 --> 00:44:29,170
We then had much, much lower sulfate ion concentrations in rainfall.

383
00:44:29,650 --> 00:44:38,470
By the time we got to 2008. Looking at another study, this can kind of be viewed as a follow up to the six city study.

384
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:44,229
It's not actually called the 51 study study, but there were 51 studies involved.

385
00:44:44,230 --> 00:44:52,150
So much larger in scope and in scale than that original study had some of the same coauthors,

386
00:44:53,110 --> 00:44:58,840
some of the same cities actually, that from the original study that were included in this one.

387
00:44:59,650 --> 00:45:03,470
So this the previous study was looking at acid rain.

388
00:45:03,490 --> 00:45:08,740
This one is looking at particles and exposure through the inhalation route.

389
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:19,030
The study found that average life expectancy across the U.S. increased nearly three years over recent decades,

390
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:28,780
and approximately five months of that increase came thanks to simply cleaner air, better air quality, lower levels of these pollutants.

391
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:34,720
And again, another statement, we find we're getting a substantial return on our investments in improving our air quality.

392
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:40,180
Not only are we getting cleaner air that improves our environment, but it's improving our public health.

393
00:45:41,230 --> 00:45:50,110
And then yet here's just a quick map of all of those 51 cities, much more representative of the broader population of the country.

394
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:56,240
And then this one is maybe a little bit of propaganda.

395
00:45:56,250 --> 00:46:01,440
This is an EPA plot, but again, it's just kind of countering the narrative.

396
00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:08,670
So every step of the way, when it comes to standards and regulations within the environment in the U.S.,

397
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:22,110
there is some sort of industry group that is concerned and paints a picture of if we burden the economy with these standards and regulations,

398
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:28,890
it will cost jobs, right? It will decrease our economic output and so forth.

399
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:37,790
So this graph is showing some time trends going back over the last few decades, starting at the bottom here.

400
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:46,170
These are aggregated emissions of those six criteria pollutants and we see them going down right on average over time.

401
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:51,360
Our population over that time in the US, that kind of green line here has increased.

402
00:46:52,520 --> 00:47:03,390
Uh, we've had a bit more demand for energy which has resulted in increased, but then more recently some decrease in CO2 emissions.

403
00:47:04,770 --> 00:47:10,440
All while we're not driving cars less, we're driving them more as a population.

404
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:16,230
So vehicle miles traveled has increased dramatically compared to 1970.

405
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:20,280
But all along this is our gross domestic product.

406
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:29,070
And so as a country, even though we have these, you know, kind of the burden of standards and regulations on our economy,

407
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:35,280
the economy has still remained strong and has grown over that 3 to 4 decade time period.

408
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:38,260
All right.

409
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:54,219
Uh, the less good news is that, uh, we have about a third of our population in the US that lives in a county where at least one of the air quality,

410
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:59,620
the National Ambient Air Quality Standards, is exceeded. So that that's still not so great, right?

411
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:10,450
One in three people lives in a county where air quality is poor for at least one of these six pollutants, they're primarily driven by ozone and PPM.

412
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:17,440
And then when you look at, you know that that's just simply exceedances above the standard.

413
00:48:17,830 --> 00:48:26,260
When you look at impact on health, it's actually flipped. PPM is the biggest driver and it's one of the reasons why I focused on it here in the class.

414
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:33,460
And it's not just within the U.S. If you look globally around the world, this global burden of disease statistics,

415
00:48:33,970 --> 00:48:43,510
it's anywhere between 6 to 8 million people, uh, each year that die prematurely just from PPM exposure.

416
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:50,469
To put that into perspective, as awful as the pandemic has been over the last couple of years, there are less.

417
00:48:50,470 --> 00:48:57,640
The rate of death due to COVID 19 is less than that due to PM 2.5 exposure.

418
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:07,390
So in that sense, we've been experiencing an annual pandemic of PM 2.5 for four decades now across the globe.

419
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:13,299
Question When you said there died prematurely, is that five, five months?

420
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:16,390
Is that by 20 years? Like, what does that number?

421
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:20,980
It varies from individual to individual, absolutely.

422
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:28,270
Okay. That's a that's a pretty tough statement to say prematurely when it could have just been a death type of thing.

423
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:31,890
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, much many of these are there.

424
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:37,720
John talked about epidemiological analyzes, right. Where you can control for many, many different factors.

425
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:46,330
And so this is how those studies are able to kind of parse out all of the other contributors to what might be causing a heart attack, for example.

426
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:51,670
Right. And can identify which fraction of that is being caused by.

427
00:49:51,760 --> 00:50:01,059
It's very different issue. Gotcha. Yeah. Yeah. So it's much more of a it's statistically robust, but it's a it's a statistical result.

428
00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:07,150
It's not someone kind of making a call, you know, what do I consider very immature?

429
00:50:09,170 --> 00:50:14,530
Any other questions? Comments? All right.

430
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:22,060
I want to finish up on this one, because our country is maybe not unique, but we definitely lead the way.

431
00:50:22,870 --> 00:50:32,290
This is pretty much how standards and regulations come to a head, and decisions are ultimately made within the U.S.

432
00:50:33,010 --> 00:50:39,460
The EPA issues a standard or maybe the updated standard or regulation.

433
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:49,600
And there is always, whether it's a health advocacy group that says the EPA didn't go far enough or an industry group that says,

434
00:50:50,050 --> 00:50:56,800
whoa, whoa, EPA went too far. Somebody brings a lawsuit against EPA.

435
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:08,920
And so it ends up being through a court that ends up deciding what standard, what enforcement capability the EPA is actually allowed to do.

436
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:16,800
This doesn't happen in many other countries and it's by far happens the most here in the US.

437
00:51:16,810 --> 00:51:18,430
But it's a very interesting dynamic.

438
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:27,040
And again, that's that's another one of my illustrations for how, you know, we have this problem posed to us science.

439
00:51:27,310 --> 00:51:35,560
You know, conducting good science can really lead us to a very rationally effective and safe standard to be protective of public health.

440
00:51:36,190 --> 00:51:40,690
We talked about Congress being somewhat less efficient at the federal level.

441
00:51:41,770 --> 00:51:47,070
And then, you know, the ability for lawsuits to be brought and having things being decided by a court.

442
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:56,620
Right. So there's all of this reality down here that actually impacts our ability to to establish and then to even have state standards.

443
00:51:58,270 --> 00:52:01,630
All right. Enough of me in the.

444
00:52:01,810 --> 00:52:05,560
Yeah, we don't have time. I have this YouTube video that I want you to watch.

445
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:13,480
It is, I think, 17 minutes long. We'll watch it together. I'll play it here on the screen to give a little bit of background.

446
00:52:14,230 --> 00:52:20,560
It is telling the history of air quality in this country, but where it was kind of the worst in time.

447
00:52:20,590 --> 00:52:25,530
This is focusing on southern California going back to the early 1940s.

448
00:52:26,050 --> 00:52:31,300
The video, I think, was produced in maybe 2008. So it doesn't come up to it completely present.

449
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:32,110
But that's not the point.

450
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:40,210
The point is to look at kind of the historical dynamics of it, but it does a pretty good job of highlighting the struggles of policy.

451
00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:45,760
First, it was research. We didn't really understand the air quality and how it was impacting health.

452
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:49,390
That was a big hurdle. And then it took a lot of cooperation.

453
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:58,840
It wasn't government agencies and citizenry and companies off against each other.

454
00:52:59,110 --> 00:53:02,530
It was them working together to actually make make headway.

455
00:53:03,370 --> 00:53:09,250
And then we'll back out with a little bit of time to discuss some of these things once it's done.

456
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:13,780
See if I can get this going. I should have done a test run before we started the class.

457
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:48,380
Here we go. If there's blaring and it's not my fault.

458
00:53:50,650 --> 00:53:58,450
Should. But yes.

459
00:54:05,790 --> 00:54:11,900
This is part of what's going on right now.

460
00:54:11,990 --> 00:54:20,270
Just because you were forced. I mean, make this louder.

461
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:30,130
You. The audio is poor and it's real recordings, but it gets better.

462
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:39,940
You hear that? If I dim the lights, he promised I'd fall asleep.

463
00:54:40,030 --> 00:54:45,190
1943. It was a growing problem and still a mystery.

464
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:48,930
Everyone knew something had to be done quickly.

465
00:54:49,690 --> 00:54:53,980
The haze of smoke is getting worse. Burning eyes.

466
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:57,790
Silly little children out of California.

467
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:07,050
But what once more, what were the health effects? And how much was too much?

468
00:55:08,010 --> 00:55:10,470
Where did it come from? And how do you control it?

469
00:55:11,990 --> 00:55:18,320
The best scientists at Caltech, the University of California, at Stanford, we put doing what they discovered,

470
00:55:18,470 --> 00:55:26,990
set the stage for pioneering air pollution for over the next five decades, making California a world leader in the fight against smog.

471
00:55:28,430 --> 00:55:32,450
Scientists simulated the atmosphere in chambers until the answers came.

472
00:55:33,620 --> 00:55:38,540
They discovered a small it was mainly ozone, gas and very small particulate matter.

473
00:55:39,830 --> 00:55:46,550
It came from the burning of fuels and the emission of hydrocarbon vapors cooked under stable air in warm sunlight.

474
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:57,150
It was the recipe for a toxic soup. Whether or not this city can.

475
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:07,000
Even those. Remember, California was warm and dry very much I here.

476
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:11,380
Few were suspected that it came from thousands of different air pollution sources.

477
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:19,100
No one imagined that it would take the next 50 years of science and politics to make substantial progress.

478
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:27,850
Controlling smog. It would take concerned citizens working with local and state government to pass laws that protect the public from air pollution.

479
00:56:28,270 --> 00:56:36,460
And it would take academia and industry working together to create innovative engineering solutions to reduce air pollution emissions.

480
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:44,160
In all the years, smoke from factories was wrongly perceived as the main ingredient of smog.

481
00:56:45,270 --> 00:56:53,610
The city of Los Angeles was first to jump into the fight. During World War two years adopting smog regulations, they had little effect on the smog.

482
00:56:54,540 --> 00:57:01,860
At the same time, officials realized that it would take more than one city standing alone to reduce north through out of that area.

483
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:09,720
They discovered that the chemistry of air pollution is complex and that it knows no geographic boundaries.

484
00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:16,440
Smog forming emissions from one can frequently find their way to a neighboring downwind.

485
00:57:17,970 --> 00:57:27,390
The public demanded that more be done. The California legislature passed a law in 1947 allowing counties to regulate local sources of air pollution.

486
00:57:28,590 --> 00:57:32,160
That year, the Los Angeles Air Pollution Control District was formed.

487
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:38,490
Followed later by the Bay Area Air Pollution Control District and other Southern California governments.

488
00:57:40,490 --> 00:57:45,560
Mayor was deeply concerned. It was a pretty small footprint.

489
00:57:45,980 --> 00:57:55,420
This is the time that I've already I've ordered the police department to cooperate with the Air Pollution Control Board and every man.

490
00:57:58,130 --> 00:58:12,190
Very dramatic, very much. The industry started their cleanup with large industrial sources of air pollution,

491
00:58:12,190 --> 00:58:17,590
emissions burning landfills, refineries, power plants and factories.

492
00:58:18,610 --> 00:58:22,960
Later, regulations control the emissions from thousands of smaller industrial sources,

493
00:58:23,470 --> 00:58:29,440
paint shops, lighting operations, gasoline stations, borders and incinerators.

494
00:58:30,430 --> 00:58:36,010
Emissions from these sources, taken together, added up to a major portion of a small problem.

495
00:58:37,690 --> 00:58:44,530
Emission controls have to be fairly applied to all kinds of air pollution sources and be cost effective.

496
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:51,880
As research progressed and California grew, a major culprit came into clearer focus.

497
00:58:52,660 --> 00:58:58,300
The automobile just about everyone on the car and no one wanted it to be true.

498
00:58:59,020 --> 00:59:04,720
But cars and trucks were the blame for much of the smog now.

499
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:08,350
Everyone would make a more personal sacrifice for clean air.

500
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:15,860
The legislature also mandated motor vehicle emission standards for the first time, putting a limit on smog falling gases.

501
00:59:15,980 --> 00:59:24,860
The passage of the bill by. A record was set today for the longest duration of the hazardous year in the history of Los Angeles.

502
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:29,179
And the smog conditions will be just as bad tomorrow for everyone,

503
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:34,370
no matter how physically fit is being warned to stay inside and take it easy whenever possible.

504
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:42,630
Looking at air pollution districts with not enough support.

505
00:59:42,710 --> 00:59:45,440
Need a statewide effort to fight air pollution, wasn't it?

506
00:59:46,310 --> 00:59:56,450
In 1959, the legislature passed laws making California the first state to establish air quality standards based on the public health effects of smoke.

507
00:59:57,350 --> 01:00:06,410
This was a crucial first step in figuring out how much air pollution is too much to implement the statewide fight.

508
01:00:06,710 --> 01:00:12,050
The legislature created the Air Resources Board, or AARP, in 1967.

509
01:00:12,470 --> 01:00:15,920
Governor Ronald Reagan signed a law from Carol Air Resources Act.

510
01:00:16,850 --> 01:00:23,000
The board was given the job of controlling air pollution from cars, trucks and other local sources of air pollution.

511
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:28,790
RB was also directed to coordinate the efforts of the local air quality districts.

512
01:00:30,050 --> 01:00:36,710
The federal government issued a leaf that allowed California to set its own stringent standards for air pollution control.

513
01:00:37,820 --> 01:00:42,800
Air being set to work, requiring auto manufacturers to build clean air line vehicles,

514
01:00:43,460 --> 01:00:48,350
less hydrocarbons, less oxides of nitrogen and less carbon monoxide.

515
01:00:49,940 --> 01:00:56,900
Industry the challenge. First, cars have to have positive crankcase ventilation valves later.

516
01:00:57,260 --> 01:01:01,249
Every car had to have a catalytic converter. They were recovering.

517
01:01:01,250 --> 01:01:05,930
Nozzles became mandatory at gas stations. A lot of gasoline was phased out.

518
01:01:06,710 --> 01:01:17,750
Low sulfur fuel, oil and diesel fuel were things. Then in 1969, they are being the first in the nation to set ambient air quality standards for ozone.

519
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:23,240
Oxides of nitrogen, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide and particulate matter.

520
01:01:24,230 --> 01:01:31,880
The first automobile nitrogen oxides or NOx standards in the nation, were adopted by AARP in 1971,

521
01:01:32,570 --> 01:01:36,890
ushering in a 40 year long effort to require ever lower emission standards.

522
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:43,580
But even as cars and industry bloomed, less smog levels declined only slightly.

523
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:54,920
Between 1950 and 1980. 13 million more people call California home than most of them drove cars or trucks, drove more.

524
01:01:55,130 --> 01:02:02,450
And they drove for. The downtown Los Angeles skyline was shrouded in smog again today.

525
01:02:02,810 --> 01:02:07,820
The commuters driving into the city saw it slowly emerge from a dense gray haze.

526
01:02:08,330 --> 01:02:14,240
Millions of people were coughing and wheezing their way through the worst October smog attack in almost a decade.

527
01:02:14,630 --> 01:02:19,190
All through the morning, the eyes have been removed on the instruments they keep on the officials waiting to

528
01:02:19,190 --> 01:02:23,330
see if the smog would rise high enough to trigger still another second stage of it.

529
01:02:23,750 --> 01:02:28,730
Finally, the answer came as the South Coast Air Quality Management District,

530
01:02:29,090 --> 01:02:34,450
the second stage episode of the House River Accident, has been deemed the maximum.

531
01:02:34,730 --> 01:02:42,530
The average contaminant concentration is .39 parts per million in the East San Gabriel Valley area.

532
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:48,710
Air quality planners and government agencies have no choice.

533
01:02:49,250 --> 01:02:55,100
They will have to design tougher rules to keep up with explosive population growth and more air pollution.

534
01:02:56,230 --> 01:03:02,860
The effort involved in drawing up the smog rules in the first place has been enormous task that has taken several years,

535
01:03:03,250 --> 01:03:11,080
and now it's obvious that the job of working to comply with those rules will be equally as large as before.

536
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:19,120
California led the nation and the world developing new strategies to reduce smog levels to protect public health.

537
01:03:19,510 --> 01:03:27,580
It was the only choice we had. I'm going to go out in the open air and I wish it wasn't so funny.

538
01:03:28,180 --> 01:03:32,200
Looks to me like the avocado messed up. We won't even be able to breathe from that.

539
01:03:33,470 --> 01:03:47,730
That was me. I didn't catch that. During the in the nineties, California cars became the world's cleanest running cars.

540
01:03:48,420 --> 01:03:52,050
Computers controlled the engines, fuel and exhaust systems.

541
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:55,560
Smog checks made sure the equipment worked.

542
01:03:57,950 --> 01:04:04,010
California skies began to clear the choppy, burning haze that once blighted Los Angeles.

543
01:04:04,710 --> 01:04:12,900
Began Zoom. Despite millions more people, cars, trucks and more industry, California air quality was getting better.

544
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:18,330
In 1993, RB required new standards for cleaner diesel fuel.

545
01:04:19,170 --> 01:04:27,810
This reduced particle emissions by 14 tonnes per day, sulfur dioxide by 80 tonnes per day, and NOx by 70 tonnes per day.

546
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:41,220
Later, cleaner burning gasoline was introduced. It was the air quality equivalent of eliminating the pollution from 3.5 million cars in 1995.

547
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:52,230
RB had reduced automobile NOx emissions by 58% compared to 1970 levels and reduced hydrocarbon emissions by 80% compared to 1970.

548
01:04:53,130 --> 01:05:00,480
From the 1970s to the eighties and nineties, smugglers in L.A. and the Bay Area continue their steady downward trend.

549
01:05:01,050 --> 01:05:04,920
Levels of ozone, carbon monoxide and NOx will reduce.

550
01:05:06,450 --> 01:05:09,570
The public have demanded that something be done about smog.

551
01:05:10,170 --> 01:05:12,030
It was clear the system was working.

552
01:05:12,510 --> 01:05:20,190
State and local government working with academia and industry, making measurable progress in the fight to protect public health.

553
01:05:22,010 --> 01:05:25,220
Into the nineties, the world for Clean Air continued.

554
01:05:26,060 --> 01:05:31,940
RB was first in the world to identify diesel particulate emissions as a toxic air contaminant,

555
01:05:32,510 --> 01:05:35,780
laying the groundwork for cleaner running trucks and equipment.

556
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:45,560
In 1998, RB also greatly reduced smog forming emissions and water pollution from outboard engines and personal watercraft.

557
01:05:46,610 --> 01:05:57,350
New rules in 1999 cut smog, forming emissions from over 2500 common consumer products from nail polish to glass cleaners in the same year.

558
01:05:57,620 --> 01:06:03,559
RB sponsored the newly created California Fuel Cell Partnership to help study and introduce

559
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:08,780
fuel cell vehicles as a real world alternative to conventional gasoline automobiles.

560
01:06:10,220 --> 01:06:14,270
Clean air progress was measured by the turn of the century.

561
01:06:14,540 --> 01:06:22,970
The total emissions of hydrocarbons and NOx from California vehicles was 200,000 tons per year, less than it was in 1990.

562
01:06:23,660 --> 01:06:31,100
And this despite a huge population driven increase of 40 billion miles per year in total vehicle miles driven.

563
01:06:32,270 --> 01:06:41,450
Air quality got even better. L.A. smugglers went from 148 in 1970 to none in the year 2000.

564
01:06:42,260 --> 01:06:45,710
Smugglers in the San Francisco Bay area disappeared completely.

565
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:52,280
But more work remained to address the impact of air pollution on California's children.

566
01:06:52,940 --> 01:06:59,299
RB initiated the Children's Environmental Health Protection Program in 2006.

567
01:06:59,300 --> 01:07:05,750
Communities were selected for study, and a pioneering research study firmly established that children's lung development,

568
01:07:06,020 --> 01:07:09,050
if damaged by long term exposure to air pollution.

569
01:07:11,090 --> 01:07:17,960
AARP approved a comprehensive plan to reduce harmful particle emissions from a wide range of diesel powered equipment.

570
01:07:19,310 --> 01:07:24,740
Part of the massive effort to reduce diesel pollution centered on goods moving to California.

571
01:07:25,660 --> 01:07:33,610
Working with the ports and local air quality management districts being helped develop the most comprehensive plan in US seaport history

572
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:41,650
to reduce diesel pollution from port related operations ranging from ship emissions to rail yard emissions to support equipment,

573
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:45,940
particle and smog forming. NOx emissions are being reduced.

574
01:07:47,410 --> 01:07:51,920
Furthering its forward looking stance may be adopted in 2004,

575
01:07:51,950 --> 01:07:58,420
the nation's first greenhouse gas rule to require automakers to sell cars with reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

576
01:07:58,510 --> 01:08:06,730
Starting in 2009. When Amy, 32, was passed in 2006, the California Global Warming Solutions Act,

577
01:08:07,180 --> 01:08:15,760
MRV became responsible for the world's first comprehensive program of regulatory and market mechanisms to achieve greenhouse gas reductions.

578
01:08:16,870 --> 01:08:22,630
To avert serious environmental consequences, greenhouse gas emissions must be reduced.

579
01:08:23,610 --> 01:08:28,930
Great deals, no matter where you order Kroger, pick up fresh or everyone.

580
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:37,140
Much has been accomplished over the last 40 years protecting public health while allowing for economic growth.

581
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:44,370
Now, scientists know that had we done nothing, the Los Angeles would be the worst in the world,

582
01:08:44,850 --> 01:08:49,350
with peak ozone levels at least four times higher than they are today.

583
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:56,550
Air pollution control programs by air and the local districts have reduced air

584
01:08:56,550 --> 01:09:01,350
pollution concentrations to a small fraction of what they were in the 1960s.

585
01:09:02,310 --> 01:09:06,810
Researchers estimate this effort has prevented thousands of premature deaths in

586
01:09:06,810 --> 01:09:13,620
California at a modest cost of just 10.1% of California's yearly gross domestic product.

587
01:09:15,220 --> 01:09:17,620
That had not been banned from gasoline.

588
01:09:18,250 --> 01:09:24,970
Scientists believe that the IQ of some people growing up in Los Angeles could have been reduced up to seven points.

589
01:09:26,590 --> 01:09:29,830
The air is much cleaner, but not clear enough.

590
01:09:30,670 --> 01:09:35,500
Today, automobiles are 99% cleaner than they did in the 1960s.

591
01:09:36,340 --> 01:09:40,030
Transportation must pollute less as population rises.

592
01:09:40,660 --> 01:09:50,890
And we know now that PM 2.5 for particles less than 2.5 microns in size are responsible for most air pollution related deaths.

593
01:09:51,550 --> 01:09:55,900
RB and local districts have adopted an aggressive control strategy.

594
01:09:56,710 --> 01:10:07,750
Today, PM 2.5 Pollution has been reduced to roughly half of what it was in the 1980s, but area 2.5 is still too high.

595
01:10:09,260 --> 01:10:14,650
Unhealthy levels of air pollution violating state and federal standards are still with us.

596
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:23,890
With more people driving even more cars, more trucks reaching clean air goals will require even more innovative solutions.

597
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:33,520
Zero pollution options such as electric and fuel cell vehicles will chart the future of personal transportation.

598
01:10:34,180 --> 01:10:39,520
But California will need more cutting edge technology to clear California's skies.

599
01:10:41,590 --> 01:10:47,710
Smart consumer choices, such as carpooling and alternative transportation will matter more than ever.

600
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:52,480
Local support for air quality programs will be crucial for success.

601
01:10:54,430 --> 01:11:03,490
Once again, California can take a pioneering lead watched around the world in the fight against air pollution and clean air.

602
01:11:04,210 --> 01:11:12,040
It's up to us. Very inspirational.

603
01:11:17,450 --> 01:11:24,950
All right. So, yeah, actually, this is actually worth noting. So this video was produced by the California Air Resources Board.

604
01:11:24,950 --> 01:11:30,410
Right. So this is within a state agency that has oversight of air pollution.

605
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:35,570
It's definitely helpful as a historical perspective.

606
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:41,150
I'm sure a little bit of their motivation to produce this was to kind of publicize their great work.

607
01:11:41,150 --> 01:11:46,040
Right, and make sure that the funding continues to come to the board to continue to do their great work.

608
01:11:46,940 --> 01:11:51,080
So a few things to unpack with the remaining time that we have.

609
01:11:53,500 --> 01:12:00,800
It's it's a really good example. Right. So California has led the US both on the negative side and on the positive side.

610
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:08,180
Negative side. Right. It kind of led air pollution and a lot of environmental contamination, but especially air pollution.

611
01:12:08,810 --> 01:12:12,090
But it also responded ahead of the federal level.

612
01:12:12,110 --> 01:12:16,880
Right. The video kind of pointed out some of that legislation at the state level for standards,

613
01:12:17,570 --> 01:12:25,220
for requirements like factories and motor vehicles, etc., that were ahead of those at the federal level.

614
01:12:26,030 --> 01:12:35,000
And this law, as I mentioned earlier, this has been the case for all different types of environmental contaminants, not just those in the air.

615
01:12:35,330 --> 01:12:39,260
In terms of California being a little bit ahead of the federal process.

616
01:12:39,710 --> 01:12:42,560
It also again illustrates the challenge.

617
01:12:42,980 --> 01:12:50,210
It took decades just to get a handle on just to have the science catch up with what the heck is air pollution,

618
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:55,130
what's it composed of and how is it causing problems on health?

619
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:08,780
Here's an opportunity to now to to leave the U.S. borders sticking with with air pollution this process right of economic growth.

620
01:13:09,230 --> 01:13:20,090
Um increase in life expectancy increased access to health care, increase in standard of living.

621
01:13:20,300 --> 01:13:26,270
Right has come at an environmental cost. So after all those things are retained, basically.

622
01:13:26,660 --> 01:13:33,650
Then it was time to address, uh, the, the environmental consequences of it and they were addressed relatively well.

623
01:13:33,980 --> 01:13:36,920
We still have issues. California does, the US does.

624
01:13:37,610 --> 01:13:44,150
Um, but we're doing a decent job if you're comparing to other middle and low income countries around the world.

625
01:13:45,770 --> 01:13:48,830
But this process continues to play out, right?

626
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:53,300
So there are developing economies that are basically following the same path.

627
01:13:53,960 --> 01:13:57,380
They're increasing their standard of living. Positive things come from it.

628
01:13:57,770 --> 01:14:07,280
Um, better quality of life, better access to health care, but also some pretty, pretty awful environmental consequences decades later.

629
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:13,910
Right. So it's just shifted in time compared to what took place in the US and not just the U.S. right now for air pollution.

630
01:14:13,910 --> 01:14:18,469
We could look at London as a as another really kind of infamous example going back

631
01:14:18,470 --> 01:14:23,690
to the forties and really awful air pollution and progress that was made there.

632
01:14:23,990 --> 01:14:27,140
So with that, I'm going to jump into a couple of slides here just to highlight.

633
01:14:27,650 --> 01:14:38,330
So these are much more recent days. This is 2003, 2014 inches Air China and the use of coal.

634
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:42,140
Right. That could actually yeah. Coal cause increased.

635
01:14:43,100 --> 01:14:50,060
But this is looking at cars. So less than 20 million cars and just look at that exponential increase.

636
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:55,909
It's crazy just imagery you know, that you need to look at data.

637
01:14:55,910 --> 01:14:59,720
Plus, this is the city of Shanghai over the course of 20 years.

638
01:15:00,260 --> 01:15:13,450
1990 at the top to 2010, rapid rate growth, population growth, economic growth, development, all resulting in good things, higher standard of living,

639
01:15:13,460 --> 01:15:20,570
quality of life, access to health care, all these things, but with some environmental consequences, including including air pollution.

640
01:15:20,810 --> 01:15:27,230
This one just amazes me, right? This is basically like the island of Manhattan that grew up in just 20 short years.

641
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:37,000
This is another Chinese city, Beijing. This and these are, you know, more present day images that look a lot like Los Angeles, right.

642
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:40,340
Going back decades ago or London decades ago.

643
01:15:40,670 --> 01:15:46,430
It's just kind of a shifted timeline. This is on a good air quality day.

644
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:50,960
The same camera shot is a hazardous air quality condition.

645
01:15:51,500 --> 01:15:57,260
And we don't need to focus just on China. We can. This is a huge issue in India as well.

646
01:15:57,680 --> 01:16:06,950
Um, much of Asia and now even Africa, a lot of areas that are in developing, emerging or emerged economies.

647
01:16:07,430 --> 01:16:15,080
But now with either growing or already growing kind of environmental consequences left to manage.

648
01:16:16,940 --> 01:16:21,830
We're going through this all from a from an air quality air pollution example.

649
01:16:21,860 --> 01:16:28,160
But we can back this out to some of those other topics we started with to talk about from a water quality perspective.

650
01:16:28,580 --> 01:16:34,190
We can talk about it from a food safety perspective. Just tap management of hazardous waste.

651
01:16:34,580 --> 01:16:43,069
Right. In so many other countries around the world that are struggling and are behind that timeline to what the US is,

652
01:16:43,070 --> 01:16:46,310
basically the process has already gone through here.

653
01:16:46,520 --> 01:16:50,030
So what are the options at the international level?

654
01:16:50,600 --> 01:17:01,490
Much of it is provided by the World Health Organization, which is the coordinating authority for health within the United Nations system.

655
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:14,840
And importantly, at the national level. Individual countries can implement and enforce standards right at the international level.

656
01:17:14,930 --> 01:17:23,090
That doesn't really exist. So the United Nations or through the W.H.O. is able to put together guidelines.

657
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:28,489
Right. Developing economies can't afford to fund an Environmental Protection Agency.

658
01:17:28,490 --> 01:17:34,430
Right. With all of the resources that perhaps exist now within the U.S.

659
01:17:35,300 --> 01:17:41,270
The good news is, is we do understand a lot of the science around these environmental contaminants and their impact on health.

660
01:17:41,630 --> 01:17:47,720
So the research isn't necessarily required. It's more the problem solving, end of things and implementation.

661
01:17:49,880 --> 01:18:00,440
So yeah, so when we look at, you know, many in this case Asian cities, we're looking going back to our PPM levels, very high average levels.

662
01:18:00,470 --> 01:18:08,300
Right. Compared to what the W.H.O. is setting as the standard to protect to be safe and protect public health.

663
01:18:09,140 --> 01:18:14,090
So instead of just throwing up hands, the W.H.O. sets these interim targets.

664
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:21,200
Right. Okay. Perhaps you can't get down to 15, but maybe you need to 70 and then to 50 and so forth.

665
01:18:22,130 --> 01:18:33,080
And as part of providing those guidelines gives really sound estimations of reductions in risk.

666
01:18:33,170 --> 01:18:43,610
So if you're able to achieve one of these interim targets quantitatively, you can expect this benefit and improved health of the population.

667
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:49,700
And I think that is the and and oh, my gosh, I left like 20 seconds with questions.

668
01:18:49,700 --> 01:18:53,630
Perfect. Sorry for the whirlwind tour.

669
01:18:53,870 --> 01:19:02,020
Hopefully you come away with some of the benefits, the positives, how much effort is involved, but also, you know,

670
01:19:02,030 --> 01:19:07,790
the challenges that are exist presently going forward with maintaining these and

671
