1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,430
Many of you still hate me. Okay, let's do teaching.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:10,980
All right, so everybody had a good Labor Day weekend.

3
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:14,380
I dog sat for the first time.

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:22,050
I don't know how anybody gets anything done with it, cause I tried grading for this class and the other class,

5
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:30,960
and it took me twice as long as it normally does because she would whine if I stop petting her.

6
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:36,420
So I don't know. Do you just, like, ignore that after some or like I don't leave the house?

7
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:40,260
You have to leave the house to, like, go somewhere and do my work. Okay.

8
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:47,470
My dogs are so distracting. And she she does have, like, a bed under my desk, so I guess I could leave her on her.

9
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:53,120
Oh, I see. Well, she was lying on the floor next to me, and I was like, How are we this attached?

10
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:58,530
It's only been like a few days, but she just, like, invited her, so she was very comfortable.

11
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:03,419
So like when it was time to go to sleep, I had I got a dog that for her nice memory foam,

12
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,680
but she just like hopped right on my bed and then just left there.

13
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,620
And then at one point in the night, we were like, face to face.

14
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:16,620
And then I think at like 2 a.m., she was like hovering over me because I sometimes I mumble in my sleep,

15
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:22,590
so I don't know if she was like, What's going on? But one of us slept 10 hours straight and the other did not.

16
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:32,670
I did not. So anyway, and then I mean, if it wasn't like her, like she was like, I'm going to test the water.

17
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:39,930
You know, we had a supervised day playdate before and then I've seen her like this is dating, you know, doctor, friend's wife.

18
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:46,830
Okay, he retired, but this is Dr. Friend's Bottles, Dog. But he's going on a trip next month, next year for two months.

19
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:50,370
So we're trying to get adjusted to me.

20
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:54,250
And then I hit my neighbor's car this morning, so. Okay.

21
00:01:54,270 --> 00:02:01,709
All kinds of things. But we're going to continue on just finishing a couple of slides from last week and

22
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:09,600
then we'll get into an overview of the emergency responses of the United States today.

23
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:14,040
Just a reminder, I'll send out a canvass announcement as well.

24
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:19,259
But Thursday we won't meet in this room, will be online exclusively.

25
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:25,020
So we have a guest lecture from Dr. BIDDINGER. The zoom link is within the canvas course.

26
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:31,860
So, you know, I put directions in the canvas announcement on on how to find that for any it for all of

27
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:38,530
you or is this your only class on Tuesday Casey I'll have to be here anyway on Thursday.

28
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:42,330
It's like, oh, okay. Oh, on Thursday. Okay, so you can be at home.

29
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:45,930
Okay. Okay. There you go. Okay. All right.

30
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:51,780
So continuing out. Oh, and then your homework. So you all did really well on your homework.

31
00:02:52,260 --> 00:03:01,830
Go you. I mean, I have a preference for APA citation, but you all cited stuff, so whatever for credit you should have.

32
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:08,880
If you look at your due dates, you should have like a quiz coming up soon and then homework two and so on.

33
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:16,020
Yeah. Okay. So last week where we left off,

34
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:25,379
we talked about how complex it is preventing the spread of infectious diseases and that when we refer to the environment itself,

35
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:29,700
it's not just like the physical environment that we think of the natural environment,

36
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:38,970
but it's also the built environment but the landscapes of like industry, travel, commerce, politics, war and conflict.

37
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:50,309
This all factors into how we prevent the spread of infectious diseases, but also preventing further global warming and slowing climate change.

38
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:54,240
This is a huge feat. A huge feat.

39
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:58,920
So climate change has reached, you know, its impacts.

40
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:08,370
And we're now seeing increasing heatwaves, droughts, habitat fragmentation, and it has negative implications for the spread of infectious diseases.

41
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:12,270
So as we've seen, like things that used to be like hundred year floods,

42
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:18,149
thousand year floods are basically happening more or less every year, every other year.

43
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:26,430
Now, I think right now between Maine to the Carolinas, along that stretch,

44
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:32,100
they are currently on a severe flood watch right now just because of the storms that's happening,

45
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:38,970
the extreme severe flooding that's happened recently in Mississippi in tandem with,

46
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:45,750
as we'll talk about later in the semester, environmental racism, the lack of upkeep for the infrastructure.

47
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:53,010
Not only are these people like having to deal with the actual flooding itself and destruction of the infrastructure,

48
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:59,100
but associated health issues to come with it, which will will get discussed more.

49
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:08,190
So here is just some examples of the direct effects of climate change on vectors.

50
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:12,780
And yes, so this is going that no flood does that.

51
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:19,530
So I know like female will make flood plains for like hundred years, 50 years, etc.

52
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:25,380
Does the like the flood becoming every other year change how they would like.

53
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:31,560
And like analyze for estimate, like what flood plains would be and things like that or.

54
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:34,950
That's a good question. I actually don't know.

55
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:40,770
I would hope the answer would be yes. But something tells me no.

56
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:49,250
Do you want to help me find out? I get for my internship sometimes with HUD's disaster recovery.

57
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:55,970
Okay. So they use FEMA's blood planes to determine in Puerto Rico where they can reconstruct a home and not.

58
00:05:56,450 --> 00:06:00,770
And so if that keeps happening, then it would be like we can never.

59
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:06,900
Right. You have to keep moving inland or higher up here.

60
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:10,150
And it's a small island. So. So.

61
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:17,410
Yeah, yeah, that's a good question. Something tells me FEMA's not doing enough to make that.

62
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:22,300
But we'll get to that in a little in like 20, 30 minutes.

63
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:32,260
So for the direct climate change effects in particular with vectors, so changes in distribution of the vectors in particular we talked about,

64
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:37,150
they're now at higher latitudes and higher altitudes than they previously were.

65
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:41,860
Effects on biology and their physiology. Physiology of their life cycle.

66
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:50,140
More successful rates of not only progeny being born, but success rates in becoming like adult vectors,

67
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:55,750
acceleration of pathogen development, and then again like the completion of the full breeding cycle.

68
00:06:56,140 --> 00:07:02,050
Now we also, because of changes in global wind patterns, have change migrations of certain vectors,

69
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:06,970
precipitation changes, the length and seasons that vectors can survive.

70
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:14,830
And then relative humidity has effects on vector lifespan as well, with higher humidity being more desirable.

71
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:21,040
So we talked about how to, you know, curb the growth of vectors.

72
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:27,459
So in particular, Stillwater is breeding grounds for mosquitoes, which can spread things like malaria,

73
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:31,960
yellow fever, chikungunya, Duckett, dengue, West Nile and Zika.

74
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:38,800
We talked about how the DE and reforestation can cause takes to be in places they normally aren't,

75
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:43,690
resulting in greater incidence of Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever.

76
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:50,140
I live in a very developed like HLA community in Superior Township where it's

77
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:54,040
like the kind of neighborhoods where people like we have to maintain our lawns,

78
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,880
which I really hate.

79
00:07:56,170 --> 00:08:03,880
I'd rather have like the natural landscape, but then I'd have to live in Ann Arbor and that's, that's I can't afford an hour or so.

80
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:13,750
But in our neighborhood, people have found ticks in in grass, like not even super long grass like this, but just even not fully mowed.

81
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:20,020
And then they, you know, post on our actually Facebook group decided on their dogs and stuff like that.

82
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:23,140
And normally you would find it in more forested area.

83
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:29,890
So we're seeing an ticks spreading and, you know, going into more suburban and even urban places.

84
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:38,950
And then increasing urbanization and crowding in different areas can lead to sand flies, which is a vector, Felicia Minaya says.

85
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:49,120
I had a colleague when I was at Indiana University, and he did a lot of research on Leishmaniasis in South America and was certainly lesion analysis.

86
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:57,010
It causes a lot of scabbing and it then is particularly harmful to young children.

87
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:03,310
So there's a couple methods for controlling vectors that we have.

88
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:13,870
First, obviously is using insect repellent with deep picaridin and active ingredients and then reapplying insect repellent as directed.

89
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:18,310
How many of you, like, always put on insect repellent when you go outside?

90
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:25,540
I do. And I have to reply. I don't know why they just like to snack on me.

91
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:32,170
So I get bitten constantly. And even if there's like a little bit that I miss, they'll just.

92
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:35,680
They'll just hone in on it. And I'm super bad at scratching.

93
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:42,100
I know some people in recent years have tried to use, you know, like more natural products,

94
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:48,909
like essential oils, like eucalyptus or lemon and then like things like candles.

95
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:52,630
But those can be partially effective, but not wholly.

96
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:58,660
Another one that they are big on is integrated mosquito management.

97
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:07,780
So this is understanding the mosquito biology and the mosquito lifecycle and a lot of vector control districts try to

98
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:16,780
specifically hunt out the breeding grounds and then eliminate them that way or use things like genetically modified mosquitoes.

99
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:21,640
How many of you have heard about this or talked about this in your other classes?

100
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:26,280
No, no, no. No one's heard of the GMO mosquitoes.

101
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:32,460
So I know this sounds like it's like out of a sci fi sci fi movie, right?

102
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:42,100
So the Zika virus, as we talked about, was like a huge problem in 2016 with hello.

103
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:49,710
With, you know, the spread of the Zika virus coincided with like the 2016 Summer Olympics, etc.

104
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:54,690
So because Zika virus can cause microcephaly,

105
00:10:55,710 --> 00:11:05,130
they were trying to find a solution in order to stop these mosquitoes and the Zika virus, only the females carry Zika virus.

106
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:08,970
The males do not. So their solution was coming up.

107
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:18,720
They created and bred this genetically modified mosquito that for males only that when they bred with the female,

108
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,890
it would result in just like dead progeny.

109
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:35,850
So it's curving the population that way. And they did release these GMO mosquitoes in the Southwest and in California and places like that.

110
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:44,010
You know, I've gotten some questions from other folks about like, how do these mosquitoes potentially affect the food chain,

111
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:52,350
for example, like frogs or other, you know, species that might consume mosquitoes?

112
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:56,459
Hypothetically, man, but honestly, to me determined.

113
00:11:56,460 --> 00:12:06,570
Right. And there's like a, you know, depending on who you talk to, anytime people hear anything that's GMO, including crops, people get very like,

114
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:16,680
you know, they have feelings about it so that, you know, that's that's something that they've recently started doing as one form of IAMA.

115
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:25,680
Another big one is aerial spraying. So growing up in California, like we had West Nile virus, you know,

116
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:30,540
when I was in high school, I was really big and my mom's house had a pool in the back.

117
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:34,559
So like, you know, I had a bird phobia, so she took care of it.

118
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:41,310
But like occasionally if I like dead birds, like floating in the pool just because they had been infected by the mosquito.

119
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:46,830
And I like putting it in like a grocery bag and just, like, throw it away or something like that.

120
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:57,000
But that the Sacramento County YOLO County Vector Control District, like they would put out on the news and in the newspaper and on the radio,

121
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:05,700
like tonight at 6 p.m., like helicopters are going by and like your zip code, like, please stay inside between six and 630.

122
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:15,720
So choppers would just come by and like dump insecticide essentially from the sky to try to curb that way.

123
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:22,290
Or they'll do aerial spraying. Sometimes it's spraying, sometimes it's like a like a powder and aerosolized powder.

124
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:29,730
The next is protecting our water, obviously is key for hand hygiene and personal hygiene.

125
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:37,200
But clean water sources also decrease the likelihood of cholera, typhoid fever, giardia, dysentery,

126
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:46,290
e.coli have a lot of these other ones will go in more details on and then safeguarding their natural resources from things like hazardous waste,

127
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:54,120
agricultural waste point source and secondary sources of pollution.

128
00:13:54,120 --> 00:14:03,090
And then we've talked about this. So before we move on to the next part, any thoughts about these last few slides?

129
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:09,270
Yes, but the GMO mosquitoes were effective.

130
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:12,870
Like, could they measure how the decline of Zika?

131
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:16,750
Mm hmm. Yeah. Yeah. What do you think about it? I'm kind of.

132
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:20,310
Did you guys. It reminds of this, like, Black Mirror episode about the bees.

133
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:24,060
Didn't they see that the GM had some bees and they kind of went out of control?

134
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:33,420
Oh, yes. Just when you I guess if you're sterilizing and you're already controlling for the mosquito populations, it's already declining.

135
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:37,500
So, yeah, I don't know so much about ecology. I feel like that's meaning the ecology question.

136
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:44,970
I'm not I'm not an ecologist, but it's I'd be I mean, that's I guess you can make the ecologists lecture.

137
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:49,430
Um, yeah. I have not seen that Black Mirror episode.

138
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,709
What happened with the bees? I really don't know. I just remember being stern.

139
00:14:52,710 --> 00:15:01,890
But there's nothing somebody could say. Well, we haven't been attacked by swarms of GMO mosquitoes.

140
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:07,469
I did see about the murder Hornets last summer or the summer before that.

141
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:10,800
I think he was not murdered by a hornet, but.

142
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:22,319
Yeah, that's an interesting, you know, like, it's always an interesting ethical dilemma to weigh the pros and cons of,

143
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:28,620
like, certain solutions to modern day problems and to implement implementation of technology.

144
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:33,840
Because we may not know what the long term repercussions of it might be, but,

145
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:38,160
you know, people use the same argument for not getting the COVID vaccine.

146
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,890
Right. So. Hmm. Okay.

147
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:50,610
So for this section here, we're going to talk about emergency preparedness and response and then, you know, compare and contrast different,

148
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:59,610
you know, responses in the region and then talk a little bit about an opioid case study and then some federal entities that are involved.

149
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:04,170
So from local to federal, what does this look like?

150
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:19,680
So according to FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the term emergency management wasn't actually institutionalized until the 1979.

151
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:30,690
So it has three interrelated components. So with emergency management, this is all types of hazards, whether natural, manmade, etc.

152
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:32,700
Emergency partnership.

153
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:43,290
And then looking at the emergency life cycle, so many states will require that local jurisdictions have the position of emergency manager.

154
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:49,379
So, you know, hypothetically for Washtenaw County and we have an emergency manager at the state level,

155
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:55,590
we also for sure have an emergency manager and there's laws for each level of government

156
00:16:55,630 --> 00:17:01,320
defining the responsibility and authority of emergency managers and management programs.

157
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:07,379
But you can imagine, you know, pros and cons of like federalism and division of powers.

158
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:13,140
This also means that for every locality this could mean something totally different.

159
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:23,910
And it's very possible that your emergency manager also functions as another title as well, just because, depending on where you live,

160
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:33,420
they might decide, Oh, the probability of emergencies is actually really low, so this doesn't need to be a designated position for somebody.

161
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:40,559
So they're kind of kind of like double on their duties. So there are four phases of emergency management.

162
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:47,910
And in this slide you can see more detailed notes about what each cycle is but was actually we go from mitigation, preparedness,

163
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:57,300
response and recovery and mitigation is trying to do anything you can to minimize the impact of something before it actually happens.

164
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:00,540
Certain things we can predict are happening.

165
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:09,209
Like, for example, looking at weather forecasts, you can tell that a hurricane is happening at various seismology sites.

166
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:12,750
They are monitoring the seismic activity.

167
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:20,100
So, you know, it's harder to say, okay, an earthquake is going to happen, you know, in two days from now.

168
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:26,160
But based on the increase in seismic activity, they might be able to predict the probability of that happening.

169
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:30,479
And then certain things you just like absolutely can't predict.

170
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:38,010
Right? Like somebody decides to have a gender reveal party in the very dry part of the woods in California.

171
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:43,709
And they catch a lot of dry forest on fire.

172
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:53,640
That's happened multiple times in California and in Joshua Tree, which is a real shame, but essentially trying to minimize the impact of that.

173
00:18:53,640 --> 00:19:04,830
So whether that be like cutting down dry brush, for example, making sure your dams and your infrastructure are up, kept, etc., preparedness.

174
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:06,530
Is exactly what it sounds like.

175
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:15,920
This might be exercising, planning, having standard operating procedures, getting your emergency teams drilled and ready to go.

176
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:19,670
The response is actually go time, right?

177
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:25,310
And then recovery. And I think I have an image of recovery in a little bit.

178
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,799
There are short term and long term recovery.

179
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:36,470
So short term recovery obviously is just trying to get things back as normal as you can or getting people the resources they need,

180
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:43,970
getting them evacuated. But there's also long term recovery generally for these types of events.

181
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:53,959
The ideal situation is when the dust is kind of settled, you do something called hot wash or an after action report to debrief with the team.

182
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:57,470
Like what? Things went really well, what things did not go well?

183
00:19:57,770 --> 00:20:02,239
How can we improve upon it the next time, hopefully?

184
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:10,580
Dr. BIDDINGER Well, we'll discuss some some of his events that he's been deployed at and give you some real examples on Thursday.

185
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:19,129
So in regards to you, the emergency preparedness plan, really, you wouldn't believe how many people,

186
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:26,720
when something happens, doesn't know what to do, where to go or who to call before an event actually occurs.

187
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:31,219
Yes, Mira. Sorry, I just had a couple. Yeah, I work for you.

188
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:38,570
So you actually have done exercises? Yes. To things like hot lunches and stuff afterwards, like a simulation of an emergency.

189
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:41,629
So I thought her before that. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

190
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:46,350
So, like, what do you what do you all usually identify in the hot flashes generally.

191
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:53,960
So we've been doing similar tabletop exercise. Yes, I have. Which is basically just instead of like an actual like simulation.

192
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:58,129
Really go, go, go, go, do something, they're like, what would you do in this situation?

193
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:04,520
Everyone talks about what they should do that afterwards. People kind of like reflect and evaluate you good.

194
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:11,899
You're not doing good for a nice time. And so usually it's a great way to like figure out lessons and improve these

195
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:16,770
exercises and how to improve what the emergency management plans do better for you.

196
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:24,680
Do you feel like when you have the hot shoes, have you been able to implement those changes?

197
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:32,600
So I don't really get to see like how they execute them, that it's usually the company that's executing those changes.

198
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:36,350
But it does it it is really interesting because it's very eye opening for the companies

199
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:40,160
because like the people who are actually working in the emergency physician,

200
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:42,350
they're like, Oh yeah, I know that that's easier.

201
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:47,299
And I'm like the, you know, the event happens and then they're like, Oh, they're actually really not prepared for this.

202
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:50,629
I don't actually know everything that we're supposed to know until they actually

203
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:54,200
learn and realize how important it is and what they actually need to focus on.

204
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,799
Yeah. Thank you for sharing that. Yeah. So yes,

205
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:03,440
tabletop exercises are just as you described and it's frequently used in emergency response and

206
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:08,149
management planning where people like kind of go through a simulation of like what they would do,

207
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:13,610
but again like really talking through things and like a high level of detail.

208
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:17,930
I would say though it's funny that you say like, you know,

209
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:27,440
so my dissertation that I did was like looking at people's intention to evacuate during fire alarms just because my I mean,

210
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:38,750
my Ph.D. is in health behavior. And it's interesting to watch, folks, because those who work in like emergency management and personnel,

211
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:51,680
I've seen them when there's an actual alarm go off, just like be chillin and not even trying to direct people out, you know, of the building.

212
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:57,350
You know, they there's a possibility that they could have known in advance that this was happening and that,

213
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:03,830
you know, it's not an actual fire, but there's tons of smoke producing incidents on the campus all the time.

214
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:14,480
But it also happens like when you work in any field for an extended period of time, you kind of become desensitized to things.

215
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:21,020
And not to say that you become complacent. Some people do become complacent and don't take it as seriously.

216
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:30,980
But because you've been in the field for so long, like based on your own personal perceptions, the severity of the situation decreases.

217
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:35,030
So sometimes we can see that in these situations.

218
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:46,370
You know, I don't I don't know who posts emergency telephone numbers anymore, but you can just Google it.

219
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:51,800
But what happens if the power totally knocks out, right, and all the cell phone towers are gone?

220
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:56,660
I don't know anyone's number by heart except my own.

221
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,190
And now I'm on one, honestly. Like, how many of you have phone numbers memorized?

222
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:05,240
No, you do? Yeah. You do?

223
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:13,820
Just one other. Okay. Yeah, yeah. Having disaster drills, so many people don't have properly installed smoke detectors.

224
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:18,889
Or, you know, when the battery makes that low battery noise and it beeps,

225
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:22,640
people get annoyed and they just like take the battery out rather than replacing it.

226
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:31,550
But the number of house fires every year and sadly, like elderly people and children die because they didn't have smoke detectors, is really high.

227
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:37,130
Having a disaster go kit or a bug out bag in the event of needing to evacuate.

228
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:42,030
How many of you or your family knows someone who has one? Okay, so you do early?

229
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:45,640
Yeah, I worked in public health. That's right.

230
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:49,549
Yeah, I did like so many responses at night.

231
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:53,090
It was not as good as in a volunteer. Ah.

232
00:24:53,090 --> 00:25:01,940
And receiving grade. He had like three like ready to go one in his car when it is office, like one at home.

233
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:06,940
And he had like a machete. Machete like he had like.

234
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:13,070
But yeah, he was like for this on the wound. And then, like, he just he was like so he was like overly committed.

235
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:17,360
So do you really not become like something totally ready to make it?

236
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:23,900
Yeah. Yeah. What's what's in your is just like the basic stuff that, like, humor often outlines.

237
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:27,290
So, like, canned food that hasn't expired,

238
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:36,379
like a hand powered radio and would have covered flashlights and batteries and needed just kind of a bunch of stuff.

239
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:40,160
There's like one for home, and then there's one in my car. Good for you.

240
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:52,000
Hi, Adriana. Um, I think my family also does like camping, and I so like the grandparents, you know, like to have fun, because when I was out there,

241
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,330
when you see, like, the earthquake, it's like little things are like, kind of like in green and like what?

242
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:58,189
I'm always in the house.

243
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:08,990
So, you know, there's like the the metallic kind of bling beads or uh, um, yeah, just like essential camping things that could be used for emergency.

244
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:15,800
Yeah. Thank you for sharing that with us. And if you look like a baked potato.

245
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:23,920
One of my friends used to work for the state of Nebraska for the emergency response department.

246
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:28,610
So she also has a bug up and she has a little bit of a doomsday prepper, though,

247
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:35,600
like is not to like she has a bunker or something, but I think her idea was eventually to get to a bunker.

248
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,260
Yeah. But I mean, it's always it's always good to have that right.

249
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:49,870
I was living in Michigan. This is a force that I've lived in and it has the worst power grid out of any state that I lived in.

250
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:56,319
Like, it's terrible. So any time there is a stiff breeze or a little sprinkle, I lose power at my house.

251
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:06,670
So now I have, like, certain things at my house, like a huge dispenser of like water, for example, or in my car I have charged up.

252
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:13,450
It's a jumper cable, a battery jumper cable that you can jump your car without needing help from anyone, which I've done before.

253
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:17,830
Ten out of ten would recommend, but it also has like USB ports.

254
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:26,920
Right. Or I know neighbors who have solar panel or gas generators, those types of things, making sure,

255
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:33,940
well, you know, ideally the health department has enough PPE to sustain several days of operations.

256
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:41,649
Supply chain contingency plans. This is something that we saw that we did not necessarily have during COVID.

257
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:51,879
If you remember, very early on in the pandemic, you see pictures of health care providers wearing like garbage bags as gowns,

258
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:59,200
as personal protective equipment or people using all kinds of like wild things in lieu of respirators.

259
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,620
Like, I think I was like reading an article where someone had like a,

260
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:08,350
like a plastic jar put around their head going to the grocery store or someone had like those,

261
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:13,719
like the giant inflatable like T Rex outfit that you can wear.

262
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:19,180
And I mean, knowing now that we know now what we know now about the way COVID is spread,

263
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:28,360
it's so interesting to see like the high level of precaution people take took it the beginning versus now where they just, like, don't care anymore.

264
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:31,840
But again, it's that COVID fatigue that factors into it.

265
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,299
Policies and procedures.

266
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:43,700
And then, you know, from the individual to the organizational level of the School of Public Health recently just got a new facilities manager.

267
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:51,819
I don't know, students know or care, but I'm pretty excited about it because the the old person who was in that position,

268
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:57,100
he recently retired, but he's been doing that job for like 30 years.

269
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:02,120
And I mean, aside from like, you know, he wasn't he was nice.

270
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:04,000
Sure. But wasn't like super proactive.

271
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:10,570
So on the sixth floor, for example, we were like, hey, brown water is coming out of the drinking fountain is like, okay.

272
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:17,499
Or like my office was like 90 degrees every day for the, for the whole first summer that I was in here.

273
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:21,430
And he was like, I don't know. Facilities and then central facilities.

274
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:24,850
And came and was like, oh, your office up an installation.

275
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:34,240
And I was like, okay, cool. Or like, we're adding new here this summer when there were a couple of fire event, fire alarm evacuations.

276
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:42,550
Yeah, you were. And we were just standing outside for, like, an hour or something like 40 minutes and then we don't know what happened.

277
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:47,200
And like the fire department didn't even like rush to calm and just some like police

278
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,939
officer rolled up half an hour later and then they like talked among themselves.

279
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:57,940
And then like when the building went out in the building, they were like, okay, we can just come back in like again.

280
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:02,860
Like, these are things I uncovered during my dissertation.

281
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:12,460
Even when folks don't have follow up for evacuations, like why it happened, they feel like they're false alarms or it's nothing to worry about.

282
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:18,040
So the urgency of acting upon it in the future decreases, right?

283
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:22,990
So maybe they can say, oh, you know, just like send a, like a, like a speech wide email.

284
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:29,680
It was like a, you know, some electrical sparks that set off the alarm or like somebody like microwave something.

285
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:36,670
And it caused a lot of smoke. But for the most part, there's generally like little to no follow up in these situations.

286
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:45,429
So obviously with emergency response, the ideal is to be able to like broadly act in a systemic way.

287
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:51,100
And the goal is to mitigate the impact of the event on people, animals and the environment generally.

288
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:58,389
People think of the environment last. So obviously people comes first and then in a lot of events like flooding, etcetera,

289
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:04,750
you'll see a lot of measures to evacuate animals and get them rehomed or placed in appropriate shelters.

290
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:09,910
But response time is absolutely critical for this component.

291
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:23,050
So, you know, some examples where we have some assets deployed are deployment of federal personnel assets during natural disasters like hurricanes,

292
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:31,600
which we'll talk in more detail about. There's something called hazardous waste operations and emergency response here has what for

293
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:37,720
you as a normal person can actually get certified and has water all the industrial hygiene.

294
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:41,620
Students do take a 48 hour has whopper course.

295
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:50,919
So for hazardous waste operations essentially to do that and to be qualified for that, you have to wear what we call a level API,

296
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:59,110
which is a fully encapsulating suit with a supplied breathing apparatus or an SCBA,

297
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:04,240
because you're just assuming you're going into this situation as the worst scenario.

298
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:12,400
Disaster relief, providing volunteers, things, etc., and then emergency and health care and prophylaxis.

299
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:16,840
So a couple of your classmates are actually missing today because they're in fast.

300
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:20,140
So they're doing the emergency response in Kentucky this week.

301
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:27,820
When I was in my master's degree program, I also participated in the Emergency Response Team.

302
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:33,220
And in Nebraska, we would do specific things like anthrax attack.

303
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:38,140
So I think all of you were born after 2001.

304
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:43,540
So some of you were. So. So, but you've heard about the anthrax attacks, right?

305
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:48,520
So anthrax is naturally occurring in the environment.

306
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:54,879
It is spore forming and can be found in a lot of livestock.

307
00:32:54,880 --> 00:33:01,570
But this is the agent that people most worry about being like a biological terrorism agent.

308
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:10,900
So after the 911 incidents, they were sending like, you know, unidentified white powders in the mail to,

309
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:16,020
you know, certain important people in the government and etc.

310
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:20,740
And if inhaled very quickly can, you know, cause death.

311
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:25,210
So that is obviously like a primary concern if not treated.

312
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:29,559
But thankfully, there is treatment or prophylaxis for anthrax,

313
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:38,620
which is a huge distribution of antibiotics and it's antibiotic therapy that you have to be on for several weeks.

314
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:47,260
So for the like exercises that we would do for emergency preparedness, it was basically people from all over Omaha.

315
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:55,130
We go to this training station at the fire department and then learn how to set up the stations for checking people in,

316
00:33:55,540 --> 00:34:01,089
checking their symptoms, getting the pills distributed, and then how to keep records of everything.

317
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:07,780
It's super interesting to see who's involved because obviously as a public health student, like, we're on the team.

318
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:14,590
But there were also like local motorcycle gangs that also participated in the exercises as well.

319
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:20,649
So like these like dudes would just show up like with their like leather jackets

320
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:24,549
and their like bandanas and they would like have their logos and stuff,

321
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:31,120
but they were there participating in the exercises. So it was nice in a way to see that that was a community effort.

322
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:39,910
You know, what are the chances of Omaha being attacked in a biological event?

323
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:46,210
Not unlikely. And I would say especially because of the attention that the Nebraska

324
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:51,370
biocontainment unit has received over the years in terms of the care they provide.

325
00:34:51,370 --> 00:35:02,919
And now there is like a multi-million dollar training facility where national disaster medical personnel come for their periodic trainings there.

326
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:07,900
That does make it somewhat of a target rather than, I don't know, like Bismarck.

327
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:18,790
So in regards to local preparing emergency preparedness response at this is typically at the county level.

328
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:24,130
So I do, yeah. Ideally they are the first to respond.

329
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:32,590
Obviously they control all the assets used in recovery efforts, but volunteers and nonprofits can also partake in this,

330
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:39,160
and they're usually supposed to plan and prepare with support of state and federal governments.

331
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:44,200
This, I would say, is more lockstep for things like natural disasters.

332
00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:50,050
But in incidents like a pandemic, you might see disparate guidance everywhere.

333
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:56,350
So their role as the local emergency response is to act as essentially the first provider,

334
00:35:56,620 --> 00:36:01,420
and they activate what we call the EOC or the emergency operations center.

335
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:10,450
And it is their responsibility to notify the State Emergency Management Agency that they need help.

336
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:17,590
So if they don't proclaim a local state of emergency, they can't move on to the next level.

337
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:25,150
And so the next level, if it's beyond the capabilities of the local health department to take care of,

338
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:29,410
they have to request assistance from the state level.

339
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:33,399
So what do we move on to the state level? Right.

340
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:37,660
The state government may have many localities requesting assistance at.

341
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:45,780
What? So, for example, right before I moved here, that was like the height of the cold pandemic.

342
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:52,170
Probably every county, almost every county in the state was declaring COVID a local emergency.

343
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:56,760
And then I saw that dam break in. Was it Midland?

344
00:36:57,810 --> 00:37:02,520
Midland, yeah. So they had to declare a local emergency to the state.

345
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:07,290
So they're trying to usually address simultaneous things at once.

346
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:13,470
But again, local governments can't directly access anything at the federal level.

347
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:18,540
The state has to essentially serve as an intermediate or a broker between the two.

348
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:24,270
So Washtenaw County can't just go like just say, for example, we had catastrophic flooding here.

349
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:27,599
We can't just go to FEMA and be like FEMA. We need help.

350
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:31,499
We first have to see state of Michigan. We have a local emergency.

351
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:37,560
Is there anything you can do for us? And then at the state of Michigan, it's like this is beyond our capacity.

352
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:41,430
Then they'd have to step up and ask for federal assistance.

353
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:48,510
So state response usually includes situation monitoring, reviewing or responding to local efforts.

354
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,750
Just kind of doing, okay, I see two hands page.

355
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:59,250
I was just wondering like, what is there like a delay between like local to like state and federal or is it pretty like,

356
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:04,350
I don't I'm from Saginaw, so it's like kind of I'm like, okay, I wasn't sure.

357
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:13,080
It depends. Yeah, it depends. And that's going to be my answer to a lot of things you asked me in that class.

358
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:21,930
It depends. So I would say Governor Whitmer is pretty like she has a really fun take talk if you want to follow her.

359
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:29,430
But generally, if from what I've noticed in the last two years of living here when there's a local emergency,

360
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:36,090
she's pretty fast about responding to it and then being there now state to federal.

361
00:38:36,810 --> 00:38:38,070
It depends.

362
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:47,730
It depends on what state it is, what the relationship is like with the federal government and what how important they think it actually is.

363
00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:54,960
Take in 2021 the like strange freezing that happened in Texas.

364
00:38:55,410 --> 00:38:59,760
And at that point, you know, Texas was already like, we're going to secede.

365
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:03,239
Like the week before. They were like, we're going to secede.

366
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:08,430
Like we don't need your like the power grid because usually they can partner with Oklahoma,

367
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:13,410
Nebraska and the states that run above for like crowdsourcing energy.

368
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:16,470
And they were like, We don't need your energy.

369
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:21,389
We can get our own. And then, you know, that kind of thing happened.

370
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:27,780
And of course, people mutual aid flooded in when it wasn't necessarily the federal government.

371
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:37,409
You have nonprofits, local organizations like AOC even came down to Texas and they're all like, she's not so bad after all.

372
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:43,860
And then after she left for like prepaid her again. But like, you know, it totally depends on the state.

373
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:47,190
And I know that's such a frustrating answer and it depends on the situation.

374
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:57,630
And often times, as we'll discuss in coming weeks, when it's mostly minority populations, people will respond a lot slower.

375
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:09,420
Yeah. Yeah. So I would say, like the coverage of the flooding in Jackson, Mississippi, mainly the person I see talking about it is Dr. Robert Bullard.

376
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:15,750
He's considered like the father of environmental justice and he is faculty at Texas Southern.

377
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:20,010
But in terms of like national news, I'm not seeing it.

378
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:30,390
How do you feel? The poll is like I'm seeing more about like second poli boosters and like this drama

379
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:35,339
between like Florence Pugh and Olivia Wilde and this whole Harry Styles thing,

380
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:39,750
right? Like, yeah, it totally depends.

381
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:44,070
Could I know? That was my question as well.

382
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:50,459
Makes sense that for management you have a centralized way of knowing who's asking and being

383
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:54,510
able to like respond to one person instead of having to respond to every county in the state.

384
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:59,030
I was wondering how slow. Yes. Yes.

385
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:03,100
Sometimes, though, we'll talk about Hurricane Katrina in great depth.

386
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:09,960
I love your. You said that you have some earrings. I used them.

387
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:17,440
I used to change them all the time. But then I just gave up on life and stopped doing stuff.

388
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:21,460
A lot of them. Okay. I look forward to it.

389
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:28,890
So when disaster strikes, there are several federal entities involved in response, such as FEMA.

390
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:33,730
So they're supposed to conduct joint plans with state and local governments.

391
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:38,680
They can approve or deny requests for federal assistance.

392
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:48,700
So they don't necessarily have to say yes. And it's also they activate the procedures outlined in the federal response plans and they provide funds.

393
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:53,410
So specifically, we'll focus on infectious disease outbreaks,

394
00:41:53,420 --> 00:42:00,820
but we'll talk about a couple of other things, too, right, in terms of a naturally occurring outbreak.

395
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:06,850
There are things that normally are present in the communities and they can be acute or chronic pathologies.

396
00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:10,890
So acute meaning, you know, short lived, just a burst.

397
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:12,910
It can be really severe or chronic,

398
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:20,530
like things that have been in the community for a while that are considered a slow burn or have new or uncommon symptoms.

399
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:30,130
There may be new strains of influenza virus, different strains of SARS-CoV-2, measles or whooping cough.

400
00:42:30,490 --> 00:42:34,660
I was monitoring this story last week in Argentina,

401
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:41,250
where a lot of people were getting sick and some were dying and they couldn't figure out what it was.

402
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:45,640
And some people are like, Oh my God, it's like another pandemic.

403
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:51,010
It turned out to be Legionella, which is a water borne disease that you often find in,

404
00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:57,130
like cooling water, cooling towers or like water heaters that aren't properly maintained.

405
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:00,670
So I'm glad that they were able to identify this source.

406
00:43:01,030 --> 00:43:09,950
And it's not some novel pathogen. Right. Another example so is this is a specific paper.

407
00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:17,020
So. Q fever. Q fever naturally occurs in livestock like sheep and such like that.

408
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:25,000
It's caused by Cox Yellow Bernardi, and it starts as a bacterial infection but can cause fatal fever.

409
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:28,330
So the natural reservoir is, like I said, you know,

410
00:43:28,330 --> 00:43:35,850
certain livestock and it's transmitted to humans when they breathe in dust contaminated by infected animals.

411
00:43:35,890 --> 00:43:43,120
So just say the animal is infected with Q fever and they have their spit or they're shedding it in their feces,

412
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:46,479
obviously that defecates into the ground.

413
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:51,790
And then if you're like kicking up dust and whatnot, you can possibly inhale it this way.

414
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:59,530
So in this particular study in 98, 99, in the Bush de Rhone district of southern France,

415
00:43:59,830 --> 00:44:04,750
there was an outbreak of Q fever that essentially started here.

416
00:44:04,990 --> 00:44:15,410
But because of the wind pattern, heavy wind facilitated aerosol transmission to this entire geographic swath there.

417
00:44:15,430 --> 00:44:21,330
So people were just getting wildly ill with Q Fever and they were able to figure that out.

418
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:27,040
Usually you can curb that through vaccination of livestock and making sure you have healthy animals.

419
00:44:27,550 --> 00:44:31,690
A couple of years ago, there was also a Q fever outbreak in Seattle.

420
00:44:32,930 --> 00:44:40,050
I want to guess why. Okay.

421
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:44,370
I mean, you ever see the show Portlandia? Okay.

422
00:44:44,370 --> 00:44:54,000
So there were some folks like some hipsters, you know, making gold soap and natural products in their backyard in Seattle.

423
00:44:54,930 --> 00:44:59,490
And they just they don't vaccinate. They didn't vaccinate their animals.

424
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:03,330
So they caused, like, a minor outbreak of Q fever there.

425
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:08,700
Yeah. It feels weird being on this end of the room, but try it out.

426
00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:14,280
Okay, so again, we talked about purposeful release, the biological attack or bioterrorism.

427
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:19,800
Mostly, we're concerned with pathogens classified as Category A,

428
00:45:19,830 --> 00:45:26,550
and this is a designation by the United Nations that the CDC uses as well, sometimes called risk group for.

429
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:41,640
So these are things that we consider highly contagious, highly infectious and little to no treatment or difficult to treat.

430
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:49,410
So plague, for example, botulism, viral hemorrhagic fever, smallpox, tularemia.

431
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:58,440
Tularemia is a category, a pathogen where the natural host is, again, like wildlife, particularly rabbits.

432
00:45:58,890 --> 00:46:05,160
So every year they'll have a couple of cases of tularemia where somebody like was on their ride mower and they, like,

433
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:10,620
accidentally mowed over like a like a wild bunny and just, like, you know,

434
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:15,570
cleaned things off without using any PPE and they got, you know, tularemia that way.

435
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:21,410
Personal story about tularemia for a while.

436
00:46:21,410 --> 00:46:29,020
With my ex-partner, I was trying to be supportive and like I tried to play Daddy for a year.

437
00:46:29,030 --> 00:46:38,629
It was not for me. But every Saturday we had to go to his friend's house for like five friggin hours.

438
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:41,720
And I'm a very practical person. I'm not, like, imaginative.

439
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:47,210
So when I'm looking at like a whiteboard with the grid doing like a scenario, I'm just like, No, what is this?

440
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:56,690
I was like writing my dissertation, like, while they were doing stuff. But that house also happens to run this nonprofit called The Pipsqueak Tree.

441
00:46:57,110 --> 00:47:03,290
They do have a very cute social media presence, but it started out as like a rescue for hamsters and guinea pigs,

442
00:47:03,290 --> 00:47:09,829
but they expanded it to like now they have like half barrels and stuff and like rabbits.

443
00:47:09,830 --> 00:47:15,469
And so I was wanting to use the bathroom and they were like, Oh,

444
00:47:15,470 --> 00:47:22,130
just letting you know there's some rabbits in the bathroom right now that were quarantining for tularemia.

445
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:30,010
And I was like, Cool, cool, cool. Let me get out of here and I want to play this game anymore.

446
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:34,709
After a year, I quit. So. I doesn't do anything.

447
00:47:34,710 --> 00:47:41,070
I want to say this. But again, the anthrax attacks of 2001.

448
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:49,350
If you ever have the chance to go, I recently was in D.C. and went to the U.S. Postal Museum.

449
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:57,540
Very cool. But they have an entire display about, you know, the important role that mail carriers play.

450
00:47:57,570 --> 00:48:03,740
They have a whole display on, like, drugs, you know, drug cartels and like drugs being smuggled through the mail and stuff.

451
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:08,160
But then they also have, you know, talking about bombs and then biological agents as well.

452
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:18,210
You know, sometimes we have outbreaks caused by primary events like hurricanes, like we talked about leptospirosis.

453
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:28,110
I would not be surprised in Mississippi if there aren't some cases of leptospirosis that occur just from like all the dust and dirt and

454
00:48:28,470 --> 00:48:38,730
and things in the streets with all the like theses urine carried by rodents that now are contaminating natural water sources as well.

455
00:48:39,570 --> 00:48:47,490
Flint, which we'll talk about extensively, had a secondary effect where because there was poor infrastructure,

456
00:48:47,730 --> 00:48:51,840
it also led to 90 cases of Legionnaires disease.

457
00:48:52,680 --> 00:49:00,660
So Legionella is a bacteria, like I said, that grows in water systems and water containing systems like cooling towers,

458
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:06,060
and it spreads through droplets that are small enough for people to breathe in or aspirated.

459
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:11,460
Yes, Pete Wednesday, which is like my undergrad, they had an outbreak of vision.

460
00:49:11,670 --> 00:49:15,030
Oh, boy. Did it. And did people die?

461
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:16,469
I don't think so.

462
00:49:16,470 --> 00:49:27,180
I think of the next person was like in fact, I did like a whole university wide search and the dorm building I was in had to be, like, evacuated.

463
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:35,970
Okay. The place on the corner. Yeah. It's it's a tricky one because it's the symptoms start out very nonspecific.

464
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:45,810
So also, the local health department has to be good enough at contact tracing to figure out what the source actually is.

465
00:49:45,930 --> 00:49:56,900
So, like, like I mentioned Argentina with this Legionella case, they were able to aggressively contact, trace enough of or Sarah who's not here today.

466
00:49:56,910 --> 00:50:05,780
She sent me this interesting podcast about Bluebonnet, you know, the ice cream place and how they keep having listeria outbreaks.

467
00:50:05,790 --> 00:50:14,130
And this like I'm super lactose intolerant sometimes, but, you know, like we still have some ongoing outbreaks that are considered more long term.

468
00:50:14,730 --> 00:50:17,730
I made this slide last year feeling hopeful.

469
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:27,420
So just like, you know, so H1N1, obviously, 2009, West Africa, we had 14 to 16,

470
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:33,450
but then Democratic Republic of Congo had their own respective outbreaks, 2018 and 2020.

471
00:50:33,450 --> 00:50:38,370
And then we see occasional cases pop up since it's endemic to certain parts of the world.

472
00:50:38,370 --> 00:50:41,790
And then obviously COVID is still out going ongoing.

473
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:50,970
In an ideal world, you know, we do consider infectious diseases now a public health threat.

474
00:50:51,210 --> 00:50:59,460
And I would hope because of COVID, ideally, everybody now has standard operating procedures and what is to happen in that event.

475
00:51:00,450 --> 00:51:07,920
It was interesting because I had the privilege of helping with the Michigan Economic Recovery Consortia.

476
00:51:08,250 --> 00:51:11,880
So they decided to give me this job in March of 2020.

477
00:51:12,210 --> 00:51:18,360
And then by April of 2020, I was helping the Department of Labor and the Governor's Task Force,

478
00:51:18,810 --> 00:51:23,010
even though I still living in Indiana and working for an entirely different university.

479
00:51:23,370 --> 00:51:27,090
But they were like, Hey, you know, stuff about this stuff. And I was like, I guess so.

480
00:51:27,870 --> 00:51:33,540
So myself and Dr. Neitzel, who is in our department and he's another industrial hygienist,

481
00:51:33,930 --> 00:51:39,420
we got tasked with doing a risk assessment for different industries for COVID.

482
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:42,570
And they wanted like, you know, being in government,

483
00:51:42,570 --> 00:51:51,149
they don't necessarily understand the full breadth of how complex it is to calculate these these types of situations.

484
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:56,820
But they wanted like a clear answer, right? So we did something that's called control banding.

485
00:51:56,820 --> 00:52:04,320
So control banding is when you don't have like a known occupational exposure limit, like with you do like ammonia.

486
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:08,040
Ideally in a day you should be exposed to more than a thousand parts per million dollar kind of stuff.

487
00:52:08,430 --> 00:52:14,159
So control banding is when you take what you know based on evidence based practices,

488
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:20,550
but also practice based practices and determine what's considered high risk, medium risk and low risk.

489
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:25,799
And they wanted myself and Dr. Neitzel to look at all these different industries and

490
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:32,850
deter and score them for when they would be able to go back after the shutdown.

491
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:39,330
And Rick and I were like, ah, like literally playing with people's lives.

492
00:52:39,450 --> 00:52:42,480
Like, meet us so nervous.

493
00:52:42,930 --> 00:52:50,380
So based on the risk scoring, we got maybe like 11 industries construction all the way to Casino.

494
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:54,690
Obviously, Casino went back last based on our scoring,

495
00:52:54,690 --> 00:53:01,290
but we allowed construction to go back May 7th of 2020 just because of what we knew about the virus at the time.

496
00:53:01,710 --> 00:53:09,210
Mostly outdoor activities. Construction workers generally have some level of familiarization with personal protective equipment,

497
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:13,049
not necessarily fade filter and phase piece respirators.

498
00:53:13,050 --> 00:53:19,600
But, you know, at some point they've worn like face fitting respirators and they wear hard hats and all that.

499
00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:25,360
So we slowly released, you know, I think Governor Whitmer did like five two week stages.

500
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:26,690
Who could call back?

501
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:36,479
So that was part of us helping out with their standard operating procedures and coming up with all these, like, playbook situations.

502
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:44,550
But not every entity has that. I didn't get paid, but I got a kudos from the school.

503
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:50,000
So. So components of an IDR plan.

504
00:53:50,010 --> 00:53:54,930
So usually you have some kind of organizational overview and command structure.

505
00:53:56,370 --> 00:54:02,610
We like to have democracy, but in an emergency, democracy is not that time.

506
00:54:02,910 --> 00:54:08,160
You need somebody who serves as the incident commander. They're not necessarily hands on,

507
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:15,060
but the person everybody reports to and they take a bird's eye view of the situation where they know what their resources are,

508
00:54:15,390 --> 00:54:21,420
what everybody is doing, so that they can essentially delegate tasks accordingly.

509
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:30,719
Then you have operation sections, which usually has the very basic, you know, disease containment, medical treatment, epi surveillance data.

510
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:35,490
What do we know specific to our situation? And then logistics and finances.

511
00:54:35,490 --> 00:54:41,250
Like what's what stuff do we actually how to stop war suppliers, how much money do we have?

512
00:54:41,250 --> 00:54:47,130
And then they might have what we call in Jax, which are situations, specific scenarios.

513
00:54:48,570 --> 00:54:57,660
So looking at this as a Great Lakes region, because throughout this class, I'll talk a lot about the Great Lakes area as COVID 19.

514
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:01,950
So you know COVID. Yeah.

515
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:05,040
Okay. So starting first with Illinois.

516
00:55:05,370 --> 00:55:12,300
So Illinois, here they have a population of about almost 13 million.

517
00:55:12,750 --> 00:55:20,460
And pretty early on, the governor on March 9th declared all counties in a state of disaster.

518
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:28,430
So by that, the state of emergency was declared four days later and they were able to get federal assistance.

519
00:55:28,830 --> 00:55:32,940
Their stay at home order lasted a little bit more than two months.

520
00:55:33,090 --> 00:55:41,270
To you, just stretch. Okay. So they had 22 state bills related to COVID 19.

521
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:46,050
Again, most of them focused largely on emergency measures, general aid and policies.

522
00:55:46,470 --> 00:55:56,760
So they had unemployment benefits, a COVID 19 death plan, economic vitality plan, secure choice, saving options, rental assistance,

523
00:55:57,120 --> 00:56:05,040
and then opioids and naloxone assistance, because they recognize the relationship between those two things going on.

524
00:56:05,610 --> 00:56:14,010
Whereas in Indiana, where I was living at the time, the governor did declare a public health emergency on March six,

525
00:56:15,210 --> 00:56:20,520
and a state of emergency was declared the same day that around the same time that Illinois did.

526
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:26,820
But the stay at home order there lasted more like six weeks instead of two months.

527
00:56:27,450 --> 00:56:36,269
Population of almost 7 million zero state bills related to COVID zero low testing rates.

528
00:56:36,270 --> 00:56:43,950
At the start of the pandemic, which I can attest to, they did extend state issued licenses and permits.

529
00:56:43,950 --> 00:56:51,810
So if you're a business with a state issued license or if your driver's license had expired, they were like, don't worry about that right now.

530
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:57,480
But other than having a reopening plan, they really didn't do much.

531
00:56:58,470 --> 00:57:07,209
So Indianapolis, for example, which is a huge city, they obviously had more restrictive measures than this rural city that I live nearby.

532
00:57:07,210 --> 00:57:14,220
I named Jasper. Right. So mask mandates totally varied by county, but even depending on the city.

533
00:57:14,580 --> 00:57:21,059
So I lived in another college town, Bloomington, and they were obviously very restrictive in terms of their measures.

534
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:25,620
But the minute you go outside of town, it was like nothing had happened.

535
00:57:27,270 --> 00:57:30,330
Michigan, almost 10 million.

536
00:57:31,410 --> 00:57:39,370
Governor Whitmer declared the. State of emergency. A longer shutdown in the Great Lakes region.

537
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:43,690
March 24th to June 5th. How many of you were here during it?

538
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:48,580
How did you feel? Yeah.

539
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:52,670
You're like. You just look tired of, like. Like like.

540
00:57:52,870 --> 00:57:57,180
Like. I mean, what did you do during that time? Like, classes were all moved online, right?

541
00:57:58,020 --> 00:58:01,420
It was kind of nice, like, kind of like all the time.

542
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:04,660
Okay, so you liked it. How about you?

543
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:12,070
Okay, well, I was like the longest time I was able to spend with my family.

544
00:58:12,190 --> 00:58:16,739
Okay. And felt weird because, like, I was like. I felt, like, very safe and comfortable.

545
00:58:16,740 --> 00:58:21,900
Like, you know, like other people were struggling. So it's, like, very strange to feel internal.

546
00:58:22,810 --> 00:58:28,460
Yeah. a.S.A.P. Yeah, it's that high.

547
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:35,439
And I didn't even have as long to shutdown as all of you. But in the middle of this, I was, like, busy trying to, like, buy a house and move here.

548
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:40,839
So I was like going back and forth between here in Indiana to, like, do inspections and then, like,

549
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:49,030
try to close and like stay at a, like a random, like random hotels and just like, oh, like it's a whole thing, but.

550
00:58:49,270 --> 00:58:55,210
41 state bills related to COVID. So insurance and coverage for COVID 19 treatment.

551
00:58:55,570 --> 00:59:03,520
Insurance for businesses, a massive interruption. They created a task force on racial disparities, which a lot of states did not do.

552
00:59:04,180 --> 00:59:07,180
Small business relief program security benefits,

553
00:59:07,570 --> 00:59:12,459
marriage license signature requirements waived because usually you have to have witnesses for those

554
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:18,460
kinds of things and a bunch of other measures that the state implemented that some people really hated.

555
00:59:20,230 --> 00:59:25,330
And then, okay, so Minnesota, smaller population, about half the size of Michigan,

556
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:33,339
their stay at home order was also about six weeks, but they had 75 state bills related to COVID.

557
00:59:33,340 --> 00:59:42,430
So they got a telemedicine grant in order to expand the equipment and people's access and ability to see their doctor over the Internet.

558
00:59:42,430 --> 00:59:51,190
Because people, lot of places in rural areas don't actually have Internet distance learning broadband access grant program established.

559
00:59:51,610 --> 00:59:59,620
I would say the thing that for a lot of things frustrated me about the pandemic in particular.

560
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:03,760
I don't have kids, they're fine. They exist, right?

561
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:05,200
I used to work with kids,

562
01:00:05,650 --> 01:00:17,110
but it my personal take was it felt really unfair to me that children who didn't necessarily have the decision and autonomy were facing a lot of the

563
01:00:17,110 --> 01:00:25,540
consequences and will still continue to face the consequences of things that happened during the pandemic because of the decision of adults like,

564
01:00:25,540 --> 01:00:29,019
for example, their normal socialization and peak years.

565
01:00:29,020 --> 01:00:42,340
I was reading a study where students returning to school now are several grades behind in math and reading just the adjustment to normal life.

566
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:46,450
But you see some kids who are like low six kids.

567
01:00:46,450 --> 01:00:54,729
This would have been me if I was K-through-12 during that time because we had like dial up Internet sometimes at my house.

568
01:00:54,730 --> 01:01:04,420
But kids who were doing their homework in parking lots outside of like a Starbucks, for example, or like the local libraries were also shut down.

569
01:01:04,420 --> 01:01:06,610
So they had nowhere with Internet access.

570
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:16,930
It's not necessarily like the affluent kids whose parents have like fiber Internet and can still afford to have like a babysitter slash tutor,

571
01:01:18,580 --> 01:01:20,379
have them continue with their lessons.

572
01:01:20,380 --> 01:01:29,500
But kids who were already behind because of their situation in life, which they didn't necessarily choose being put further behind.

573
01:01:29,510 --> 01:01:33,220
So at least Minnesota. Yes.

574
01:01:33,470 --> 01:01:36,850
I just want to. You're in Minnesota and Wisconsin and Wisconsin.

575
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:41,860
Sorry, I lived in Oak and I was there during when my children started.

576
01:01:43,090 --> 01:01:47,520
And it it's interesting to think like the rest of these states close,

577
01:01:47,530 --> 01:01:53,350
like Minnesota isn't that great but I live in Minneapolis and the whole George Floyd thing.

578
01:01:53,410 --> 01:02:01,750
Oh, please. All this is going on. And while something like that sounds great, you also have to think about, like, capacity to distribute.

579
01:02:01,750 --> 01:02:09,879
Yeah, all of the things. So a lot of I had some friends who worked in education, but like they have students who are unhoused.

580
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:18,610
So how do you even get internet services to them or like it was tasked with, like the teachers to make sure these resources are getting out to them?

581
01:02:18,610 --> 01:02:25,209
So if you have 30 students and you're like, well, we're going virtual on Monday and I have to get all of this stuff to them.

582
01:02:25,210 --> 01:02:28,690
And then some of them didn't get students online until we grew it.

583
01:02:28,690 --> 01:02:32,650
So it's great that they have it, but I think the like roll out practicality or the.

584
01:02:32,850 --> 01:02:36,430
Fermentation is also really important to consider when looking at.

585
01:02:36,990 --> 01:02:40,790
Yes. Thank you. Had a great point. Total area.

586
01:02:41,730 --> 01:02:50,620
Do I know what what extent it was actually ruled out? I don't. So here in the kinesiology school,

587
01:02:50,620 --> 01:02:58,779
Dr. Rebecca Hasson was doing something similar ish where kids who didn't have Internet

588
01:02:58,780 --> 01:03:03,580
access because she does cooney's she still wanted to get a physical education,

589
01:03:03,910 --> 01:03:13,360
but realize a lot of them don't have internet at their house, so there was no way for them to join class, let alone like do a Zoom P.E. class.

590
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:22,689
So they were able to get a state grant where they did like these 15 minute exercise classes that were broadcast on the local television stations.

591
01:03:22,690 --> 01:03:28,330
Because even though those kids families didn't have Internet, they at least have like antenna or some kind of TV.

592
01:03:28,630 --> 01:03:35,860
And then they are starting to do like a group community lessons as well based on like points of location.

593
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:39,430
So yeah, great point. You're totally yeah, this seems great.

594
01:03:39,430 --> 01:03:47,469
But to what extent does a school hourly employees compensation, temporary employment insurance, eviction,

595
01:03:47,470 --> 01:03:56,410
mortgage foreclosure protections Ohio just below us with this population of nearly 12 million.

596
01:03:56,410 --> 01:03:59,350
So they're a little bit bigger than how they are in Michigan.

597
01:03:59,350 --> 01:04:07,270
But they asked all state departments to declare an emergency again, early, early March and stay at home.

598
01:04:07,270 --> 01:04:17,589
Orders lasted almost two months, surprisingly, and they had 40 bills related to COVID, so they halted debt collection.

599
01:04:17,590 --> 01:04:26,970
They temporarily waived certain Medicare requirements, suspended homestead interest in foreclosures, relief student loan payments.

600
01:04:26,980 --> 01:04:39,270
Wisconsin a population of almost 6 million to exactly on the dot two month stay at home order one bill related to COVID and that was just for

601
01:04:39,270 --> 01:04:47,890
a general aid and then mask mandates varied by area and so they closures and restrictions not to put you on a spot but it did feel this way.

602
01:04:48,580 --> 01:04:53,110
I was in Minnesota. Oh, you were in Minnesota. Okay. Right. But your family was in Wisconsin.

603
01:04:53,380 --> 01:04:59,320
We were all oh, you were on Minnesota. Okay, okay. My family was in California.

604
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:03,280
So it was very different to hear what was going on there.

605
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:11,530
But unfortunately, my mom was a nurse at a nursing home, so she had to keep just had to keep working and got told it pretty early on.

606
01:05:11,530 --> 01:05:16,310
And my dad, like the worst thing that happened to him was like his cruise around New Zealand was canceled.

607
01:05:16,330 --> 01:05:23,920
But whatever for the state of New York, they had a population of almost 20 million.

608
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:32,680
And when you look at the case rate early on, it's super high compared to the other states, but that's mostly coming from New York City.

609
01:05:32,860 --> 01:05:38,530
That's bumping that up, not like Albany or like Buffalo, for example.

610
01:05:38,830 --> 01:05:43,690
And they obviously had a ton of state bills related to COVID just because of

611
01:05:43,690 --> 01:05:47,980
how disproportionately affected New York City was and the surrounding areas.

612
01:05:48,380 --> 01:05:57,760
It's kind of interesting to see, depending on the state that you're in, which things they choose to prioritize in particular.

613
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:07,150
So again, telemedicine obviously was a big thing, sick leave, and then they had an essential employees hazard grant program.

614
01:06:07,660 --> 01:06:19,020
Pennsylvania also kind of a higher case rate, but also bumped up by Philly and Pittsburgh mostly focus on benefits for officers,

615
01:06:19,060 --> 01:06:28,210
interestingly covered benefits for the National Guard that were responding there and then long term testing for PPE,

616
01:06:28,450 --> 01:06:36,969
for long term care facilities, and then providing PPE to polling place workers because Pennsylvania, like Michigan, is sometimes a swing state.

617
01:06:36,970 --> 01:06:45,070
So again, very interesting to see where the different priorities have gone in the different Great Lakes regions.

618
01:06:47,860 --> 01:06:53,620
Any questions or comments about about that before we move on to this next part?

619
01:06:56,050 --> 01:07:02,350
Okay. So opioids in particular. Let me give you just a quick rundown on opioids.

620
01:07:02,860 --> 01:07:08,500
Opioids are a synthetic or natural chemicals that are essentially used to control pain.

621
01:07:09,010 --> 01:07:15,790
So this is things like oxycodone, which is also known as poppy, cotton, Percocet.

622
01:07:16,060 --> 01:07:23,650
So this makes me think about future song. Fentanyl, methadone, Vicodin, codeine and morphine.

623
01:07:24,070 --> 01:07:33,190
So since the opioid epidemic has been what has been identified since like the 1990s, but it's really been raging in the 20 tens and beyond.

624
01:07:33,940 --> 01:07:41,410
And again, there's just this culture here in the United States where think about it like you're a worker that does a physically laborious job.

625
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:44,830
You have no simply benefits are very minimal.

626
01:07:44,840 --> 01:07:52,030
Right. You get injured at work. You can't take time off like somewhere where construction, you don't get paid unless you work that day.

627
01:07:52,030 --> 01:07:56,799
It's not salaried. So obviously you want to keep working, right.

628
01:07:56,800 --> 01:08:03,940
But you don't have time to heal and recover. You don't have time to go to physical therapy or physical therapy isn't covered.

629
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:08,350
Took you six weeks to see your PCP because that's how long the wait was.

630
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:20,450
What do you want? A quick solution. So a confluence of factors led to this overprescription of opioids here in the United States.

631
01:08:20,470 --> 01:08:27,010
Part of it is workplace culture. Some of it is kickbacks to physicians that from pharmaceutical companies.

632
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:31,140
Lots of different shows and documentaries and stuff about it.

633
01:08:31,150 --> 01:08:37,330
Now, I think there's a Hulu show about the Dopesick Dopesick Oxycodone family are on Netflix.

634
01:08:37,330 --> 01:08:42,580
The pharmacist is a docu series about this dad who's a pharmacist and his son

635
01:08:43,030 --> 01:08:50,770
overdosed actually on heroin after being addicted to prescription opioids.

636
01:08:51,160 --> 01:09:02,830
I remember back in 2011, I got to wisdom teeth removed and they gave me a month's supply of Vicodin.

637
01:09:03,550 --> 01:09:11,260
Isn't that wild? I didn't take any of it because opioids overshare make you very constipated.

638
01:09:11,260 --> 01:09:18,610
So how's that for me? Thank you. But at the time, like, I didn't realize how powerful Vicodin was.

639
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:22,940
I had another sweet mate. Same thing. Got her wisdom teeth removed. They gave her a month's supply of bacon.

640
01:09:22,940 --> 01:09:30,310
And she took it, though. But it was it's they just they used to just take them, take the pills.

641
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:38,950
So, you know, if we're talking about the science of addiction, it depends on a number of factors,

642
01:09:38,950 --> 01:09:42,250
your environmental factors, but also your biological factors.

643
01:09:43,090 --> 01:09:51,160
Depending on the confluence of those things, it can take as little as ten days for you to start to become dependent on opioids,

644
01:09:51,370 --> 01:09:57,550
meaning if you stop taking them, you start to have withdrawal symptoms basically, but also psychologically.

645
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:00,910
And when your prescription ends, right?

646
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:10,660
Some people may have the option where they try to obtain other pills, black market or from somebody else or they'll like, you know,

647
01:10:10,660 --> 01:10:17,710
hoard them even though they're expired in their medicine cabinet, you know, like saving it, kind of like for a rainy day situation.

648
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:27,700
Heroin is chemically close in structure to a lot of prescription opioids.

649
01:10:28,150 --> 01:10:35,890
So once people are not able to obtain those prescription opioids anymore, they'll start using heroin because it costs less.

650
01:10:36,160 --> 01:10:40,120
But it's also more widely available. Again, highly addictive.

651
01:10:40,420 --> 01:10:49,000
Usually injection with needles. And I've snorted my ex-partner and seen one that used to make you play the candy was an addictions counselor,

652
01:10:51,010 --> 01:11:00,130
mostly court ordered folks and did group counseling, and a lot of his clients were like in the trades and labor.

653
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:05,919
And he said some of his clients said because of how hard it is to get prescription opioids,

654
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:12,970
now they're just skipping over that and just going straight to heroin when they get injured at work as a form of pain relief,

655
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:21,040
which is the sad reality of, you know, like, you know, I won't go too far down this rabbit hole,

656
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:29,200
but how we don't treat addiction here in the United States as a disease, but letting things get to that stage in the workplace in the first place.

657
01:11:30,490 --> 01:11:35,410
Fentanyl is and yes, you know, doctors overprescribe with opioids.

658
01:11:35,410 --> 01:11:41,440
Like, do they get paid for it, too, along with like the I just don't understand.

659
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:45,669
Like, oh, the pharmaceutical kickback situation. Oh, yeah.

660
01:11:45,670 --> 01:11:48,840
Oh yeah. So they get a lot of money for that. Yeah.

661
01:11:48,850 --> 01:11:55,270
Yeah. So depending on. So I used to intern at the.

662
01:11:55,540 --> 01:11:59,380
I think I mentioned to you a refugee. The main refugee intake clinic.

663
01:11:59,710 --> 01:12:02,800
But it was part of a larger Catholic health initiative system.

664
01:12:03,190 --> 01:12:11,110
And, you know, everybody would be so excited when the pharmaceutical reps came because they would always bring like incentives,

665
01:12:11,110 --> 01:12:16,780
like free lunch and stuff. So it was either like Chick-Fil-A or like Greek food or whatever.

666
01:12:16,780 --> 01:12:21,249
And we would just sit there for a lunch and learn, listen to them.

667
01:12:21,250 --> 01:12:25,239
Like, I swear, one time it was like. Like to, like somebody who was like.

668
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:27,910
It's for pills for people who are severely constipated.

669
01:12:28,690 --> 01:12:34,299
And we're just like sitting there in L.A., Salt Lake residents and, like, you know, attendings and stuff like that.

670
01:12:34,300 --> 01:12:41,800
And the incentive for these pharmaceutical reps to come. Pharmaceutical reps generally aren't trained in the health sciences.

671
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:49,030
There just have to be attractive, charismatic people who are able to essentially sell this medication.

672
01:12:49,030 --> 01:12:53,410
They memorize a script and they can answer questions about the effects and benefits.

673
01:12:53,710 --> 01:13:03,400
But, you know, just say first something like generic, for example, ethinyl estradiol, which is like an oral birth control pill.

674
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:12,550
That's a generic version. It's free under Obamacare. Just pretend like we're living in a world where B.C. wasn't free right now the word.

675
01:13:12,700 --> 01:13:16,030
But there's specific brands like like Yasmin and Rosella.

676
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:23,980
So I might, you know, come to a doctor's office, be like, I'm a pharmaceutical rep for Yasmin,

677
01:13:24,310 --> 01:13:37,510
and if you exclusively prescribe Yasmin to your your patients will give you like a bonus or we'll give you a really nice car,

678
01:13:37,510 --> 01:13:39,700
we'll give you a Tesla or something like that.

679
01:13:40,120 --> 01:13:49,420
So with opioids in particular, like OxyContin, if more if the demand is higher because more physicians are prescribing it,

680
01:13:49,750 --> 01:13:54,790
they're manufacturing at a greater rate, making more money for the pharmaceutical company.

681
01:13:54,790 --> 01:14:03,639
And then the doctors who essentially, like give their allegiance to these pharmaceutical companies to specifically like I only, you know,

682
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:09,129
even if like just say another painkiller like Tylenol with codeine was more appropriate and doesn't matter,

683
01:14:09,130 --> 01:14:13,230
I'm still going to just prescribe them OxyContin because that's why I have the partnership with.

684
01:14:13,900 --> 01:14:17,890
So that's kind of how some of these things happen is basically I actually money

685
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:21,610
thinks I used to work as a medical assistant in some clinics I worked in.

686
01:14:21,610 --> 01:14:26,290
They were allowed to have the farm reps come in and like bring all these like big lunches.

687
01:14:26,290 --> 01:14:32,229
Yeah, yeah. And everyone loved it. But then other clinics restricted that, like you weren't allowed to take the incentives.

688
01:14:32,230 --> 01:14:35,629
Yes. Yeah. So which is a good thing. Yeah, it's interesting.

689
01:14:35,630 --> 01:14:40,420
Like, I didn't really know like what was happening. I just took the food and it yeah.

690
01:14:40,720 --> 01:14:46,390
I mean, at this clinic in particular because we worked with resettled refugees like they all the residents were like,

691
01:14:46,390 --> 01:14:51,310
we'll take the free lunch, but we prescribe them all generics because that's all they can afford.

692
01:14:51,310 --> 01:14:56,260
So like I'll listen to you talk about your stool softeners for an hour, but like at the end of the day, thank you for lunch.

693
01:14:56,260 --> 01:15:04,510
And every pound, you know, where some companies like dermatology company specific like treatments or microdermabrasion,

694
01:15:04,540 --> 01:15:08,229
it doesn't have to be something as nefarious as painkillers.

695
01:15:08,230 --> 01:15:11,110
It kind of happens like across the board.

696
01:15:11,230 --> 01:15:19,600
Yeah, it's kind of scary that they don't have like any background in the sciences or know these are just like, just memorize like a script.

697
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:27,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Providers do. They do their research usually when they do like make the partnership on the medicine.

698
01:15:28,180 --> 01:15:31,350
I'm sorry, I'm asking. No, I mean. I mean sometimes.

699
01:15:31,350 --> 01:15:40,079
But I mean not to like what will continue with this, but not to, like, disparage physicians.

700
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:44,880
Right. Because obviously they go through different trainings. It's just that we all have different skill sets.

701
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:56,040
So as you add, not again, not to say all physicians are like terrible people or whatever, but if you notice broadly during the pandemic,

702
01:15:56,040 --> 01:16:02,999
you know, if you have an M.D., everybody's now suddenly an infectious disease expert or I was watching like this,

703
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:08,130
like little mini Twitter battle where this sleep doctor was saying, like,

704
01:16:08,160 --> 01:16:18,000
you should bleach your wastewater before flushing it because that's how people will get monkeypox and then somebody call them out.

705
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,430
Those like what you're like and literally just asleep.

706
01:16:20,430 --> 01:16:30,659
Doctor And during the time that we worked with the Ebola response, we would have physicians like the units that they receive, like the the education.

707
01:16:30,660 --> 01:16:32,459
In the four years of medical education,

708
01:16:32,460 --> 01:16:38,340
they received learning things about like the principles of personal protective equipment and how it actually works.

709
01:16:38,340 --> 01:16:43,410
It's like very little. So we had a doctor come up to us who was wearing an N95 and he was like,

710
01:16:43,740 --> 01:16:48,270
It's getting harder for me to breathe, which means it's working correctly, right?

711
01:16:48,270 --> 01:16:49,259
And we were like, No,

712
01:16:49,260 --> 01:16:57,989
that means you need to change your a 95 now because the filter is either saturated with your saliva or it's totally contaminated.

713
01:16:57,990 --> 01:17:02,210
And this was like 2015, like there were no supply chain issues.

714
01:17:02,220 --> 01:17:10,200
So we all have education expertize to varying levels that can just totally depend on the person.

715
01:17:10,200 --> 01:17:13,349
So you might not like some physicians who are like super on it,

716
01:17:13,350 --> 01:17:19,799
like they're reading the latest articles about addiction medicine and then you just have some people who are just like coasting,

717
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:23,070
you know, and they just do what they do.

718
01:17:23,070 --> 01:17:27,600
But they, they have this certain mentality where it's like, I know everything.

719
01:17:27,990 --> 01:17:32,040
I've definitely been in doctor's offices when they clearly were like Googling stuff.

720
01:17:32,040 --> 01:17:36,540
I told them in front of me, How many is that? Has that happened to you or Yeah, yeah.

721
01:17:37,710 --> 01:17:39,000
So it's complicated.

722
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:47,640
But yeah, for the pharmaceutical reps generally they just try to pick someone who's really attractive and charismatic, like a sales person.

723
01:17:48,120 --> 01:17:56,850
Essentially, some folks I know from college who didn't end up going into health professions do that kind of kind of stuff now.

724
01:17:58,710 --> 01:18:01,860
Anyway, we'll we'll stop here.

725
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:08,670
Dr. BIDDINGER, his lecture will be on Thursday, so I'll continue on this next Tuesday.

726
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:17,129
Like I said, I'll have a canvas announcement, I'll add it. It would be nice if most of us had our cameras on just to like.

727
01:18:17,130 --> 01:18:25,680
So he's not looking at a bunch of blank screens, but he's super cool and I don't know what kind of lecture he's preparing.

728
01:18:25,680 --> 01:18:33,329
I asked him to do mostly personal experiences and photos because I feel like that is like stuff that you won't be able to get from me.

729
01:18:33,330 --> 01:18:38,820
I can give you the logistics. Right. But he's very open to questions as well.

730
01:18:39,150 --> 01:18:49,379
So we're not meeting in here on Thursday. We'll meet over Zoom and then I'll see you back here on Tuesday and then take some milk.

731
01:18:49,380 --> 01:18:52,110
Tea, boba mochi on your way out.
