1
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:27,580
Okay. Good morning, everyone. Uh, we're going again to evolutionary nutrition.

2
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:33,080
We are going to start today's lecture today.

3
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:39,110
Some review of the hereditary material.

4
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:46,330
Something about population genetics that will be useful for you in reading papers and discussing papers.

5
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:56,500
We will talk a little bit about evolutionary theory and then we'll feel we're going to talk a little bit about what we know about human evolution,

6
00:00:56,710 --> 00:01:05,440
that evolution of our species. And also to discuss some of that brilliance that we're asking for today.

7
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:11,950
Okay. This is Stanford and this is our review of the error literate material.

8
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:22,030
I apologize is so frequently material. These are redundant for the module, but I want to do have they call a common baseline for for everyone.

9
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:34,540
Okay. And you remember from your biology classes, we have 23 pairs of chromosomes in our cells.

10
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:43,000
They are exactly the same chromosomes in all that sense within our body.

11
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:51,700
With the exception of experimental source for all of the gametes in general.

12
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:55,390
Now you remember also that we have.

13
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:04,580
22 pairs of outperforms one pair of sex chromosomes.

14
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:12,170
This is the case so far in this particular cartoon type. The character begat the collection of chromosomes in this particular karyotype.

15
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:18,020
E From me you'll see that we have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome.

16
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:26,690
In case of women, we have two x growth and then has to remember the number of chromosomes that we have in our in our cells.

17
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:37,260
Now, in some of our papers, maybe when talking about genetics, you will read, for example, telomere centromere.

18
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:46,220
Then I just want to define those concepts. Now here we have again that 23 pair of chromosomes and that telomeres.

19
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:50,510
Okay. First, the centromere is the middle point.

20
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,180
Kodachrome exactly the middle point.

21
00:02:55,100 --> 00:03:02,270
You'll see, for example, that there are some chromosomes like these one that they have that centromere is a little bit right here to the top.

22
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:14,300
Then we have the chromosome. We are going to have a short arm or a long arm in that the IPS of the arms we have what we would call telomeres,

23
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:20,240
that telomeres, they are just part of the chromosome.

24
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:28,550
They are a sequence of DNA and they tend to to shorten the order.

25
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:42,770
We get some people we have used telomeres as a marker of aging is associated with mortality, mostly cardiovascular mortality.

26
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:47,750
But we know in dating that we are too associated with cardiovascular mortality.

27
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:55,760
Also, you feel that some kind of diets I told you last class about these, a study on working corals.

28
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:00,680
Some traditional diets are associated with longer telomeres.

29
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:07,890
They are here in the tips of the chromosomes.

30
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:19,470
QUESTION Just aren't there like some significant associations of to tumors and like mental decline or cognitive decline?

31
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:25,110
Yes. Also, they are they are associated with again and with aging diseases.

32
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:33,810
But. But I what I remember the strongest association with the atoms.

33
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:47,340
Okay. Now, inside the chromosomes, we are going to have that DNA, the molecule, that DNA that is tightly packed into the chromosomes.

34
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:55,780
Remember the chromosome. They are in the nucleus inside of part of the chromosome, tightly packed.

35
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:58,800
And we are going to have the molecule of DNA.

36
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:10,530
Now, I, as partner for the chromosome, they are certain proteins that help to pack the DNA.

37
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:18,750
Here we have the histones, and if they are also modifications in this protein, histones are associated with certain type of cancers.

38
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:26,069
Also cognitive decline a i also for certain cardiovascular outcomes.

39
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:28,110
Again, we are No.

40
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:36,900
One to discuss histones in this cloud, but we are interested in epigenetic, for example, that would classify here in the school about epigenetics.

41
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:44,800
Okay. Going a little bit deeper into the molecule of DNA.

42
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,900
Remember, we have to change in the molecule that DNA.

43
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:55,060
What we have is a sequence of nucleotides along the DNA.

44
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:02,920
And we have four different nucleotides depending on the particular base that they have.

45
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:09,160
Then we are going just to memorize these four types of base yards.

46
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:19,240
Whether there are any is a one is one is a g teaming is that the cytosine is a C.

47
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,520
They are complementary.

48
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:33,520
Remember that meaning that we have an A in one chain in the long elementary chain we are going to have a theme and g binds to see.

49
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:40,330
Then we're interested in the sequence of base of nucleotides in the molecule of DNA.

50
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:47,080
Somebody knows how many nucleotides we have in that molecule of DNA in humans.

51
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:55,100
Hmm. Five t how many? How long is that the difference?

52
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:00,130
How long I love you is three billions.

53
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:13,360
3 million billions and billions. Yes, three times ten to that nine is that is that is a very long molecule out of it,

54
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:23,649
although we are going to use some of our papers that we are going to discuss in the class on time.

55
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:31,420
We are going to talk about mutations and how they affect the are the proteins.

56
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:36,100
And this is just to remind you that in the nucleus we had the molecule DNA,

57
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:43,990
that molecule of DNA serve as a template for the product of the RNA molecule.

58
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:51,190
You have you got leak in here. Leak. Yeah. 1122 They said there was a leak in the front of the room, maybe that one.

59
00:07:55,710 --> 00:08:00,300
Nope. That's the right idea.

60
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,910
Check those three in the middle. See those flip?

61
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:13,540
That's dry, not dry air, but it's not a very bad one.

62
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:18,970
So I'll come back later. I just want to make sure we didn't have water gushing out right now.

63
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:23,800
Okay. Thank you. You're welcome. Okay.

64
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:28,569
This is the way the genetic information flows into the cell.

65
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:37,120
We have that DNA molecule inside the nucleus. Inside the nucleus, we have that the synthesis of RNA molecules.

66
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:42,280
You see that DNA, they are different types of RNA molecules.

67
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:45,070
Here we are showing the messenger RNA.

68
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:55,689
The messenger RNA goes from the nucleus to the cytoplasm to serve as a template for the production of proteins and that protein,

69
00:08:55,690 --> 00:09:06,400
they are going to have different Bond films. We have antibodies for immune function, we have Resect or we have or among like proteins,

70
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:11,630
insulin, etc. Then they have diversity of functions that if put in proteins.

71
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:22,660
Now, now in the DNA molecule, we are going to have certain amount of genes.

72
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:36,520
Anyone can tell me what is a gene? Visiting.

73
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:46,150
Including regions of the DNA. Yep. No.

74
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,990
Going back to these going back to the feet.

75
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:57,010
You see here that we have had the example of a particular resume that they had then for me to put up particular proteins.

76
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:06,970
Now the question, how many of these regions that we have or how many of the genes we have in the genome to call for proteins?

77
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:20,950
Now, I show this here because this is always for me, these tell us that we have to be humble in class, in what we think we know.

78
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:26,050
And this is the estimated number of genes in the human genome.

79
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:31,360
I could do that across the 90, 60, up to what we know right now.

80
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:37,090
Then in the east, in the middle 20th century, it was thought that we have millions of genes in the genome.

81
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:42,970
People that I would estimate was more than 6 million with genes in the genome.

82
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:49,540
Now, in the early nineties, there was the launch of the Human Genome Project.

83
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:57,940
The Human Genome Project was an international project to sequence the whole human genome to sequence that 3 billion for later.

84
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:01,870
These nucleotides that we built before was launched in the nineties.

85
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,370
Last like ten years. A little more than ten years.

86
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:09,700
The idea started the launch of the human genome.

87
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:17,920
It was estimated that we have been that genome model is 100,000 genes, but you see that the estimate has been decreasing over time.

88
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:24,520
And now it's estimated that we have more or less about 20,000 genes in our genome.

89
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:31,240
Hmm. Now, I want to clarify that these genes are the protein coding genes,

90
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:35,770
meaning that one day are going to have information for proteins because we

91
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:40,629
can control the type of genes in the genomes that only produce RNA molecules,

92
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:54,050
but they don't produce proteins also that say Gene can we will use different type of protein depending on the processing or the messenger RNA.

93
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:57,190
After transcription, then this is some of some estimate.

94
00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:02,590
But again, this is just to remind you that what we know, what we don't know.

95
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:12,280
Okay. This is an important concept because we are going to be discussing in this class about valid genetic evidence,

96
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:15,940
how they are how not to regulation affect the frequency or the values.

97
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:21,610
Now, remember that our chromosomes are impaired.

98
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:28,130
Then in this field we have our pair of chromosomes then.

99
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:33,550
So both are DCT chromosome from our period father and this is the chromosome from our mother.

100
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:44,079
Then in this position is chromosome, we are going to have a particular value analysis, just one or more.

101
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:56,260
Bertram 40 Now because we have chromosomes in pairs, that is possible that both copies of the values are the same.

102
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:59,770
Like in this case, then we have homozygous.

103
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:06,530
Homozygous mean that we had that same ideal in what position can be homozygous or a

104
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:15,850
in this case or a homozygous in this case lowercase a or also we can be heterozygous,

105
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:23,880
meaning that we have differing values. Is was essential and a leader.

106
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:34,290
Now, an important part of that we are going to be discussing in this class is what we call single nucleotide polymorphisms or just isn't it?

107
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:46,710
Now, remember that in that genome we had the sequence of nucleotides represented by these four letters.

108
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:56,880
Now, in one particular position, it's possible that not all subjects in human population had that same nucleotide.

109
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:03,360
We had variation. You'll see, for example, that individual one here has a D in this position,

110
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:16,940
but individual two has a C in that position in the three has T, four or D, but five and six they have C and he had a that phenotype.

111
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:25,320
This is DC if they decide to. These are homozygous homozygous t t and these are the different phenotypes.

112
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:32,790
Then we are going to be discussing in this class these particular type of values that they are called single nucleotide polymorphisms,

113
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:39,209
i.e. just variation in a single position in that, you know, it's estimated that human populations,

114
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:54,030
they have about three medium sized people in the whole genome. Now, because humans, if we take the whole war to randomly based on the same person,

115
00:14:54,400 --> 00:15:04,050
another person at random in the whole world is estimated that they are going to share 99.9% with that DNA sequence.

116
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:09,690
This is only one in about, what, 0.1% that they are want to defer.

117
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:16,350
And you see that snippet that we found, the single polymorphisms that we found in human populations.

118
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:24,600
Okay. Although I wanted to tell you a little bit about.

119
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:34,290
I just show you some tools. How to get information of the frequencies of these single nucleotide polymorphisms.

120
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:39,240
Then again, this is information about that human genome project that was launched in the nineties.

121
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:49,650
In the nineties lasted up to 2020. 2003 was an international project to sequence the whole genome, the whole human genome.

122
00:15:50,280 --> 00:16:04,290
Um, now the, besides all the knowledge that was created by the human genome, also the advanced technology that created,

123
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:15,360
because in fact when the human genome started was estimated that the whole project was going to last like 20 or 30 years to sequence the whole genome.

124
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:23,429
But there was such a balance of technology by the informatics that that project was ended almost in half that time.

125
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:27,900
That was initially full. And now we came.

126
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:40,260
I don't remember the the code for this project, but was in the order of the billions of dollars to sequence the human genome.

127
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:48,570
Now we can sequence ah, I can take you DNA and sequence your whole genome by $1,000.

128
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:55,950
Mm hmm. Now, the price to get the document that sequenced the whole you know, that is going very deep right now.

129
00:16:56,470 --> 00:17:01,200
Hmm. Okay, now what?

130
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:05,730
The objective, that human genome that would do with that human genome was to get the sequence of letters,

131
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:09,150
that sequence of that three billions of letters in the human genome.

132
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:13,340
Here I showed us an example the sequence of the human genome for use with you.

133
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:18,120
Mm hmm. These are the different type of nucleotides in that on that gene.

134
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:22,650
For that, he was willing. Now, why do we care about these?

135
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:29,580
Can you one tell me why do we care about to know in the sequence or that genome or that particular gene?

136
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,200
Can you imagine any any reason why we care about these?

137
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:41,460
This is different from you to me.

138
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:49,020
Yep. Yet they are equally different from my sequence to sequence or to the sequences of any other person.

139
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:55,170
Then it is the insulin, even complete insulin insulin sensitivity analysis.

140
00:17:55,890 --> 00:18:00,550
But this will be related to to insulin sensitivity, you think?

141
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:18,120
Because if there is like a mutation in the gene, it could result in like a different response, like the ability to create insulin or to encode it?

142
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:26,130
Yeah, exactly. They have a different reason why, because it can tell us more about that genetic component.

143
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:33,950
Diseases will be a certain mutation here that maybe are related to maybe insulin.

144
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,990
These are not going to work that is supposed to work.

145
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:44,010
If there is some mutation or maybe even is producing this amount, maybe that is a mutation.

146
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:52,410
One would that there are some regions in that genome that regulate how much the particular proteins produce, how much of bacterium genes produce.

147
00:18:53,070 --> 00:19:05,730
Then it could be a mutation there. Also now there are certain technologies that are still in experimental basis in most of that,

148
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:15,689
well, you know, silicon can analyze, but in theory we can edit the DNA of a person.

149
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:25,440
We can make changes in the DNA and try to at least to if not cure, but at least to ameliorate the severity of disease.

150
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:32,730
Yeah, because these gene sequence before, like when I was born.

151
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,490
Okay. Mm hmm. You look at it, and then later you letter by meeting you look at these again.

152
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:45,690
Are they different in the in these somatic organs can be changed for example

153
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:51,870
because I I what organ they are mutating they then could be so so at least

154
00:19:51,870 --> 00:20:02,880
in cancer that decade that they are told mutation in certain genes they are going let's say because of exposure to you bely or certain carcinogens,

155
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:12,990
then they can change and produce cancer. Now for diabetes, it's a little bit more complicated because there is a strong environmental factor born in,

156
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:18,730
but yet we can imagine there may be some mutations in the insulin being that pancreatic or.

157
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:27,020
In the liver can affect that production of easily more other important type one diabetes.

158
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:31,940
It would be especially if what they'd been they be to have diabetes is more environmentally.

159
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:37,430
But I have seen a reversal of type where I needed to.

160
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:43,040
One day in his day, I had to do some work with the pancreas and the liver.

161
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:47,270
And then they were they stop having to have insulin shots within weeks.

162
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:49,370
There was everywhere.

163
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:59,360
It's reversed yet with the type one diabetes, because the problem with diabetes is that it's not either that you not insulin production,

164
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:06,859
the people is treated with swelling with type two diabetes.

165
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:14,910
The problem is rather that that is no response from that. Usually people produce insulin, but the body is unable to respond to beans.

166
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,479
We are one to discuss in the film.

167
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:24,260
What are the actors about insulin resistance and what are the evolutionary advantages of means of insulin resistance?

168
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:35,060
Now for our class, one of that interest to know in the sequence of that particular genes or genomes is that we can also we

169
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:43,940
can do a comparison between a species and try to see the evolutionary relationship between the species.

170
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:54,230
Now, let me explain you. If you are here, this is the comparison of the DNA sequence or that insulin gene of humans.

171
00:21:56,470 --> 00:22:00,030
Against a different organism.

172
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:05,830
You'll see that now a black that here we had the whole sequence.

173
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:13,220
A black in this position means that as equally taxing as humans the same, the same.

174
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:21,470
You see these spaces here a different color mean that as you can see different for humans.

175
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:28,780
Now here we had the fitting we had depicting animal chain gorilla, orangutan.

176
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:31,850
He was all the way up to a fish.

177
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,930
Although we have some frog here. Chickens.

178
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:39,200
Then what do you see here in this comparison?

179
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:55,250
It like a great deal of conserved regions within the met, within mammals, but that in the more distant you get a house of mouse.

180
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:07,910
But like the there are some know especially for non mammalian creatures that are there's not much conserved creations.

181
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:15,500
Yeah exactly. You see here that the availability of how, how much we share with different invertebrates,

182
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:20,900
these are even invertebrates and you see that at least for that insulin,

183
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:29,210
our gene is very similar to that simple 100% to the chimpanzee, maybe some variation there.

184
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:39,500
And in fact, I think is estimated that our genome is more or less 90, 95% similar to the chimpanzee.

185
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:50,180
But however, we will find their father. You see that all the species of vertebrates that are more different to us now,

186
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:57,170
we can use these to try to understand how evolution has happened within a group of organisms.

187
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:02,840
The closer we are beginning to evolutionary terms,

188
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:13,100
the closer the more similar that are going to be that DNA sequences or that you then using that type of comparisons.

189
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:18,200
Now we are able to see more or less our relationship with other primates.

190
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:32,210
These are different type of primate. These are estimated that the the order of primates originated about 60 to 63 million years ago.

191
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:32,900
In the past,

192
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:50,930
our closest living relative in that infancy is estimated that the line leading to the mother humans underlying the leading to the modern chimpanzees,

193
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:56,360
they separated about 5 to 6 million years ago in the past.

194
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:03,630
Could. You could. Could anyone make Gary's?

195
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:10,580
How people estimate these times.

196
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:24,259
How? Because here we have vacate the land and go to chimpanzee, to humans, separate 6 million primates.

197
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:28,520
They originated about 60 million years ago.

198
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:32,150
How people estimate this time this ages is a mystery to me.

199
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:36,260
Yeah, I don't know. Okay, let's hear what they can do.

200
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:41,959
Some things like looking at, I mean, DNA might not be preserved,

201
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:52,670
but you can look at the phenotype that is expressed in the archeological record, which might be reflective of the genome to affect variation.

202
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:56,870
Mm hmm. You have 180 people in archeological records.

203
00:25:57,110 --> 00:26:00,919
Fossils, bombs, fossils, archeology.

204
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:07,220
Fossils. Yes, because you can you can find that, say, the carbon dating.

205
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:10,340
Exactly. You can use carbon dating. You can use it.

206
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:16,729
And then you can see how how old is a particular quality to then, for example, use what you can see.

207
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:21,290
Okay. What is the oldest fossils that we know of, a private, for example?

208
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:28,970
Then you can get all sense to me. Now, a problem with that fossil is that they need to be conserved.

209
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:39,470
We need to find it, and sometimes we don't. So then we have gaps in the fossil record, but still we use that.

210
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:48,500
Now with that, with that DNA technology, we can sequence, let's say a chimpanzee.

211
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:53,570
We can get that sequence of the chimpanzee, we can get that sequence of modern human,

212
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:59,359
and we can see in how many sites in the genome they are different than.

213
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:05,150
The nice thing is that most of that genome is mutating like a clock.

214
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:20,840
Then we can we can see, we can count how many different points are between two species, and then we can estimate, okay, this is behaving like a clock.

215
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:28,460
That is a mutation rate, for example, of this type of mutation by number of genes.

216
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,940
Then we can go back to the past and we can do our work related to the past.

217
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:35,690
And the CDC could. They were equally the same, for example.

218
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:46,100
That is very interesting. These are a lot of it that these things like informatics to try to estimate these times using DNA.

219
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:52,640
Mm hmm. How much error do they estimate in the mutation, in the constant mutation rate that you've seen?

220
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:58,100
Yeah, that's a good question, because mutation rates, they are not very they are not constant.

221
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:02,150
Exactly. And they came, Barry, from citing that genome to another site on the genome.

222
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:14,920
Now. How they estimate this is the EU, how far along, for example, humans.

223
00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:16,720
You have long pedigrees.

224
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:25,690
Then you can see how many mutations we have in human pedigree or so you have a very good reason for why animals will wipe animals.

225
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:31,360
Now, sometimes you need to use the fossil record.

226
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:41,320
They say you have a pleasant record. That is very good. Then you can compare how the DNA clock compares to the archeological record.

227
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:46,360
But for that, we need to have very, very good archeological fossil record.

228
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:50,380
Is is amazing. Okay.

229
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:54,190
Also, we can use that type of information to compare humans population.

230
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:57,670
Here we are comparing human to other primate species.

231
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:07,360
But also we can do that to compare human populations and to see that relationship between the different humans populations, the city comparison,

232
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:17,170
differing population from different regions, from Africa, the Middle East, Europe, South Central Asia, East Asia, Oceania and the Americas.

233
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:20,560
Then comparing sequences,

234
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:32,589
we can you can group these populations and we can see how they are related to each another just because like obviously we don't we're all one species,

235
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:36,310
so we can like intimate it like that. So how are they?

236
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,570
How are they defining and who qualifies as European?

237
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:45,459
Andrew Kwok Yes, good question here.

238
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:50,470
This is based on the same location.

239
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:55,660
Yeah, well basically both relocation where they select where the participants are from.

240
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:02,260
They some people that move like families move over.

241
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:09,160
Yeah, not exactly. And in fact here in these are let me see if you do see that case.

242
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:12,730
Okay. No, no. Here you see. You see, here we are.

243
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:18,820
The the the place it what they took the sample that is from Europe of Sardinia, the Scania.

244
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:27,700
Now, I think the fertility sample they required that people would have to live there for a certain number of generations to allow for,

245
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:31,749
as are recent migrants. But yeah, but that's completely right.

246
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:36,760
People move around and where went to see the effect of all migrations in any frequencies

247
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:44,510
so that this makes sense because back in Asian culture that we have visitors we also.

248
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:55,930
All these people came from like the South Central Asia is connected to part of the heart of the Middle East.

249
00:30:55,980 --> 00:31:00,360
We have some people coming across the desert.

250
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:05,460
Mm hmm. Yeah, I. You see, in Turkey, for example, you see this.

251
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:10,320
This part of the tree here? Yeah. Is that indigenous populations from America?

252
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:16,530
Yeah, from the Americas. We had that be my India from Arizona, made my year from Central America.

253
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:25,110
So Aboriginal population from Colombia I think got are from Brazil and you'll see that they grew together.

254
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:26,890
Mm. You see that they,

255
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:41,890
they grew up together and they grew close also to population problem Kenya because we went to see later in the today that if the there was a

256
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:55,319
migration from people from Oceania to South America like a 3000 or 5000 years ago before the advent of the economy here now you see people from 18.

257
00:31:55,320 --> 00:32:04,410
These are from East Asia. They grew up together, together, and they grew to us also close to people from South Central Asia.

258
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:13,440
Now, Europeans in Greece, you see that they they grew up together close to people from the Middle East.

259
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:20,340
And these people are migration, software mixing and mixing and African populations.

260
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:25,229
They grew apart from that rest a little bit.

261
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:28,320
The larger land is a part by the ocean.

262
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:33,090
Um, Africa. Now, what do you think?

263
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:38,940
Are these African populations? They. They grew a little bit apart to the rest of the.

264
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:50,800
There's a theory that like that's where humans evolved. Yet we are going to see because I wouldn't be any different from Africa.

265
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:54,670
And then they move up to the rest of the world with us later.

266
00:32:54,880 --> 00:33:01,900
Early on the earth also moved to like the plague years, but we are connected to it somewhat.

267
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:04,240
Asia and Middle East is part of Asia.

268
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:11,260
So is the lands connected where we can actually travel by train to China, to Russia, and from there we go to Europe.

269
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:15,010
So when there's connection, people could actually migrate.

270
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:21,190
Yep, yep. But where went to discuss the type of origin of the human species later today.

271
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:31,030
But yes, I would if species are generated after the continents were together then was up after Pangea.

272
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:37,690
After Pangea. Our species separate it from neighboring study perspective.

273
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:41,270
Our ABC is going to be a very reason why.

274
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:48,760
See? Mm hmm. But. But what? What this is showing is that the African population, they are the oldest population in the world.

275
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:55,570
All this in the evolutionary sense because our data where our species of native.

276
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:05,020
Okay. That was a quick introduction about everything material.

277
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:08,830
Yeah. Okay. You know, who is this person?

278
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:16,510
Darwin. Charles Darwin. Now then we are going to talk now a little bit about evolution by natural selection.

279
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:21,340
Now, Darwin wasn't that wasn't the first person to talk about evolution.

280
00:34:21,910 --> 00:34:23,260
He was just the one that got published.

281
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:37,690
In fact, we were told to find out what that phrase together with voila, to propose the mechanism, the actual mechanism of natural selection.

282
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:42,070
Sorry, the actual mechanism of evolution, that is natural selection.

283
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:48,040
Now, what is evolutionary? Do you remember during biology classes?

284
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:53,650
So way from what you don't like that it changes.

285
00:34:54,710 --> 00:35:01,550
Then we have changes. Evolve, evolve, exact element development.

286
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:06,460
Now any thought about what would you understand about evolution?

287
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:13,000
Let's make it the ultimate driver of the novel.

288
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:19,329
Evolutionary change is mutation, but then natural selection selects for those mutations.

289
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:25,420
That determines whether it stays in the gene sequence or whether it's deleterious.

290
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:30,950
Mm hmm. Yeah, there are several vectors. Genetic drift. Yeah.

291
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:35,650
Yeah. Where went through this genetic data. Okay. So we have changes.

292
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:41,480
And that's the, let's say the that b when we think about evolution, we think about change.

293
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:46,300
But what what kind of changes? Now, here they are. Some definitions according to Darwin.

294
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:52,090
Exactly. And with modification, I mean, in them, the major spring is going to be similar to me.

295
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:58,090
But if you're going to be some difference for me now, there are other definitions.

296
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:06,130
You'll see that, in fact, some of the definition are based in that in frequency, yet that change of frequencies over time.

297
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:14,020
But the important point or the definition or the the overlapping thing or the definition that

298
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:20,560
that we have to change and we have to change over time and we have to change across generations.

299
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:24,969
Then this is a basic mechanism, one that was originally set up very simply.

300
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:32,710
Five. I'm here and for my writing we found all the nuances of natural selection.

301
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:42,640
But the basic idea that we're going to aberration in a certain phenotypic trait in this can be called or size or even behavior,

302
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:49,000
uh, food, behavior, mating bodies.

303
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:56,200
Then we have variation. Now, the important thing that, that Barry is doing is going to that final territory component.

304
00:36:57,820 --> 00:37:06,070
Now, that doesn't mean that the barriers you can have or to a number romantic point then, but at least have to have some genetic component.

305
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:17,620
The other requirement is that that phenotypic trait has an effect of fitness by fitness.

306
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:24,700
From that evolutionary perspective, if differential survival and reproduction, then then in this example,

307
00:37:25,090 --> 00:37:35,140
you'll see that the this little bird is going to prefer to eat green insects than the one with the brown color.

308
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:45,430
They are able to hide in this in this cartoon and they are going to survive and will be more and more likely to reproduce.

309
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:50,320
Now, then, as a consequence.

310
00:37:52,790 --> 00:38:02,120
If there are certain genes associated or other genes that are responsible for to produce that green color,

311
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:12,920
they are going to increase in frequency across time. Now I want to make here several important points.

312
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:17,330
First. Natural selection acts on that phenotype.

313
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:23,390
Natural selection. Okay. Forgive me if I sometimes I use metaphor.

314
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:34,700
Metaphors. But natural selection doesn't see genetic variation is blind to genetic variation.

315
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:38,480
Natural selection is acting on phenotype.

316
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:43,160
Then indirect way is acting on the genes.

317
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:47,780
I understand that. Then that's an important point also.

318
00:38:47,810 --> 00:38:56,300
Now all these genetic variation that we have in population, they come from mutations.

319
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:02,330
Remember, we have that DNA in our cells, that DNA is duplicated.

320
00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:10,850
However, these are not you are free. The accepting mistake that happens during that duplication with that DNA molecule

321
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:19,009
and those mutations are random and they can have phenotypic defect or not.

322
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:22,820
They can be deleterious. They can be beneficial that these harms random.

323
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:33,230
And that we need the selective force to select for an antibody reaction.

324
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:38,270
Then continuing with this definition,

325
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:46,940
then that evolutionary chain may be approaching generations that change the current lifetime of a particular individual.

326
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:54,230
These are not evolutionary change. Then, for example, I'm growing older, so my hair is going to be gray.

327
00:39:55,250 --> 00:40:01,220
That is to know that you are not able to evolve in it in an electric sense.

328
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:09,590
However, however development there see can show it will have to change.

329
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:19,850
I want to discuss that when talking about developmental plasticity that in humans our childhood is longer.

330
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:27,230
For example, that childhood in chimpanzee there has been an evolution of our life stages of our development.

331
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:33,830
An important concept that relate to our people, we feel is not any.

332
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:40,960
And let me explain. What is an LAPD? Okay.

333
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:49,930
This is a salamander. A mexican salamander is is an excellent scientific name.

334
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:54,420
I'm used to my Mexican. I'm here to the left.

335
00:40:54,430 --> 00:41:04,150
We have the development of frog from that fertilized egg to an adult frog.

336
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:09,340
What do you accept? And this is the adult salamander.

337
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:19,540
Whether or what do you see looking at the feet of the adult salamander and that development with that frog.

338
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:26,920
Like the it's still the tail. Like the long tail and that ridge on the spot.

339
00:41:28,810 --> 00:41:33,610
Exactly. We have a variable that we don't observe in the adult frog.

340
00:41:34,090 --> 00:41:46,810
We have some things we have at these gills that we do not observe in the other from that is you observe that in the adult axolotl.

341
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:51,460
They are juvenile characteristics.

342
00:41:53,350 --> 00:42:00,090
Juvenile or John? Yes. They could be like the Devonian stopped before turning to the humpies.

343
00:42:00,130 --> 00:42:09,550
I went also to to make that that the nuance is not that the development is stopped because this is an adult is rather that

344
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:19,240
there are certain characteristics that they don are is that developing a certain characteristics that nobody can adopt?

345
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:27,490
I know you know exactly about them. We have that retention, the juvenile features in the other and this is coloniality.

346
00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:33,790
That type of development is called that retention of juvenile characteristics.

347
00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:41,530
And why do we care about not getting humans?

348
00:42:46,450 --> 00:42:58,030
Now. Let me show you this video here. Had you seen the EU either in TV or VENUSAUR?

349
00:43:00,190 --> 00:43:10,840
Had you seen a juvenile chimpanzee and an adult chimpanzee waiting physically?

350
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:15,700
Which one is more similar to humans? The adult or the baby?

351
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:19,430
Baby. I see the figures.

352
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:28,630
Okay. These are two embryos that chimpanzee embryo, that human embryos to the morally desolate time that he then 25 weeks old now.

353
00:43:30,070 --> 00:43:33,850
But you see that young chimpanzee?

354
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:38,560
The face is similar to our face is flat.

355
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:55,810
The head is larger compared to the body. Also died young chimpanzee similar to the adult human has short arms and legs.

356
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:02,440
They now think humans do it during the ability for humans.

357
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:13,330
We have been having this in the opinion that the reason is slowing of body development in humans compared to other primates.

358
00:44:14,410 --> 00:44:21,470
Now. Before I show you the the the the next slide.

359
00:44:26,390 --> 00:44:37,690
What do you. Oh. From natural selection perspective to what do you think?

360
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:41,050
I honestly feel free to make any hypothesis you want.

361
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:51,710
Why do you think humans. We humans have this neo panic feature where we retain juvenile features.

362
00:44:51,730 --> 00:45:03,040
That's a novelty. I really don't think we we're actually a more advanced creatures, these animals.

363
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:09,700
And even like they stand up right away before us, take some time, some years before you would stand up.

364
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:20,470
And we are like infancy of theirs. Like, their survival capability is much better than we were just.

365
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:24,440
That's what I think I can see. We are developed more developed.

366
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:27,880
I can say that we are more advanced. That's what I'm saying.

367
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:34,780
Okay, let's bear only. Maybe like the additional time you.

368
00:45:39,010 --> 00:45:42,370
Yeah. Brain like the Bible.

369
00:45:42,390 --> 00:45:45,910
Mm hmm. Like longer familial.

370
00:45:48,010 --> 00:45:53,920
Like, children are cared for longer by adults, and therefore, have more time to live.

371
00:45:54,220 --> 00:46:01,690
Mm hmm. Yep. Exactly. And the the apparent reason why for BI at the end has to be related to, for Bible, um,

372
00:46:01,710 --> 00:46:06,370
reproduction, because that the, the, the natural selection for the Bible a reproduction.

373
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:13,840
Now, I barely mentioned, uh, one would be brain remembered that we have a large brain.

374
00:46:14,530 --> 00:46:24,660
Um, um, there is, I think in the selected of our reproduction, we are going to talk about the, uh, the,

375
00:46:24,670 --> 00:46:35,580
our brain keeps growing after birth because there is a physical limitation how, how large our brain can be in cellular models because the,

376
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:46,700
the, the, the process will feel better now that we are more also to discuss the um the even from that genetic point of view of

377
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:55,690
the brain is similar to ah we keep expressing genes in our brain that our genes are most depressing during childhood.

378
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:58,690
We keep learning now.

379
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:12,060
They are also all that period related to Tony or Tony and someone proposal has to be altered with some kind of or sexual selection.

380
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:31,020
We humans are well known for some reason why we we give the juvenile features in in in the adult but from wife after it.

381
00:47:31,350 --> 00:47:41,639
I think the most of that evidence has to be with our capacity of learning that we retain with the

382
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:47,340
the ability to do it to do with still and looking at the life that we would I would bring size

383
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:56,940
then according to global what's up ideologies is easier to use that will say that human evolution

384
00:47:57,510 --> 00:48:04,470
is is characterized by the retaining of adult to adulthood to juvenile features of our ancestors.

385
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:14,730
Now, I'll don't say that you're trained in they believe only humans, that we humans, we prolong our childhood and with that digital maturity.

386
00:48:20,610 --> 00:48:27,209
But but what I'm trying to say is that we want to discuss that the developmental

387
00:48:27,210 --> 00:48:31,980
plasticity that we have had and that we get to them of our childhood stage,

388
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:46,610
of our child to allow us to learn. Now, we also are going to discuss how these are retardation of maturity is going to be related to aging.

389
00:48:47,210 --> 00:48:55,680
One of our lectures is about on J.V. and they were went to discuss how nilotinib can affect also agency in humans.

390
00:48:56,160 --> 00:49:01,100
Questions. Comments about nudity.

391
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:11,520
Now our guest. I guess we're measuring this based on our.

392
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:16,400
What do you value? So.

393
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:24,260
Yeah. It's hard to say, because we each animal evolves to maximize.

394
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:28,139
What? Designed to be. They're designed to be right.

395
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:35,510
So we're very tool makers. So we just maximize. I don't know if at this point we're actually, like, helping ourselves.

396
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:41,860
Technology and actually. Yeah, exactly.

397
00:49:42,030 --> 00:49:48,510
Now, the fact that we have all the, uh, the problem with the.

398
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:58,990
With all of our our technology problems now where all the mental effects, our populations,

399
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:15,610
even the the the type of of weapons that we do to support the wars, then we have the capacity, the capacity to destroy life in the whole world.

400
00:50:15,630 --> 00:50:22,990
And yet that does that that's interesting how aware these are and these I'm and then I

401
00:50:22,990 --> 00:50:30,940
want I want to I want to make this point because remember that the resolution is blind.

402
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:38,740
There is no the the the only goal of natural selection is survival of reproduction.

403
00:50:39,730 --> 00:50:48,900
Then there is no like a perfect end or natural selection, because let's say we are not active to us.

404
00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:51,190
We were abducted to set the temperament.

405
00:50:51,970 --> 00:51:02,860
But if the fundamental change does not act way to be harmful and we are going to discuss about mismatch now also in that

406
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:08,770
even in that in a negative way life you can imagine that certain organisms have acted to the particular environment,

407
00:51:09,310 --> 00:51:11,110
but that is such different environment.

408
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:19,770
Then the maybe the adaptation that that particular organism had is not going to work that can be going extinct also.

409
00:51:20,350 --> 00:51:27,610
Now then what I'm trying to say is that the not selection is only acting in the present.

410
00:51:29,410 --> 00:51:34,240
Is not is not. And again, I apologize for that.

411
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:42,910
Put it that way, that something we enter at the world anthropomorphize but natural selection is no preview in the future.

412
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:46,780
Nothing. Nobody's going to happen in the future. That is only acting implicit.

413
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:53,920
Yeah. What about the idea that, like, if you find something in the future, they just end up killing themselves eventually?

414
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:57,100
Like, there's a theory that, like. Oh.

415
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:05,140
If reproductions like to. You like over itself so that you end up.

416
00:52:06,430 --> 00:52:10,780
Killing your own population? Yep. We have our soldiers.

417
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:14,920
We have finished resources that went to the plate.

418
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:24,400
And I feel that's, again, the reason why we. We humans need to be careful with our environment, because that resources are not infinite.

419
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:34,680
Now. Yes, that's a good point, because not the rest of the game is only acting in the present with trying to maximize survival and reproduction.

420
00:52:37,690 --> 00:52:44,140
Now how that happened, we're going to have to see the differing strategies that the video enthusiast uses in particular humans,

421
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:52,030
that that's the way we have how our our loop it would we can help shape our development.

422
00:52:53,150 --> 00:52:59,550
Now, normally humans are not any new training, although dogs is another example.

423
00:53:00,370 --> 00:53:05,790
Okay, this is an adult dog. You know that that the dogs are under warfare.

424
00:53:05,830 --> 00:53:08,610
They are related. They have a common ancestor. Yeah.

425
00:53:10,690 --> 00:53:19,990
Now, however, the adult, the lap dog is that that behavior is immature compared to an adult, Wolf.

426
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:32,680
And there is less predatory behavior in dog that is not such a clear hierarchy and also they are more playful.

427
00:53:34,410 --> 00:53:45,410
Um, now here I'm comparing this in an adult dog and this see another wolf and this and these these are folks are not these are getting these

428
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:54,610
they have wolf but the juvenile this and you see the adult dog is more similar to the younger wolf because he's in your training.

429
00:53:54,850 --> 00:53:58,710
Now, what do you think, dog? Is they only a failure?

430
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:03,970
What do you think? What are the selective pressures? White dog dogs are now the way they are.

431
00:54:04,090 --> 00:54:12,430
They are domesticated. They are domesticated because we humans have put a lot of pressure on their evolution, because now we because in the past,

432
00:54:15,610 --> 00:54:28,510
our ancestors, they started to your dog, Wolf, initially to our home, to all of us, a company owned by IEEE.

433
00:54:29,530 --> 00:54:32,079
I read and I'm gonna see if I find this paper,

434
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:43,420
but I read the papers a few months ago that basil ignore graphical studies by you can read graph based I mean in the study of while I would in this

435
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:56,530
population in the world that a things that women were the one to put names to dogs women women yes they took names to the dog then that's the

436
00:54:56,530 --> 00:55:06,980
only that in in the past I wouldn't say it's a word that women that that have more to humanize the dogs because just imagine that fact point

437
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:19,350
putting named one or that animal to another being we are somehow from very starting human try to do that to the animal in that case a dog thing.

438
00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:28,150
The the new technique debate I mean the dog has to be because have been domesticated them we have put a lot of pressure putting it on the dogs.

439
00:55:29,140 --> 00:55:34,930
And so the way that we raised the dogs that we want, that we control, we have so much power over them.

440
00:55:34,930 --> 00:55:40,960
We provide the food and the place. And they they had to remain as the children to us.

441
00:55:41,230 --> 00:55:45,309
We have all that control and particularly the one in the middle we love.

442
00:55:45,310 --> 00:55:48,610
Made those dogs to be companions. Yeah. Hunters.

443
00:55:48,610 --> 00:55:52,180
Yeah. They're not exactly know what we have for companions.

444
00:55:52,210 --> 00:55:58,130
No. Okay.

445
00:55:58,910 --> 00:56:08,210
Now then going back to adaptation, the adaptation is just a trait that allow allow an organism to flow, bison reproduce in a particular environment.

446
00:56:09,050 --> 00:56:12,290
Now, remember that adaptation happens to the brain in the present.

447
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:17,870
There is an adaptation right now can be AMIS adaptation in the future.

448
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:24,590
There is another change in the environment. The adaptations are the result of natural selection.

449
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:28,850
Not all current traits of organisms are adaptations.

450
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:37,940
Do you want to take a five minute break? Well, I leave in 5 minutes.

451
00:56:38,090 --> 00:56:43,190
Just to. Yeah. So far away from the washroom.

452
00:56:43,730 --> 00:56:50,230
I know all the bathrooms are under the ways that these rooms.

453
00:56:56,800 --> 00:57:09,660
It's. In terms of like genetics,

454
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:19,770
would that be like you all have the same genes if a gene turns on that in the geographic regions or is it the same genome and just express itself?

455
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:24,450
Yes. Regarding epigenetics, is that, you know, what remains the same.

456
00:57:25,110 --> 00:57:38,100
Okay. And by genome, I mean the sequence of that or the DNA, however, we can have something in that of then that that genome has remained the same.

457
00:57:38,610 --> 00:57:42,900
So how do you know what you mean? Like genetic studies of the genes.

458
00:57:44,730 --> 00:57:52,200
So you see a variation. You mean how do we do genetic studies?

459
00:57:52,710 --> 00:57:56,400
Yeah. If you don't know, they're on. Okay. How can you do this study?

460
00:57:56,940 --> 00:58:07,650
That's a good question, because even in genetics, there is an approach that is called genome wide association studies,

461
00:58:08,430 --> 00:58:18,090
that what we do is are sequenced, let's say the whole genome or at least, you know, type of medium or just neat.

462
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:25,170
And then we have a sample of the same cases as people with breast cancer, people without.

463
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:33,840
And then we compare. Yes. Where they are. Okay. So they have different frequencies in one position, the genome.

464
00:58:34,230 --> 00:58:43,620
How do you know exactly. We don't know that that that that that that that would be the next step because from those studying what we know like these,

465
00:58:43,650 --> 00:58:46,680
they said they have higher frequency of these variants.

466
00:58:47,340 --> 00:59:01,110
Now what that means would be that that balance is regulating the expression or regulating not only not not only whether that is or my not,

467
00:59:01,140 --> 00:59:07,290
also where by where I mean in which organ.

468
00:59:09,660 --> 00:59:15,720
And also being with pain, because there are certain genes that they can change of expression over time,

469
00:59:16,890 --> 00:59:24,180
then it is these is a first step when we see this difference of frequencies is just a first step.

470
00:59:25,050 --> 00:59:30,630
Okay. So you have to go in and study each attribute and see how it develops.

471
00:59:31,230 --> 00:59:34,959
You probably have to have. Yep. I look at my.

472
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:40,350
Yes, we have. I mean, my mom is. Yes.

473
00:59:41,370 --> 00:59:46,620
I was reading a paper a few days ago about diabetes,

474
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:59,320
because we know we know right now I've seen several hundreds of sleep associated with type two diabetes now.

475
00:59:59,730 --> 01:00:03,840
But what is interesting is that the same is the same barrier.

476
01:00:04,410 --> 01:00:15,420
Depending on the time, it can be affecting diabetes because it is present in the liver or in Mosul or even in the brain.

477
01:00:15,930 --> 01:00:19,500
We could bring brain controls, energy homeostasis.

478
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:20,790
Then.

479
01:00:20,790 --> 01:00:32,880
Then it is not only whether that is on and off, it's also weighing in what time would in developing even where in which organ is being expressed?

480
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:37,710
Mm hmm. I think it is is quite complicated, but it's quite interesting.

481
01:00:38,070 --> 01:00:44,290
Yeah, it's a lot of, like, I'm. Yep.

482
01:00:50,450 --> 01:00:55,239
Yeah. Professor.

483
01:00:55,240 --> 01:01:01,640
I actually had something to say, but it was very different from what most of the people in this room.

484
01:01:01,850 --> 01:01:04,730
What I know as a physicist is totally different.

485
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:11,570
So I wanted to say those things, but I wonder if I should say in class or should I say in the office or something like that?

486
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:23,900
Uh, I, I would say because I like having people with different perspectives in class, then I think that, yeah, I have like 3 minutes.

487
01:01:23,900 --> 01:01:26,970
I can share what I know. Yeah, maybe, maybe.

488
01:01:26,990 --> 01:01:30,200
Um, yeah, maybe.

489
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:37,310
Um, yeah. Depending on what you want to do to share with you with a group.

490
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:42,050
But I like having people with different perspectives in approaches to each class.

491
01:01:43,370 --> 01:01:54,830
So in 1990s I was a physicist and 1987 and I came over to university just in computer science because that we needed that to help.

492
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:58,249
We didn't know we were going to go that direction. But eventually,

493
01:01:58,250 --> 01:02:08,629
because our breakthrough in computer science were able to help the biologist to see about the cells and the and that was the breakthrough

494
01:02:08,630 --> 01:02:18,650
during that time that the DNA analysis due to the computer science data processing speed and the capabilities is able to enlist DNA.

495
01:02:18,980 --> 01:02:24,020
And during the 1980s and ah, we were able to develop, you know,

496
01:02:24,020 --> 01:02:33,790
a lot of criminals were released saying that they're wrongly accused because then they they compared to the DNA, realized they did not commit a crime.

497
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:37,550
So that was the breakthrough of our work during that time.

498
01:02:37,940 --> 01:02:41,780
And then and then we went into the air, the deep blue.

499
01:02:42,020 --> 01:02:51,500
And I was right there when they were doing the test. European over time work because I have some colleagues work at NASA.

500
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:58,710
So we hope everybody already know by now that they are angels.

501
01:02:58,730 --> 01:03:09,220
So we know so in our understanding was that we were planted on this planet in the image of our ancestors.

502
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:15,469
I mean, that that's the hypothesis that we were planted by aliens.

503
01:03:15,470 --> 01:03:20,240
Yeah. Is the has is that we kind of of them just because they are the one whose head

504
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:25,400
is really based on the end of the brain is three different types of them.

505
01:03:25,610 --> 01:03:32,030
And we are from that sequence. And then we got upgraded a few times by the virus.

506
01:03:32,180 --> 01:03:37,810
I don't really see viruses, illnesses. We see viruses as a way just to alter our genes.

507
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:45,420
I know about viruses. They have, in fact, in our genome because a virus is able to integrate in our genome.

508
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:52,219
I was actually away then. Our genome is there is there are plenty of viruses.

509
01:03:52,220 --> 01:04:03,170
There is. Exactly. So what we know is like contingently what what what we know is that we have been having it intervened a

510
01:04:03,170 --> 01:04:12,620
few times by the programing through viruses as a way to to inject and reprogram certain part of the DNA.

511
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:23,120
So that's so the revolution that the evolution will happen overnight because we had this virus and now is the sequence is something so different.

512
01:04:23,180 --> 01:04:28,230
It doesn't my understanding that you will get discussing, you know.

513
01:04:28,370 --> 01:04:36,740
So I said, okay, let's continue because I feel still we have a lot to discuss.

514
01:04:37,250 --> 01:04:41,210
They then remember adaptations.

515
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:48,920
They are trade that allow us to authorize and reproduce at the I read the result the translation,

516
01:04:49,250 --> 01:04:56,720
but I want to make a point also that not all our core traits of a particular organism are adaptations.

517
01:04:57,620 --> 01:05:05,719
They are certain trait that they they just can be by product of an adaptation or yes, are not related to not to referendum at all.

518
01:05:05,720 --> 01:05:08,540
And let me give you a couple of examples. Okay.

519
01:05:08,540 --> 01:05:22,970
First, we are going to discuss later today, these are what we call genetic drift, genetic that if that changes in frequency over time due to chance,

520
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:32,839
random variation of frequencies, then it's possible that we are going to have a snips in our genome that they are.

521
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:39,770
No, they had been selected and they are may being a high frequency not due to natural selection just by chance.

522
01:05:39,770 --> 01:05:45,110
And I went to do some exercise today, I hope.

523
01:05:46,850 --> 01:05:50,839
Or we discuss before that degree or divergence.

524
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:53,600
Or divergence or that DNA sequence can be.

525
01:05:53,630 --> 01:06:04,400
You are some molecular clock to try to estimate time for separation want to is busiest now why ability to read.

526
01:06:05,300 --> 01:06:10,520
I remember several years ago people were proposing hypotheses of natural selection why

527
01:06:10,550 --> 01:06:16,340
however a of red and there was all this theory because red is advantageous for such and such.

528
01:06:17,210 --> 01:06:20,360
But really there is no such a thing that.

529
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:27,260
That the color of our blood. Just have a problem with the chemistry of the hemoglobin.

530
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:36,040
Is that because the hemoglobin is red, that our blood is red, but the color opposite hasn't been selected is not that analog.

531
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:46,250
Then this is to tell you that no. Every three is another creation, another concept important.

532
01:06:46,250 --> 01:06:56,600
Consequently, what we call you be able to draw excitation is that that trait that had been initially has of a function bonding.

533
01:06:57,590 --> 01:07:04,610
Let's go opted for another function and the the case of the feathers even bird the ancestral

534
01:07:04,610 --> 01:07:14,899
bird they use song structure similar to feather but rather for insulation and impaired.

535
01:07:14,900 --> 01:07:22,610
Now they are used for flight. Then during the one we film, we can have certain traits that they had the ancestral function,

536
01:07:23,420 --> 01:07:27,050
but now they have another function and this is called expectation.

537
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:38,340
So. Okay. The effect of the effect on natural selection is to change frequencies over time.

538
01:07:40,150 --> 01:07:43,889
Now, now, imagine that here we have three different phenotype.

539
01:07:43,890 --> 01:07:48,120
We had the homozygous H1N1 hormone stereotype cycle.

540
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:52,700
Say, why do these have two different values and are homozygous a two way?

541
01:07:52,710 --> 01:08:02,670
Do they have different thickness? And remember, fitness here are from our purposes represent survival and reproduction.

542
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:14,400
Now is the first genotype that's the highest fitness that eventually the elite everyone is going to be fixated fixed it in the population.

543
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:23,800
By freaks I mean these are frequency 100% is going to be the only added present in the population on the other end.

544
01:08:23,850 --> 01:08:29,280
On the other hand is that genotype 8282 is that one with the highest fitness

545
01:08:30,090 --> 01:08:33,990
they need to be added to the one that is going to be fixed in the population.

546
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:44,070
Now they are so interested in example that rather than heterozygous that one with a higher fitness,

547
01:08:44,250 --> 01:08:47,790
then we're going to have both of these presence in the population.

548
01:08:48,810 --> 01:08:59,670
An example is that the case of the sickle cell anemia, that sickle cell anemia is caused by a mutation in that particular gene.

549
01:09:00,360 --> 01:09:05,550
That is a change of amino acid in that particular position, in that protein.

550
01:09:06,210 --> 01:09:19,680
Now what the what that is going that result in red blood cells they are going to have these are different for because of

551
01:09:19,680 --> 01:09:32,340
that mutation the hemoglobin now they are because of the different form they are prone to block the flow of the blood.

552
01:09:33,390 --> 01:09:38,010
They can process drugs or their articulatory problems.

553
01:09:40,380 --> 01:09:48,990
Also, this type of red blood cell with this mutated will be a table of aging.

554
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:53,460
They are transport oxygen in the list amount.

555
01:09:55,050 --> 01:10:00,990
Now that person that homozygous for this mutation they usually die young.

556
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:13,260
However people heterozygous they're able to survive with treatment with but they are able to survive and reproduce.

557
01:10:14,940 --> 01:10:21,570
And Africa and the Middle East, there is a frequency of about 10% with these mutation,

558
01:10:22,350 --> 01:10:27,150
that mutation and as is equal to the anemia now, it's still heterozygous.

559
01:10:27,270 --> 01:10:32,849
So if they have if they got problems also in getting rid of they didn't want to

560
01:10:32,850 --> 01:10:38,429
be old to die younger compared to people homozygous without the mutation and the

561
01:10:38,430 --> 01:10:44,219
question is why these mutation percent being erased by natural selection because

562
01:10:44,220 --> 01:10:49,470
you set yourself up the mutation caused this anemia problem with separation.

563
01:10:49,950 --> 01:10:55,380
Then why is it in about 10% in Africa, in the Middle East?

564
01:10:56,070 --> 01:11:04,440
You know, this example is because, of course, it confers resistance to malaria.

565
01:11:04,530 --> 01:11:16,350
Yeah. People with these mutations in heterozygous because remember homozygous they usually they will be very severe in homozygous state.

566
01:11:16,590 --> 01:11:25,890
However people heterozygous they are resistant against infection with the markers of malaria.

567
01:11:26,610 --> 01:11:27,670
Then you see that distribution.

568
01:11:27,690 --> 01:11:39,180
They see that if we film that sickle cell anemia and you see that issue with of the of malaria and they too, you see this huge overlap.

569
01:11:39,510 --> 01:11:48,600
Then they see that when we have that, we have the mutation that is causing problem of anemia,

570
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:52,140
however, compared protection against an infectious agent.

571
01:11:54,390 --> 01:12:01,260
Then this is a case where the heterozygous has a higher fitness compared to that homozygous.

572
01:12:05,740 --> 01:12:08,920
Natural selection is a factor affecting all frequencies.

573
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:13,630
The other is our genetic tree and they are all there. But we are going to discuss these to.

574
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:25,730
Let's see, genetic drift. Now, let me read you this example.

575
01:12:26,270 --> 01:12:35,780
Imagine that this is a human population. And now we're going to think no in terms of persons, but rather in terms of police.

576
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:43,610
Then we have two differing ideas red and blue, each one with a frequency of 50%.

577
01:12:47,700 --> 01:12:59,130
Now. Imagine that day that we have a population of our medium of subjects.

578
01:13:03,250 --> 01:13:16,120
Then we can think, okay, I'm going to take a random sampling of a certain number of values to produce up a political family of subjects.

579
01:13:16,660 --> 01:13:21,180
Now, this is the typical example to say you flip a coin, a minimum of two,

580
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:29,560
and then you are able to to get more or less a 5050 hit that takes know exactly 350 to very close.

581
01:13:30,340 --> 01:13:35,860
Now but let's say now you've reached that point just ten times more likely.

582
01:13:35,860 --> 01:13:44,580
It's quite possible that you get six up, four even you can get three and saving that you repeat that experiment many times

583
01:13:44,590 --> 01:13:49,720
eventually you calling because you are went to objective probabilities every time.

584
01:13:50,510 --> 01:13:55,120
Then eventually your goal is only to get heads or it's only going to get tails.

585
01:13:56,050 --> 01:14:00,800
You definitely that coins of a small number of times that this can happen.

586
01:14:00,850 --> 01:14:05,080
Humans do. We have a population with a small sample size.

587
01:14:06,620 --> 01:14:15,080
It's quite possible that some of the aliens that want to disappear during time by chance, not related to natural selection by chance.

588
01:14:17,870 --> 01:14:23,180
Then what are going to observe? These are some simulations.

589
01:14:24,650 --> 01:14:29,240
Okay, this is not fair with that. With about them. This is a population of 2000 subjects.

590
01:14:29,900 --> 01:14:37,010
Each color line represent a population. Then we have here a different number of population.

591
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:40,130
They just start from 50% that in frequency.

592
01:14:40,820 --> 01:14:46,430
And you see that we are going to have some variation over time, but they remain more or less around 50%.

593
01:14:47,990 --> 01:14:53,020
Now we have some differentiation because you see that they are the aligned, they tend to deviate from the others.

594
01:14:53,030 --> 01:14:57,140
But this is still, as you said, some more differentiation for the population of the population.

595
01:14:58,820 --> 01:15:03,530
We have to candidate population size.

596
01:15:04,310 --> 01:15:07,370
You'll see that that divergence is bigger.

597
01:15:10,040 --> 01:15:13,160
We have a small population size, just 20 subjects.

598
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:23,450
You'll see that in some cases 1 million is going to be fixed, meaning we can have frequency 100% of that cases.

599
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:36,290
The other elite is going to be fixed. Then one of the effects of genetic drive is that populations are going to be fair but just by chance.

600
01:15:37,550 --> 01:15:39,560
And this is a DC planning consent.

601
01:15:39,560 --> 01:15:47,200
Quite important because we can observe difficult in frequency from one population to the other and they are not related to natural selection.

602
01:15:47,210 --> 01:15:58,670
They are just because of random variation. Now this is an okay then this have a tool to explain the same concept.

603
01:15:59,240 --> 01:16:09,440
Here we have two populations with if you read them blue, you'll see in these two populations they had the same number of blue and red.

604
01:16:10,130 --> 01:16:15,680
Then there is no differentiation that is that measure in genetic that we call that

605
01:16:15,680 --> 01:16:22,100
if statistics that measure the degree of differentiation between populations.

606
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:26,510
In this case we have zero because they are exactly the same frequencies.

607
01:16:28,970 --> 01:16:37,400
Here. You'll see the differences now in this. In population two, we have more values in the population while we have more blue valleys.

608
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:45,290
In the extreme case, population two is only Ridley's population.

609
01:16:45,290 --> 01:16:49,060
One is only blue areas that we have yet 100% efficiency ratio.

610
01:16:49,310 --> 01:16:51,500
Then don't pay attention to the situation.

611
01:16:51,980 --> 01:17:01,280
Yes, this is the degree of genetic differentiation can be from zero, meaning that both population and it's actually the same or one 100%.

612
01:17:01,550 --> 01:17:05,270
I mean, the population, they have the different frequencies.

613
01:17:07,260 --> 01:17:16,319
Now in the in today's model, there isn't a spreadsheet called trip simulation.

614
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:19,810
I don't know whether you will. Do you see it? Yeah.

615
01:17:20,250 --> 01:17:32,790
Then you can do this exercise at home. I'm going to have to do it here to show you the conflict of genetic drift that I already have here.

616
01:17:39,670 --> 01:17:45,190
Okay. Here, I have that spreadsheet.

617
01:17:45,670 --> 01:17:49,660
Feel free to download it. And you can do this exercises in class.

618
01:17:51,460 --> 01:17:56,100
Now, what I have here are ten different populations. Population one up to ten.

619
01:17:58,030 --> 01:18:06,550
And you? I can I can select actually sample size and the initial and frequencies that I'm going to keep

620
01:18:06,970 --> 01:18:14,650
0.5 meaning that we have to either use 50 50% and select a population size of a thousand.

621
01:18:17,320 --> 01:18:20,890
Okay. Yeah, click end there. Let me play the results.

622
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:27,190
The older population, you'll see that they use that with 50% added frequency.

623
01:18:28,090 --> 01:18:37,320
But over time I lose population one the alleged changes to 54%, population 2 to 57%.

624
01:18:37,330 --> 01:18:46,330
I'm going to make this a little bit larger, but you'll see that they remain model is around 50%.

625
01:18:48,870 --> 01:18:59,340
Now in this field that we have here, this act that even in populism across 20 generations, you'll see that we have differentiation that is the model.

626
01:19:01,080 --> 01:19:05,670
And you see that if is to remember this FTT, that you create differentiation.

627
01:19:06,690 --> 01:19:18,840
Now, what do you observe here? What is that trend of the FSD over time to increase more or less in a linear way, it's not widely respected.

628
01:19:21,030 --> 01:19:26,580
Now, why this is useful? Because we have been used to.

629
01:19:27,570 --> 01:19:38,100
I think I think that the first guy I told you about my about yesterday did in Costa Rica during my my thesis to study how about a unique

630
01:19:38,160 --> 01:19:45,890
population in Costa Rica the iwamoto the approach I used because then I compare Italian frequencies between different abo regions,

631
01:19:45,910 --> 01:19:50,190
drive in Costa Rica and Panama to compare differentiation.

632
01:19:50,370 --> 01:19:54,689
I was able to feed and see how, how, how far away.

633
01:19:54,690 --> 01:20:04,560
In the past they were a single population. Then to estimate when these try fares where are settled in Costa Rica.

634
01:20:05,320 --> 01:20:12,750
Now we estimate 3000, 5000 using the past. Then this type of study people use using anthropology, genetics, population,

635
01:20:12,750 --> 01:20:18,570
genetics to try to see the way population in fact it would be very different from the other.

636
01:20:21,300 --> 01:20:27,390
Okay if I now right here 100.

637
01:20:32,020 --> 01:20:36,250
You'll see that there is higher differentiation and in fact efficiency.

638
01:20:36,790 --> 01:20:40,390
You will see that the continuous India scale is going to be stronger.

639
01:20:43,030 --> 01:20:49,680
Now, what I want you for you here is you can do this in home.

640
01:20:51,490 --> 01:20:55,600
I do this exercise and you'll get you are better.

641
01:20:55,600 --> 01:21:03,580
Understand the concept of genetic drift. Then if I you have this table, then you need to complete this table.

642
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:11,620
You don't need to give me these. You can do it at home. Can anyone looking?

643
01:21:12,760 --> 01:21:16,290
Let's see here. This is about relation with your population.

644
01:21:16,300 --> 01:21:19,480
Between then what you need to do.

645
01:21:20,050 --> 01:21:24,670
You have to take these numbers and put it here in the table.

646
01:21:25,300 --> 01:21:28,390
Which number? Okay, let me show you. Let's.

647
01:21:28,390 --> 01:21:36,430
Let's start with a thousand. Then with a thousand, I have 0.25.

648
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:42,310
These these are number here in the bottom. You'll see by region within this example, that variation within populations.

649
01:21:42,790 --> 01:21:45,900
Mm hmm. Then with the.

650
01:21:45,940 --> 01:21:50,050
It would be 0.25. I'm going to round to decimal point.

651
01:21:51,580 --> 01:21:56,350
This is 0002. You see that it is.

652
01:21:57,610 --> 01:22:10,690
Then the total you've got, the sun is about 0.25 and that FC is about I'm going to press that in percentage.

653
01:22:11,630 --> 01:22:14,860
You multiply by a hundred these 0.8%.

654
01:22:22,050 --> 01:22:28,320
Now most likely you are going to get differing numbers because this is a random simulation that you're not going to get exactly these numbers.

655
01:22:28,680 --> 01:22:38,850
But that train has to be this should be the same. Then if I put up a hundred here, I guess going to put that fsd, you see that now I have 1.9%.

656
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:44,310
I'm just going to put this here. And with them.

657
01:22:49,220 --> 01:23:08,570
I got. Whoa. 80%. Now let me show you with the extreme case, you'll see that in population two, we are starting with 50%,

658
01:23:08,910 --> 01:23:15,360
but after 12 generations we have 100%, meaning that one value was completely lost in the population.

659
01:23:16,350 --> 01:23:19,410
In population five, where? In population four? What the other way.

660
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:23,370
You got it. The other than it was lost. And you'll see that graph here.

661
01:23:23,460 --> 01:23:34,300
You see the huge differentiation. Mm hmm. Now, regarding I going to do about evolution, now I can play around with this.

662
01:23:34,590 --> 01:23:39,660
You don't need to game to game about the table. Just play around and complete that table at home.

663
01:23:43,940 --> 01:23:53,450
Oh. In the second. Okay.

664
01:23:58,890 --> 01:24:06,850
Just want to make sure the recording done right. Okay.

665
01:24:07,990 --> 01:24:11,020
Looking again completely in your tongue.

666
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:26,710
Now related to genetic drive, the topic of migrations we hear about, we move from one place to the other, and we had done that even if we were humans.

667
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:32,590
Our ancestor did it and we are still doing it. Migrating from one place to the other.

668
01:24:32,830 --> 01:24:37,030
Now how migration happens.

669
01:24:37,810 --> 01:24:45,400
I mean, let's say if I decide to move from one place to the other to one country to the other.

670
01:24:45,940 --> 01:24:50,740
Now what do you see in this group? They are just random subjects.

671
01:24:51,850 --> 01:24:57,610
They are related how people move from one place to the other, how they migrate.

672
01:24:57,970 --> 01:25:01,660
They're really the unrelated. They are family groups.

673
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:12,160
And then when our ancestors moved from one place to zero, there were family groups of family.

674
01:25:12,160 --> 01:25:19,030
We carried our genes. Then you can imagine the movement of people if movement of genes.

675
01:25:20,770 --> 01:25:26,800
Then we have a family group with certain invariants moving from one place to the other.

676
01:25:28,090 --> 01:25:34,990
Then if that was the same small family group, the effect of genetic drift is going to be very strong.

677
01:25:36,100 --> 01:25:43,600
Then that could be possible. Then they were going to have certain population that they are going to have a certain ideal frequency.

678
01:25:43,990 --> 01:25:48,700
Because of that, what we call from that effect, plunder the frontier.

679
01:25:49,420 --> 01:25:58,870
The people that you are reunited, move to that place. Now, this is what we know about our migration among humans.

680
01:26:01,390 --> 01:26:13,270
Now, what if species coordinated in Africa is estimated at about around 60,000 useable humans?

681
01:26:13,290 --> 01:26:28,510
It started to move out of Africa, you see, and they expand very quickly through Europe, through Asia, to Oceania, to the Americas.

682
01:26:30,430 --> 01:26:37,450
The range of estimation for people moving to the Americas is about 15 to 20000 years in the past,

683
01:26:39,400 --> 01:26:43,810
through the disconnection between Siberia and Alaska and the Bering Strait.

684
01:26:45,100 --> 01:26:57,250
However, also there was an expansion from emigration from Polynesian group to the South America in between 3000 to 5000 years ago.

685
01:27:04,130 --> 01:27:16,880
Now I want a species originating in Africa around 200,000 years ago, meaning that it remains in Africa more than 100,000 use countries.

686
01:27:17,420 --> 01:27:25,639
Yeah, because the audience idea about 200,000 years in the past and it started to migrate out of Africa 60,000 using that.

687
01:27:25,640 --> 01:27:33,230
But then there was the it was time for change, if you will, which 100,000 used in Africa before moving to another part of the world.

688
01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:38,480
How do they how do they get there? Walking. Walking.

689
01:27:41,490 --> 01:27:44,430
Now again, that's a point I want to make.

690
01:27:45,030 --> 01:27:53,320
This moment of of of of people are is going to resolve on differentiation of high frequencies for our interest.

691
01:27:54,690 --> 01:27:57,790
These are elites associated with obesity in modern humans.

692
01:27:57,840 --> 01:28:07,630
This is these are modern humans. And these are different human populations from Africa, Europe, South Asia, East Asia and Americas and green and red.

693
01:28:07,650 --> 01:28:12,690
What they means is just different frequencies. Then you'll see that different populations,

694
01:28:12,720 --> 01:28:20,549
they had differing frequencies of obesity related values in certain genes are

695
01:28:20,550 --> 01:28:25,300
more frequent one population than the others because of the differentiations.

696
01:28:27,630 --> 01:28:34,380
Let me see if I have time for these, because I want to discuss what we know about human.

697
01:28:36,770 --> 01:28:41,930
How about human populations? Okay.

698
01:28:42,320 --> 01:28:48,590
I'm going to do this because I think this is too this beautiful for you.

699
01:28:48,920 --> 01:28:53,480
You are interested in genetics. The SD seemed out.

700
01:28:57,490 --> 01:29:05,590
Okay, let's do this, because I'm more interested to talk about human evolution, that that is exercise than if I have to I will get back to this.

701
01:29:09,170 --> 01:29:12,190
Let me then move to that to human evolution.

702
01:29:13,220 --> 01:29:18,240
Oh, now. Again.

703
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:30,570
The line leading to our lips is separated from the line leading to the chimpanzee.

704
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:39,020
Again, we are seeking medium of usable our closest living relative, the chimpanzee.

705
01:29:42,020 --> 01:29:48,150
Now the line leading to humans or this group is what we call hominins.

706
01:29:49,560 --> 01:29:53,570
We are the only living hominins right now in Earth.

707
01:29:53,790 --> 01:29:58,780
All the other have been. They are already extinct. We don't know now.

708
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:04,590
We don't know yet the exactly relationship between all the different hominin between then and between us.

709
01:30:06,970 --> 01:30:11,190
The I feel the strong.

710
01:30:11,370 --> 01:30:16,320
I wouldn't even even I even we don't know.

711
01:30:17,970 --> 01:30:27,000
Homo sapiens, whether originated from Homo erectus or there is other species of hominids.

712
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:37,709
Then this relationship arrested and. Now comparing hominins are the chimpanzee.

713
01:30:37,710 --> 01:30:46,350
You'll see that they are. They are difference. Again, all these are extents except our species.

714
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:53,700
And this is the chimpanzee. You see that they are different regarded that brain size in hominins.

715
01:30:53,880 --> 01:31:03,900
Hominins there was an increase of brain size. Also did people or walking chimpanzee tend to walk by little below in four legs?

716
01:31:04,410 --> 01:31:08,490
Even they are sometimes they walk in two legs, but most of the time they walk.

717
01:31:08,610 --> 01:31:13,170
They use the legs 2 to 4 to to move.

718
01:31:14,490 --> 01:31:18,420
Being hominins, there was rather evolution to use two legs.

719
01:31:20,220 --> 01:31:30,660
You see the differentiation that the teeth, the canine did, they tend to be shorter and also the wet.

720
01:31:30,690 --> 01:31:36,510
We live with only a few trees that chimpanzees live in three states.

721
01:31:36,540 --> 01:31:41,820
Their bodies are not boreal species based on the fossil record.

722
01:31:42,120 --> 01:31:47,940
We know that's also the extinct hominins that they were frequently living.

723
01:31:48,360 --> 01:31:57,290
They were Boreas. Now, in the past there was this theory, these theories, etcetera, etcetera.

724
01:31:57,480 --> 01:32:01,320
Right now we know that this is not the case.

725
01:32:01,320 --> 01:32:09,740
I just presented this story by historical reasons, but there was this theory about the origin of our species.

726
01:32:09,750 --> 01:32:14,260
It was called regional evolution. And what was this theory proposed?

727
01:32:14,260 --> 01:32:25,290
That what if Homo sapiens originated from Homo erectus then but Homo erectus migrated to Europe.

728
01:32:25,530 --> 01:32:30,899
Okay, Homo erectus are order unit in Africa and migrated to Europe,

729
01:32:30,900 --> 01:32:37,740
Africa and Asia in different we use independently homo sapiens originated then the

730
01:32:37,740 --> 01:32:43,770
hypothesis proposed that they would have species originated in different places in Europe,

731
01:32:43,770 --> 01:32:48,120
in Africa, in Asia and then mix between them. Now we know that this is not the case.

732
01:32:51,860 --> 01:32:59,060
The replacement from Africa propose that our species, homo sapiens, originated in Africa.

733
01:33:00,260 --> 01:33:05,990
We don't know what our ancestor are, whether Homo erectus was in their intelligence.

734
01:33:06,110 --> 01:33:08,120
We don't know exactly this relation yet.

735
01:33:08,690 --> 01:33:19,760
But what we know is that I would if species of unity in Africa are not around 200,000 years in the past and after that,

736
01:33:20,180 --> 01:33:27,020
around 50,000 years in the past, it started to move out of Africa to the rest of the world.

737
01:33:28,310 --> 01:33:38,240
Of course, there were some mixing between Homo sapiens with differing hominids, though, live at that moment that now they are extinct.

738
01:33:40,550 --> 01:33:45,770
Do you read the papers about ancient DNA? Mm hmm. Ancient DNA?

739
01:33:45,780 --> 01:34:02,780
Yes. A technique to study the DNA of these ancient specimens bombed mummified tissues there because people when working with ancient DNA.

740
01:34:03,080 --> 01:34:14,390
People need to be aware of with contamination. I remember there was a case that a person in the lab by mistake contaminated the sample.

741
01:34:14,540 --> 01:34:20,060
Is it possible you took the sample, your saliva you use, you unable to get contaminated sample,

742
01:34:21,140 --> 01:34:27,950
and then that DNA that you're going to analyze is no doubt that the ancient DNA was rather your company.

743
01:34:28,310 --> 01:34:33,110
That has to be very careful. This you have to do that, this isolated of your blood.

744
01:34:33,110 --> 01:34:41,570
You have to have to have these are like an astronaut because they are very, very careful techniques.

745
01:34:41,930 --> 01:34:54,860
Now, what this technique has, us being beautiful for us, is that now we are able to start from extinct species regarding our own species,

746
01:34:54,860 --> 01:35:00,590
our own evolution, the oldest ancient DNA that had been analyzed.

747
01:35:00,650 --> 01:35:05,670
You prove that Neanderthal nerdiness paid them more than 400,000 years.

748
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:16,370
That sampled that more than 400,000 years. Then comparing that sequence to our Florence sequence from other humans, we are able to to compare.

749
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:24,320
How would later we are. This example you wrote about at the fitting is the values of ancient DNA.

750
01:35:26,540 --> 01:35:36,320
Now you see that paper. Now, let me explain to you, because this is very important and the heart this has to be with that makes genetic mixing.

751
01:35:37,850 --> 01:35:42,550
Suppose that some time in the past we have two different population,

752
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:48,220
one represented for that laboring chromosomes and another population represented by that dark

753
01:35:48,230 --> 01:35:58,400
green chromosomes that you start to mix in that current day after many generations of mixing,

754
01:35:58,550 --> 01:36:07,220
our chromosomes are going to be these type, but mostly X. And this is that with our promise we had a segment from chromosome 24 and population for

755
01:36:07,460 --> 01:36:15,470
our depending on sisters then using technologies of DNA sequencing statistical techniques,

756
01:36:16,250 --> 01:36:21,920
we are able to estimate, okay, how frequency are the like hearing fragments,

757
01:36:22,430 --> 01:36:28,220
how frequent are that are green fragments depending on the length of that new fragment,

758
01:36:28,610 --> 01:36:36,769
how long in the past that mixing to start it and that type of questions that using

759
01:36:36,770 --> 01:36:44,870
those ideas people are being able to identify mixing of near dental with humans.

760
01:36:47,240 --> 01:36:55,160
I think one of the papers I don't remember how we proportion with the mother humor you know from the and the.

761
01:36:58,150 --> 01:36:59,200
It's about two person.

762
01:37:04,010 --> 01:37:13,639
Now that this little line needed to mother a few months is estimated that we separated from 13,000 from this other type of meaning that he

763
01:37:13,640 --> 01:37:22,070
saw one and then he saw that because that these sample these teeth was found in a in a cave in Siberia in this region that he saw them.

764
01:37:24,410 --> 01:37:32,290
But what we know is that that I would specious our mother homo sapien mix in the past would now be.

765
01:37:36,330 --> 01:37:46,830
Now. And this is more or less the evidence that we know so far that the split between Neanderthals and modern humans happened around that time.

766
01:37:47,910 --> 01:37:52,620
500,000 years, 4 to 7000 years in the past. 700,000 years.

767
01:37:52,620 --> 01:37:55,920
In the past. DNA identical.

768
01:37:58,260 --> 01:38:03,900
That is genetic presence in a fight at the Far East and with their Siberia.

769
01:38:05,220 --> 01:38:10,320
Based on genetic analysis, you see that they are happy to live in this modern route.

770
01:38:12,150 --> 01:38:17,040
They had a high degree of inbreeding because people that study the DNA that they are

771
01:38:17,040 --> 01:38:22,019
able to do showed that there was a high degree of inbreeding mating between siblings,

772
01:38:22,020 --> 01:38:24,840
Uncle Annie's grandfather, to their granddaughters.

773
01:38:26,670 --> 01:38:35,010
But what we don't still know are our relationship with Daniel Dental, other than his Solon setting analysis,

774
01:38:35,010 --> 01:38:44,040
which is that we are closer to the our dental or that analysis would get that rather narrowed that and then sold on our closest between them.

775
01:38:44,550 --> 01:38:55,410
Now remember that it's not only analytic species, he said, really esteemed and that name because some sample have been found the original Siberian.

776
01:38:59,480 --> 01:39:10,370
Now to summarize what we know now, the evidence suggests a single origin within Africa between 100 to 200000 years in the past.

777
01:39:10,820 --> 01:39:19,090
However, it is possible that there was multiple region of orient within Africa that we see in Africa.

778
01:39:19,100 --> 01:39:25,730
What is so united in dividing us in different places is that it could be a possibility.

779
01:39:25,850 --> 01:39:37,400
But inside Africa, or at least possible that within Africa I would, if pieces or to mix with another communities are really pressing in Africa.

780
01:39:39,460 --> 01:39:43,240
We started to move out of Africa between 52,000 years ago.

781
01:39:44,140 --> 01:39:48,970
Is it still unclear? The number of migrations of waif up out of Africa?

782
01:39:52,280 --> 01:39:59,660
Also, we know that we are mixing with the Argentines mostly.

783
01:40:00,560 --> 01:40:04,430
You see, shortly after this battle, if you remember this figure.

784
01:40:10,090 --> 01:40:17,800
Okay. In this region, in the Middle East, we seem to have been most of that mixing between modern humans and the Arab impulse.

785
01:40:30,110 --> 01:40:39,410
So my estimation I've shown that our genome no African human population because remember that missing copy after that migration out of Africa,

786
01:40:39,830 --> 01:40:49,100
then the 2% of our total DNA is found in non African human populations and.

787
01:40:52,030 --> 01:40:55,740
It doesn't fit your question so far.

788
01:41:00,070 --> 01:41:04,870
42%. Where do they come from? That 2%.

789
01:41:05,110 --> 01:41:12,700
Because comparing the DNA from these ancient samples from adult animal that humans

790
01:41:13,270 --> 01:41:18,040
we can see how which proportion the genome is present in our foreign genome.

791
01:41:18,570 --> 01:41:23,290
And these in these old 2%. But they're not from Africa.

792
01:41:23,710 --> 01:41:27,970
No, no, that's not. Those are from the album because obviously.

793
01:41:28,120 --> 01:41:38,230
Mm hmm. Questions. Now to finish, I want to show you these, because I think this is this is more beautiful.

794
01:41:45,470 --> 01:41:50,570
Now in our genome. This is not the issue.

795
01:41:50,870 --> 01:41:59,180
It's just an app that has that identifier. But when people describe this as need, they put it into fire and they certify it.

796
01:41:59,190 --> 01:42:02,290
It is for our race accepting number, they say.

797
01:42:02,420 --> 01:42:08,010
And then they see they see how particularly steep there is in chromosome three now has two added.

798
01:42:08,210 --> 01:42:21,290
And then let me show you, if you go to this page, you look to this page and give me 1/2 and I'll go and copy and paste.

799
01:42:30,910 --> 01:42:36,340
Okay. In this paper, you can get added frequency for different for different snips in the genome.

800
01:42:37,090 --> 01:42:41,410
Then you can anyone tell me that the number I raised 180.

801
01:42:42,670 --> 01:42:52,510
You had to select 128212821 180 1282.

802
01:42:53,080 --> 01:43:02,650
Okay, then. Then we used these to get that in frequencies.

803
01:43:03,220 --> 01:43:06,910
He said it would be the press going up. Yep. Is running.

804
01:43:07,540 --> 01:43:11,890
Oh, it's just a little internet connection.

805
01:43:16,550 --> 01:43:20,870
I'm assuming. Yes, he's running. I see a little circle here.

806
01:43:29,140 --> 01:43:33,730
Okay. Now you get to this page and you'll see different options.

807
01:43:33,790 --> 01:43:35,650
You click here population genetics.

808
01:43:36,370 --> 01:43:43,990
You are going to get the added frequency, but that is the different human populations, people that done this in different populations.

809
01:43:44,620 --> 01:43:48,520
And then this is the whole population that have been sampled in these studies.

810
01:43:48,880 --> 01:43:55,030
This is from Africa. This is the Americas is Asia, Europe, South Asia.

811
01:43:55,810 --> 01:44:04,410
Now you see. Da da da da da. I you in Africa is only 1% that really.

812
01:44:04,690 --> 01:44:08,290
These are indigenous population, not from this population from the Americas.

813
01:44:08,290 --> 01:44:12,520
About with their. You can say see is about 3%.

814
01:44:13,090 --> 01:44:16,210
Europe 12% and 12%.

815
01:44:16,690 --> 01:44:24,880
Now what is interesting is that this is protected against diabetes, type two diabetes.

816
01:44:24,940 --> 01:44:32,290
Then we have an earlier that is protective against type two diabetes has different frequencies in different populations.

817
01:44:32,770 --> 01:44:36,040
Now, what would be due to natural selection in the past?

818
01:44:36,670 --> 01:44:38,500
What would be the random genetic drift?

819
01:44:39,220 --> 01:44:47,410
The area to get is that random genetic drift data and that is the difference at least for this year, 2016 due to random drift.

820
01:44:52,970 --> 01:44:56,060
Okay. This is this is what we've done. And to finish.

821
01:44:58,220 --> 01:45:01,580
I go back to go to to rethink natural selection.

822
01:45:02,930 --> 01:45:10,100
There are different genes in the genome that have been under natural selection that we know so far.

823
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:19,160
One is the lactase gene. People with variation between certain barriers and they are they have lactase persistence.

824
01:45:20,030 --> 01:45:25,220
Then they are able to drink dairy to dairy without problems during adult life.

825
01:45:26,120 --> 01:45:29,810
Are this particular gene is associated with like skin pigmentation?

826
01:45:32,090 --> 01:45:44,590
They are. This is the is. And you can you can find it in the page they show you and you see that dog ideal that of very recent history.

827
01:45:45,020 --> 01:45:48,259
Yeah. That really sort of. Yes. No, no. Yeah.

828
01:45:48,260 --> 01:45:59,630
The area that has that frequency of 100% in Europe that is associated with lighter skin has been their natural selection,

829
01:46:00,620 --> 01:46:02,930
I think is more highly frequent in Europe.

830
01:46:04,400 --> 01:46:11,030
That is evident that this is related to people living in ordinary may feel they need a lighter skin because that seems to bite.

831
01:46:11,030 --> 01:46:19,130
I mean, the thing is, one example of natural accidental acting in this particular sleep that I want to finish there,

832
01:46:20,060 --> 01:46:23,360
you can do this exercise in class. I mean, at home.

833
01:46:24,260 --> 01:46:28,300
That is a homework for next Monday is you.

834
01:46:28,660 --> 01:46:32,810
Let let me go briefly to the homework before we finish.

835
01:46:33,080 --> 01:46:37,130
I'm going to post the homework just after class, but.

836
01:46:40,970 --> 01:46:46,910
These are nothing to worry about. Define these terms.

837
01:46:49,400 --> 01:46:52,790
Upward film about natera's electromagnetic drive. Hmm.

838
01:46:53,420 --> 01:46:58,730
What do you think will be the how do you think that if we're going to affect the stream and that the resurrection, that that.

839
01:46:58,970 --> 01:46:59,840
That's a good question.

840
01:47:00,590 --> 01:47:09,650
And the third question you get this study will be about how the study of ancient DNA has contributed to our knowledge of human evolution.

841
01:47:10,230 --> 01:47:16,730
And you can find these in this paper, all of what we discussed today then that that's all for today.

842
01:47:18,050 --> 01:47:24,740
So we they have to run at the end and then again before we leave.

843
01:47:26,830 --> 01:47:33,860
Okay. I think we have I posted some guide discussion for next week because next week we start

844
01:47:33,910 --> 01:47:41,569
the student presentation making sure that we talk a little bit offline and if we've got,

845
01:47:41,570 --> 01:47:44,690
we do that protected. Okay. I will see you next Monday. Thank you.

846
01:47:44,960 --> 01:47:50,390
As always, send me questions. Email about the class, about anything.

847
01:47:51,050 --> 01:47:54,380
I will see you next night. Thank you. You're welcome.

848
01:47:56,150 --> 01:47:56,530
Give me one.
