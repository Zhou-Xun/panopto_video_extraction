1
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:10,670
Yeah. Yeah, right.

2
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:40,200
That. Yeah. Thank you so much for being with us.

3
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,480
I'm also my grandma, so we're underground.

4
00:00:45,750 --> 00:01:00,690
So, I mean. I did it in a way.

5
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:45,450
I mean, this is you know, this is really small business.

6
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,650
So good morning, everyone. Let's go ahead and get started.

7
00:01:54,670 --> 00:02:02,440
Can you hear me okay? It's a little tough talking with the mouth, but I'll make sure you protect yourself.

8
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:09,250
And obviously, if you can't hear, just speak up. So welcome to HBCU 641.

9
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,120
Um, my name is Minal Patel. I'm your instructor for the course.

10
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:21,250
And what we're going to do today is I want to do just a brief introduction to sort of put this course into context with the field,

11
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:29,160
and it'll be very brief. And then, um, I want to get, to, uh, get to know you guys a little bit and for you to know each other.

12
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:31,210
Many of you probably already know each other,

13
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:40,870
but it's always good to just do introductions and get on the same page and then we'll go through, um, of course, logistics and expectations.

14
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:44,889
I published the canvas site last night. Maybe you had a chance to look at it.

15
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:54,700
Maybe not. But we'll go through everything today, and then, um, we're going to do a short case study together, and then we'll call it a day.

16
00:02:54,700 --> 00:03:02,980
So we'll probably not go the whole 3 hours today, but hopefully you get a good introduction to the course.

17
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:10,480
So, you know, this is really a course on applied health communication.

18
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:14,909
Um, and so why, why is health communication important?

19
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:24,309
And when we think about the broader field, so one of the, um, one of the main issues, um, is that, you know, when I think of,

20
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:30,070
when I say the word consumer, I'm talking about people who are at the receiving end of any health communication.

21
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:38,080
So it could be your everyday citizen, it could be any of us as professionals, it could be organizations.

22
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:42,309
Um, so when I say consumer, it can mean a whole, whole lot of things.

23
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:50,740
But, you know, in our, in our field and in the world globally, there's been a lot of growth and medical advances in technology.

24
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:54,430
Um, there's this increasing role of prevention.

25
00:03:54,940 --> 00:04:02,140
Um, you know, one in two people manage a chronic disease, one in four have multiple chronic conditions in our society.

26
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,370
So self-management has become more and more relevant.

27
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:13,720
Um, meaning that, um, we need to take greater, greater responsibility around the role of self-management.

28
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:21,610
Um, patient education, um, is now, um, more of a mandate in the health care setting.

29
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:28,240
So, um, you know, when you step into health care and, um, you're the patient, you have,

30
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:33,970
you have a lot of rights and you have a lot of rights to be fully, fully informed and engaged in the decision making.

31
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:42,760
This is not necessarily a suggestion anymore. It's become more and more of a mandate with policies when we step into health care.

32
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:52,270
And then there's this issue of compliance, knowledge and understanding when it comes to engaging in our health.

33
00:04:52,270 --> 00:05:03,459
So in so many ways, health communications have become more and more important in in how we manage individual health,

34
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:07,960
community health and the health of our society and globally.

35
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,930
So it also ties to healthy people goals.

36
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:23,010
So these are goals set by the nation around us and really is there's sort of a compass around the health work we do in this country.

37
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:27,440
And there's a whole section on health communication in these goals.

38
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:35,009
So a lot of the things you'll learn in this class are relevant to any work that you

39
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:39,860
end up doing in practice or in research or in your careers that lead to these goals.

40
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:46,200
So we want to deliver accurate, accessible and actionable health information that's targeted and tailored.

41
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:48,450
You'll learn how to do that in this class.

42
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:56,730
We want to enable people to make quick and informed actions to health risks and help with public health emergencies.

43
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:00,629
Nobody reads through pages of information anymore.

44
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:08,340
We need to be able to get information into people's hands and process through

45
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:13,200
their minds in a way that enables people to take action in an informed way.

46
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:17,790
So there are so many modalities to do that now,

47
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:24,450
and we're going to talk about the wide range of modalities to be able to communicate health information in this fast.

48
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:31,110
We also want to increase health literacy skills within our society,

49
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:39,500
and we want to provide new opportunities to connect with culturally diverse and hard to reach populations with our health communications.

50
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:47,340
So we'll be spending a little bit of time in this class talking about, you know, you can have a topic in mind,

51
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:57,510
but how do you actually tailor any sort of messaging to reach just a wide range of audiences and cultures and backgrounds?

52
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:04,620
And then we want to provide sound principles and design of programs and interventions that result in health behaviors.

53
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:11,150
So, um, so there's a science behind us and this is really a designed science class.

54
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:18,270
That's what I, what I think about when I think about sort of the core of this course, it's really about design science.

55
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:25,880
So, so what is this? So there's the study of knowledge versus the study of a solution.

56
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:32,550
And many of you were in my class last semester where we talked a lot about theories and.

57
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:39,219
Basically that's the study of knowledge. We spent our time in the study of knowledge.

58
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:45,480
So why things exist in the world, why things happen the way they do.

59
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:55,360
That's what we talked about all of last semester at age 8600 and, you know, other classes where we're concerned with the study of knowledge.

60
00:07:55,660 --> 00:08:01,450
What are your research methods courses where we're developing tools to test hypothesis and

61
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:06,190
thinking about different sort of observational and qualitative and quantitative methods.

62
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:11,799
That's all the study of knowledge, and we're not going to emphasize any of that in this class.

63
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:18,040
So we are going to talk about qualitative approaches to applied health communication,

64
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:26,049
but it will be very practice based and how you would actually apply it in the development of health communications.

65
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:30,760
But we're not really going to focus on the study of knowledge in this class.

66
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:37,180
We're really focused on the study of a solution. So that's really the core of this class.

67
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:40,900
So that incorporates and emphasizes design science.

68
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:47,590
We want to focus on building materials and artifacts and not proving or testing theories.

69
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:53,620
Methods will be iterative and a lot of it will be qualitative in what we do.

70
00:08:54,100 --> 00:09:02,649
And there's a lot of emphasis on understanding our audience and engaging participation with our audiences and thinking

71
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:09,430
about the relevance of what we're creating to them in the actions we hope for them to take with what we're creating.

72
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:13,780
So this will really be the emphasis of this class.

73
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:24,630
So when we think about major audiences in our field, you know, who are we?

74
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:34,060
Who are we targeting communications to? Yeah.

75
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:40,100
That what I see from the care. Maybe like the families.

76
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:47,499
It sounds like in a health care context or a care delivery context, anyone stepping through those doors,

77
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:54,340
it could actually be any of us or it could be our families or any member of our society who may need that care.

78
00:09:55,210 --> 00:10:00,700
Who else? Yeah.

79
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:04,200
They're thinking about it, especially like early 40 seconds.

80
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:12,310
Got a little bit back on the messaging that we now know what to do and that's pretty much a religious thing in general.

81
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:13,780
Yeah.

82
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:23,890
So when issues are relevant to everyone, everyone, um, our major audience is like in the pandemic context where we're literally every single person,

83
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:32,980
um, you know, yeah, it could also be turning or it's a specific chronic condition and like people who already have a diagnosis,

84
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:39,260
okay, so by certain characteristics, so it could be by product condition, it could be by, um,

85
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:49,870
maybe other clinical characteristics that you might have or your demographic characteristics or other sort of identity related factors.

86
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:59,170
Yeah. People who consume media, like people who are watching commercials, are reading newspapers and magazines and seeing those ads.

87
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:10,290
Okay. So consumers of media and it could be any of us as professionals, it could be, um, members of our community.

88
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:15,580
It could also be a lot of decision makers who consume that information and make

89
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:20,980
decisions that impact a wide range of people and marginalized communities.

90
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:27,030
You need to have this belief that all your.

91
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:36,780
So we have a wide range of beliefs and practices within our own society and across the globe.

92
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:46,650
And unfortunately, there's also a wave, an epidemic of misinformation that has plagued us over the past many years.

93
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:54,030
So, you know, when we think about hard to reach populations, marginalized populations, minority populations,

94
00:11:54,570 --> 00:12:01,200
um, you know, there are, there are a lot of, um, nuance, there are layered issues around that.

95
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:10,380
And so when we think about health communications, we want to be able to, um, um, take that into account and think about that as we're,

96
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:15,330
you know, not just the information we're trying to convey and whatever we're building,

97
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:21,330
but how do we sort of get that across in a way that's appropriate and, um, you know,

98
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:29,010
really conveys people's preferences and how they want to receive information and marry within the next couple of weeks.

99
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:37,050
We'll be talking about that. Um, you know, how do you sort of think about culture in the context of, um, applied health communication?

100
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:44,580
So, um, I think you guys hit on a lot of these major audiences that we sort of,

101
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:48,380
um, you know, with the work that we're going to do in this class and um,

102
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:53,490
generally in Applied Health Communications, these are, um, this is not an exhaustive list,

103
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:58,890
but these are many of the major audiences that we hope to, um, to engage.

104
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,930
So, um. You know, I know some of you.

105
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:09,440
Some of you. This is a new experience having me as your instructor.

106
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,530
So I'll just do a brief introduction of myself.

107
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:21,019
I did my training here at the University of Michigan School of Public Health, and each year there was a time where I was a master student,

108
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:28,170
just like you, sitting here in May 26, 41 and learning from a fabulous instructor.

109
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:36,010
So I did my masters here. Then I went on and did my Ph.D. here as well, and then joined the faculty.

110
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:38,870
So I've been on the faculty for about ten years now.

111
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:47,240
I am originally from California, born and raised, went to college there, never thought I'd leave, but now this is home.

112
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:54,700
I really like being in Ann Arbor at University of Michigan and you know, I've never gotten bored here.

113
00:13:54,710 --> 00:14:02,420
So having done my education and been on the faculty for a long time, it's all continues to be very exciting for me.

114
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:08,990
I teach our theory course, which many of you engaged with me last semester?

115
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:12,260
H.B. 8600. I also teach this course.

116
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:17,209
I'm also associate chair of the beauty department.

117
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:26,270
So one of the joys of that position is being able to think about our teaching program and how to best serve our students, faculty and staff.

118
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:33,280
I have a dog and a little dog. He's a Japanese. Six years old, £10.

119
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:39,669
Um, hangs out with me when I work at home. Um, I'm also married.

120
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:43,690
My husband is an attorney, and he works down the street from our house.

121
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:47,770
Um, in our spare time, um, we're big foodies.

122
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:54,060
Um, like to travel and plan our adventures around the kind of food we're going to eat.

123
00:14:54,070 --> 00:15:00,549
So, um, definitely find ways to engage outside of work.

124
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:07,600
But, um, being here at the University of Michigan and, um, engaging with students is a big, a joy of my life.

125
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:17,710
So I'd love to get to know a little bit more about you and your motivation for taking this course.

126
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:26,810
I know it's part of or some of you are required selective, so maybe that's why you took this course or maybe you're just really interested.

127
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:34,070
But we'd love to sort of hear about maybe situations where health materials may have been particularly difficult

128
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:40,490
for you or someone you know to really digest what context that does and would love to also just know your name.

129
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:43,510
You're in program. So where should we?

130
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,620
You want to start us off? Sure.

131
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:54,530
My name is John and I'm a second year MPH student in healthcare, health, education and situation where something was difficult.

132
00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:02,720
In the last couple of years, my family has been like gave me like five or anything like that running in my family.

133
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:07,070
So like we've been arguing like information about sense of being kind of not difficult,

134
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:11,630
but it's like an understanding, like timeline of like who has, who doesn't.

135
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:18,640
Our family has been difficult to like learning that material without looking at it from the head of being diagnosed as of yet.

136
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:22,540
So it's like how that looks for me and how that looks. My mom had good.

137
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:28,020
That's been health information that's been difficult to.

138
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:33,490
Thank you for sharing that. Hi, my name is Sudan.

139
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:38,040
Second year is big MPH situation.

140
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:44,850
When help matters, I will interact with people whose language is not English.

141
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:49,980
So that's a language barrier. So I'm trying to figure out how to do that more efficiently.

142
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,839
Thank you for sharing. Nice to meet you. Hi, I'm Jackie.

143
00:16:54,840 --> 00:17:00,480
Here I am, Fiji. Second year. Also, my background is very similar to this course,

144
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:08,850
basically design and marketing strategy and how to focus on kind of digital media in the past four years.

145
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:15,780
Yeah, so I'm really excited because then I was using it to like sell people stuff and educate and then this is like for health.

146
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:19,169
And so I'm really curious to see how it's like very different.

147
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:27,629
Audience Someone I used to work with reflect kind of situation and I feel like that's to part with like difficulty with health materials.

148
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,550
Some of that I feel like I just didn't receive.

149
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:36,860
So like when I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's, like I had to like find stuff myself and like read books and like learn more about it.

150
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:42,629
The other thing, doing some communication like social media for health materials,

151
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:48,030
I found it to be very like steep compared to like a marketing that I was used to.

152
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:54,060
And so I felt like it was very like stale and didn't really like connect and like add more relevancy to the audience.

153
00:17:54,720 --> 00:18:08,730
So yeah, thank you for sharing. Nice to meet here and I'm a first year and page and I'm also as well I can recall

154
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:13,340
a time probably like five or six years ago when I was getting a lot work done.

155
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:20,040
It was like a standard one panel and I am not very like biologically minded, so I don't remember why,

156
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:30,300
but something was elevated and when they give you the printout of your results, you know what to do, what the remedy was like, losing weight.

157
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:34,610
And I'm like, Yeah. So I was like, You don't need to lose weight here.

158
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:40,260
And it just made me think about like, if I was someone that did struggle with like the image or things like that,

159
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:43,440
that could be such problematic as the training that I'm receiving.

160
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:50,000
And then also I was like, Well, I don't need to know what do I need to do to get this important or so?

161
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,490
Just makes me think that was not at all tailor made.

162
00:18:52,560 --> 00:19:01,530
It was just the generic stuff that you hear and how it could have been much worse, but it wasn't a good example of communication.

163
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:06,989
Yeah, so a message isn't just always a message. It could be. We really have to be careful with their words.

164
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:12,209
Things can be stigmatizing or, you know, bizarre, especially given the example that you shared.

165
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:21,300
So thank you for sharing that. And then Instagram also affected your student so much for me, not my parents.

166
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:27,600
First language is Spanish. So often my siblings and I had to translate a lot of their medical information and like kind of translate at appointments.

167
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:31,680
So often that was like very difficult when we were given very vague information and

168
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:36,450
like trying to digest that myself and then like that's my parents was very difficult.

169
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:41,639
And I think often just health literacy is very high for people who with English as a second language.

170
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:45,719
So I think that's also difficult in healthcare settings when you're given material that's

171
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:49,350
like even hard in English to digest and then to try to translate that for someone else.

172
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:55,889
Yeah. And sometimes there aren't even the same words in another language.

173
00:19:55,890 --> 00:20:01,530
And even for native English speakers, health literacy is unfortunately quite low.

174
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:08,819
So it's a it's an epidemic that cuts across a lot of populations.

175
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:17,399
But thank you for sharing your example. That's definitely a challenging situation when we don't have materials translated

176
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:22,410
into the variety of languages that might benefit a very diverse population.

177
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:34,850
So it's a pandemic. There's been a lot of misinformation that will get the vaccine.

178
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:40,470
I think that's been seen as a pathway to citizenship for them.

179
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:44,540
So it just shows that this is really yeah,

180
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:54,230
we have a need absolutely have not done a good job based on the data of conveying vaccine and COVID 19 information.

181
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,210
Underlying that is, no, I'm not in any country.

182
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:08,300
Um, for me what comes to mind is I used to keep stuff down after undergrad I couple of years and we you

183
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:14,730
really standardized like evidence based curriculum but I was working with like foreign aid groups,

184
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:25,460
literacy levels and like English ability. So I had to figure out what, how to adapted in a way that was relevant and also was okay.

185
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:32,210
Click here to enlarge the film. Um, and that was really challenging.

186
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:41,750
Thank you for sharing that. I'm hoping one of the things we get out of this class is thinking about sort of the latest ways that,

187
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:47,900
um, people engaged with communications or versus sort of traditional didactic,

188
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:58,880
um, sort of situations that might, um, you know, lend itself better to reaching the diversity of populations and age groups that we might work with.

189
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:04,040
I'm not very I'm a second year or two.

190
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:11,000
And I didn't think about my grandparents and my parents understanding computers and the kids.

191
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:18,590
And luckily they were there to like be able to log into their home portal where like all the information is these days.

192
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:28,850
But I think that if you don't have that system and you don't understand the terms and figuring out how to speak to.

193
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:35,360
No. It seems like they're having everyone log into everything now.

194
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:42,650
Um, and I have to admit, even myself, I don't want to create another log in and going to another portal.

195
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:50,120
So it's, it can definitely be overwhelming, especially for those who have to seek um,

196
00:22:50,210 --> 00:23:00,280
health care regularly it done straight-A student I've had my senior year for the last year on language accessibility and healthcare here.

197
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:06,560
Yeah. I since he was going in for heart surgery about two weeks after our interview,

198
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:11,450
he told me how because primarily what is on the is nursing is the problem.

199
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:16,580
They tried to give him material and one line he was like, it doesn't make sense.

200
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,990
Even then one doesn't like the family publicly.

201
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:25,940
And here you go. And that's one thing that I think about.

202
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:30,980
But yeah, translation is absolutely not that easy.

203
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:35,000
Um, it's definitely much more intensive than that.

204
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:42,469
And it's, it's really sad and unfortunate when people are at the receiving end of that, people have a right to that.

205
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:48,830
It's embedded into laws actually to have the right to have translated information.

206
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:51,860
So we do, we do need to do a better job.

207
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:56,570
You know, are you see, I'm a first year G.M. student,

208
00:23:57,110 --> 00:24:02,810
and the first kind of situation in mine was when I had just like a minor health complication, but I was away from home.

209
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:07,850
And when you don't when receive appropriate materials from a doctor, you're like, go down the rabbit hole of the Internet.

210
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:14,330
Um, and so that was just like when I didn't get health materials, I, like, found myself spiraling down.

211
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:25,010
Yes. And again, like, there's such a huge epidemic of misinformation that that can be misleading and daunting for a lot of people.

212
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:32,809
Great. Sarah, I'd love for your students read to you from the first situation I can really think

213
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:40,910
of was recently my mom was in the hospital and simply like but severely so um.

214
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:47,959
But like when the doctors were coming in and just telling her like test results and like what you need to do now, it's so overwhelming.

215
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:55,520
And she's like, I don't even know where to begin. And then like they give her, he doesn't need as of reading or obviously that was a request.

216
00:24:55,940 --> 00:25:01,280
So I was just like really frustrating for her and for us because we're just like, I need to know what to do.

217
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:06,290
And it's telling us so many different things and using all this medical terminology that we don't really know.

218
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:12,980
So that's just like the first thing I can think of. The good news is, Oh, I'm glad to hear your mom's doing better.

219
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:21,350
And the good news is we're not going to do that in this class because that sort of approach to giving people information is like,

220
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:26,930
outdated, not in vogue. Um, we really need to stop doing it.

221
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:33,140
So my goal is to really empower you with a lot of good tools to do something different.

222
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:42,009
Hi. I'm Emma. I'm a first year big blood work, like receiving blood work also came to mind.

223
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:45,219
I do like a follow up panel a couple of years ago.

224
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:49,100
And when it gets sent to your portal, the Vista,

225
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:54,260
the panel with all the medical jargon and not knowing how to interpret it before your doctor

226
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:59,769
can't like catch it or rent you and get in there beforehand and like spell it out for you.

227
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:10,959
So I opened up like the panel and what I saw was like hepatitis B positive, which they test for an antibodies and I didn't know that.

228
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:17,710
So for like a solid 3 minutes, I was like, somehow I've contracted hepatitis B and I have hepatitis B now.

229
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:24,820
And so there was like a few moments of like absolute panic before I realized they're testing for antibodies.

230
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:26,590
I've been vaccinated as a child.

231
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:36,810
So, I mean, just like when you're given the opportunity to play doctor like that, it, it does like, get you down the same kind of spiral as you are.

232
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:43,540
If you were, like, doing the bad thing. Yeah, it it puts a lot of responsibility on health care professionals and.

233
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:45,969
Well, well, we're all going to be, you know,

234
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:54,190
once your degree is conferred like you have a responsibility around that and what you what you convey to people and how you do it.

235
00:26:55,090 --> 00:27:02,260
So obviously getting those results with before having a conversation with an expert is clearly pretty daunting.

236
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:10,930
Hi. My name is the one that I knew that even my first intervention and the situation

237
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:16,090
with it was actually when I came here to the US we had different countries,

238
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:23,409
but when I was in Lebanon, my mother, so I'm slightly over there.

239
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:27,790
They explained exactly where you are, what you need to do, what's next.

240
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:32,150
And over here, I thought a lot of things were like, What do you want from me?

241
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:35,650
And I was like, You're the doctor. You give me what I want from you.

242
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:40,480
I like, you know, like just and I seen it like four times before the first doctors.

243
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:49,720
And it was very striking things for me that they keep asking this other thing, you tell me, you know, I just felt it.

244
00:27:50,050 --> 00:28:02,380
And I feel like they don't explain things very well. So I'm like, that's why I think it's more important for me to know about her than I'm alone.

245
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:11,380
Yeah. So, um, that made me think about, like, shared decision making, and, you know, that it.

246
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:23,280
It's not necessarily a one size fits all in terms of how we engage our patients and what preferences are all of our patients or,

247
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:28,310
you know, how we communicate in that interaction and how we take it.

248
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:34,290
Culture and beliefs around that interaction into account become even more important.

249
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:49,900
There is a situation over three years and I think that for me and that is I'm not even 60.

250
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:58,350
I don't know when, you know, just like that my parents and then being on the phone and waiting in our office,

251
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:02,370
a government official tell me what to do and then how to apply that.

252
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:09,149
And then later doesn't tell me that the form was built on correctly and how my dad without insurance was working out.

253
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:12,150
And oh my gosh, I don't know how to help you other.

254
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:16,950
But here we are. And that's just. Yeah.

255
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:21,030
And health insurance, once you turn 65, is something.

256
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:24,719
No, you know, many people earn in this country.

257
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:30,480
So it's really disappointing that it becomes so complicated for many older adults to navigate.

258
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:40,860
I imagine the anniversary changes. Do you know what comes to mind is currently in communication and how that really not a lot of information

259
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:46,860
out there on health like environmental health relates to human health can coexist with each other.

260
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:56,650
One of the striking issues of our time and it's know we need the whole world on board with that.

261
00:29:56,660 --> 00:30:01,610
But clearly our messaging hasn't gone very needs to go.

262
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:11,540
I was your age basically in a situation like that.

263
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:20,750
So my parents didn't go to college just the first year was secretly English as it is.

264
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:34,480
So I think it's like they feel that because I have spoken about everything I see like that is this is an accident.

265
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:44,320
They understand that. So it's kind of like, yeah, and people have a wide range of preferences around, you know,

266
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:54,710
wanting and wanting assistance and help and navigating health related contacts and health information as well.

267
00:30:57,370 --> 00:31:06,130
Pretty sure I was not by as we talked about it.

268
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,970
Although I get the small bits and pieces of it.

269
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:17,100
But when my brother was diagnosed with autism, especially when there was nothing that was talked about or accepted,

270
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:24,090
and my father in of his medical school was serious about autism.

271
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:29,800
He didn't really have a textbook definition of what obviously was happening in there.

272
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:34,170
So that was something that was really hard for me. Yeah.

273
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:47,800
So we can have definitions around health and recommendations that again may not translate to the different audiences we might be trying to cater to.

274
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:55,799
So again, one of the big emphases of this course is to really think about our audience when we're designing the materials,

275
00:31:55,800 --> 00:32:02,680
we're designing your students.

276
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:13,010
And I'm also heard of a situation where a family as well.

277
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:23,460
So I understand that. And I wouldn't I thought that Inception found it very difficult to process it early.

278
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:37,110
Understand that is exactly like the doctors who you're on like they were as clear what that diagnosis was and what that is.

279
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:45,690
So I do remember her calling here and, you know, trying to figure out what that is.

280
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:52,200
My mom and her daughter. So it's definitely different.

281
00:32:57,210 --> 00:32:59,790
Yeah, absolutely.

282
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:11,140
So cancer is when we're dealing with cancer or other sort of very acutely or potentially for lack of a better word, lethal type of conditions.

283
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:20,250
And it can be scary. So, you know, how do you convey scary information in a way that people can actually digest to take action?

284
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:24,450
Um, I mean, it takes people's feelings into account.

285
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:30,279
I was. I'm sorry.

286
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:39,650
Use all the information I came out with, especially this.

287
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:43,950
There are so many different ways, you know,

288
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:52,410
and it's like a lot of information just from the companies that were designing the different sorts of systems and challenging things.

289
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:56,999
But at first you don't mind it.

290
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:04,650
It's like, okay, this is actually what is at the scientific level or is this just the company saying our system is the best?

291
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:11,159
Yeah, you bring up a really important point around trust and credibility of information.

292
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:23,250
So one of the things that, um, is every year students go through this process of finding the best sources to convey

293
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:28,770
in their health materials and making sure that's very clear to participants as well.

294
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:34,229
Like if you are creating some sort of message or providing some sort of fact, where did it come from?

295
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:43,709
People have a right to know that. So thank you so much for sharing about your experiences with health materials.

296
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:54,360
It sounds like many of you have important experience that you'll bring into the projects into this class,

297
00:34:54,840 --> 00:35:02,459
and a lot of motivation I can sense to perhaps do something different here and an eagerness

298
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:08,800
to sort of think about the different tools and techniques to be able to do that and.

299
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:15,360
So I want to talk about the syllabus and the different projects, and I posted it on canvas.

300
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:24,340
I didn't bring copies just to save some paper, so I'll go ahead and just projected it as well.

301
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:28,660
And if you want to follow along by pulling it up on canvas, that would be great.

302
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:36,639
I've taught this class for about ten years and it's one of my favorite classes to teach,

303
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:44,890
and I'm always blown away by the talent and creativity the students engage with with their projects.

304
00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:52,060
So this is a really exciting class for me to teach, and it's always a lot of fun for all of us.

305
00:35:52,840 --> 00:36:01,880
So I'm. You know, starting on the first page, um, you know, I'll respond to emails within about 24 hours.

306
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:06,980
Um, if you can put the course name in the subject line.

307
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:13,010
And I'm a, I'd love to have a conversation with you. So if you have a quick questions, just email them.

308
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:16,130
That's very easy for me to get back to you very quickly.

309
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:24,260
But if it's something lengthy or requires probably a lot of back and forth for me to sort of understand and assist you,

310
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:31,760
I'd love to just chat with you either just hop on the phone or on Zoom, or if it's before or after class.

311
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:36,560
Um, I think that's probably most efficient, so definitely take advantage of that.

312
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:44,600
I don't do formal office hours because any time I've done that, um, you guys have like such busy schedules.

313
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:52,060
You're in so many classes and have so many things going on that, um, there's really no time that works for everyone.

314
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:58,190
But, um, by appointment, you know, that gives you an opportunity to work it around your schedule.

315
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:04,280
And I'm always available to you. So definitely take advantage of reaching out and, um, setting up a time.

316
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:11,059
And I'm happy to engage with you that way. We also have a lot of group time in class to work on projects,

317
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:17,090
so that's also another time for me to, um, you know, go round to group to answer questions.

318
00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:28,280
So, you know, you have class time and time outside of has to be able to get feedback and engage in terms of course readings.

319
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:36,440
Um, I, yeah, one of the required texts is letting go of the words, um, the second edition of the book.

320
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:40,639
I highly recommend if you have an opportunity to purchase it.

321
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:45,200
This is something that, well, you'll keep on yourself and you'll use be on this course.

322
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:48,979
It has a lot of great tips, um, you know,

323
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:58,580
around best practices for a lot of different sort of health materials and messaging and different ways of communicating information.

324
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:07,190
And a lot of it's a good sort of practical tool. And there will be some of the readings from this book assigned for some of the class sections.

325
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:11,270
So, um, we meet once a week during this time.

326
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:19,940
Um, the course will be taught in person. Um, if they're I always keep track of the weather and I would never want to put any of you guys in danger.

327
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:25,730
So if there's any sort of situation where it's not safe to drive in.

328
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:33,679
Um, for a lot of people, I'll definitely move the class to another modality and I'll keep an eye on that.

329
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:41,120
So it's not, it's been quite warm, so I'm not even sure we'll need to go there.

330
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:44,719
But, um, again, I'll keep an eye on that through the semester.

331
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:52,490
Um, but you know, here for me, assuming that we're meeting in person and we'll have class here on Friday mornings.

332
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:56,569
Um, the sessions will be a lot.

333
00:38:56,570 --> 00:39:05,210
I won't be talking to you over. Like, I'll give you some information and give you a lot of tools.

334
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:14,360
Um, and, but mostly I'll be facilitating quite a few activities in class, and that's where I see a lot of the learning happening.

335
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:20,880
And we'll be having quite a few, um, expert guest speakers talk to you and give you, um,

336
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:27,889
a lot of good tools around design science that will be coming in and leading some of the sessions.

337
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:32,880
So that's sort of where you can expect, um, you know, coming in here, um,

338
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:41,270
ready to engage with your peers and with guest speakers around, um, a lot of this stuff we're going to learn.

339
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:46,969
So, um, attendance will be part of your grade.

340
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:50,630
And I take attendance seriously because, um.

341
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:54,589
This is a small class.

342
00:39:54,590 --> 00:40:05,450
And when a lot of us don't show up, you're you're both cheating yourself and you're cheating your peers out of a graduate experience in this class.

343
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:09,370
So unfortunately, it's not all about you.

344
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:13,040
It's about all of us together creating this learning experience.

345
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:18,620
And I know stuff is might come up. If you're sick, you should not come to class.

346
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:24,889
And I understand that. And I want you to stay home and get better and we'll work together around that.

347
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:28,610
And that's not going to affect your participation grade.

348
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:36,049
You know, I really encourage you to communicate with me, but the expectation is to come to class.

349
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:40,100
We meet once a week, so missing a lot of class.

350
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:47,840
And especially given the group project nature of this class, it really doesn't make sense to miss a lot of class.

351
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:59,750
So I want to be just very clear and frank that a lot of you will be put into groups around group projects like Monday.

352
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:03,800
So I'm going to get to that, like how, how we're going to get there.

353
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:08,120
I know sometimes students shop around for classes and that's fine.

354
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:16,580
This isn't a great class to do that. So, you know, if you're sitting here sort of on the fence, whether you want to take this class,

355
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:25,879
not loving group projects or working with other people or just want to, it thought it might be an opportunity to sort of passively participate.

356
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:29,810
You might want to think about another option for your squadron.

357
00:41:29,810 --> 00:41:38,270
This might not be a great course. The class is not going to change to accommodate that and no hard feelings if you decide to drop.

358
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:44,150
We would just I would encourage you to do that today because I will be putting students into groups.

359
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:53,389
But again, I've been teaching this class for about ten years and students have consistently loved the group

360
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:59,960
experience and the opportunity to work with their peers around a pretty intensive project.

361
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:10,549
So I think it's a really rewarding class and I'm excited to engage with all of you, so I don't want you to drop, but it is your choice.

362
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:15,500
If the course expectations and what to expect don't really meet your needs.

363
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:23,850
So, um, it won't be possible to get higher than a C in the class if you miss more than 20% of the classes.

364
00:42:24,310 --> 00:42:30,270
And again, we only meet once a week. Um, so again, I really encourage you to show up.

365
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:38,270
Um, a lot of the assignments are group related, but they're related to building your project.

366
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:46,260
So these are like, so you're not like creating a project and then doing all these random assignments that are not related.

367
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:54,390
A lot of them will be geared towards the culmination of your project that will be with a community based organization.

368
00:42:54,960 --> 00:43:02,100
So we'll start off by putting you guys into groups and what I want you guys to spend some time

369
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:08,700
thinking about your process together and working together and creating a plan around that.

370
00:43:09,210 --> 00:43:12,110
In about two weeks you'll meet with your preceptors.

371
00:43:12,110 --> 00:43:17,580
So we have a series of organizations that have offered projects for the class that you'll be working on.

372
00:43:18,150 --> 00:43:29,110
And, um, during, you'll be coming up with a list of questions for your preceptor as one of your assignments to really understand the project,

373
00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:34,020
um, in depth, because you'll need to create a project plan which is one of your upcoming assignments.

374
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:39,360
And you're at this point in time, you only have sort of a brief description of what it is.

375
00:43:40,030 --> 00:43:47,400
Um, so meeting with them and creating expectations, coming up with a communication plan with them throughout the semester to get feedback,

376
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:51,840
um, will be really important towards the meeting that you'll have with them.

377
00:43:52,590 --> 00:43:57,479
Um, part of your assignment will be creating audience personas and goals.

378
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:05,790
And next week we'll talk more about like what that is and how does that sort of relate to design science and actually creating materials.

379
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:11,940
And then your one of your only individual assignments,

380
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:20,280
your two of them will be a reflection on cultural humility related to health materials and a health literacy assignment,

381
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:26,580
which is like my all time favorite assignment and it's very hands on and helps you create, I hope, material.

382
00:44:27,210 --> 00:44:32,730
Um, so you'll be doing that and then we'll do a mock focus group in class, um,

383
00:44:32,850 --> 00:44:42,540
to get feedback on the stuff that you're creating and where you'll learn how to create a focus group guide around, um, testing materials around that.

384
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:50,790
And then at the end we'll do presentations, team evaluations, and then we'll turn in your final products.

385
00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:52,739
So that's what you can expect.

386
00:44:52,740 --> 00:45:00,300
And so most of these assignments are really related to your project and you're really encouraged to work on them with each other.

387
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:17,330
Any questions so far? So if you require any sort of accommodations to succeed in this course, definitely let me know right away.

388
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:26,760
I want to make sure we can modify the course in any way so that you are set up for success somewhere.

389
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:37,290
A lot of this stuff is standard and you know about academic integrity, code of conduct, diversity, equity and inclusion.

390
00:45:37,310 --> 00:45:44,000
All of those things apply to every class and they apply to this class as well in terms of treating each other with respect and

391
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:54,209
treating our guest speakers with respect and ensuring that guest speakers also come in with respect and into this classroom as well.

392
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:57,260
And that's my job to really make sure that that's happening.

393
00:45:59,630 --> 00:46:07,250
So in terms of the class schedule, next week we'll be talking about situation analysis,

394
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:11,480
connecting theory to goals and what it means to create a persona.

395
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:15,530
And then that following week you'll be meeting with your preceptors.

396
00:46:15,530 --> 00:46:21,769
So you'll have a week to do that and we won't have class on the 20th.

397
00:46:21,770 --> 00:46:25,580
And that might be a time you schedule with your preceptors to have a meeting,

398
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:32,840
but you'll have a week to make sure you have a meeting with them and really understand the scope of your project.

399
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:41,750
And then, um, we'll have, um, a series of guest speakers where you'll learn you'll get a crash course in graphic design.

400
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:49,990
We have some folks from the School of Information who have taught graphic design for a really long time and do a great job.

401
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:56,120
I'm really giving you the nuts and bolts of this really critical skill.

402
00:46:56,570 --> 00:47:05,630
You'll learn how to use Photoshop and different sort of the Adobe three and designed different sort of tools to create materials.

403
00:47:07,430 --> 00:47:16,130
You'll also learn about film and media, what it means to sort of create a movie or a short video.

404
00:47:16,430 --> 00:47:18,140
What does it take to do that?

405
00:47:18,350 --> 00:47:25,790
How do you create a story building effective presentations for health, education, and also learn a little bit about podcasting.

406
00:47:26,810 --> 00:47:33,230
So we'll bring in some folks who have expertise around that and wind up going to for some of these

407
00:47:33,230 --> 00:47:39,260
sessions will end up going to some of their labs at the libraries because they'll be it'll be hands on.

408
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:46,190
So they'll be walking you through how to create something as they're teaching you some of the skills.

409
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:52,729
So that's what you can expect week by week. And again today.

410
00:47:52,730 --> 00:48:01,010
You have to sit and listen to me a little more, but you can expect week by week you'll be engaging with each other and you'll be pretty active.

411
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:08,780
Any questions about the syllabus or course expectations for the sessions that have readings that come inside with it?

412
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:18,420
When you're looking at the syllabus, the readings are expected to read for the following class, if that makes sense.

413
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:28,410
Yeah. So when you read the ones on your two or three days, you would read them under two in preparation for the class.

414
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:33,440
Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah. Yes.

415
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:38,570
Regarding the preceptors, are they generic community organizations?

416
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:41,730
Is it the same for all the D groups or will be different for each group?

417
00:48:42,450 --> 00:48:45,600
Good question. And a nice segway to the projects.

418
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:54,389
So I'm the canvas say it's a pretty simple can recite the home page should have everything wi

419
00:48:54,390 --> 00:49:00,570
fi weak the assignments are under assignments and then under course essentials go to projects.

420
00:49:02,050 --> 00:49:14,170
Um, and project description. So we have four organizations and five projects for the course, and each of each organization has a preceptor.

421
00:49:14,650 --> 00:49:18,160
So we have the male contraceptive initiative,

422
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:30,850
which is an organization that is really trying to empower men around family planning and thinking about the role of,

423
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:36,610
you know, all members of a couple when it comes to family planning.

424
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:42,070
And they've offered students to choose from one of two options.

425
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:45,460
So if you decide that that's an organization you want to work with,

426
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:51,280
once you get into your groups, you'll you'll be able to decide together of those two options.

427
00:49:51,610 --> 00:49:58,470
Which project do you guys want to pursue? And Catherine Carpenter will be your preceptor.

428
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:09,040
So each organization has a different person assigned who will sort of be your go to around this project ever say is a nonprofit

429
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:19,660
organization and they're really focused on preventing blindness and restoring vision through donation and transplantation and research.

430
00:50:19,990 --> 00:50:27,040
There are a global organization and they also operate in several states,

431
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:33,580
including having offices right here in Michigan and working very closely with the Kellogg Ice Center as well.

432
00:50:34,570 --> 00:50:39,160
And one of their projects is doing two things.

433
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:49,450
So putting together best practices for reaching more diverse audiences around transplantation for corneas,

434
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:54,460
and then designing a set of health communication materials that I'm inspired by

435
00:50:54,880 --> 00:51:00,040
other sort of campaigns with organ donation that have been quite successful.

436
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:03,340
How do we translate that to cornea transplantation?

437
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:13,119
And then the Community Action Network will have two projects, so two separate groups and they're nonprofit.

438
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:22,030
Then, you know, locally in Washtenaw County that primarily serve children, youth and families in under-resourced neighborhoods.

439
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:31,600
And there are two projects, one on providing more up to date information around the COVID 19 pandemic.

440
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:37,839
And one of their motivations for this was there's been a lot of information, but the pandemic has really changed.

441
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:41,300
And we really need to update how we're, you know,

442
00:51:41,410 --> 00:51:50,230
informing the community around transmission vaccine doses and what people can do to really protect themselves.

443
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:57,010
And they have a lot of flexibility around the modality of materials that allows you to get very creative with,

444
00:51:57,340 --> 00:52:02,380
you know, are we creating a pamphlet or are we going to do a short video or something else?

445
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:07,360
What do we think will be most helpful for community members?

446
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:16,330
And then another project will be developing information materials around a set of health behavior prevention topics.

447
00:52:16,990 --> 00:52:21,490
And again, there's flexibility around the modality of materials.

448
00:52:21,490 --> 00:52:25,750
They've offered a few topics that they're particularly interested in.

449
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:32,320
So as a group, you can think about, okay, how are we going to tackle each of these and what modality are we going to use?

450
00:52:32,950 --> 00:52:46,540
And then the final organization is unified. They really focus on HIV, STI prevention and resource connection within Southeast Michigan.

451
00:52:47,110 --> 00:52:53,960
And this organization is also offering students to choose from one of two options for the project.

452
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:58,060
So as a group, you'll get to decide which of these you'll want to focus on.

453
00:52:58,740 --> 00:53:09,100
Um, one of them is on, um, materials related to HIV testing and self-testing initiatives.

454
00:53:09,430 --> 00:53:21,970
And another one is on support groups and providing more information and advertising around the various support groups that they offer.

455
00:53:22,450 --> 00:53:29,799
And they do a lot of social media work and, you know, getting their information out through a lot of different platforms.

456
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:36,130
So you'll have the opportunity to create materials for all of these sort of various platforms that they use.

457
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:42,100
So any questions about their projects or what to expect,

458
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:51,100
I just need to know if we have a particular interest or like you think those are wonderful, similar.

459
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:54,850
So that's where I was going that so you get a.

460
00:53:56,370 --> 00:54:00,000
So there's a ranking form that you'll be able to open.

461
00:54:00,330 --> 00:54:04,590
So it's right there. I want you to fill it out no later than Sunday.

462
00:54:04,890 --> 00:54:09,840
Take some time today if you just want to get it out of the way. That helps me too.

463
00:54:09,850 --> 00:54:14,300
So I can put you guys into groups pretty quickly. But I want you to read the descriptions.

464
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:21,570
Right. And I'm really I always try to give people they're they're sort of top choices

465
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:26,159
around what are what sort of organization or topic they're most interested in.

466
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:29,850
And I'll put folks into groups outside. Yeah.

467
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:37,130
So you write for the Community Action Network, there'll be two separate groups working with the city preceptors.

468
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:41,969
Yeah. So you'll choose in your rankings. Do you want to work on Project one or Project two?

469
00:54:41,970 --> 00:54:49,560
And it'll be separate. So it's they'd never really just like,

470
00:54:49,830 --> 00:54:56,370
let's all meet together and talk about a lot of random things so you'll have the same preceptor and meet different.

471
00:54:58,710 --> 00:55:03,300
You. Any other questions?

472
00:55:09,030 --> 00:55:16,379
So this is one of the first things I want you to do very quickly is give me your preferences and I'll put you guys in two

473
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:25,920
groups and then I'll post that and also do an email introduction to your preceptors so you can start to schedule a meeting,

474
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:37,440
um, for that week where I ask that you guys meet with your preceptors, um, I encourage you to meet for that with them for at least an hour.

475
00:55:37,710 --> 00:55:40,830
Maybe I would maybe schedule an hour and a half if needed.

476
00:55:41,310 --> 00:55:47,940
You really want to try to use that meeting to gather as much information as possible?

477
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:56,880
Um, and we'll walk through that a little more, um, next week in terms of preparing the types of questions you might want to know.

478
00:55:57,210 --> 00:56:01,680
And some of the exercises we'll be doing in class will sort of bring to light the types

479
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:06,630
of things you'll want to ask them to be able to move through your project plan and,

480
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:15,870
um, move through creating your projects. So on the syllabus, um, you probably saw that there's some group time, um,

481
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:22,680
you will need to coordinate with each other outside of class, um, to make progress on your projects.

482
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:29,850
But I also want to make sure you have time in class to, you know, connect with your team members,

483
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:34,890
use that time to work on assignments together and work on your project.

484
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:38,910
So during several class sessions you'll see group time.

485
00:56:39,330 --> 00:56:46,229
So, um, usually I try to carve out about an hour, at least for group time.

486
00:56:46,230 --> 00:56:53,010
There are going to be some entire sessions where you just work on group work, especially towards the end you're going to want that time.

487
00:56:53,520 --> 00:57:01,290
So, um, there's some concessions totally dedicated to you connecting with your team members and working on your projects.

488
00:57:08,990 --> 00:57:20,940
Any other questions? Okay.

489
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:29,370
So you guys want to take a ten minute break and then we'll transition into doing a short case study.

490
00:57:30,330 --> 00:57:47,350
Okay. So let's come back at 910. It's going to take the rest of the year.

491
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:56,830
And I was like, Please, no, like 21.

492
00:57:58,930 --> 00:58:04,000
You just never know. What's the likelihood that I will get it?

493
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:17,050
Why? You. Okay, um. So can you email me after class and, um, say, can I get it to make sure Jackie works in India?

494
00:58:17,110 --> 00:58:29,980
So let's add. You want to take her on, okay?

495
00:58:30,250 --> 00:58:37,810
Yeah. Yeah. You.

496
00:58:57,470 --> 00:59:01,500
Things you have.

497
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:38,800
Virtually all the military excavators, I guess, approaching the town that was.

498
00:59:42,830 --> 00:59:49,720
And where are you right now?

499
00:59:51,070 --> 01:00:03,250
But they might end up like one of those things on it suddenly.

500
01:00:04,970 --> 01:00:08,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

501
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:12,760
But I don't know. It's kind of a moving around.

502
01:00:13,390 --> 01:00:18,090
I never heard of anything like this. Yeah, right, right.

503
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:37,810
Yeah. But I don't think we are in for a real leadership in 1111.

504
01:00:38,950 --> 01:00:52,570
I think that's like when you don't know right now, you know, getting bigger and bigger.

505
01:00:55,630 --> 01:01:26,530
Yeah. Yeah. So I think it's because I only got mixed up in the morning and was like, Yeah, so I'm glad you could make a difference.

506
01:01:27,190 --> 01:01:35,750
We just saw that there was a lot of them. Yeah, yeah.

507
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:41,799
I agree with you on.

508
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:43,330
I think you're right.

509
01:01:43,840 --> 01:02:00,610
It would it take the right people are bringing generics but the heard three are supposed to get the right person just over 3 hours.

510
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:12,280
And I was like, so I, I think in the winter and I was like, what are you going to do about it?

511
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:23,800
So how do you explain to me why am I doing?

512
01:02:23,830 --> 01:02:30,880
Yeah, yeah. I'm sorry you had to help them, but still.

513
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:37,900
But why are you here?

514
01:02:42,970 --> 01:02:51,610
And I wonder if these like I said, I didn't.

515
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:56,139
I didn't really like what little that was in.

516
01:02:56,140 --> 01:03:21,790
I was like, oh, this is not going to be anything.

517
01:03:22,390 --> 01:03:32,049
But certainly most about like living a pretty routine internally for our neighbor.

518
01:03:32,050 --> 01:03:36,220
And I made it regularly like you. Right?

519
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:51,180
I don't think one was intended for her down. So that's like the only reason I am is one of those and traveling every once in a while.

520
01:03:52,030 --> 01:04:00,760
But I'll tell you what I'm like. Yeah, I like you.

521
01:04:01,210 --> 01:04:13,290
Have you ever. I thought all these men like one that they didn't like you that your resentment.

522
01:04:18,110 --> 01:04:31,360
Well, you know, I don't like to want to get.

523
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:44,740
Yeah. Yeah, I you know, because I just.

524
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:45,630
It's a German, you know.

525
01:04:48,530 --> 01:05:19,790
So we have to make sure that whatever happens that our our students will get on board, like, for, like, $60 and stay there for an hour.

526
01:05:21,380 --> 01:05:35,420
I just don't think that, you know, it's like it's like a house, just like most of us that.

527
01:05:37,810 --> 01:05:38,830
We're back. Okay.

528
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:50,110
Um, so I think I forgot to mention a lot of the organizations end up using what you actually created and disseminating it in practice.

529
01:05:50,110 --> 01:05:58,600
And I've seen this time and time again over the past ten years, I've been teaching this class and that's really exciting.

530
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:08,590
Um, they love working with our students and are really I'm always impressed and they're always very impressed with what you guys come up with.

531
01:06:09,580 --> 01:06:14,020
You will have, um, resources to assist with your projects.

532
01:06:14,020 --> 01:06:22,180
And I strongly encourage you, you know, when you get into groups to really understand each other's strengths and to capitalize on that,

533
01:06:22,750 --> 01:06:29,290
um, you know, some of the resources I put here are, you know, a guide for writing for social media,

534
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:37,300
um, where you can get stock photos that you might use for your materials and then a whole host of resources

535
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:43,090
around writing and plain language and best practices for sort of conveying words and numbers,

536
01:06:43,570 --> 01:06:54,460
um, that you can reference. And then some of the guest speakers work um, uh, as a resource called Scholar Space at the graduate library.

537
01:06:54,820 --> 01:07:01,059
And they do a lot of consultation around, um, presentations, materials, graphic design.

538
01:07:01,060 --> 01:07:07,360
So I'm going to encourage folks to utilize those resources to get sort of expert

539
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:15,280
advice and opinion or any help as you're working on what you're creating sometimes.

540
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:23,980
Um, we've had students create short videos and they wanted a voiceover and someone sounding super professional and smooth.

541
01:07:24,370 --> 01:07:30,429
Well, we have a school of theater and dance, and we have students who are, um, or voice actors.

542
01:07:30,430 --> 01:07:35,860
And you can, um, you know, this is a nice thing for their portfolio.

543
01:07:35,860 --> 01:07:44,920
So, um, there are a lot of resources on campus, um, for you to really leverage with your products, to make them professional and polished.

544
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:50,170
And, you know, what you end up creating is also a really nice thing to showcase,

545
01:07:50,170 --> 01:07:56,050
like in a professional portfolio as you, you know, embark on internships or the job.

546
01:07:56,560 --> 01:08:02,530
So, um, that's something I can guarantee you with coming out of this class is something

547
01:08:02,530 --> 01:08:08,320
really practical and something you could really use for yourself moving forward.

548
01:08:10,770 --> 01:08:20,489
So day. I work on a case study and I've drafted a scenario and a set of questions.

549
01:08:20,490 --> 01:08:22,680
And so I'd love for you to read through this.

550
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:32,250
And then just around you and groups like 3 to 4, you know, talk through that questions and then we'll come together around what you came up with.

551
01:08:42,160 --> 01:09:01,890
Right. Okay, then.

552
01:09:02,890 --> 01:09:15,380
Yes. In that situation.

553
01:09:18,820 --> 01:09:27,340
What would you do?

554
01:09:28,870 --> 01:09:32,570
Yeah, I think I've got it here.

555
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:44,980
Thanks. It's published.

556
01:09:46,650 --> 01:11:27,490
First. Go ahead and talk to your peers what you had a chance to read through it.

557
01:11:43,210 --> 01:11:47,120
I guess. Just like in the U.S.A.

558
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:56,250
Yeah. Oh, my God. Oh, my goodness.

559
01:11:56,640 --> 01:12:00,630
Thank you. Richard Burton.

560
01:12:01,710 --> 01:12:06,870
Yeah. Every day. Yeah, I.

561
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:13,380
It's like a military. Like one thing or another when they're doing anything, I guess.

562
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:30,330
Yeah. For four weeks and everybody having to chill out.

563
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:51,090
Maybe you should be on the military. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

564
01:12:51,720 --> 01:13:15,490
Then, I mean, obviously, there are things that I think.

565
01:13:15,910 --> 01:13:29,550
I mean, just, like, that's a good thing, I would have to say.

566
01:13:30,690 --> 01:13:46,679
I do like, know what exactly is it that they want to let people know, like that kind of stuff.

567
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:57,950
But I would agree to make sure that they have always been like, I guess like even those other guys.

568
01:13:58,570 --> 01:14:11,160
And I felt like people didn't really understand what was wrong.

569
01:14:11,790 --> 01:14:31,710
Yeah, I'm sure they're like, well, you know, it's like, you have to really have that right now is understandable.

570
01:14:32,580 --> 01:14:49,650
If they would just go after an organization like aftermarket outlet for earnings like food.

571
01:14:51,480 --> 01:15:10,020
And I was like, that's really something I should see are just like, you know,

572
01:15:10,290 --> 01:15:27,620
right, how can I not only as good as screen but for the networks I was citizens.

573
01:15:27,830 --> 01:15:34,500
Yeah, I think it's really strict from now on.

574
01:15:36,330 --> 01:15:52,130
Well, let me just say with the other one and then when you're ready to go.

575
01:15:53,690 --> 01:15:58,319
Yeah I think it will even.

576
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:15,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Those you know so that I guess I was like yeah like, I mean I went outside.

577
01:16:16,380 --> 01:16:34,800
Well I just feel like I'm surrounded by friends like you are basically like you don't know, like, even though it is frustrating to, like, get some.

578
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:53,300
The way he would have been lying to you because you think that was a better idea for the construction of the boat.

579
01:16:56,540 --> 01:17:03,340
I mean, that, you know. So what do you say that?

580
01:17:03,510 --> 01:17:09,860
You know, it's like I live in the suburbs.

581
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:19,690
If they're like this, you know, they're going to do everything.

582
01:17:21,430 --> 01:17:42,610
But, you know, this isn't the first time in my life where, like, I'm, like, looking like, you know, you're not going to do it.

583
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:48,170
I know that, you know?

584
01:17:53,580 --> 01:18:05,610
Yeah, I was reading. That's why I love you so.

585
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:18,300
That's right.

586
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:24,460
That's why I think that I can use it.

587
01:18:25,410 --> 01:18:33,870
And what are we doing?

588
01:18:35,460 --> 01:18:42,180
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So we try to make it your own when you get in there.

589
01:18:42,180 --> 01:18:46,350
And I like you start jumping in and you're just like, I just yeah,

590
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:59,670
I would really like to do this because I feel like I just like everything about my life would be like, Hey, where do we start?

591
01:18:59,790 --> 01:19:07,919
I don't think so. Yeah, I think so.

592
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:12,220
You think it is very much like the other?

593
01:19:12,240 --> 01:19:18,690
Like, you know, like, you know, we don't know.

594
01:19:18,990 --> 01:19:25,330
Yeah. How much is enough? I want to go there.

595
01:19:29,010 --> 01:19:37,310
I want to work at like. I guess. I guess. I guess like you can continue working on it, I.

596
01:19:42,660 --> 01:19:55,440
Yeah. You know, like, I don't know range of that's been personally that I think so should we come together and talk about this.

597
01:19:55,470 --> 01:20:02,820
Yeah. So my what now is like a decade teaching this cause they've seen different flavors of this.

598
01:20:03,630 --> 01:20:07,650
So over the years, not all the time, but I've sort of seen this.

599
01:20:07,660 --> 01:20:16,530
So, um, what are the key issues that jumped out of you in this scenario, thinking about all the different perspectives of the people involved?

600
01:20:17,670 --> 01:20:22,830
Yeah. There should be clear communications that expectations between preceptors and students.

601
01:20:23,220 --> 01:20:30,840
You know, soon as you have asked the the preceptor, what modes of communication is people energetic?

602
01:20:30,900 --> 01:20:39,180
What if they don't reach their needs? And also to reach out to you up to maybe one week or two weeks of non-response.

603
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:47,790
So perhaps maybe being more proactive about a communication plan, it seems like maybe that broke down at some point.

604
01:20:48,610 --> 01:20:53,770
Yeah. Really supportive resistance for this year.

605
01:20:55,950 --> 01:21:01,590
Say that again. A bigger concern is that experience.

606
01:21:01,880 --> 01:21:13,170
Yeah. So is that a problem or is that a live action plan to address it in the future?

607
01:21:14,730 --> 01:21:29,340
Yeah. So there was maybe a little bit of discomfort or anxiety or um, just unknown that just was never addressed and lingered for a while.

608
01:21:30,570 --> 01:21:36,959
Yeah. I guess one issue that we talked about was that the numbers in it really seem to have an

609
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:44,310
awareness of what we'd like the organization had or how often they would like to be contacted.

610
01:21:44,700 --> 01:21:46,859
As we were saying, like for some organization,

611
01:21:46,860 --> 01:21:53,309
this project might just be like a way to build like relationship in the community and for other organizations.

612
01:21:53,310 --> 01:21:57,090
This might be really vital to them to have some of these materials.

613
01:21:57,090 --> 01:22:00,659
So the meeting might be different up like, yeah, yeah,

614
01:22:00,660 --> 01:22:04,830
just do your thing and we'll check it out later versus like we want to be involved

615
01:22:04,830 --> 01:22:08,820
every step of the way and you wouldn't know unless you asked that from the beginning.

616
01:22:09,420 --> 01:22:21,659
Yeah. So there's a wide range of expected communication expectations and that should have sort of been expected and at least solicited.

617
01:22:21,660 --> 01:22:25,229
Like what is it in this situation that's going on?

618
01:22:25,230 --> 01:22:39,120
So we had discussed like just community or anything like that, like a communication event or an IP address,

619
01:22:39,130 --> 01:22:48,780
dollars issue was the inspiration so that that first meeting that you guys are actually going to have in a few weeks,

620
01:22:48,900 --> 01:22:56,370
um, you're saying like that was perhaps a golden opportunity to maybe address some of these things as a group together,

621
01:22:56,700 --> 01:23:00,239
especially given the importance of a first meeting.

622
01:23:00,240 --> 01:23:05,240
And it, you know, first meetings always create impressions and laying the groundwork and,

623
01:23:05,250 --> 01:23:10,110
you know, really taking that seriously as a leader kind of mentioned this.

624
01:23:10,110 --> 01:23:16,560
But I think they could have done a better job of involving you as a liaison between the student and the preceptor,

625
01:23:18,090 --> 01:23:21,479
whatever it is that could help them.

626
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:26,500
But I also you saw that when you get a lower ed organization at the end,

627
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:30,430
like I don't know next year about this thing, we could have been focused on this.

628
01:23:30,900 --> 01:23:35,850
Everyone had a better experience. Yeah. So involving me early on?

629
01:23:37,050 --> 01:23:43,709
I think so for me, I often even if they're not telling me I can pick up something might be going on.

630
01:23:43,710 --> 01:23:51,330
So I could always help, um, you know, figure something out for you, whether, like you said,

631
01:23:51,330 --> 01:23:57,570
me reaching out to the preceptor or maybe providing advice to the group on how to

632
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:01,590
navigate this in a way that really addresses the concerns that they're having.

633
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:09,839
Yeah, I was going in the beginning things like building out a timeline with tasks and deliverables and make sure that's communicated with all parties.

634
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:14,850
And with that, like I was kind of building off like the communication tools.

635
01:24:14,850 --> 01:24:19,760
Like if we're going to, you know, like something for you, there was like a three day review period,

636
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:23,430
like establishing that timeline and expectations early on.

637
01:24:24,090 --> 01:24:27,430
Yeah, because three days might be sufficient for some people.

638
01:24:27,450 --> 01:24:32,510
Some people maybe need more time and just knowing that early on is important.

639
01:24:34,260 --> 01:24:39,719
So did you see like so this group really felt like they had this huge roadblock in front of them.

640
01:24:39,720 --> 01:24:46,140
Did you you know, when you read this scenario in the work they had ahead of them, did you see the same thing?

641
01:24:47,610 --> 01:24:54,269
And I kind of feel the same thing. But I also think like some of the worry that like on my head definitely probably

642
01:24:54,270 --> 01:24:57,780
played a role in like the product that they put out like that worry of like,

643
01:24:57,780 --> 01:25:06,090
oh, not having or having lack of experience that probably maybe the way they shape the material publishing around like,

644
01:25:06,360 --> 01:25:12,659
oh, we know that we don't have this way. So this is how you address like this is how you address that may not have that experience.

645
01:25:12,660 --> 01:25:23,340
So I think if it was a robot that we had that fear the like it also how to make their project in their products more like inclusive of other people.

646
01:25:24,450 --> 01:25:30,940
So anybody who's read it, they have to think they can make a connection to it even if they like.

647
01:25:31,740 --> 01:25:34,260
Yeah. So let me give you guys a little pep talk.

648
01:25:34,410 --> 01:25:44,190
Um, you have a lot of talent, and you're very smart and driven and motivated, and you're going to do you're going to create something incredible.

649
01:25:44,190 --> 01:25:50,280
And I've seen it time and time again, and I need you to have confidence in yourself to do that.

650
01:25:50,730 --> 01:25:53,880
I'm not the keeper of knowledge in this cause.

651
01:25:54,060 --> 01:25:57,660
I'm just a coach and a facilitator. That's my role.

652
01:25:58,230 --> 01:26:04,650
That's. That's it. The talent is over here, and I need you to believe in yourself through the course.

653
01:26:05,670 --> 01:26:14,520
And you know, when. If you feel like, you know, this is sort of outside your wheelhouse, there's so many resources to help you.

654
01:26:14,520 --> 01:26:20,490
And, you know, part of being a graduate and part of being a professional is utilizing your resources, you know,

655
01:26:21,060 --> 01:26:28,090
across the university and even your team members and even reaching out to me, as you know, we're having a problem here.

656
01:26:28,110 --> 01:26:31,439
How do we you know, what do you recommend here?

657
01:26:31,440 --> 01:26:35,429
I'm that's my job in this course to guide you in that way.

658
01:26:35,430 --> 01:26:44,340
So my my best advice to you is believe in yourself and believe in yourself right now as you embark on this course.

659
01:26:46,710 --> 01:26:51,210
So what are some key lessons and insights that you sort of drew from this scenario?

660
01:26:51,960 --> 01:26:56,580
You know, as you move forward, maybe for yourself or even just advice to your peers,

661
01:26:57,780 --> 01:27:06,120
you know, as we sort of move through this class together that the patient recently spoke.

662
01:27:06,200 --> 01:27:13,270
Yeah, yeah, definitely.

663
01:27:14,990 --> 01:27:20,700
Yeah. So communication is key. Um, I, I, I definitely can't read minds.

664
01:27:20,700 --> 01:27:28,680
I'm not sure any one else can. So we need to use our words, and we need to be proactive and communicate with each other.

665
01:27:31,670 --> 01:27:36,829
Yeah. Mean, like group organizing or like group planning as a group before.

666
01:27:36,830 --> 01:27:40,730
And we've got their benefits and rewards at the time.

667
01:27:40,740 --> 01:27:45,530
But I think sometimes in my life that had been like lay out like, okay,

668
01:27:45,530 --> 01:27:50,140
this is where I joined in because they're probably relying on you to like create the product.

669
01:27:50,150 --> 01:27:57,980
So having your own, like, organization amongst your group might be like the take away.

670
01:27:58,580 --> 01:28:07,580
Yeah. Helpful planning process. Yeah. So that group communication and process plan and even committing as a group to revisiting that

671
01:28:07,880 --> 01:28:13,310
because you can create a plan and it might need to change because maybe the dynamics change.

672
01:28:13,310 --> 01:28:19,120
The workload moves in a direction you didn't anticipate or, you know, stuff just comes up.

673
01:28:19,130 --> 01:28:25,250
So. Um, you know, I really encourage you to take it seriously and continue to revisit it.

674
01:28:25,880 --> 01:28:33,170
Um, the end it's okay to do and not to feel like, you know, we have problems, therefore we need each other.

675
01:28:33,170 --> 01:28:36,739
And this group is a mess. It never needs to be that way.

676
01:28:36,740 --> 01:28:43,190
Just, you know, in the professional world, you know, all groups sort of go like this.

677
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:46,999
So you can anticipate that, um, this semester as well.

678
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:51,110
And I really encourage you to just, you know, talk to each other and work through it.

679
01:28:51,110 --> 01:28:57,740
And I'm always here to help. Sometimes there are situations where you need to pull me in and say, you're not.

680
01:28:58,070 --> 01:29:01,630
I'm not leaving you alone to do that. Um, I'm here to support you.

681
01:29:01,640 --> 01:29:09,020
I'm not. So what are any other key lessons that you draw from this?

682
01:29:11,060 --> 01:29:16,510
Though we should keep in mind it's kind of stressing on like the processes that are decided on it,

683
01:29:16,760 --> 01:29:20,479
on the group, but also what you said like being flexible,

684
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:25,580
especially after you meet with the preceptor like under like most likely the processes will like need

685
01:29:25,580 --> 01:29:29,750
to shift because they will most likely already have their own processes set up in their organization.

686
01:29:30,110 --> 01:29:34,040
So trying to align also with that organization as well.

687
01:29:34,040 --> 01:29:39,409
So you're on the same page. Yeah. So just keeping an open mind, it's not going to be a straight line,

688
01:29:39,410 --> 01:29:44,930
but being ready to hop in the car and maybe go in a different direction when it's needed.

689
01:29:50,010 --> 01:29:53,220
Any questions, concerns, comments.

690
01:29:54,870 --> 01:30:02,010
I can address at this time. Okay.

691
01:30:02,020 --> 01:30:11,049
So that's all I have for you today. Bit of a short day, but you're first piece of homework is just to indicate your preferences,

692
01:30:11,050 --> 01:30:16,720
and then you'll see some messages from me around your groups and then we'll meet again next Friday.

693
01:30:16,780 --> 01:30:24,080
So have a wonderful weekend. Thank you, a.

694
01:30:37,580 --> 01:31:07,450
In 2008.

695
01:31:09,010 --> 01:31:28,950
He said he would never have done something I wanted to do because I'm so happy

696
01:31:28,950 --> 01:31:35,370
with the stories and I wanted to see what the potential is for me to do.

697
01:31:35,550 --> 01:31:44,370
I have my children, so go ahead and send me an email right now and I will make sure you get permission to get access to the families.

698
01:31:44,670 --> 01:31:48,180
Because like I said, I don't know. I think.

699
01:31:48,180 --> 01:31:56,910
Yeah. So if you can decide. Yeah. Yeah. Because they have like this.

700
01:31:57,150 --> 01:32:10,980
Oh yeah. I have no idea what I was thinking.

701
01:32:13,960 --> 01:32:21,220
I always think there's something about it for me.

702
01:32:22,770 --> 01:32:35,890
I think that's what's right and that's not a good thing. I don't ever want to say these things to you because I like my life.

703
01:32:36,160 --> 01:32:40,380
I really wanted to come forward and communication.

704
01:32:41,140 --> 01:32:56,220
Yeah. It's like, oh, I don't want to things friends.

705
01:32:56,230 --> 01:32:59,760
It's been like, I know that's true.

706
01:33:02,370 --> 01:33:05,550
Yeah, that's true.

707
01:33:05,640 --> 01:33:10,470
I don't even know how that works. Yeah, exactly.

708
01:33:12,620 --> 01:33:17,700
So I know, I know. That was interesting. But I'm like, yeah, I think so.

709
01:33:19,200 --> 01:33:22,380
Yeah. I guess, you know, that you could also be like.

710
01:34:01,620 --> 01:34:07,079
Rethinking Risk Assessment with assessment or the risk assessment?

711
01:34:07,080 --> 01:34:11,370
6.24 oh needs assessment. What number is it?

712
01:34:11,430 --> 01:34:15,970
624. Now, you know.

713
01:34:18,360 --> 01:34:24,630
Oh, you haven't taken it all. 624.

714
01:34:26,460 --> 01:34:34,010
No, I have I have 65, 1477 in the letter.

715
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:40,110
Oh. So how many? But as I say, how many?

716
01:34:40,110 --> 01:34:43,110
I think I just ended up dropping class.

717
01:34:50,150 --> 01:34:53,360
Between 14 to 14, I'm taking 18.

718
01:34:54,740 --> 01:34:58,070
I did have more and I ended up dropping this since they knew I was going to be.

719
01:34:58,820 --> 01:35:02,180
I needed some extra time outside. Okay.

720
01:35:02,450 --> 01:35:10,760
So I'm here and I'm taking 18 credits the semester. I'm taking very exciting classes, but it includes seven busses.

721
01:35:17,310 --> 01:35:23,520
I think I should be all set for the semester. I just talk to an attitude that I was on the wait list for three.

722
01:35:23,970 --> 01:35:28,540
I was able to. Absolutely. Oh, yeah.

723
01:35:29,110 --> 01:35:39,420
Plus this in this room next. Oh, no, I am done for my Fridays, but I just wanted to figure it out myself at the project breaking out here.

724
01:35:41,190 --> 01:35:45,000
Yeah, me too. I'm trying to think. So how do you access that ranking?

725
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:53,120
I go to the very bottom. Age and then of on projects.

726
01:35:55,340 --> 01:36:00,980
I'm on the mom route. I don't see any projects you see in a project. Six 4241.

727
01:36:02,480 --> 01:36:05,740
Is it click on assignments. That's right.

728
01:36:07,130 --> 01:36:12,380
Huh? Oh, the fall down. I realize I can't see the enemy there, but then.

729
01:36:12,930 --> 01:36:16,550
Oh, okay. Oh, and that's at the very bottom. Thank you.

730
01:36:23,730 --> 01:36:48,050
Is it a new project? Yeah. 15.

731
01:36:55,580 --> 01:37:00,170
I know the one I don't like. That's my mother. This is the HIV I don't like.

732
01:37:00,170 --> 01:37:08,190
I don't like these. And that's going to be the before I number one is Community Action Network Project two as a cinema.

733
01:37:08,630 --> 01:37:09,620
Yeah. What is that?

734
01:37:10,010 --> 01:37:17,750
Project two is information materials for community members about smoking cessation, healthy eating and managing mental health and well-being.

735
01:37:18,470 --> 01:37:24,740
Oh, that's nice. But then the group has to decide on that advice because which is what?

736
01:37:24,740 --> 01:37:28,309
We all only get to select the organization when we get into groups.

737
01:37:28,310 --> 01:37:31,820
We this one does have two groups for Community Action Network.

738
01:37:31,820 --> 01:37:35,780
So you have to choose project one or Project two. Oh, really?

739
01:37:35,870 --> 01:37:39,640
Yeah. So you go on the ranking page, it's like two separate. Oh.

740
01:37:39,980 --> 01:37:45,790
Oh, yeah. Like no one's. I feel like I've done a lot of coping.

741
01:37:45,870 --> 01:37:52,080
That's probably. Yeah, I think can I like that? I see managing mental health because I'm really interested in mental health.

742
01:37:52,110 --> 01:37:55,709
Yeah. So I can watch it.

743
01:37:55,710 --> 01:38:04,430
One. On this project to my.

744
01:38:50,040 --> 01:39:27,360
Oh. So we get to bring five. So for chronic disease intervention, which you choose.

745
01:39:28,170 --> 01:39:32,579
I signed up for heart disease. I signed up for depression. I really wanted to do.

746
01:39:32,580 --> 01:39:37,130
I was, like, debating because, like, that would be a space of understand.

747
01:39:37,470 --> 01:39:43,560
And I was like, I haven't worked on heart disease or like I was trying to pick something that I hadn't worked on quite yet.

748
01:39:44,040 --> 01:39:48,060
So I think this class will bounce it out if I do work on this that incorporates mental health.

749
01:39:48,780 --> 01:39:52,530
Okay, that's good, because I would like to go on with your speech.

750
01:39:52,530 --> 01:39:55,690
So I really want to focus on this mental health. Yeah.

751
01:39:55,860 --> 01:40:01,350
On every project I have been doing, the program has been mostly 99.9%.

752
01:40:02,400 --> 01:40:04,170
Yeah, a lot of it is.

753
01:40:04,950 --> 01:40:11,520
In general, what I'm like working at is like more preventative measures of like chronic diseases which incorporates mental health.

754
01:40:11,880 --> 01:40:18,060
But our psychosis, heart disease is so prevalent and like there is a huge like preventative factor to that.

755
01:40:18,540 --> 01:40:20,160
Yeah, I was like, okay.

756
01:40:20,250 --> 01:40:27,450
And making like choose this like, you know, I was thinking mental health is just like the foundation of all the chronic conditions.

757
01:40:27,450 --> 01:40:28,230
It is. Yeah.

758
01:40:28,260 --> 01:40:36,450
It's like it's, you know, it's interesting that like a world like separates mental and physical health from like it's all like your body is one.

759
01:40:36,750 --> 01:40:40,800
Yeah. Like your physical health affects your mental health, your mental health.

760
01:40:41,070 --> 01:40:44,390
Physical health. Like, it's all interconnected, right?

761
01:40:44,430 --> 01:40:48,510
So I guess mental health is all the causation. Yeah. So.

762
01:40:49,910 --> 01:40:53,480
Maybe that's another good thing on mental health into heart disease.

763
01:40:53,810 --> 01:40:57,590
Yeah. Yeah. Well, would you allow you to do that?

764
01:40:58,430 --> 01:41:07,460
Because this depression, mental health type of heart disease, there's probably a mental there's definitely like a mental health aspect rises.

765
01:41:07,470 --> 01:41:14,560
I wonder what a lot of people experience because I guess with heart disease is mostly nutrition, you know, like preventative.

766
01:41:14,690 --> 01:41:21,269
Yeah. Like exercise. Because you've had some kind of progression because some positions you cannot exercise.

767
01:41:21,270 --> 01:41:24,290
So. Yeah, yeah. So it depends. Yeah.

768
01:41:25,480 --> 01:41:29,580
You. And. All right, have a nice weekend.

769
01:41:29,610 --> 01:41:33,330
I just talked to a lady. No, I stopped the later one. Hey, you want to take some?

770
01:41:33,570 --> 01:41:36,980
Someone gave this to me. Oh. I have.

771
01:41:37,200 --> 01:41:40,310
Actually, I just. One person said, you take all these.

772
01:41:40,740 --> 01:41:44,070
All of that. I have so much more, right? No, no. This is for us.

773
01:41:44,100 --> 01:41:52,410
Someone gave me these yesterday. I drove to the joy to make a donation, and they gave us a fishing boat.

774
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:57,180
And you. You can take it. Have a nice weekend.

775
01:42:03,070 --> 01:42:07,620
Yeah. I love gratitude, too. Yeah.

776
01:42:08,040 --> 01:42:11,890
You. I think a lot of people choose.

777
01:42:13,230 --> 01:42:16,530
The two bills behind these ads are most likely going to be one of the.

778
01:42:17,160 --> 01:42:21,090
It sounds like their top choice was like the HIV. Oh, that's good.

779
01:42:21,100 --> 01:42:24,180
That's my list. And that's my last thing that I was like, Oh, good.

780
01:42:25,400 --> 01:42:29,040
I don't want to be on that one. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Nothing. I mean, that's fine.

781
01:42:29,430 --> 01:42:33,990
This is too much. No, take it off. I if I had another bag, I would just, like, separate it.

782
01:42:34,110 --> 01:42:37,810
No, no. You please take it all. Okay.

783
01:42:38,370 --> 01:42:42,540
Thank you. I'll add it to my breakfast. What do you mean, brunch?

784
01:42:43,470 --> 01:42:49,560
It's already. Oh, no, I mean more and more. All right.

785
01:42:49,590 --> 01:43:29,980
I'll see you soon. All right. Okay.

786
01:55:11,890 --> 01:55:17,080
But that's not the feeling.

787
01:55:37,940 --> 02:00:25,940
I mean. I.

788
02:00:59,290 --> 02:06:17,030
If you. Even.

789
02:11:53,880 --> 02:12:07,020
Yeah. And.

790
02:13:05,580 --> 02:14:21,670
Yeah. No pounding drum, no name calling on someone who does some alone time.

791
02:14:21,830 --> 02:15:34,750
Only some. So.

792
02:16:00,500 --> 02:16:04,090
Right? Yeah, we're not.

793
02:16:19,680 --> 02:16:19,990
Any.
