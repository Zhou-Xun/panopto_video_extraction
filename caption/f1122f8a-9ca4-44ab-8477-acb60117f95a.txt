1
00:00:09,709 --> 00:00:13,505
In this module, I'm going to
describe to you a physical hazard.

2
00:00:13,505 --> 00:00:16,575
What if I told you that
there was an invisible and

3
00:00:16,575 --> 00:00:20,965
odorless hazard to which many
millions of Americans are exposed and

4
00:00:20,965 --> 00:00:26,125
that this particular hazard is the second
leading cause of lung cancer in America.

5
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:29,935
What if I also went on to tell you that
this is something that's easily measured

6
00:00:29,935 --> 00:00:31,475
and easily controlled.

7
00:00:31,475 --> 00:00:32,985
Well, hopefully that's got your attention.

8
00:00:32,985 --> 00:00:34,425
Let's go ahead and move forward and

9
00:00:34,425 --> 00:00:38,230
I'm going to tell you a little
bit more about radon.

10
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:39,570
So what is radon?

11
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:42,430
Radon is actually a naturally
occurring radioactive gas?

12
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:43,830
As I said, it's colorless.

13
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:44,770
It's odorless.

14
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:45,620
It's tasteless.

15
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:49,130
It's actually the heaviest
gas that occurs in nature.

16
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:50,000
Where does it come from?

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,150
Well, actually it comes from radioactive
decay of uranium that's below our feet

18
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:56,870
in soil and rock and groundwater.

19
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:00,532
And as you can see in the image
here as the radon gas is emitted,

20
00:01:00,532 --> 00:01:04,670
it tends to travel upwards towards
the air in the atmosphere.

21
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:09,378
The problem is as it does that, it emits
ionizing radiation and so radon and

22
00:01:09,378 --> 00:01:13,118
uranium will decay into different
radioactive isotopes or

23
00:01:13,118 --> 00:01:16,790
daughters as they're known.

24
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:21,180
The key issue with radon is that
it's everywhere potentially.

25
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:24,820
There's a lot of variation in how much
of it is present in different parts of

26
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:28,460
the United States or in the state
of Michigan as you see here and

27
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:32,720
that variation is due to differences
in geology and soil composition.

28
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,550
So we're looking at a map of
the state of Michigan here and

29
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,330
you'll see the map is
actually color coded.

30
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:43,403
So the dark green counties on this map are
counties in which at least one quarter or

31
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:46,355
25% of homes are equal to or

32
00:01:46,355 --> 00:01:51,800
expected to exceed the recommended
guideline of 4 picocuries per liter.

33
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:56,740
So that's a measure of a radiation
concentration per a liter of air in

34
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:57,930
this case.

35
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:00,530
So dark green are the most heavily or

36
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:03,740
highly exposed counties,
like green are less exposed.

37
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:07,946
And then the yellowish color is
the lowest concentration counties.

38
00:02:07,946 --> 00:02:11,377
So 1 to 9% of homes above this guideline.

39
00:02:11,377 --> 00:02:15,056
So if we zoom in here and look at
Washtenaw County where we are here at

40
00:02:15,056 --> 00:02:18,670
the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor,
or you can see that about

41
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:24,490
38% of homes are tested above this
4 picocuries per liter guideline.

42
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:27,310
Now we can also zoom out and
look at this at the national level and

43
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:30,510
again due to variations in geology and
soil composition.

44
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:34,570
We have actually tremendous differences
overall in the United States about

45
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:38,230
one in fifteen homes are in
the highest radon level category.

46
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:42,590
So this map is also color coded but the
codes have a slightly different meaning

47
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:46,460
the darkest red color on the map
here are counties where the average

48
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:51,240
indoor radon level is above that
guideline of 4 picocuries per liter.

49
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:55,030
The lighter red is counties with
an average indoor concentration

50
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:57,640
of 2 to 4 picocuries per liter and

51
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:02,620
the yellowish color is counties that are
below to picocuries per liter on average.

52
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:06,220
So again, you can see that there's
a substantial amount of variation

53
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:10,960
geographically here where Southeast
Michigan is very much in the the highest

54
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:15,660
exposure zone, much of the upper
plains and Intermountain West and

55
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:19,930
also some of the East Coast
particularly the Northeast have

56
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:24,950
again areas with the highest
concentrations of radon.

57
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:26,800
Why are we worried about radon?

58
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,055
Well, it turns out that radon as it
decays emits a type of radiation called

59
00:03:31,055 --> 00:03:32,232
an alpha particle.

60
00:03:32,232 --> 00:03:35,780
And alpha particles are very powerful,
but they're also very easily stopped.

61
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:38,820
They can be stopped for
example by a single sheet of paper or

62
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:42,320
by a dead layer of skin on
the outside of your body.

63
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:46,650
The problem becomes if you inhale these
alpha particles as radon emits, and

64
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:49,990
they get into your lungs and
now they're in very close contact with

65
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:53,330
extremely sensitive
tissues your lung cells.

66
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:56,247
So you end up getting now
a radiation of your airways and

67
00:03:56,247 --> 00:03:58,411
this unfortunately can lead to cancer.

68
00:03:58,411 --> 00:04:02,960
So the EPA has declared radon
to be a class a carcinogen.

69
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:07,920
This is a substance that's known
to cause cancer in humans.

70
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,480
As I said earlier, radon is the second
leading cause of lung cancer in the US.

71
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,980
I probably don't have to ask you what the
first is but let's just acknowledge it,

72
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,780
it's tobacco smoking.

73
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:23,020
The US EPA estimates that there's
about a 157,000 lung cancer deaths

74
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:29,722
that occurred in the US in 1995, of which
about 21,000 or 13% were related to radon.

75
00:04:29,722 --> 00:04:33,073
One of the problems with radon is
unfortunately after your exposed,

76
00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:38,140
there aren't any warning symptoms or
signs that you've been exposed.

77
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,220
So how bad is radon exposure?

78
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:43,100
It turns out the radon
causes far more deaths than

79
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:46,290
other events that are more
commonly viewed as risky.

80
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:50,861
So as I said about 21,000
deaths from radon in 1995,

81
00:04:50,861 --> 00:04:56,034
that's far more than were killed by
drunk driving or by falls in homes or

82
00:04:56,034 --> 00:04:59,854
by people drowning or
by people dying in home fires.

83
00:04:59,854 --> 00:05:04,424
And there's one particular subset of the
population that is extremely at risk from

84
00:05:04,424 --> 00:05:06,330
radon and that's smokers.

85
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:11,075
So smokers turn out to be 9 times more
likely to get lung cancer from radon than

86
00:05:11,075 --> 00:05:13,770
non-smokers and in fact radon accounts for

87
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:18,720
about 1 in 4 lung cancer
deaths among smokers.

88
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,690
What exposure standards do we
have to protect us from radon?

89
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:26,060
It turns out there's no known safe level
of radon as I've already mentioned,

90
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:29,810
radon is quantified using this
unit of picocuries per liter.

91
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:33,260
So that's a representation of
the concentration of radiation

92
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:35,950
in a liter of air or water.

93
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:39,460
Now the EPA has done surveys of
homes around the United States and

94
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:42,270
they've estimated that
inside homes on average.

95
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:46,470
The concentration is about
1.3 picocuries per liter, but

96
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:49,120
of course,
there's radon in outside air too, and

97
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:54,800
the concentration there on average
is about 0.4 picocuries per liter.

98
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,750
So the US EPA has set an action level and

99
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,750
I mentioned this number before
of 4 picocuries per liter.

100
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:05,060
Basically about ten times higher
concentration inside homes.

101
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:09,980
That's allowable compared to that
average outside concentration.

102
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,100
How do we measure rate on?

103
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,270
Well, it turns out this is
actually pretty easy to measure

104
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:16,880
radon is a very heavy gas
as I mentioned already.

105
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,840
So what we're going to do is
look at the lowest level of

106
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,110
a home that you actually live in where
that heavy gas is going to accumulate.

107
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:25,460
And we can do two types of testing,

108
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:29,360
their short-term testing which
can last between two and 90 days.

109
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,580
You can see an image here of
a radon test kit that's good for

110
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,420
a three to seven day test.

111
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:37,370
This is basically just a charcoal
tube that you open and

112
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:40,010
put in the lowest level of
your home that you live in.

113
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:44,700
Leave it open for the test period duration
and then you send it to a laboratory and

114
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:47,610
they tell you how much radon was measured.

115
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:51,990
So this is a great screening test to
very quickly assess for exposure.

116
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:56,270
We can also do a longer term test though
that might last between three months and

117
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,730
one full year.

118
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:02,660
The idea here is that radiation actually
can vary quite substantially by distance.

119
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:06,050
In fact, your neighbor may have none and
you may have a huge problem.

120
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,700
But it also varies by season.

121
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:10,183
It tends to be higher in the winter and
lower in the summer.

122
00:07:10,183 --> 00:07:14,920
So with the long-term test of three months
to a year we can get a more accurate idea

123
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,030
of your long-term average level.

124
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:20,520
Now, it turns out that January
is National Radon Action month.

125
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:24,581
So I would encourage you when January
rolls around or before to do a test at

126
00:07:24,581 --> 00:07:28,054
your home and the great news is
these test kits particularly.

127
00:07:28,054 --> 00:07:31,674
The short-term ones are probably
available from your local government or

128
00:07:31,674 --> 00:07:35,415
public health department and
they often cost only 10 to 15 dollars.

129
00:07:35,415 --> 00:07:39,905
So a very inexpensive test
to assess your health risk.

130
00:07:39,905 --> 00:07:42,185
How do we actually get exposed to radon?

131
00:07:42,185 --> 00:07:43,795
How does it travel
through the environment?

132
00:07:43,795 --> 00:07:47,520
Well, as I've mentioned already most of
the exposure we're concerned about is

133
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,200
either in homes or commercial
buildings indoors in other words, and

134
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,400
there's two primary issues.

135
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,110
We're working with here one is the air
pressure differential between gas in

136
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:58,900
the ground and gas in the atmosphere.

137
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,850
And the second is what's
called a stack effect,

138
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:05,370
which tends to make hotter are move
upwards through a structure.

139
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:08,130
You'll see in the image here, there's
a couple of different pathways that

140
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:12,100
are highlighted for how radon gets
into and moves throughout our house.

141
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:15,250
So we might have cavities or
gaps in our walls.

142
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:18,600
We might have cracks in the floor
that the gas can travel through

143
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,920
there are construction joints.

144
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,742
For example, where walls meet or
ceiling meets a wall.

145
00:08:22,742 --> 00:08:25,570
There might be cracks in
the walls below ground level.

146
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:27,100
For example in your basement.

147
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:31,386
There can be gaps basically in the floors
of your home that allow the radon to

148
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:32,622
continue to spread.

149
00:08:32,622 --> 00:08:36,691
The gas can also move through cracks just
in your wall and then you're going to have

150
00:08:36,691 --> 00:08:40,519
gaps potentially around the service
pipes that enter and exit your home and

151
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:45,520
also move within your home and
the gas can follow those gaps as well.

152
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:49,900
So the good news here in terms of how
we can reduce radon exposure is there

153
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,180
are many ways.

154
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:55,470
In fact, if your home is built in
a high radon zone according to the EPA,

155
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:58,560
it has to include some radon
features to start with.

156
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,430
One is that the home is built on
a gravel layer that's gas permeable.

157
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:04,268
So that's underneath your foundation.

158
00:09:04,268 --> 00:09:09,090
It lets the rate on move very freely under
your foundation and away from your home.

159
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:12,450
And then on top of that gravel
layer is a plastic sheet

160
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:15,350
underneath the slab that your
home sits on and that plastic.

161
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:20,150
Is impermeable or
impenetrable to radon on existing homes?

162
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,280
We can do a couple things.

163
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:25,100
So one is seal up cracks in basements and
walls and

164
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,910
another is to add what's
called sub-slab suction.

165
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:31,640
This basically means you drill
a hole in your foundation and

166
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:36,310
you hollow out some Earth underneath and
then you have a fan connected to a pipe

167
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:39,600
and the fan basically sucks radon
from underneath your house and

168
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,030
ejects it at the top of your house where
it can safely degrade in the atmosphere.

169
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,210
So I said, this is good news.

170
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:48,490
And indeed it is these very simple
controls which often only cost a few

171
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:51,690
hundred dollars can actually
reduce your radon exposures by

172
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:53,980
up to ninety nine percent.

173
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:57,190
It's also possible for you to have
radon in your drinking water and

174
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:58,710
here again, we have options.

175
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:02,920
So there's sort of two approaches one is
to treat the raid on contaminated water as

176
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,620
it comes into your home
sort of a single treatment

177
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,620
approach that can be very effective.

178
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,822
There are also so-called
point-of-use approaches.

179
00:10:10,822 --> 00:10:14,262
This would be for example,
putting a filter on your faucet,

180
00:10:14,262 --> 00:10:17,520
but that's a less effective and
more expensive method.

181
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:21,480
So again here we've got a hazard
that many of us are exposed to.

182
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,952
We know it can cause a very bad health
outcome, but the good news is it's

183
00:10:24,952 --> 00:10:29,072
very easy to measure and it's very
easy to correct if you find a problem.

184
00:10:29,072 --> 00:10:33,102
So this is an example of a hazard that
has huge potential to harm people but

185
00:10:33,102 --> 00:10:36,437
that is very easily managed.
