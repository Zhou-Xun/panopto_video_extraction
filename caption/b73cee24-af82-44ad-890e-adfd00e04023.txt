00:00:08,869 --> 00:00:13,348
Today we're gonna continue building your skills on eliciting change talk.

2
00:00:13,348 --> 00:00:18,306
We're gonna provide you with a couple of concrete strategies that will help you

3
00:00:18,306 --> 00:00:19,268
manufacture or

4
00:00:19,268 --> 00:00:23,646
extract it when you don't have enough of it organically to work with.

5
00:00:23,646 --> 00:00:26,586
Now just remind yourselves what is change talk.

6
00:00:26,586 --> 00:00:29,286
It's the expression of the patient of why would be good for

7
00:00:29,286 --> 00:00:30,672
me to get rid of this problem?

8
00:00:30,672 --> 00:00:33,427
Or why would be good for me to start this behavior?

9
00:00:33,427 --> 00:00:36,764
How it might be discrepant with my roles, goals, and values?

10
00:00:36,764 --> 00:00:41,565
How my life would be better without this in my life?

11
00:00:41,565 --> 00:00:45,748
Let's talk about how do we accomplish the extraction or

12
00:00:45,748 --> 00:00:48,156
the generation of change talk?

13
00:00:48,156 --> 00:00:51,586
The first technique is what we call looking ahead.

14
00:00:51,586 --> 00:00:57,671
We typically ask about a behavior using the magic wand principle.

15
00:00:57,671 --> 00:00:58,966
Here's a magic wand.

16
00:00:58,966 --> 00:01:02,938
You're smoking is gone, your weight is normal, you're exercising,

17
00:01:02,938 --> 00:01:04,770
your diabetes is under control.

18
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:07,609
Look ahead a year from now, maybe five years from now,

19
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:10,456
depending on the condition, what's your life like?

20
00:01:10,456 --> 00:01:12,078
Tell me how you're feeling.

21
00:01:12,078 --> 00:01:16,731
Let them get into that virtual reality and explain it to you.

22
00:01:16,731 --> 00:01:19,631
You could give them prompts like how would your life be different?

23
00:01:19,631 --> 00:01:20,969
How might it impact your life?

24
00:01:20,969 --> 00:01:24,227
What would it feel like to be in that body?

25
00:01:24,227 --> 00:01:29,369
All of those prompts are trying to elicit change talk from the patient.

26
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:34,927
We wanted to get excited about the possibility of life without this problem.

27
00:01:34,927 --> 00:01:36,830
That's looking ahead.

28
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:39,144
Now, a variation and theme is looking back.

29
00:01:39,144 --> 00:01:43,104
Sometimes, you get the change talk by the person saying you know what,

30
00:01:43,104 --> 00:01:44,099
I used to do this.

31
00:01:44,099 --> 00:01:47,715
So a very good example is something like physical activity.

32
00:01:47,715 --> 00:01:51,523
When we're trying to add a behavior as opposed to subtract a behavior,

33
00:01:51,523 --> 00:01:52,799
smoking and drinking.

34
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,780
But if you wanna add a behavior and they used to do it,

35
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,717
they were a college athlete, you might say, hey,

36
00:01:56,717 --> 00:01:59,438
going back when you were in your 20's, how did it feel to be self fit?

37
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:01,251
How did it feel to be such a good soccer player?

38
00:02:01,251 --> 00:02:04,408
How'd it feel to be on the gymnastics team?

39
00:02:04,408 --> 00:02:07,128
What was it like to be in that body?

40
00:02:07,128 --> 00:02:11,711
So then get me excited, but we're looking backwards to get the excitement,

41
00:02:11,711 --> 00:02:13,130
to get the change talk.

42
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:17,034
Now, the second strategy I wanna talk about today are the importance and

43
00:02:17,034 --> 00:02:18,186
confidence rulers.

44
00:02:18,186 --> 00:02:22,172
They're probably the single most widely used strategy for

45
00:02:22,172 --> 00:02:24,569
manufacturing change talk and MI.

46
00:02:24,569 --> 00:02:28,824
And it starts with two simple prompts, on a scale of zero to 10 with zero not at all

47
00:02:28,824 --> 00:02:31,492
important, 10 being the most important thing.

48
00:02:31,492 --> 00:02:35,274
How important is it for you to change blank, smoking, diet,

49
00:02:35,274 --> 00:02:37,470
exercise your medical adherence?

50
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:41,435
Number two, on a scale of zero to 10 with zero not at all, and 10 being very

51
00:02:41,435 --> 00:02:45,468
confident, how confident are you if you decided to change you would succeed?

52
00:02:45,468 --> 00:02:50,383
Now, when they give you their numbers, we ask up to three probes.

53
00:02:50,383 --> 00:02:52,008
We usually don't ask all three, but

54
00:02:52,008 --> 00:02:55,009
I want you to be aware that they have slightly different functions.

55
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:56,788
Let's start with the first one.

56
00:02:56,788 --> 00:02:59,560
This is the one we almost always ask.

57
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,540
You picked a blank let's say a six, why not a lower number?

58
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:06,412
The reason we almost always ask why not lower,

59
00:03:06,412 --> 00:03:09,806
is cuz that's the probe that will elicit change talk.

60
00:03:09,806 --> 00:03:11,599
Now the next two is a judgment call.

61
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,238
They're very helpful, but you have to be prepared.

62
00:03:14,238 --> 00:03:16,627
They don't always generate change talk.

63
00:03:16,627 --> 00:03:18,321
The second probe is why not a higher number?

64
00:03:18,321 --> 00:03:20,049
Why didn't you pick an eight or a nine?

65
00:03:20,049 --> 00:03:21,596
Why did you pick a six and not a higher number?

66
00:03:21,596 --> 00:03:23,877
Now that's gonna get sustain talk.

67
00:03:23,877 --> 00:03:27,664
Now it also in a more positive sense might build rapport, during the swamp.

68
00:03:27,664 --> 00:03:29,783
So if you haven't already done that,

69
00:03:29,783 --> 00:03:32,374
asking why not higher will help achieve that.

70
00:03:32,374 --> 00:03:34,928
The third one is what would it take to get to a higher number?

71
00:03:34,928 --> 00:03:36,444
Now that's where you're gonna get your solutions.

72
00:03:36,444 --> 00:03:40,294
Most of the time, that would be change talk, sometimes it backfires.

73
00:03:40,294 --> 00:03:41,464
Here's a case that could backfire.

74
00:03:41,464 --> 00:03:46,252
Well, if I had a personal chef like Oprah, or I guess if I had a heart attack and

75
00:03:46,252 --> 00:03:50,033
was unable to speak then maybe I would do something about it.

76
00:03:50,033 --> 00:03:52,517
So that's not the type of solution we're looking for.

77
00:03:52,517 --> 00:03:58,136
We're ideally looking for solutions that are meaningful and manageable right now.

78
00:03:58,136 --> 00:04:02,384
So a lot of people ask, why does motivational interviewing partition

79
00:04:02,384 --> 00:04:07,212
motivation into these two orthogonal elements, confidence and importance?

80
00:04:07,212 --> 00:04:08,505
And the reason is this,

81
00:04:08,505 --> 00:04:12,392
we feel your motivation is the product of your importance confidence.

82
00:04:12,392 --> 00:04:16,507
I need to know both dimensions, to know what to do next with you.

83
00:04:16,507 --> 00:04:17,631
What do we mean?

84
00:04:17,631 --> 00:04:20,797
Let's look on the bottom right, can't but wants to.

85
00:04:20,797 --> 00:04:24,269
That's someone who says you know what, I really wanna quit smoking, but

86
00:04:24,269 --> 00:04:26,009
I have no confidence I'll succeed.

87
00:04:26,009 --> 00:04:27,653
That's a can't, but wants to.

88
00:04:27,653 --> 00:04:31,118
Well that person, we're gonna talk about later,

89
00:04:31,118 --> 00:04:34,268
probably needs to build their self advocacy.

90
00:04:34,268 --> 00:04:37,194
On the upper left, we have a can but doesn't want to.

91
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:41,131
That person feels I can do it, I just don't see why it's important.

92
00:04:41,131 --> 00:04:43,556
I'm only Â£5 overweight, I can lose those five pounds but

93
00:04:43,556 --> 00:04:45,410
I don't really see that that's important.

94
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,399
That person needs to drive importance.

95
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:52,090
We may wanna use a different activity than the person who's a can't but wants to.

96
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:54,172
Just a quick note.

97
00:04:54,172 --> 00:04:55,524
Some people don't like the rulers.

98
00:04:55,524 --> 00:04:59,429
So it's rare, but you'll find someone who says I don't know what you mean higher or

99
00:04:59,429 --> 00:05:01,084
lower, I can't put a number on it.

100
00:05:01,084 --> 00:05:05,388
If you run into that, simply ask this prose question, prose.

101
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:10,100
This will get you the same change talk as the three probes would get you from

102
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,473
the ruler activity.

103
00:05:11,473 --> 00:05:14,630
Just tell me some of the pros and cons, good things, bad things, what's worked for

104
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:15,970
you, what hasn't worked for you.

105
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:26,674
This will get at the same information except, sands the numerical trick.

106
00:05:26,674 --> 00:05:31,003
So today we've introduced you to two important strategies to elicit or

107
00:05:31,003 --> 00:05:32,382
extract change talk.

108
00:05:32,382 --> 00:05:36,015
Looking forward and backwards, and the importance confidence rulers.

109
00:05:36,015 --> 00:05:39,351
This helps set the stage for our next strategy coming soon,

110
00:05:39,351 --> 00:05:43,877
which is the values and strengths clarification strategy.
