00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:08,090
Hello and welcome to the inaugural episode of Open Air, a discussion of the impacts of climate change on rural communities.

2
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:11,810
I am your host, Dr. Rob Davidson. I'm happy you tuned in.

3
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:17,150
I have 20 years of experience working in a rural emergency department in a Waco county in West Michigan.

4
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:20,180
My career has been dedicated to ensuring the health of the members of the

5
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:24,290
community that I serve as climate change is impacting the health of my patients.

6
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:28,340
I felt that it was important to bring you this information. In this episode,

7
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:31,670
I would like to spend a little time talking about the evidence supporting climate change

8
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:36,980
and ways in which a changing climate can impact rural communities in our next episode.

9
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:45,810
I will take us through some scenarios where local impacts of climate change can and are having an impact on the health of the people of West Michigan.

10
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:54,210
First, what is climate change? Climate change refers to the increase in global average temperature since the 1950s.

11
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:57,870
Human activity has contributed greatly to the rising average temperature,

12
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:03,180
particularly in the increase production of greenhouse gases since the rise of industrialization

13
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:09,750
from 1950 on greenhouse gases absorb heat from the sun and trap it in the Earth's atmosphere.

14
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:13,080
The most common greenhouse gas is carbon dioxide.

15
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:21,180
Over the last 70 years, levels of carbon dioxide have dramatically increased to levels not seen for at least 800000 years.

16
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:27,150
As carbon dioxide levels have gone up, the average temperature of the Earth has risen to levels never before seen

17
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:32,700
and is projected to increase at a rate and to levels that are unprecedented.

18
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:37,410
Many of you may have heard of climate change and thought, why should I care?

19
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:44,580
A lot of what you hear about climate change has to do with melting polar ice caps, rising sea levels, deadly hurricanes and vicious wildfires.

20
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:50,630
So why should you living in the rural Midwest, care about those events that happen so far away from you?

21
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:56,420
Warming of the Earth has led to more extreme weather events like increased heavy rainfall leading to flooding.

22
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:59,900
This leads to increased agricultural runoff into streams, rivers and lakes.

23
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:07,130
Increasing nitrates and phosphates in those bodies of water algal blooms and high bacterial counts become more frequent,

24
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:11,060
leading to beach closures and threats to the supply of safe drinking water.

25
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:16,670
Algal blooms and higher water temperatures can lead to increased invasive species in the Great Lakes and connected waterways,

26
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:23,450
threatening native fish species. Shortened winters and earlier loss of ice cover on lakes from rising temperatures

27
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:28,430
decreases the time for winter recreation activities like ice fishing, snowmobiling and skiing.

28
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:35,150
Hotter summers leads to increased cost of cooling your home, higher risk of heat related illness, earlier and longer allergy seasons.

29
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:42,110
With higher pollen counts affecting health, the longer summer can lead to increase in some crops.

30
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:48,860
But the extremes of weather and temperature has led to increased likelihood of spring cold versus like in 2002 and 2012,

31
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:54,260
when tart cherry crops were destroyed, significantly impacting the $60 million industry.

32
00:02:54,260 --> 00:03:00,820
These are projected to increase in the years to come. Threatening other crops, all due to climate change.

33
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,310
The extremes of temperature aren't reserved for hot summers,

34
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:07,330
as extreme low temperatures in the winter have been more frequent due to Arctic warming and

35
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:12,550
shifts in the Arctic jetstream south and are projected to continue to be more frequent.

36
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:20,650
Remember the polar vortex of 2019? Some Michigan areas saw wind chills of negative 45 degrees Fahrenheit in isolated rural areas.

37
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:25,160
Extreme cold like this increased the risk of hypothermia and death.

38
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:32,510
As you can see, a changing climate has had and will continue to have far reaching impacts across the globe,

39
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:38,720
but can also have significant impacts on agriculture, recreation and health here in rural West Michigan.

40
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,930
Thank you for listening, and please tune in to our next podcast,

41
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:49,461
where we will explore in more depth the specific impacts of climate change in our area of rural West Michigan.
