1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:10,639
Oh. Yeah.

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:14,310
And. Hmm. I think.

3
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:25,290
But. Yes.

4
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:51,140
Already this year. All right.

5
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:16,780
Good morning. But.

6
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:34,810
Just wanted to quickly introduce myself. My name's Ariana.

7
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:39,280
Oh, no, I don't. Well, this is class.

8
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:45,540
Last week's class was the first time I was here in person because I was traveling and so, so many different times.

9
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:50,250
So I was like, oh, man, I need to actually introduce myself. And then I had class, like, right afterwards.

10
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:56,530
Anyway, I just want to say hi to her for a month. Then I never even spoke with you.

11
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:03,290
The things or. See her on time.

12
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:28,170
Just. Just. Do they work?

13
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,460
I think so. Oh yeah. Was the I didn't work out in the car, so.

14
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:36,900
Yeah. Oh, how are you? Okay.

15
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:41,690
What's that? Actually, the housekeeping genes of the best.

16
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:59,460
Well, I like. Oh, well, that's like one of those, but I guess it's art gallery, you know, so you can be used on something like this.

17
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:05,159
Yeah, yeah. But the one I didn't design it was just.

18
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:09,950
Let me see. You have. Yeah.

19
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:13,130
Just the other one I really liked. Yeah.

20
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:20,600
Yeah. Well, we'll see. I stopped to check it on the fact I didn't really know my salary.

21
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:37,940
Our decision was more and more. Whatever you.

22
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:49,280
That's. Yeah.

23
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:23,110
And. There's this guy.

24
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:29,180
In our last music.

25
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:40,450
When I go to teach, I leave at 715, like.

26
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:58,730
Last year. I can tell you that I won't go without you at any time.

27
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:03,050
Just let me know. I'm on the phone.

28
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:08,060
All right, guys, I'm going to try to keep this really short. More time.

29
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:14,990
So the midterm is posted under assignments, so it should be there.

30
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:18,740
We at the bottom pass other quizzes that everything should be visible to you.

31
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,080
Let me know if you have any difficulties finding it.

32
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:27,260
It's essentially a word document, so you should be able to download it right from the assignments page.

33
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:34,700
You can it's word documents you download it, type in, complete it as an electronic document.

34
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:39,950
If you prefer it old school, you can print it out and fill it out as a manual exam.

35
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:43,220
Sometimes it actually works better for your thought process. Whatever works for you.

36
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:48,740
It is. Do remember we just did this because of Michigan and Sochi.

37
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:53,360
So it's actually do a little more than a week from now.

38
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,660
It's due Monday, October 17th. Okay.

39
00:07:56,690 --> 00:08:04,070
So that's to accommodate a lot of people are going to Michigan, to Sochi. So you have that extra weekend, but it's due Monday, October 17th at 10 a.m.

40
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:11,900
Okay. That is a very strict deadline because I have to correct these things before we get too far into the next portion of the class.

41
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:17,690
Okay. We will still have class. I know some of you won't be here because of Michigan to Sochi.

42
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,770
We will still have class on the 14th next Friday. Okay.

43
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:24,079
I'm going to go forward with the liver structure function. I'll record it.

44
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:29,780
So if you miss it, you can watch the lecture. But the exam will not be due to on Monday, October 17th,

45
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:36,530
at 10 a.m. If there's any sort of extenuating circumstances, you must have that pre-approved by me.

46
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:39,140
That has to be a pretty strict deadline. So you get those corrected.

47
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:47,210
You don't have to wait till 9:59 a.m. on Monday the 17th, and if you get done earlier, please feel free.

48
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,740
Submit it earlier so I can get a head start on correcting it. But that is the hard and fast deadline.

49
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:56,540
Okay. Preferably it should be turned in as a word or pdf file upload.

50
00:08:56,630 --> 00:09:00,710
So down at the bottom of this thing. Well, actually you're looking at it in student view.

51
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:04,940
There is a upload section so you can upload it.

52
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,410
Let me know if you have any difficulty with it.

53
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:13,610
If you complete it handwritten and can't scan it somehow, let me know and we'll arrange for you to turn it in.

54
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:22,340
But that deadline is pretty fast. Okay. The exam consists of 12 short answer or short essay questions.

55
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:25,550
There's a total of 60 points and then there's a bonus point.

56
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:34,940
The points are pretty even, or actually exactly even across all the different areas that we talked about in modules one through six.

57
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:42,500
So even though sometimes like if you have one area that you don't feel comfortable in, it shouldn't adversely impact you.

58
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:47,840
So they're spread evenly and the exam in total is 25% of your final grade.

59
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:54,500
So when I correct these things, so they're different from like the quizzes and that there's not really multiple choice,

60
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,470
there's not like one word, there's not just quick look it up,

61
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:04,489
regurgitate because that would be pointless and they come exam there are I mean some of them are pretty

62
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:10,700
straightforward it absolutely does follow the topics we discussed in class and the topics in your review sheets.

63
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,049
So I have a couple more points about that, but it's all there.

64
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:22,670
It just looks a little bit different, a little bit more a thought application. There is a pre written key and I'm grading for content.

65
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:33,049
So I know when people see like essay they tend to freak out, but their space on the exam is roughly equivalent to the length of answer and efficiency.

66
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:41,030
Conciseness is better. You'll actually lose points if you word salad it and just start throwing random words that don't make sense together.

67
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:47,150
You have to kind of the whole point is to show that you understand the concepts and kind of articulate and use them.

68
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:54,709
So it has to kind of make sense. So take your time and think about it before you just start spitting out whatever.

69
00:10:54,710 --> 00:11:00,980
That's why I'm giving it as a take home. So I remove that time pressure where you're just writing wildly, everything you can think of.

70
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:05,959
Okay, like I said, there's a pre-written key. It's not auto graded.

71
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:13,340
I don't delegate the grading and the way I do it, I read everybody's question one, everybody's question, too,

72
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:18,290
so that if there's something in the wording of the question and everybody's going off in some direction that I never thought of,

73
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:21,920
I can modify my cue accordingly. But basically I have a key.

74
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:26,120
I'm looking for certain things, but I'm also looking for the cohesiveness of the answer as a whole.

75
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:31,069
Okay. As you know, this is an open notes, open resource exam.

76
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:38,030
You can open the lecture, your notes, the video, you can look up stuff, whatever you want to do while taking it.

77
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:42,160
It is not enough. Don't get too frightened by the.

78
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,410
It's not necessary. Everything is stuff that we covered.

79
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:50,000
It's not necessary to go off on your own, you know, to go.

80
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:56,800
I've had some people just really go far afield with this, and that's just stress and that's just going to kind of waste your time a little bit.

81
00:11:56,810 --> 00:12:03,140
So my suggestion is really concentrate on the stuff we did in lecture, but it is absolutely allowed to look up whatever you want.

82
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:08,090
What you can't do is consult one another. It's not a group activity or other people.

83
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:13,880
So other instructors, other students. The only exception is you can ask me a clarifying question.

84
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:22,129
You can't say, Is this right? What will I get? I'm not going to correct your exam in real time, and I can't tell you the answer,

85
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:25,280
obviously, but I might be able to clarify it, put you in the right direction.

86
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:32,270
And if someone asks me a question that is relevant to the group as a whole, I'll be identify the question and just post it for everyone to see.

87
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:37,820
Okay, there is a space on the front page of your exam for your student ID and there's also a space for you to

88
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:42,590
sign or print your name affirming that you understand this and that this exam represents your own work.

89
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:47,420
Okay, here are my tips which are written on the exam as well.

90
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:55,550
Number one tip which sounds obvious is read the questions and make sure that you're actually answering the question that I'm asking.

91
00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:00,470
So a lot of times you just like read the question, you'll be like, Oh, there's something about inflammation and I should be off.

92
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:07,370
It happens more over the time the exam, but just really make sure that the answer you're writing down answers the actual question that I'm asking.

93
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:11,420
Okay. Like I said, be complete but concise, please.

94
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:14,060
I beg you, I'm green for content, not length.

95
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:19,129
So there are spaces on the exam, you know, if you're writing it out, some people write bigger than others.

96
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:23,960
But essentially the spaces I've given you roughly indicate the answer length I'm expecting.

97
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:29,570
I will tell you that even when I had in-class exams, it was a similar type of exam.

98
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:36,290
So in theory, if you like really have everything already in your head, in theory it's an exam that's doable in 2 hours.

99
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,960
I know it won't seem that way to you. And don't worry about cramming it into two words.

100
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:46,459
I want to remove that time pressure, but like you don't have to spend the entire week on this exam, okay?

101
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:50,600
Like I said, don't panic. The material on the exam is all closely tied to the lecture and the review sheets.

102
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:58,069
So, I mean, you might even want to print out a copy of the exam just so you can make notes to yourself, but think and plan out your answer.

103
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:03,290
If you don't understand the question, contact me so I can help clarify for a general guide.

104
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:07,340
I recommend spending no more than 3 to 5 hours on this exam.

105
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:11,660
Beyond that, you're going to be changing things. You're going to be driving herself crazy.

106
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:16,880
So my suggestion is that you set aside a two hour block of uninterrupted time earlier in the week,

107
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:23,990
pretend it's an exam period, go through the entire thing and try to answer the ones that you can or make notes like,

108
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:31,490
okay, this is something to do with regeneration, so you can go back later or write some bullets, whatever, to our block, uninterrupted time.

109
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:35,690
Put it aside, take a break, come back later in the day or the next day,

110
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:39,559
and then hit the ones like, Oh yeah, I needed to go back and look up at the neoplasia lecture.

111
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:45,530
What this is all about, flesh out the answers. Take another break, final read through and then be done.

112
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:47,839
Submit it, send it in when it's done.

113
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:55,069
Because beyond that period of time, really, people tend to like shoot themselves in the foot by changing answers.

114
00:14:55,070 --> 00:15:00,920
You almost always your first instinct is correct in terms of what you're putting.

115
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:05,630
Okay. Like I said, submit as a canvas file upload.

116
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:10,880
I don't know if you have it written down, just contact me and I'll figure out some way to turn it in.

117
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:16,340
But that deadline is Monday, October 17th at 10 a.m. okay.

118
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:23,150
For the people in 717, I know we have our methods sections that I believe we had do the 21st.

119
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:32,090
So that sounds familiar. So priority wise, this is first people in 717 and then methods is after that.

120
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:36,050
I mean, obviously you can do it at the same time, but this should take priority over that.

121
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:40,550
All right. The last page.

122
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:46,190
So there's 12 questions. The last one question or is just like histo question.

123
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:50,060
So it's like, what tissue is this? What cell is this? That's actually a nice warm up questions.

124
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:56,990
You might want to go to the end and do those first or if you get tired of the essay things in modules.

125
00:15:56,990 --> 00:16:00,770
So that's on the exam. I put those also.

126
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:07,280
This is just for question 12 as a PowerPoint here in case you want to see those a little bit bigger, those images.

127
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:12,440
So this is just the question 12 image slides so you don't do turn this in or anything,

128
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,830
but if you wanted to see the picture is a little bit bigger, that is there for you as well.

129
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,000
Okay. Does anyone have any questions?

130
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:27,930
Sure they'll come to you later. All right.

131
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:35,010
That is actually all that I had. Please, even if you're not going to work on it today, please download your exam.

132
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:40,590
Open it. Make sure it all works well for you so we can make sure there's no technical problems.

133
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:50,550
So, you know, today, if not today, tomorrow, please download your exam very, very soon so that you don't send me a message in a panic.

134
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,440
Sunday night, next week. But you can't download it. That would be bad.

135
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:01,510
All right. That is all that I have. So I'm going to let you go to it.

136
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:03,509
You certainly don't have to do the exam now,

137
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:07,650
but if you want to look at it and just see what's there and get your initial impression, you are free to do so.

138
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:18,450
And those of you in 717 who are there, who are in Group one, I will be seeing you at 130 up at and CRC and we'll have all the fun with them.

139
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:20,640
All right, thanks, guys.
