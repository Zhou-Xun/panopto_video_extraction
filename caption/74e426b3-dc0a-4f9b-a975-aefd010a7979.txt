1
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:12,110
Okay, my friend. But I have to tell you.

2
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:19,800
Yeah, I know.

3
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:23,760
I love you and I.

4
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:41,000
What are you really the or selling your fingers paper.

5
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:56,440
Your dad. Like, if I saw my dad acting the way I'd be, like, why are you talking about my husband once again?

6
00:00:56,530 --> 00:01:13,660
Because I didn't, like, ask him to see her because he doesn't even know the second or third way.

7
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:26,130
This is complete guide to the Galaxy.

8
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:44,300
Sitting on the bottom of sexual misconduct. You sit down and like nobody does to me.

9
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:52,120
Oh, my God.

10
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:59,240
I think I'm crazy.

11
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:08,180
Let's go ahead and. Exactly. You could have had a great weekend.

12
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:14,189
Before we get started, I would put your cue logistics.

13
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:23,909
So Wednesday your group work in groups last time and you have won the first part of your project.

14
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:27,240
Do this Friday. And remember, it's a draft,

15
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:38,100
but we voted for you to put forth your best effort with your drive so we can give you really good feedback around how you're presenting.

16
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:42,030
So I really want you to make sure you are.

17
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:53,250
Even though the draft I would like for you to make sure you have completed each other components to the best of your ability so we can give you that.

18
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:57,570
We do Friday. You have some time on Wednesday to work with your groups around that.

19
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:06,960
If you are already far along, I encourage you to use that group time to get started on your conceptual models, so just keep going.

20
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:17,880
These are nice opportunities with time carved out so you can save some time outside of your very busy work schedule.

21
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:25,350
In terms of meeting with your group, you all have a theory assessment do this week you'll just have that part of your

22
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:34,410
project do and then we'll re visit that the theory assessment that follows another.

23
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:39,580
Saying that Karen asked me to do a quote for you.

24
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:45,639
I believe she has sent this out to you guys, but just wanted to do a plug for our Student Alumni Mentoring program,

25
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:49,810
which is coordinated up to the school level. How many of you guys have signed up for this?

26
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:58,360
Yes. You and I can't underestimate how important it is to have a mentoring team.

27
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,179
So you have really an academic advisor assigned to you.

28
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:09,880
And then you may be you marry, have mentors in your life or other people that you consider a mentor as.

29
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:14,320
But this is a wonderful way to really round out a mentoring team for you.

30
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:23,320
And I've heard year after year from students that they love the opportunity to connect with alumni in this manner.

31
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:29,320
It's been a great networking opportunity for them in terms of them providing connections,

32
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:36,219
whether it's just people you want to connect with in the field or job opportunities,

33
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:41,730
things like that, and then just, you know, advice about being successful as a champion.

34
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:47,379
So I have only heard wonderful things about this mentoring program from students.

35
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:52,050
I really encourage you to give it a try, sign up for it.

36
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:59,000
So. I believe you get some instructions on this page.

37
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:07,400
You can access it on the school. So any questions about anything?

38
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:20,510
I just want to read before we dove into the contest. So today we're going to talk about self determination theory.

39
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:29,860
So I want to start off with this icebreaker before we dove into self determination.

40
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:34,880
There is no reason to think about promoting behavior that you currently practice.

41
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:44,730
And then why do you do it? So just think about is one behavior that you practice and you know, what is your reasoning finding?

42
00:05:52,210 --> 00:06:02,600
Have some volunteers share. I use olive oil instead of fire.

43
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:09,710
Why? Because it's higher and it's better for my arteries.

44
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:14,300
So you use olive oil instead of butter.

45
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,740
And the reason is because you know that it's better for your health.

46
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:23,200
There are. Okay. Thank you.

47
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:28,850
What about others? Yeah.

48
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:38,330
I don't eat salted peanuts. It's like, you know, heavily salted nuts.

49
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:44,150
And why? Why don't you do that? I'm allergic to them. Yeah.

50
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:53,540
So you're allergic to heavily salted nuts. So why is your body is saying no, no, no.

51
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:57,620
Yes. Yeah.

52
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:02,070
I try to practice gratitude every day. I like journaling.

53
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:08,730
I work by journaling. Okay, so you practice gratitude every day by journaling.

54
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:16,230
So why do you do that? I think I've been helpful in terms of like just my mental health and like my mental stability,

55
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:21,660
like rationalizing, like the important thing for and like focusing on the positives.

56
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:33,759
So you do it for your mental health. I try to bike to as many places as I can and sort of drive because I think for the

57
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:38,470
environment it's also better for my wallet and for my body to get the exercise.

58
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:51,490
Okay. So you try to bike instead of drive because it's for the environment and for your wallet to save money and for your health.

59
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:58,450
How about one more? Just something like practicing oral hygiene,

60
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:03,009
like brushing your teeth and flossing because keep your teeth nice and not

61
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:06,130
practicing or hygiene has a lot of more systemic effects on their health as well.

62
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:13,420
Okay. So you practice good oral hygiene because, you know it has impacts on the rest of your health.

63
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,830
Good. So today we're going to talk about self-determination theory.

64
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:27,430
Thanks for everyone for sharing your motivations, for engaging in certain health practices.

65
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:38,200
This is actually a very nice variety, so I appreciate it in terms of actually eliciting different types of motivators behind your health practices.

66
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:46,540
So today we want to talk about self-determination theory. This was developed by Richard Bryan and Edward Deasy at the University of Rochester,

67
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:54,100
and we're going to cover some of their central elements, but mostly focus on the main points and how it applies to health.

68
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,650
So self-determination theory as it applies.

69
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:05,350
Now, I wanted to touch on this theory of this class because it really focuses on motivation and leads very well into motivational interviewing,

70
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:09,520
which is one technique that is used to facilitate change.

71
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:16,750
So motivational interviewing itself is not some sort of theory, but it is a method of behavior change.

72
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:23,070
And this self-determination theory really underpins the practice of motivational speaking.

73
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:35,830
So the central question and self-determination theory is what are the essential of new treatments for positive motivation,

74
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:39,400
an experience that enhances performance and well-being?

75
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:46,600
So they're the focus of self-determination theory is really on wellbeing and in many health behaviors,

76
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:54,490
in public health and strong evidence in improving health status, such as physical activity, taking your meds, quitting smoking.

77
00:09:54,970 --> 00:10:03,070
These are intrinsically motivated or they're not typically viewed as fun and enjoyable activities.

78
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:10,840
Self-determination theory posits that if people want to really successfully enact and maintain these types

79
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:17,290
of behaviors outside of treatment settings or really controlled environments like research studies,

80
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:23,230
individuals have to come to value the behaviors and personally endorse their importance.

81
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:31,540
So they want to really know what are the essential elements that have nurtured this motivation to make that happen.

82
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:46,280
So. So what is motivation? It really the definition of motivation is really tapping into the reasons why people do or do not choose to do something.

83
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:51,740
That's what motivation is all about. There's the reasons why we choose to do or do not do something.

84
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:08,180
So in self-determination theory, it's a little more simplistic in terms of some of the other theories we've talked about in class so far,

85
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:17,270
where you just see like so many constructs there and they have each other meanings here, it's a little more dwindled down to three things.

86
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:25,780
So in self-determination theory, they start with a set of tenets and essentially people have three essential psychological needs.

87
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:32,740
That's what self-determination theory really boils down to. They feel they need to feel competent.

88
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:38,969
So we'll go in-depth with self-efficacy next week when we talk about social cognitive theory with the

89
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:47,310
idea of competence in self-determination theory is is really related quite a bit to self efficacy.

90
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:54,000
So do you have like the tools, the skills and the competence necessary to really accomplish a task?

91
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:59,700
And the second way is autonomy. Do I have a choice in what I'm doing?

92
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:07,200
And do I have a feeling of volition or control or power over the action and the choice to do it?

93
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:11,640
Did I decide to do it or is it coming from someone else?

94
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:18,690
That's what I autonomy is all about. And that's different from independence or individualism.

95
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:26,280
So autonomy is not the same thing in this context as independence or individualism,

96
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:31,170
which can be kind of contradictory to relatedness, which is the third tenet.

97
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:39,510
Many cultures sort of operate in a collectivist manner, and autonomy isn't necessarily counter to that.

98
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:47,370
This tenet of self-determination theory has actually been held up in a lot of controlled studies across cultures,

99
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:51,230
whether they're individualistic cultures or collectivist cultures.

100
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:56,399
So autonomy is it's not synonymous with independence or individualism.

101
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,910
It's really, did I have a choice in what I'm doing?

102
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:05,010
I do have a feeling of control or power over the action and the choice to do it.

103
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:09,060
Did I decide to do it or did someone else tell me to do it?

104
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:18,640
That's what autonomy is really all about. A lot of us like to have choices, but some people don't like to have a choice in every situation.

105
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:27,160
Like some. Sometimes we might like having our doctor telling us what to do, but others need to have choice and autonomy.

106
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:37,780
So DC and Ryan describe this as an essential psychological need in the last basic psychological need they describe is related.

107
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:49,180
So people need to feel connected to other people and supported and will impact this more in-depth when we talk about social support later in the term.

108
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:53,890
But relatedness is really about being connected to other people.

109
00:13:55,270 --> 00:14:00,879
So there's no question that our social and physical environment and our political

110
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:05,230
and economic structures can really thwart these basic psychological needs.

111
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:12,580
We see this happen all the time around the world in all kinds of populations and settings.

112
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:16,899
So in thinking about the social ecological approach,

113
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:25,360
our public health interventions really need to consider how these external forces are influencing our motivation or

114
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:33,040
hindering the ability for intrinsic motivation when we are really examining specific behaviors and health issues.

115
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:39,760
So these psychological needs can also be experienced and expressed pretty differently across cultures.

116
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:44,680
So it's really important that our instruments and our interventions recognize and take

117
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:49,540
into account what these constructs mean within the cultures that they're operating.

118
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:56,319
So, so competence, autonomy and relatedness are basic psychological needs.

119
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:03,070
And what they then do is relate this to motivation and self-determination.

120
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:09,879
So some argue that our basic psychological needs are learned from our culture,

121
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:16,450
and the three self-determination theory of needs needs represent more of a Western ideal,

122
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:20,979
and evidence has shows that this actually holds true across cultures.

123
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:27,790
So there have been many, many studies looking at these three essential psychological needs across cultures.

124
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:38,890
So there's pretty good evidence that this is not just is not just like a Western ideal that doesn't fit other populations, other beliefs.

125
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:53,809
So I want to talk about different levels of motivation and self-determination.

126
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:59,120
Theory argues that the strategies we use to really enhance our three basic

127
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,560
psychological needs must also move us towards being intrinsically motivated.

128
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:10,340
So that's the goal of intervention. So when people design interventions using self-determination theory,

129
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:20,140
their main goal is to get people to be intrinsically motivated with the behavior that they're trying to instill in that group that's being intervened.

130
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:31,280
So we must examine our social environment in order to really see how I can facilitate or forestall intrinsic motivation.

131
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:41,890
So do you see it, Ryan? They take a pretty unique approach to motivation and describe a continuum that you saw in your readings.

132
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:51,370
And this is an abbreviated version of the figure from your reading to highlight some of the very distinct areas of the motivation continuum.

133
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:55,540
So I want to pull some of the figure in your reading with a little complicated.

134
00:16:55,540 --> 00:17:04,750
So I just wanted to pull out some of the central areas of the motivation continuum and sort of walk through that with you.

135
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:12,940
So the first consider that people can be cannot be motivated at all, and they call this aid motivation.

136
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:21,070
People who are motivated don't value the behavior of interest, and they have no intention of changing the behavior in question.

137
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:29,560
And in many ways they can be a little bit similar to a pre contemplated or in the trend theoretical model,

138
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:36,640
but not necessarily synonymous with their precognitive plater, but definitely have no interest,

139
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,780
no intention of changing and they don't value the behavior at all.

140
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:51,600
Those folks are motivated. And then then there's this next degree of motivation and they call this extrinsic motivation.

141
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,200
Someone who is extrinsic motivated is in fact motivated.

142
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:03,759
And that motivation can be really high. And if you ask someone to rate their motivation on a scale of 1 to 10,

143
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:12,370
with ten being really high motivation and extrinsic motivation, person may rate themselves perhaps as like a seven or eight.

144
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:18,010
So extrinsic motivated people can be highly motivated on a motivation scale.

145
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:27,549
The key to extrinsic motivation is that it's usually because they are complying with some sort of law or rule or convention or because somebody

146
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:34,870
else told them to engage in a behavior of interest or they feel like they have to because there may be some consequences if they don't.

147
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:41,500
So reflecting on some of the examples that your peers shared, um,

148
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:48,340
was there anything that jumped out that was perhaps sounded like extrinsic motivation?

149
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:10,910
Even those of you who share in you, think about your reasoning for what motivates you around that particular behavior.

150
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:14,870
Does anything to sound like it was extrinsic, mean, motivated?

151
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:20,870
Biking everywhere would be saving money. So that's something you can be more.

152
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:30,749
So. So the motivation to buy due to saving money is extrinsic.

153
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:34,560
We did. The source of that motivation is extrinsic.

154
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:44,250
Yeah. Having an allergy is extremely motivating because you're not choosing you're choosing to do it because otherwise you would get sick.

155
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:59,899
Yeah. So I would agree with that. And one might argue that is that in projected motivation, I would say no.

156
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:07,370
Which is the next thing we're going to talk about because interjected is really more inside your head and you know,

157
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:17,870
eating the actual really salted nuts as was shared that you're right, that is extrinsic motivated.

158
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:24,680
That's not the same as in projected motivation. Yeah.

159
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:29,720
Although they did say that a dentist told them to brush their teeth.

160
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:36,980
How do you make someone see something you need to see? They're like, you want your teeth to look good for other people.

161
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:47,540
It's also extrinsic. So even just knowing, like the health implications of dental hygiene,

162
00:20:47,930 --> 00:21:00,890
that's sort of the health implications that come down from some source that's outside of us, which might prompt us to engage in dental hygiene.

163
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:10,629
So and so again, extrinsic, motivated people may be very, very motivated,

164
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:19,120
but it's really what differentiates extrinsic and intrinsic motivation is really about the source of that motivation.

165
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:25,600
And then there's interjected motivation, and this is our own sort of internal reward or punishment,

166
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:28,930
not something someone else has sort of imposed on you.

167
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:32,470
So this is sort of about your own self-control.

168
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:39,640
You might engage in a behavior because you feel guilty if you don't do it or you feel like it's a character flaw if you don't.

169
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:47,809
And this is not quite as strong as when you combine intrinsic motivation,

170
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:54,530
people who are motivated to demonstrate ability or avoid failure in order to maintain feeling support.

171
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:58,490
This is the locus of control here is still external.

172
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,510
So anyone is brave enough to share.

173
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,150
Can you think of an example for yourself?

174
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:19,550
That might be an example for projecting motivation if you feel guilty about something, if you don't engage in a particular behavior.

175
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:24,320
You see, sometimes over there, you want to be brave enough to share.

176
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:31,100
Well, my friend and I signed up to run a race together, so when I don't train, I feel guilty.

177
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:38,420
Okay, so training for a race feeling when you don't do it, it sparks feelings of guilt.

178
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:43,340
I just feel like with school, I'm not studying or something like that.

179
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:45,530
I feel like I'm like I feel guilty for not doing it.

180
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:50,780
But I think it's just because we're so used to constantly being doing, like, doing work when we don't last.

181
00:22:50,990 --> 00:23:00,649
It's just me. So if you're not, like a student who's doing academic work, 24 seven, you feel guilty.

182
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:08,389
And maybe some of those guilty feelings are coming from an external source like your professors who

183
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:15,590
constantly said you can't produce to remind you to do your assignments and make announcements in class,

184
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:19,040
constantly reminding you to read and keep reading.

185
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:27,800
What you did is still sort of externally motivated those feelings of guilt that we seem to impose on our students.

186
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:33,340
I don't know. One more. Yeah.

187
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:38,469
I'm calling, so I'm trying to get out. So when I drink, pop, I feel guilty.

188
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:43,270
Cause I'm, like, the likes that you're supposed to, like, doing certain things, like boobs.

189
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:52,239
Okay, so when you're trying, you're trying to get out of the habit of drinking, which is the Midwestern term before.

190
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,270
So that's the. I'm not here to learn. I grew up here.

191
00:23:56,510 --> 00:24:00,550
I'm just somebody who may not be familiar. So what?

192
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:06,090
You're trying not to drink? You feel guilty. I drink it.

193
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:10,920
I feel guilty. What do you drink? You feel guilty because it's a character flaw.

194
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:15,590
You've been trying to quit and you sort of take them.

195
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:26,210
So then we have intrinsic motivation. That's where you feel this is very, very important and you really value this behavior in your life.

196
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:30,290
And you'd be much more satisfied if you gauge in this behavior.

197
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:36,620
And they consider intrinsic motivation the most important and strongest degree of motivation

198
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:42,319
that can really enhance long term change in people who are intrinsically motivated,

199
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:50,030
have better performance, and persist with their behavior for longer periods of time compared to people who are externally motivated.

200
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:58,669
So people don't necessarily move across this continuum of prior experience and situational

201
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:04,820
factors determine where someone's motivation stands with their particular behavior.

202
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:12,230
And our interventions must first uncover what that is and sort of in order to really tailor information accordingly.

203
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:19,610
And our intervention activities can also especially tap into and focus on enhancing autonomy,

204
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:27,800
relatedness or competence in order to encourage the behavior to be more intrinsically motivating for that individual.

205
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:33,980
So how do you find out where someone lives on this motivation continuum?

206
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:41,510
Well, you might ask them the following questions. You can say If you didn't engage in behavior X, how would you feel?

207
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:47,659
And here's some clues on what someone might say.

208
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:52,270
So they might say, I don't really care. That's how I feel.

209
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:57,800
If I didn't engage in behavior and feel like you were breaking the rules is extrinsic,

210
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:05,780
guilty and rejected and intrinsic because you just feel really unsatisfied if you didn't engage in that behavior.

211
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:14,300
So this is like a nice diagnostic tool to see really where someone lies with their motivation on this continuum.

212
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:19,160
Now, motivation is also very behavior specific.

213
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:24,379
So, you know, when I think of my grandfather, for example,

214
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:30,980
he's someone who is very intrinsically motivated when it comes to doing his yoga and meditation.

215
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:42,020
He's like 96, doesn't have any health problems where he does his yoga and meditation for like 4 hours every morning, no matter where he is.

216
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:46,340
And he does this because it's important to him and satisfied.

217
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:54,230
So this sort of assessment can be relevant to a whole host of behaviors.

218
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:06,430
So the main idea here is that in the lowest degrees of motivation, people have really low self-efficacy.

219
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:10,690
They have really low autonomy and low relatedness.

220
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,580
And in terms of relatedness,

221
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:21,399
they want to have a lot of people around who really cared about the choices they're making and or really not care similarly about the issue.

222
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,950
According to self-determination theory,

223
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:36,850
they would also like low autonomy and likely possibility of a lack of skill and competence to to make an alternative choice.

224
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:43,300
And on the other end, people who are intrinsically motivated tend to display high levels of autonomy,

225
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:51,460
high levels of competence and skill, and high levels of relatedness as it really relates to the behavior.

226
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:57,910
They feel like they're engaging in their behavior or not engaging in behavior because it is their choice to do it.

227
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:03,730
And they feel a high sense of relatedness because they're around people who feel the same way.

228
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:09,819
So my grandmother also meditates and does yoga with my grandfather for 4 hours each morning,

229
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:16,000
so he feels a high sense of relatedness and community and engaging in that practice.

230
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:24,240
So this is that motivation continuum from your reading.

231
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:31,410
And one thing I want to highlight in this figure is the range of extrinsic motivation that can be evident.

232
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:33,720
It's pretty wide ranging.

233
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:44,520
The types of extrinsic motivation in the red circle are the ones that are really closest to intrinsic motivation, but not quite there.

234
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:49,410
So it's not the same thing as intrinsic motivation, but it's getting us closer.

235
00:28:50,820 --> 00:29:00,390
And identification means that where you sort of consciously value a behavioral goal and the action, it is accepted as personally important.

236
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:05,940
We don't necessarily have to enjoy it or receive an immediate reward.

237
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:09,990
The key here is that they see a benefit to it and it's a means to an end.

238
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,450
So that's how I feel about exercise.

239
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:25,260
So what I think about behaviors in my life, you know, when I think about myself, I think about exercise in terms of identified motivation.

240
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:35,580
I don't necessarily enjoy it or receive any sort of immediate reward, but I know there's benefits to it and it's a means to an end.

241
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:39,520
So that's how I view exercise in my own life.

242
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:46,980
Integrative motivation means that the behavior is more aligned with people's values and their belief system.

243
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:50,430
And they do it because it's right or it's suitable for them.

244
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:57,360
And both identification and integrated motivation are not fully intrinsic motivation,

245
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:04,320
because they're both aligned with achieving separate outcomes that are really different from enjoyment or satisfaction.

246
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:11,530
So when we're at intrinsic motivation, it's all about enjoyment or satisfaction.

247
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:21,729
Any questions about the different sort of levels of motivation or we're thinking about some of

248
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:26,830
the examples that you were thinking about in terms of why you engage in a particular behavior,

249
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:35,650
and perhaps we'd categorize them or, you know, do they follow in a place you didn't quite expect?

250
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:45,959
It's an example that you gave the exercise.

251
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:55,710
Was that external regulation? I would say for me it's identified regulation.

252
00:30:55,710 --> 00:31:02,370
It's somewhat internal. But for me personally, I exercise every day.

253
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:11,400
I don't always enjoy it. I don't do it because it's like, Oh my God, it makes me so happy and satisfied.

254
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:16,850
Sometimes I begrudgingly get out of bed and I exercise because it's a means to an end.

255
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:24,150
That's how I feel about it. So identified and integrated is like, you know, it's, you know, there's a benefit to it.

256
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:27,690
What? You don't enjoy doing it. You don't because you know that it's good.

257
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:29,040
Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

258
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:43,860
Are there things we do in our life that brings us like really personal satisfaction and inherent enjoyment that you can think of for yourself?

259
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:53,290
No, I think I've taken care of my plants, but I don't think that has any health benefits.

260
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:58,840
I think it's just like something I like to do. Okay. So you're intrinsically motivated to keep your plants alive?

261
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:03,280
Yes. Are you happy that like you're just, like, making it like they're doing God.

262
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:09,640
All right. I unfortunately kill all my plants. You never give me a plan, so I appreciate that.

263
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:19,000
Yeah, it being outside. Being outside brings you enjoyment and satisfaction.

264
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:23,950
Yeah. Yeah, I'm cooking at home.

265
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:28,729
Cooking at home. And it's not a means to an end, necessarily.

266
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:39,760
It brings me personal joy and satisfaction. I think lifting weight lifting brings you enjoyment and satisfaction.

267
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:45,970
It does. It's not a means to an end.

268
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:57,540
No, no. Okay. I asked. It's really personal enjoyment with weight lifting right there, you know.

269
00:32:57,610 --> 00:33:09,440
But others. Okay.

270
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:19,160
So how do how do we apply this to health? This is where, you know, when we decided motivation, this is this is like continuum of motivation.

271
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:22,610
So how do we apply this to public health?

272
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:29,880
So this is one model of self-determination theory as it relates to health related behaviors.

273
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:36,229
So notice how we went from self-determination theory applied across a wide range of human

274
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:42,830
behavior beyond health to a model that's focused on applying self-determination theory to help.

275
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:55,760
So in this model, we think about in the middle, we have our three tenets of self-determination, theory, autonomy, competence and relatedness.

276
00:33:56,090 --> 00:34:03,860
And if those three are satisfied, they can lead to better mental health and better physical health according to this model.

277
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:10,020
But then what feeds into the satisfaction of autonomy, competence and relatedness?

278
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:17,680
So the three tenets of self-determination theory, it's really in thinking about this in terms of health care,

279
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:23,990
um, you know, are we getting autonomy, supportive versus really controlled?

280
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:31,270
Sorry. I thought that was the final one for her. Okay, it's not.

281
00:34:32,410 --> 00:34:44,350
You stay here. Okay. So, again, when we think about, you know, satisfying the three sort of tenants self-determination theory, you know,

282
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:49,120
our public health messages or our health communications or even our health care settings,

283
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:56,110
do they support autonomy and the ability for us to make choices that make sense for ourselves?

284
00:34:56,380 --> 00:35:03,910
Or are they very controlling in personality differences, in autonomy also feed into this.

285
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:13,270
So some of us just want to be told what to do sometimes depending on the behavior or the context, and others don't want to be told what to do.

286
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:16,240
They want to make that choice or that decision for themselves.

287
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:28,540
And then intrinsic versus extrinsic life aspirations may also sort of feed into these tendencies of self-determination theory.

288
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:38,650
So really, like, are we sort of walking through our lives doing things because we want to make more money,

289
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:49,570
we want to have higher status in life, or are we doing things because we personally enjoy them and they bring us satisfaction and.

290
00:35:52,030 --> 00:36:02,020
Inherent enjoyment. So this is one model to consider in terms of thinking about self-determination theory and helping people change.

291
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:11,890
So how do we get people to internalize externally motivated behaviors?

292
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:25,740
So these are the conditions under which our three psychological needs are enhanced and really move people towards being more intrinsically motivated.

293
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:30,460
So acknowledgment of feelings, opportunities for self-direction.

294
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:38,260
Having a very secure and relational base of grasping meaning and synthesis.

295
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:41,890
Synthesizing meaning with people's ideas, goals and values.

296
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:47,900
Providing a sense of choice, volition and freedom from external excessive pressure.

297
00:36:48,970 --> 00:36:53,920
Feeling efficacious and also feeling belonging and connectedness.

298
00:36:56,620 --> 00:37:05,800
And the things that don't help us internalize are externally motivated behaviors are tangible rewards

299
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:14,530
that are really contingent on some sort of task performance that really undermines intrinsic motivation.

300
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:24,310
So like free money or some sort of bribes or, you know, if you do this all due to that sort of situation.

301
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:30,700
But other things that also undermine intrinsic motivation are things like threats.

302
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:35,080
And unfortunately, professors are guilty of this for deadlines.

303
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:52,570
You know, we impose deadlines on our students that that really that's not supporting intrinsically motivated behaviors with schoolwork necessarily,

304
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:58,930
but also directives of really pressured evaluations and impose goals.

305
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:02,590
All of those things diminish intrinsic motivation.

306
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:27,130
So Dr. Ken Resnick, who's one of the faculty member in our department, has done a study called Eat for Life and.

307
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:42,610
I posted a slide so you can go through those later if you want to think about different ways of enhancing the different options.

308
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:50,650
So I want to walk you through an example of how self determination has been applied to our public health intervention.

309
00:38:50,680 --> 00:39:00,009
So Ken Resnick, how did a study called For Life where you looked at how we can how we can tailor information to people who have different

310
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:06,430
types of motivation in order to increase their fruit and vegetable intake as part of promoting a healthy diet.

311
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:15,070
And he was working with African American adults and to health maintenance organizations in Atlanta and Detroit.

312
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:21,129
And what he did was he first surveyed individuals to find out where they were at in terms of their motivations.

313
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:31,840
So the baseline and to really in particular understand their motivation with their fruit and vegetable intake through a series of questions.

314
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:39,730
And then he used a computer program to really tailor feedback to individuals based on where they were at with their motivation.

315
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:43,209
So instead of handing people a brochure or a pamphlet,

316
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:49,510
he put this information into a computer algorithm and tailor feedback in the form of three newsletters.

317
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:57,520
And he also looked at autonomy as a moderator, so he wanted to see if different levels of autonomy.

318
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:04,750
So moderators thinking about different levels, some different levels of autonomy that people had with their influence,

319
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:09,550
the tailored intervention on vegetable intake.

320
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:13,330
So some people may want to have a lot of choice in their life,

321
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:21,400
while others may not when it comes to their motivation around fruit and vegetable intake or increasing knowledge.

322
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:28,360
So these are some of the messages that were sent out to people on where they fell in terms of their motivation.

323
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:34,000
And these are just some examples from multiple messages and paragraphs of text.

324
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:41,780
So this is the type of feedback a participant might get based on their motivation.

325
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:49,480
So if Tina had intrinsic motivation, she might get a message that looks something like this and that.

326
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:59,649
I tell it in the italicized brackets, you put in very specific information related to intrinsic motivation that really taps

327
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:05,200
into some specific information they would have provided on their initial survey.

328
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:13,630
So here are what is something you've carefully thought about. Key part of taking responsibility for your own health.

329
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:23,800
But Tina had interjected motivation. She would get a statement like this which would encourage her to eat more fruits and vegetables.

330
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:28,510
And if Tina has interjected motivation, she has her own internal rules.

331
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:31,389
We would want a message that really conveys that,

332
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:42,670
because introverted motivation is really about our own sort of internal ways of operating and doing things.

333
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:51,370
So thinking about feelings of guilt or other sort of feelings that are elicited, we do or do not engage in a particular behavior.

334
00:41:52,690 --> 00:42:01,690
And if you had an extrinsic set of motives around eating fruits and vegetables, we want that message really highlight those external cues or rewards,

335
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:11,170
such as what's conveyed in this statement, for example, proving to other people or showing your family around leading a healthier life.

336
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:18,670
And again, this is very different than intrinsic motivation that a person wanted to do it because it's important to them.

337
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:24,250
Extrinsic motivation is really influenced by something or something outside of the individual.

338
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:31,720
And Dr. Resnick also wanted to look at the influence on that autonomy.

339
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:39,159
So in his initial survey, he also asked participants to rate the statements related to their preference for metonymy in general.

340
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:43,330
When it comes to my health, I'd rather an expert just tell me what I should do.

341
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:47,950
So people sort of rated how they felt about that statement.

342
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:54,460
And his hypothesis was that people who didn't really care about choice that much or didn't

343
00:42:54,460 --> 00:43:00,130
have this sort of desire around autonomy related to their fruit and vegetable intake,

344
00:43:00,430 --> 00:43:07,000
would not really benefit from an intervention with tailored statements related to their sources of motivation.

345
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,239
For people who really value their autonomy and want in choice,

346
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:19,770
this sort of motivational tailoring would actually push them towards changing that fruit and vegetable intake.

347
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:23,430
That makes sense. So if you don't want to be told what to do.

348
00:43:23,790 --> 00:43:28,410
Tailoring on motivation is not going to work. That's what it it costs less.

349
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:36,709
So what do you found here? So you went down this key.

350
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:43,550
The the black bar is higher economies that people want to have a lot of choice and low autonomy

351
00:43:43,550 --> 00:43:49,940
is sort of the the the jagged bar bars there people who just want to be told what to do.

352
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:53,310
They don't they don't need to make that decision for themselves.

353
00:43:53,810 --> 00:43:59,930
What they found here was that people with high on of me really increased their fruit and vegetable

354
00:43:59,930 --> 00:44:05,300
intake when they received messages that were really tailored to their level of motivation.

355
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:11,629
And people with low autonomy didn't really change their fruit and vegetable intake and probably

356
00:44:11,630 --> 00:44:16,760
would have just benefited more from an intervention that just told them what to do here.

357
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:22,160
Eat some fruit and vegetables. That's all that low autonomy group really needed.

358
00:44:23,930 --> 00:44:29,860
And that's just like the control group. They didn't really change, but we saw them in Kyoto.

359
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:33,410
But I mean, they're really increase in terms of their fruit and vegetable content.

360
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:41,239
And he's done the same sort of intervention around colorectal cancer screening with African-American adults

361
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:50,780
and has found similar adult results in terms of tailored messages and preference for autonomy support.

362
00:44:55,370 --> 00:44:57,890
Any questions about self-determination theory?

363
00:45:04,450 --> 00:45:12,580
So like all theories we talk about, I want to show you what they are, but also sort of talk about some of their limitations.

364
00:45:13,090 --> 00:45:19,389
So some of the limitations of self-determination theory, it's sort of you know,

365
00:45:19,390 --> 00:45:26,320
some of the critics say that it sort of assumes that people have this sort of active and growth oriented nature.

366
00:45:27,790 --> 00:45:31,140
And some may argue this doesn't apply to.

367
00:45:32,410 --> 00:45:36,580
In terms of being able to move their levels of motivation.

368
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:42,219
And, you know, compared to some of the other theories we've talked about in this course,

369
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:47,290
some of the theories and models and this one is like really basic.

370
00:45:47,290 --> 00:45:51,970
It just comes down to three things. We have three basic psychological needs.

371
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:54,639
So do we think we have others?

372
00:45:54,640 --> 00:46:06,670
Like, does it really boil down to three things when we think about all behaviors, does it come down to our autonomy or relatedness and our competence?

373
00:46:06,970 --> 00:46:11,530
Like, is that all boils down to for everything we do?

374
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:19,150
So I think like the issue with like simplification is that the complicated issues there just get kind of brushed over.

375
00:46:19,270 --> 00:46:21,909
We have like these brought like generalizing.

376
00:46:21,910 --> 00:46:31,239
It's nice for your beginning, but to actually like at what kind of group of people or to work or to work in the community can be very general.

377
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:40,120
You have to be specific because you're not when you're not specific, you're not able to work as well as when you're able to.

378
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:52,510
So it it's sort of I think what I hear you saying is it's trying to this theory is there's too many general concepts to apply

379
00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:58,900
to very specific problems in very specific populations where we're actually trying to apply this and do specific work.

380
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:16,960
Do we just have three basic psychological needs now, or are there other needs that we might come?

381
00:47:27,670 --> 00:47:34,990
Yeah. Yeah. I feel like it would be nice to have something, like, generally feeling good or just like, feeling.

382
00:47:35,230 --> 00:47:39,250
Yeah, it's like joy or happiness or like the need for it.

383
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:46,510
Just like feeling. Yeah. Good. That isn't necessarily tied to competence, autonomy or relatedness.

384
00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:50,880
Um, but can exist separately. Yeah.

385
00:47:50,890 --> 00:47:53,620
So there's this kind psychology.

386
00:47:53,620 --> 00:48:04,810
Maslow who created Michelangelo's Hierarchy of Needs and that that's sort of addresses what you mentioned about how we might just generally feel,

387
00:48:05,410 --> 00:48:11,080
but also addresses a lot of other needs that people might have that are sort of beyond these three.

388
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:21,850
So in living, I think in the social psychological literatures, there's like different perspectives on what our basic needs really boil down to.

389
00:48:22,270 --> 00:48:29,080
Maslow has more than three and self-determination theory is really boiled down to three.

390
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:33,850
And then there's also the question of do are three basic needs.

391
00:48:34,210 --> 00:48:40,420
If in fact it boils down to self determination and three basic needs, do they change over time?

392
00:48:41,470 --> 00:48:43,299
Like do we do?

393
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:53,290
Are we always wanting to be autonomous or does that sort of change from situation and situation or over time, maybe earlier in our lives?

394
00:48:53,290 --> 00:48:57,309
Do we want to be more autonomous? And later in our lives we want to be told what to do.

395
00:48:57,310 --> 00:49:05,320
So, um, you know, do these three basic needs sort of change over time and in different situations and

396
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:10,920
self-determination theory doesn't necessarily give a lot of direction on how to address them.

397
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:26,500
So one thing I want to do for the rest of our time in class is to look a little more about how different

398
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:32,440
elements of self-determination theory have been applied to intervention activities in our lifetime,

399
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:36,430
as do these types of exercises in terms of applying theory,

400
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:45,820
because that's exactly what you'll be doing as part of your group project applying theory to march on to intervention activities.

401
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:54,969
So some time before you get there with your assignment, but I'm hoping that with more exposure in practice to some real examples,

402
00:49:54,970 --> 00:50:01,960
they'll sort of jog your thinking about how to apply this to the own sort of issue that you're working on in your groups.

403
00:50:02,410 --> 00:50:11,170
So, you know, with some of the folks around you, I'd love for you to look at girls on the move, which is the physical activity intervention.

404
00:50:11,170 --> 00:50:18,760
And I'd love for you to identify the intervention activities that really line up, which is not termination theory constructs.

405
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:25,330
So for example, what activities in this intervention were trying to promote autonomy,

406
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:33,100
what activities we're trying to promote related to this, and what activities were trying to promote competence.

407
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:37,480
And there may be some overlap with some of the activities you made.

408
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:40,719
They may sort of fall into two of those buckets.

409
00:50:40,720 --> 00:51:06,340
But love for you to sort of dissect this intervention as it relates to reconnect with passion schemes.

410
00:51:33,130 --> 00:51:54,740
I guess I just don't think you're going to see some of the same.

411
00:51:57,650 --> 00:52:05,510
Yes. Oh, okay.

412
00:52:06,710 --> 00:52:48,750
Okay. Just thinking about what I do and how the kids are there for the kids.

413
00:52:51,590 --> 00:53:43,030
It's. I mean.

414
00:55:54,020 --> 00:58:19,500
It's. Discuss with your peers.

415
00:58:20,550 --> 00:58:30,250
If you read the article. Okay.

416
00:58:33,770 --> 00:58:39,990
I have some girls.

417
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:45,870
He's probably going to the U.S. I guess I can do that.

418
00:58:46,590 --> 00:58:55,020
I wasn't going to get them out for like for like autopsy capable combatants.

419
00:58:55,020 --> 00:59:04,430
One that I was thinking was like at the beginning, they talked about like don't really care like any arising tissue barriers.

420
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:15,059
So like by talking about how to overcome these various problems because I'm not going to combat pharma if you didn't get 8 minutes or less.

421
00:59:15,060 --> 00:59:21,310
If you talk about the promoting skill I know high school class.

422
00:59:21,550 --> 00:59:28,830
So it can be taken from sort of all of my high school,

423
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:44,690
but there's a lot of busy road going on for like a nursing student are showing them like different options and they need to keep on.

424
00:59:46,110 --> 00:59:49,530
Yeah, you're right. But I think that's more choice.

425
00:59:49,550 --> 00:59:52,620
And I'm more than happy to hear your voice.

426
00:59:52,680 --> 01:00:00,569
But I'm saying, like, and I just, like, never played baseball in that day.

427
01:00:00,570 --> 01:00:06,000
And you, like, did it and you held it out. I would also think they'll be like, Hey, this is an activity that I know I can do.

428
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:22,060
So I could choose to do it, I guess because I mean, I think that was going to need to go like they allowed to share and they wanted to do during.

429
01:00:25,170 --> 01:00:45,750
That's a that's a lot of the times you can just go and do a little bit, but that's not what you're supposed to be doing.

430
01:00:47,100 --> 01:00:58,860
My dad does a lot of different types of girls and there was a session.

431
01:00:58,860 --> 01:01:04,260
There was like a line about like shared agenda settings. Like, I got to know that.

432
01:01:04,790 --> 01:01:17,790
I'm like, Yeah, I like how hard it is for my daughter and the kids.

433
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:34,350
Just this year has been talking about like how much they were trying to acknowledge the changes that the girl had made in 95.

434
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:51,380
So that could also be confused that you made this change and that she really has to figure out how to be like, Yeah, yeah.

435
01:01:52,930 --> 01:02:13,980
I would say I wanted something like that to be one of the ones.

436
01:02:15,390 --> 01:02:28,620
That's true. I know we were just talking about this and basically everything,

437
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:42,270
everything you see and feel and how you said you was like, oh, I was I was really not available.

438
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:50,840
So you're sitting here talking to someone like that related generic?

439
01:02:52,350 --> 01:03:01,990
No, no. Because I live in the modern society in New York City.

440
01:03:02,010 --> 01:03:05,960
And that's how I feel. Like I'm like an animated character.

441
01:03:06,270 --> 01:03:10,580
That's that's more like a real study.

442
01:03:10,590 --> 01:03:23,400
I don't think, you know, people like that because they got to at the beginning like it's like it's like the movie.

443
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:32,780
And yeah, I researched. You search for time.

444
01:03:33,740 --> 01:03:50,330
But I can't. Someone else like I want you to fast on my way to 12% accuracy.

445
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:54,970
And as it turns out, she's not perfect.

446
01:03:55,240 --> 01:04:31,470
And I think that's one of our trainings from like 35, 30 years ago that will make that easier for me all the time.

447
01:04:36,410 --> 01:04:51,090
She says no, quite so exactly what happened to me about what's going to happen.

448
01:04:51,100 --> 01:04:58,100
But I think that's really what I need.

449
01:05:00,590 --> 01:05:07,790
I got a woman and I got out of wanting it all.

450
01:05:07,970 --> 01:05:17,640
I didn't want to tell her that.

451
01:05:18,410 --> 01:05:27,070
I was like, Yeah, I was a little worried there that I really like your class.

452
01:05:31,650 --> 01:05:37,100
I was just I have a time when I was waiting for my phone.

453
01:05:38,030 --> 01:05:44,540
There was like on my street, there was a woman and she was like a trench coat on.

454
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:55,490
I'm like, I don't know what that was.

455
01:05:55,700 --> 01:06:13,579
She was thinking like, if I'm trying to figure out what makes a girl on the move, intervention orders them.

456
01:06:13,580 --> 01:06:18,710
The activities you identified that were addressing homelessness.

457
01:06:20,990 --> 01:06:35,140
And then, of course, she was they were talking about how they're encouraging the girls and they're each capable of developing a related skills, right?

458
01:06:35,150 --> 01:06:45,290
So and so they're increasing their self-efficacy and their confidence around the capability of developing physical activity skills.

459
01:06:46,310 --> 01:06:51,590
Well, yeah, I said in the motivational interviews where they were talking about different

460
01:06:51,590 --> 01:06:55,440
ways that they might be able to pursue barriers or create solutions for that.

461
01:06:56,450 --> 01:07:08,420
So through their mind session, you know, helping them identify their different strengths to increase physical activity and overcome barriers.

462
01:07:14,460 --> 01:07:16,800
Yeah. Offer competence.

463
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:24,980
At the mid-point of the intervention they acknowledged on the iPad program, they acknowledged what changes they had made already since the baseline.

464
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:33,060
Right. So being able to show them their progress. And again, that's a way to increase their self-efficacy.

465
01:07:34,110 --> 01:07:40,530
You talked about how in the club they really focused on promoting skills so that they would if you're better at an activity,

466
01:07:40,530 --> 01:07:47,940
you're more likely to enjoy doing it. And so I'm really trying to help them improve their physical activity skills.

467
01:07:50,490 --> 01:07:54,450
What about our economy? Yeah.

468
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:59,040
I said the nurses want to make the girls feel like the program was a choice,

469
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:06,750
that they were not forced to do it in a way so that it would motivate them like they left, like that they want to do it for themselves.

470
01:08:07,330 --> 01:08:13,649
So there is definitely a level of choice and especially in the conversations with the nurses,

471
01:08:13,650 --> 01:08:21,840
like they share that agenda setting where they they that choice and what we've discussed with them.

472
01:08:25,440 --> 01:08:31,200
Yeah. I've heard messages emphasize that the girls can choose the different forms of physical activity that they wanted to do.

473
01:08:31,770 --> 01:08:36,059
And so they didn't necessarily impose like a specific type of physical activity.

474
01:08:36,060 --> 01:08:40,230
They had choices around what they wanted to engage in.

475
01:08:43,450 --> 01:08:48,520
Yes. They also had input in choosing the activities the club would do.

476
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:53,800
Okay. So they also had choices and information.

477
01:08:54,000 --> 01:09:00,250
It's just a variety that it's a physical activity really does offer general strength.

478
01:09:00,420 --> 01:09:05,510
What about related? Yes.

479
01:09:06,050 --> 01:09:11,210
I said during the after school program with other girls allowed them to not feel singled out.

480
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:16,040
So make them like feel like, you know, in a community sense.

481
01:09:16,170 --> 01:09:20,450
Yeah. There were other people interacting with them.

482
01:09:20,900 --> 01:09:24,890
There was face to face. They got peers actually physically there.

483
01:09:26,390 --> 01:09:32,360
Yeah. Like the part where they addressed, like, adverse interpersonal interactions with example,

484
01:09:32,360 --> 01:09:39,230
occasionally another girl making a comment to someone else, but like addressing that as an attempt to improve something.

485
01:09:39,950 --> 01:09:54,230
Okay. So even just addressing adverse interactions to enhance better relationships among the peers that were exercising.

486
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:59,720
Yes. During the iPad session.

487
01:09:59,730 --> 01:10:07,879
And the models were emphasizing that it was like girls of their age and that it was the next week.

488
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:12,950
When we talk about social cognitive theory, we're going to have a screen to more of what that is.

489
01:10:12,950 --> 01:10:26,120
But the fact that they had the girls on the iPod giving them tailored motivational messages that look like them and seem to be a lot like them,

490
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:43,030
was enhancing feelings of. Any others who identified.

491
01:10:46,140 --> 01:10:54,450
Yeah. So when I was looking at like relatedness, I looked at how they were there, not just like negative comments made by their peers.

492
01:10:54,450 --> 01:11:02,229
And so I thought about like how if you address bullying, like you could potentially improve relationships between kids.

493
01:11:02,230 --> 01:11:05,860
So between the girls. Yeah. So yeah.

494
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:09,650
Addressing. Again.

495
01:11:09,650 --> 01:11:24,200
Adverse interactions, bullying behavior, rude comments was a way to increase the quality of the relationships between the different peers.

496
01:11:26,420 --> 01:11:38,060
So you hit all of the framework. So hopefully this gives you a nice picture of how in an intervention through the different activities you designed,

497
01:11:38,300 --> 01:11:45,930
you can be very intentional in applying some of the constructs of the theory and in this case self-determination theory

498
01:11:45,930 --> 01:11:56,450
in several ways that they were really using those three tenants to increase motivation around physical activity.

499
01:11:59,510 --> 01:12:06,380
So any questions before we then today. Okay.

500
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:14,810
So Wednesday before Friday, you have your first part of your project with the draft.

501
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:18,620
And then I think we're going to be talking about motivational interviewing,

502
01:12:18,950 --> 01:12:28,720
which is a nice piece of work with your self-determination theory and then using it.

503
01:12:28,940 --> 01:12:50,050
What? I think.

504
01:12:52,110 --> 01:12:56,610
I think, you know.

505
01:12:58,730 --> 01:13:03,559
Oh, my God.

506
01:13:03,560 --> 01:13:09,290
I didn't even realize your take. You don't know what you got.

507
01:13:09,290 --> 01:13:14,960
It looks like you it at different times. Yeah.

508
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:20,000
I'm not going to tell you.

509
01:13:20,690 --> 01:13:30,110
I mean, I just wonder what they do with that secret.

510
01:13:35,480 --> 01:13:45,740
So I guess that's just part of the game.

511
01:13:47,330 --> 01:13:51,520
Well, you can buy your paper. Mean.

512
01:13:52,150 --> 01:14:00,979
I told him, I said, yeah, we're going to continue our lecture.

513
01:14:00,980 --> 01:14:02,660
I think you'll see what I mean.

514
01:14:04,330 --> 01:14:21,290
Yeah, I know I'm I'm the same way but is okay because it was hard because I was trying to be, you know, I think I don't know.

515
01:14:21,950 --> 01:14:36,830
I think they might just be you know, another one of is different colors.

516
01:14:37,670 --> 01:14:48,590
And I would say any place that is much off the charts, you know, that's really good.

517
01:14:49,930 --> 01:14:53,870
Okay. So we have like periodic great things.

518
01:14:54,170 --> 01:14:58,340
Extra paragraph explains what I believe in.

519
01:14:58,370 --> 01:15:04,459
And she's like, That's fine. Oh, really? Yeah. So if we do that and then just like, I know my sister, I did.

520
01:15:04,460 --> 01:15:09,920
I mean, I have to to do anything, but I think it's better to have too much because especially if we're going to be writing more,

521
01:15:10,940 --> 01:15:13,129
we'll just I think if we just sit down and just,

522
01:15:13,130 --> 01:15:24,490
like, see guys take like the most important pieces and then put that, yeah, cut it down and submit that and obviously very true.

523
01:15:27,550 --> 01:15:30,920
Right. Yeah. Yeah.

524
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:34,120
No, I, I saw what you did and I was like, good.

525
01:15:34,230 --> 01:15:39,530
We got more than enough. I was like, I'm good, thank you.

526
01:15:39,530 --> 01:15:47,630
Thank you. And I know it's like, all right, I just keep going.

527
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:53,670
Oh. Thank you.

528
01:15:56,020 --> 01:15:57,190
They do that thing where they look at you.

529
01:15:57,430 --> 01:16:03,490
I keep driving thinking like I feel like it was like under maintenance or something, but it wasn't, like, specified.

530
01:16:04,210 --> 01:16:07,450
Like, it just they're just like, not today. Okay.

531
01:16:11,050 --> 01:16:31,960
The next question is what I guess will save her something like literally ultimately 49, 33, 30.

532
01:16:34,980 --> 01:16:42,860
Because. Robert Romero.

533
01:16:46,580 --> 01:16:55,910
Is it, though? What are you doing with my life?

534
01:16:56,280 --> 01:17:17,560
I think the same. I'm not here to search Research Institute for Solutions.

535
01:17:21,330 --> 01:17:25,440
Once generics. One of my worst laughs. Absolutely forever.

536
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:29,830
I can see it starts as terror, which is what they want CROSSFIRE.

537
01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:38,930
I was literally. How?

538
01:17:39,290 --> 01:17:43,560
How is your cat? He's so much better. Yes, he really is.

539
01:17:44,040 --> 01:17:48,630
That was, like, very different. You bounced back a lot.

540
01:17:49,980 --> 01:17:54,490
He just needed to have his moment. I feel like maybe it was a plan. Already.

541
01:17:56,420 --> 01:18:01,180
I am hearing a lot of it. I mean, that's my.

542
01:18:01,700 --> 01:18:13,569
Yeah. This chunk missing my super duper me because, like, naptime, like and after that I'm serious, like, debt to the world.

543
01:18:13,570 --> 01:18:25,210
And he's like, do not bother me. I don't really care if you want to pee before it's going to last and then go to class.

544
01:18:25,780 --> 01:18:35,019
But like guess figure it proud of us for making it on the bus as we like Skype.

545
01:18:35,020 --> 01:18:43,540
Let me know if she starts like over like 45 minutes earlier I it go all right so you.

546
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:48,270
No, not Wednesday. I don't know what it is but as a yeah I'll seriously.
