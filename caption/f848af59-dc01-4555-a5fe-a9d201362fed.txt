1
00:00:05,327 --> 00:00:10,166
Our body uses non-specific and
specific responses in its coordinated

2
00:00:10,166 --> 00:00:13,860
effort against invaders and
other pathogens.

3
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:18,280
This coordinated response is
called the immune response.

4
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:22,940
Our non-specific responses
are called the innate immune system.

5
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:26,050
They're called innate because
they're innately part of us,

6
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:30,990
they do not need anything to be triggered
and always are ready to respond.

7
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:35,490
The innate immune system is always
prepared, it's present at birth and

8
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:37,600
its response is immediate.

9
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,610
However, downfalls of the innate response
is that it offers only short-term

10
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:43,640
protection.

11
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:48,680
The innate immune response includes the
first line of defense against invaders and

12
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,030
pathogens.

13
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:53,270
This first line of defense
are physical and chemical barriers,

14
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:55,860
such as our skin and mucus.

15
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:59,340
The second line of defense
are our inflammatory response,

16
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:05,300
which includes phagocytes to engulf and
destroy bacteria and other invaders.

17
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:09,740
Our specific responses are called
the adaptive immune system.

18
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:14,010
Our body must be primed to utilize
the adaptive immune system.

19
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:18,220
Unlike the innate immune system,
which is always ready to turn on and

20
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:21,630
be activated against any invader or
pathogen,

21
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:27,370
our adaptive immune system must
be primed or taught how to react.

22
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:31,490
The adaptive immune system is
first taught to protect our body

23
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:36,480
through initiating a response by
a first exposure to a given antigen.

24
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,550
Once our body is first
exposed to the antigen,

25
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:44,140
it will not be able to initiate a response
but it will remember that antigen and

26
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:49,710
be able to respond in future interactions
with that pathogen or invader.

27
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:54,490
This type of memory is valuable cuz
it can respond more specifically but

28
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:58,220
also more robustly than
the innate immune system.

29
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,470
The trade-offs of our specific immune or

30
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:05,190
adaptive immune response is that it
must be primed, and so in doing so

31
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:10,100
we get a slower response but
we get a more full response.

32
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:14,120
Thus, the adaptive immune system
is characterized by this level of

33
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:18,670
specificity, it doesn't just respond
to everything it encounters,

34
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:23,220
it only responds to things it has
already been taught to respond to, and

35
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:27,900
it responds to specific
invaders in specific ways.

36
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:32,910
This characteristic of the adaptive immune
system is called immunologic memory.

37
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:35,980
Once it is exposed to a specific pathogen,

38
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:42,945
it knows how to respond to that
pathogen next time and in future times.

39
00:02:42,945 --> 00:02:47,390
There are several different cell types
that are at play with both the innate and

40
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:51,080
specific or adaptive immune responses.

41
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:56,260
Our innate immune system has cells
that can respond by phagocytosis.

42
00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:01,590
Phagocytosis is the process of
engulfing and destroying pathogens.

43
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:06,190
The innate immune system also has cells
that can help signal the adaptive immune

44
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:10,480
system, these cells are called
antigen presenting cells.

45
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,940
So we do see that there is some crosstalk
between the innate immune system and

46
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,510
the adaptive immune system.

47
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:22,420
The adaptive immune system has cells that
work to recognize a specific antigen

48
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:28,880
through either the secretion of antibodies
or other cells which destroy invaders.

49
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:33,680
Our specific immune system has
immunologic memory, these are cells that

50
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,190
work to remember an antigen that
out body was exposed to previously.

51
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:42,280
So our adaptive immune system has several
different cell types which work to

52
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,420
characterize the beauty of that system,

53
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:50,500
cells which identify something as an
invader, cells which destroy that invader,

54
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,500
and then cells which
remember that invader.

55
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:58,280
In this module, we reviewed two
different types of immune responses,

56
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:02,740
our innate immune response and
our adaptive immune response.

57
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:05,190
The innate response is nonspecific and

58
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:11,110
works very quickly in nonspecific
ways against any invader or pathogen.

59
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:16,780
The adaptive immune response is specific,
tailored, and once it's able to respond,

60
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:22,210
incredibly efficient in
response to a given invader.

61
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:25,170
However, keep in mind that in
response to a given invader or

62
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:29,070
pathogen, both of these
systems can be activated but

63
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:33,850
only if the body already has
immunologic memory of that pathogen.

64
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:38,690
If there is no immunologic memory,
only the innate system will respond yet

65
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:42,420
it will signal the adaptive immune
system to remember that pathogen for

66
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:48,240
next time so that both systems can respond
in the future to be more efficient.

67
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,260
This coordinated way is elegant in
its ability to balance the need for

68
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:58,320
efficiency in its response but also
the need for a strong and robust response.

69
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,980
And so our innate and

70
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:04,571
adaptive systems work in coordinated
ways to keep us healthy.
