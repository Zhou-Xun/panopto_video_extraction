1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:15,330
Yeah. So I'm like, you know, just like for, I think for anyone to automatically go back to where I feel like I have to change.

2
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:23,850
I'm like, I know, but I'm not sure if I was really business savvy.

3
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:36,929
Yeah, I don't know. I think it's just crazy.

4
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:40,410
Yeah, whatever. I have somebody I never knew.

5
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:45,160
Her age is, like, eight years.

6
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,590
Cause it's American person. Yeah, I was like.

7
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:52,650
I felt like either I missed it or you did it to find that that was.

8
00:00:53,010 --> 00:01:03,750
That was so lost. Yeah, I think it's a if it's like looking at some guy I know.

9
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:09,270
I was like I thought it was funny how he was, like, trying to plug his cause, but then he never said what the course was.

10
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:25,829
They take that cause. I mean, the person, you know, but she's really taken this experience or a lot because they think,

11
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:43,780
oh, okay, some of us, yeah, we get, you know, we had like we actually didn't have choice.

12
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:48,350
Oh, I guess it was just seven. Oh,

13
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:57,420
we know we had our first assignment and she like was on the list in our we

14
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:13,340
got interested in something that we wanted to put it into for you to help me.

15
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:23,830
And I was like, 0.2 and we're happy to see her like the first two.

16
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:32,129
And then, so then I was like, Are you sure? Like, and you're like, well, like, I have like two people.

17
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:35,340
Like, yeah, one last one. I'm not do not know.

18
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:41,900
And so I didn't like it was like and then someone would be like it's like copy

19
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:50,620
paste everyone just like just like they had no I know we had actually read.

20
00:02:50,880 --> 00:03:15,730
We go over stuff and then we had to be sequestered, see like so here all that and we are like, well, I'm trying to get some.

21
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:37,050
So I didn't even try to find, I didn't see your test result and it was not.

22
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:44,630
Alicia zero. I mean, I was like, oh, good for her.

23
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:54,960
For her, because she used to be my supervisor now switching department, five year old twins and see how she was doing.

24
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,940
And I honestly, I don't remember any.

25
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:18,380
Hi. How you doing? She's.

26
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:56,330
It's. All right.

27
00:04:56,510 --> 00:05:06,710
So you're going to spend most of today workshopping inside the patient and familiar to say the more meaningful.

28
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,670
Before I do that, let's talk about the assignment.

29
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:23,000
And I run through the prostate cancer reports to look at for today and talk through what's going on,

30
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,570
what's bad about them, why are they designed the way they are, etc.?

31
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:30,230
Because those are some examples that we can think of as being as representing perhaps

32
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,700
for practices and good practices that we might want to emulate in your assignment.

33
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:41,540
But let me just start with anything that you have questions you have about the

34
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:47,959
assignment as you're starting to prepare for it along it is what needs to be there,

35
00:05:47,960 --> 00:06:00,290
etc. I've got a couple of things that I want to overview about. Make sure that if you guys have questions, nobody's got questions.

36
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:08,300
Okay, so here are some things for you to think about as you go through this one.

37
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:22,100
As I said on Tuesday, you must have a visual and the table is not a visual related to that.

38
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:31,190
I'll say this in the syllabus, but let me reinforces the visual should incorporate both the test results for this

39
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:37,730
person and the relevant contextualizing information that you think that person needs,

40
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:44,450
not only from the context of the text area, but the graphic needs to represent both.

41
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:57,470
However, this is not a graphic design class, so I am extremely flexible in how this graphic gets made.

42
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:04,970
You are using computer program five. You want to scribble something on a piece of paper and take a picture of it.

43
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:10,760
Five But pay attention to detail.

44
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:19,820
The I couldn't figure out how to make the program do x is not a sufficient justification for not doing something that I wrote all the time.

45
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:28,459
Whatever it is, I would rather get the, you know, just roll it down and take a picture of it kind of approach is what I'm looking for.

46
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:33,440
Here is essentially what you would give the graphic designer as instructions.

47
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,240
So what are the features that need to be in this graphic?

48
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,390
What are the what's the language positioning?

49
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:49,310
All the things that we've been talking about. So make sure the design includes all the critical pieces.

50
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:59,900
Don't get overly sucked into what you're not easy to do in whatever program you're using, etc. are related to that.

51
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:03,080
Under some circumstances.

52
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:14,170
What you're trying to do in the real world is to communicate not just one test result, but how, say, a current test result relays the past data.

53
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:22,100
I explicit instruction. Don't do that. Do not make up additional data.

54
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:26,660
I am giving you one result. Assume this is the first result.

55
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:38,690
Do not try and set this in contrast to past data and set this up in context to information about how this test result might be in general.

56
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:49,070
All of the kinds of contextualizing information that we talk about, but retaining results over time is a different problem.

57
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:53,900
The important problem. It's a really important problem. It's a different problem. So I want to be clear.

58
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:58,560
I am not asking you to do that and please don't try to do that in this life.

59
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:10,310
Other than that, however, you have some leeway. So these tests can be ordered for multiple different kinds of reasons.

60
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:14,030
If you want to make up a specific reason, that's fine.

61
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:26,220
If you want to say, okay, remember part of your purpose here is to remind somebody, what the heck is this test again?

62
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:30,650
So to some degree, you're going to have to give them a reason why this is occurring.

63
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:35,550
That's fine. I'm not saying I'm giving you a single scenario.

64
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:38,740
If you want to make it up, you know, set up a particular context.

65
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:45,680
You're going to see that on the opposite end of the letter.

66
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:52,470
Many of us are in. Education, health, education.

67
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:57,750
There's a natural tendency to want to sort of like, here's all the things you need to know.

68
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,480
Resist that tendency.

69
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:11,160
Think of this as the cover page onto which you might give them a brochure or a set of instructions or ads that are after this letter.

70
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:15,870
But this is the cover page. This is the this is your result.

71
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:22,890
Here is maybe a little bit of instructions based upon what that result is, but not everything.

72
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:30,090
And assume that there is additional information available to this person about the steps that they might need to take.

73
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:35,390
I don't want you to be thinking of this as I have to go learn about that.

74
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:39,270
I have to learn about treatments related to see. No, we're not going there.

75
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:45,800
This is just about the test results. How to keep the task your very bounded.

76
00:10:50,170 --> 00:11:00,670
But the last thing is probably in some sense the most important thing. What we're going to practice today is you thinking about.

77
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:09,790
What is the relevant information that helps you understand whether a result is good or bad?

78
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:18,350
It's not everything. So. What they were going through today is how do you ask yourselves and share at your table,

79
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:24,950
sort of like as you're talking about your different types of test. What do you think is the most important contextual information?

80
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:31,670
What is the thing that experts use to know whether the result is good or bad?

81
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:41,390
We're trying to do is we're trying to essentially embody expert knowledge into the letter.

82
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:49,760
The expert already knows unconsciously. This is the way that I know whether I should feel good or bad about this result.

83
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:55,140
We're trying to take that expert knowledge and embedded within the letter.

84
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:06,650
So it's okay for you to not necessarily have every answer to what we're going to do, but that's the right question to ask is, okay,

85
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:18,980
so when the doctor or the environmental health scientist or the subject matter expert for this C is your value,

86
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:27,740
what are they immediately doing in their mind to translate this into, Oh, that's fine, or Oh, that's borderline or do that.

87
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:30,770
And I think they're doing some process.

88
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:36,410
What are they doing wanting to answer that question? And then I will write that into the letter.

89
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:44,480
The Cleaner your letter is going to be. Any questions on that?

90
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:52,190
Any other stuff that's come up on that?

91
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:58,600
Have fun with us. Like if you want to pretend that you're some lab or that you have some public health role and you know,

92
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:04,190
this is a little fun to go ahead and have fun like this does not need to be a super serious thing.

93
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:09,290
I'm going to be zooming in on the way in which you're presenting the test data, but if you want to have fun with the rest of it.

94
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:15,740
All right. So let's start.

95
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:24,550
With. McCarthy's anthology for.

96
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:34,700
And just so that, you know, I got this from a U of M apologist.

97
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,280
About six months ago. This is what patients get like.

98
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,670
This is not an artificially poor report.

99
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:51,180
This is a they took an actual report and anonymized it and that's what this is.

100
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:57,870
So every reaction you have of this is terrible or you don't understand.

101
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:05,380
This is what patients are seeing on a daily basis. So at 40 years.

102
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:20,059
Let's pick this thing apart. What's the problem with. You can blow up your own tab or I have this idea.

103
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:28,880
I'm not sure I can make it that much bigger. Yeah.

104
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,710
There's a lot of jargon in it. There's tons of jargon in this.

105
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,670
I mean, the very first line.

106
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:41,700
Diagnosis. ADHD, prostate sites. Unspecified biopsies.

107
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:50,990
Prosthetic adenocarcinoma. That answer found.

108
00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:00,640
Yeah. Looks like the headers are helpful.

109
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,590
Like, there's no way to really navigate this.

110
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:10,230
So just to do the overview and I'll zoom this out a little bit, we have this sort of quick diagnosis information,

111
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:14,010
then a comment at the table and we'll spend some time on this table.

112
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:20,550
Then you've got this. Note here about the grading system.

113
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,360
And then you've got this long list of specific details.

114
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:35,390
Etc. Like, as you say, there's stuff here, but it's not organized in the way that certainly a patient would be trying to sequence the information.

115
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:44,550
And if I understand correctly from reading the other part of this, that the score is based on your Gleason score,

116
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:53,640
which is on a scale of 3 to 6, which seems or 1 to 6 maybe, which just seems like a very strange scale.

117
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:58,980
So first of all, let me point out that you're struggling with a critical question here.

118
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:06,940
What is the scale of a Gleason score? A combined Gleason score.

119
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:16,590
Can range from 6 to 10. The fact that you didn't get it instantly noted that is part of the problem here.

120
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:21,300
And by the way, at least the score is not actually the sum of the separate pieces of matter.

121
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:25,350
And so a43 is not the same thing as a34.

122
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:32,580
Yes. And it's not just you add it.

123
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:39,350
The first number has a different meaning than the second number. And I can get into the I cannot do it justice.

124
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:44,510
But that is one of the critical takeaways of trying to interpret this is you can't just add it.

125
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:52,330
But boy, it's not obvious from this. Right. But you're asking the right question.

126
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:55,510
So you're saying this is a unintuitive scale.

127
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:00,070
So the first thing I want to know is what's the range on this scale?

128
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:05,180
And it's not obvious what the answer to that. But that's a problem.

129
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:08,570
What else? Yeah. Yeah.

130
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:16,729
So having worked in health care policy in the past to me and that Medicare claims and other kind of medical claims,

131
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:21,559
this writes to me a lot more like something that from the Michigan medicine perspective,

132
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:25,610
could be used to kind of assess payments because it has a lot of terminology and

133
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:29,360
stuff rather than something that is designed for the patient to understand best.

134
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:41,690
So the question that we need to wrestle with here is you're just if a report needs to exist for a professional audience and insurance audience,

135
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:46,610
a clinical audience, an expert audience and.

136
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,999
The user, the patient, a community member,

137
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,880
etc. also is going to be exposed to it and those two things be the same thing or do they need to be different?

138
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:02,390
We'll come back to that question because it's a really important balance.

139
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,089
But you're right,

140
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:10,940
that part of the reason why some of these details are here the patient would never care about is because they need to be there for other purposes.

141
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:22,060
All right. Yeah. So to keep that question, I think in the past, maybe they could have been the same thing because you receive a call from your doctor.

142
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:30,180
They might explain these test results to you. But now there there's been a change in policy.

143
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:33,850
You receive your test results for free from your doctor. Right.

144
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:39,240
Released to them, like, right away. And so you look at the most important part of this, which is like, do I have cancer?

145
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:43,570
Whatever. And they didn't even take the time to.

146
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:49,090
Translate that into language. I know there's a little important history here.

147
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:59,530
This is a product of the various federal regulations that have been put in place over the last decade to increase access to health care records.

148
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:10,809
And as they're rolled out, it has gone from you can't see the record without a doctor present to you can't see the record,

149
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:17,920
but the doctor will see it first and have a chance to put notes in before it is released to where we are now,

150
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:21,700
which is that it gets released before the doctor can get a chance to look at it.

151
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:31,059
And then he notes that they were put on to it will be put in after patient access is provided so that we are in a situation in which very much.

152
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:35,230
Right. We have to assume that at least some people will see this report.

153
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:39,800
A without an expert present and B before they have talked to the next.

154
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:47,639
So the report. Either creates the confusion that it creates or we need to create a different

155
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:52,800
report knowing that the user's use case is now one in which it must stand alone.

156
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:58,980
But I wanted to bring that history in here because part of the reason why it looks like this

157
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:04,500
is that it hasn't been changed since before the time when patients could have access to it.

158
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:10,110
Right. This was written when the only audience that would see it was another clinician.

159
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:15,380
It was designed with that in mind. All right.

160
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:24,430
What else? Yeah. For me, I worked as a nurse before, so I was, like, kind of training and not trained to read those reports.

161
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:33,850
I have never read a prostate. My result, I usually read that reports at like for blood draw for what I look at it.

162
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:38,190
I would just look at like diagnosis and incompetence and that's it.

163
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:42,370
I won't read like any further on the report.

164
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:46,040
Usually like we like a report like the doctor.

165
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:51,050
Usually the nurses will not be the first one tells the patients like they'll get results.

166
00:20:51,390 --> 00:21:00,310
The doctor is usually the one consults with the patients. So for for us, it's like if what we read under the comments and we do not understand,

167
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,910
there's no red flags and we would not like to talk to the doctor.

168
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:14,570
Right. So the key piece of this is, again, and this is part of the reason why I want to go through this in a single document, multiple audiences.

169
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:24,350
Like this single document is interacting with patients who may be very emotionally concerned about specific aspects of it.

170
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:29,810
Other pathologists who are other experts in the details here,

171
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:37,219
a variety of clinicians ranging from urologists who may know a lot about prostate

172
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:41,060
cancer to a primary care clinician who may or may not know some of the nuances.

173
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:47,900
To nurses who may be the interaction point between the patient and the clinical team.

174
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:54,080
And so the question really comes down to what does a nurse or some other health care professional

175
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:57,800
need to be able to extract from this because they're going to be interacting with the patient.

176
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:06,270
Why am I copying others? Because good design should anticipate every audience.

177
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:13,860
And I want to make the following statement. Some of you are going to challenge me on it, and I want you to challenge me.

178
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:23,610
I'm going to make the following statements. It can be done to create a report that will work okay for every audience if you anticipate that.

179
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:32,100
Just simply designing a patient focused thing does not mean you have to make it unusable or frustrating to the experts.

180
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:38,970
That doesn't necessarily mean that you're going to optimize for it, but you can think about this with different audiences in mind.

181
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:50,050
So one of the questions I want to be thinking about as we look at this and as we look at the other one, is what will the clinician be looking for?

182
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:54,010
What do they need to get at the point that Marc raised about insurance?

183
00:22:54,010 --> 00:23:00,190
Like if you can't get the critical detail information that you would need for, say, an insurance claim.

184
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:08,350
Maybe that report isn't complete enough. But that doesn't mean that that's going to be the first thing.

185
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:12,690
It doesn't necessarily mean that that's going to be the only thing, etc. All right.

186
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:27,970
So let's talk about this table. In theory, what this is trying to communicate is the results of a set of biopsies for.

187
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:33,030
That were done to look to see whether or not you could identify cancer.

188
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:41,980
Even that statement is not at all clear here. And.

189
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:53,540
What this is describing. I mean, so this this column here is talking about percentage carcinoma.

190
00:23:54,480 --> 00:24:01,190
So how much? Essentially what is found. Is that actually the critical question?

191
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:06,590
These are details that the commission might need to know. That may not be something that the patient needs to know.

192
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:11,260
Patients probably focusing primarily on did you find any cancer?

193
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:15,880
And on a much more macro level of how bad is it looking?

194
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:22,760
Which goes back to the end with Andrew's raising of sort of the idea of a Gleason score or

195
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:28,549
something that's going to combine lots of information and give you a sense of how big,

196
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:33,240
how bad, etc. is this cancer? So.

197
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:37,860
I mean, contrast that. With the other report.

198
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:45,760
And let's talk through the details here. What's at the top.

199
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:53,590
Why are we doing this test in the first place? Notice I was talking about that for your own assignment.

200
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:58,090
Like you've got to introduce the results before you just hit somebody with a result.

201
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:04,650
This is. In answer to that question, What is this thing that I am looking at?

202
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:12,390
Why was it done? Then you have a highlighted box here.

203
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:22,330
The captures. From my perspective, actually a pretty good set of the top four things that the patient is probably going to care about.

204
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:27,230
Do I have cancer? Yes. Great.

205
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:31,440
Okay. So that's something I need to pay attention to, but it's obviously something important about how bad is it?

206
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:36,130
The amount. Okay. How much cancer did you find?

207
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:40,630
67% of the samples have cancer. Okay.

208
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:45,970
That's pretty interpretable. And probably even worse, useful risk category.

209
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:49,510
So we spent time talking about labels and the pros and cons of this.

210
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:56,920
This is a use of a label to integrate all this information, to say, okay, so how much risk am I at high risk?

211
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:02,210
In my low risk, no, I'm in intermediate risk. Okay. Does that answer everything?

212
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,690
No. But notice what they then do is they basically break this down.

213
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:09,290
Each of those four points has its own section. What did it show?

214
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,440
You have prostate cancer. How much cancer is there?

215
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:16,250
Okay. He did 12 samples of it was cancer in eight of them.

216
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:21,970
Very concrete. How bad is it? Get plain language.

217
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:27,310
How bad is it? I love that language here.

218
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:32,880
And so you get a little bit of detail about what the heck is this Gleason score.

219
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:42,090
Score is made up of two numbers ranging from 3 to 5. Scale starts at three, policy is six, up to five, plus five is ten.

220
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:49,130
Your score is three plus 40%. Notice their reference.

221
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:55,800
They're basically calibrating you by the end points, then allowing you to see, okay, where do I fall in this range?

222
00:26:57,610 --> 00:27:09,190
What's my overall risk? It acknowledges that this is only one part of the risk, so I hope to suggests intermediate risk,

223
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:13,570
but it also mentions there are other things that might affect your overall risk.

224
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:19,210
So go talk to your doctor. Notice to the instruction it's not okay.

225
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:25,750
You are definitely going to need to have surgery. It's not you are a candidate for this therapy like it's we're too early.

226
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:32,360
Do you have that level of instruction? But it is calibrating somebody to say, okay, so here's where you stand.

227
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:39,830
Go talk to your doctor about this. And this table. And we can argue about whether or not this is the perfect way to represent it.

228
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:47,000
But I appreciate what it's trying to do, like this complicated Gleason score thing that where it matters, whether it's three four versus four three.

229
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:53,780
It's giving you all the possibilities here and told you how they break down.

230
00:27:54,290 --> 00:28:04,049
What's low risk, what's intermediate and what's high. I do not understand the details here, but when I go talk to my doctor,

231
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:11,340
that might prove to be really useful because now I will know that they're going to raise this thing called G stage.

232
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:15,210
And I may not know what that means, but wait a second. I talked to I saw that before.

233
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:24,459
Yeah. I just want to say, when you do that in a communication,

234
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:30,040
it's good to say you may not understand everything in this table, but your doctor might want to reference it.

235
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:37,740
Absolutely. Something like that, too. So they know that they're not supposed to know everything and they don't feel too freaked out about it.

236
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:44,170
And there's a tension here between brevity and that kind of let me walk you through how to do this language.

237
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:48,280
I think that's a great idea, especially for something like this,

238
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:54,910
where they really probably don't need to engage with it at that level of detail if they only take away the intermediate risk category.

239
00:28:56,050 --> 00:29:02,980
We're already in a pretty good place to have that person be talking with their doctor because that's going to give them a calibration for, you know.

240
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:09,370
How aggressive? The recommendations are likely to be in response to it.

241
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:14,240
Yeah. So this is called like a patient centered one.

242
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:20,420
This isn't one that like like a, like a professional audience would use and have all the information they need.

243
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:23,640
Right. Because there is more information in the original report than this.

244
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:36,460
Yes. But. Not as much more as you might think at the beginning, like we have here, the same percentage of samples detail.

245
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:42,940
Now it doesn't go through line by line. And you could imagine, for example, this, by the way, is a good design principle.

246
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:48,490
You could imagine that there was a second page of this that was supplementary tables

247
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:55,120
that had all of the level of detail of what was found in each of the 12 samples.

248
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:59,560
It would be redundant to the basic idea that there were eight out of 12,

249
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:06,220
but it might be that useful from the standpoint of the of treating clinician or of the insurance claim.

250
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,760
Similar kinds of things like that appear in a lot of context.

251
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:19,030
So I'm talking here about designing letters, but especially if you get into the concept of designing interactive web environments,

252
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:27,860
think about what's on page one versus what type of. Like what's on page one would be eight out of 12.

253
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:31,500
What's hyperlinked would be the table that has what happened for each of those samples.

254
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:38,300
Because the patient is perfectly happy getting what they need from the age of 12.

255
00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:42,500
But the expert can quickly get to that level of detail that they might be.

256
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:51,820
So is this perfect? No, but there's a lot of good stuff here.

257
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:57,100
Right. I have one more question on this. The the write down, any questions you might have box?

258
00:30:57,130 --> 00:30:58,180
Yeah, it was really interesting.

259
00:30:58,210 --> 00:31:04,420
Do you know if there's, like evidence that putting that there does help patients be more empowered to talk to their doctor or like,

260
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:09,050
remember, is there anything like supporting that? Yes.

261
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:15,080
I'm trying to figure out how to condense down what I know to respond to this.

262
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:22,310
There's two different things that this.

263
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:31,710
Supports patient involvement. One is it normalizes the idea that asking questions is appropriate.

264
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:37,650
And for many patients interacting with an unfamiliar health care professional,

265
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:44,970
the idea that you could actually ask them something is not necessarily something that they might assume to be true.

266
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:52,139
The fact that you are here means that public health student or medical student,

267
00:31:52,140 --> 00:32:00,270
etc. means that you are already likely more empowered to speak up to a medical professional than the average person is.

268
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:05,770
One of the big things that we see is that patients,

269
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:13,240
the clinicians think that patients are involved and the patients necessarily feel like they are involved because they.

270
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:19,140
They don't know how to be involved. There is a skill set involved with How do I talk to a doctor?

271
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:24,879
So it normalizes the idea that asking questions is a good thing.

272
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:30,250
And there are many patient education interventions that are basically teaching you how to ask questions.

273
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:38,760
But the second thing that this does is. One of the things that we've.

274
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:44,680
Especially when you're introducing new information like a test result or a

275
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:52,480
biopsy result we have to guard against this constantly is to recognize that.

276
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:57,180
To the clinician. This is just information. Patient.

277
00:32:57,570 --> 00:33:03,750
This is a life changing piece of information. They have been shocked.

278
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:13,170
They have just been told they have cancer the first time. They see this will be the first time in their life that they believe they have cancer.

279
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:18,650
They are not going to be in an emotional state of mind and a cognitive state of mind

280
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:23,870
necessarily to remember every last thing that come up in that moment as they're reading it.

281
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:28,210
So saying. Write this down now.

282
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:36,070
You're not going to remember it later. Like, facilitating overcoming that emotional wave is a key piece of this.

283
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:43,180
So there's lots of patient interventions that are basically about enabling somebody to process information at their own pace,

284
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:47,980
have time to come back to it after they've had their initial emotional reaction to it.

285
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,360
To help them.

286
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:58,610
Still have the information they need so that when they're talking to their doctor, maybe it's not that time, but it's the next time they can bring.

287
00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:02,450
Wait a second. Can you talk to me about that Gleason score thing?

288
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:06,950
I don't think I quite understand it yet. And then engage in that conversation.

289
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:13,620
So that's a great point. And there are, in fact, a lot of interventions that are basically about.

290
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:22,200
Enabling patients to believe that it is okay for them to be a partner in the conversation as opposed to just simply a recipient of information.

291
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:35,740
All right. So I want to cover through small things before we go into the workshop for today,

292
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:42,370
which is pulling a couple of things out of the musings that were another example that I thought were interesting to share.

293
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:50,330
First of all, on this one, Sylvia. Tell us a little bit about this.

294
00:34:51,590 --> 00:35:03,140
So the best story of this one is during my senior year of nursing rotation, I was placed in a rural areas community clinic.

295
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:11,120
So the clinic had a lot of low income people and they are they do not have like all pressure machines at home.

296
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:13,280
They do not have a glucometer at home.

297
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:21,140
So they cannot test like if their pressure machine is working or if they are hypertensive, if their blood sugar is being controlled.

298
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:30,680
So I'll be there like once a week to test their for pressure and kind of do like a small console like sections of like,

299
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:36,110
okay, your pressures with the normal range and pressure is slightly higher than normal.

300
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:41,960
Are you taking medication? What medication I currently have. When is the last doctor's appointment that you visit?

301
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:45,799
So I got the feedback of like some of the patient.

302
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:51,710
They get like 125 over like 74 to say you can refer him for it on the table.

303
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:55,219
That's like yellow ish. Yeah.

304
00:35:55,220 --> 00:36:01,640
For us we're just like, oh, is doing normal. You're doing is slightly higher than normal, but you are okay.

305
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:08,510
And the patient's like, what is what is okay? Referring back to our last section, what is what is okay?

306
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:13,880
What does it mean? So my classmate, I kind of get a little light head now for them.

307
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:16,010
So every time that we tell them the number,

308
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:24,470
they can refer back to the table so they know like what number that they should be getting and what they should be concerned kind of thing.

309
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:31,410
Yeah. So this is a nice example of dealing with a difficult problem because blood pressure is two numbers, not one.

310
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:36,500
I see you've got two dimensions to work with and this creates that space that you can see the relationship between the two numbers.

311
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:43,440
This is. A great contextual reference points.

312
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:52,960
If you wanted to make this a number, a way of presenting a test result, the key question becomes how do you place this person?

313
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:58,210
So you need to do something to show like you are here.

314
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:03,670
So if your example was 125 or 75, like that's.

315
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:11,020
This square, and it would need to be absolutely transparently obvious to the patient that they are here.

316
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:13,799
Now we can do that a couple of different ways.

317
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:22,140
And again, this is not a graphic design class, but it just simply providing this graphic and telling somebody your number is 75 over one,

318
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:25,140
24 or 75 does not bring those two pieces together.

319
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,860
You're going to be communicating.

320
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:36,299
Ideally, you want to have both of those things in the same place so that it's up, so that you can visually see, okay, I'm here.

321
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:41,640
I'm only one step away from agreeing on two steps away. It's that kind of visual processing that we're moving towards.

322
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:46,780
All right. So the other example I wanted to talk about was yours.

323
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:53,500
Which is great craft. Yeah.

324
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:57,180
So this is not as public health related, but I've been adjusting.

325
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,520
But you say it's the same problem. Yeah.

326
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:07,320
I've got a GSI for this undergrad class for Three Falls now, and it uses grade craft as a way for submitting and grading assignments.

327
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,740
And it's gamified learning.

328
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:16,680
It's like a totally different way of understanding your grades than on the normal, like a through of scale or like the zero through 100%.

329
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:24,180
So students are coming in from high school expecting that if they get 1200 out of 2400 on an assignment, that's an F and that they've failed.

330
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:30,060
But because of the way the scale is different on this grade crop system, if they get 1200, that's actually pretty good.

331
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:38,370
But what they're seeing is the top one, which is basically like you've got 1200 on this assignment and really based on how the rubric works,

332
00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:43,499
I redesigned it and that's what the bottom one looks like. So really, if they got 1200, that's pretty good.

333
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,899
It's like between nearing and meets expectations.

334
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:51,720
Anything above 1800 on that assignment would be like, you really make it look like you did more than we were expecting.

335
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:55,920
Basically, like students see the 400, they come to office. I was like, I failed.

336
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:04,020
What do I do? And I'm like, You didn't fail like this. So what I love about this story is it's exactly the problem we're wrestling with.

337
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:10,740
There is a set of assumptions that we carry with us that translate that 1220 400 into one thing and it's wrong.

338
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:14,520
And so our problem becomes, how do I give you the context to know that that's wrong?

339
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:20,970
You've done a couple of things here that are great. I'll nitpicked one thing just to give the example.

340
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:27,540
So you've got the categorizations using a color code scheme that's congruent with that.

341
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:29,610
So we've got orange, yellow, green.

342
00:39:29,970 --> 00:39:38,430
I like this extra shift of the wavy line, sort of like anything above here now looks like, Wow, that would be amazing because it's different.

343
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:43,260
It looks visually different than just the top of the scale that you could have imagined

344
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:46,110
this bar going all the way out here and it wouldn't have had the same feeling.

345
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,550
I really notice that now this looks like I'm two thirds of the way there.

346
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:59,330
And then this would be exceptional. You've got the labels visually next to the section.

347
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:03,560
I don't have to look them up someplace else. It's really obvious where I am.

348
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:08,600
The only thing that I complain about here is the rounded edge at the bottom.

349
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:14,450
Zero zero. You can't actually get below zero.

350
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:21,860
So the fact that the arrow is there and then you can go left even a little bit is slightly red, but that's a bit pick.

351
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:26,740
Notice this is a hard edge out here. So that's I don't have a problem over there.

352
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:32,290
And the rounded it here makes sense because you can in fact, go higher.

353
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:38,660
But that type of graphic, I think, accomplishes your goal.

354
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:43,020
I mean, I looked at this and I got exactly what you said from looking at the graphic.

355
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:47,100
So it's a great contextualization of an unfamiliar piece of data.

356
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,090
All right.

357
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:57,940
So what I ask you to do for today, in addition to your musings, was to come with some type of test result that you wanted to workshop today.

358
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:05,980
You can't use the ones for the assignment. So not led, not Nazi forecasts for basically anything else that's quantitative.

359
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:14,290
I'm going to pass out a sort of worksheet style version of the set of questions from the availability worksheet.

360
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:23,020
I want you to quickly take 5 minutes, 10 minutes using computers, fill in as much as you can, easily fill it.

361
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:28,120
If you have to go hunting into the scientific literature for this, you're going to find.

362
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:36,240
You should be able to get some relevant pieces of information here and not others that you will not be able to fill in everything.

363
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:43,020
I want to say that right from the beginning. The goal here is to see what is is the type of contextual information that you can.

364
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:48,660
And then in about 10 minutes, we're going to start having you talk about your test results to each other.

365
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:53,770
Basically I'm studying. You know, I want to communicate. I'm going to make up on here.

366
00:41:55,960 --> 00:42:04,710
Thyroid, stimulating hormone. And I think the most important information to help somebody understand this is X.

367
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:08,380
And I want you to talk through some, like with the people at your table.

368
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:15,210
Why are you choosing this? What do you think is making this the most important information to help somebody understand?

369
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:19,770
Is it categories? Is it the range? Is it the step? Is it what?

370
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:26,400
What is the median value in the population like? What is actually useful to understand the value that you want to communicate?

371
00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:30,450
I'm going to be circulating. Please raise your hand. Call me over.

372
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:34,250
I'm happy to talk this through. Well, the practice is still good.

373
00:42:46,170 --> 00:43:47,070
Over. Well, you know, I guess I don't feel like I am concerned because I that I could read, you know, to him to completely.

374
00:44:08,050 --> 00:44:20,350
The. But.

375
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:46,050
We spoke.

376
00:44:56,580 --> 00:45:00,510
My advice is to take like a really quick first pass through the whole thing.

377
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:04,680
If you can answer any of the questions automatically or even just get close,

378
00:45:07,070 --> 00:45:11,280
then people can go back and ask yourself like, which of these do you most want to know?

379
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:15,780
This is not necessarily in the order that the things that you're going to most want to know.

380
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:35,750
In a stretch. Caroline. Are you. Oh, yeah. This.

381
00:46:42,090 --> 00:47:05,640
We? Yeah.

382
00:47:15,770 --> 00:47:21,290
Oh, that's right.

383
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:36,240
So you've already got the type of interesting question that becomes like, what else do you want to look forward to preventing?

384
00:47:38,090 --> 00:47:50,340
Yes. So I questioned the wisdom of this.

385
00:47:51,170 --> 00:48:02,610
I was the familiar. Because yeah, I think one of the biggest problems and that's the problem with the alcohol testing panel,

386
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:07,720
you have multiple numbers, I mean, like pressures in a simplistic example of this with this opportunity.

387
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:16,170
And so what is it better to instead of doing this one, you just think you could never do this, if that's fine.

388
00:48:16,350 --> 00:48:24,130
Okay. There are different circumstances which would suggest this is true.

389
00:48:25,050 --> 00:48:30,750
But, you know, at this level when I want to be realistic for each of these numbers.

390
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:45,300
But this has come up a couple of different times already. One one test, one result.

391
00:48:45,330 --> 00:48:48,479
You often have things in which multiple things are ordered at the same time,

392
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:53,970
or like with the fact that you've got the percentages and you've got the Gleason score tick once.

393
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:57,670
You don't need to worry about one of these at a given at a time.

394
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:12,170
If you're feeling frustrated like you can't find stuff like noted that move on one of the things you're going

395
00:49:12,170 --> 00:49:16,880
to experiencing for this part of the reason why we're doing this is it's not always easy to find this stuff.

396
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:24,980
And first, what I want you to be thinking about is this is what it's like for the patient.

397
00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:31,999
They aren't necessarily you. They can't necessarily find these contextualizing information.

398
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:36,229
So what is it that we as communicators want to be providing people?

399
00:49:36,230 --> 00:49:39,440
What do you what do you desperately hoping that we find you can get on?

400
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:41,190
That's. I'm going to give you, like, another 5 minutes.

401
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:45,240
Yeah. Don't get all that stuff. That's fine.

402
00:50:48,000 --> 00:51:10,920
Everybody exemptions of what you can know or at least guess how much it can change from you.

403
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:21,660
I think this is where we talk about him as he is that has such a narrow range,

404
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:34,820
just like the challenge of less than half a percentage point of a major change in a half a percentage point of care.

405
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:41,580
Like so. But the way of how do you between if you want somebody to notice.

406
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:45,940
One unit, five units, four units.

407
00:51:46,330 --> 00:52:01,510
Again, it's a judgment call, but it's an important judgment call because it informs you a little world that we were talking about decimals in class.

408
00:52:01,870 --> 00:52:07,300
Like you think about one, just trying to pretend like that was sort of the unit that we were engaging in.

409
00:52:07,690 --> 00:52:12,000
That's the kind of stuff I want you to be asking me.

410
00:53:35,890 --> 00:53:46,880
This moment as a group was taken in order to share what's the test results to try to communicate.

411
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:55,669
And what do you think as far as what you found is the same is most useful or that maybe it's a couple of things,

412
00:53:55,670 --> 00:54:00,440
but like like five things, one or two things, it's like super critical.

413
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:09,980
You got to make sure people understand this in order to make sense of that value and just talk through it, like through your own explanation.

414
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:13,100
And those of you who are listening, feel free to ask questions.

415
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:21,200
Like if somebody says, you know, is this most critical thing is to explain what the range is and so that you come back with,

416
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:26,870
well, are there no thresholds or no categories that maybe that's true, but but have that conversation.

417
00:54:27,620 --> 00:54:35,140
Again, I want us to practice both from the present standpoint and from the receiving standpoint of the question of like, what are you looking for?

418
00:54:35,150 --> 00:54:38,500
What do you want to know to understand this test result?

419
00:54:39,570 --> 00:54:43,940
Just the different for each type of test. That's why I want us to be doing it together.

420
00:54:45,260 --> 00:54:51,639
Okay. And again, I'll be speculating.

421
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:57,250
Please call me anything. Anything, Jackson.

422
00:55:02,410 --> 00:55:10,870
I. I know I can. Tell me about it.

423
00:55:10,930 --> 00:55:28,240
At first, like I was saying, what is it like?

424
00:55:29,380 --> 00:55:35,200
It's kind like I wanted to I don't know.

425
00:55:35,210 --> 00:55:41,680
Like I like to think other people are going to change my life.

426
00:55:42,710 --> 00:55:49,960
So I guess. I guess like what?

427
00:55:58,110 --> 00:56:05,679
No, it's not like that in there.

428
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:23,890
Like, oh, so it's not like or so I was like, I apologize people.

429
00:56:25,110 --> 00:56:38,510
And it's like a club statement that I have absolutely no part in this class.

430
00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:56,750
But at some point because like 43 or I like I was like, you know, I don't think we have any time, you know, I don't think you want to talk about.

431
00:56:56,810 --> 00:57:02,010
So I was like, I was going to stress this.

432
00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:15,850
I mean, there's no such thing as it was like in the current age.

433
00:57:18,020 --> 00:57:32,690
Yeah. Yeah. I don't know why they change anything about what it sounds like like.

434
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:44,480
But yeah, I don't think it is that so many other things like that and I think I think yeah, yeah.

435
00:57:46,810 --> 00:57:54,300
Because like, no one's going to get married. I don't know.

436
00:57:55,360 --> 00:58:06,800
So it's like, well, I think if that's what I think, you know,

437
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:32,800
it's not like the one that I went to school with gets in licensing and like generally I don't know,

438
00:58:34,150 --> 00:58:42,700
it's like I'm saying like I don't like it's like I was like this is a typical

439
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:55,710
like I want to get as high as possible to like more could be broken like this.

440
00:58:56,920 --> 00:59:02,590
It's better than I can do it. Yeah. I don't think they had as much.

441
00:59:05,780 --> 00:59:11,100
That's right. That's right.

442
00:59:14,430 --> 00:59:30,640
Yeah. It's like you're there. They're still in attendance, which is a problem.

443
00:59:33,050 --> 00:59:37,690
Just like I could.

444
00:59:37,690 --> 00:59:47,559
Like, I can't, you know, and they tell you.

445
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:59,950
But, like, I know it's like if it's true or not, if you think it's if I were to stay here.

446
01:00:02,470 --> 01:00:20,340
The second question I would say is an actual. I just felt like it'd be interesting to the party.

447
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:35,470
I was like, Yeah, yeah, that sounds more realistic.

448
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:43,590
You're on the edge that you're actually on the page for it.

449
01:00:44,710 --> 01:00:55,860
But wait, there's more tests.

450
01:00:56,840 --> 01:01:22,010
I know you have to be able to find some basic for us because I'm already like, just like everybody else.

451
01:01:24,060 --> 01:01:30,310
So there's no point in the first place with anybody.

452
01:01:30,340 --> 01:01:56,080
You're just about everything. But I can tell you that, like, I would like to be able to go through it.

453
01:01:57,840 --> 01:02:01,600
I mean, like, I just thought I thought about it.

454
01:02:01,770 --> 01:02:07,920
But I also think about that just three months ago.

455
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:21,190
Oh, I have that. But I know I think it's tough. And I have to tell you, just like, oh, yeah,

456
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:54,030
my pilot and then like this kind of thing and this is an area like 36% like but I'm like, oh, here you go.

457
01:02:54,940 --> 01:03:02,810
I remember doing was like growing up.

458
01:03:07,380 --> 01:03:56,790
And I was like, whatever it was, you know, there were always read this person like everyone else is like for like you got hired as a the judges.

459
01:03:57,550 --> 01:04:44,610
I like exactly one yeah two of the 125 times it's a very aggressive like I don't know I like I like to ask you is there like educated research

460
01:04:44,610 --> 01:05:06,180
that like in the regions 2015 minutes aside talk through what was hard about this task before set about with the worksheet what is it like.

461
01:05:09,030 --> 01:05:22,050
VOICE two Why is this hard? Yeah, it's hard to match them to their cultures.

462
01:05:24,150 --> 01:05:33,210
So I don't always know, like what, what the thresholds for explaining things because I just don't.

463
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:42,030
And there are lots of things out there in which you may know that harm is possible.

464
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:47,670
And no one has ever, in fact, tried to define a threshold for harm.

465
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:53,940
Some of this stuff doesn't exist because it doesn't exist. Especially if we're talking about environmental contaminants.

466
01:05:54,870 --> 01:05:58,649
Like how much? I'll use a specific example.

467
01:05:58,650 --> 01:06:03,330
You're going to be reading about next week. How much exposure to dioxin is that?

468
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:09,090
What do we know? We know that exposure to lots of dioxin is bad and we know how much equals, how much harm.

469
01:06:09,100 --> 01:06:12,690
No, we don't. So you're never gonna be able to answer that question.

470
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:17,990
So that's why we're going to talk about this. What else?

471
01:06:24,660 --> 01:06:32,550
I want to be transparent here. Part of the reason I have to go through this exercise today, because I wanted you to feel the sense of frustration.

472
01:06:34,150 --> 01:06:40,490
I wonder if you have the emotional experience of trying to find the answers to this and realizing it's not easy

473
01:06:40,490 --> 01:06:46,670
to find them and it's not easy to know whether that's because they don't exist or because you can't find them,

474
01:06:47,930 --> 01:06:52,550
because that's also the patient or the community members experience.

475
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:59,960
In many of these contexts. They know they have data that should mean something to them and they don't know what it means.

476
01:07:01,620 --> 01:07:12,030
And part of what I want us to be able to do is to give them something that allows them to get away from that sense of frustration,

477
01:07:12,180 --> 01:07:17,250
to have a sense of meaning from these that doesn't have to be everything, that it shouldn't be everything but the people.

478
01:07:17,420 --> 01:07:20,970
Something. So.

479
01:07:22,310 --> 01:07:26,670
As you're sharing a table. I touched.

480
01:07:26,820 --> 01:07:31,799
I listen to a few of the conversations. Reflect back.

481
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:36,390
What are some of the what I've heard? One of this is to notice that it's different for different things.

482
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:43,180
So that some of you were talking about like, well, in my case, it's you know, there's a categorization scheme.

483
01:07:43,190 --> 01:07:46,410
That's what everybody talks about. And in other cases, a no, no, no.

484
01:07:46,420 --> 01:07:49,749
Here's the threshold. In another case, it's no, no, no, there's no categorization.

485
01:07:49,750 --> 01:07:54,160
But people are paying attention to, you know, how much has it changed, like whenever you were.

486
01:07:54,310 --> 01:07:57,880
I just curious, did you move from that and did we pick up on the fact that you changed?

487
01:07:59,740 --> 01:08:04,540
Yes, each of those is right in those particular context.

488
01:08:05,170 --> 01:08:11,290
And your task as a communicator is to figure out which one is the one that you're dealing with in this moment.

489
01:08:12,610 --> 01:08:18,560
I mean, if the right answer is, you know, you don't actually have to know your number.

490
01:08:18,580 --> 01:08:25,870
What you'd better know is your category. You know, to you, if somebody is example of the blood pressure, that's basically what your graphic was doing.

491
01:08:25,870 --> 01:08:30,250
It's giving you that categorization and that's the thing you're going to take away.

492
01:08:31,090 --> 01:08:34,090
Okay. That might be really appropriate for that context.

493
01:08:35,010 --> 01:08:41,010
In other cases, the category is not enough or it's not nuanced in the right way, etc.

494
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:51,920
So that piece is critical. I saw some of you showing different kinds of graphics.

495
01:08:53,130 --> 01:08:58,140
Because one of the things that you get off of pull up in this Google Age is that you can Google stuff and you'll get lots of other graphics.

496
01:08:59,420 --> 01:09:06,290
Showing these types of test results. Notice when you do that, I'm not going to inhibit you from doing that, but I want to give you a warning.

497
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:11,240
One, notice what those graphics are doing.

498
01:09:12,020 --> 01:09:16,070
Like, are they categorizing? Are they? What's the range of space that are shown?

499
01:09:17,110 --> 01:09:20,590
They're embodying many of the kinds of questions were asked.

500
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:25,180
So notice what's being done commonly in communicating a particular test result.

501
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:33,840
But. I guarantee you that most of the graphics you're going to be able to find.

502
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:40,940
Ah, not as detailed as I want them to be. As you should be leaning toward something to be.

503
01:09:42,580 --> 01:09:48,910
And so let me be explicit. Do not recycle a graphic for your assignment.

504
01:09:50,280 --> 01:10:00,150
They could do one. Make your own and make distinct choices about what the graphic is to represent the kind of context that you want it to be there.

505
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:03,990
Just because everybody else does it one way doesn't mean that you should.

506
01:10:05,090 --> 01:10:08,630
I've seen a lot of bad graphics out there.

507
01:10:09,230 --> 01:10:14,760
So that's my word of warning. It's really easy to get sucked in to say, Oh, I'll just take this graphic somebody else's make.

508
01:10:15,170 --> 01:10:18,560
Be careful. Don't go down that pathway.

509
01:10:23,240 --> 01:10:30,219
The other thing I'll say to sort of. You need this sort of wrap.

510
01:10:30,220 --> 01:10:36,150
All of this up is. Pretend you're.

511
01:10:37,090 --> 01:10:49,080
The patient. You want to ask until we get these results?

512
01:10:51,050 --> 01:11:03,410
That's as good of a measure as anything. One of the universal experiences in the return of results space, whether that's in environmental health,

513
01:11:03,890 --> 01:11:09,440
whether that's in clinical medicine, that that's a research context is.

514
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:18,680
You give somebody a report and then you go to talk to them afterwards and they take the report out.

515
01:11:18,690 --> 01:11:24,480
And I literally I'll tell the story in the abstract and I will tell you the concrete example that's coming to light.

516
01:11:24,690 --> 01:11:29,700
They will literally take the report and hand it back to you and say, tell me what this means.

517
01:11:31,550 --> 01:11:38,750
Because they know they should. It should matter to them and they don't know what it means for next class.

518
01:11:38,750 --> 01:11:42,290
You are going to be reading some stuff about we're going to be moving from talking about.

519
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:52,689
Numbers two, talking about mental models. So this is the quantitative the core quantitative part of the course next one is

520
01:11:52,690 --> 01:11:57,549
about next sort of week or so is about relationships and conceptual connections.

521
01:11:57,550 --> 01:12:00,220
And all of this is related to that type of stuff.

522
01:12:01,370 --> 01:12:09,680
But when I read an article of mine that looks at dioxins, environmental contamination, and I'll tell the story in more detail next class.

523
01:12:11,210 --> 01:12:20,090
But our friends, Bob, who just retired a year or two ago from environmental sciences here in school,

524
01:12:20,090 --> 01:12:28,790
public health is part of this project and earlier projects related to it and literally did a whole bunch of community one on one interviews,

525
01:12:28,790 --> 01:12:34,010
went to people's homes after they had received letters, just like the ones you guys are going to be making.

526
01:12:34,930 --> 01:12:38,649
And the first thing he said to me when he was talking about doing all those interviews,

527
01:12:38,650 --> 01:12:42,880
it was like the universal experience was these people would welcome him into their home,

528
01:12:43,480 --> 01:12:47,320
find their letter and bring it to him almost like on a silver platter.

529
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:51,040
Like, please help me understand what this thing is that you've told me.

530
01:12:54,070 --> 01:12:57,370
So my takeaway message for you as you're thinking about your assignment is.

531
01:12:59,340 --> 01:13:07,040
Do. Let's. Don't overwhelm people with information.

532
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:15,440
Make conscious, intentional choices. What is the most important message you want them to take away?

533
01:13:16,790 --> 01:13:23,120
Make your text, make your graphics. Chip them with that message as cleanly as possible.

534
01:13:23,980 --> 01:13:30,160
This is not you're not going to show me that you learn things in this class by hitting me with every last thing that's on this sheet.

535
01:13:30,730 --> 01:13:34,450
It's going to show me that you learn things by saying,

536
01:13:34,900 --> 01:13:38,970
this is the most important thing I want somebody to be thinking about when they have their test.

537
01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:47,930
This is a test of prioritization, not a volume. And people may make slightly different choices.

538
01:13:47,930 --> 01:13:54,010
But one of the things we're learning today is that it's not actually the case, that there's a lot of ambiguity.

539
01:13:54,020 --> 01:13:59,570
Like usually there's some specific orientation of the way that experts are thinking about a particular type of test result.

540
01:14:01,320 --> 01:14:10,380
There's a threshold or there's a categorization scheme or there is a step that's the important step or something that is really the critical pieces.

541
01:14:10,830 --> 01:14:16,510
Make sure that's in your letter. That's what I'm looking. And obviously.

542
01:14:17,850 --> 01:14:22,500
I'm just giving you a worksheet if you might want to be using the.

543
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:27,580
Tests that you are going to be looking at. Again, not because everything is going to be there.

544
01:14:27,610 --> 01:14:30,610
But because that will remind you of some questions that you want to be asked.

545
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:40,000
So. Any other things we ought to talk about? If a question comes up as you're working on your stuff.

546
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:48,370
Please feel free to email me again. I don't guarantee instantaneous email coverage over the weekend, but I will respond as soon as I see things.

547
01:14:50,660 --> 01:15:09,300
And otherwise, I'll let you go a few minutes early because I usually run a couple of minutes late and I'm just trying to do everything.

548
01:15:15,980 --> 01:15:22,010
Or at least that's what I want to tell you.

549
01:15:22,010 --> 01:15:26,710
You should do it.

550
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:44,690
And I feel like I'm like, oh, I don't know how to.

551
01:15:48,410 --> 01:15:52,129
Like, I don't care what you think.

552
01:15:52,130 --> 01:15:57,830
I have 139.

553
01:15:59,860 --> 01:16:11,210
That's not going to matter. Like something like not what I want to talk about.

554
01:16:12,130 --> 01:16:24,530
I was like, oh, by the way, I'm going to ask you this question.

555
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:30,979
And I was like, We want us to you what?

556
01:16:30,980 --> 01:16:35,540
I'll probably see. And yeah, want a little tricky.

557
01:16:35,770 --> 01:16:40,380
I think I was right there, even though they hadn't. Because I need to know you're fine.

558
01:16:41,270 --> 01:16:45,870
A choice. I will look at it. So I did.

559
01:16:46,250 --> 01:16:55,480
Because you are either going to have to interview them.

560
01:16:57,350 --> 01:17:01,700
I was like, Yeah, yeah.

561
01:17:01,700 --> 01:17:06,860
But that was like, Have you ever noticed that? No, I'm pretty sure.

562
01:17:09,940 --> 01:17:15,000
I said, okay.

563
01:17:19,340 --> 01:17:34,140
So I was to like in the house and I'm like, where is the good spot for no more outlets?

564
01:17:35,870 --> 01:17:42,320
That kind of thing. I will place this down.

565
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:49,220
Yeah. You are going to find like there are a lot of sources for information about this.

566
01:17:49,670 --> 01:17:55,360
And also the 624 that is so easy is assignment.

567
01:17:55,610 --> 01:18:00,829
I feel like I'm doing something like for like a few seconds.

568
01:18:00,830 --> 01:18:09,410
I do think there's something going on here and so you have to figure out what that means ourselves.

569
01:18:09,770 --> 01:18:16,339
Oh, well, so that means even a particular violent scenario.

570
01:18:16,340 --> 01:18:21,980
So any, for example, just came over and asked, is it assuming somebody is diagnosed or not?

571
01:18:22,250 --> 01:18:27,560
My answer to that is, I'm not assuming anything. You can choose to assume something if you wish.

572
01:18:29,420 --> 01:18:41,240
It could be a first diagnosis, could be they're already diagnosed and the tracking steps on that same test, same status, different context.

573
01:18:41,630 --> 01:18:43,610
I don't care about that. I'm driving.

574
01:18:43,820 --> 01:18:49,879
The focus here is on what is the status that is being represented by this test result in the event like sort of like the scale.

575
01:18:49,880 --> 01:18:55,190
Like that's like the articles you've given. Like when there's a level of like seven,

576
01:18:56,150 --> 01:19:00,850
like I have no reference for that whatsoever right now some of the articles will give you reference points for that was.

577
01:19:00,980 --> 01:19:06,590
Yeah, so that's the point here is you should be thinking what is the compare,

578
01:19:06,590 --> 01:19:18,770
what is the contextualizing information that is most useful for a person receiving a household water test result that says this and.

579
01:19:20,220 --> 01:19:25,050
That's not everything that you might need to know. It's certainly not the same problems our water system has.

580
01:19:25,350 --> 01:19:31,290
This is a homeowner, if there ever was. But part of the point of this assignment is.

581
01:19:32,290 --> 01:19:35,860
You need to know what the message is that you think the audience should be taking away.

582
01:19:36,550 --> 01:19:40,930
And I don't want to tell you what that message is. That's part of the interpretation here.

583
01:19:42,690 --> 01:19:48,910
Thinking? Yep. I think that's a question about kind of like the scale.

584
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:56,920
Yeah, like thinking about my graphic and like, some members are complaining like it's just like 50 like country,

585
01:19:56,920 --> 01:20:02,320
but it's kind of like fashionable, like federally. But I feel like it's not like in my research.

586
01:20:02,740 --> 01:20:07,060
Health based, like public health. And it's like when you know, more like corrosion.

587
01:20:07,640 --> 01:20:17,270
So I guess I was thinking like. It might be a little misleading to include it because it's, you know, like so you're asking great questions.

588
01:20:17,330 --> 01:20:24,680
I'm not going to give you clean answers. Okay. But you are noticing a comparison standard.

589
01:20:25,460 --> 01:20:29,570
You are evaluating the relevance of that comparison standard for your audience.

590
01:20:30,440 --> 01:20:34,550
It may be important to provide. It may not be important to provide.

591
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:43,320
Again, the question you need to ask yourself is what do you want this audience to be taking away from the result that they have?

592
01:20:43,950 --> 01:20:46,960
And is that reference point useful?

593
01:20:46,980 --> 01:20:47,940
It may not be complete.

594
01:20:48,540 --> 01:20:55,770
So, again, I'm not I'm not going to dictate one way or another, because there are plenty of things where we give people information that's not enough,

595
01:20:55,780 --> 01:20:59,490
but it's part of the picture, giving them the big picture in terms of what their result is.

596
01:20:59,590 --> 01:21:03,360
I don't think we like unethical. It's like that and to that extent.

597
01:21:04,490 --> 01:21:10,069
If I'm trying to get oh I am paying more attention to that one sit there because part of

598
01:21:10,070 --> 01:21:14,240
the complicating factor here is we have the tension between completeness and simplicity.

599
01:21:15,140 --> 01:21:18,690
So. The choice to include something.

600
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:26,080
Is both an intervention in terms of enabling them to have that piece of information usefully or not.

601
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:34,090
And another thing that somebody has to process. So again, this is why this is a prioritization question like.

602
01:21:35,310 --> 01:21:49,300
Can you? I don't know that I can imagine multiple strategies being applied to each of these two letters that are reasonable.

603
01:21:49,310 --> 01:21:54,700
I might have my own personal preferences in terms of what I think the right thing is, but I can I can imagine multiple reasonable approaches.

604
01:21:55,040 --> 01:22:04,600
Okay. But you're asking the right question when you say, okay, there is this thing, but is this actually helpful for the person?

605
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:08,950
Mm hmm. Okay. So it's not like a matter of like. Yes.

606
01:22:08,950 --> 01:22:13,190
So now it's a standard like how you talk about it, how you say it.

607
01:22:16,070 --> 01:22:19,160
You're not off, but you're sort of stepping away from the core task.

608
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:23,580
The whole point here is you are telling I mean, you're manipulating.

609
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:29,390
You are telling the person you should feel this in the way in which you designed this letter.

610
01:22:30,870 --> 01:22:33,180
My question to you is, what is it you want them to feel?

611
01:22:33,630 --> 01:22:41,970
What is the answer you want them to take away from this and then choose the way in which you're presenting it to accomplish that goal?

612
01:22:42,540 --> 01:22:50,490
This is not neutral. Pick the answer and then justify and support it through the choices you're making in the design.

613
01:22:50,640 --> 01:22:55,980
Okay. Okay. Thank you. Yup. I'm signing a few people.

614
01:22:57,690 --> 01:23:03,840
Sure. I will not necessarily say yes, this is perfect, but I will have quick reactions.

615
01:23:08,170 --> 01:23:11,780
Okay. So. Talk to me.

616
01:23:13,490 --> 01:23:17,150
Okay. So I could use the 0 to 15 scale.

617
01:23:17,450 --> 01:23:23,600
Um, because 15 is like the action level EPA and CDC say.

618
01:23:23,720 --> 01:23:29,080
And how would you know that from the graph? Oh, I guess you wouldn't know.

619
01:23:29,080 --> 01:23:32,080
That is the action level. That's right. Okay.

620
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:40,500
So that's one point. Okay. I also I wanted to show that like anything above 200 is always obviously the safest level.

621
01:23:40,510 --> 01:23:49,389
Anything above zero is unsafe, which is why it started from like, okay, there are several that the color is giving that you might think about.

622
01:23:49,390 --> 01:23:55,060
QUESTION Are there other ways to really reinforce that? Okay. Another question to ask yourself.

623
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:03,380
Think about the comment I made. About the rounded edge and the grounding.

624
01:24:03,670 --> 01:24:09,720
The what? Is it possible to have a negative level here?

625
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:13,050
No. Is it possible to have a level 750? Yeah.

626
01:24:13,080 --> 01:24:17,790
How would you know that? Thinking about two now. Okay. So that's another question.

627
01:24:20,440 --> 01:24:24,850
So are you in the right track? Yes, you are on the right track in a variety of ways.

628
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:28,750
Are there some details that you need to really zoom in on?

629
01:24:28,780 --> 01:24:32,440
Yeah, there's some things that you can do that sharpen the message.

630
01:24:32,470 --> 01:24:35,690
Okay. All right. Thank you.

631
01:24:35,750 --> 01:24:44,719
Yep. I was. Oh, to start nodding off a lot, but most of time before I rushed to the hospital.

632
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:48,230
And then I come here. It's okay. No, it's okay.

633
01:24:48,890 --> 01:24:52,310
Am retaining a lot of it. I promise you, I am.

634
01:24:52,940 --> 01:24:58,040
I'm just imagining coming at 830 in the morning after having done stuff at the hospital.

635
01:24:58,040 --> 01:24:58,109
But. Oh.
