1
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:06,950
Okay. Good afternoon and thanks for coming. Um, just a couple of things.

2
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:16,550
So I'm thirsty. A lawyer is going to come and to talk about 10 minutes about that data capture.

3
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:22,310
And I check that some the websites are still updating the data.

4
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:36,250
So as I said, that is good that we work on some fresh data just being updated because I prepared a lecture for the course last year.

5
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:45,409
So we use some old data, but I think that it would be nice that that we sort of have this data analysis based on the fresh data,

6
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:53,510
the data that just been updated and also that there are a lot of new things happening.

7
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,940
And so so if we can monitor the data this semester,

8
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:12,020
particularly for this new vaccination and and the OMI COVID variants and so we will understand a bit,

9
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:13,490
you know,

10
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:24,020
the better what's going on and maybe we can have some different type of analysis or conclusions that are different from what we learn from last year.

11
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:27,829
And so that's the first thing. Next,

12
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:40,489
as I'm about to set up this sort of Google Excel sheet that can be used to for you guys to set up your

13
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:50,900
group while I check the enrollment is kind of stable 17 people and so we will have about you know.

14
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:56,670
Like six of six groups or so.

15
00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:00,270
I mean, each group would have maximum three people.

16
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:08,309
You can have a group of two people or you can have three people within each group for the maximum.

17
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:08,610
So.

18
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:20,510
So we would do some group projects and yeah, there's some work that probably needs some collaboration and coordination across different individuals.

19
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:28,049
It's a little bit too much for one person to work on a lot of things during this course.

20
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:35,130
So having groups working on something together is cost effective.

21
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,149
My SO and so you can.

22
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:44,490
Meanwhile we can discuss this to a person who you want like to work up a problem.

23
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:48,090
We set up this the beginning of next week.

24
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:52,700
So. So you finally decide if you are going to stay in class or not.

25
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:59,920
So. So that's something I plan to do. So I will continue the lecture.

26
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,120
So as I say, that will work.

27
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:11,030
How this sort of modeled in part, we have a three components to deal with, right?

28
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:22,030
The first is part of this mathematical modeling which basically specify, you know, the the mean dynamics of this infectious disease mechanism.

29
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,770
Then we work out the, you know, the statistical components.

30
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:32,320
And then we will try to understand the interpretations of parameters in the model.

31
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:40,630
So I've been talking about this, and this is a quick reminder that we're going to construct.

32
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:46,710
So basically, this is evolving process from past to future.

33
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:56,350
Of course, that that the past is the the sort of the of the history that you like to collect data from.

34
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,260
And the future is something you want to protect.

35
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:08,040
But what you're trying to achieve here is that you assume that there is underlying system of dynamics.

36
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:12,840
Right? So here in this modeling, we're not looking at just a single variable.

37
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:17,410
We look at of few variables that interplay each other.

38
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:21,729
It forms a system of, you know, equations.

39
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:28,990
Or in this particular case, we're in this in facilities epidemiology that people use ordinary differential

40
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:36,880
equations to model this sort of interplay dynamics across different subpopulations.

41
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:47,230
And this is a sort of mathematical model that we're going to use to describe what is the expected dynamics over time.

42
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:55,210
So this is the part that can be, you know, more complicated or be less complete,

43
00:05:55,420 --> 00:06:06,730
depends on what level of the what the purpose of study or what the level of the data availability, you know, at a given time.

44
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:15,820
So this this is something like could be of lots of both in terms of your objective study.

45
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:23,020
But anyway, we will start with something very simple to understand the actual meaning of the construction of the model.

46
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:29,800
Of course, this is, as I've mentioned repeatedly, that this mathematical model has no stochastic city,

47
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:36,260
so that you can now use the simple statistical method to deal with, you know,

48
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:41,920
statistic estimation, the inference we have to build up another layer of.

49
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:53,270
Off the modeling so that we understand how data are actually generated from this underlying dynamics so that we're basically,

50
00:06:55,100 --> 00:07:05,870
you know, related to the sort of the the stochastic or the statistical model where we will specify some kind of distributions.

51
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:09,430
Okay. So.

52
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:16,990
So. So there are several components in the architecture that we need to, you know, work on.

53
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:21,970
One is the temple sort of evolution from past the future.

54
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:27,909
And then also based on that, you also have the in that is security,

55
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:36,940
inadequate spatial location across different counties if it's in the same state or across different standard across different countries and so on.

56
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:41,950
So for us, at a given time, there are hatreds and attitudes that you need to worry about.

57
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:51,780
It's not only just in the time domain of this architecture will be that we also talk about this sort of in the spatial demand.

58
00:07:51,850 --> 00:08:01,270
How do you use this structure to capture some special interests, inability to understand that this in fact it is dynamics.

59
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:07,380
So this structure is the basic sort of the the structure we we start with but

60
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:15,550
expanded to add more and more sort of details so that this structure can be,

61
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:23,140
you know, realistic or can be useful to handle the data coming from the real surveillance system.

62
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,560
Okay. So this is something we plan to do.

63
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:36,430
And so I talk about this simple example and to motivate the actual model.

64
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:46,809
Okay, this is a time series of daily number of confirmed cases collected from one province is Hubei

65
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:54,520
province in that very early time of the outbreak of the COVID in in China at that time,

66
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:58,870
it is still they are this the time period of our five year.

67
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:01,900
That's a very early time of the outbreak.

68
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:17,740
And you can see that the the this is time axis so and sort of in the late January 2020 there was a outbreak in this province.

69
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:25,900
And then this this number of confirmed cases grew quickly.

70
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:33,400
And then, you know, then there is intervention in place.

71
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:40,110
And so that you can see that this dynamic changes about about ten,

72
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:52,030
ten days after the outbreak of disease, so that this becomes a sort of sort of equilibrium point.

73
00:09:52,450 --> 00:10:02,980
If you do now have a control about this whole sort of dynamics that this this curve would continue to grow in a special rate.

74
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:12,190
However, and this about ten days later, this profit start to fluctuate it, to vibrate up and down.

75
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:19,930
That really means that there is a fight between this natural infection process versus the external intervention.

76
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:25,719
And so that on the one hand, there are some force to push this curve to grow.

77
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,500
And another, on the other hand, there's a force to stop this,

78
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:39,100
to grow so that you can see there's a lot of variation of this pure time because of there's the fight of this two sort of types of forces.

79
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:50,640
And then, you know, if you did this, there were no any external intervention that this one will grow very fast for a certain period of time.

80
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:59,560
So so that you can see that finally this intervention becomes very effective to control the process and make it is to your

81
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:12,160
distinct right so so finally the is stable stabilized and disappeared here this happens in about a 40 days time window.

82
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:18,730
So this is one data of course this there is a reversal of their process somewhere.

83
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:21,730
But anyway, this is what happens.

84
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:30,370
Okay. During the early time of the of the outbreak of this process in this particular province.

85
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:38,530
So they are so so then you ask the question that what's causes the eviction?

86
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:46,299
Is this one so original the virus where this virus is far from right.

87
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:54,160
So so is coming. Whereas where does the virus how this first how did the first case appear?

88
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:59,050
Well, that's it's a very important epidemiology question to ask.

89
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:02,620
What how does how would this get started?

90
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:08,470
And then this is at a very early time understanding that a.

91
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:18,820
Help build two trees. Okay. Build up the trees so that you know of is this is a single channel infection or multiple

92
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:26,770
channel infection early you are more able to control the infection in a more effective way.

93
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:39,040
Right. Does this then then after you get the data, you clear see that the this growth curve goes up very quickly.

94
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:42,690
So immediately you ask what is the error of our zero?

95
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:54,250
What's this? You know, the the infection rate is really a mild infection or this is very aggressive infection.

96
00:12:54,260 --> 00:13:03,310
I think you really need to figure out very quickly and then what will be the effective strategy.

97
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:06,610
Okay. To turn this around.

98
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:15,160
Okay. And so so that there is many questions on this possibly or on this trajectory you like to ask.

99
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:21,850
But, of course, that actually the the story is much more complicated than this one.

100
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:33,489
All right. So because this unfortunate that the this virus was spread worldwide were worldwide different places.

101
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:37,230
Some places have more aggressive control measures.

102
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:45,060
Some places had, you know, mild the country measures and some places had no control measures, whatever.

103
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:48,280
So it becomes a pandemic at the end of the day.

104
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:54,370
But. But for looking at this sort of the trajectories at France have been consistent.

105
00:13:54,700 --> 00:14:01,660
You really need to look at some of the basic issues from this infectious disease epidemiology point of view.

106
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:12,850
Okay. This is something we'd like to see, whether or not our statistical model or statistical analysis of that can help us to figure out something.

107
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:20,890
We cannot figure everything out, but we can figure out something. So this is actually the of the province, COVID.

108
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:25,960
I mentioned that we just drew from this province. But so so.

109
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:36,329
You know, but the actually the place is the the the place that had the, you know, the first reported the virus.

110
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:45,390
But this province is. Elizabeth, this would probably be the place where the first case was reported for anyway.

111
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:51,030
So that's so as I said, that, you know, in this kind of analysis.

112
00:14:52,770 --> 00:15:01,490
So so we have the this kind of trajectory and also we have several questions in our life.

113
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:09,660
Okay. So understanding how the what what what are the causes of this invasion?

114
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:17,300
And we could come up with some strategies how to mitigate or how to prevent future invasion.

115
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:28,590
Okay. Um, so also we'd like to understand the evolution pattern and understand that the rate of contagion and so,

116
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:34,380
so also we like to to say the, you know, the.

117
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:47,120
What are the strategies we, you know, implement so that you can change the momentum of work,

118
00:15:47,300 --> 00:16:00,140
change the pattern of this growth curve so that finally we can plot to this curve because all this data here is this time series is increments, right?

119
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:08,780
So this is number of new cases, but this curve is the cumulative curve, right?

120
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:16,009
So so when you have small increments or no increments, then finally the curve will be flat out.

121
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:26,629
Right, so that this is cumulative curve. So what so what you're trying to figure out here is can you come up with different ways to turn

122
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:35,390
this uncertain point of time so that you can make this curve turn around every time that later?

123
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:41,090
Okay. So so that's something, you know, we like to figure out.

124
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:54,770
So there are some objectives in the are studying disease patterns or trying to build up to models to study infectious disease dynamics.

125
00:16:56,270 --> 00:17:02,000
So object one here is that we want to create a simple interpretive model,

126
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:07,280
particularly that the early outbreak of disease would now have many data points.

127
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:13,999
Usually you have data points like for a week or ten days, you don't have many data points.

128
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,860
If you build a very sophisticated model, you are not able to identify the model.

129
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:29,659
And this is one thing. Another thing is that can you borrow some information from previous similar disease patterns like and then, you know,

130
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:33,229
at that outbreak of the COVID 19 and people will say,

131
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:45,380
what are the similar passages or viruses that been sort of observed or were happened in human history?

132
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:56,090
You know, like source would be that one great source was the one that is the same or similar via coronavirus.

133
00:17:56,420 --> 00:18:02,270
Can we learn from the SARS two to you know,

134
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:11,360
build a some of the prior into the Ebola and so so that's something like you can think about in the very beginning.

135
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,530
You have very limited data,

136
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:25,730
but we do have some experience or historical data from sort of the infectious disease happened in the human history where you may try to,

137
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:37,760
you know, learn from past experience to build out some priors into this model, but simply interpret model would be something useful.

138
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:42,680
And then so immediately the.

139
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:51,590
Well, here is, of course, to stop contending this in fashion where, you know, that is it.

140
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:59,510
So now you can try to, you know, do city brokerage or you do a lot of different ways.

141
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:13,640
But will you, like, have a more complex situation where those strategies or measures are not very effective?

142
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:21,750
Because you always have to balance the, you know, economy, the costs versus the the control of the disease.

143
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:29,350
So. So what are the the better strategies of containing infection?

144
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:36,290
So can we use the model to learn or to evaluate in this case?

145
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:46,010
So a lot of time here, you have to run simulations, large scale simulations to really evaluate and policies.

146
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:57,890
So you don't have a lot you do not a lot of data allow you to evaluate the here it's more like counterfactual.

147
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:03,410
So from our point of view, if I have A versus plan B,

148
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:11,360
how I'm going to evaluate whether or not what's the pros and cons of A versus pros and cons of B?

149
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,480
And maybe you have five plans.

150
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:23,990
Which way is the most effective or most cost effective or or, you know, has the minimum, in fact, that human life and you know and so and so forth.

151
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:32,330
So there are a lot of factors that you like to evaluate so that you can come up with a smart or reasonable decision.

152
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:37,160
So how do you do that? Most of time we will use simulation models.

153
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:38,810
We have to use simulation.

154
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:48,079
Although you don't have data, you have to create some micro simulation model, simulate human behavior, simulated the gross curve,

155
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:56,480
simulate the situation in infection, and put the intervention into the simulation model and see what's going to be right.

156
00:20:56,540 --> 00:21:02,600
So what's going to happen and then how you compare to result and make a suggestion

157
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:10,970
to quite a challenge because we know that even you have a simulation model that.

158
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:18,420
You seem to some extent reflective to reality.

159
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:26,280
And also the prediction it's from simulation model is probably good only for short term prediction.

160
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:30,560
We want to do long term prediction is always very hard.

161
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:33,990
So full of from government point of view.

162
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:37,340
Government won't have a policy to be stable.

163
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:42,390
We want a stable policy. It's government does won't change the policy every week.

164
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:46,950
It's going to be very confusing. So there's a lot of challenges here.

165
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:58,500
But not only to build a model that is going to be able to evaluate several strategies or plans, how we're going to intervene, the disease.

166
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:08,640
But also you can see what government wants to see if we have this policy for three months, right around three weeks, what what would be the result?

167
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:13,080
So that's really something not easy to accomplish.

168
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:19,930
So so that I'll keep this in mind when you trying to pull up this smaller study.

169
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:30,140
It is. In fact, it is. It's your prediction and simulation based approach is very, very popular in this field.

170
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:37,290
We have to do all simulation to do that. So that's why in this course I focus on my CMC.

171
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:45,630
Mark, my colleague is M.S. is a simulation, simulation based statistic inference, right.

172
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:57,990
So that's why naturally we can integrate this power of seeing more of Monte Carlo into this university's this modeling,

173
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:11,100
because in this field as a simulation is very, very essential approach people take to understand the estimation of inference and prediction.

174
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:20,190
And so so that. We need to ask them of the private or the small.

175
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:26,640
And, you know, for this kind of the complex, dynamic system, some parameters are not identifiable.

176
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:34,440
For example, the rate of incubation is you cannot observe that data directly.

177
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:45,689
So, you know, maybe you can use survey data to understand when you have a patient that you can ask when you have your first symptom,

178
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:48,840
where were some some some of the questions.

179
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,280
But it's hard to measure precisely about the incubation period.

180
00:23:53,760 --> 00:24:03,180
So if you want to build up the incubation into the model, the prime herself would be really obviously not identifiable.

181
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:12,800
And you have to rely on some of the sort of survey data with some limited sort of reliability of the value.

182
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:23,430
But anyway, that that's when you have this this kind of complex system, you know, personnel that identifiable.

183
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:27,330
And how do you deal with those not identifiable parameters?

184
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:39,540
You have to really ask yourself what the parameters are estimate for and what parameters are not to be able to estimate from the surveillance data.

185
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:47,630
So and so incorporated into genetic into model.

186
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:57,900
That's of course, very, very important. You know, that older people tend to be more had to have a higher risk of severe symptom.

187
00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:03,360
And that's so so for COVID 19, right.

188
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:12,270
So you you you can the average, in fact, is important from a population sort of point of view.

189
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:27,480
But since the COVID 19 is particularly affecting older people and some subgroups of people with high risk or have some basic some kind of disease.

190
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:36,360
So. So that. Like diabetes or some. That those people tend to have higher rates.

191
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,820
How do you forward them into this model?

192
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:50,430
For example, if you want to assess this vaccination effectiveness, certainly there are tremendous features now that you across different age groups,

193
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:56,760
across different groups with different from a sort of existing disease.

194
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:00,260
Right. So, you know, the.

195
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:06,490
You bring up. The reality in the mall is something we need to do.

196
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:15,070
And on, of course, is, as I said, that this is a very, very challenging thing.

197
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:19,730
In this course I will cover the form prediction.

198
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:26,470
I did not teach that last year, but this year I will teach a predictions.

199
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:35,920
This basically is a kind of a theory or something like to have a statistical

200
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:43,750
guarantee how the of the this prediction set would have the desirable coverage.

201
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:52,600
Okay. So so now all the time in epidemiology or in fact it is only give you a single value prediction say okay,

202
00:26:52,600 --> 00:27:04,360
we are going to have 50 in fact individuals tomorrow but conform conformal prediction said well instead of having a single valid prediction,

203
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:08,020
we will have a set of values in the prediction.

204
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:20,770
Okay. So this 95% confidence or 95 coverage of the of the to predict predict that you're likely to get.

205
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:27,250
Okay so that's something we will forecast some uncertainty quantification the prediction.

206
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:43,950
So that's something that we talk about, as I said, that there are many applications or even in the of mind science sort of research.

207
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:51,210
People only look at a single value estimation. Okay, R0 is 2.5.

208
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:58,350
They never talk about R0 is, you know, between like 2 to 4 or something like that.

209
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:02,930
They do not give you the quantification of uncertainty.

210
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:10,760
I think part of the reason is that they do not have this additional architecture of the uncertainty,

211
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:14,670
like sampling uncertainty in the modeling specification.

212
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:19,890
They only have this mathematical model that has.

213
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:27,850
That's no sort of the stochastic city of as part of the model sophistication.

214
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:33,219
So they're not able to quantify this stochastic uncertainty so that.

215
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:43,090
But where is the statistic right. You know standard error or confidence before epsilon term in our is is the norm right.

216
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:51,670
So we always do that. So that's the error. Statistician can make a lot of contribution to make their results more and more rigorous.

217
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:56,110
Rigorous than just a point estimation of point prediction.

218
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:04,670
So this is also very interesting, Part II.

219
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:16,459
So at the time we started to work on the this kind of model, as I said, I was not trying to buy this kind of efficient this model.

220
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:24,230
The 20 year, 2020 was the first time I started working in this field because I feel that.

221
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:36,840
I was very curious how much has been done by statistician Booth obstetrician in analyzing this surveillance data.

222
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:44,799
And I did not expect that that this sort of COVID 19 would last so long.

223
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:51,490
And at that time I would say, hey, you know, let's see what people have done, like what we can do there to help.

224
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:59,590
But one thing I discovered that was a clear sort of shortcoming in that field is there was no software.

225
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:09,700
Those, like I say, g o con them is that there's no existing software packages that people can use to analyze data.

226
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:16,600
If I download data from CDC, like can I just use our package, python package?

227
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:26,330
I can really browse through that. And I feel that this is a big of a sort of gap in this feud.

228
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:30,020
And then, of course, at that time,

229
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:42,469
you heard that the lot of sort of the a a stories about how researchers run the data and

230
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:49,879
provide that advice to White House so that the person at that time was trying to to say,

231
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:55,040
oh, yeah, they're there. They make a lot of things and based on some kind of statistical analysis.

232
00:30:55,880 --> 00:31:02,480
And I was very curious and even later at the year in the paper may I said that, well,

233
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:08,720
whoever created software for the Presidio becomes a please release your software package so we can

234
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:18,529
compare yours with ours and we can cross validate the place to now just hide their saviors our houses.

235
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:30,799
And we did this and we submit that the result to the White House and I was used to to, you know, to make a, you know, policy for the country.

236
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:34,790
I think that's really a something even now.

237
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:38,209
I don't know why people do not publish their software packages.

238
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:44,630
I really think this is something we should really do our work to make it happen.

239
00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:50,120
I mean, if you think that you have the best software or you think your software,

240
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:59,660
whichever you use to make the result, that will basically lead to some important policy decision for the country.

241
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:03,550
Please release the software. Ours was yours.

242
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:07,720
Maybe ours is better, but we. Okay.

243
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:16,570
We say forget about ours because yours better. I mean, at least we should do more serious the work.

244
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:27,400
And by encouraging people to release the software, I think this is the area that need a lot of effort in the community.

245
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:32,660
Anyway. So let's move on.

246
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:44,950
Talking about mathematical models, that's the essentially the layer that I talk about this, the, you know, the bronze circle here.

247
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,260
That's the something we need to start with.

248
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:53,120
Okay. So so that's the mathematical model.

249
00:32:53,450 --> 00:33:03,379
And this of people who could be invested in the spread cannot be described by a single process,

250
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:17,330
as I said that because essentially there are multiple elements sort of interplay each other and they evolve simultaneously over time,

251
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:22,400
life's multiple process and that inflate each other.

252
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:33,439
So so which process depending on what we want to track and one end track and there are many components you could track.

253
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:47,269
And so, so the very basic model is called our model that was invented like or proposed like about 100 years ago by a UK epidemiologist.

254
00:33:47,270 --> 00:34:02,209
And so so that's the probably the first model everybody born from funding fashion this model so so basically called the multi compare model that

255
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:13,490
are most popular consisting of multiple compartment divided subjects in the population into x exclusive subpopulation according to their status.

256
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:22,040
So basically given time you have 100 individuals, they will be in a different parliament with different subpopulations.

257
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:30,080
Okay. Then of course that the people can move from one subpopulation or a compartment to another at the number of time points.

258
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:36,680
So there's a migration of their sort of status over time.

259
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:42,860
So that's why you need a function or time dependent function,

260
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:51,740
functional time course function to describe these sort of things, the change or movement of those subjects in the population.

261
00:34:52,490 --> 00:35:00,350
So anyway, that's the essential idea and we will start with the three compartment model inside our model.

262
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:10,790
Then we can try to analyze that model and identify what are the limitations so that we can identify some of the extensions from there.

263
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:21,740
So while the big component is the component that in fact it so and the given time, how many people are in the status of being affected?

264
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:30,440
Because this is the group of individual who are able to give the virus to other people.

265
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:33,490
You should. Yeah.

266
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:48,510
An unnecessary, contagious or so being in fact infectious for which contains all the oxygen, in fact, the individual in the population given time.

267
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:52,700
I position that just for simplicity, right?

268
00:35:52,720 --> 00:36:02,920
So when a person is in fact it and the person you'll be able to, you know, give the virus to other and to be contagious, to be infectious.

269
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:13,330
So this is the department that the government tried to track and to put an effort on civilians.

270
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:20,730
So basically this is a sort of the evolution that we're thinking about.

271
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:28,110
So when one is one person contracted the virus and so basically in this sort of

272
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:37,500
incubation period and then so you have this sort of latent infection period,

273
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:46,530
then you have this infectious symptomatic period and then so then you have the quarantine period.

274
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:54,060
So this this is kind of the evolution of this disease.

275
00:36:54,300 --> 00:37:05,150
In the same time, that is also the the situation opacity of of, you know, that that happens in the population.

276
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:18,580
Okay. So anyway, this is now necessarily fully a feed into the COVID 19, but this is something we expect.

277
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:26,400
So you have the passage you sort of floating in the population and people can get to

278
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:31,650
the virus and then they start have the different things and different stage of that.

279
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:39,090
Okay. But in general, that for this pope government owned surveillance system,

280
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:45,690
you may now be able to figure out all the, you know, a detail at this stage of this infection.

281
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:56,380
Whereas the symptom, for example, we know that some people, a certain percentage of people who are infected may have no symptoms at all.

282
00:37:56,420 --> 00:38:03,360
Right. So not necessarily have. In fact, the person is always symptomatic.

283
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:15,050
And and you, the government, ask people to stay isolated due to quarantine or to be celebrities or in fact, some people do not care.

284
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:23,330
Right. So they I mean, the quarantine part is not necessarily fully executed in the population.

285
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:28,360
So there are a lot of things going on, but you can see that there.

286
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:36,060
What I'm trying to see use this using this diagram is that there is a developmental estimate aspect.

287
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:44,969
This this whole thing is not happened. Same time there is a developmental sort of thesis of this.

288
00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:54,150
In fact, it is from being a sizable susceptible and then being incubated and being infected

289
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:59,580
and being symptomatic and being quarantined and being recovered and so on.

290
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:02,970
So there are deferment offices for this,

291
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:13,510
and then you can see that this developmental thesis will be really help us to define the population into different compartments, right?

292
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:19,980
So that different people may have they may be in the different stages of their of this different mental faces.

293
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:23,790
And so that's really the slides I spoke.

294
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:36,830
Okay. So once again, that we tried to build up a system of multiple variables to reflect this sort of process.

295
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:49,700
Okay. And so the so the three important sort of variables we like to track in the surveillance system is who is.

296
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:57,310
State of been susceptible. Right. Well, this is like who are under risk.

297
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:02,310
Okay. So this is the first thing we need to understand.

298
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:08,930
And Narwal, of course, as I said, the probably most important wise who are infected, who are infectious.

299
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,360
Right. So that's so just for simplicity.

300
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:19,779
Okay. Maybe I just exchange infected and infectious here just for the simplicity discussion,

301
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:26,030
but the reality that the person who is contracted virus may now be emailed to be infectious.

302
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:35,700
Okay. And the poor actually recover from the infection and develop antibodies and or died of the disease.

303
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:49,409
And so on, so forth. So so this is some of the of sort of the developmental physicists or some populations that you like to track for the government,

304
00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:56,760
that they won't monitor this kind of sort of situations in the population.

305
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:02,130
So we can get data so we can get a data for each of those situations.

306
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:05,690
Okay. Or not nowadays.

307
00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:12,530
And, you know, we have relatively good coverage of vaccination in the population in the US.

308
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:20,870
So maybe you should ask similar questions for, you know, the subpopulation vaccinated people.

309
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:25,910
So for vaccinated people who are still, you know, have risk.

310
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:37,220
Right. Right. So, you know that that being at risk is not that same level of, you know, before this no vaccination rate.

311
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:49,200
So you may also or. In a state of being susceptible for you being infected, you know, and so on, so forth.

312
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:58,220
You can ask this for a specific subpopulation so that you can tell people what or not they should go take vaccination.

313
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:10,020
So if you have some comparison or some kind of the conclusion that being vaccinated would reduce the risk being affected.

314
00:42:12,490 --> 00:42:18,460
A few more chance of died of the disease were.

315
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:23,900
They would have a milder symptom they have faster recovery.

316
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:29,830
Then people will be convinced to seek a vaccination.

317
00:42:29,970 --> 00:42:36,850
Right. So so you want folks on this particular subpopulation to study the are the sort of

318
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:42,670
compartments and to really make a comparison with the people who do not have it

319
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:48,070
so that you can have some kind of evidence to tell the population that what they

320
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:54,850
should do will have to the government what position you should take to do that?

321
00:42:55,240 --> 00:43:08,560
Well, you say that. Well, we already have clinical trial data, clinical trial data to prove that vaccination it's a good right vaccine works.

322
00:43:09,070 --> 00:43:16,510
But there's a difference between the of the efficacy of vaccine versus effectiveness.

323
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:20,500
So so people all the time confuse the two things.

324
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:32,170
So in COIN trial, you can test the efficacy of vaccine using like 2020 solid if you assess the efficacy of the vaccine.

325
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:37,810
Right. But you try to do this and the population level, you really.

326
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:47,840
Yeah. Protect individual being affected or being.

327
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:53,820
Developing some security seats or title. So.

328
00:43:53,860 --> 00:44:00,729
So. So that's something, of course, the ideal situation we can we won't track every detail.

329
00:44:00,730 --> 00:44:05,889
We won't track every detail of the public, which by you reality, you cannot do that.

330
00:44:05,890 --> 00:44:16,040
Right. What are you can do is really just get some major factors that will major variables your you think they are going to are

331
00:44:17,110 --> 00:44:27,190
basically or essentially reflect this sort of dynamics of the infection and understand that the the situation better.

332
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:37,960
Okay. Well. Oh, if we're not able to really monitor and collect data for every variable we'd like to do.

333
00:44:39,190 --> 00:44:45,410
What are the important variables we like to sort of to?

334
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:54,000
I'll develop the surveillance system to collect data on those variables.

335
00:44:54,230 --> 00:44:58,500
Okay, so this is a simple three compartment mechanistic model.

336
00:44:59,850 --> 00:45:03,560
So susceptible, infectious and removed this.

337
00:45:03,570 --> 00:45:15,960
It's called asylum model. So this is probably the first model, that dynamic model we use in sort of in fashion disease epidemiology.

338
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:22,820
So this mall consists of three apartments.

339
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:28,300
Basically, this three compartments divide the entire population into three subpopulations.

340
00:45:28,990 --> 00:45:38,650
So for a random for a person randomly sample from population, this person either is susceptible for infectious or even recovered.

341
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:47,430
Okay. So I mean, so this three compartments are exclusively dividing the population to three.

342
00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:54,730
So of course that is sense that there's a different mental sort of flavor in this situation.

343
00:45:55,060 --> 00:46:00,340
And I mean, this this three compartment work as a team.

344
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:05,500
Work as a system. A, this system evolves over time.

345
00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:11,439
Right. So then when you think about this sort of evolution of evolution,

346
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:24,040
and then there's always a transition y individual in this this s compartment can move to and the next time the infectious compartments.

347
00:46:24,190 --> 00:46:28,930
So there's a rhythm, you know, a movement from here to here.

348
00:46:29,350 --> 00:46:36,440
And there, of course, that some people, you know, who are in the eye compartment can move to the outer compartment.

349
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:40,750
So over time, the populations shift.

350
00:46:40,870 --> 00:46:45,340
Right. So from one compartment to another. So there's always a rate.

351
00:46:45,850 --> 00:46:49,540
How what's the rate that this transition happens?

352
00:46:49,630 --> 00:46:57,890
Right. So the paper is actually the disease transmission rate that characterize the likelihood of any

353
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:06,830
individual individual in the SE compartment getting infected or a fascist when he or she meets it.

354
00:47:08,390 --> 00:47:14,630
So basically so talking about the rate moving from compartment to apartment.

355
00:47:14,690 --> 00:47:17,900
That's the of the beta parameter.

356
00:47:18,290 --> 00:47:23,960
Okay. This parameter describes the the disease transmission rate.

357
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:33,860
Of course that likewise there is a rate of being recovered from the in fascists to recover from I to r.

358
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:39,380
There's not a transition and the rate of that transition is denoted by gamma,

359
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:47,120
which characterize the likelihood of a I person getting out from the the system.

360
00:47:47,440 --> 00:48:02,000
Okay. So so that's that's the two simple parameters to describe this sort of transition from bidets from s to i gamma is from i to R.

361
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:13,730
And you can imagine that the system is moving and there's just constant the rate of moving from one to yes.

362
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:24,140
Is this just a linear like, ah, could they go back to us in this model or can you come back to that part of assumptions?

363
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:33,470
Yeah. So, so, so yeah. So here I just think that, that this is absorbing, absorbing compartment.

364
00:48:34,070 --> 00:48:38,510
If you are in a recovery that is end. So you save for.

365
00:48:39,110 --> 00:48:42,709
So I would define that I'll have more discussions later.

366
00:48:42,710 --> 00:48:45,830
But this is the first model to propose. Okay.

367
00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:54,530
Oh, so you'll hurt this sort of term basic reproduction number denoted by R zero,

368
00:48:54,530 --> 00:48:59,930
which is actually defined mathematically as the ratio played out over a comma.

369
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:08,540
Okay. Is this transmission really from as to why over the the transmission rate of.

370
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:22,300
So. 2 to 2 are. So basically the everything under this new model is that there's no interventions, right?

371
00:49:22,330 --> 00:49:26,170
So so this is a free system, then?

372
00:49:26,350 --> 00:49:32,050
There's no external intervention. So whatever external force to change this dynamics.

373
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:38,120
Okay. So that. Yeah. So this should be kept in mind.

374
00:49:38,150 --> 00:49:46,060
When you do the model, you basically have a kind of free system with no external force to change the dynamics.

375
00:49:46,630 --> 00:49:56,440
Mm hmm. So this is our models to learn the most basic covariance spreads twinned in the population, and more important,

376
00:49:56,440 --> 00:50:02,139
to assess the factors of various preventive measure measures in quick and dirty fashion,

377
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:07,570
such as social distancing and future spread disease pattern in the US.

378
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:16,479
So so this model is typically used in the early stage of the, the, you know, the varsity,

379
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:22,660
this outbreak where you haven't really had any ideas how to intervene this process.

380
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:29,160
Yeah. So you collecting data, trying to understand what is the, you know, basic reproduction number.

381
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:38,470
So what is what? Basically, this is a sort of important number for people to understand the severity of this infectious disease.

382
00:50:39,070 --> 00:50:40,240
And typically,

383
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:51,700
this simple model is used in the very early stage of this disease where you don't have much data available for you to do this modeling and.

384
00:50:55,830 --> 00:51:00,450
They made an impression of it easily and we can talk around it.

385
00:51:00,570 --> 00:51:11,970
It is really different in that I hold on, let me just do this when everyone else is going to be talking about it.

386
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:19,260
Well. In particular, one person getting fired.

387
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:22,520
How many people is that the definition? That's right. That's right. So.

388
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:28,320
So interpretation. I would talk about interpolation. Our zero is basically on average.

389
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:32,430
Right. Why, in fact, infectious person.

390
00:51:32,580 --> 00:51:39,320
How many people can be affected effective by a single infectious person?

391
00:51:39,330 --> 00:51:43,500
That's basically what the R0 means. I will come up with that interpretation.

392
00:51:45,090 --> 00:51:56,820
Okay. So. So look out that the the just a simple sort of simulated data to understand this three compartments, right?

393
00:51:57,210 --> 00:52:06,090
So let's say you have 100 days and then you have 100 individuals in the population.

394
00:52:06,090 --> 00:52:12,870
So at a time zero. You have one hungry individual in the population who are all susceptible.

395
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:16,900
Right. So now when when this process moves.

396
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:21,690
So so this as I said, that is a function of time, of days, for example.

397
00:52:22,230 --> 00:52:25,320
So. So so when you move from 0 to 1.

398
00:52:27,270 --> 00:52:37,770
So this number of susceptible individuals drop or the subpopulation of susceptible subjects are, you know,

399
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:45,240
reduce because more and more people are moving from susceptible to infections and to a recovery.

400
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:54,930
So you can see that this this first compartment is decreasing over time and they've recovered from

401
00:52:54,980 --> 00:53:03,540
compartments recover compartment increase because more and more people recover right from zero to,

402
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:19,470
you know, sort of in point of 100. And here for the infections here is basically the you you would have this kind of the sort of it's

403
00:53:19,590 --> 00:53:29,280
not monotonic but is this shape where this number of the infected individuals will enter over time.

404
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:34,830
And so first you have nobody infected but increased and then decrease.

405
00:53:35,210 --> 00:53:44,480
Okay. So that when this becomes zero, then the this facet is stops, right?

406
00:53:44,490 --> 00:53:55,020
So so can you imagine that if you have this increase the number of infections and then going down and then this suppose that,

407
00:53:55,020 --> 00:54:02,670
you know, people are able to to recover and either to recover the date of this.

408
00:54:02,850 --> 00:54:14,420
Okay. So so you can say that this given time that this three numbers should add up to the total population, for example, at the 20.

409
00:54:14,450 --> 00:54:20,729
So you have the high here, the number of recovered cases and you have number,

410
00:54:20,730 --> 00:54:26,850
in fact, the cases and you have number of people in the susceptible cases.

411
00:54:27,210 --> 00:54:31,100
So this is always constant, okay.

412
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:38,820
Because at a time the population is divided by this three numbers, but of course this three numbers are functions of time.

413
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:43,890
They change over time. So so the first one is decreasing.

414
00:54:44,070 --> 00:54:49,080
This third one is increasing and the one in the middle is going up and down.

415
00:54:50,670 --> 00:55:02,120
So in this simulation study particularly, I used to scale from 0 to 100 for the reason that later on will mention you can think of all the 0 to 100.

416
00:55:02,130 --> 00:55:06,600
It could be a percentage, but in the absolute number of individuals.

417
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:15,450
So some epidemiologist advocate that you should use percentage rather than absolute number of the infection.

418
00:55:15,450 --> 00:55:24,600
So so here you can imagine you can you can sort of regard this scale on the Y axis as percentage rather than number of individuals.

419
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:25,169
Of course,

420
00:55:25,170 --> 00:55:35,010
the data was originally simulated by number the integer that a number of this but when you interpret this you can interpret as a certain percentage.

421
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:39,340
So that's. Yep.

422
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:45,760
So is it common to assume? Population like no births or.

423
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:57,200
No, no, no. There's this basically the assumption that when you have very short term time out, it's actually not like COVID 19 because people migrate.

424
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:07,310
A lot of people move out from city to suburb areas and even people, you know, go with one person or so so forth, like COVID 19.

425
00:56:07,550 --> 00:56:12,500
There are a lot of migration. You know, people leave one region to another.

426
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:17,430
So so yeah, the constant population size is a problem.

427
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:27,559
But, you know, this is a mathematical model. We start with something very simple to understand how we can model this process.

428
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:32,320
Then we're trying to see how we're going to modify it to be more realistic.

429
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:43,130
All right. So so here we work home most of the the sort of the cumulative thing.

430
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:53,890
So you can imagine that you can interpret that kind of curve as this kind of sort of container of water.

431
00:56:53,900 --> 00:57:05,180
Right. So. So. So you start from here to here. And the divide of speed of water is really that the flow from one compartment to another.

432
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:11,080
So that tells you I mean, if you have experience of, you know, you.

433
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:20,190
I'll do the tap in the kitchen. You'll know that this this flow rate is somewhat reflective.

434
00:57:20,190 --> 00:57:27,960
There are a bead on the column. Okay. So anyway, so this is a system that we are going to model over time.

435
00:57:30,110 --> 00:57:35,630
So differential equations and dynamics.

436
00:57:35,750 --> 00:57:39,230
So it's so.

437
00:57:41,670 --> 00:57:50,799
So here we work on the. Because essentially your divide is population.

438
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:56,650
Use those three subpopulations. You're not looking at increments perceive.

439
00:57:56,800 --> 00:58:00,850
You're looking at the you're not the size of sub population.

440
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:07,390
So sometimes that you can this in fascist or in fact that I'm the example of trying to

441
00:58:07,690 --> 00:58:14,230
you know you change this to terms but sometimes you can think about this as kind of.

442
00:58:18,110 --> 00:58:25,210
Oh, we do now. I mean, in the mall, we do not mall the incidents, but you can work on the incidents as the improvements.

443
00:58:25,220 --> 00:58:35,630
But, you know, we since the mall itself itself is set up as solid in size and population is you can think about this kind of problems at that time.

444
00:58:37,310 --> 00:58:44,510
And the removal compartment could be either recover from disease or deaths.

445
00:58:44,690 --> 00:58:53,720
Right. So so this is a compartment that can be folded is divided into two compartment.

446
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:59,660
Why is the compartment of Das? Another is compartment of recovery.

447
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:12,600
So. So but from the the original bone architecture where the only three compartments are considered.

448
00:59:12,610 --> 00:59:21,500
So in this case we just combine is two compartments addressed and recovered together into one compartment recovered.

449
00:59:22,340 --> 00:59:31,730
But we do have a data of like, you know, helped, you know, do the top mentality data and some recovered data.

450
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:35,330
Okay. So, so, so maybe you can leave this.

451
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:48,790
For the simplicity. Let's just take it as simple and sort of combine stats and recover as one subpopulation removed from the system.

452
00:59:51,120 --> 01:00:03,599
If they say they are the September 2nd, each pocket represents their one part of the fascistic state bodies.

453
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:09,590
V the water moving from one part buckets to another defined dynamics we like to model.

454
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:18,210
So anyway, the modeling of dynamics is needed in order to protect the interaction mechanism.

455
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:25,130
And someone else for me thinks. Okay.

456
01:00:25,140 --> 01:00:28,200
Here is the the actually the the back end.

457
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:41,420
Okay. So let's understand how the mall was set up so that we can extended it in future as needed.

458
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:53,130
So we basic consider a very small time interval or instant instantaneous time unit denoted by Delta T.

459
01:00:53,970 --> 01:01:00,990
So consider very I mean this argument has been using survival analysis to argue they are the function of Heather.

460
01:01:01,020 --> 01:01:05,560
Right so so so think about the very very time time interval.

461
01:01:06,510 --> 01:01:13,499
So then at that time look at that. These cumulative were number of these in fact subjects and time.

462
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:21,150
T Okay. And basically this is the size of subpopulation population of being the factor.

463
01:01:22,140 --> 01:01:29,940
Likewise, we have s t this is to me the number of or the number of the susceptible subjects of time t and time.

464
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:33,880
And we. Although at that time.

465
01:01:34,060 --> 01:01:37,630
Okay. So now we're looking at a chance. Okay.

466
01:01:38,380 --> 01:01:41,530
From time to time, t plus delta t.

467
01:01:41,710 --> 01:01:45,970
So we move, uh, a belt tightening time in the future.

468
01:01:46,510 --> 01:01:55,060
What would that change? Okay. So, of course, that, you know, if you look at this whole thing, that you'll always have something coming.

469
01:01:55,720 --> 01:02:03,180
Okay. At that instant, in this time interval, some water comes in, some water runs out.

470
01:02:03,190 --> 01:02:07,900
So there's a burst and that sort of thing happening.

471
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:17,140
They have a different rate. The rate water coming into this is the rate of beta and water coming out from this.

472
01:02:17,350 --> 01:02:22,540
I compare it with the rate of carbon. So there is something coming in, something come out.

473
01:02:23,470 --> 01:02:33,860
So we look at a chance. So you look at the current volume in that bucket and you look at how many how

474
01:02:33,860 --> 01:02:42,160
much water will run into this eye bucket and how much the water would go away.

475
01:02:42,170 --> 01:02:48,520
What what would go out from that bucket? So so that's something you're trying to figure out, right?

476
01:02:48,530 --> 01:03:01,070
So so this is the the the number of infected individuals, given the pace and you look at how many we're adding and how many.

477
01:03:06,260 --> 01:03:12,170
This is basically a, you know, that sort of the equation.

478
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:21,600
Of course, that to this the amount of water will run into that.

479
01:03:21,750 --> 01:03:25,620
I think it would depend on how what's the time interval you are talking about?

480
01:03:25,860 --> 01:03:31,259
Suppose that you open your tap and the water will come out one hour versus one minute.

481
01:03:31,260 --> 01:03:35,190
There will be different volume you can imagine, right.

482
01:03:35,490 --> 01:03:41,940
So it depends on the elapsed time in this case we're talking about is tenderness of time interval, which is don't have to.

483
01:03:42,690 --> 01:03:48,170
We're looking at the very small. At the.

484
01:03:54,490 --> 01:04:01,940
I like it. But then you have this elapsed time and tons of flow with it.

485
01:04:02,210 --> 01:04:06,090
Okay. Let's calculate this informally.

486
01:04:06,490 --> 01:04:16,479
How do you do that? Okay. So you work to a worthwhile individual to be able to move into the this person

487
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:24,760
has to meet the person has to meet a infected person or an infectious person.

488
01:04:25,390 --> 01:04:28,629
Right. You work for a guy, move you from best to I.

489
01:04:28,630 --> 01:04:33,490
This guy has to meet or contract the virus from infected person.

490
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:39,220
So what's the chance of that? Okay. Then you know, you have this many.

491
01:04:43,570 --> 01:04:47,780
Are on the risk. Okay. And then what's the chance that.

492
01:04:51,100 --> 01:04:54,190
I'll meet a person who is infectious.

493
01:04:54,460 --> 01:05:01,570
Right. That. Population or infectious divide the total number of population.

494
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:06,190
Just like random draw, you have a jar of balls.

495
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:09,850
You have i t mini Bosnian jar and now.

496
01:05:10,900 --> 01:05:16,870
No, I'm sorry. You have a n capital and many Bosnian jar.

497
01:05:16,870 --> 01:05:21,129
You have 80 many rare balls in the jar.

498
01:05:21,130 --> 01:05:25,300
What's the chance that you will pick up a right ball out of the jar?

499
01:05:25,300 --> 01:05:28,390
Right. So this is the chance, okay.

500
01:05:28,690 --> 01:05:37,780
And this is the speed. The number of individuals who are random randomly run into a person by chance who is infectious.

501
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:41,440
Okay, by normal process. Okay. If you think about independent.

502
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:45,060
So this is expected number of this. But what happens?

503
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:52,030
Is that one person who in fact, is not only just running into one person who's running to fade out there.

504
01:05:53,610 --> 01:05:59,170
Okay. So one one faster person can in fact, multiple person at the same time.

505
01:05:59,470 --> 01:06:05,310
So that's why you have this great times, this expected encounters.

506
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:11,130
So that's different rate. Oh, so.

507
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:20,390
So this one is more like what? Basically the volume of U water in the S bracket.

508
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:24,710
And this is kind of the unit the size of the tube.

509
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:29,510
Right. So. So this this side.

510
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:38,870
What? If you find a bike i t over n but this one some are bigger.

511
01:06:38,870 --> 01:06:46,040
Some are smaller. Right. So so the the the that that you is it over in.

512
01:06:46,550 --> 01:06:50,150
But now you have the size. Is not it over?

513
01:06:50,570 --> 01:06:52,930
This size is better. Okay.

514
01:06:52,940 --> 01:07:05,150
So the that's essentially defines the capacity that a of this define the capacity of water running through from this bucket to here.

515
01:07:05,240 --> 01:07:11,330
Okay. That's exactly. You know, the the way to calculate it is for.

516
01:07:14,580 --> 01:07:21,810
What? Okay, so. So you have the 18 individual.

517
01:07:23,990 --> 01:07:31,400
And you have this. So the size of two, which is gamma, then then you will run out from that.

518
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:39,770
Okay. So, so that's basically describe the chance that how likely the person will be to an infected person.

519
01:07:40,250 --> 01:07:47,540
And then then that happens. Well, what about this transition from compartment?

520
01:07:47,780 --> 01:07:54,930
Compartment? Likewise you can move the turn from here to left and by the by Delta T.

521
01:07:55,450 --> 01:08:05,220
Okay. Then you basically get this on on the right hand side and then this is by you.

522
01:08:05,290 --> 01:08:12,110
You can let the. Actor.

523
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:19,680
The limit tells how you go to zero and this default defines a derivative right to the default.

524
01:08:20,070 --> 01:08:27,950
You take the limit. The right hand side of the equation is independent of Delta has nothing of his delta.

525
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:33,840
So if you let Delta those two zero and. Derivative.

526
01:08:34,230 --> 01:08:41,580
Okay. So that's basically the equation that people know about for this, you know?

527
01:08:44,370 --> 01:08:53,900
Why are you called dynamics? Because here you are, all of derivative of this prevalence rather than the itself.

528
01:08:54,900 --> 01:09:07,540
You. You basically model the speed. So if you think about at instantaneous time point, this is really the the rate of change on that.

529
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:13,830
So this is the speed of the process.

530
01:09:13,860 --> 01:09:19,860
Now, this process is self, right? So to achieve the speed of change.

531
01:09:22,750 --> 01:09:28,480
But explain. I just skip this. Okay. So likewise that you can.

532
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:39,850
So you can divide this whole thing by the sample size of the of the population, size them to side.

533
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:47,650
So when you do by this by the thing, then essentially you turn everything into percentage.

534
01:09:48,970 --> 01:09:57,090
So you divide in and left in the right. So this becomes the percent percent of individuals of.

535
01:10:00,620 --> 01:10:04,120
This is. Yeah.

536
01:10:04,420 --> 01:10:09,970
So everything is like this. So. So you if you divide that, then you introduce this free communal test.

537
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:18,600
So using this sort of probability to define this kind of percentage.

538
01:10:18,900 --> 01:10:25,340
So this is kind of a empirical frequency for this probability.

539
01:10:26,100 --> 01:10:31,090
So if you introduce that, just going through the same argument.

540
01:10:31,110 --> 01:10:38,040
What you have here is the the derivative of the probability of being affected.

541
01:10:38,550 --> 01:10:48,390
Okay. It appeared to have been the chance of that between the factors you call to debate at times this.

542
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:49,170
Okay.

543
01:10:50,500 --> 01:11:06,350
And so this product essentially explained the probability as a second person meeting a new infected person and the time to under a random meeting.

544
01:11:06,420 --> 01:11:15,580
So so this tells you how likely that a specific person would be infected person by chance.

545
01:11:16,300 --> 01:11:25,390
This is the probability. And then this is the model that based on this probability, which I like, why I like it.

546
01:11:25,390 --> 01:11:37,600
Because when you divide about the N here, that the N disappears, that one asks the question not how could you assume that a is constant over time,

547
01:11:38,290 --> 01:11:42,910
which is certainly is not very reasonable where it is reasonable in the short period of time,

548
01:11:43,270 --> 01:11:48,880
but for long term, like you were kind of like more than half a year or even a couple of years.

549
01:11:49,240 --> 01:12:03,460
There is no. We are the royalty that the N is not involved in the formulation so that you can sort of get rid of this strong assumption.

550
01:12:06,170 --> 01:12:15,500
Well. This is interesting explanation about the the parameter.

551
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:30,280
Okay. And I think this interpretation really gives a different way of look at the asylum model and it gives the connection to survival analysis.

552
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:40,770
Well, so let me just explain this on. So as our emotions start to recover, compartment is absorbed, a compartment,

553
01:12:40,770 --> 01:12:46,750
someone asked this question, will they recover people back to the and the risk?

554
01:12:47,350 --> 01:12:55,500
Yes, for sure. And but here we just do not consider that maybe that model is only use use a very short period of time.

555
01:12:55,680 --> 01:13:01,430
And so every model has a assumption, right.

556
01:13:01,470 --> 01:13:06,440
All models are run by some are useful in that way. So but.

557
01:13:09,730 --> 01:13:11,230
In a way. You understand what I mean? Right.

558
01:13:11,890 --> 01:13:23,140
So did you assume that that they are oftentimes absorbed in the sense that whoever enters the are would not return to the infected in that dynamics,

559
01:13:23,590 --> 01:13:27,310
which can be relaxed? I will tell you how to relax that. But. Yes.

560
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:34,520
Reunification. This is a very strong assumption which may not be true for the disease and needs to be.

561
01:13:36,830 --> 01:13:40,520
Translation, Ruby Gama is afraid of losing effect. In fact,

562
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:52,150
the subject's due to the deaths or recovered to the observed compartment are also represents fraction of the fascist population that temporally of.

563
01:13:53,570 --> 01:13:58,320
It isn't per unit time. Okay. So this is really something.

564
01:13:59,130 --> 01:14:02,520
So what I want to emphasize is this point here.

565
01:14:03,150 --> 01:14:14,340
Suppose you have a comma equal to two point. So suppose if this transmission route from I to R is point two.

566
01:14:15,540 --> 01:14:23,160
What does it mean? Right. It means the vaccine component will delay or infections individual being recoverable.

567
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:35,080
That at the average rate of 20%. Well, if we trying to interpret in a different way, this is great.

568
01:14:35,110 --> 01:14:38,980
If you take the the reciprocal of that. Okay.

569
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:47,360
So so while verb gamma describes the expected duration over which a individual state in

570
01:14:47,380 --> 01:14:55,570
the fascist compartment and their the exposure to sufficient time for his or her surgeon.

571
01:14:55,870 --> 01:15:01,750
So this is this is what do we understand about exponential distribution?

572
01:15:02,530 --> 01:15:08,250
The rate is. Yeah, we are. Is a parameter exposure to speed.

573
01:15:08,550 --> 01:15:18,900
If you are willing to assume or you can imagine that the the time right of one

574
01:15:18,900 --> 01:15:27,220
steady this eye compartment follows a spatial distribution and is equal to two.

575
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:33,240
So basically one over gamma which is five days.

576
01:15:33,570 --> 01:15:38,430
Basically it tells you how long this person stay in the effects.

577
01:15:39,030 --> 01:15:45,210
Okay. Now we know that if I called Kelvin, usually you get sort of the ten days recover, right?

578
01:15:45,270 --> 01:15:49,560
Typically people say, oh, you'll be fine. After ten days, we will take test negative.

579
01:15:50,100 --> 01:16:02,760
Or people like CDC guidelines is that if you got infected by COVID only call you you should it stay in the home for like five days or seven days.

580
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:10,990
Okay. So that you, you know, you're. A contentious work to produce.

581
01:16:10,990 --> 01:16:20,080
It will have very little chance to. In fact, a lot of people, if that number of days recovered by CDC is the right number,

582
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:28,330
then you can directly work out the damage coefficient, which is really one over the two days.

583
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:37,530
If you have five days then gamma is point to end days that gamma will be 0.10.

584
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:47,080
So this interpretation is very, very useful and we have the same interpretation in the,

585
01:16:48,700 --> 01:16:55,450
in the survival analysis like survival multistate survival model.

586
01:16:55,630 --> 01:17:06,760
Right. So you know that in survival analysis we have this multistate model sort of modeling if it's.

587
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:20,010
It very move to. Look at a disease or something like that.

588
01:17:20,010 --> 01:17:28,130
Then you move to. Also this is multistate model in use of up.

589
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:38,499
A lot of people are trying to do this the more all of this passes by Cox regression essentially their model this if you

590
01:17:38,500 --> 01:17:45,100
put long here I mean just for communism I say that this is not the notation used in the multistate regression model,

591
01:17:45,490 --> 01:17:52,540
but if you're willing to put here like mimicking what we have that the mall will stands by what Cox

592
01:17:52,560 --> 01:18:00,390
regression because the lambda normal here is more like lambda is the your hazard is like your transparency.

593
01:18:01,030 --> 01:18:06,490
So. So. In. Survival noises.

594
01:18:06,850 --> 01:18:11,230
People use top small tamales crackers. It.

595
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:17,940
So you can bring individual information into this.

596
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:25,570
So there is strong connection of this Malcolm Farr model and survivable.

597
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:37,500
And then, I mean, unfortunately for people who are in this field, they are if it is epidemiology, they do not see the connection.

598
01:18:37,980 --> 01:18:46,049
I was a little bit surprised that, well, we have done a lot of things in Civil War history where we use cost model to model

599
01:18:46,050 --> 01:18:51,060
the transmission rate from one to another and we have software everything ready.

600
01:18:52,400 --> 01:19:07,690
I know we do. Now use this in that. This simple interpretation makes a connection between this field with the two boxes developing this evolve.

601
01:19:08,530 --> 01:19:22,059
And I just received a I'm the sushi editor of enter a place that is I receive a paper written by your guys and they're trying to do something similar.

602
01:19:22,060 --> 01:19:29,540
But I say, Hey, why don't you just see Cox regression and that that's really just what they want to do as this.

603
01:19:29,540 --> 01:19:36,339
So somehow says the out that there is a connection but if you really understand this connection,

604
01:19:36,340 --> 01:19:40,390
you can use existing software from civil analysis to models.

605
01:19:40,930 --> 01:19:44,290
Peter Using Cox for sure. Okay.

606
01:19:44,620 --> 01:19:50,769
Well, this is something not only for interpretation to figure out the parameters in the modeling,

607
01:19:50,770 --> 01:20:00,670
but also trying to bring existing toolboxes boxes that we develop in order for you into this field to do better modeling analysis.

608
01:20:03,340 --> 01:20:08,440
So. Okay, so click. Okay. I see you on Thursday.
