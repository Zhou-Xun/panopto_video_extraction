1
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:16,730
So at this point in your training, you've learned a great deal about incident or new disease and prevalence of existing disease in the population.

2
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:23,270
Typically, we talk about these as if they're separate entities, but clearly there's a relationship between the two.

3
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:31,460
For example, if we have a sudden increase in incident disease, then it's quite logical to think that prevalence would also increase.

4
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:39,620
Such a scenario would likely draw the attention of public health professionals to work on reducing the burden of that disease in the population.

5
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:49,930
Interestingly, however, it can also happen that some of our public health success stories result in larger prevalence of disease in populations.

6
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:56,860
For example, following the introduction of antiviral therapies to treat HIV in 1995,

7
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:02,050
there was a rapid increase in the prevalence of individuals with AIDS in the population.

8
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:10,750
Now, this was not because there was new disease development, but rather because the infected individuals were able to live longer with the disease.

9
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:17,730
In this video, we're going to talk about the interplay of incidence and duration with prevalence.

10
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:22,620
Specifically, I'll show you how to define the relationship between incidence,

11
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:31,560
prevalence and duration of disease under steady state conditions and how we can predict changes in any of these measures based on the others.

12
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:35,719
So to help with the concepts that we'll cover in this video,

13
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:42,800
I'm going to use the analogy of a bathtub to represent the relationships between incidence, prevalence and disease duration.

14
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:51,830
In this analogy, the water level in the tub reflects the prevalence of disease in the population or the number of people living with disease.

15
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:57,650
The spigot, which lets new cases into the population, reflects the incidence.

16
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:04,190
In contrast, the drains reflect the removal of individuals with the disease from the population.

17
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:10,040
Do either to death, cure with immunity or cure with renewed susceptibility.

18
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:15,140
Now, the faster that individuals with disease are removed from the population,

19
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:20,960
the shorter the duration of the disease and the slower that they are removed from the population.

20
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:29,280
The longer duration of their disease. So let's first take a scenario where there's some influx of incident cases into the

21
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:35,130
population and some removal of cases from the population due to deaths or cures.

22
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,950
If the influx of incident cases is much larger than the removal of cases, then the number of cases in the population will grow.

23
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:50,370
In contrast, if the influx of incident cases is small with respect to the removal of cases,

24
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:54,810
then we would expect to see a reduction in the number of cases in the population.

25
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:05,310
Now in certain special circumstances, it can happen that the incidence of new cases exactly matches the removal of cases due to deaths or cures.

26
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,910
Then the prevalence of disease is going to remain stable.

27
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:12,750
This condition is known as steady state.

28
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:23,070
Now let's try your hand at using the bathtub analogy to predict how perturbations in the system will influence the prevalence in the population.

29
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:32,290
Let's say that the influx of incident cases into population increases, maybe because of a greater prevalence of existing risk factors,

30
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:36,220
or there's an introduction of the new risk factor into the population.

31
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:44,080
Perhaps it could be that even a new surveillance system came into play and countered cases that had previously been unidentified.

32
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:49,629
Can you imagine what would happen to the prevalence in this situation where the incidence

33
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:54,940
increases but the outflow of cases from the population stays the same or goes down?

34
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:01,920
How about the duration of disease? Well, here were the incidence increases.

35
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:05,010
The prevalence of the disease in the population would increase.

36
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:13,140
Using the water analogy, you can think of more water flowing into the tub than flowing out, so the water level rises.

37
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:19,560
With this situation, you would also see the length of time that people live with the disease increasing

38
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:23,880
since they're not being cured or dying as quickly as they were before.

39
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:29,700
Now let's flip it and imagine this scenario where the influx of incidents,

40
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:34,770
cases into the population stays the same, but the removal of cases increases.

41
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:43,440
Perhaps this increase in the removal of cases from the population occurs because there's some new treatment that results in more people being cured.

42
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:50,490
Or maybe the outcome as an infectious agent that now becomes more virulent and fatal either way.

43
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:55,770
Can you now imagine what would happen to the prevalence in this situation where the incidence stays the same,

44
00:04:55,770 --> 00:05:00,180
but the number of people, the disease that die or the cure rate increases.

45
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:06,010
This scenario would result in decreased prevalence of disease in the population.

46
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:12,400
Again, with the water analogy, the waters entering the tub and being immediately drawn out through the drain.

47
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,480
Similarly, people are living less long with the disease when the cure or the fatality rate of a disease increases.

48
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:27,150
So hopefully you found this analogy helpful to interpret the relationships between incidents, prevalence and disease.

49
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:33,660
Now I'd like to also show you the math that underlies these relationships under steady state conditions.

50
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:37,959
Under study state or when a population is stable,

51
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:44,380
the number of new cases entering the population occurs at the same rate as those leaving the population.

52
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:53,410
The number of new cases is described on the left as the incidence rate times, the number of people at risk, and the time period of interest.

53
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,790
Their remove cases can be estimated using a removal rate times time.

54
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:02,840
Now, while we haven't defined this notion of a removal rate before,

55
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:08,360
it can be estimated as the number of cases divided by the average disease duration.

56
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:17,479
Using a bit of algebra, you can now show that the number of people at risk can be estimated by one minus the prevalence times.

57
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:24,280
The total population and the number of cases can be estimated by the prevalence times, the total population.

58
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:30,129
We can now cancel out the total population size and the time frame of interest from

59
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:34,930
both sides of the equation and get this final equation at the bottom of the slide.

60
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,750
Rearranging it one more time,

61
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:48,220
we get this equation that's shown in the top box because one minus prevalence is roughly equal to one when the disease is rare.

62
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:55,690
Under these situations, the formula can be further simplified to just prevalence equals incidence rate times duration.

63
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:03,850
When the disease is not rare, the formula for prevalence is a little bit more complicated but is still easily calculated as shown on the slide.

64
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:07,820
So let's try and put these formulas into practice.

65
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:16,910
Returning to the AIDS example from earlier, let's estimate the mean duration of living with AIDS in 1987 versus 1997.

66
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:23,000
Rearranging our first equation a little bit differently we can solve for the mean duration.

67
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:33,050
Doing so, we see that the introduction of effective treatment dramatically changed the survival of people of AIDS over just ten short years.

68
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:41,030
It started out with a mean duration of living with AIDS of about four years as compared to in the later years.

69
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:43,880
People were able to live with AIDS for nearly 20 years.

70
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:49,970
This means that while there were more people with AIDS in the population, our prevalence went up.

71
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:53,210
It's because the disease became more survivable.

72
00:07:54,590 --> 00:08:01,130
So in summary, we've covered in this video how prevalence is a function of incidence rates and the duration of a disease.

73
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:06,350
Using a bathtub analogy, we saw how reductions in incidence tend to reduce prevalence,

74
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:11,750
and we saw how improvements in treatment will decrease the prevalence and the duration of disease.

75
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:18,170
Similarly, we saw how reductions in mortality will increase prevalence and the duration of disease.
