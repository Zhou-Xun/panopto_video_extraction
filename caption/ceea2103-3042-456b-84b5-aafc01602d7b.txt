1
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:17,320
In this module, we will focus on written advocacy tools and as we discussed in the last module.

2
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:25,090
Written advocacy tools are one step in a broader set of steps in effective advocacy strategies.

3
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:30,700
These written materials do not exist in isolation or in a vacuum,

4
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:38,110
so preparation of these materials must be done in the context of that broader strategy.

5
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:46,360
After we have researched our problem, developed a goal, identified the decision maker,

6
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:51,190
honed in on specific messages that we know will resonate with the decision maker.

7
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:58,030
All of those points are important to include in the written advocacy materials.

8
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:05,750
I firmly believe that any advocacy strategy must include a one pager.

9
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:11,780
It is by far the most important advocacy tool, and there are a few reasons why.

10
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:21,560
For the author, the advocate, the writer, it's very helpful for us to hone in on specific messages,

11
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:33,800
to identify words that resonate with the decision maker, and to use the process of crafting that one pager as our way of crystallizing our thinking.

12
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:44,750
So honing in on exactly what it is we want to communicate that we know the decision makers will refer to over time for the reader.

13
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:52,460
It's very helpful to have a concise summary that explicitly pulls out the key points for us.

14
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:57,650
So it's important on both sides, the author as well as the reader.

15
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:04,310
These are routinely used in all types of settings, whether it's an organization,

16
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,750
whether it's my dean's office, whether it's the United States Congress.

17
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:11,600
So one, pagers are very, very common tools,

18
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:19,160
and they are the most important part of what I call leave behind materials that we talked about in the earlier segment.

19
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:24,320
A leave behind packet will include the one pager as well as other documents,

20
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:33,950
but it's often the item that is placed on the top of the packet and referred to during that in-person meeting.

21
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:43,760
I think it's helpful to go back to the origin of the one pager to understand how it became the currency in written advocacy.

22
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:51,680
It's a fascinating story from 1986 when the tax code was being revised.

23
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:55,160
And as you can imagine, in the tax code,

24
00:02:55,160 --> 00:03:03,230
there is sort of something for everyone and every type of special interest group has a provision one way or another.

25
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:13,610
So the number of amendments that were floating around and being voted on during consideration of that proposal, there were hundreds of them.

26
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:21,979
And in 1986, the members of Congress were still required to vote on the floor of the House of Representatives,

27
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:24,740
which is where the proposal was being considered at the time.

28
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:35,149
So the only time that the staff had to discuss these various amendments and proposals with the member of

29
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:44,000
Congress was the time between leaving the office and crossing the street to travel to the House floor?

30
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:51,890
So these amendments were moving so fast that the lobbyists and advocates and staff

31
00:03:51,890 --> 00:04:00,230
developed a process through which they had a quick one page summary This is the amendment.

32
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:06,530
This is the problem that it addresses. This is why this is the appropriate solution to that.

33
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:15,530
And here's how you should vote. And this this process of managing the number of amendments that were floating around and being

34
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:23,990
voted on sort of then led to the one pager being an expectation and an advocacy strategy.

35
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:32,150
So since 1986, you've seen a lot of one pagers on Capitol Hill and now in other settings as well.

36
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:39,020
So I use these in all of my effective advocacy strategies and in other ways.

37
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:42,290
And these are a few tips that I'd like to highlight.

38
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:54,240
Headings and sections that organize key points are so helpful for the reader and using things like bold and capitalization and underlying italics,

39
00:04:54,260 --> 00:05:00,800
sizing, having lots of white space that then draws the eye to the bullet points that are most important.

40
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:10,250
If there is data that can be helpful in providing a context or background for a goal that you're trying to advance,

41
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:15,590
the use of a visual graphs and charts can be very, very helpful,

42
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:22,820
not so far as the new kind of infographic that has evolved in just the last few years.

43
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:29,870
But incorporating elements of that infographic type of approach can be very, very helpful.

44
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:39,200
With the text. Avoiding long citations or kind of treatises is really helpful for the reader.

45
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:44,840
However, indicating the source can be important.

46
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:50,660
If the reader would like to explore further information, they will know where to go.

47
00:05:51,380 --> 00:06:00,830
Spelling out acronyms in public health. We have a lot of acronyms, and we can't expect that the layperson will understand what we mean.

48
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:07,430
So keeping it simple and recognizing that the reader may not have expertise or background in this topic.

49
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:14,420
So this is intended to be a very quick read and something that can be easily understood by the reader.

50
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:21,400
This is a potential structure that I think is a helpful way to approach writing a one pager

51
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:26,740
similar to the way that we do meetings using the eight minute rule and the oral communication.

52
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:35,440
In our written communication, we want to be very clear who we are, who we represent, and the goal that we're advancing.

53
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:40,570
The next chunk of text we want to describe the problem,

54
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:47,350
and this is where you draw on your education and your ability to do those comprehensive literature

55
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:53,470
reviews and access that data and understand it in a way that truly the layperson cannot.

56
00:06:53,740 --> 00:07:01,629
But using statistics and data to show the urgency of this problem that will motivate the

57
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:07,780
reader and the decision maker to take the action that you recommend and not to wait,

58
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:14,170
but to create a sense of need given the background data that you're able to share.

59
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:21,100
And then in the next chunk of text describing the solution, this is something that is so important.

60
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:28,390
We don't want to just describe the problem without leaving the policymaker with an action item to advance.

61
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:36,760
So noting why your specific goal is the appropriate response to this problem is so important.

62
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:46,300
So using any statistics, any research findings that we have examples of similar proposals that have moved forward in other states.

63
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:51,220
If we go back to our case study of the Smokefree workplace legislation,

64
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:57,760
we were able to draw on other states experiences with similar proposals to show

65
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:02,830
why this would be a great solution to the problem of secondhand smoke in Michigan.
