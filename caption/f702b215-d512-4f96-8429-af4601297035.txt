1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:05,260
Okay, everybody, I'll come back to being in person.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:10,200
Thanks for coming on Zoom last week while I was at a conference.

3
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:16,229
Today we're going to, I think, get to really the heart of this course,

4
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:22,290
which is multi-stage carcinogenesis modeling before we dive into the slides here.

5
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,350
Just when I talk through our learning objectives for the week,

6
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:36,060
so we're going to start by talking about the population level implications of the Armitage doll model, which we started last week in lab.

7
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:39,750
I'll play have a little bit of time today to work on that as well.

8
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:45,770
But we're going to move into the two stage clonal expansion model or TCE model.

9
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:51,240
Um, and the, what we call the initiation promotion progression paradigm.

10
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:55,050
Um, you couldn't find another P for that first one.

11
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:06,410
We're going to derive the differential equation model for the hazard of the TCE model, as with the birth death process last week.

12
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:10,309
We're going to go through some mathematics that, again,

13
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:17,900
largely want you to just see and have access to which you are going to be responsible for driving yourself.

14
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:24,860
Then we're going to simulate the TSI model and confirm the derived hazard under a constant parameter of assumption.

15
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:27,560
That will be the lab, which will start on Wednesday.

16
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:35,060
It is very parallel, very similar to what's being done in Lab eight, but we're going to do a lab with the archival model.

17
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,780
Lab nine will be the test model, but largely parallel.

18
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:45,590
And. So.

19
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:56,640
Before we sort of dive into. Talking about the modeling.

20
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,040
Let's talk about why we're doing the polling.

21
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:11,430
And so these graphs here are the log of the death rate versus the logging age for a number of different cancers.

22
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:17,460
And so we see colon, rectum, esophageal stomach, pancreas.

23
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:23,790
And the death rates for these cancers are almost linear on a lifelong scale.

24
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:36,800
And so what is a linear on a log log scale? So that means if you take both the log of the Y axis and the X axis here,

25
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:42,300
that in time, then we have the relationship likewise m times log of t plus b.

26
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:55,860
If I solve for y exponentially both sides, then I get to the analog t or if the one that's going to pull my t down into the b m is going to poke.

27
00:02:55,950 --> 00:03:03,090
And so I'm just left with the Y equals Q the M and this is the formula for what we call power law relationship.

28
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:17,480
Okay. So our modeling question really is why would death rates for cancer be on a power law, have a power relationship?

29
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:29,250
And so this is one of the motivating questions I'll say that is sort of towards this idea of multi-stage carcinogenesis models.

30
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:35,510
And these models together have are under, uh, uh.

31
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:40,030
This idea underpins those models.

32
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:46,720
The idea that cancer is a consequence of the accumulation of genetic transformations in a single cell or its descendants.

33
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:56,110
And what I like to emphasize here is that a lot of these models were in the early 1950s before DNA was even really discovered.

34
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:05,980
And so or at least the idea that sort of the ideal DNA structure, I think probably some amount of genetic understanding is probably understood.

35
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:23,260
Obviously, we Bendall was quite a bit before the 1950s, but the sense of kind of multiple hits to the genome was being developed long time ago.

36
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:29,649
So I'm interested of the 1950s TCE model,

37
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:34,510
which is really what we're going to be focusing on this class because it remains one

38
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:38,590
of the sort of most important person analysis models was developed around 1980.

39
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:47,860
These are all mechanistic, biologically based models. So they're not just statistical models empirically describing the data.

40
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:57,970
So again, let's remember from cancer research, cancer survival lecture, that survival is the probability of surviving until at least 20.

41
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,410
Survival might be not having cancer.

42
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:09,010
It might mean not dying of cancer. I'm going to have to leave that up to the specific situation.

43
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:16,840
But the hazard is the instantaneous rates, the rate of events, given that no event has happened yet.

44
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:27,520
So we have to it's this derivative, which is a little bit complicated to log derivative, negative long derivative of survival.

45
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:34,660
But we had this sort of conditional factor at least that we've looked at time. T What's the probability of an event in the next delta?

46
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:44,260
T As Dr. T goes to zero? And what's useful about the hazard is that it really corresponds to age specific incidence of events.

47
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:51,490
And since a lot of our data is a specific incidence of events here in cancer incidence,

48
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:55,540
but also cancer death, other events that this is extremely useful for us.

49
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:07,149
So broadly speaking, the goal of multi-stage carcinogenesis models is to use a mechanistic understanding of the underlying

50
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:13,840
biology to derive a hazard function typically in a closed form or maybe just a simulation based.

51
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:28,210
So if we have this theory of some set of genetic hits here, then that's going to allow us to derive in close form or otherwise, a hazard function.

52
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:31,970
And then that hazard function is going to let us connect to data. Okay.

53
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:38,650
So that's the big picture of what we're doing in this lecture or actually the next couple of lectures.

54
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:44,080
So we're not trying to theory that's going to give us a hazard function, added emotion and access to data.

55
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:52,000
So let's start with the armored dog model, which we introduced in the lab last week.

56
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:58,330
We start with added stem cells. STEM cells mutate at a rate not to precancerous cells.

57
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:05,490
Pre-cancerous cells continue to accumulate mutations, and then individuals have cancer or die of cancer.

58
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:08,890
We want to think about it depending on the situation.

59
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:14,290
When one cell reaches more than two and each of these are exponential patterns.

60
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:23,520
So we started looking at this in the lab as well.

61
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:28,170
What are the survival hazard relationships for the Armitage doll?

62
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:33,780
Well, let's say that p i of t is the probability that a thousand state type.

63
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:39,090
Then if an individual will get cancer, when there is a willingness out,

64
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:46,499
then the probability of not having had that so is one minus penalty in the lab and it was five.

65
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:51,930
So survival simply one minus p five of T for that.

66
00:07:51,930 --> 00:08:00,149
So since we have and stem cells, each of them are independent, then we're raising one minus penalty to the capital.

67
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:04,680
And that's your answer for question three or whatever it was for that.

68
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:11,520
We had this independence of cells, each cell. Probability that they're not in the Morgan State.

69
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:17,850
Okay, so if we have that survival, then we can write the hazard,

70
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:23,760
which we know is the negative log derivative or the derivative divided by the survival.

71
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:33,719
And although this is kind of like me looking, it's a little bit ugly as we begin to write it out using our chain rule for from derivatives,

72
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:42,930
from calculus, bring the end down and minus one times the derivative of the inside divided by the survival.

73
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:47,910
Simplify this becomes and derivative of one minus p in empty.

74
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,930
So what we need here is the m prime.

75
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:58,100
And here. Getting ahead of this.

76
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:05,660
Okay. So based on our knowledge of continuous time backup shipments from last week,

77
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:12,439
we can use the Common Core of equations to find the system of differential equations that govern the probabilities.

78
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:16,640
Panopto Japan and PM Prime. We can also write an equation for that.

79
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:21,830
So generally speaking, DDT of t is q.

80
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:27,050
Where Q is the matrix of transition intensities times p?

81
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:30,620
Where P is the matrix of probabilities?

82
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:42,590
For the Armitage doll model. That means we know that the.

83
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:58,080
It's like flipped. In light of what Chris is doing, the stem cells should be going here.

84
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:08,600
For a 0 to 1. Yeah, I think I have this, like, transposed.

85
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,650
I apologize about that.

86
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:20,780
We should be thinking about whether you whether stem cells go to state one state one cells go to state two and so on and so forth.

87
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:27,830
So be a little bit careful about that when you write it in your lab, and I will fix that in the lecture.

88
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:39,910
Okay. And then to get our set of differential equations.

89
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:46,230
I see. I see you step back here.

90
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:52,880
So. This is an incorrect way for this.

91
00:10:52,900 --> 00:11:05,830
Q It's just a little bit different than written so that the derivative of P zero is simply once leaving P zero here,

92
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:13,989
and then that derivative of P one is what's coming in from p zero and what's leaving

93
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:22,570
P1 is this mean just not reading the slides or recent enough to remind us all.

94
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:34,660
Okay. So this system of equations can be solved in closed form, but it's just like kind of ugly and there's no point in doing that for our purposes.

95
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:42,310
So we're just going to do it numerically. And these are pretty simple set of differential equations to simulate numerically.

96
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:47,410
I gave you the code to do so. It's broadly speaking, in the lab.

97
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:57,880
And so once we have penalty and PM prime, we can actually solve for the zero hazard.

98
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:05,380
But just to get a sense of what's going on, this is not the real answer, but to get a sense of what's going on.

99
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:12,640
We can note that P of t is much less than one and we can make a tailor series of approximation for the hazard.

100
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:18,760
And if we do that, and this is not part of the lab, but just for your information,

101
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:30,830
then we can get that the hazard is approximately and times the product of all the mutation rates times two and minus one over and minus one factorial.

102
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:35,560
And well, it turns out that this is actually a power law relationship,

103
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:47,260
so that if I have a log of h, a T is the log of this thing plus and minus one times log t.

104
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:57,760
And so if we notice that the slope of this is a minus one that tells you about the number of mutations.

105
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:03,130
So just looking at the population level data.

106
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:10,720
May tell us something about the number of cancer mutations.

107
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:17,470
Okay. So the question is like, does this really explain cancer death rates?

108
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:27,490
Probably not quite, because although it does fit reasonably well for colon and rectum and some other cancers,

109
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:34,270
we have to always remember that just because a model does fit the data doesn't mean it's the right model.

110
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:38,409
Right. It's just that that that model can't explain the data.

111
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:46,210
It doesn't mean that it's real, particularly when it doesn't really fit some of the other data that it should also fit or be able to fit.

112
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:53,530
So if we look at lung bladder, we're getting kind of way off our straight lines here.

113
00:13:54,760 --> 00:14:02,230
Also, if you look at some of the slopes for some cancers, you start to see, if I recall correctly,

114
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:09,700
numbers of mutations of the order of like 11, which just probably seems like a little bit too much to be realistic.

115
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:14,940
Okay. So this was the 1950s. It was the first try.

116
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:19,290
Yes. QUESTION Can you speak more specifically research with cancer mutations?

117
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:29,280
Right. So at the time, they are, I think, not really specific about what that is.

118
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:37,170
So what I'm going to say sort of generally speaking, is that there are a number of cancer genes that can be considered tumor suppressors,

119
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:47,310
meaning that that if there is like a retinoblastoma gene, a bunch of others,

120
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:55,770
that if that as long as that they are being active, that it's hard for cancer to happen.

121
00:14:56,130 --> 00:15:03,660
But if they mutate in such a way that that gene is no longer active actually being expressed, then cancer is possible.

122
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:11,280
They have to knock out our cancer suppressors and then we need a cancer promoter potentially so that

123
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:20,310
you may need a mutated version of something like MEK and that causes unrelated regulated cell growth.

124
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:33,090
And so as we'll see, typically you need at least two hits to the genome, sometimes three, sometimes less than your hereditary condition.

125
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,650
Um, 11 seems like a lot. That makes sense.

126
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:43,570
Okay. So I think next, I think I'm going to give you an example next.

127
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:45,060
So what's wrong with this model?

128
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:55,170
So the thing that we've kind of ignored in the Ahmadinejad model is that pre-cancerous cells usually have a growth advantage over normal stem cells.

129
00:15:55,170 --> 00:16:02,520
They grow faster, they expand. That's why we get tumors, because that's an I'm with excuse me, unregulated cell growth.

130
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:16,049
So if you have these pre-cancerous cells, then there are more cells that are further along in their mutation pathway and they are there.

131
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:20,580
Then there's more that are able to mutate further towards malignancy.

132
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:28,450
I think I have a picture that might be helpful in a second. Okay.

133
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:38,110
So historically speaking, a lot of the work happened over the next three decades from Armitage all down to here.

134
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:43,179
Mode of car. Benson and Newton around 1982.

135
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:46,450
Stage clonal expansion. Okay.

136
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:52,540
And so here, I think, is a particularly illuminating example, which is the case of retinoblastoma.

137
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:59,710
Retinoblastoma is a childhood cancer that forms in the archive, and it is very heritable.

138
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:12,760
So if you have retinoblastoma, your children are also likely to have retinoblastoma, and retinal may form in one eye or both eyes.

139
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:19,840
And what's interesting is that heritable cancers usually form in both eyes.

140
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:23,980
We call them bilateral, whereas the cancers that are not inherited.

141
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:30,570
So they're in children whose parents did not or not, did not have retinoblastoma are usually only in one eye.

142
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:34,900
Okay. That's already kind of telling us that maybe something is going on.

143
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:42,340
But more importantly to our purposes is that unilateral and bilateral cancers have different incidence curves.

144
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:51,580
So if we look at age in months, up to five years, and we look at the fraction of cases not yet diagnosed,

145
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,790
which is kind of a like weird way of showing incidence.

146
00:17:54,790 --> 00:18:05,440
But that's what was done in the 1970s when this was done, is that they have these two very different curves for bilateral and unilateral.

147
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:09,910
And so why is this so?

148
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:23,680
Alfred Knutson, who came up with this? His hypothesis was that two heads, two mutations are needed for retinal for the retinoblastoma gene,

149
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:28,629
which at this point doesn't exist, is he's hypothesizing.

150
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:34,900
It exists that there is so that there exists some tumor suppressor,

151
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:47,380
the retinoblastoma gene that needs to have two heads to it and that occurring at the somatic level in the sporadic form.

152
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:52,570
So somatic means non non-sex cell.

153
00:18:54,520 --> 00:19:01,630
So two heads in the non inherited form, one head and the inherited form is that the take away.

154
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:14,799
And so this hypothesis explain the data and kind of more excitingly for medicine actually predicted the exist of this existence,

155
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:20,140
of this tumor suppressor gene predicted in 1971 and the gene was discovered in 1987.

156
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:28,300
And in fact, we call it the retinoblastoma gene, even though actually it is a tumor suppressor basically for all cancers.

157
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:40,570
But because it was discovered in the context of retinoblastoma, that is it's given given the honor such as it is of that name.

158
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:53,250
Okay. And so this to hit hypothesized purposes of nude sense was kind of taken and cleaned

159
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:59,400
up a little bit and and expanded to be beyond more than just retinoblastoma.

160
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:04,200
By Morgan Carr who is my academic grandfather by the way,

161
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:18,510
and I have met once so my advisor's advisor and mind we had this idea that once you have normal stem cells that are initiated,

162
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:31,650
they are they grow faster, then they die at least compared to normal stem cells so that you have this kind of tumor growth.

163
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:42,950
So that initiation to pre-cancerous promotion of pre-cancerous cells towards tumor and then this conversion or progression to a malignant cell.

164
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,520
Um, so this idea of initiation promotion progression.

165
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:58,309
And the reason we care about initiation promotion progression, not only does it generally fit the data better as well,

166
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:05,570
sort of see you next couple of weeks, but it makes a big difference from the perspective of carcinogens.

167
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:14,750
So when we talk about a carcinogen or carcinogenic substance, not all of the substances are necessarily carcinogenic in the same way.

168
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:20,899
It's not just like you, you know, I know kind of like superhero movies are like exposed to this.

169
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:26,390
And instead of like immediately dying of cancer, like, I have superpowers in real life.

170
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:35,270
We generally want to distinguish between carcinogens that initiate cancer, so they react with DNA to cause mutations.

171
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:44,690
And then daughter cells inherit these mutations versus something that the promoter which causes proliferation of cancer cells.

172
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:53,420
So these typically don't interact with DNA, but they interact with some specific receptors or alter gene expression.

173
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:57,139
Cancer biology is not really my area of expertise,

174
00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:12,320
but there are lots of different sort of cancer promoter genes and certain substances can advance or promote them to,

175
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:23,329
you know, using the same word multiple times here. And so this distinction between the initiator and the project promoter makes a big

176
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:28,580
difference in terms of one's likelihood and the age of which one gets cancer.

177
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:39,050
Right. And then progression of that. Okay. So then sorry, I'm confusing myself.

178
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:48,300
I set this up. So that's initiation. Promotion progression is not really something that we specifically have carcinogenic substances for.

179
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:52,520
Usually that's kind of just like more initiators happening after promotion.

180
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:58,020
Now it's just that progression only happens after you get the sort of sufficient mutation.

181
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:06,940
Um, so that you have one initiator causes you to lose one copy.

182
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:15,160
A promoter comes in, makes more of those pre-cancerous cells that there's more pre-cancerous cells.

183
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:21,400
Another initiator is more likely to hit that second copy or to your second copy of the gene.

184
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:30,680
So this is all kind of well and good from a theoretical perspective.

185
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:35,030
I mean, I kind of really got into some of the biological details.

186
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:45,050
It's not really the focus of this class, but we want to take this initiation promotion progression paradigm and turn it into a mathematical formula.

187
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:50,150
So to do that, we're going to say that we have a number of stem cells.

188
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:58,340
We're going to assume that's constant just because then the number is can be huge compared to anything else.

189
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:01,550
Because really we're talking about like the number of cells in a liver,

190
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:09,170
the number of cells in your skin relative to a small number of initiated cells.

191
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:16,910
And then Z will be the number of malignant cells. We'll say that stem cells initiate at a rate and you're not.

192
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:26,900
And once you're initiated, you grow it right alpha this dietary beta and you progress to malignancy with rate me one.

193
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:37,029
So it's a fairly small number of parameters here. And we're going to do what we've continued to be doing.

194
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:40,480
It's a little bit more complicated now. Okay.

195
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:52,420
Here's a typo. It should be a Z. So the probability of a PJ of T will be the probability that you have j initiated and k malignant cells.

196
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:56,410
Given that you started with nothing, he's going to say.

197
00:24:56,860 --> 00:25:02,440
Now, if we want to talk about heritability, then, you know, maybe that's a different story and you want to put it in different numbers here.

198
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:05,860
But we're going to think about someone that has a blank slate.

199
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:15,840
And the probability generating function which we introduced last week is then PSI of wise is key,

200
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:20,880
which is the expectation of little y to the big y subtlety to the big z.

201
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,990
Keeping in mind that little y and little Z are dummy variables.

202
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:32,700
They have no real meaning. They exist only as placeholders, but big lie of T and Big Z of TR.

203
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:44,790
The actual numbers of cells. And so the expectation is the same over all possible values of initiated and malignant cells.

204
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:51,420
Probability of having that number with Y and Z is the K.

205
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:59,460
So we define T as the time of the first one. So that's going to be our event.

206
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,370
And so we're going to define survival and hazard in terms of this probability generating function.

207
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:10,230
So this is where probability generating functions are going to do a lot of heavy lifting for us.

208
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:16,920
So probability of T less than T means that K has to be zero.

209
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:24,310
We may know malignant cells. That means when I do my summation rather than writing, K is going to write zero.

210
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:27,660
And my son is now just over the number of initiate itself.

211
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:42,570
Turns out that it's very convenient that I can write this as save 10t because no matter this zero here is the zero of the zero.

212
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:47,280
And so anything I raise zero two becomes what?

213
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:56,640
What one? Okay.

214
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:59,610
So that's the survival.

215
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:07,050
Survival succinctly written in terms of the probability generative function and then the hazard I need to know also the derivative,

216
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:13,350
the probability, any question. So far, so good, at least in terms of setting up the problem.

217
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:23,299
So let's go back to thinking about our R probabilities.

218
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:29,290
So if I have j initiated and k malignant, where do I go from here?

219
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,010
Where did I get where does that come from?

220
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:42,410
Well, I can grow my cell by preconditioning cells that either happens with the growth or it happens with a new initiation.

221
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:51,640
And that could have happened and I could have gotten there if I had j minus one not to get in J.

222
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,980
Okay. So this is the kind of the J axis and then the k axis.

223
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:09,650
I got where I am from K minus one, two, k by mutation and one of the J cells.

224
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:14,330
We're thinking about this broadly as a mutation happens.

225
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:36,630
Creating one of each type so that we always have replacement when we do our mutations, because we're kind of like ignoring cell death.

226
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:42,550
We're not ignoring it. We're kind of sitting under the rug by doing this kind of replacement in our mutations.

227
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:51,200
And then I can get a new one by a new malignant cell by having a malignant conversion.

228
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:59,330
Okay. So that brings us back to the common core of equations for the probabilities.

229
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:11,120
So if I care about how my probability for Jane K are changing, well, I have all of my initial,

230
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:19,730
all of my new JS, my new pre initiated cells excuse me, my new initiated cells with the J minus one.

231
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:31,390
That's this guy. I have my cell deaths when I have j plus one cells.

232
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:43,010
That's this guy. And then leaving or starting.

233
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:50,150
I still still have one more. I get a lower net conversion from a K minus one.

234
00:29:50,750 --> 00:30:01,590
So that's coming up. So I mean, pointing at the screen is really not helpful for people watching this again reported.

235
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:13,260
Then this final line is everything that's leaving the j k cell or position.

236
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:22,080
So that's any cell growth, cell death, slowing down conversion or a initiation.

237
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:28,520
Okay. So these are fairly straightforward to.

238
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:33,590
Right? If you kind of just like sit down and think about it, um, but what happens next?

239
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:41,180
So we're going to multiply both sides and sum by this y to the jay z to the k.

240
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,710
Y and z are dummy variables taking actually number of cells.

241
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:51,650
And we're gonna have the forward common ground equations for the probability generating function.

242
00:30:53,200 --> 00:31:02,720
Um. We're not going to go through the math of that, but you can kind of get a get a feel for it.

243
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:10,340
What's nice is that on the left hand side, you have derivatives under a generating function.

244
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:18,290
With respect to T and here with respect to Y, this is a first order partial differential equation.

245
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:24,860
And I'm not sure many of if any of you have had a class on CDs.

246
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:30,770
It's okay if you haven't, but it's a first order partial differential equation,

247
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:39,110
which means that we can stop it from anything higher than first order becomes much more difficult.

248
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:42,730
There's a lot of theory involved in any first order pressure.

249
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:48,770
The differential equation can be solved by the method of characteristics, and this is the method of characteristics.

250
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:53,210
So again, if you don't have math in your background, don't worry about it.

251
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:57,170
I just want you to have seen it. I want you to access it to it in the slides.

252
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:01,790
But I'm not going to make you do it at any point.

253
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:14,450
So, um, if this is the general method of characteristics, some function you of two variables x and T often we think about as position and time,

254
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:22,640
but uh, it doesn't have to be that and it satisfies different first order differential equation.

255
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:35,510
So we have the first order, the derivatives for the two variables, plus some function of the variable itself.

256
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:47,230
So then we have characteristic curves which are essentially how position and time change over this other dummy variable.

257
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:59,780
S And if I write my differential, my, if I pretend that these functions A and B,

258
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:05,150
which are the coefficients on the first order partial differential equations.

259
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:11,990
I pretend that these are derivatives of X and T with respect to s.

260
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:18,650
Then this transforms the PD into this very simple function.

261
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:24,140
Dudes is c times u equals zero.

262
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:30,940
And that's much easier to work with than whatever nonsense we had before.

263
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:46,180
Not nonsense, but you know what I mean. So for the TSA model, what I'm doing is looking at the coefficients of the two partials and you itself.

264
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:51,760
So what I see is I move this over and it just has a one in front of it.

265
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:57,910
Here is all of this.

266
00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:04,750
Here is my other coefficient in front of this partial.

267
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:12,550
And then here's my my you the CI and the stuff in front of it is my C.

268
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:24,870
So it divides with all of this nonsense. Do you see this has to be zero in the TDs.

269
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:35,710
Has to be more. If I do this this transforms the PD of CI into.

270
00:34:35,890 --> 00:34:41,320
Simply decides is one minus y minus one times.

271
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:49,899
Muse zero times. X times. And so this is just a straightforward, not partial,

272
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:58,810
but ordinary differential equation that I can solve for as the exponential of the integral from zero to t of this expression.

273
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:03,970
Y minus one. New Times x Diaz.

274
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:12,160
But now I have to remember, y is actually a function of this is the function of my characteristic w variable.

275
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:20,800
Okay. So I need to know why it is for every value of best.

276
00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:32,300
So we're solving for y we're trying to find s of t is view of one zero and t.

277
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:41,420
That means I know that y that time t has to be one so that this is true.

278
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:47,360
This side though. So the first position is a one and that corresponds to y.

279
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:53,960
So I'm solving this other ordinary differential equation subject to the condition y of two equals one.

280
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:07,190
It's a little bit tricky because we're increasing our value of Y at time t

281
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:14,740
and so we actually need to integrate backwards from T to any previous value.

282
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:18,010
S. S actually has the same. Uh.

283
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:26,800
Uh, let's say span as time because GH equals one.

284
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:35,470
So so it's just a shift of t it has the same, the same progression and t is the same progression and that's.

285
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:46,660
So since we're starting at TI, we actually need to integrate backwards to get to zero.

286
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:56,979
So we're going to do is define Tao as T minus S, the time between one's current age T and some previous H.

287
00:36:56,980 --> 00:37:06,970
S. And so then we're going to integrate Tao as a positive from zero to T, but that positive just goes from where we start all the way back to.

288
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:16,750
And so I've transformed my differential equation to be not as a function of mass,

289
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:22,960
but as a function of how this makes our lives a little bit easier from the integration perspective.

290
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:28,990
And so you're probably not expecting like this level of like deep differential equations here.

291
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:33,910
Don't worry, I'm not going to use it for anything other than the outcome.

292
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:40,090
But I think it's important to see it. So now I have a set of differential equations.

293
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:48,890
My x is just going to be y. X two is the derivative y with respect to time x three.

294
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:53,830
Is this differential equation integrated from t -20?

295
00:37:54,400 --> 00:38:00,850
Again, this is the equation for my probability generating function.

296
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:11,660
And then the negative derivative of the log of x three is going to be x four.

297
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:18,050
So crucially, x three is S50 x four is the hazard function.

298
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:27,210
So at the beginning, the big goal of this all is to make theory, to get to h of t h of t is going to bring us to the table.

299
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:44,810
So to simulate this, to stage an expansion model, we need to solve these four differential equations when those initial conditions in the corner.

300
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:51,860
So I don't it doesn't matter to me if you want to forget everything else you've seen in this section of the lecture.

301
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:57,200
But if you want to come back and say, how do I do the two stage one expansion model?

302
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:03,800
This is the slide you need to refer or not, remember. But I can come back and look up because who's going to remember this?

303
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:09,860
I don't. I mean, every time I go back to my thesis and I'm just like, what are the equations for this?

304
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:14,010
Did I derive this correctly? Okay.

305
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:25,650
What's funny? What's funny about these is that you have to solve these sets of equations for every single value of T independently,

306
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:32,310
because this title doesn't correspond to your real age.

307
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:41,130
It corresponds to the dummy variable that you that needs to integrate all of your your experience.

308
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:48,180
Physically, it's your cumulative. It's this idea of the cumulative exposure over your life to this point.

309
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:54,360
And so at each one, you solve a set of differential equations.

310
00:39:54,630 --> 00:40:00,390
At age two, you solve a set of differential equations going all the way back to zero three, you set this differential equation.

311
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:02,430
So differential equations going back to zero.

312
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:08,189
And each time you go back to zero, progressing forward, that makes this a little bit computationally intensive,

313
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:13,200
even though any individual run of these is not that computational intensive.

314
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:19,400
Okay. So make our lives a little bit easier.

315
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:26,420
Let's assume for a moment that alpha beta you serum you want are constant over our lifetimes.

316
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:38,840
And this may very well be true in the context that you're not exposed to carcinogenic compounds, which, you know,

317
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:47,510
we know that people are, you know, even things like HPV is a cancer initiator and that depends on age.

318
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:53,240
And so but taking a step back, assuming that they're at least broadly constant,

319
00:40:53,510 --> 00:41:01,280
then there are closed form solutions and we don't have to solve the differential equations.

320
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:05,900
And so for constant parameters, it has the form.

321
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:12,840
The survival is quantity Q minus over Q if the minus p,

322
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:23,600
t minus up to the -50 all raised the value are when you can take the derivative, uh, negative log derivative and get the hazard there.

323
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:27,559
And these are a function P and Q are not our parameters.

324
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:33,680
Pink, Q and R are a function of alpha beta x three and.

325
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:52,810
So what's going on with this PCU in LA? So what we've seen is that Alpha, Beta, V0 One and X do not individually impact the hazard.

326
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:57,160
So they're not identifiable and cannot be uniquely estimated from the data.

327
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:03,460
Instead, these three parameters are identifiable parameter combinations.

328
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:12,100
Okay. So this is important because what it's telling us is if we look at the data and see some curve,

329
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:18,010
we can't determine like the true tumors growth rate, generally speaking.

330
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:24,160
But we can we can observe these values so that it helps us to be able to interpret these values.

331
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:33,010
And so the way that we generally associate them are as zero alpha.

332
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:36,850
We generally think of this as the initiation parameter,

333
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:47,800
or it's not so much that this is the initiation parameter as changes to initiation are reflected in this parameter.

334
00:42:48,370 --> 00:42:50,320
This is the only place that you've seen these zero.

335
00:42:53,010 --> 00:43:04,050
P If we were to solve or to approximate this, uh, if we forget about this alpha me one for a second,

336
00:43:04,890 --> 00:43:11,010
the square root of the square simplifies these terms of the same.

337
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:20,640
And so what you're going to get is that P is approximately the negative of alpha minus beta.

338
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:25,890
And so this has to do with growth, minus death.

339
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:33,540
This is the promotion parameter. And then finally progression.

340
00:43:34,830 --> 00:43:38,040
We could do some alternative things going on here.

341
00:43:39,070 --> 00:43:42,600
Um, if you, if you take the plus instead of the minus,

342
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:50,090
what you get is approximately one over one minus been over alpha because the only place that mu one shows up.

343
00:43:50,130 --> 00:44:00,600
We often think about this is the progression parameter. We're making a couple of like throwaway assumptions here like, okay, this is a constant.

344
00:44:00,810 --> 00:44:09,360
So this value Q is not actually the mutation rate, but any changes in mutation rate will be reflected in this parameter.

345
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:20,430
Okay. So that is what I have for today. Any questions? I know I threw a lot of math at today,

346
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:33,389
but the big takeaway here is that we have this initiation promotion progression paradigm and we have underlying

347
00:44:33,390 --> 00:44:41,310
mathematics through modeling that are going to connect this initiation promotion progression paradigm to data,

348
00:44:42,870 --> 00:44:52,499
which I think we'll get to in two weeks or so for lab time, which we'll do on Wednesday, we're going to basically do the same thing.

349
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:55,170
We're doing it Lab eight, which I assume we will continue today.

350
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:04,500
If there's time here, there's plenty of time and we're going to confirm that our theoretical hazard matches the simulations,

351
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:09,900
and I'll give you plenty of code as well. So any questions?

352
00:45:11,610 --> 00:45:14,999
If not, we'll stop here, let you get back to the amortized.

353
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:28,229
Almost so by when you say that they reflect the initiation, promotion, the parameters or fact or initiation progression regression.

354
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:32,100
But they are. Yeah.

355
00:45:32,210 --> 00:45:42,800
So in a couple of weeks we will merge the two stage colon expansion model with each period cohort models, for example.

356
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:52,700
And so what you might say is if they have an age period or cohort from an age because for assuming age independent but a period or cohort effect an R,

357
00:45:52,700 --> 00:46:03,290
P or Q, then anything you multiply by R can be thought of as being a multiple of multiplied by you.

358
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:10,010
Not so. We don't really think that like tumor growth is going to change necessarily, but exposure to carcinogens might.

359
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:35,999
Okay. And what we'll typically see is that actually a lot of changes in cancer incidence are can be seen as fitting best as changing initiation as

360
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:50,250
opposed to promotion of progression through these parameters interpretable as in like you see like a high value for a promotion for peer.

361
00:46:50,940 --> 00:47:02,429
Yeah. You'd be like, okay, yeah. So what we would say is you could compare two cancers to this two stage one expansion model and you would say which

362
00:47:02,430 --> 00:47:12,390
cancer tumors grow faster and you would say I based on my fit of the two stage inspiration model and this value of P,

363
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:19,350
I think that this cancer grows faster from a population average perspective.

364
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:24,630
Can you compare the exact values, say like it's a ring a piece twice as much?

365
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:34,780
Yes. Okay. Yes. Okay. Okay.

366
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:43,880
Could you go over the the diagram with the blue boxes then you know where they're not the cool.

367
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:53,830
Okay. So the idea here is to say, what are the rates associated with each of these transitions?

368
00:47:55,600 --> 00:48:09,640
So let's first look at the transitions and we care about this specific box of where we are currently with J initiated and cabling and cells.

369
00:48:10,330 --> 00:48:14,200
First question is, how did we get here? Well,

370
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:23,950
we could have come from a situation where there is one fewer initiated cells and then either there was

371
00:48:23,950 --> 00:48:34,060
a growth of of an initiate itself or a stem cell had a mutation that takes us from J minus one to J.

372
00:48:36,090 --> 00:48:44,910
So that's why I like that a alphanumeric system so that either eve or the two things you said.

373
00:48:45,270 --> 00:48:51,659
So either I initiated cell split the two.

374
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:59,070
Yeah. So that's alpha AJ minus one. Yeah. Or a stem cell had an initiation mutation.

375
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:10,450
Okay. To me zero times X so if. It could also have been the case that we had j plus one initiated cells, but one of those died.

376
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:14,280
So beta times j plus one. Okay.

377
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:20,940
It could also have been that we had one fewer malignant cells,

378
00:49:22,110 --> 00:49:29,730
but one of the initiated cells had had a malignant transformation, a new one times jack.

379
00:49:31,530 --> 00:49:35,490
That's all the ways that we could have gotten to where we are. Okay.

380
00:49:37,290 --> 00:49:40,650
What are all the ways that we leave where we are?

381
00:49:42,450 --> 00:49:46,280
Well, it's the same processes, but in different directions.

382
00:49:46,290 --> 00:50:00,090
So if we have a cell and initiated cell growth Alpha Jay or another initiating mutation in zero x that moves us to the right,

383
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:05,820
we have a cell death of initiate cell with better times j taking us to the left.

384
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:18,570
And if we have K initiated cells, we can get to this one initiated cells with an initiated cell moving a conversion so a new one times j.

385
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:24,600
So malignant cells, they don't die in the model. So typically speaking.

386
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:35,090
Because the model ends as soon as we have a single case we just like typically don't bother model like that.

387
00:50:35,750 --> 00:50:45,200
Yeah. But um, what I will say is that the next version of the model has multiple stages,

388
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:51,110
initiated cells, and each of them have actually been approved back here,

389
00:50:53,630 --> 00:51:04,880
here and there that you might have multiple different sets of pre initiated cells, each of which could have clonal expansion.

390
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:08,720
Okay, depending on how fancy you want to get.

391
00:51:09,410 --> 00:51:16,580
What I generally say is that like if you have multiple rounds of clone expansion, it's not identifiable anyway.

392
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:21,560
Um, so you want to be careful about just like slapping.

393
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:29,870
I've seen some like, very bad papers in the literature and, um, predatory journals where they're like,

394
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:39,470
we fed up to 15 stages of clonal expansion and like, if the 10th was the best, I'm like, that doesn't mean anything.

395
00:51:39,890 --> 00:51:45,680
And you're like, at that point, they'll look the same and it's not biologically based.

396
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:55,280
What does it mean to need ten, you know, prediction initiation stages for a lung cancer or I think the breast cancer in this case,

397
00:51:55,970 --> 00:52:03,860
it's not really biologically plausible, especially when I think for breast cancer, like a two stage model, that's basically just as well.

398
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:09,950
So we'll be careful about that. Other questions.

399
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:18,540
Stop us here.
