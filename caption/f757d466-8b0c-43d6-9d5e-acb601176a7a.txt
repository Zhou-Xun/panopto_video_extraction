1
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,730
Welcome to unit two.

2
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:13,290
In unit one we talked about

3
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:15,750
basic concepts of environmental
health sciences and

4
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,910
also started to
introduce the concept of

5
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,220
important environments
where people spend time,

6
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,320
in this case the workplace.

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,180
In unit two we're going to cover

8
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:25,890
five additional areas or

9
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:28,365
environments where people
are potentially exposed.

10
00:00:28,365 --> 00:00:30,150
These include air pollution from

11
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:32,550
the air people breathe,
water pollution,

12
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:34,305
solid and hazardous waste,

13
00:00:34,305 --> 00:00:37,740
urban and global health as
well as the built environment.

14
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:39,690
Let's focus in on
the first section

15
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:41,580
we'll look at which
is air pollution.

16
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:43,490
We're going to talk about a
number of different things.

17
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:45,365
I'll give you an introduction and

18
00:00:45,365 --> 00:00:48,560
an overview of some key
concepts with air pollution and

19
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,840
then we'll talk about how to
control air pollution with

20
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,185
a specific focus on certain
criteria air pollutants.

21
00:00:54,185 --> 00:00:55,790
That's what we'll talk
about. What you're

22
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:57,380
going to do is assess some of

23
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:58,775
the potential health outcomes

24
00:00:58,775 --> 00:01:00,680
associated with air pollution.

25
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,540
You're going to
rank the impact of

26
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:04,220
different air
pollutions according to

27
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:06,425
available surveillance
and research data.

28
00:01:06,425 --> 00:01:08,060
You're also going to evaluate

29
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:10,580
potential air
pollution controls and

30
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:12,650
consider potential sources
that we might look

31
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:15,695
to for information
about exposures.

32
00:01:15,695 --> 00:01:17,300
In section two, we'll switch

33
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,115
gears and talk about
water pollution.

34
00:01:19,115 --> 00:01:20,750
I'll again give you
an introduction and

35
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:23,180
an overview of some key
concepts and we'll again

36
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:26,075
talk about how to control
or clean water pollution

37
00:01:26,075 --> 00:01:27,560
and focus on some specific

38
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,585
very important water pollutants.

39
00:01:29,585 --> 00:01:31,475
What you're going
to do are assess

40
00:01:31,475 --> 00:01:33,320
some of the potential
health outcomes from

41
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,240
water pollution and you'll rank

42
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,770
the expected impacts according

43
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:38,420
to the data that
we have available.

44
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:39,710
You'll also assess some of

45
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:42,470
the potential controls that
we have available to us

46
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:44,360
for water pollution and also

47
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,030
consider sources of
exposure information.

48
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:49,370
In section three, I
will again give you

49
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:50,870
an introduction in this case

50
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:52,370
to solid and hazardous waste.

51
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:54,005
We'll talk about how we dispose

52
00:01:54,005 --> 00:01:56,015
of solid waste specifically.

53
00:01:56,015 --> 00:01:57,050
Then I'll walk you through

54
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:58,850
a seminal hazardous waste event

55
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:01,535
and tell you how we dispose
off hazardous waste.

56
00:02:01,535 --> 00:02:03,485
What you're going to
do is actually conduct

57
00:02:03,485 --> 00:02:06,215
a household hazardous
waste inventory.

58
00:02:06,215 --> 00:02:09,635
In section four, we'll focus
on urban and global health.

59
00:02:09,635 --> 00:02:11,135
I'll introduce you to the topic.

60
00:02:11,135 --> 00:02:12,770
We'll talk about important issues

61
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:14,780
like population pressure and

62
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:17,060
the epidemiologic transition and

63
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:18,320
what you're going to do is match

64
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:22,465
different diseases to
epidemiological transition stages.

65
00:02:22,465 --> 00:02:25,160
Finally in section five
built environment,

66
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,710
we will introduce the concept
of the built environment.

67
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,390
We'll talk about
different levels of

68
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,360
the built environment
that we can consider.

69
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,530
We'll also focus on
community design and how to

70
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:35,810
promote active
transportation and what

71
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:37,520
you're going to do is evaluate

72
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,095
the built environment
characteristics

73
00:02:39,095 --> 00:02:40,765
of your own neighborhood.

74
00:02:40,765 --> 00:02:42,590
So by the end of unit two

75
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:44,075
you're going to have
an understanding of

76
00:02:44,075 --> 00:02:45,530
important basic concepts for

77
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:47,210
water and air pollution as

78
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:49,190
well as for solid
and hazardous waste.

79
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:51,260
You'll be aware of
some existing and also

80
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,225
emerging issues with regards to

81
00:02:53,225 --> 00:02:54,620
urban and global health

82
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,240
and finally you'll
be able to describe

83
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,670
the relationship
between your health and

84
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:02,634
public health and the built
environment around us.
