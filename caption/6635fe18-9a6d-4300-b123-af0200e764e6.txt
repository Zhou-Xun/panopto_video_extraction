1
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:11,330
All right. Good afternoon, everybody. So just before we get started, I want to make sure that we had a couple more people coming in.

2
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:16,439
So I just want to make sure you guys are in the correct session. This is the session for applying to the PhD program.

3
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:21,530
So if that's what you're interested in after your MPH, then this is the session for you.

4
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:29,850
If not, the med school session is happening virtually, so that one is on zoom and a zoom link should be posted in the campus site.

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:37,530
So we're going to go ahead and get started. We have two current students.

6
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:42,750
I'm going to have them introduce themselves and they're going to tell you about the application process

7
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:47,819
and they're going to tell you about their experiences that they had or are having in the program.

8
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,850
And then you guys will be able to ask any questions that you might have.

9
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,500
That sounds good. It'll be very informal today. All right.

10
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,600
Well. I think we'll sit up here.

11
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:07,609
Hi. Wherever. Okay. Hi, everyone.

12
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:12,320
My name is Sarah Skolnick. I am a third year Ph.D. student.

13
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:17,720
God, what is my research? I was doing it this morning. I don't remember.

14
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:27,670
I do lung cancer and mathematical modeling or mathematical modeling of diseases with a behavior that has a stigma attached to that behavior.

15
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,940
So I look at lung cancer and smoking STI kind of stuff.

16
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:35,140
So. Yeah. Okay.

17
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:36,850
So I'm Rachel.

18
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:47,349
I'm also in my third year of the Ph.D. program, and I do research on perinatal epidemiology and also psychiatric epidemiology and fun fact.

19
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:52,180
We also went to our masters here together, so we've known each other a while.

20
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,420
I guess, the application process.

21
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:09,580
So I guess the most important part that we both thought was actually like finding a mentor to an advisor for the Ph.D. program.

22
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:14,620
So I actually worked with my current advisor during the master's degree.

23
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:19,630
And then that's kind of why I decided to apply here and continue working with him.

24
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,559
Yeah, definitely for I think, VP programs in general,

25
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:36,120
it's really about finding a mentor because unlike other programs where you get your master's with the Ph.D., most people come in with the master's.

26
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:40,250
Mm hmm. But, yeah, I'm trying to think. Oh, I.

27
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,800
I discovered I took a class that I thought was really interesting.

28
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:51,090
Mathematical modeling of chronic and social behavioral stuff with Michael Hayashi.

29
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:56,069
And I started taking more math modeling classes and then meeting more professors through that.

30
00:02:56,070 --> 00:03:04,050
And I didn't formally work with any of the people in my masters, but I just was taking their classes and then they connected me to people.

31
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:10,110
So I guess reaching out, I think, is really important for the Ph.D.,

32
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:17,730
and I wish I had done more of that and sooner because because you can just like you can email people.

33
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:23,430
And I had really good responses from other schools too, where like even if that person didn't have funding for that year,

34
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:28,590
they would refer me to someone who had similar interests and funding, and then I would connect with that person.

35
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,010
So if there's a school you're interested or a department you're interested in,

36
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:36,720
I highly recommend emailing them early and saying like, I'm interested in your research.

37
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:44,969
Do you have any recommendations? Is there anyone in your department that's looking for students next year and that

38
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:48,960
does something similar to you or or are you looking for students next year?

39
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,709
Because I got I got good responses with that. Yeah.

40
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:59,470
Early what you say would should they start because since they're second year students this is their last full year here.

41
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:04,060
So how early would you say they should start reaching out to to those people?

42
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:14,170
I think right now, like as soon as you can, since this is like a really important part of the application process for effort specifically.

43
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:22,540
Whereas other schools, you kind of are just admitted to the school in general and you're admitted to like an advisor specifically.

44
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:26,139
So that's like really important. Yeah.

45
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:33,299
If you're applying this year, I would reach out now. But if you're applying like next year, maybe over the summer or spring,

46
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:41,140
and I would ask a professor because like in this department when they think professors are most available because they'll tell you like, oh,

47
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:45,930
no one's answering emails in this moment in time because we have finals,

48
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:52,359
no one's answering emails over here because so they kind of know what other professors like when other professors are more responsive to emails.

49
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:58,899
Yeah, I would say to just as well as your elite projects like how you were if you were reaching out over

50
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:02,979
the summer and you weren't getting responses is because professors don't work over the summer.

51
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:11,410
So if you're interested in applying next year, I will kind of still reach out to them before the end of the spring.

52
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:18,900
Does anybody have any questions specifically about PTSD programs?

53
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,810
I'm going to take the microphone. I'm coming.

54
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:40,820
Is there benefits to staying at U mesh or did you guys strongly consider other schools?

55
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:46,490
I think there are definitely benefits to staying here.

56
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:50,490
I think you can you're more familiar with how we teach things here.

57
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:55,890
So I think you can complete your degree potentially quicker if you have your masters here.

58
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:02,890
Yeah. So I applied to three schools. I got into University of Michigan and Columbia.

59
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:10,800
And University of Michigan and Columbia are ranked very similarly. So that was kind of not super important.

60
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:15,060
I made my decision based on who I wanted to work with.

61
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:20,860
I love my advisor. I think your advisor is really important.

62
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:28,260
I actually I have co-chair, so I love both of my advisors and I think I would decide on a school,

63
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:33,320
knowing what I know now and about other people's experiences is I would decide it solely based on like.

64
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:39,970
My advisor. And I mean, there's only so much you can predict from if you're going to be working well with someone.

65
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:43,960
But if you get good vibes. I would I would follow that.

66
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:48,300
Thank you. No more questions.

67
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:54,990
Okay. Somebody she said she just took a bite.

68
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:08,220
So if you came from a non research base undergraduate degree, are you hindered in applying for PHC programs?

69
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:16,480
No, I did not have a research background in my undergrad at all and even in my masters I didn't.

70
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:24,120
I think Rachel had has had much more of a research background, especially the master's, maybe a little bit, but I don't think it matters.

71
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:41,530
I didn't. Yeah. Did either of you take a gap year slash as third year students?

72
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:54,059
Would you recommend or discourage a gap year? I took two years to work after my undergrad, so I then went straight through from the master's to Ph.D.,

73
00:07:54,060 --> 00:08:02,690
and I didn't really feel like I wanted to work again between the Masters and Ph.D. because I was pretty set on going for the Ph.D.

74
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:08,219
So I think it is good to work at some point in your between your studies.

75
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:15,710
But I happened to do it just before the Masters. I tried out a 9 to 5 job and hated it.

76
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:19,970
So maybe it's good to try that out and discover if you like.

77
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,370
I mean, there's pros and cons,

78
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:29,329
but working in like a hierarchical business structure was not a good fit for me and is a good fit for some other people.

79
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:37,280
There's like freedoms and good things from it too. But yeah, I guess I'm asking more specifically, like I took a couple of gap years after undergrad,

80
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:42,950
but I'm wondering if it would be beneficial to take a gap year or two after the Master's to get some research experience?

81
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:48,580
Because choosing a PhD program is a much more specified choice than choosing a master's program.

82
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:56,779
So I guess I was. But yeah, I think that is an interesting thought, especially if you don't know really what you want to research specifically.

83
00:08:56,780 --> 00:09:02,900
That might be a good way to figure it out. I mean, you can also figure it out in your PhD.

84
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:06,280
Like there is a lot of freedom to kind of do what you want research wise.

85
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:10,700
I don't know how general your interests are at this point, but not very general.

86
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:20,270
Okay. So you could probably apply to a PhD and that's part of the process too, is kind of figuring out what you're into and narrowing it down.

87
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:24,620
So that happens in like the first or second year. Yeah.

88
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:30,920
Yeah, I agree. That was helpful. Question.

89
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:41,800
More questions. Who is interested in actually applying for a Ph.D.

90
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:53,010
Yeah. Okay. So if you guys are interested in applying, you will have any questions at all and you got this all figured out.

91
00:09:53,820 --> 00:10:03,140
Can I ask who's applying? Is anyone applying like this round? Couple over there where you guys are both epidemiologists.

92
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:09,170
Yes. Yeah. Mm hmm. Is there anybody who's interested in applying to a different program that's not.

93
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:16,350
Do you have any questions about that that we might be able to answer? No.

94
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:21,830
I'm curious about what the programs are. I know some people who have gone to like sociology departments.

95
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:26,190
What do you mind if I ask? I think it was you throwing in a few over here.

96
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:34,680
With suffering. I'm really thinking like disease, ecology, maybe something more bio focused.

97
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:38,980
I'm thinking something similar. Something similar. Yeah.

98
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:50,399
Yeah. Well, um, I think that some people from our master's cohort definitely got into Ph.D. programs at Michigan in other fields,

99
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,890
too, so that's definitely possible.

100
00:10:54,130 --> 00:11:00,220
I think to you guys that the reason why we're here and we're doing this too is so that you guys can build those connections.

101
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:07,660
Because if you're building a connection with Sarah and Rachel, then they may know other people that they can connect you with.

102
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:10,840
So that's why I'm trying to get you guys to ask question.

103
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:24,990
Sorry to hog the microphone, but how do you find the work life balance between you and Masters?

104
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:31,740
Is there a big difference or is it like more 9 to 5 as a C or is it how does it work?

105
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:36,440
Yeah, I think it's really up to you like you can work whenever you want.

106
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:40,979
So if you have like particular hours, you find yourself more productive.

107
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:43,770
You can try to make sure you're like working during that time.

108
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:51,810
For me, like, I'm, I'm in a process of like finding that out and like trying to get a go to work life balance.

109
00:11:51,810 --> 00:12:01,720
But for me, I've been trying to like limit working within like 9 to 5 or even like 12 to 5.

110
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:06,780
Um, and I think that that helps me like keep stress down.

111
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:11,329
So, yeah. I'm terrible at that.

112
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:16,050
And Rachel's actually like my personal hero in terms of that because she'll, like,

113
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:20,780
wake up at a reasonable hour and then work until a reasonable hour and then live her life.

114
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:27,049
And I don't do that. I'll like wake up at like 12 and then work until two in the morning or something insane like that.

115
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:30,920
And then I won't work the next. It's crazy. Don't do what I'm doing. Do what she does.

116
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:35,290
You can do it. You just have to make a choice. I have to make a choice, too.

117
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:44,310
Yeah. And then also, I'm one of my friends in the program is like a night owl, so I'm pretty sure she does all her work after midnight.

118
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:57,550
It's fine. Will you use the mike so that it can get on the recording for the other students?

119
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:04,310
So as someone who's not planning on applying to programs this fall,

120
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:10,430
how would you suggest building connections with professors during, you know, a gap year or two while working or whatnot?

121
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:16,870
I'm definitely this year through your capstone.

122
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:26,290
And also I think a lot of people like work at a speech for a couple of years after they graduate, which is really good for meeting professors.

123
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:28,979
Yeah.

124
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:37,740
I would say if you if you have an idea of what school you want to go to or even if you just want to go to a different part of the country or work,

125
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:46,559
I don't know. I definitely think I recommend working with a professor in a university someplace in a field that you're interested in,

126
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:52,560
and then they can kind of open up connections for you and also your professors and your classes.

127
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:58,680
Like you're still building connections this year and you don't know, maybe you'll meet a professor that you really get along with.

128
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:06,889
Well, and that'll present opportunities and. So you're building connections this year and then next year maybe try and get a

129
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:11,810
research position at either this university or someplace else in a related field.

130
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:21,740
I would say to just this shameless student services float, we have several events that our faculty come to for you guys.

131
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:27,380
That's what it's for. Now, you guys know about the second year meet and greet is tomorrow, actually.

132
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:34,100
And so those are what that's what that's for, for you to build those connections with those faculty members,

133
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,930
not just for patient programs or just for your elite, but even for letters of recommendation and things like that.

134
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:47,090
So we want you guys to build those can those lifelong connections or now and for the future.

135
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:56,530
Yeah. I think sometimes with those events you can like really you could really like kind of match with a

136
00:14:56,530 --> 00:15:01,389
professor based on like research interests and vibes and whatever and just really get along with them.

137
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:04,930
But also the professors in your classes where you've done really well, like they've seen your work,

138
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:08,649
you know, if you do a research position next year, then they'll see your work.

139
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:14,080
Like anyone who's able to see your work, that's like the best thing.

140
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:18,050
Yeah. I'm sorry.

141
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,850
Also doing some mic hogging here.

142
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:29,660
I guess my question this question is about like the transition from MPH to at Michigan seems pretty self-explanatory, right?

143
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:32,270
Like it's easy to connect with faculty. There are events to go to.

144
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:38,090
And so I guess what I've been struggling with more is I'm interested in other programs at other schools.

145
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:41,130
And so I guess you said that you had applied to other places.

146
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:46,430
It's the number of programs and professors and research out there is really overwhelming.

147
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:55,790
So how like, how did you go about doing that research and narrow like narrowing it down to two professors at two schools like that I think is the.

148
00:15:56,710 --> 00:16:04,990
Yeah. Yeah. So I didn't narrow it down for Columbia as much as I narrowed it down here.

149
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:13,839
But I knew they had a strong biostatistics department and I was looking for, you know, there's different tracks you can take, right.

150
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:17,920
And different interest you can have. And I'm methods based, modeling based.

151
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:25,240
So I needed a strong department with statistical modeling kind of stuff going on in

152
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:32,020
conjunction with the AP department and Columbia also has some great like SGI groups going on.

153
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:38,770
So I, I guess I picked like, I don't know, maybe 20 schools to look at.

154
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:43,870
And then I started looking at what the schools have to offer, like going on their pages, seeing their professors.

155
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:48,819
I also think another way to do it is if you have any papers that you're reading that you really

156
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:52,330
like or any research that you're really interested in looking where those what schools,

157
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:55,810
those people are coming from is another good way to do it.

158
00:16:56,260 --> 00:17:05,589
I also asked like my capstone advisor, where because I was my research, I guess my research is very specific.

159
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:10,600
So there's only so many schools that I could apply to, but I know a lot of people applied to like I applied to three schools.

160
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:16,630
I know a lot of people apply to like 15 schools. So I think.

161
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,190
It's hard because I think you probably want to prioritize.

162
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:25,320
Your time is like spending some time on like maybe three or five schools really tailoring that

163
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:31,139
application to them and doing some research on what professors you want to work with there.

164
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:37,830
And then the other schools you can kind of maybe more generally apply to and you just like what their department has to offer more generally.

165
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:42,490
But yeah. Yeah.

166
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:49,210
I think that's really good advice. I actually only applied here, so I can't really comment on this, but I agree.

167
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:57,640
I can speak to that as well. I'm not given a Ph.D., but I'm a doctoral student right now and I kind of looked at it the same way.

168
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:02,890
I looked at it going into undergrad, kind of like you said, what they had to offer,

169
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:09,610
the amount of money they were offering me, how I thought I might fit, even though I'm doing it online.

170
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:17,110
At one point I wanted to be on campus or how I thought I might fit in the campus community if there were people that looked like me.

171
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:25,930
So those all those things that went into my mindset of what school to choose for undergrad, I kind of use the same kind of modeling.

172
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,130
When looking for my doctorate program.

173
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:35,990
Yeah, I think one of the reasons I applied to Columbia is I wanted to go back to New York because I'm from New York, so.

174
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:42,330
Yeah, but I love my advisor so much here that they were the reason I stayed.

175
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:47,469
Yeah. I also had another thought. And then I forgot it.

176
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:51,180
So it. My question.

177
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:02,810
So all of those of you who are thinking of applying, are you thinking the ones that are thinking of applying an effort?

178
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:08,450
Raise your hand. Oh, sorry. I just thought of my thought also for peachy program.

179
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,800
The amount of money they offer you they should be paying for you.

180
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:18,660
Like entirely. Really? They should fully fund you.

181
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:22,290
That's a job they're paying you to do. Research. Okay.

182
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,610
Sorry. Does it?

183
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:42,970
I was going to ask if you could talk about your interview process or where you interviewed here, because I know some schools require interview.

184
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:47,590
Can you talk about that process, too, and talk about how you want to tell the story?

185
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:57,570
Right. Yeah. So I think it's a little different if you're applying to interview here or elsewhere.

186
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:01,810
Like I know here, they invite people to the interview day.

187
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:06,220
Like if you've already kind of have like a potential faculty match.

188
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:12,849
And then for students who didn't do their master's here, like, it's, I think a lot more general.

189
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:21,490
Like they're really like interviewing with multiple professors and like seeing if there is someone that they can match with.

190
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:27,070
So I think it's different depending where you're applying, like here versus other schools.

191
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:36,040
Yeah. What was the question again? I answered part of what I wanted to say, but I forgot the question.

192
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:41,920
I think you answered it. I was just I was just curious about what the interview process was.

193
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:48,100
Yeah, sorry. I distracted Rachel because I was really awkward and weird on our interview day, and it's really funny.

194
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:59,530
Yeah. So our interview process was for here is like you get a panel of like three professors that interview you to make sure that you're not,

195
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:04,480
like, really insane in some way, essentially.

196
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:12,760
And then you have interviews with potential mentors, and then they'll match you with a mentor, and the mentor will match with you.

197
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:15,700
Whereas in other schools, like for Columbia,

198
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:24,429
they had a professor that had generally similar interests to me call me and talk with me and then ask if I was interested.

199
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:32,950
Like kind of get an idea of what I was interested in and then kind of see if I wanted to make connections with other people or whatever.

200
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:38,140
But I think that was the professor that called me was the one that was able to take students and most interested.

201
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:43,389
Yeah. And then so this just kind of goes back to what we were saying earlier about

202
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:48,070
like finding a potential match if you are able to connect with the professor,

203
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:54,610
you know, now before interviews come around that will make your interview day like a lot easier on

204
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:59,970
you since you have kind of already established a relationship with with the professor.

205
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:18,760
We have more. I guess I have one more question.

206
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:21,909
When you were doing the application process,

207
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:32,560
do you think the emphasis is on your statement of purpose or your research that you're interested in or is a grade that they're looking at?

208
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:41,080
So what exactly? I know at the end of the day, they look at it holistically, but what are the key points that they're usually looking at?

209
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:47,180
Yeah, I think grades do matter to an extent.

210
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:53,120
But then showing that you understand what research is like and you have kind of a topic

211
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:57,890
in mind is also really important and which is through your statement and purpose.

212
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:02,139
Yeah. I think it really depends on the situation.

213
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:10,240
I mean, I think generally they look at you holistically, but if you're already talking with a professor in a department, so you hear feedback.

214
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:17,049
Um, if you're already talking with a professor in a department, then they'll just flag your name.

215
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:19,209
I'm not sure anyone reads your statement of purpose.

216
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:25,240
Like, if a professor is, like, interested in you in some department, they might look over your statement of purpose,

217
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:28,870
but they'll like, look at your grades and look at whatever and they'll like.

218
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:31,340
If you've already talked with a professor,

219
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:35,840
let's say you started emailing the spring and have a whole relationship with a professor at a different university.

220
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:42,739
They might not. They might talk to you and get it might be more like an interview that way or like applying to the job that way.

221
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:46,940
And then it's kind of a formality to write the statement of purpose.

222
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:52,549
I mean, you want to do it, you want to do a good job, but and then schools where you don't have that connection that you've built,

223
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:55,970
perhaps they're probably going to be looking more at your statement of purpose and.

224
00:23:57,070 --> 00:24:04,770
Anything that you can have that kind of stands out. Statement of purpose is just an opportunity to stand out a little bit more.

225
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:13,170
I also have a question about the research interests. Like when you reaching out to the mentors too, you're like, Oh,

226
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:23,520
do you recommend to include a formal research proposal document in an email or just summarize your research interests in a paragraph?

227
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:29,010
Yeah, I not I would not send them like a formal research proposal.

228
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:36,470
I would send them. I would send them like a kind of more informal email being like, I'm applying here.

229
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:43,290
She programs your research, focus on them. You want to compliment them too, you know, like, I mean, not so much, but you want to be like,

230
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,469
I'm so excited about your research and like, I'm interested in that, too.

231
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:50,940
And do you are you taking students next year or do you know someone who's doing stuff like you that's like,

232
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:57,569
so cool that is also taking students or is taking students and then they will follow up with you.

233
00:24:57,570 --> 00:25:02,700
Like I've had, I've had I've started conversations like that and then I've had professors email me back and say like,

234
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:06,560
Hi, like, I'm so excited that you're interested. Like, Can I see your CV?

235
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:12,300
Can I, you know, how can we set up an email or phone conversation at some point?

236
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:31,570
Got it. Thank you. Well, ladies, I want to say thank you for coming.

237
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:38,290
If you could leave your contact information just in case they have other questions, that will be great.

238
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:42,510
You can read it on the board. Who needs us.

239
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:56,070
And the boy, if you will. Yeah. And then do you guys have any questions for me?

240
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:03,260
Are you guys planning to come to the meet and greet tomorrow? Yes.

241
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:13,000
Does everybody in this room have an elite adviser? Yes.

242
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:20,920
Or in the process of getting one. Nobody needs help with Ali.

243
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:29,070
Okay. So I just want to make sure you guys keep an eye on the canvas page.

244
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:34,150
We did have to swipe something, so there should have been an announcement that was sent out.

245
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:38,590
Um. And if there is nothing else.

246
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:51,709
You guys are either free to hang here or. Make a run for it is up to you so that you can process questions on your application

247
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:59,580
process and no great thing at all and try to have fun and enjoy yourself and not try to.

248
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:40,799
I was reading. I don't know why he's making this noise, and I really am trying to turn this off.

249
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:54,000
The owl is still watching me, so I think it still, according to my asking now or like something about it or like what?

250
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:04,950
I should look out. Yes, I really.

251
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,230
Do you know?

252
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:22,160
What is your last name? Clark. I just want to make sure you're on the email list.

253
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:26,120
That was a possibility, but not your second life.

254
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:47,370
Yeah. Everybody, let me tell you, I don't know because I'm just like, we are one patient here and I never heard about that.

255
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:52,830
So I think left less of a washer dryer as much as a general idea.

256
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:59,790
You know, I think that maybe I mean, it could be okay.

257
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:04,799
Okay. One. And I mean, I'm not addressed it like I don't know.

258
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:08,160
But I just because it's a personal choice right now.

259
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:13,140
And then once I get back to my office, I will make sure you write to me on my behalf.

260
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:16,500
So I apologize. You know, I say I'll be sure.

261
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:21,810
Okay. Thank you. Yeah,

262
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:38,610
I just noticed that there's no evidence that open there is there was no one is going to open that for anybody

263
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:51,640
that questions for me I'm trying to this book that I told you all so I know if the report that I have.

264
00:29:54,240 --> 00:30:01,500
Okay. Yeah.

265
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:05,760
And I'm just like, okay. So.

266
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:19,040
The effects are knocked out and I don't know how it was done for research, but it's future application will be used for research.

267
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:26,580
But I'm also not sure it works. I'm sure it has nonacademic reach, but I'm not sure if that's going to be implemented in 90.

268
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:35,750
That's I created like this story. So it's a panel that was created.

269
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:49,500
But it's just I'm not sure that I see what he was under.

270
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:57,220
So it's based on the kind of characters and scenarios married with.

271
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:05,560
So we would not like to name. I wonder how they see it.

272
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:19,610
So do you believe they're doing it for, like, this part of the program?

273
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:38,440
Yeah. And it says something we're about to as a father.

274
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:44,130
Yeah. Yeah, I feel the same.

275
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:56,140
I'll check with Laura about. This is not doing the things that my friends will.

276
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:24,320
Do you guys have any other questions? Absolutely.

277
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:36,220
Yeah. We've had enough in terms of its field reports.

278
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:50,310
Your loan is a very. The microphone can't hear anything.

279
00:32:52,270 --> 00:33:02,930
It's. Like anything else.

280
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:17,270
I just. I know it sounds.

281
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:35,130
Several people. Yeah, I.

282

00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:55,240

But I think. We'll see.

291
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:12,800
People. Every plan is going to be like.

292
