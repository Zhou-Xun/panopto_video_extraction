1
00:00:10,105 --> 00:00:16,090
Today, we're gonna address our first skill, asking effective questions.

2
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:20,245
We're gonna describe the differences between open and closed questions.

3
00:00:20,245 --> 00:00:25,782
And we're gonna learn a particular strategy called the Goal Post question.

4
00:00:25,782 --> 00:00:28,151
So what are effective questions?

5
00:00:28,151 --> 00:00:31,494
Are they always open ended?

6
00:00:31,494 --> 00:00:37,369
So first of all, open questions are fundamentally different than close

7
00:00:37,369 --> 00:00:44,031
questions in that closed questions are structured to obtain a yes/no response.

8
00:00:44,031 --> 00:00:45,997
Here's an example.

9
00:00:45,997 --> 00:00:49,268
Are you very sad today?

10
00:00:49,268 --> 00:00:51,278
The open version of that would be how are you feeling today. In the open version,

11
00:00:51,278 --> 00:00:57,109
we're casting a broader net and we're encouraging the person

12
00:00:57,109 --> 00:01:02,182
to use their own words, develop their own narrative.

13
00:01:02,182 --> 00:01:06,263
Also, effective open questions are devoid of any biases or

14
00:01:06,263 --> 00:01:09,532
multiple questions within a single question.

15
00:01:09,532 --> 00:01:15,580
So we would avoid things like have you finally started to take your medication?

16
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:18,640
You can feel the bias in that question.

17
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,493
Now on the left are the classic open ended starters, to what extent,

18
00:01:23,493 --> 00:01:26,935
how often, tell me about, help me understand.

19
00:01:26,935 --> 00:01:32,017
And on the right are sort of the classic closed ended starters did you,

20
00:01:32,017 --> 00:01:34,014
will you, can you, is it?

21
00:01:34,014 --> 00:01:38,723
Let's go back to the open column and look at three in particular.

22
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:42,465
What, if any, when, if ever and how much if at all.

23
00:01:42,465 --> 00:01:46,532
Notice we've added those kickers if any if ever if at all.

24
00:01:46,532 --> 00:01:50,951
The purpose of including those extra words is to communicate

25
00:01:50,951 --> 00:01:55,470
to the patient that never and not at all are possible answers.

26
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:55,970
That can depressurize the situation so the person doesn't feel they have to sort of

27
00:01:55,970 --> 00:02:01,559
create a response. So for example rather than saying

28
00:02:01,559 --> 00:02:07,753
what have you tried to quit smoking? We could say when

29
00:02:07,753 --> 00:02:12,103
if ever have you tried to quit smoking? I hope you can see how the latter version

30
00:02:12,103 --> 00:02:17,228
includes never or zero as a potential answer.

31
00:02:17,228 --> 00:02:20,187
Here are some other potential open ended

32
00:02:20,187 --> 00:02:25,392
starters you could use in your practice. Typical day.

33
00:02:25,392 --> 00:02:28,069
Tell me about a typical day with you and

34
00:02:28,069 --> 00:02:28,599
food. Tell me about a typical day with you and

35
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:32,874
exercise. A typical day with you and smoking.

36
00:02:32,874 --> 00:02:35,345
Typical day with you and your diabetes.

37
00:02:35,345 --> 00:02:38,333
It's just a nice conversational,

38
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:43,225
low threatening way to start a conversation compared to.

39
00:02:43,225 --> 00:02:47,112
This can help to interpret objective data

40
00:02:47,112 --> 00:02:52,832
like weight or blood levels. For example, today your BMI or

41
00:02:52,832 --> 00:02:57,790
your weight was blank. How does that compare to your weight or

42
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:01,304
BMI six months or a year ago? The same with something like

43
00:03:01,304 --> 00:03:04,542
alcohol intake. I see on the questionnaire you completed

44
00:03:04,542 --> 00:03:08,275
in the waiting room that you're drinking about 15 beers a day.

45
00:03:08,275 --> 00:03:10,762
Rather than over interpreting that,

46
00:03:10,762 --> 00:03:13,793
we instead recommend you ask something like,

47
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:18,689
well how does 15 beers compared to what you were drinking six months ago or

48
00:03:18,689 --> 00:03:20,455
a year ago. 0- 10 and

49
00:03:20,455 --> 00:03:23,221
0- 100 can be used in many ways. We're gonna use it later in this course to

50
00:03:23,221 --> 00:03:27,419
ask about importance and confidence. But you can use it in many ways,

51
00:03:27,419 --> 00:03:32,342
such as on a scale of 0-10. How scared

52
00:03:32,342 --> 00:03:36,134
are you on a scale of 0-100? How excited are you?

53
00:03:36,134 --> 00:03:39,612
Now, let's look at a couple more questions

54
00:03:39,612 --> 00:03:42,888
on this slide. First of all, tell me about

55
00:03:42,888 --> 00:03:47,730
days when it's gone well/not so well. This is a very nice way to find

56
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:52,530
out what they've tried in the past and what might be the focus of your efforts

57
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:54,923
moving forward. The final question,

58
00:03:54,923 --> 00:03:59,342
to what extent does this surprise you? This can be very powerful extension of

59
00:03:59,342 --> 00:04:03,445
the comparative strategy. So let's say you're revealing their blood

60
00:04:03,445 --> 00:04:07,534
sugar level, their A1C or their lipid level and it's either higher or

61
00:04:07,534 --> 00:04:11,921
lower than it was last time. It's often very elucidating to ask, well,

62
00:04:11,921 --> 00:04:15,902
to what extent does this surprise you or were you expecting this?

63
00:04:15,902 --> 00:04:17,774
Their answer to that will often

64
00:04:17,774 --> 00:04:21,878
lead to a discussion of what their exercise and diet has been like for

65
00:04:21,878 --> 00:04:23,537
the last couple of months. Now,

66
00:04:23,537 --> 00:04:28,583
let's talk about the goal post strategy. This is a very effective way to talk about

67
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:33,456
delicate topics. This is a way to discuss things for

68
00:04:33,456 --> 00:04:38,646
which your patient might not wannna openly disclose their opinion or

69
00:04:38,646 --> 00:04:41,680
their behavior. Let's come up with a couple of ways

70
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,154
we might want to do this. So

71
00:04:43,154 --> 00:04:48,727
let's think about the case of too delicate topics,

72
00:04:48,727 --> 00:04:53,511
gay marriage and abortion. Obviously it's clear that these

73
00:04:53,511 --> 00:04:57,992
are politically sensitive topics for which there is strong opinions on either side.

74
00:04:57,992 --> 00:05:00,718
When that's the case, we might wanna

75
00:05:00,718 --> 00:05:05,189
use the strategy as follows. Some people feel that gay marriage is

76
00:05:05,189 --> 00:05:06,988
a sin. It's an abomination.

77
00:05:06,988 --> 00:05:09,379
The bible says so and society must do

78
00:05:09,379 --> 00:05:12,323
whatever it can to stop it. On the other hand,

79
00:05:12,323 --> 00:05:16,409
other people feel it's a completely normal part of human sexuality.

80
00:05:16,409 --> 00:05:18,682
LGBT folks deserve the same rights as

81
00:05:18,682 --> 00:05:22,728
anyone else and society should protect that right for marriage.

82
00:05:22,728 --> 00:05:23,510
What are your thoughts?

83
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:25,195
Where are you?

84
00:05:25,195 --> 00:05:28,017
The key is to establish a safe space so

85
00:05:28,017 --> 00:05:32,029
they can answer anywhere between those goalposts.

86
00:05:32,029 --> 00:05:34,009
You're trying to communicate that you

87
00:05:34,009 --> 00:05:38,091
don't have a horse in this race that you're not expecting a particular answer.

88
00:05:38,091 --> 00:05:40,182
Now you don't need to do this for

89
00:05:40,182 --> 00:05:44,442
sort of lighter topics like did you have breakfast this morning or

90
00:05:44,442 --> 00:05:49,294
do you have health insurance. It's okay to ask those more directly.

91
00:05:49,294 --> 00:05:50,923
But use this strategy when

92
00:05:50,923 --> 00:05:54,851
you are discussing things for which you might be concerned that

93
00:05:54,851 --> 00:05:59,743
the patient might edit the response or might be embarrassed to contradict what

94
00:05:59,743 --> 00:06:04,143
they think is your opinion. A variation on the two point goal post

95
00:06:04,143 --> 00:06:08,427
strategy is the three point goal post strategy here adding in

96
00:06:08,427 --> 00:06:12,156
the middle stay the same and no change. You might wanna use this.

97
00:06:12,156 --> 00:06:14,597
When you're asking about a new medication

98
00:06:14,597 --> 00:06:17,983
you tried a couple of weeks ago and the patient has come in and

99
00:06:17,983 --> 00:06:22,219
you wanna ask, well, how are your symptoms better, worse or no change?

100
00:06:22,219 --> 00:06:23,122
And finally,

101
00:06:23,122 --> 00:06:28,016
when we're asking about medication particularly adherence, we recommend

102
00:06:28,016 --> 00:06:32,491
you ask it in the doses missed frame. So as you can see in the past month,

103
00:06:32,491 --> 00:06:37,127
how many doses, if any, have you missed? Now you might say why be so negative?

104
00:06:37,127 --> 00:06:38,402
Why assume the worst?

105
00:06:38,402 --> 00:06:40,317
Well it turns out in our experience that

106
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:44,203
when you frame it as doses missed, you're sending a meta message to the patient

107
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:48,130
that I'm not expecting perfection. It's okay if you've missed a few.

108
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:50,072
So the 2nd and 3rd options,

109
00:06:50,072 --> 00:06:53,427
frame it in a more positive doses taken. However,

110
00:06:53,427 --> 00:06:58,196
we have found that option 1 is particularly effective to get an accurate

111
00:06:58,196 --> 00:07:02,165
recall on the part of your patients. So today we have defined for

112
00:07:02,165 --> 00:07:05,709
you what is the difference between open and closed questions.

113
00:07:05,709 --> 00:07:07,895
And we've provided you with some specific

114
00:07:07,895 --> 00:07:13,199
ways to ask open questions that we hope will be effective in your practice.
