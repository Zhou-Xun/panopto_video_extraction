1
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:26,330
Hello, sorry to many technical details to deal with.

2
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:35,900
OK, so today I should have started with our check in.

3
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:47,720
Actually, so we're going to continue our discussion from the other day where we kind of ended the slides halfway through,

4
00:00:47,720 --> 00:01:01,730
we were talking about payment mechanisms because this week we started last week talking about expenditures, what we spend on health care.

5
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:06,920
We've been talking now about like, OK, prices and the role of prices.

6
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:13,100
Some of the role of prices is how and what is paid.

7
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:20,960
And in health care, that is not just like people pay cash for the service that they're getting or people pay with credit cards,

8
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:30,680
fee for service like we do in lots of other industries. There are all these different payment mechanisms that we've been talking about.

9
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:37,250
And today we're going to talk about some of the recent changes to payment mechanisms

10
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:43,970
that are related to not just paying for the service when it's delivered or provided,

11
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:48,050
but thinking about the role of quality in that.

12
00:01:48,050 --> 00:02:00,890
So that's what we're going to talk about today. And so I know people have a really most of you have a very busy week with a very busy Wednesday.

13
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:06,620
So but maybe so maybe that's what you're thinking about accounting.

14
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:19,940
But of course, the payments and prices, you know, show up in a lot of different ways in accounting so you can stitch them together if you like.

15
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:28,160
Or you could take this brief time to not think about counting today, if you like.

16
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:39,800
So let's share. And I'm going to want people in the back half of the class to contribute today,

17
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,640
not because people in the back half haven't been, but a little less likely.

18
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:54,330
So want to get some hands that from people that we haven't been we haven't heard from.

19
00:02:54,330 --> 00:03:05,760
Nate, your article oh, I see something, think about it, when you wrote it cost me my policy memo,

20
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:12,810
somebody wrote it on like this program, how to expand benefits for people.

21
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:18,120
Something I found interesting is that people out there knew every six months or so for me,

22
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:27,720
I suggested we do 12 so people can have some more security throughout the year and then how the cost is determined for white families.

23
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,770
And it was just something great.

24
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:36,900
Yeah. So you've all been many of you have been writing policy memos.

25
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,830
So SNAP benefits, which are state based programs.

26
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:48,690
Right. Where you have to demonstrate your eligibility, is that right?

27
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:54,540
Every six months. So some states have done that in Medicaid, for example.

28
00:03:54,540 --> 00:04:02,100
And think about the amount of work that is. And if you didn't demonstrate it at that six month, you might lose it even if you get it back again.

29
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:12,060
Just the consequences of that for particularly the people who need those benefits, but also for the state,

30
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:24,220
for spending, for administrative costs, very relevant to and similar to some things we've talked about.

31
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:35,390
Who else? Samir.

32
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:40,930
And then we'll go over there. Um.

33
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:47,470
So something I learned was the role of a pharmacy benefit manager, and it's not that I didn't know much about it,

34
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:54,940
it's that I didn't know anything about it and I didn't even know it existed. So everything about it was new information for me.

35
00:04:54,940 --> 00:05:07,960
OK, and what are the implications of pharmacy benefits managers, for example, in thinking about cost spending price?

36
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:12,630
Negotiating rebates, drug discounts for the big ones I can think of.

37
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:26,140
OK, so they're actually negotiating discounts and rebates for beneficiaries who are covered under the plans that they work for,

38
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:35,230
but also think about the role of that in the complexity of pharmaceutical.

39
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:39,570
Pricing. Right in the administrative costs.

40
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:54,500
So that's an example in the recorded lecture about the complexity of payments and the process of payments and prices for pharmaceuticals.

41
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:58,310
Something that I've just been thinking about since doing the international comparison, I say,

42
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:04,820
is like administrative efficiency and that's impact and that impact on quality of health and health care and how in the

43
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:11,690
US there's so much time being spent on waiting for insurance to come in and approval and doing paperwork and billing,

44
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:15,800
that that's delaying care and medications that could be helping somebody out.

45
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,800
OK, so administrative costs, in fact,

46
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:28,790
all of these comments have something to do with the administrative complexity in the US and the consequences of that for the for the people,

47
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:36,530
for the providers and ultimately for all of us in how much it costs.

48
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:40,100
Yeah, something I've been thinking about was in one of the readings,

49
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:47,120
it talked about how one of the main issues to moving to changing our paying system is getting

50
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:53,480
physicians and other people to think about the general public rather than just individual cases,

51
00:06:53,480 --> 00:07:04,400
which sounds a lot easier in practice and in working in a classroom or even for a health economist or something.

52
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:13,810
But an individual physician, you don't want to do that because your patient could get harmed or die or not get the treatment they need.

53
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:24,140
Yeah, so. Right. How to get providers to think about not just the individual patient in front of them right now,

54
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:30,230
but also to think about populations, the population, health.

55
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:38,390
So the idea is not to say that physicians should not be thinking about the patient who's right in front of them.

56
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:44,270
Right. So it's not to potentially harm any patient.

57
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:54,920
And of course, physicians, like all clinicians, are trained specifically to treat the patient in front of them.

58
00:07:54,920 --> 00:08:00,140
That's the focus of all of the training.

59
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:12,050
So recognizing the role of the connection between care and treatment of individual patients to the population and thinking

60
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:19,280
about what are the needs of a population and how that might influence not just the needs of the individual patient,

61
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:24,110
but how we organize and deliver care.

62
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:29,930
That's the goal. And in fact, it's perfect Segway to what we're going to be talking about today.

63
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:41,540
But I think I wouldn't say it's it's not to say to physicians you should no longer be thinking about the patient in front of you.

64
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:51,890
That doesn't change. But it's to recognize that those patients in front of you are connected to populations.

65
00:08:51,890 --> 00:09:01,670
And if we don't think about that at some level in the health care system, we end up with a health care system like ours.

66
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:16,760
Right. That's so how do we build that population focus into the delivery of care in various ways and value based payments are some of those ways.

67
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:27,270
So I'm going to actually take that as our cue to just dig right in.

68
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:46,000
To saying instead of the way we have been paying for health care, which is what's the default, historic traditional method of payment in health care?

69
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,800
What do we call it? Fee for service.

70
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:58,850
So let's try to pay for quality, not just the delivery of the service,

71
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:06,020
but to consider the quality of the service, not just the fact that something was delivered right.

72
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:11,570
That you had a visit, that a test was done, that there was a hospital stay.

73
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:17,750
But what was the quality of that care? So what do we mean by quality?

74
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:21,140
I'm going to give you a couple different definitions.

75
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:31,880
In some ways, a classic one is making sure the right patient receives the right service at the right time, in the right place by the right provider.

76
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:38,000
And this is similar to looking at Touba. Right. And nurses know the five rights we talk.

77
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:45,260
You talk about that for delivery of medications at the bedside, for example.

78
00:10:45,260 --> 00:11:00,210
So making sure the right treatment for the right patient at the right time by the right provider.

79
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:08,700
All right, you also have to know the name of a virus, Donna Abedian, which is a hard name to know.

80
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:16,410
And the reason you have to know this is because he is he is now like the grandfather of great grandfather,

81
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:25,080
I don't know of quality, the quality movement in health and health care, in medicine.

82
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:29,130
And he was a faculty member, an MP for his career.

83
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:39,690
So and you will still hear people talk about the diabetes and model of care of quality of care.

84
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:48,660
And for Don Abedian, he was we now take this sort of model so for granted.

85
00:11:48,660 --> 00:12:00,400
But he was saying that quality is the degree to which health care improves important patient outcomes.

86
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:06,930
That's not surprising, the health care should improve patient outcomes.

87
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:15,300
But he said it's the causal linkages among the structural conditions of the health care setting,

88
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:21,910
the process, conditions and environment of the health care delivery.

89
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:27,550
That is relevant to the outcomes that we see.

90
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:38,530
So he was you know, when we think about the process, the actual clinical practices and interventions that go in here, you know,

91
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:50,620
he included everything from the technical aspects of that care, as well as the interpersonal relational aspects of care.

92
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:59,260
We are still talking about all of those issues in various ways next semester when you take.

93
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:11,350
Professor Ryan's class, you're going to be digging into quality improvement processes and the policies related to that in much more depth,

94
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:21,450
and you'll see that these broad themes are still the focus of much of the the research.

95
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:31,900
You might also have heard about the Institute of Medicine's crossing the quality chasm, this is now 20 years old.

96
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:39,160
Essentially, it came out in 2001, but they identified six domains.

97
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:45,820
That are both those structural and process characteristics.

98
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:54,590
Each of these makes a lot of sense, right, safe care, effective care.

99
00:13:54,590 --> 00:14:07,700
Patient centered care, how much is the patient involved, engaged, understanding what their care is and how to participate in it?

100
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:19,550
Timely, equitable. And efficient, and we've been talking a little bit about the ways that our system is not efficient,

101
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:28,280
we're going we've we've obviously looked at a lot of the equity issues around financing and insurance.

102
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:35,600
And after a break and after the quiz, we'll be talking a lot more about equity.

103
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:44,000
So Don Abedian is a model of quality I OEM's six domains are a model of quality.

104
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:54,310
And just another phrase and term that some of you are probably familiar with or you may have heard of before, is what's called the triple aim.

105
00:14:54,310 --> 00:15:00,170
For quality. Which is.

106
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:07,370
Improving the patient experience, which is their outcomes, as well as that patient centered nurse,

107
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:18,560
improving the health of populations overall and reducing the cost of care or making care more efficient.

108
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:26,600
And just in the past five years, the triple aim has become a quadruple aim.

109
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:30,760
I'm going to show you in just a sec.

110
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:43,380
So this is the triple aim is a model coming out of Don Berwick is a name that some of you probably know and is associated with the triple aim.

111
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:54,740
The aim has all the three previous ones, and the fourth that is added is the clinician experience.

112
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:59,930
This was have actually been in discussion since about twenty fifteen.

113
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:09,240
And and part of the driver of thinking about the clinician experience has a lot to do with health I.T.

114
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:21,920
And the demands of electronic health records and other I.T. introduced into health care, into the delivery and care processes that.

115
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:37,550
Added lots of time, lots of extra work on to clinicians that wasn't really being paid for by any of the payers that disrupted their workflows,

116
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:44,630
that required for them not just time, but all kinds of new resources.

117
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:49,130
And the quadruple aim you will also hear discussed now during covid,

118
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:54,350
when we think about you've probably heard about the burnout that lots of clinicians

119
00:16:54,350 --> 00:17:01,610
are experiencing given the demands of health care delivery during covid.

120
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:11,540
So you're not going to have high quality care if the clinicians involved in that care are all completely burned out,

121
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:21,480
don't have time to engage with patients, to deliver patient centered care, et cetera.

122
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:30,540
OK, so three different sort of broad models of quality that you will potentially hear about.

123
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:43,460
OK. So now we're going to this is a bit of a fourth one, thinking about value based payment, so it's not just about quality.

124
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:57,350
It's saying to all the payment models that we've talked about last week, how do we introduce quality into those models or into those discussions?

125
00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:06,170
It stems from the fact that we know we spend, you know, what we looked at, it's it's well over the two point six trillion, right?

126
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:14,950
We spend more than everyone. We spend a lot we have a ton of waste in our health care system.

127
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:29,140
And some of that waste is because it is delivering unnecessary care or inefficient care, meaning care delivered.

128
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:34,810
We talked about this a number of times. People who say, for example, don't have insurance.

129
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:41,980
So they go to an emergency room for nonurgent or non-emergency care.

130
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:46,360
They need care, they're sick, they're hurt.

131
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:55,660
But they're going to the most expensive place to get that care because they have no access to any other kind of care.

132
00:18:55,660 --> 00:19:10,090
That's highly inefficient. Right. We're spending a lot to deliver care in in ways that we we should be using other methods.

133
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:18,970
So this these slides are from the Value-Based Insurance Design Center here at the University of Michigan,

134
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:24,850
which has been a key source of considering Value-Based Payment.

135
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:30,520
So what are some of the sources of low value care?

136
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:41,250
Sometimes it's doctors motivated by fee for service as well as a is a belief that more must be better.

137
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:50,520
Probably lots of you might have that right, it feels like, well, you know, compared to doing nothing,

138
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:58,420
doing something must always be better in health care, getting the test, getting the treatment.

139
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:10,130
That must always be better, and when we think about patient outcomes, the ultimate goal of better patient outcomes for quality.

140
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:18,560
Just doing another test, another treatment, another intervention is not necessarily the best,

141
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:24,800
but that's a really hard challenge for both providers and patients.

142
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:32,730
There are information disparities between providers and patients, what anybody?

143
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:38,200
What does that mean? Some of the readings have talked about that.

144
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:49,960
What do we mean by information? You know, differences between the provider and the patient.

145
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:58,330
And why might that be associated with low value care? Spencer.

146
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:02,850
I could say something based on MRI and.

147
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:15,260
They might not really need an MRI, but they're. OK, right, as a patient, do we know what we need for health care,

148
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:23,750
even even physicians who are as patients don't always know exactly what it is that they need.

149
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:33,470
We have to rely on the providers to tell us what we need at the most extreme.

150
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:42,240
Think about that. What if the car company determined and told you what kind of car you needed?

151
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:47,440
Right. That would seem to be problematic, right?

152
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:57,420
Now, that doesn't mean that physicians and providers are trying to, you know, provide a lot of unnecessary care.

153
00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:04,230
But there is evidence and in some of the Moriarty's readings, if you've if you've gotten to them,

154
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:16,770
talk about a number of studies that show when the doctors, for example, own the MRI machine in their practice, they do a lot more MRI eyes.

155
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:31,020
And it it has as much to do with bullet number one as it does to do with bullets two, three and four.

156
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:40,610
So if we have an MRI machine just down the hall. And I'm evaluating this patient as a physician.

157
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:45,710
And there's a little uncertainty about what this might be.

158
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:58,570
Maybe it's just easier to do the MRI. To not consider the consequences of that, to not for cost, but also for quality,

159
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:07,480
for outcomes for the patient, for the implications for others who might need access to the MRI.

160
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:15,550
All of those things might might be influencing a provider to say, yeah, you need the MRI,

161
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:22,840
privately insured patients who have good insurance are unlikely to say, wait a minute, is that really necessary?

162
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,610
How much does that cost?

163
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:34,460
And in fact, you'll read a little bit about that as well, that even when we do provide patients with information about differences in costs.

164
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:40,650
For the MRI in the doctor's office versus and another lab.

165
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:44,790
A couple of miles away, that's providing an MRI.

166
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:55,740
Most patients don't necessarily just go to the other one with the lower cost, even if it's a lower out of pocket cost to them.

167
00:23:55,740 --> 00:24:03,200
From private insurance because their doctor said, we can do the MRI for you right here.

168
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:09,560
I generally trust my doctor. I'm much more likely to just do that, right,

169
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:21,990
so those information asymmetries between providers and patients operate and connect to all of these other factors as well.

170
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:29,490
Sometimes providers might be concerned about I'm not sure what this is, I don't want a patient to sue me.

171
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:37,530
If it turns out that this is something big, I'm going to, by default, do the test even if I don't think it's necessary.

172
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:43,170
And there is some evidence that about 10 to 15 percent of all of that waste,

173
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:58,360
those unnecessary that unnecessary care is related to concerns about medical malpractise suits.

174
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:07,920
From patients. And then, of course, just the incentive of the provider doesn't get paid.

175
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:28,470
Or it gets paid more when they do more stuff, when they, you know, deliver more tests, procedures, et cetera.

176
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:39,570
So the challenge of thinking about that big circle of low value care, though, is that it's not just, well, MRI's are low value care.

177
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:48,390
That's clearly not true. It's the conditions under which the MRI is delivered.

178
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:57,120
So the clinical benefit might be really high for one patient, but not so for another patient.

179
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:09,200
And determining the difference is a real challenge. It's further complicated by the fact that it's not just differences.

180
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:19,670
Across patients. Right, who receives it, it's also differences across who is providing it.

181
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:27,530
And where it's provided. So the same EKG.

182
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:37,040
Provided in the E.R. to that uninsured patient who walks into the E.R. with some they've been having some heart pain,

183
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:50,170
for example, is really expensive. But that same EKG that's provided in a primary care office.

184
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:59,840
Might be absolutely high quality, the right service at the right time for the right patient in the right place.

185
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:10,320
So all of these complexities are really a challenge for thinking about high value and low value care and payment models.

186
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:20,660
About quality are trying to consider some of these factors.

187
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:40,630
Anybody have questions about that? Spencer, what's it like to work with like you really, really about your family?

188
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:48,540
Providers here to tell. They're like they're more likely to have.

189
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:52,950
They know that, but I think, yes, say that again,

190
00:27:52,950 --> 00:28:10,290
like the patient is really concerned that we're dealing with with the virus or may maybe unnecessary, but.

191
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:21,720
So there is there is evidence of exactly that related to especially related to and you all may have experienced this yourself,

192
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:27,220
the prescription of antibiotics, for example. Right.

193
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:36,970
You have or I have a respiratory infection that is really going to resolve it's a you know,

194
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:44,380
a rhino virus or something, it's not a a bacterial infection.

195
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:49,000
It's something it's a virus. Antibiotics don't treat viruses.

196
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:55,960
Right. But I know that if I get that prescription from the doctor, it's going to I'm going to feel better, quicker.

197
00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:01,980
It's going to go away faster. Right. So I'm going to go to the doctor.

198
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:09,480
Doctors going to check and I don't have strep, I don't have I don't have any treatable thing,

199
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:18,360
I just have a respiratory infection, probably viral, go home, rest, drink lots of fluids, take some Tylenol.

200
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:26,550
You'll feel better in six to 10 days. Patients do not like to hear that or think about it,

201
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:40,500
it's for your two year old who has an ear infection that is also just viral and this two year old is not sleeping at all because their ear hurts.

202
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:44,820
Those parents do not want to hear. This is a viral infection.

203
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:50,400
You can give some Tylenol, but it'll resolve in six to 10 days.

204
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:56,310
Right. They want antibiotics. And that is a really hard challenge.

205
00:29:56,310 --> 00:30:03,140
Clinicians have historically prescribed antibiotics.

206
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:11,930
There's been a large push because that's problematic in lots of ways, it's unnecessary care, it's costly.

207
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:16,190
Antibiotics are not so expensive, but there is some cost to it.

208
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:26,480
But there's also a longer term, larger implications of becoming resistance to antibiotics, increasing resistance to antibiotics.

209
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:33,830
So lots of quality push to get physicians to resist patient demands.

210
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:41,760
But that's really hard because here's this patient, this one patient, like no point in your office.

211
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:47,670
You know, begging you for antibiotics for the two year old or for themselves,

212
00:30:47,670 --> 00:31:03,780
so in that it's not so easy that the the physician is trying to to support the patient in what they want, even when it's not the right thing.

213
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:08,430
There's also some evidence where we can think about more serious health conditions,

214
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:12,960
but where there are trade offs in different kinds of treatment options,

215
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:22,740
that might be equivalent in quality outcomes, but depend on what it is that how it fits with the patient values.

216
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:34,860
So for prostate cancer, for example, identifying early prostate cancer is not usually an urgent or emergent cancer.

217
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:45,540
It's a slow growing cancer. In most cases, there is no need to treat and certainly no need to treat right away.

218
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:54,270
But there are some cases that are fast growing and deadly, so you've got this uncertainty, right?

219
00:31:54,270 --> 00:32:02,950
Patients can choose to wait and monitor the situation before doing any treatment.

220
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:19,450
They can choose to have radiation therapy, they can choose to have surgery, all have trade offs of side effects, cost, benefits and consequences.

221
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:32,050
And there's lots of evidence that which kind of doctor you see determines what happens rather than what the patient actually wants.

222
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:35,920
So if you see a urologist who's a surgeon.

223
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:45,640
You get surgery, if you see a urologist who's in a practice multi specialty practice, you probably get recommended to radiation therapy.

224
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:50,710
If you see your family medicine or internal medicine, primary care doctor,

225
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:56,860
you're more likely to do watchful waiting, at least for some amount of time before you get referred.

226
00:32:56,860 --> 00:33:03,970
So there that's the flip side. It's not taking into account the patient's wishes necessarily.

227
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:10,780
So those kind of things about like how does this work between what the patient wants and how that might influence,

228
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:27,990
whether the provider influences, whether the provider pushes a patient to a particular kind of service or treatment kind of depends.

229
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:45,230
OK. So. The IOM also makes some recommendations for ways that we can get to quality by addressing

230
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:56,360
some of the the drivers of pricing and payment to reduce waste and low value care.

231
00:33:56,360 --> 00:34:05,240
So. Value-Based Payment is trying to realign the incentives for high value care.

232
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:20,080
So and it's basically addressing exactly those issues of what the treatment is that's covered, who delivers it?

233
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:36,480
Um. How it's paid to some extent and why this then matters for improving quality.

234
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:46,890
So value based payments are alternative models that are trying to realign the financial incentives around.

235
00:34:46,890 --> 00:34:56,490
Who delivers care, what care is delivered, how it's paid in order to improve quality so value based payments,

236
00:34:56,490 --> 00:35:05,340
alternative payment bottles, value based contracting, value based purchasing, you've probably heard all of these terms.

237
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:12,380
These are all interchangeable terms for alternative payment models, value based payments.

238
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:27,850
So one of these is pay for performance. I'm sure many of you have heard of it's a variation of fee for service.

239
00:35:27,850 --> 00:35:35,510
It is basically still paying a fee for service.

240
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:53,160
But the services are evaluated as to whether this is a high value, high quality service or a low value service, and if so, it's paid less.

241
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:59,160
And some of what determines is that a low value or high value are just those factors we looked at.

242
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:08,920
Where is it delivered? When is it delivered? Who is it delivered to?

243
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:19,940
Another form of value based payments are risk sharing models, so these have become much more prevalent over just the past few years.

244
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:34,350
You've probably heard of all of these. So risk sharing means that the provider shares some of the risk with the payer.

245
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:52,130
At the at the what does this mean, risk everybody understand what this means to to share the risk?

246
00:36:52,130 --> 00:37:00,960
Yes. The.

247
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:06,330
Accountability for the consequences of not doing this and.

248
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:18,450
OK, the consequence of taking certain action or not taking action, so the risk here is if the patient is healthy.

249
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:26,390
They don't need as much health care services and the payment is the payer doesn't have to pay out a lot.

250
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:31,480
If they're sicker or need more care.

251
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:40,370
The payer has to pay out more. So in some ways, there's that mixed incentive for the provider.

252
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:50,560
It's not just we've talked about that those mixed incentives for physicians related to fee for service, the more I do, the more I get paid.

253
00:37:50,560 --> 00:38:00,650
This is a little bit different. If I as the provider, can ensure that you are healthier.

254
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:07,810
You're not in my office, you're not in my hospital, you don't need tests or treatment.

255
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:13,330
I don't get paid. That's good for the pair.

256
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:20,210
That's not so good for the provider. So trying to.

257
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:31,120
Provide the highest quality care that might keep patients healthy, make them have better outcomes, keep them healthy.

258
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:41,780
Treat them quickly and well. Means payer or providers don't get paid.

259
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:53,180
But payers are happy about that. So getting the provider to share in the risk if I keep my patients.

260
00:38:53,180 --> 00:39:00,260
Healthy if I deliver the highest quality, high value care.

261
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:08,190
I'm going to under fee for service, I get less, paid less. But under Value-Based Care.

262
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:17,180
Risk sharing models. The savings that the OR sees.

263
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:25,430
End up coming back to me, the physician, the provider, the hospital.

264
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:40,870
OK. Most of the models have been shared savings as we keep patients healthier.

265
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:50,050
You do the screening test so they don't come back later with the full blown disease or illness.

266
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:59,500
You get paid more. At the provider rather than so you don't lose the.

267
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:08,040
The payment that you would get when they end up back in your office or in the hospital.

268
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:16,860
A classic example or model that is used for these is you had a heart attack, you come into our hospital,

269
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:25,770
you get treated Kabbage, you might even get paid for a similar to what the drug for Medicare pays private insurance.

270
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:30,600
You know, you're a little bit above that. We release you within 30 days.

271
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:35,130
You're back in the hospital. We released you a little bit too early.

272
00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:39,810
We didn't make sure that you were healthy enough to go home.

273
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:56,350
We didn't make sure that in your home you had the necessary support for somebody who's just released after coronary bypass surgery.

274
00:40:56,350 --> 00:41:04,340
You, as the hospital, get to charge more, right, you're back in the hospital, we get to enter into a whole new.

275
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:10,220
Episode of Payment under fee for service.

276
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:23,530
Under risk sharing, the hospital is going to get penalized for the downside risk that you have patients coming back within 30 days after discharge.

277
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:32,150
High quality care is you might keep the patient one day longer in the hospital at the initial.

278
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:39,750
Stay. To ensure that they're healthy enough to go home, that they don't come back to the hospital,

279
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:57,730
so 30 day readmission is a measure of risk and health quality outcomes that indicate whether it is high quality care or low quality care.

280
00:41:57,730 --> 00:42:10,070
If the patient gets readmitted within 30 days, the payment from the payer will be lower to the provider because.

281
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:22,960
The outcome is worse. The providers who release all their patients, no 30 day readmission.

282
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:30,820
They're going to end up getting a higher payment under the shared savings because they

283
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:39,490
have kept the patients helped deliver high quality care that improved the outcomes,

284
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:46,610
kept the patients healthy. Tracking this data patient in the hospital.

285
00:42:46,610 --> 00:42:49,640
They've got to go get readmitted again. I could see some bias.

286
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:55,700
Well, maybe they don't like to get done if there's another possibility to go to another.

287
00:42:55,700 --> 00:43:03,020
So you really believe that?

288
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:07,920
Yeah, so these are payment bottles, it's a good question. These are payment models.

289
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:12,590
So this is being tracked by the payer, by the insurer.

290
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:22,820
And so that patient who gets released declines, has to go back in the hospital, might choose to go to a different hospital.

291
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:36,830
The first hospital is the one that's going to get dinged under the shared risk, the shared penalty, because it was their delivery of care.

292
00:43:36,830 --> 00:43:42,900
So this is, I know, a little bit complicated to understand.

293
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:55,890
It's so different from fee for service. Because it's about payment over time, Reeko, what are you doing here?

294
00:43:55,890 --> 00:44:13,670
I feel like I could see like. But outside of the.

295
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:18,570
Like my mother. Great question.

296
00:44:18,570 --> 00:44:26,890
What about provider's views of this? Well, in some ways they don't have a lot of choice necessarily.

297
00:44:26,890 --> 00:44:34,990
If the insurer says this is the model of payment we are offering to you, we're no longer going to pay a fee for service.

298
00:44:34,990 --> 00:44:47,080
Might be a reason. And that might depend on. The relation of, you know, how much competition is there for other providers,

299
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:53,320
if you're the monopoly provider in your community, the insurer can't really say that.

300
00:44:53,320 --> 00:45:03,520
But to the extent that there's more competition, more other providers in your area you might be faced with,

301
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:15,340
this is the only payment model you're going to get. Providers, though, also worry about so some providers treat patients who are a lot sicker.

302
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:23,330
Then other hospitals, right? Who is the patient population going to those hospitals?

303
00:45:23,330 --> 00:45:31,870
And so if I'm a hospital that treats really sick people, maybe a poor population.

304
00:45:31,870 --> 00:45:39,550
And to the extent that poorer populations have had less access to care, have worse health.

305
00:45:39,550 --> 00:45:45,570
Are going to be less likely to be able to go home after that surgery.

306
00:45:45,570 --> 00:45:57,710
They're going to say, wait a minute, we're always going to be on the downside here, so when you hear about risk adjustment models for payment.

307
00:45:57,710 --> 00:46:09,590
That's what the pair says will take into account, will adjust your risk model based on how sick your patient population is,

308
00:46:09,590 --> 00:46:21,010
and this is always a debate between the providers, the hospitals and doctors, too, and the payers.

309
00:46:21,010 --> 00:46:30,120
Arguing about, you know, how sick the patients really are.

310
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:40,560
How much adjustment needs to be made in order to get to the shared savings or shared risk?

311
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:51,220
So that's a really good question, you will get into that in a lot more detail next semester in Professor Ryan's Class six to.

312
00:46:51,220 --> 00:47:05,240
Because there are all kinds of ways then both providers and payers are trying to ensure that they get the better and of this these models.

313
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:22,890
Catherine. What do you think that was last year, then the.

314
00:47:22,890 --> 00:47:28,230
Wait, say that again. So for the parents.

315
00:47:28,230 --> 00:47:34,020
Over. They're.

316
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:43,370
Are costing. But in the long term, that is our.

317
00:47:43,370 --> 00:47:52,290
Negotiate lower. When they're paying for the insurance.

318
00:47:52,290 --> 00:47:58,560
So that's the key. We have a third party payer model, right?

319
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:07,840
We've got payers. We've got patients or purchasers, right?

320
00:48:07,840 --> 00:51:04,110
You've got both there and we have providers. OK.

321
00:51:04,110 --> 00:51:15,310
Right. Fee for service. You understand that that's still the majority of payment models in the US,

322
00:51:15,310 --> 00:51:23,500
although this slide is a couple of years old and that's shrinking fast fee for service linked to quality,

323
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:29,560
that's pay for performance, that's been growing, that's been around for a while.

324
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:39,700
Alternative payment models that are still trying to use some shared the shared savings models.

325
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:44,380
They're sort of still built on fee for service. You're kind of still getting paid that way.

326
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:52,310
But then you'll get a bonus of the shared savings. You'll get a penalty of the shared costs for that risk.

327
00:51:52,310 --> 00:51:58,070
The idea is to move to something more population based.

328
00:51:58,070 --> 00:52:29,270
And we're still not totally there, but I'm going to show you one of those live.

329
00:52:29,270 --> 00:52:40,130
He was going to receive. The problem is that we are.

330
00:52:40,130 --> 00:52:49,460
So it's the American health care system. There are always implications for equity and inequality, sadly,

331
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:56,390
just like there are always implications for cost and quality, which is always true in every health care system.

332
00:52:56,390 --> 00:53:07,160
OK. Providers who might be able to deliver higher quality care.

333
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:16,010
We'll end up with more potentially with more resources because of value based payments.

334
00:53:16,010 --> 00:53:21,470
Right, alternative payment models, they not only end up with healthier patients,

335
00:53:21,470 --> 00:53:32,960
they are going to end up getting paid more because they're delivering high quality care and value based payments reward high quality care.

336
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:43,620
To the extent that populations differ in access to providers of high quality care.

337
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:52,620
Right. That's going to have more the implications for inequality, like you're saying.

338
00:53:52,620 --> 00:53:54,750
We haven't really looked at that yet.

339
00:53:54,750 --> 00:54:04,350
We're going to be looking at that after break about we've been talking about inequality based on access to care through insurance,

340
00:54:04,350 --> 00:54:18,430
but where patients go, what kind of hospitals they access, what kind of doctors they have access to, of course, also varies.

341
00:54:18,430 --> 00:54:28,700
With poorer locations, communities of color, having generally less well resourced.

342
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:34,440
Lower quality. Care systems.

343
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:46,180
And to the extent that value based payments over time are going to reward already high quality providers.

344
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:53,790
That has definite implications for equity.

345
00:54:53,790 --> 00:55:05,790
So we'll be looking at some of that in a couple of weeks about what is the what are the providers that poorer people,

346
00:55:05,790 --> 00:55:16,980
that communities who have been excluded or limited in access to care, what what are the characteristics of those providers?

347
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:24,670
And can they deliver high quality care? Do they have the resources already to do that?

348
00:55:24,670 --> 00:55:32,200
And what are the implications then for value based payments? So.

349
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:38,420
Like I said, that is always the implication our system is not set up.

350
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:48,940
For efficient care, it's not set up for high quality care and it's not set up for equitable care.

351
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:56,980
Despite that being the, you know, part of the six domains.

352
00:55:56,980 --> 00:56:07,450
That Medicare value based payment models are all of these different acronyms here.

353
00:56:07,450 --> 00:56:17,950
You've probably heard some of them Macara MIPS ways of paying physicians, ways of paying providers, hospitals, etc.

354
00:56:17,950 --> 00:56:24,020
I'm not going to go you're not going to go through all of these, but like in typical fashion.

355
00:56:24,020 --> 00:56:30,200
You know, what do you read when you you just look at this, you don't know even what it means.

356
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:37,730
What are the implications for administrative efficiency and costs in US health care system?

357
00:56:37,730 --> 00:56:53,120
Right. That's what this slide is telling you. Two different models of payment models under the Macra that you should be a little bit familiar with.

358
00:56:53,120 --> 00:57:06,360
The quality payment program for physicians. And the how that is trying to.

359
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:15,050
Pay for quality for physician based care.

360
00:57:15,050 --> 00:57:28,970
To reward based on tracking quality of their patience, it rewarded it after the High Tech Act, which funded a lot of cars for physicians.

361
00:57:28,970 --> 00:57:40,220
The MIPS program is the continued way of trying to help fund the acquisition and use of each year in physician practices.

362
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:59,350
Mark. You did a lot of trouble.

363
00:57:59,350 --> 00:58:10,850
But. Yep, no decisions.

364
00:58:10,850 --> 00:58:23,640
Know. Especially where you're a.

365
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:35,740
Interesting. To qualify for.

366
00:58:35,740 --> 00:58:43,360
That's a great comment model is trying to introduce quality and payment.

367
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:49,060
It's so complicated, it's so administratively burdensome on the providers.

368
00:58:49,060 --> 00:58:54,640
They're not going to they don't want to do it. They can't do it.

369
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:58,980
They need to hire extra staff in order to do it.

370
00:58:58,980 --> 00:59:05,150
Costs, right? So the the.

371
00:59:05,150 --> 00:59:17,920
You know, back to these arguments about do we scrap the whole thing and start over or do we continue to try to tweak the system that we have or the,

372
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:19,800
you know, the way we do payment,

373
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:31,920
how these models are trying to take the system as we have it and change the payment model in order to introduce quality.

374
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:40,860
But they're also contributing to the inefficiency in some ways because of the administrative burden on providers.

375
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:48,900
This, I think, is they've actually been revising the MIPS program in the past two years,

376
00:59:48,900 --> 01:00:02,350
supposedly to try to simplify it a little bit, to get more, I think, physician groups to participate.

377
01:00:02,350 --> 01:00:13,920
How about accountable care organizations, people? You remember that term if you're not already familiar from the Affordable Care Act.

378
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:20,980
So. Accountable care organizations are groups of providers, physician groups,

379
01:00:20,980 --> 01:00:27,160
hospitals, other kinds of health providers might be skilled nursing facilities,

380
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:33,370
rehab hospitals, cetera, who decide to join something,

381
01:00:33,370 --> 01:00:45,720
come together in what's called an accountable care organization to coordinate care to deliver high quality care.

382
01:00:45,720 --> 01:01:00,050
To do exactly that, to not just coordinate, to have high quality care, but to reduce unnecessary care, to reduce fragmented care.

383
01:01:00,050 --> 01:01:04,970
Across different providers and reduce errors.

384
01:01:04,970 --> 01:01:18,020
So both accountable care organizations started out right after the ACA with the shared savings only they only had what is called upside risk.

385
01:01:18,020 --> 01:01:30,080
They would only benefit. When they were evaluated as having delivered high quality care, they would get some of those savings back.

386
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:44,470
After a number of years of that, the downside risk, the penalty for low value care, was introduced into accountable care organizations.

387
01:01:44,470 --> 01:02:01,540
So the goals of accountable care organizations are. Back to the point we started that Noah made to think about the health of the population.

388
01:02:01,540 --> 01:02:12,910
That the Accountable Care Organization is delivering care for, whether that's a regional group, whether it is a specific patient population,

389
01:02:12,910 --> 01:02:26,600
some accountable care organizations are related to specific disease categories like kidney failure.

390
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:40,230
For example, so having the provider recognize that they are part of a system of care, multiple providers, not just themselves.

391
01:02:40,230 --> 01:02:56,110
Who are trying to who need to kind of work together and coordinate to make sure that there's high quality care delivered and good outcomes.

392
01:02:56,110 --> 01:03:07,000
And ultimately, the goal here is to go from this, where we we have few models and few providers out here delivering,

393
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:12,080
you know, in accountable care organizations where they really are.

394
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:19,220
Getting rewarded or paying attention to population health,

395
01:03:19,220 --> 01:03:40,380
as well as the individual patient health and moving to where that's the majority of the payment models, Reiko.

396
01:03:40,380 --> 01:03:53,460
So one of the categories up here is an integrated finance and delivery system and an HMO is an example of an integrated finance and delivery system.

397
01:03:53,460 --> 01:04:00,870
Right. And HMO. So accountable care organizations.

398
01:04:00,870 --> 01:04:10,470
Are really just coordinated care among providers, so lots of different types of providers,

399
01:04:10,470 --> 01:04:17,190
doctors offices, hospitals who are integrating and those are called integrated delivery systems.

400
01:04:17,190 --> 01:04:30,810
Sometimes we know Intermountain is a big integrated delivery system group health in Seattle, actually, group health is an HMO.

401
01:04:30,810 --> 01:04:35,610
So an HMO. This is where ACOs are.

402
01:04:35,610 --> 01:04:48,830
You know, you get the hospital, you get physicians. You've got skilled nursing facilities, you might have labs, right?

403
01:04:48,830 --> 01:04:57,270
That is when those are all working together in and that's an accountable care organization, fully integrated HMO.

404
01:04:57,270 --> 01:05:04,280
Those are connections among providers and payers.

405
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:15,220
And in fact, they're the same. So Kaiser is a classic integrated finance and delivery system.

406
01:05:15,220 --> 01:05:22,600
The provider is the payer, the payer is the provider.

407
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:34,930
So group Health of Puget Sound is also a essentially an HMO Kaiser isn't called an HMO, but it is that integrated.

408
01:05:34,930 --> 01:05:45,580
So instead of having to incentivize the providers to think about quality because they're integrated, they're already.

409
01:05:45,580 --> 01:05:47,650
Thinking about it.

410
01:05:47,650 --> 01:06:05,080
So lots of evidence of why Cayzer delivers really high quality care at lower cost than lots of other health systems across the country.

411
01:06:05,080 --> 01:06:13,900
Because they are interconnected, we're going to look at some of those integrated delivery systems and how they operate a little bit later,

412
01:06:13,900 --> 01:06:25,380
but they're already sharing risk. They're already remember what are the payment models of HMOs?

413
01:06:25,380 --> 01:06:33,480
They're more likely to be capitation. Providers are being paid capitation or salary.

414
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:42,090
Or budget models, the the annual budget for the hospitals.

415
01:06:42,090 --> 01:06:51,980
So they're using different payment structures than fee for service.

416
01:06:51,980 --> 01:07:01,040
And I was just going to end with this table from Moriarty's at all one of the texts

417
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:09,240
where they're sort of talking about all of these different barriers to quality.

418
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:15,600
And changing payment. Is.

419
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:27,370
Might address a few of these barriers to quality, but there are still other barriers to quality that aren't just about the payment models.

420
01:07:27,370 --> 01:07:37,110
But what we've been looking at is payment related to quality.

421
01:07:37,110 --> 01:07:41,220
You'll notice, too, that none of these are really about, you know,

422
01:07:41,220 --> 01:07:53,630
we started this sort of whole unit last week talking about expenditures and how the US spends more than every other country.

423
01:07:53,630 --> 01:08:04,910
None of these are really about spending less. It's possible that they will spend less, but really the goal is to at least get the value,

424
01:08:04,910 --> 01:08:23,820
get the quality related to how much we spend because we looked at we spend more, and yet our quality is not necessarily what we should expect.

425
01:08:23,820 --> 01:08:50,950
Any of these surprise you? Confuse you?

426
01:08:50,950 --> 01:08:58,230
I think will let you just. Think about those.

427
01:08:58,230 --> 01:09:08,340
And on Thursday, we're going to kind of wrap up talking about payment and pricing and you'll be meeting with your bird teams,

428
01:09:08,340 --> 01:09:13,930
a few people said, but I really like my mountain team. You will you will meet with your mountain team again.

429
01:09:13,930 --> 01:09:22,740
It doesn't mean like you're done forever with your mountain team, but it's just sort of a reshuffle and you'll be meeting with your bird teams.

430
01:09:22,740 --> 01:09:25,020
You're where I think we're going to just do it in here.

431
01:09:25,020 --> 01:09:32,610
It's just a discussion about some of these issues and what are the implications of them that we're going

432
01:09:32,610 --> 01:09:39,630
to do a little bit more discussion of prices and then you'll talk in your bird teams on Thursday,

433
01:09:39,630 --> 01:10:04,976
OK?
