1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:17,880
Today's topic is about selecting a research project on research meant to be a tool to be able to select both the research project and the mentor.

2
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,620
First, we need to ask ourselves why we do want to do research?

3
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:28,170
Why are. Yes.

4
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:40,680
Keep trying to do research. Trying to answer some questions about a topic that we.

5
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:47,570
No more than can anyone tell me. You know what you are studying about Robert.

6
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:51,899
Why do you want to do research? Well, what do you feel about research?

7
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:55,200
That you feel attractive and you want to do? Anyone?

8
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:02,340
Wow. Hmm. Um, I've been working.

9
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:11,930
So we've had to resort to revenge in.

10
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:17,490
She said they were just doing things but making no difference.

11
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:24,470
If you're patient, but do a bunch of stuff but no help at all.

12
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:31,460
So after I heard that, I'm like, I would like to see that I can help.

13
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,840
You want to help? Yeah. You want to get. Well, that's.

14
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:41,590
That's an excellent reason. Well, they're improving, pal.

15
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:48,130
They're. Well. So our interesting doings.

16
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:59,820
If you write down intellectual curiosity to try to, ah, to know something new,

17
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:13,020
I eve I always tell my students that when you are working in a particular project, there is a moment when you find something new.

18
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:18,990
In that very precise moment, you know, something that no one else in the world.

19
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:25,410
For me. It's wonderful. Right.

20
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:31,550
And then helping lower their intellectual curiosity.

21
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:47,280
Any other reason why you want to do research? Yeah.

22
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:52,820
Or Association Mechanism services or. Yeah.

23
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:58,280
Link in to help. You know, there is prevention and there are different reasons why we want to do research.

24
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:10,050
Um, then after we want to do research, then the next question is what type of research they want to do, why particular focus they want to,

25
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:22,340
to to pursue what questions are interested them here in your time in the um I your idea

26
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:30,330
studies or your women's studies you need to choose both a research project and a mentor.

27
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:38,750
Most likely they are going to be link. I mean that jury selection.

28
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:49,010
Because how do you proceed in this situation that you need to do?

29
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:53,650
You say, I want to work in a particular project and you look for a mentor,

30
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:58,730
the one that did that project, or rather you say, I want to work with this particular person.

31
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:06,350
Then what is more important for you, this or or that research, let's say?

32
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:28,460
Both have their ways. Mm hmm. I mean. Yeah.

33
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:41,670
4 to 5 years without a visa like. Yeah.

34
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:50,740
Yeah, that's true. So how your mentor has to be.

35
00:04:52,830 --> 00:05:01,950
And your mentary is, uh, b is more than a simple advisor because an advisor is telling you, for example,

36
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:06,570
you need to take these classes or maybe you don't need to take these classes this semester,

37
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:11,100
but your mentor has some embezzlement in your success,

38
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:20,700
has embezzlement that you you will use these and you are going to be susceptible either as opposed door or you are them.

39
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:27,150
As students, I want to continue with a doctoral student that has been doing, I would say, an emotional investment in your success.

40
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:34,309
Okay. Yeah.

41
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:45,430
Let me explain a little bit. No, exactly. Because here, when you start, you your ms. or your impatience, uh.

42
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:53,429
We assigned to do another base or what we call an academic advisor, but that academic advisor,

43
00:05:53,430 --> 00:06:01,710
usually you only see that person one semester or twice a semester, usually maybe during orientation day.

44
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:07,110
Then does that narrow law or the advisors?

45
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:13,800
The advisors will have to take care of making sure that you are following the schedule of your classes.

46
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:23,250
Now for MPH student because you are not doing that thesis, then you don't have a mentor, research mentor.

47
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:32,100
Now for me, students are usually the basis for fundamental can be to different person,

48
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:41,210
but we recommend to be the same person because your mentor, Pew Research Center, is going to guide you to your thesis.

49
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:47,960
So who is the person? Oh, my.

50
00:06:51,830 --> 00:07:00,649
Adviser. My adviser told me I need to find some money so my activity would help that

51
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:07,850
person with his or her project where that he would have her raise the money.

52
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:12,170
So basically I am contributing with my activity.

53
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:16,220
So finding pieces to helping that professor.

54
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:24,590
Yes. Let's say you want that person yet. Let's say you are interested in doing a Ph.D. after you finish your masters degree.

55
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,640
Now, how that works, you will need to.

56
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,930
What was it in this university? You decide to continue VR or even on a later university.

57
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:41,040
You want to go to university and talk with that person?

58
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:44,980
Who is that person? That would be a mental.

59
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:52,000
That would be. I mean, exactly. Then you need to talk with that person and see whether the research that he or she is doing.

60
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:53,930
You sort of your interest.

61
00:07:53,960 --> 00:08:05,890
Also, you've met you're a potential mentor, has to see whether you are someone that can work with him or her now for PTSD as to this,

62
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:11,830
because that which only is covered by your mentor through research grants.

63
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:22,540
Yeah. Then also that there is other consideration to take into account for example with our particular

64
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:29,499
mentor has funding to go to to cover your studies because that's how this work your,

65
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:32,650
your mentor is going to cover due to each allowing you to spend this year.

66
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:45,260
Well when you are doing your peers these tools. Now, now, right now for mentor.

67
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:52,010
Uh, what I'm referring here is the research mentor that is going to guide you through your pieces.

68
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:58,360
Now. What? What are you looking at? Okay, then.

69
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:02,660
So what? You told me that you are. You first look into that man.

70
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:08,830
Then what were you looking them into? I mean, how do you say this is a good person to do that with?

71
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,820
Yes. Like all the ones that you think would be a good fit. Yep.

72
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:24,060
And how do you select at the end? Say you meet with, I don't know, all the faculty here in the department.

73
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:33,070
Material House, whichever one you think you kind of feel the best.

74
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:37,550
I guess we probably. Interest in the project.

75
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:41,270
Yeah. Alignment of interests. Mm hmm. I mean, something.

76
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:47,890
Well which I. It happened by coincidence.

77
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:56,120
Mhm. So. But Micromax ready to take initiatives.

78
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:01,830
The center is different teaching styles, so it depends on what you want.

79
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:10,420
Stuff and fix the stuff that you did wrong.

80
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:22,950
Yeah, that's exactly. I think that's very important because when you are looking for mentors,

81
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:29,400
your mentor is going to an interview, some kind of formal or informal interview,

82
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:38,880
but also you will need to interview your mentor, your potential mentor, because that is going to depend on your style.

83
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:45,930
Are you up person that wants to meet with your mentor once a week or once a month?

84
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:51,959
You are the type of student that you like more to work independently and just to

85
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:57,360
meet with your mentor once in a while to see that the progress of your research,

86
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:03,610
uh, also in that you will need to take into account even the,

87
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:09,570
the rank of your mentor because let's say the rank, academic rank,

88
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:17,340
whether it is a full professor or associate professor or assistant professor because they had differing availability.

89
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:22,000
Usually full professors are in meeting. They are traveling.

90
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,590
I remember my mentor. He usually was out of the country happy.

91
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:36,460
Then I remembered I met with her usefully one at the beginning of the semester while not being on that semester.

92
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,080
With everything going,

93
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:48,640
I would think William phone number was very stylish and also I feel comfortable with that style and that's important you need to feel.

94
00:11:49,070 --> 00:12:03,040
I would do that now. You are the type of student that you want more our guide process, like the one looking for you in a more routine basis.

95
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:08,620
Then maybe you need to look for someone, maybe, you know in the rank of full professor or maybe an associate, an assistant.

96
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:15,430
But again, that's a lot that type of thing that you need to talk with your mentor, your potential mentor.

97
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:23,649
Now, then those are some aspects that you need that you need to take into account.

98
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:33,010
When selecting a mentor, very useful is going to be a long term relationship because you are a student,

99
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:38,950
are going to define use, your mentor is going to write the letter of the recommendation, look for you.

100
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,610
Most likely you are going to do some research together.

101
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,990
You are going to publish paper together even for master's.

102
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:49,510
If you decide to continue in a Ph.D.,

103
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:57,220
you can decide to do it work with as a mentor or with a different mentor to edit with the same group of researchers.

104
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,950
Then these are long term relationship.

105
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:07,990
Then that's one thing that you need to take into account when selecting a mentor you are going to have interaction did for two years.

106
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:17,620
The other method is what plugins and again that is recommendations and your mentor is going to have a major impact in your success,

107
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:25,870
your career trajectory, etc. then don't think only about that short term objective of getting this done.

108
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:34,070
I mean, it's important that you need to you need to finish your. But please try to look beyond that.

109
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:42,900
We're still so far. I was on time.

110
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:48,100
Yes. Serendipity, I. Yeah.

111
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:56,670
That's how I was applying to I was in Costa Rica, I was working at the University of Costa Rica then um,

112
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:04,700
i.e. I applied for down for the de Bruin Valley was trying to at that moment to pick to the

113
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:10,409
University of Texas in Houston because they had a very nice program in population genetics.

114
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:14,040
That was my interest at the moment. Then apply.

115
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,790
I got accepted and applied for the fellowship.

116
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:24,480
I don't you know, this fellowship, the Fulbright Fellowship through the U.S. Embassy, but.

117
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:30,820
I was rejected. Most people who were rejected and I didn't have any funding.

118
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:34,870
Then I think, okay, what I'm going to do now, I was looking for options.

119
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:43,009
Then I was working out at the University of Costa Rica and there is an Institute of Health in Costa Rica.

120
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:46,720
And they were, I think, the 30 year anniversary.

121
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:52,490
The first person from from Harvard to do photog.

122
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:57,220
Then I talked with him. He's from Costa Rica. Well, what's up?

123
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:05,610
And I think then he she told me I do interesting nutrition because she was in the nutrition department then.

124
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:13,270
Do I really I didn't have about that because my interest in genetics, I was interested in genetics.

125
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:19,750
And she told me I'm doing genetic interaction if then we can see what happened.

126
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:23,860
Then she invited me to to her lab.

127
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:30,250
I work for him for one year. And after I decide to apply to the program and then I was accepted, I get that fellowship then.

128
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:37,460
Then sometimes just I did something I do. Everything was fine at the end then.

129
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:45,430
Then just keep all your options open, even because my initial thought was nutrition.

130
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:52,670
I was thinking of a genetic thing. Adding nutrition and altering the epidemiology and activating.

131
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:59,900
Yeah. I was curious. During the one year you were working in her lab, what would you do?

132
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:04,519
In fact, I was doing what?

133
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,649
The lab analysis meaning, you know, typing.

134
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:16,400
I was doing genetic work because ah, we at that moment she was working in tight interaction in relation to myocardial infarction.

135
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:20,510
Then I was doing the actual, you know, typing, not the work.

136
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:26,050
These, you know, they are. History.

137
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:34,530
When I when I did my Ph.D. in genetics, in diet interactions, I did the act, but not the war by myself.

138
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:42,480
I remember at that time I was very happy because I was able to know by being said, 20 genetic markers, 20 at once.

139
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:50,000
So not. You can do medium or genetic markers.

140
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,680
Even you're going to need to do it.

141
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:58,000
You said you just keep your sample to cool up or here in the university they had to call up to do that work for you.

142
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:08,209
They are. I haven't been in the lab since since I got away with them because now all my work is statistical analysis.

143
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:12,290
Data analysis by. Yes, I was doing lab work.

144
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:25,920
Okay. Then again, these are some some consideration to take into account related to the I think we looked a little bit these are

145
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:32,610
unique and this is for you sell you need to think about you look how much over cycle time I need from a mental.

146
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:38,509
Also, you are going to work with the lab.

147
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:48,890
In a lab, usually you are going to be in with both dogs or or their doctoral students or research assistants.

148
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:55,640
You are the type of person that like to work in group or you are the light of personnel were more for yourself.

149
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,720
Then just consider that if.

150
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:09,910
Also, I will say these are all in consideration.

151
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:21,070
It's up to you. Inside each of our publications because we want for is requirements a format that is to audience.

152
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:27,280
We want for you to get this is published. Then you will need.

153
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:36,750
They're shared with others, maybe doctoral students all full.

154
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:44,230
I do that type of person down. Do you like to work in a loud environment?

155
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:51,510
Why then just feel too conceited about how you think about this or selecting women or not?

156
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:10,050
Now. Okay. The one with the paper that I that we wear, what we need to read for today.

157
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:20,930
Now, first and again, I would say that it's a combination of the type of research that you want to do about what you're feeling comfortable with.

158
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:29,089
That person will mentor for mastery is doing that again for for pedestrians.

159
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:33,170
I would say an important key is that you need to find a do over project.

160
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:41,489
Be prepared for mass arrest when you have less than two years because this method your need

161
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:47,820
to find your mentor and then most likely winter you are going to be writing your proposal.

162
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:57,150
Then you will have maybe a little more than a year to do the actual analysis, to do the actual writing your thesis.

163
00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:02,230
Then find a project that you do up in that period of time for students.

164
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:07,620
Also, even when you have more time. Also, you need to find a they doable during that period of time.

165
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:14,490
Remember. And I apologize if I knew much about Mabel.

166
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:24,530
But again, when when I was in Costa Rica, I remember Costa Rica, we didn't have a dozen women.

167
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:34,250
I think now we have. Then once again, two years.

168
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:39,650
MASTERS Then there were so my student working entomology.

169
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:44,990
Uh, what a start in that life cycle for some particular insect.

170
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:50,530
But I remember the life cycle of that. It was like a seven years.

171
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:56,400
And. And I'm interested to know what you need to find there for you,

172
00:20:56,790 --> 00:21:03,120
because we've just been five years in a monster disease waiting for that reproduction of these insects.

173
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:08,639
Then. Then you need to find a do over project. Exactly.

174
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:18,930
In the time that you have here. But but also b, b, b b, in addition to that, I will say that employer should be worth doing.

175
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:24,660
That should be something that is going to are. You have to feel passionate about your project.

176
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:34,610
But when? But look at this dress.

177
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:50,880
You are going. Why? You're just. But you are not passionate about the project.

178
00:21:51,800 --> 00:22:00,990
You don't feel that you are one. That doing something worth the idea for the public or for your own intellectual curiosity.

179
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:12,290
You are. You need to feel. Are. Then and again within the limits of what project equals I.

180
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:19,209
But. It's. Okay.

181
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:25,630
Then I think we have seen this type of use in some of the previous videos about the violence.

182
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:32,980
But also, remember, even when you are going to do your own theses, you are going to have far one relationship with your lot.

183
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:36,940
With the latter, you are going to war with your mentor, with other researchers.

184
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:41,950
It is a nice balance that you need to you need to find.

185
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:49,580
Now looking for that? What are the characteristics of absence of that?

186
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:54,650
I would say I mean, that's going to have to impress upon you now.

187
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:58,910
First has to be someone that has the interest in serving your main.

188
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:04,010
These ladies are. You need to ask that person.

189
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:08,240
You want to be my mentor? Do you have time to be my mentor?

190
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:13,310
You have the flexibility to make this commitment for my for my success.

191
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:24,050
Now, and this is important. Again, D, I want to discredit your mentor.

192
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:27,110
He's going to have an investment when you have success.

193
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:40,540
And your mentor even has to form times to take their personal time for you to read your proposal to help you with the analysis before it's out.

194
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:47,490
Let's talk about it then. Has to be a good match between you and your mate.

195
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:53,910
Of course it has to be. So has to have an expertize in the area because you asked me about to be your mentoring.

196
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:58,740
I don't know. In economics, don't I get this email from students?

197
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:11,320
I say it with my profile, but they are looking for BSD and then they try their doctor.

198
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:17,860
Sometimes they say doctoral level. The reason I want to do a doctor, a Ph.D. in economics.

199
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:25,930
Not. The jury may provide denials and right back very politely.

200
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:33,050
And that's not my area of expertize. And then you need to find a person to have this add this expertize in what you're interested.

201
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:41,780
But also your mentor is trying to art to see you are the that he tries to be successful.

202
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:52,180
Van de Beek Affairs. Do you need to be clear about what kind of support you need to do your own research now?

203
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:58,700
Also, you need to recognize that one single person most likely is not going to meet all

204
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:04,520
your mentoring needs because andthey are related to your question as to why.

205
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:13,220
Here I am talking about recession, mental asylum sometimes in academic life.

206
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:17,540
We need more than one mentor, for example.

207
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:27,170
This if I want to change my, let's say, my career path, what are the kind of person.

208
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:36,860
Or indicate that your students are maybe curious and more likely is going to be

209
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:41,510
attacked for research that is going to involve especially from different areas.

210
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:49,460
Then most likely you're that gender neutral media. You say your primary means or you're not going to meet all your needs.

211
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:55,580
Then be also, when selecting your committee, make clear that you are getting the right perspective.

212
00:25:55,580 --> 00:26:00,480
The right mix of effect is. Also,

213
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:05,880
you need to recognize that the mentoring needs you're going through change over time

214
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:11,040
because we start with the student with the start to guide the student by some time,

215
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:18,430
with the student to be more independent when they they, they process they go over that process with their research.

216
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:26,450
And of course, you have to be that you have to make the commitment on time to work with your mentor.

217
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:31,440
But it seems so far. What do you what do you think about this paper? Do you read it?

218
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:52,400
And they would use it for. But when the professor went to university and there was no there is no contract.

219
00:26:53,810 --> 00:27:02,870
But that is the aspect decision that if a person said to be your mentor is going to be with you,

220
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:08,560
at least during that time that you get that you need to graduate. Is it now?

221
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:18,040
Of course we are still unexpected events. But even though that person moved their say from here to another university,

222
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:27,580
even that in that case is still the Irish phone relationship going on for that person can be as deeply public a community can be.

223
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:35,110
Expectation is that he's going to be allies with you during the time that you need for you to do your research.

224
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:40,240
Now, this is not contract. These are these are bonuses.

225
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:47,159
A system honorable honor. Yes, because these are persons.

226
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:52,520
They want to be your mentor. Then we expect that person to be your mentor during the time that your.

227
00:27:55,810 --> 00:28:03,460
There is no legal agreement. But I'm trying to say. But what if the president has put in.

228
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:11,440
And expecting to be part of this paper like we do produce together.

229
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:16,550
But then that process leads and. So work.

230
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,930
No, no, that does it. That person has to even they say you're mentor, mentor.

231
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:23,450
You can be part of any publications.

232
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:29,450
They don't need to be here in the same institution to be part of that same publications now.

233
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:40,370
And this is also this is very important because usually when you are writing when you finish writing your thesis and get ready to publish your thesis,

234
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:46,490
most likely you are writing that paper.

235
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:51,170
Most likely you are going to be the first author of the paper, the first author,

236
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,100
and usually your mentor is the last one, what we call the senior author.

237
00:28:56,030 --> 00:29:01,100
But also you need to make clear with other members of your community, even with a person in the lab,

238
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:07,100
let's say you are working in a lab on the other person to help you with some elements.

239
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:17,870
What are the aspects of that bears regarding publication that that need to be make the beginning and I think we are I think we here we have a

240
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:28,130
lecture about how to use that now for offering a paper with back in those words phone conversation that you need to take with your mental.

241
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:35,820
Yeah. Um. Cause I go to the gym with them.

242
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:47,900
Not in this building, but somewhere else. Mm hmm. And, uh. So like since I helped do my people do it, I always see the same person because.

243
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:55,350
And so you think, you know, you are going to a writing lab,

244
00:29:55,530 --> 00:30:05,250
the person we don't expect to be part of your paper because you just had a feeling that I mean, the writing styles.

245
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:15,750
Well, when I get help, like chapter one, chapter two and the dual is you see the same writing assistant, my tutor teach me how to write better.

246
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:20,910
Should I always see the same person too? For the continuity of my paper?

247
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:25,499
You feel comfortable? You mean because your mentor is know your mentor.

248
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:31,140
Also, your research committee is going to write your paper, your thesis, and they are going to make corrections.

249
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:34,830
Everyone has different styles, but you have your own style.

250
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:40,350
Then most likely your your papers are going to reflect your style.

251
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:46,290
But but again, you are going to work with a lot of different impacts even during your career.

252
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:51,180
Because I asked you, I went to a publication with not only with your mentor.

253
00:30:54,530 --> 00:31:01,790
Now. Other characteristics, I really don't.

254
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:14,980
It is clear. I don't feel that I have nothing to add to this list.

255
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:23,819
And so with that geographically close to the mentee I yeah.

256
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:27,870
That was that. Yeah that's, that's true. And also very supportive.

257
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:38,279
I didn't I didn't I didn't mean to say that she wasn't supportive because she was traveling and that was about the the word that she was.

258
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:50,500
But she was very supportive from. So whether the race is missing their.

259
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:07,040
Also a mentor has to be.

260
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:12,890
I mean, this is an important feature here.

261
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:21,890
Honest. Not only flattering. Because I know we.

262
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:25,830
Yes. Do you feel like that?

263
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:29,970
Yeah. When you are messed up, you know too much.

264
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:37,050
We don't know where to look for them right now. Yeah, we want that mentor to be supportive of you.

265
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:42,180
Uh, that will support you both. Nice work.

266
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:53,820
However, they say you are behind in your work, or you are doing some analysis in the in the wrong way.

267
00:32:54,780 --> 00:33:03,760
They say you don't. You don't. But you are no longer meeting deadlines.

268
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:08,650
Then your mental has to be someone that is honest with you and say you are not advancing.

269
00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:13,690
Your research is. Is. Going is. I'm blind.

270
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:19,510
There has to be something that is going to alter that. You have to and you need to find out who that person is.

271
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:27,970
They're going to win because sometimes we try not to harm our feelings or we try to be nice,

272
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:31,210
but sometimes we need desperately to be honest and we see that through.

273
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:40,820
Other characteristics then that I did.

274
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:45,200
I thought that you read the papers and they are going to be beautiful for you.

275
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:49,520
Now. For a student.

276
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:54,260
You have a mentor. You when you are here, you have a ready your mentor.

277
00:33:54,530 --> 00:34:00,380
Now, for me as a student, you send me everyone your potential ideas about a research project.

278
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:03,590
Okay, then what I'm going to do now.

279
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:13,690
We'll look into those, not least because the idea during this semester is try to match you with a good mentor of someone.

280
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:18,640
That could be what we do with to look at your thesis.

281
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:22,210
Then I will. I will read that list.

282
00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:33,460
I will try to give you one option, or at least tool today to direct you to some potential faculty that may be interested to do doing work with you.

283
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:40,720
And again, remember, even when your mentor has to be someone here from the department.

284
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:44,920
But that doesn't mean that you can come into from a law and order university.

285
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:51,040
We can we can arrange that easily. Don't don't feel that you are limited for your options here.

286
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:58,930
QUESTION So far, not all research mentors do research in the lab, correct?

287
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:05,370
Correct. So it doesn't necessarily mean like we don't have to team up with the lab to find a research mentor.

288
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:08,580
We can do our own. Yeah. Right.

289
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:16,270
Yeah. Yes, that's a good point. Because also for both for master historians and again, remember that you have a shorter time.

290
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:22,719
Yeah. Then you are to work in the lab, you need to make clear and that's one thing that you need to talk with your potential mentor

291
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:28,450
with at any work lab is going to be doable within that short period of time that you have now.

292
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:36,940
Also, you do need to work in the lab because many of the research here in the department is using what we call secondary data,

293
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:40,890
data that have been collected for other reasons. And then you analyze the data.

294
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:59,800
Of course, you can collect your own data. Okay then how do top and Mrs. Students how you talk with any faculty about potential.

295
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:04,990
This is just. They are for me.

296
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:10,970
A student who? But they.

297
00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:17,650
But my students, please raise your hand.

298
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:24,160
You are really half a member. Okay.

299
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:28,280
Then my world will be with you. And try to find your mental.

300
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:36,610
Now for next week, we are going to watch another video.

301
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:41,530
This is the link is called How to Align Your Triangle Your Priorities.

302
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:47,210
These are in that same university seminar.

303
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:51,610
Then I think this is a little more than an hour to them.

304
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:58,080
Please. Let's start with you before our next class and again follow that.

305
00:36:58,110 --> 00:37:01,990
What gives this activity? You don't need to to give me anything.

306
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:05,350
I mean, this is not nothing more than going to collect for these.

307
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:10,300
However, the whole world will be be ready to discuss questions.

308
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:18,010
Okay. Also, before I forget, I forget again, I'm going to send a survey because as I told you at the beginning,

309
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:23,620
there is a group of students in my school and second year that they are they offer the opportunity

310
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:30,099
to go with you and you have some doubts and you have to talk about experience of being.

311
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:39,610
That is true. And I would tend to by the time that you are, you are interested and you will be an hour or something like that.

312
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:44,330
Okay. Then you don't have anything else then.

313
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:47,890
That is all for today. I will see you next Monday.

314
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:49,930
You're welcome.
