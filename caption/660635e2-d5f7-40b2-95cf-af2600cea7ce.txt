1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,110
Yeah. I'm like the opposite of a vampire.

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:09,480
If you don't ask me to go anywhere after the sunsets. Because unless I'm being driven there.

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,760
All righty. Hello? Hello. So.

4
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,440
Yeah. Yeah, I know. Yeah.

5
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:24,360
Yeah. How do you get home from work? Like in the wintertime?

6
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:29,880
I don't teach purposely. I teach all my classes in the fall, so I don't have to deal with, like, the snow and stuff.

7
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:37,380
So I work from home a lot in the winter semester and then when it starts to get dark,

8
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:45,570
I either try to like both get before five or I wait until like six to leave when there isn't as much traffic.

9
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:50,720
Yes. After recording started.

10
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:54,390
Yeah, that's okay. Any who?

11
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:01,470
Well, last night my online version of this class ended.

12
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:06,330
Isn't that wild? Yeah. So they're turning in their commentaries this weekend.

13
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:17,420
Finished the whole thing. So today we'll be talking about a bird that was going to be hers was in the Congo, but her.

14
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:32,940
No, that's been [INAUDIBLE]. Yesterday I went to the DEA open meeting and like Burnley raised the question about when are we going to

15
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:39,430
get more of that diverse faculty and faculty that specifically do research in environmental justice.

16
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:44,100
And hopefully soon it should be next academic year, actually,

17
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:54,000
because I think right now the only people who teach anything related to J in our classes is myself and Dr. Charles.

18
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,880
In this in this in this department, we are the only people of color.

19
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:10,110
Well, I guess, doctor, she. But, you know, I know people of color in the department, so, you know, read between the lines there.

20
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:21,750
So today we'll be talking about environmental justice and overview, having a little bit of a discussion and then won't take the whole time.

21
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:27,389
So we'll do like a midterm recap afterwards and we'll probably still end early today.

22
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:39,660
I think so. All right. So by definition, the EPA defines environmental justice as fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people,

23
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:43,590
regardless of race, color, national origin or income.

24
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:50,790
With respect to development, implementation and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, policies.

25
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:57,540
The goal will be achieved when everyone enjoys the same degree of protection from environmental and health

26
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:05,189
hazards and equal access to the decision making process to have a healthy work environment in which to live,

27
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:09,990
learn and work. Have we achieved this same degree yet?

28
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:11,340
No.

29
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:23,340
So as I mentioned in class on Tuesday, I think they established additional funding now towards e.g. efforts to address equity and racism explicitly.

30
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:28,110
Environmental racism is definitely nothing new.

31
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:37,260
So historically people of color are exposed to greater amounts of pollution, toxic chemical exposures and contaminants.

32
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:44,520
They're also more likely to be living in communities adjacent to landfills, hazardous waste dumps,

33
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:50,820
manufacturing, industrial plans, and then truck depots or even train stations.

34
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:58,800
Okay. So 50%, 56% of the population near toxic waste sites are people of color.

35
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:09,600
They generally have 38% higher nitrogen dioxide exposure, two times more likely to live without potable water and modern sanitation.

36
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:18,690
And 95% of claims against polluters have been denied by the EPA.

37
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:24,000
So the placement of these things is certainly not an accident.

38
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:30,209
And communities of color have been battling these justices for indep for decades now.

39
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:39,780
Sometimes they build these facilities next to communities of color just because the property in those areas are devalued,

40
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:49,080
right, due to redlining and racist practices, or sometimes the the plant or the toxic site might already exist.

41
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:57,780
But those areas adjacent to it is the only one, only places where there's affordable housing that they can afford to live or historically,

42
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:00,280
you know, when there was still a lot of racial or. Nation.

43
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:15,620
And there's still redlining to this day, you know, like predatory loan practices or even like racist racism within like selling houses and all that.

44
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:19,220
I don't know if I shared the anecdote just a couple of weeks ago in The New York Times,

45
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:25,969
there was a black professor who was trying to sell his house, and then it was like way undervalued.

46
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:29,780
And he is he had his white colleague come in and pose as the owner of the house.

47
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:38,780
And the house got appraised for for much higher. So with the origins of environmental justice,

48
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:49,790
environmental justice started primarily as individuals of color seeking to address a lack of equity and environmental protection in their communities.

49
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:59,150
Dr. Professor Robert Bullard, who is at Texas Southern University, is where Megan Thee Stallion recently graduated from.

50
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:04,850
But it is an HBCU, so he is considered the father of environmental justice.

51
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:08,330
He's still very much alive, still very much at an activist,

52
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:15,080
whether by conscious design or institutional neglect, communities of color in urban ghettos,

53
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:20,240
in rural poverty pockets, or an economically impoverished Native American reservations,

54
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:24,320
they some of the worst environmental devastation in the nation.

55
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:32,360
So really, we started to see the E.J. movement kind of coincide with the civil rights movement in the 1960s,

56
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:38,929
where it began to raise simultaneous awareness discussion and kind of like lead to advocacy,

57
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:47,780
not only for voting rights and human rights, but also for better public health conditions for individuals, their families and communities.

58
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,790
So let's watch this very brief video on E j.

59
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:00,360
Speaker. Is this coming out of okay.

60
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,440
But loud enough.

61
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:16,450
Nationally, the facilities where we dump our garbage and process dangerous chemicals tend to be located in poor and minority communities.

62
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:21,970
The people who live there have little or no protection from the industries around them, and things could get worse.

63
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,390
So there's this idea of environmental justice. It's pretty simple.

64
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:34,810
Communities shouldn't be forced to deal with more pollution because they belong to a certain race, national origin or income bracket.

65
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:40,720
Yet America has struggled over the years to implement any serious policy that actually protects these communities.

66
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:49,390
So let's lay out the ways the government has failed them. We will not allow one county to become a dump site.

67
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:54,849
The fight for environmental justice took off in 1982 when residents of Warren County, North Carolina,

68
00:07:54,850 --> 00:08:00,520
mounted mass demonstrations against a plan to dump contaminated soil in a landfill in their community.

69
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:08,830
The EPA investigated four similar landfills in southern states and found that they were all located in black or low income neighborhoods.

70
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:14,530
In 1987, the United Church of Christ Racial Justice Commission found that around the country,

71
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:19,180
hazardous waste facilities were more likely to be located in mostly minority communities.

72
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:24,130
Amid mounting proof, the federal government was forced to act.

73
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:32,140
George Herbert Walker Bush. So in 1992, President George H.W. Bush founded the Office of Environmental Justice inside the EPA.

74
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:33,940
Two years later,

75
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:41,020
President Bill Clinton signed an executive order requiring federal agencies to consider environmental justice and all of their policies,

76
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:44,620
as well as extending civil rights protections to environmental discrimination.

77
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:48,490
But Congress never passed a bill to make Clinton's executive order a law.

78
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,730
Then came George W Bush.

79
00:08:52,180 --> 00:09:00,160
His administration shifted the focus of the Office of Environmental Justice from protecting low income and minority communities to all people,

80
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:04,150
leaving vulnerable populations without a federal environmental advocate.

81
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:08,950
80% of New Orleans, including much of downtown, is underwater under Bush.

82
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:13,120
Many environmental civil rights claims were rejected or delayed for years.

83
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:19,960
In 2009, after President Barack Obama's election, his administration recommitted to environmental justice.

84
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:32,710
Generally speaking, in this country, a lot of environmentally problematic facilities tend to be located in places where poor folks live.

85
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:37,600
Yet during the two years Democrats controlled the House, the Senate and the White House,

86
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:41,740
they didn't follow a single bill focused on strengthening environmental justice protections.

87
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:49,150
Passing major environmental legislation faded further when Republicans took control of Congress in the 2010 midterm elections.

88
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:54,370
Now, President Donald J. Trump is making good on his vow to weaken the EPA.

89
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:57,670
Environmental Protection. What they do is a disgrace.

90
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:01,420
Every week they come out with new regulations that make it going to protect the environment.

91
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:04,720
They will be fine with the environment. We can leave a little bit.

92
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:12,010
This budget, a 31% cut to the EPA, $2.6 billion cut away from the EPA.

93
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:16,140
That's what the president wants as the EPA loses funding and regulations are rolled back.

94
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,440
Vulnerable communities may very likely fall through the cracks.

95
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:25,800
I'm telling you first, I'll be covering these communities and digging into systemic environmental injustice.

96
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:31,110
If you have something to tell me, email me at Celia Dot Buford at ProPublica.org.

97
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:38,070
Okay. I know she went over that super fast.

98
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:43,310
So we'll go over the timeline in more detail and then the slides of you download them.

99
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:52,389
All of this information is in the notes. So, so really they talked about, you know, some some seminal key points in the timeline.

100
00:10:52,390 --> 00:11:00,280
This is a very abbreviated timeline. According to the EPA on environmental justice, you can find a quite lengthier one on their website.

101
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:08,380
But in 1968, you know, as Memphis was a kind of a hot spot for activism in civil rights,

102
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:15,639
a strike was taken against unfair treatment and environmental justice concerns in Tennessee.

103
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:19,750
And this incident was actually investigated by Martin Luther King Jr.

104
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:28,010
Himself. So the strike advocated for fair and better pay and working conditions for Memphis garbage workers.

105
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:35,169
So garbage workers was the the the a lot of garbage workers have a very different lifestyle now than they once did.

106
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:40,569
Just because of automation. The clock comes out and can pick up, you know, the garbage can.

107
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:43,510
So they just have to essentially work the machinery in the car.

108
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:48,700
But in some cities and municipalities and even in New York City, they don't they don't have that.

109
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:53,950
So there are still workers having to like drag trash and throw it into the back of trucks.

110
00:11:54,250 --> 00:12:01,000
And as you can imagine, people throw all kinds of stuff away from like diapers to dog foods to various bloodborne pathogens.

111
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:16,810
So this was the first time that African Americans in the nation ever mobilized, trying to oppose broad environmental justices in 1968,

112
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:25,930
then in 1982, which they mentioned in the Carolinas and that area, this was the second major time there was a national broad based group.

113
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:32,950
They did a nonviolent sit in for PCBs in Warren County in North Carolina.

114
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:37,780
And over 500 environmentalists and civil rights activists were arrested.

115
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:46,540
And so, you know, unfortunately, they were unsuccessful in stopping this PCB landfill from proceeding.

116
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:51,879
But it is widely thought of as the catalyst for the movement.

117
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:56,650
So a lot of movement and activity was happening between the sixties to the eighties,

118
00:12:56,650 --> 00:13:00,430
but it started actually really getting traction in the early eighties.

119
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:10,720
From there, in 83, the General Accounting Office conducted a study that they said galvanized the movement, essentially providing quantitative support,

120
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:18,760
that environmental racism was indeed impacting citizens of the United States based on policies that we make.

121
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:27,070
And then they mentioned in the video 87, the United Church of Christ Commission on Racial Justice actually released a report on toxic waste,

122
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:34,390
and they showed a statistical relationship between hazardous waste sites and then low as racial ethnic composition.

123
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:38,290
Around 15 million African-Americans, 8 million Hispanics,

124
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:47,770
half of all Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders and Native Americans live in communities with at least one abandoned or uncontrolled waste site.

125
00:13:48,520 --> 00:14:01,059
When waste sites are done, there is a, you know, generally landfills like there's one in Ypsi, near East Michigan Avenue,

126
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:07,990
where it looks like a giant hill, but it's just like where a dump site used to be after they leave it.

127
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:10,600
Yeah, generally they do turn it into green space,

128
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:19,150
but you have to have like technology in there and leachate systems to keep the trash underneath it from off gassing continually.

129
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:28,120
And those gases, you know, eventually can condense and liquefy and then seep into the the soil and then the aquifers and the water as well.

130
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:35,980
So if it's not if it's abandoned and it's uncontrolled, or even though the waste site is no longer functioning, it can still cause a lot of harm.

131
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,770
Then in 88, the West Harlem Environmental Action, or what they call We Act,

132
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:50,410
was created to to address ongoing community struggles regarding this North River sewage management plant in New York City.

133
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:56,260
Then 1990, indigenous environmental groups started to form as well.

134
00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:03,490
Then 91, the National People of Color Summit convened in Washington, D.C.,

135
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:11,590
was attended by several hundred black indigenous people of color and 17 principles of environmental justice were adopted.

136
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:18,729
Then we see Bill Clinton's executive order in 94 that they mentioned, but it wasn't passed.

137
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:25,810
And then finally in 2000 to the EPA, officers began implementing Environmental Justice Action.

138
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:34,360
One of my students in my other class is taking a class in seas around environmental justice.

139
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:38,840
Sustainability and Indigenous communities have any boutique in that class.

140
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,069
She she has a lot of interesting thoughts to share.

141
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:48,770
But basically in that class she shared with me how they were talking about how we were talking about the concept of one health,

142
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:56,290
which is animal humans and the environment and environmental justice, and how indigenous folks have been practicing this forever.

143
00:15:56,300 --> 00:16:00,530
That's been their way of life. And same thing with, you know, environmental justice.

144
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:07,850
And people seem to think some of these concepts are new, but really it's just only gaining traction now.

145
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:15,770
So the EPA does have something called the Egis screen, which uses GIs.

146
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:18,470
So I thought we could play with the mapper a little bit.

147
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:25,910
So here you can see we can pick different things we want to look at for their environmental justice indices.

148
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:33,920
They have particulate matter, 2.5 ozone diesel particulate matter, toxic toxics related to cancer risk,

149
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:43,340
respiratory issues, traffic lead paint, superfund proximity, hazardous waste site proximity, underground storage tanks.

150
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:51,229
Then you can look at pollution sources, socioeconomic indicators, health disparities, climate change, critical service gaps.

151
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:56,090
And then there's more demographics. But we won't get too into that, but we can layer a few.

152
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:05,750
So I'm going to play around just really quickly to layer a few, and then I'll let you all give me suggestions on place you want to look at.

153
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:09,650
So if we look at something like PM 2.5, right,

154
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:21,800
which we know PM 2.5 can lead to arthralgia atherosclerosis and cause greater coronary and disease and result in like a lot of respiratory issues.

155
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:29,300
So maybe we can zoom in here, look at where we are in our brewer and Troy.

156
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,589
Let's add on lead. Oh, okay.

157
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:39,200
One layer. How dare they? All right. What about socioeconomic indicator?

158
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:45,109
How about we put people of color? Well, I guess they won't let me layer, but.

159
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:48,750
Okay, let's look at pay attention to you. So here's the PM cheat.

160
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:51,980
Okay, so let's okay, so let's look quickly.

161
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:56,960
This is where people are. Sorry, this is our people of color are all right.

162
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:07,219
This is where PM 2.5 is ozone traffic, proximity, lead paint.

163
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:10,610
The darker the worse it is. Superfund proximity.

164
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:19,309
We're doing okay here in Southeast Michigan, hazardous waste proximity, wastewater discharge, and then pollution sources.

165
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:26,690
Here we go. If we look at climate change data, let's look at 100 year plain floodplain.

166
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:31,550
Some of these areas are not doing so hot. What about drought?

167
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:41,840
Uh, not too bad here. Is there any area or region that you all are in particular interested in looking at?

168
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:46,340
I can zoom. Zoom like Lake Michigan.

169
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:49,780
MID-MICHIGAN Oh, good. Okay, we're here.

170
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:55,940
What's considered mid-Michigan like, right in the middle and the bay?

171
00:18:56,930 --> 00:19:00,940
Yep. Oh, Midland. Okay. Sorry. Okay.

172
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:08,470
Yeah, that's where I'm from. So you want to look at 100 year flood plain? Um.

173
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,260
Bay City's definitely going to be underwater at some point.

174
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:17,190
It looks like we got a lot of boats. Yeah.

175
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:24,120
Sea level rise, thankfully resistant to the oceans.

176
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:33,209
But if you look at environmental justice index indices, for example, PM 2.5, not as much of an issue in Bay City.

177
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:39,930
I don't know what are the demographics like there? Beach It's kind of mixed over segments, pretty big right next to us.

178
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:44,980
But then Midwest is also kind of close, so it's kind of a mixture of populations.

179
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:51,300
Okay, okay. There used to be a really big factory, like feeling that, Oh, what about Superfund proximity?

180
00:19:55,260 --> 00:20:00,330
Okay, what about lead paint? Yeah, because he said it used to be really big with manufacturing.

181
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,660
Yeah. That they were dumping stuff there.

182
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,920
Yeah. Yes, yes. Hazardous waste proximity.

183
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,780
Not currently. Right. But Superfund means historically.

184
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:21,090
Yeah. And then underground water storage tanks. They've got a lot of other areas of interest.

185
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:26,910
I can zoom out. Got the whole country near the New Orleans.

186
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:31,580
New Orleans. Okay, do, do, do.

187
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:42,750
Okay. That's just it. All right, so here we are.

188
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:49,530
Take off this 100 year flood plain. What are we interested in looking at in New Orleans?

189
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:54,610
Climate change. Okay.

190
00:20:55,240 --> 00:21:00,340
100 year flood plain. What's what's going to be left in 100 years?

191
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:04,930
Right. This is all going to be underwater.

192
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:09,760
Sea level rise even just leads to two feet.

193
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:25,680
Okay. What about six feet? People in Baton Rouge are about to have beachfront property and sea level rise like happening.

194
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:33,530
Right. Like one is saying one. But it will happen. Oh, it's already happening now.

195
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:38,850
But they didn't put a eight year projection for when it will actually happen.

196
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:42,860
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah. When will it be? Six feet.

197
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:46,320
Like, that's a piece. That's. Yeah, that's a piece that's missing for sure.

198
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:53,339
I don't have an answer to that for you. What about socioeconomic indicators?

199
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:59,820
People of color. Notice how they mostly live down in these coastal.

200
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:12,510
Like closer to the water. Right. And then pollution sources are not a lot of underground water storage tanks there in Philly.

201
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,770
Um, more PM 2.5 in Baton Rouge.

202
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:24,810
I'm interested in bring it over here back to where I'm from.

203
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:30,180
So many people living in the Bay Area now, so expensive,

204
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:37,859
they keep talking about how the next earthquake is going to cause the bay to just snap off into the ocean.

205
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:42,240
People joke about that. But if you look at people of color here.

206
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:45,750
Right. Mostly, you know, I mean, there's. Yeah.

207
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:55,709
But if you look at climate change data in terms of hundred year plain, my parents live here in Elk Grove.

208
00:22:55,710 --> 00:23:02,610
Right. So a lot of the Sacramento Valley is probably going to be in a floodplain.

209
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:10,739
And then by sea level rise, if we do one foot, uh, it takes out a good, you know, that's where the bay currently is.

210
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:14,910
So it's not too severe. But then you start getting into like Vallejo and all that.

211
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:16,620
That's where like Six Flags is.

212
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:29,370
And then if we look at six feet, it starts to increase to a certain level, but definitely not as severe as I thought it would actually.

213
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,360
Other places of interest. No.

214
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:39,050
Okay. I think we look at that and then. NAVA Oh, for sure.

215
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:44,030
Okay. Let me close this.

216
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:53,520
Back to the mitten and it's over somewhere.

217
00:23:53,520 --> 00:24:01,290
But it's the. It's like my the border.

218
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:11,170
Oh, there it is. Okay. Okay. All right.

219
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,650
What do we want to look at? People of color. Okay.

220
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:25,880
Let's look at. So did they break it down by race or ethnicity, or is it a people code?

221
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:31,970
It's just as just as they probably is our gas for this.

222
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:40,010
So if you look at how they specifically measure it in their reports, you probably find a more detailed answer.

223
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:44,180
So very clearly we can see here like Benton Harbor, right?

224
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:50,850
No. Like Saint Joe is often the comparing city that they use with its proximity to Benton Harbor.

225
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:54,660
But Saint Joseph is predominantly white and very affluent.

226
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:59,470
What what indicators do you want to look at here? Really?

227
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,640
Um, I just like the general.

228
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:12,900
I feel like I've only heard about the Red Oak kids, that there's other like it there's a secret, there's led right lit up like that.

229
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:18,810
Super fun proximity. Okay. PM 2.5.

230
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:28,440
Interestingly, even though it's on the coast, right. So and then if we look at, oh, let's see, hazardous waste proximity,

231
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:38,620
but the lead and these superfund is very prevalent where wastewater discharge within that superfund means that there's multiples,

232
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:43,470
there's like a site that's contained within the red or is either multiple.

233
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:48,750
There's probably only one site contained in the red that's just leaching into the entire area.

234
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:55,350
You can look on the national priorities list for current Superfund sites and what they're doing there.

235
00:25:55,350 --> 00:26:03,749
And then for climate change. If we look at coastal flood hazard, if we look at hundred year, not too bad.

236
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:08,450
And if we look at sea level rise, they're pretty resistant since it's the lakes.

237
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:16,169
Yes. QUESTION Is this like a Superfund site where like it's been deemed like really, really bad?

238
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:20,969
And then there's like that one agency in the EPA that's supposed to come and like address it.

239
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:23,520
Is that what Superfund users of something else?

240
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:36,629
So a Superfund site is under the Cercla Cercla Act and then basically they deem like this site super too toxic,

241
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:46,230
right, to be environmentally sustainable. So the EPA in essence, does coordinate as the main person to remediate remediate the Superfund site.

242
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:54,960
But people who are responsible for that are the polluters, the private, the the polluters, whether past or present.

243
00:26:55,350 --> 00:27:02,670
So companies can be fined for polluting that they did 30 years ago if it was deemed a Superfund site today.

244
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:06,719
So they're responsible for like funding the remediation,

245
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:14,100
but the remediation is sometimes frequently done by contractors and not like government or EPA personnel themselves.

246
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:20,579
They just oversee the mitigation and then they might also hire contracting companies to do the environmental

247
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:26,129
testing or industrial hygiene has to come if it's lead in the ground to peer out periodically,

248
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:31,680
commons sample it because they have to like literally scoop out all of the dirt and replace it.

249
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:40,770
They can't just like treat it and turn it over. So depending on what specific chemicals they are, very seldom is it just one issue, like lead.

250
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:44,130
It's usually like a half a dozen things that they're trying to address.

251
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:50,219
So remediating a Superfund site can take several years, two decades.

252
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:54,750
But the EPA just oversees it. Yeah, I just I remember.

253
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:59,940
And ah, you just have to take for the program.

254
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:07,110
I think Dr. Michael talked about a community in New York that was like built on oh, the Love Canal.

255
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:10,380
Yeah. And I was like, is that what a separate plant is?

256
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:17,070
Yes. Yes. But they didn't know at the time when they built the Love Canal community that it was that toxic.

257
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:27,120
And then there's an interesting documentary on it. But yes, lots of babies are born with abnormalities.

258
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:33,329
You're just going to see to an issue that the EPA has is that a lot of the companies that,

259
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:36,900
you know, it was mostly right after World War Two that the food was the worst.

260
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:45,030
Was there no regulations yet? But one lot of the regulations have been like closed since then and it's hard to find responsible people.

261
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:50,219
Yeah, but at the same time it's ultimately sometimes companies have been bought out and the old the new companies like well,

262
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:55,379
we didn't we didn't do this damage. But like you're still technically responsible for ties in with the company.

263
00:28:55,380 --> 00:29:00,690
But yeah, it does. And they talk like Rick Roe, cradle to the great, cradle to the grave.

264
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:07,799
Right. So that happens a lot where like companies will go out of business and now it's some new unnamed company or

265
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:13,410
like they got bought out by some other company and they weren't aware that this blah blah blah was happening.

266
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:18,390
So it can be very complicated. So I.

267
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:26,380
Your taxpayer dollars do go into funding some Superfund sites, but complicated.

268
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:33,040
And yet it's wild to think that before the seventies, when the EPA was created and cercla and all that,

269
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:36,790
people were just wildly just dumping anything everywhere.

270
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:47,469
Yeah. Yeah. So environmental justice today is actually led by more so grassroot organizations

271
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:52,330
throughout the country trying to get permanent change for environmental protections.

272
00:29:53,020 --> 00:30:00,999
We're now seeing the federal government get into it. But just really at the beginning and traditionally these environmental groups have also

273
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:07,090
performed partnerships with environmental organizations to try to get more systemic change.

274
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:13,239
But it's obviously a continued struggle because those who have traditionally lived,

275
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:21,280
worked and played closest to sources of environmental degradation are the ones that are willing to speak up and champion for themselves.

276
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:26,260
But those generally are not the same people making the policy decisions.

277
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:34,630
So this is just a short review. And E.J., each communities of color.

278
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:47,150
It's impossible to talk about. This climate crisis is longer than with our communities of color,

279
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:52,340
lower wealth communities and indigenous people who have been disproportionately impacted.

280
00:30:54,170 --> 00:31:01,820
They've borne the brunt of this ongoing crisis due to a history of systemic racism that exposed these communities to toxins and disease.

281
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:14,560
But now there is a new push for environmental justice coming from the highest levels of government and grassroots organizers around the country.

282
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:25,510
South Memphis is a predominantly black community.

283
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:31,170
This is the remarkable place right here.

284
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:37,590
There's a small community called Barksdale, the oldest African American black community in Memphis.

285
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:42,450
Come on here. Go to school. Now, why you wear jumpsuits?

286
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:45,989
It's like putting on armor made of cotton. And I feel instantly powerful.

287
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:49,230
And with great power comes hot. Fashion abilities. Cotton.

288
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:53,580
The fabric of Reid is super an alter ego. Get ready dating world.

289
00:31:54,120 --> 00:32:00,479
Okay. The folks are descendants of formerly enslaved people who opposed emancipation.

290
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,320
Bill Barksdale.

291
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:11,460
It gets his name because the people used some of the materials from boxcars that were near the railway station to actually build their homes.

292
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:17,610
And so they're carrying the history of freedmen and freed women literally in their DNA.

293
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:29,060
There's a responsibility to protect this community and there's a deep level of concern about what's happening.

294
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:37,780
Justin J. Pierson is a 27 year old activist with deep ties to South Memphis.

295
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:46,470
They kind of smell it. Yeah, the smell changed, didn't it?

296
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:54,599
Right. Like, imagine coming to school some days and smelling like this, and you just trying to figure out what is that like?

297
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:58,680
Is that sewage? But what is it? But now it's these stackers.

298
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:04,740
It's like the dirty is part of the after smell of a match going out.

299
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:10,680
We would go to my grandmother's houses every Sunday after church.

300
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:14,880
You drive up off the exit and there these pillars of smoke.

301
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:17,220
And as a kid, I was fascinated by it.

302
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:25,890
And it wasn't until relatively recently I would say that I began to understand that the folks who breathe that air,

303
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:33,300
right, that's us where we get to greet us is not a welcome to Southwest Memphis sign.

304
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:40,470
What we get are these toxins, these billows of smoke and chemicals that are literally killing us.

305
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:47,010
Over the years, South Memphis has seen industrial factories encroach upon its borders.

306
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:55,169
Today, there are 29 toxic facilities releasing chemicals into the air in the South Memphis area.

307
00:33:55,170 --> 00:34:00,090
We do see a disproportionate amount of pneumonias, bronchitis, diabetes,

308
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:05,970
autoimmune diseases and air pollution is probably the largest environmental factor.

309
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:15,560
And those diseases. When I was growing up, there was a place there was a chemical factory over there and we lived around it.

310
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:21,860
And so many of the people around that area developed breast cancer on the same street, on the same block.

311
00:34:22,910 --> 00:34:29,510
Yeah, a whole lot of people in is there and they're sick and then they and they didn't know what was wrong with them.

312
00:34:29,930 --> 00:34:35,630
This is my dad, Miller T Nicholson. He was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2010.

313
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:39,620
There is something systematically going on that is killing us.

314
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:51,480
You red line black folks into a particular community where toxins are being pumped into the air.

315
00:34:53,010 --> 00:35:01,440
And the consequences are in the death rate are in the cancer rates are in the asthma rates of our community.

316
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:08,750
The folks in these communities are the ones who bear the burden of environmental racism.

317
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,890
They bear the burden of economic injustice. They bear these burdens.

318
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:21,820
And they're screaming. That is a perpetuation of injustice that has happened in this place called America in southwest Memphis for far too long.

319
00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:28,780
Environmental injustices look like Cancer Alley between New Orleans and Baton Rouge,

320
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:35,920
where we have these cancer clusters where communities who were freed from slavery founded their own communities,

321
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:44,200
and then petrochemical facilities began to surround them, to pollute them, to take away their hope and their possibilities for a better future.

322
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:49,420
Now, there is a threat coming not just from the air, but from the ground below.

323
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:56,110
Politicians should not be in education. They're initiating censorship.

324
00:35:57,310 --> 00:36:01,959
There is a proposal to build the Byhalia pipeline, a 45 mile crude oil pipeline,

325
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:07,120
which would run through South Memphis on top of the city's main source of clean drinking water.

326
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:14,330
The pipeline is going to go through here about 100 yards that way.

327
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:28,430
We are standing next to a feeder. Well, and this pump is pulling water up from the Memphis Sand Aquifer, which is about three or 400 feet below here.

328
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:34,490
And that's the pristine good water. It's pre industrial, pre plastic.

329
00:36:34,970 --> 00:36:39,530
No pea face in it. It's just good pure water, which is why we like to keep it that way.

330
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:47,300
Ward Archer is one of the many grassroots activists fighting to protect the water supply for residents of South Memphis.

331
00:36:48,350 --> 00:36:54,800
Anybody who thinks a pipeline doesn't leak is living in a dream world.

332
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:03,330
So this red line is the proposed behavior pipeline.

333
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:10,470
These are people's homes and the pipeline is almost adjacent to it.

334
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:19,890
You know, and I realize the calls, as long as Westwood and Box Town are the ones carrying the risk of this.

335
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:27,630
It's okay. But when it was Collierville or Germantown, they said, No, we can't do those war.

336
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:34,950
Or You know why? You know what is racial and it's economic.

337
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:38,490
There was a community meeting that behavior pipeline held,

338
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:44,010
and they were asked by one of the members of the community, Why did you all choose this route?

339
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:50,490
And there's usually a PR answer. But instead, the representative was pretty clear and plain.

340
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:53,970
What do you say? We basically chose a point of least resistance.

341
00:37:56,010 --> 00:38:00,720
When people aren't scripted, you can really learn what they believe and what they think.

342
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:10,050
But they didn't check the boxes of resilience. They didn't check the boxes of courage of the people in the community.

343
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:17,820
And so now that point and path of least resistance is one of the most significant points of resilience and in some ways,

344
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:24,660
revolution that's happening in our country. So for all that I saw, you did not come in before.

345
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:32,760
BLOCK This pipeline will be a bomb for us in this neighborhood.

346
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:42,000
BLOCK To meet you. Thank you, ma'am. I appreciate who's taking the picture.

347
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:46,350
Vice president and environmental activist Al Gore has taken an interest in the

348
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:50,940
movement attending the rally put on by the Memphis community against the pipeline.

349
00:38:52,470 --> 00:39:00,690
I know the water's good. I'm almost 70 years old and I remember the water coming out of the ground here, old pump.

350
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:09,450
And that water would come out of the ground so cold we didn't have a whole lot, but we had everything.

351
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:20,940
If anybody is ever tempted to feel like we don't have the ability, that you don't have the ability as a community to win this battle,

352
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:26,220
you just remember that political will is itself a renewable resource.

353
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:34,940
Thank you. Keep up the fight. Oh, the storm.

354
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:38,840
Oh, the mountains.

355
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:50,989
In moving, these polluting companies have learned how to use their money and political power to serve their interests instead of the public interests.

356
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:58,580
And the only way to counter that is to have many more people at the grassroots level speaking up and speaking out.

357
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:08,600
Dr. King, when he was convincing folks to come to Memphis for the sanitation workers strike, said this The movement lives or dies in Memphis.

358
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:13,970
The environmental justice movement continues to grow and expand.

359
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:21,530
People are also saying that we can win on the climate crisis if we come together

360
00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:27,920
and we send to racial justice and environmental justice issues that go away.

361
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:33,760
This is a moment when we can bring hope back to communities where we can reinvest in communities.

362
00:40:33,770 --> 00:40:36,800
We have a chance to move people from surviving to thriving.

363
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:50,860
We have a chance for a new day. Okay.

364
00:40:57,420 --> 00:41:05,470
Thoughts or reactions to the. Someone look up whether out the pipeline happened.

365
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:14,500
Okay. So again, E.J., an infectious disease emergency response here we have again,

366
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:18,700
I showed you at the very beginning of the semester the epidemiological triad.

367
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:24,430
But environmental justice in communities is again tied to all of these environments.

368
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:34,420
And, you know, as we've talked about throughout the class, we've seen now how colonial and racism explain the inept response to Hurricane Maria.

369
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:40,000
Hurricane Fiona happened two weeks ago. President Biden only just came to visit on Monday.

370
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:49,210
We were talking about that in my online class last night. You know, Dr. Fauci said the pandemic exposed undeniable effects of racism.

371
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:53,259
It's definitely underscored the racism in the country.

372
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:57,370
Right. And then disaster aid often favoring white people.

373
00:41:57,370 --> 00:41:59,920
So. Oh, sorry. It's okay.

374
00:42:00,130 --> 00:42:07,900
So the federal government, like I said, if you look up some some New York Times articles showing folks with identical claims to FEMA,

375
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:12,840
but just being of different race and ethnicity, receiving different contributions.

376
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:21,549
HUD This summer my internship was with Disaster Recovery Team and I heard and there is like a report that's comparing

377
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:31,450
the differences between Harvey and Maria in 2017 and the effects of Maria were much more devastating than Harvey.

378
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:42,070
And I think FEMA allocated over 120 million to Harvey and just like around 2 million or more.

379
00:42:42,070 --> 00:42:45,520
Yeah. So you already feel like the big difference in how much you know is going to allocate.

380
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:50,379
And then over half of the claims for people in Puerto Rico were denied.

381
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:57,300
And a lot of that is because of their laws, because they have civil and common law, because they were Spanish on the floor.

382
00:42:58,450 --> 00:42:59,859
They don't have like formal titles,

383
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:04,960
which wasn't actually a requirement for a few other because they don't have formal, I don't think, rejecting people.

384
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:16,210
Thank you for sharing. When President Biden was there on Monday, he said that the bipartisan infrastructure bill they just passed last year,

385
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:21,370
he said 60 million would go to efforts to rebuild Puerto Rico.

386
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:25,370
But, you know, $60 million is not enough for sure.

387
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:32,330
Yeah. And then Harvey obviously hit Houston very hard.

388
00:43:32,330 --> 00:43:40,100
But people five years out from today still have not fixed their homes and they're predominantly in the zip codes of people of color.

389
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:43,490
And they've also had their claims denied by FEMA as well.

390
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:50,240
There are also words like a fair housing investigation into Harvey about whether there was

391
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:55,860
an equitable distribution by because typically disaster funds are given to the government.

392
00:43:55,910 --> 00:44:02,360
So like the state of Texas and the way that they allocated points was like what

393
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:08,089
percentage of the population would be benefited by these programs in the urban areas,

394
00:44:08,090 --> 00:44:10,670
which is where predominantly people of color are?

395
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:18,700
If you say a thousand people benefit, the percentage is so low because they're high dense areas and then rural communities,

396
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:22,760
which could say like, well, a thousand people. So it's 15% of people.

397
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:28,670
So that's where the money went, which is actively discriminating against particularly.

398
00:44:28,910 --> 00:44:32,960
So the state had to pay back the money for their communities.

399
00:44:33,930 --> 00:44:39,079
Yeah, exactly. It's adorable. It's really disheartening. Yeah.

400
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:46,250
Yeah. I think you heard and also in that article were there. Thank you, Lexi, where they were talking about rebuilding after Harvey.

401
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:52,070
And it's been five years and some communities are still people's homes are still totally ravaged.

402
00:44:52,730 --> 00:44:58,130
Thank you. The state of Texas, because they allocated the funds they got from the federal government,

403
00:44:58,430 --> 00:45:04,850
they gave it to a lot of predominantly white cities inland from Houston that weren't

404
00:45:04,850 --> 00:45:10,309
even affected by the hurricane just to further build like they are resource poor.

405
00:45:10,310 --> 00:45:14,750
So. System. Yeah. Yeah. Pretty messed up.

406
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:22,920
Okay. Yes, Lexi. I just was looking at the pipeline building there.

407
00:45:23,910 --> 00:45:32,600
Yeah, that. So it actually works because we know Keystone XL, what happened there.

408
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:39,530
And then the line six pipeline, which I think we'll talk about later this semester, not a promising story either.

409
00:45:40,850 --> 00:45:46,480
All right. Moving on to what's going to be on the midterms.

410
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:50,240
Okay. So again, midterm, 50 points.

411
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:55,010
30 questions in class.

412
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:59,360
Closed note. Closed book. Closed Laptop. Closed phone.

413
00:45:59,630 --> 00:46:04,190
Closed resource. Okay. Multiple choice matching.

414
00:46:04,190 --> 00:46:08,120
True falls. Short answer weeks one through six.

415
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:23,270
So for the modes of transmission, definitely be familiar with portals of entry and exit re familiarize yourself with the different routes of exposure.

416
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:29,960
I. I talked a good amount about particle sizes in particular,

417
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:39,080
so you'll definitely need to familiarize yourself with the differences in sizes between droplet and airborne particles,

418
00:46:41,270 --> 00:46:46,159
reproduction numbers versus incubation period.

419
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:50,030
What are the differences? What are the definitions?

420
00:46:50,510 --> 00:46:54,260
Definitely infectiousness versus contagiousness.

421
00:46:54,260 --> 00:47:00,620
Being able to differentiate and understand these concepts and apply them.

422
00:47:03,770 --> 00:47:07,580
Disinfection, decontamination and sterilization.

423
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:18,380
What's the what's the difference? Is there k principles of hand hygiene and vaccination?

424
00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:29,500
Population immunity principles or herd immunity?

425
00:47:38,050 --> 00:47:41,260
Briefly look over this stuff related to OSHA.

426
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:56,380
And then understand the deficit, how the definitions of the different levels of hierarchy of controls and what might properly go in each category.

427
00:47:56,710 --> 00:48:14,960
Okay. Be able to articulate how things in the epidemiological triad are related to one another and

428
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:23,750
all these different scenarios for environments in which infectious disease is proliferated.

429
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:32,720
Be able to discuss those. Okay.

430
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:49,650
Let's go to. The phases of emergency management, for sure.

431
00:48:53,540 --> 00:49:00,140
The differences in responsibilities between local, state and federal emergency response.

432
00:49:10,770 --> 00:49:14,400
We talked about the opioid case study.

433
00:49:15,030 --> 00:49:25,560
So familiarize yourself about kind of like why the opioid crisis came about here in the United States and what are the main issues that are ongoing.

434
00:49:31,330 --> 00:49:40,340
Not in like super duper detail that you have to memorize, like Fogarty International Center.

435
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:42,669
Like, what is that? No, that's not going to come up.

436
00:49:42,670 --> 00:49:50,250
But like some of the main players that we've talked about, CDC, you know, Department of Homeland Security.

437
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:59,410
Okay. Then you have a doctor bidding her his lecture.

438
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:21,670
I still have not received Dr. Commander Garza's PowerPoint, but the questions regarding public health service will be super basic.

439
00:50:21,790 --> 00:50:28,480
Okay. Regards to Dr. BIDDINGER, his lecture.

440
00:50:39,970 --> 00:50:45,080
We have the recording. Yeah, it's on Panopto.

441
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:49,280
Yeah. Mm hmm. Um.

442
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:59,519
What did you do? Yes, the zoom recording.

443
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:02,850
The Zoom recording. And so it's labeled on there, the one on the right, one with audio.

444
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:13,220
I don't think I asked anything from his, actually. Okay.

445
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:18,180
So naming conventions for infectious disease outbreaks.

446
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:25,250
Be able to properly identify what's proper, what's not proper, based on the W.H.O. recommendations.

447
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:35,510
Historical responses. What things have been done in the past that are big are being done now, right?

448
00:51:47,100 --> 00:52:05,380
Okay. See? Is. The health care tier's definitely be able to identify what level of response each can provide based on our discussion.

449
00:52:22,050 --> 00:52:26,620
Just basic information about your own ID. Okay.

450
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:42,210
Those countries. I do ask you a question from Dr. Rochelle to lecture about measures Egypt took during the COVID 19 pandemic.

451
00:52:45,570 --> 00:52:48,990
I do ask about, you know, the levels of racism.

452
00:52:49,500 --> 00:53:01,750
And then for you to identify an example that I give and what it's an example of in terms of biases and microaggressions.

453
00:53:01,770 --> 00:53:17,360
Okay. Then I ask you about the impacts of internalized and personally mediated racism on outcomes.

454
00:53:33,130 --> 00:53:39,940
I think I ask you about one of the hurricanes again I wrote this last weekend so know and then

455
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:47,679
and then social determinants of health of course and then and what is environmental justice,

456
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:59,050
essentially? I don't think there's anything on there that you will find purposely trying to, like, trip you up or trick you.

457
00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:05,380
Questions from the class about the content.

458
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:13,800
Okay. Oh, did you say it's like a short answer? Some short answers?

459
00:54:14,070 --> 00:54:17,550
Yeah. Yeah, but mostly multiple choice matching.

460
00:54:18,510 --> 00:54:21,630
True or false? So, yes.

461
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:25,830
So if we look at our schedule. Mm hmm.

462
00:54:28,620 --> 00:54:32,310
Here we are. We just finished with six. Can you believe?

463
00:54:33,990 --> 00:54:37,860
So Tuesday I will start another lecture.

464
00:54:37,860 --> 00:54:42,179
But it's going to be just for like the first 50 minutes.

465
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:48,630
And then at that point, I will leave the classroom because you have a mid-semester evaluation from the Center for

466
00:54:48,930 --> 00:54:55,050
Research on Learning and Teaching shall conduct focus groups with you all and report back to me.

467
00:54:55,980 --> 00:55:03,990
It's totally anonymous. So she and I will debrief and I'll get a report, but I won't say like anybody's names or anything like that.

468
00:55:03,990 --> 00:55:07,799
But again, since you're the first residential offering of this course,

469
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:15,900
but I actually also care about improving the class, so that helps me for future iterations of the course.

470
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:22,559
And then Thursday, we'll do Great Lakes studies, then you'll have fabric.

471
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:27,060
So we won't even meet on Tuesday. And then immediately on Thursday, you'll have your midterm.

472
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:31,850
Okay. Halfway there. Halfway there.

473
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:35,069
Then I want you to start brainstorming your final paper topic,

474
00:55:35,070 --> 00:55:45,320
but hopefully you've been doing that and then you'll have like many assignments coming up for turning in milestones for your final paper.

475
00:55:45,330 --> 00:55:49,319
Again, homework, 15%, quizzes 20%.

476
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:53,549
Your midterm is 20% of your grade, final papers 30%.

477
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:57,060
And participation is is 15% in the past.

478
00:55:57,060 --> 00:56:00,990
But can't believe time's flying by, don't you think?

479
00:56:02,430 --> 00:56:11,600
No, I don't think. I think it's already Fat Bear Week is because it's due on the 16th.

480
00:56:15,790 --> 00:56:21,440
I'm just trying to figure out. 216.

481
00:56:22,490 --> 00:56:26,150
Monday to Sunday. Yes. Yes.

482
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:29,900
I think most of your assignments are due on Sunday, unless I specify otherwise.

483
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:33,260
All righty.
