1
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:09,300
Okay. Welcome back, everybody. Hopefully, no one had encountered any problems uploading their assignments over the weekend.

2
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:14,520
I didn't get any emails about that. And I saw that the assignments were coming in.

3
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,670
So sounds like everything worked out pretty well.

4
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:29,430
Just a quick announcement that and this is on the schedule, but next week will be the exam exam one that will be open on October 3rd.

5
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:34,200
So one week from today and you'll have 24 hours to do it once you open it.

6
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:42,569
But it will be open for a week. So anywhere in there, if you can set aside, you know, 24 hours to focus on the exam,

7
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:46,860
not the full 24 hours, of course, but, you know, a few hours to work on the exam.

8
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:51,570
It'll be open book, open note. I think that's enough.

9
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:58,590
And again, don't share if you don't work together, it's an individual exam, but it will be open book, an open note.

10
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:06,600
So I think that's all I had for now. If you have any questions and I will need to move my office hours today because we have a faculty meeting,

11
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:13,650
so I'll probably move them till tomorrow at the same time, but I'll make an announcement about that on the campus site.

12
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:19,890
So any quick questions before we jump into the Dr. Goodrich's lecture?

13
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:25,459
There's no lecture on the third, right? Right. Yes.

14
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:30,980
Thank you. So for for the exam, I'm going to give you that full period of October 3rd.

15
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:34,340
Two, if you want to set that time aside to work on the exam, you can have that.

16
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:40,640
So I think that will be it as far as announcements go.

17
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:48,140
So today, we're really happy to have Dr. Jackie Goodrich here at for her guest lecturer of occupational toxicology.

18
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:55,640
Dr. Goodrich is a research associate professor of environmental health sciences here at the University of Michigan School of Public Health.

19
00:01:55,700 --> 00:02:03,430
Thank you for being here. Dr. Goodrich's research combines toxicology, epidemiology and epigenetics.

20
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:07,280
So we've talked about epigenetics in the cancer lectures.

21
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,109
So this will be a little bit I think there will be a little bit of talk about epigenetics in your talk today,

22
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:21,409
maybe some of your more interest in learning about how she brings Epidemiol epigenetics into her work.

23
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:25,160
You can look at her profile on the department website.

24
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:35,090
Yeah. So she studies how identifying environmental exposures and mechanisms that contribute to disease susceptibility at various life stages,

25
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:41,540
like in utero, early childhood and adulthood, which again we've talked about in the class a little bit already.

26
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:49,970
So how individual individuals can be differentially susceptible to toxicant exposures depending on their particular life stage.

27
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:59,510
Dr. Goodrich assesses the impact of exposures from the workplace or the broader environment on epigenetic medications like DNA methylation,

28
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:01,880
which we again talked about the Carcinogenesis lecture,

29
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:10,490
looking at epidemiological cohorts from around the globe to better understand disease risk from exposures and vulnerable life stages.

30
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:15,980
So if everyone could help me help help me welcome Dr. Goodrich to class.

31
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:20,989
We're really thankful that she's here to be able to talk about her occupational toxicology today.

32
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:25,290
So thank you. So.

33
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:34,720
Yeah, you. Yeah.

34
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:38,200
Yeah, it should be recorded. It will capture the screen, too. Thanks.

35
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:45,350
Well, I'm happy to be here. As John mentioned, I do I do work on children and workers.

36
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:51,229
So those seem like two super different groups, but they're both, you know, vulnerable for different reasons.

37
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:55,190
I think you've talked about, you know, children's health already and why that's a vulnerable life stage.

38
00:03:55,190 --> 00:04:01,910
But for workers, they're, you know, a group that we really need to care for because they have such they can have such higher exposure.

39
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:07,280
And constantly, you know, if you work somewhere where you're exposed to a particular hazardous chemical,

40
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,479
then you're exposed to that thing like at least 40 hours a week or you work.

41
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:19,190
So this is a really important group that we also have to consider in toxicology and and risk assessment and environmental policymaking.

42
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:27,829
So this will be pretty broad today. I will give one small example from my real research that we can talk about more if you guys have questions.

43
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:36,020
But this gives you know, it kind of follows the book chapter. It gives, you know, what occupational toxicology is kind of some brief history of it,

44
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:41,690
what the main routes we have to worry about of exposure are in most occupational cases,

45
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:46,610
looking at some of the diseases that we already know have been linked to occupations.

46
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,779
And then talking a little bit about the regulatory guidelines, if you're interested in that,

47
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:55,520
I know there's a lot more classes in our department that hit on that, especially in the IPH track.

48
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:58,370
You'll learn a lot about that later on if you're in that track.

49
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:04,070
And then we'll talk briefly about identifying strategies for protecting workers, which is the ultimate goal.

50
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:07,160
You know, either you can, of course, get rid of the hazardous substances,

51
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:11,120
but if not, there's other ways you can protect people that have to work with them.

52
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:20,590
So much like most of toxicology. Occupational health and toxicology is something people have really known is important for a long time,

53
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:24,550
even if there weren't regulations until the last half of a century.

54
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:36,310
So this is one example from someone who wrote a book way back in the 1500s that was basically about occupational health, in which this Jersey,

55
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:43,060
as Agricola said, there's no compensation, which should be thought great enough to equalize the extreme dangers to safety in life.

56
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:52,360
So, you know, even back then, you know, some working conditions obviously have been very hazardous over the history of human existence, really.

57
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:56,799
But there have been people, you know, thinking along these lines, we need to protect workers.

58
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,250
Nothing is is worthwhile if it's going to threaten somebody's life.

59
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:10,750
And then this is just. Another example of someone in the 1400s physician who pointed out, you know, certain groups,

60
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:17,020
metal workers, goldsmiths that had poisoning that they thought was linked to their job.

61
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,299
And in this case, it was from blood and mercury.

62
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:25,030
Two things that we've known have been toxic for a long time, but which people are still exposed to even in the workplace now.

63
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:31,450
And then this is another example from.

64
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:42,850
The 1600s, which was in some ways like the the first big book on occupational medicine that described a lot of different effects that people

65
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:49,570
thought were due to mining and working with chemicals and being a pharmacist and all these different jobs that might be hazardous.

66
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:58,900
But even so, as we'll get to later, a lot of the the regulations for these these jobs did not come about really until the late 1900s.

67
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:06,070
And so this is just one kind of cultural example of occupational toxicity.

68
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:13,840
So if any of you have seen the movie Alice in Wonderland has various versions, cartoon or the one was I think it was Johnny Depp.

69
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:17,499
Then there's a character called the The Mad Hatter, this guy here.

70
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:26,110
And that's actually based on something called Mad Hatter disease, which was a well-known disease that people who his own have had.

71
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:35,770
So in the 1700s and hundreds and even through some of the 1900s, if you made these certain kind of felt hats, he used a mercury based preservative.

72
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:39,879
And mercury is really is actually a metal is quite volatile.

73
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:47,230
So it can vaporize and you breathe it in. And the hatters that worked with this got this poisoning that was characterized by

74
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:51,760
like insomnia and kind of memory problems and being agitated and things like that,

75
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:58,390
all these neurological symptoms that made them seem like they were not doing mentally well.

76
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:01,420
And so that's what the Mad Hatter character is based off of.

77
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:10,390
So with those, you know, very small history in mind, what officially is occupational toxicology?

78
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:18,910
So this is where we apply toxicology. Everything you're learning in this class to understand and manage chemical and biological hazards at work.

79
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:24,090
So if any of you were in Ice Age or taking any other occupational health classes, this is,

80
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:29,470
you know, basically a subset of the broader occupational health and safety field.

81
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:37,060
So, you know, there's a lot of hazards people can encounter at the workplace. Some of them are, you know, things like injuries and stress and burnout.

82
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:42,999
So occupational toxicology is specifically, you know, the the agents they encounter that are hazardous,

83
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,840
looking at those, figuring out how to protect against them,

84
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:50,110
how to, you know, if necessary, if people have already been exposed,

85
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:53,890
maybe how to ameliorate some of the effects they might have had and things like that.

86
00:08:55,270 --> 00:09:02,290
But the ultimate goal, of course, would be to regulate or prevent exposures as much as possible if we know what the hazardous ones are.

87
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:12,240
And so within this field, you know, we integrate age, epidemiology, medicine and regulatory sciences as well.

88
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:21,820
And occupational toxicologist need to know not only what's happening in the workplace, but also if there's anything,

89
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:26,830
you know, outside of the workplace, too, that can make people more susceptible to the effects.

90
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:34,030
Because a lot of times, as you probably learned about already, different kinds of hazards can, you know,

91
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:42,759
be their effects can be modified by, you know, things like other exposures, age, sex, things like that.

92
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:51,790
So knowing like what all of someone's whole lifetime of exposures are can sometimes be important when you're trying to protect a worker population.

93
00:09:53,350 --> 00:10:00,340
So what workers do we need to protect and think about, you know, and we can think about this in the U.S. context, in the worldwide context.

94
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,520
So in the world, you know, this is in this this, I think is a few years old, but it should be fairly accurate.

95
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:12,340
What in the world, you know, 7 billion people do, of course, you know, about 2.2 billion people are too young to work.

96
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:17,620
Some people are too old to work. But the people that are working, you know, it's really around the world,

97
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:24,519
primarily agriculture and also, you know, services and industrial jobs and things like that, too.

98
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,440
But you can see, I guess I can use the mouse.

99
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:34,150
You can see that this big chunk of workers is agriculture and then services, which is a really broad category that encompasses a lot of things.

100
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:40,560
But when we think about the US, you know, it's quite different.

101
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:46,140
So this is on the left. These are the hours people work per week and on the right are how many people work.

102
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:49,860
So you can see, you know, we actually have the most people in government.

103
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:56,410
And we also have a lot in education and health services. And then we have a smaller number.

104
00:10:56,430 --> 00:11:03,630
And what are some of that? You know, often more hazardous occupations, manufacturing and construction, agriculture.

105
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:09,930
So those are a lot of the sectors that in occupational toxicology, we're often more worried about because,

106
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:14,580
you know, you're exposed to pesticides or chemicals in a factory or whatever the case is.

107
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,550
So even though there's a small amount of people here, this is what,

108
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:23,970
you know in the US we spend a lot of our time training for this field, trying to figure out how to protect these people.

109
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:29,100
But of course, in these other sectors, there are some hazards too, but not nearly as many.

110
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:40,250
So in terms of agriculture, a lot of agriculture workers in the U.S. and other places are you know,

111
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:45,020
they're not really they're not protected by like a union or something like that. Most of them, you know, they're often self employed.

112
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:52,250
They're often working, you know, with family members or community members in some farm that's been there for decades.

113
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:56,930
A lot of farms are smaller and they have a small amount of employees.

114
00:11:56,930 --> 00:12:00,140
So they don't necessarily put in like big programs to protect them.

115
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:03,990
And then their work time is can be pretty crazy too.

116
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:10,220
So, you know, during harvest season, you can be working, you know, tons and tons and tons of hours without many breaks.

117
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:16,150
And then there's also a lot of children, even in the U.S. that have been identified to work in agriculture.

118
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:21,080
So this is these are all important things. You know, you might think I'm an occupational toxicologist.

119
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:25,550
I'm just worried about pesticides. I'm going to go in and see if these pesticides impact these workers.

120
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:32,389
But these are things you need to think about, too. Like, what are the what are the what is life like for these workers?

121
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:37,190
Because it can also affect, you know, what they're exposed to and how it might impact them.

122
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:42,710
And also realizing that they might not have a lot of protections if they're working on small family farms.

123
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:51,280
So that's something that has to be considered. So just really broadly, when we're thinking about any exposure,

124
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:57,270
be it a biological toxin or a chemical that's in the occupational environment, you know,

125
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:07,640
we usually think about usually have some way to estimate exposure using exposure assessment and then that will give you,

126
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:14,690
you know, roughly what their true dose of exposure was, you know, what actually came in and impacted them.

127
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:23,450
So exposure assessment is our main tool really to quantify the intensity and the frequency of the duration of exposures where they came from.

128
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:26,600
And then this is a really important paradigm.

129
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:36,200
And probably the main takeaway thing for today's today's lecture is this exposure disease pathway and how it fits in to occupational toxicology.

130
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,040
And Will, we'll talk about different parts of this as we go along.

131
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:46,879
But, you know, dose is, you know, when somebody actually takes them, you know, what they're exposed to.

132
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,030
And this is impacted, of course, by the pesticide.

133
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:56,090
You know, how much was actually used for how long, you know how many days a week, how many hours per day, things like that.

134
00:13:57,050 --> 00:14:06,200
And then, you know, what you take in to the body could lead to some adverse health effect, but that can often take a long time to develop.

135
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:13,590
So a lot of times when we're doing work or surveillance, we want to think about something we can monitor, you know,

136
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:20,120
either monitoring the levels of exposure that are in their bodies, using urine samples or something like that, monitoring some,

137
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:26,059
if you know, you're looking for heart disease, maybe monitoring blood pressure and cholesterol levels as you go along,

138
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:33,080
something that will manifest before a big disease and then finding ways to help those workers so that they can possibly.

139
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:40,600
Become a healthy worker instead of eventually developing this, you know, this really bad disease from the workplace.

140
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:47,800
And then you have to think about lots and lots of modifying factors, other exposures that could be additive or synergistic.

141
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:51,100
You know, genetic susceptibility, age, gender, things like that.

142
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:55,180
And then, of course, on the regulatory side of things,

143
00:14:55,510 --> 00:15:02,709
we have occupational health standards and best practices like wearing personal protective equipment and things like

144
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:09,710
that that we always want to maximize so that even if you know you're going to be around a hazardous exposure,

145
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:13,690
reduce the amount that gets in to people as much as you can.

146
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:23,879
So in this class, of course, you know, you talk about baby and, you know, roots and exposure, metabolism and stuff like that.

147
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:27,540
So specifically for occupational, I mean, any rate of exposure is possible,

148
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:36,600
but the primary ones for most of the hazardous things we know about are inhalation and then also some dermal exposure as well.

149
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:43,680
So inhalation, there's just a lot of things in certain workplaces that you can inhale gases, fumes, vapors,

150
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:49,980
you know, a lot of particulates like in construction and things like that that we need to worry about.

151
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:55,650
And then there's there's some occupations where you can have dermal exposure from,

152
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:59,740
you know, airborne materials that are or liquids that land on your skin, you know.

153
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:05,140
And in theory, these are easier to protect against, you know, if you wear some kind of like even in our labs here,

154
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:12,569
we're supposed to always wear pants, close toed shoes and lab coats so that that way nothing will get on your skin.

155
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:17,700
You know, really, only your face is kind of exposed with goggles,

156
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:23,609
which were goggles do so in some ways, PPE, it can protect against a lot of general exposures.

157
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:27,599
But I actually work with firefighters and you know,

158
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:33,149
you think of firefighters where like these big suits and everything and even, you know, full of masks and everything.

159
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:38,640
And even after they come in from the job, sometimes they have this line of black grime along along their neck.

160
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:47,940
So there's still some exposure that can get in. So there's definitely room for improvement of PPE in certain job types to prevent their exposure.

161
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:52,709
And then infectious agents are, you know, a whole nother thing.

162
00:16:52,710 --> 00:17:00,860
If you work somewhere that has infectious agents, which going to be in the health care setting, too, you could inhale these particulates.

163
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:06,690
They could get on your skin and you could accidentally ingest them if you don't wash up properly afterwards.

164
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:13,890
And that for health care workers, things like accidental needle sticks are also hazards in.

165
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:20,399
Then for outdoor workers, things like fights can be hazards. You know, you can get if you work outside in the forest all the time, for instance,

166
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:25,080
in areas with Lyme disease, you know, that could be an occupational hazard for you, for example.

167
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:36,600
So we'll mostly talk about inhalation because there are a lot of known occupational diseases that basically come from some kind of inhaled exposure.

168
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:44,550
So these are important things to think about if you're evaluating something, all in relation exposures are not the same.

169
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:50,760
What impacts the actual dose that comes into the body has to do with, of course,

170
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:55,829
concentration, how much was in the air, but also what are the size of the particles?

171
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:59,280
You know, certain particles don't really get very deep into your lungs.

172
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:03,960
You know, if they're large enough, they kind of get stuck at the upper end of your respiratory tract.

173
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:08,910
And there, you know, they can be done away with from there.

174
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:16,770
But really small particles, especially things like PM 2.5 and stuff like that can get deep down and get embedded in your deep into your lungs.

175
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:22,950
Respiratory rate people, different ages people, different genders have different respiratory rates.

176
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:26,489
Obviously you're going to be breathing harder. If you're doing something that's physically demanding,

177
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:29,370
then you might worry that more of that particular matter than if you're just

178
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:32,610
kind of standing here like me and there's something in the air around you.

179
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:42,480
Tidal volume, how much you can actually take into your lungs, which varies a little bit from person to person, affects what exposure you can get.

180
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:51,360
And then, of course, the timing, the duration impacts that and also, you know, just other properties of the agent itself,

181
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:58,170
along with size and effectiveness of personal protective devices, is a big thing.

182
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:03,630
You know, in some jobs they were full of respirators. So that in theory should prevent any inhaled exposure.

183
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:11,879
But in most jobs, you really don't. So figuring out, are there certain kind of masks that can present prevent some of this or not?

184
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:15,450
And this is like a really big consideration in occupational.

185
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:25,170
Regulations and safety recommendations. So that's inhalation for dermal.

186
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:32,430
There are, of course, factors that impact dermal. Once again, you know, concentration where it's coming from,

187
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:41,610
something that can deposit from the air or that's in some solution that might splash on you how intact your skin is.

188
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:47,750
So the absorption rate of skin can vary like by person and unit by age and things like that.

189
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,660
When you're younger, your skin's kind of more elastic. When you're older, it gets a little drier and.

190
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,450
More likely to have little breaks in it. The region.

191
00:19:56,570 --> 00:20:02,060
The actual part of your skin that's exposed can impact how much you take and the surface area of that skin.

192
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:06,530
Whether or not you have skin disease or any kind of.

193
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:13,200
If you have any kind of club or anything like that, obviously more can get in the temperature when.

194
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:19,540
The area around you is warmer than the absorption rate is usually higher.

195
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:25,750
And what the talks can assume to, you know, some things just won't be able to get through skin,

196
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:32,230
but other things will depend on the size and whether it's hydrophilic and hydrophobic and stuff like that.

197
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:37,110
And then even whether or not there's other chemicals, you know,

198
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:44,140
you're being exposed to at the same time or even on your skin from some, you know, lotion or something can impact what gets absorbed.

199
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:51,040
And this is actually an area in toxicology that can be kind of hard to study.

200
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:57,800
So there are some models that have been developed, like with animals or with in vitro, you know,

201
00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:05,020
basically like skin on a on a cell culture plate that can be used to try to estimate like what gets through,

202
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:10,690
but it doesn't perfect perfectly showcase what, you know, real human skin is like.

203
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:13,960
So it's just kind of gives us an estimate of that. So what things can get through?

204
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:27,500
So now getting to the regulatory side of things there in occupational health and actually it's a little bit confusing.

205
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:34,450
There are a lot of different kinds of regulations and some of them are, you know, have power and some of them don't.

206
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:42,970
So occupational toxicologists really want to help to make these regulations as absolutely protective as possible.

207
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:48,220
But we have to work with the system, and sometimes it's slow to change, unfortunately.

208
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:54,970
But the only enforceable standards are the P l is the permissible, permissible exposure limits.

209
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:58,600
So these were set and called OSHA.

210
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:02,440
And, you know, they they have, you know, they're actual it's actually a law.

211
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:06,670
So they have powers and they have to be enforced.

212
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:15,309
But we only have them for about 500, which is still a lot 500 different occupational exposure is at the time.

213
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:23,350
And most of them were brought about in about the 1970s and haven't necessarily been updated since then.

214
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:29,530
So some of them have. Most of them haven't. So but this is the only part, you know, that we can legally enforce.

215
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:36,400
But there are also other agencies that make recommended limits that they can't make people enforce by laws.

216
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:42,190
But many industries, you know, if they're trying to be nice to their workers, will try to follow these.

217
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:47,469
So another organization in this case recommended exposure limits.

218
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:51,640
And these are updated more frequently and follow, you know, the new science.

219
00:22:51,970 --> 00:23:01,600
So, you know, oftentimes you see these are lower than the polls and they keep coming down over time as we as our science gets better and we realize,

220
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:07,960
you know, like, oh, this chemical is actually linked to cancer, you know, 30 years later like that, these these things get updated.

221
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:12,969
And then there is if you are in the you have to be in the program.

222
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:24,280
You probably learned a lot more about this. But there's also another organization, ACG, which stands for, I think, American College of Government.

223
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,450
I know that age is industrial hygienists, but this this is an interesting thing.

224
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:33,879
It's actually more like a private group that sets a tone and standards as well that are really

225
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:41,500
good and updated frequently and industries actually kind of buy in to use these standards.

226
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,770
So you have to subscribe to them to meet their updated standards.

227
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:51,980
I know that sounds very expensive, but so, you know, if your if you want to look for a good employer, you know,

228
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,910
at least find someone who says they're following the ACG standards because those are probably the best for most exposures.

229
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:03,880
But they base theirs on they call them threshold limit values and.

230
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:12,620
Also biological exposure indices. The threshold limit values are similar to the Orioles, but the biological exposure indices,

231
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:19,850
they actually use some markers of health that they sometimes measure instead of an exposure itself to kind of figure out,

232
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:28,000
okay, when is this person had too much exposure? Like if you start seeing this effect in somebody, then, you know, they need you know,

233
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:31,610
you need to change something in your process so people are less exposed.

234
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:43,440
So thinking about these different categories, the occupational exposure limits do not correspond to exposure levels with no health risk.

235
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:54,540
So even if we say, okay, these workers are allowed to be exposed to, you know, one microgram cubed of PM 2.5 per day or something like that.

236
00:24:55,080 --> 00:25:01,620
That doesn't mean that those workers well, that it's proven those workers will never have any health effects from that exposure.

237
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:05,160
Instead, they're usually based on some health outcome.

238
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:13,740
So clinical health outcome that you're protecting against. So, you know, there's always can be some risk even when people are below these limits.

239
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:20,070
So basically, these are what levels we've decided the probability of impaired health is acceptable.

240
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:25,440
So, you know, it's such a low chance you get cancer with this low exposure that this level of exposure is okay

241
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:31,050
kind of thing in what is acceptable is something that I think we're changing a lot over time.

242
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:39,299
You know, so now maybe it used to be cancer or a lung disease or something like huge that we'd say we're just protecting against that.

243
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:47,790
And now as time goes on, we're trying to protect against, you know, maybe more subclinical diseases and things like that, too, for these workers.

244
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:54,660
And I guess this builds upon that, too, to find an acceptable risk.

245
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:59,219
And if even figure out what it is, we have to know what the hazard is.

246
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:06,180
And then in toxicology, we have to figure out what the diseases and what's the pathway leading to that disease and at what dose.

247
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:11,910
So we really have to establish that in our field of toxicology before you can make any of these standards.

248
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:20,200
So some of these were in the book is obviously anything you have to memorize or anything like that.

249
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:26,979
But if you end up working, you know, for your internship or something like that with a certain worker population, you know,

250
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:33,100
these are things you can keep in mind or you can look up to know, okay, I know this group works with benzene is one of the hazards from that.

251
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:37,920
So there's actually a lot of occupational exposures which can lead to cancers.

252
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:41,910
This is an all inclusive list, but some of them are listed here.

253
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:53,589
You know, we know a lot of the big bad chemicals like benzene, asbestos, fluoride, even biological toxins like aflatoxin can lead to cancers.

254
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:59,050
And of course, things like UV radiation, which in certain jobs, if you work outside a lot, you might have an exposure to that.

255
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:06,640
And then even I'll talk about later. Firefighting as a whole job is linked to cancer as well.

256
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,980
We'll get more details on that later.

257
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:15,520
Then there have been quite a few big occupational exposures that we know are linked to neurological diseases of various kinds.

258
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:21,730
So we know that these certain types of insecticides inhibit cool and esterase and they can

259
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:26,920
lead to really severe effects if the exposure is too high and subtle effects if it's lowered.

260
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:34,330
And then there are certain chemicals, including pesticides, that we now pretty strongly think are linked to Parkinson's disease.

261
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:43,310
And there's things like mercury and acrylamide and hexane that can be linked to different types of neuropathies,

262
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:47,980
which just basically the death of your nerves.

263
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:54,629
As far as reproductive diseases, there's probably a lot more in here that we haven't discovered.

264
00:27:54,630 --> 00:28:01,110
And especially with infertility rates rising in the U.S. and around the world in the last many decades,

265
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:04,379
we think there's probably a lot of exposures out there that are contributing to that.

266
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:12,750
But there's a few that have been shown for sure with our evidence to lead to reproductive effects in males and females are both.

267
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:20,040
And so in some cases, you know, this could be if you had a high enough dose,

268
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:23,519
this could be something that's permanent, but it's oftentimes something that's reversible.

269
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:30,120
If you remove the exposure, especially for men, then their fertility can return in some cases.

270
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:37,560
And there's, of course, plenty of things that affect liver and kidney diseases as well, some of which are listed here.

271
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:43,050
You know, some of these things like arsenic is also a general population exposure to not just occupational,

272
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:52,540
but many of these are pretty occupational specific. Since we talked a lot about inhalation respiratory diseases is a big thing.

273
00:28:54,550 --> 00:29:03,880
This is in some ways. Occupational medicine was born based on respiratory diseases, things like coal, coal miners, you know, long black lung.

274
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:09,080
It was obviously a worker induced. Respiratory disease.

275
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:12,840
And you can see here, even this isn't current.

276
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:22,340
This is from 2005. But you can see that there are still destino a lot, but there are still deaths even now from some of these occupational diseases,

277
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:28,640
such as asbestos, which causes cancer, mesothelioma, silicosis.

278
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:37,640
Still coworkers pneumoconiosis. And basically a pneumoconiosis is that are caused by things other than what miners experience.

279
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:42,890
Mesothelioma that could be caused by asbestos or something else.

280
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:51,200
And then hypersensitivity reactions to which is usually more of a when somebody is particularly sensitive to a particular exposure.

281
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:56,300
So you can see the death rate per million working people is low.

282
00:29:56,450 --> 00:30:00,770
But, you know, these are still things that we want to protect against that could be preventable.

283
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:11,070
So using asbestos as an example, you know, those numbers on the previous slide were from the U.S. But around the world,

284
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:15,090
there's a lot of people that are exposed to asbestos still in the workplace,

285
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:22,770
possibly up to 125 million workers in various industries, even though it's going down here in the US.

286
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:30,779
And you can see in this chart we're basically showing the amount from 1910 to 2000,

287
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:36,569
the amount of asbestos used, which became popular in 1910, and suddenly it's shooting up.

288
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:43,469
But then in the 1970s, the US put regulations on it for workers and, and for products and things like that.

289
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:48,000
So you can see that the use of asbestos rapidly declined.

290
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:54,240
And going along with that, these numbers here are regulatory limits.

291
00:30:55,560 --> 00:31:00,330
The levels of asbestos we decided, you know, the patterns of permissible exposure limits.

292
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:07,229
We decided the words were dangerous. And you can see that that's gone down over time to, you know, the laws, worker health laws first came around.

293
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:10,110
They said, oh, this level of 12 is what's dangerous.

294
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:17,820
But as the science got better, you know, now the level of the permissible exposure level is one which is much lower.

295
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,190
And in theory, maybe that's even still toxic, but that's decrease over time to.

296
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:28,490
So what happens with something like asbestos?

297
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:37,940
So Festivus is a pretty gnarly fiber that when it gets into the lung, you can it's kind of hard to tell, but from this image.

298
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:42,739
But these long shafts here are the asbestos fibers.

299
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:46,270
And this is a macrophage in your lung that's trying to, you know,

300
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:49,549
make them like you would normally do with the toxin or something like that that gets in.

301
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:51,680
They're trying to get rid of it, but.

302
00:31:52,940 --> 00:32:00,130
What they end up doing is kind of inhaling the macrophage and your other immune cells as instead it can't really break them apart.

303
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:06,890
And you know, they're there since they're really sharp. So it ends up killing your cells in that way and you can't really get rid of it.

304
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:10,390
So it stays in your line. That's why eventually over time, you know,

305
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:19,219
all of this inflammation that keeps coming into their and it creates my state of stress and stuff like that will lead to cancer over many,

306
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:22,640
many years of this asbestos just residing in the lung.

307
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,730
And this is a little bit more that shows in a different way that mechanism of action.

308
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:38,549
You know, basically, once you're exposed, once the asbestos is down there Eric since it recruits a lot of inflammatory cells in this leads to chronic

309
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:46,620
inflammation and also iron mediated reactive oxidative stress and and macrophage mediated oxidative stress.

310
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:54,720
And eventually this leads to your mesothelioma glial cells becoming injured or sometimes killed too.

311
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:58,860
And ultimately some of them become malignant cells.

312
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:05,520
You know, you end up with mesothelioma, the cancer that is really hard to get rid of, but it takes a long, a long time for that to happen.

313
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,980
And then there's some data that shows that there are some you know, some synergy here.

314
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:21,940
For instance, with smoking, if someone was exposed to asbestos and they're a smoker, then your rate of cancer goes way up.

315
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:29,440
So you can see it. A relative risk of lung cancer, if you had both asbestos and smoking exposure, is, you know,

316
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:38,950
at least 50 times that of a completely unexposed person and expose asbestos only exposed person is, you know, about five times that.

317
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:43,540
So you can see that, you know, considering these factors together can be really important.

318
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:48,370
And it also shows that there are some modifiable factors that can protect people as well.

319
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:57,690
So those festivals is kind of, you know, an almost toxicology example.

320
00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:04,800
We've known for a while as dangerous businesses trying to protect workers that have that, too, around the world.

321
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:09,450
But something new, something new that people are just now realizing is.

322
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:15,440
Bad for health or maybe vice realize it. But we're getting more attention to now it's shift work.

323
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:20,359
So, you know, there's, of course, all kinds of different jobs, including, you know, in the medical field,

324
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:27,310
which some of us are linked to, that you have to perform shift work either all the time or for part of your work.

325
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:33,140
And now it's estimated at 22% of workers do some kind of shift work in that.

326
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:40,390
Many of them adapt, but in about 15% of them biologically don't adapt well to this shift work.

327
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,290
And I think the mechanisms are still being figured out.

328
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:50,829
But shift work has actually been linked to some cancers, which seems odd because it's not like a chemical exposure.

329
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:53,790
But you know what? It's what it's doing to the body and has been linked to cancers.

330
00:34:53,810 --> 00:34:58,390
Then of course, sleep disorders, cardiovascular disorders and things like that.

331
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:06,220
And this is just an example of, you know, biologically what shift work can do to you.

332
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:09,610
So shift work disrupts your normal circadian rhythm.

333
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:15,010
And this is an example of blood pressure, but a lot of your biological processes have circadian rhythms,

334
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:21,280
so you're supposed to have a dip in your sleep and then it goes back up.

335
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:24,710
Then you have this morning surge and then, you know,

336
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:30,690
you have this kind of normal pattern that you have for the rest of the day and things like cortisol show patterns like this, too.

337
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:40,229
But in this example, you know, this is like a nine shift worker at the bottom and then a shift worker at the top.

338
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:49,170
And it's it's you know, it's been shown that it's their pattern where you're supposed to start dipping down again, like doesn't necessarily happen.

339
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:54,690
So this can mean you're more you know, you're more elevated more of the time than you're supposed to be when you're a shift worker.

340
00:35:55,410 --> 00:36:02,720
And then as far as the regulation goes, the biological clock is actually really, really neat and really interesting.

341
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:09,870
But it has many moving parts and it's ultimately regulated by the SC and here,

342
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:15,810
which is the super charismatic nucleus, which is part of your hypothalamus and that part of the brain.

343
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:19,770
You know, there's you know, there's, of course, a lot that goes into this, like even at a molecular level.

344
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:29,580
But when the body first sees light, then these genes, this certain set of genes get turned off and others that get turned on,

345
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:36,210
which are in this family and they have another slight on it. They're often called the clock genes, but they have a bunch of different names.

346
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:41,639
But these sets of genes, you know, set into motion the circadian pattern in your health, you know,

347
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:47,250
changes in cortisol genes and blood pressure changes and lots of other things to get you ready for being either asleep or awake.

348
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:52,320
And it's supposed to have, you know, this nice pattern over the course of the regular day.

349
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:58,649
And a lot of things that are regulated here are, you know, when you're hungry,

350
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:02,760
you're kind of like feeding cycles when you feel awake and when you don't.

351
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:07,860
And then even within your individual tissues, like your liver and your muscle and your kidney,

352
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:15,000
they kind of have their own version of this this clock where their function changes a bit throughout, you know, day and night.

353
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:23,959
And interestingly, there is we know what all these genes are that change over time, over time.

354
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:27,650
These ones at the top are what people often call the clock genes.

355
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:34,100
They're known to have this big, dynamic, dynamic change throughout the day and regulate a lot of things downstream.

356
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:41,569
But for the interesting part for toxicologists is that some admin or the genes that regulate absorption,

357
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:47,390
distribution, metabolism and elimination of things that come into your body are regulated in this pathway, too.

358
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:53,030
So, you know, there's these are kind of the master regulators at the top.

359
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:59,629
Then they regulate another set of genes that regulate another set of genes.

360
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:06,170
But within those, some of these are phase one, two and three enzymes that help us get rid of toxic things you're exposed to.

361
00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:13,670
So. You know, this means that if you're doing some kind of shift work and exposed to some kind of chemical,

362
00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:21,950
then your pattern of what you controlling in your body to protect yourself, to metabolize against certain things might be lost.

363
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:26,660
So, you know, there might be some kind of synergy there in how those two things work together.

364
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:31,140
And this could possibly lead to some of the, you know, liver diseases and stuff like that for them.

365
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,540
Associated shipwreck. Oh, yes.

366
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:40,690
Because of the various studies that kind of link either light pollution or like blue light kind of stuff to similar disruptions.

367
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:44,440
I know the study design is probably difficult. Was that confounding?

368
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:47,930
But I mean, I've seen a lot of stuff like this nightshift work I was curious about. Yeah.

369
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:51,530
Like environmental or at the community level. That's a really great idea.

370
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:59,899
I know I there probably are I don't know all of them, but I know for light pollution that I've seen studies with like melatonin.

371
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:05,350
So, you know, it definitely messes with the melatonin cycle. So in theory, if it does that, it can impact a lot of those, too.

372
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:11,750
And then. Yeah. That would be something really good to look into because.

373
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:17,280
Yeah, blue light. It'll be interesting to see if if blue light is enough to turn on this whole pathway or

374
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:21,839
not know we know it can make it difficult for people to go to sleep and stuff like that.

375
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:26,540
But yeah, I'm going to link benefit to last season effects effects the clock genes.

376
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:30,350
Somebody probably has studied that because that's a good question. I don't know.

377
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:36,810
I'm just going to make a separate comment. Sorry. One thing we're going to talk about a lot of these phase one and phase two.

378
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:42,929
And we've talked about ad me in a previous lecture, they have talked about these metabolic enzymes, next lecture.

379
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:48,149
So this is a great kind of preview. And then also I just wanted to call back to the first lecture,

380
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:56,760
I think it was where I talked about the exposure zone and we talked about how we're trying to understand how all the exposures that one encounters

381
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:03,389
can can contribute to health outcomes and how some of the stuff that's included in the exposures almost seems kind of like not intuitive,

382
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:08,100
like, oh, what does that have to do? What does my shift work have to do with my exposure to a chemical?

383
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,800
Well, here's like a great example of how, you know,

384
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:16,650
your sort of social role in terms of like where you work and what type of work you do, whether it's shift work or not,

385
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:23,880
could have an impact on how your body's actually like metabolizing certain chemicals that you encounter on the job or, you know, in your environment.

386
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:26,520
So this exposure, something can seem so broad,

387
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:32,459
but you can kind of start to see how all of these factors interact with each other or potentially interact with each other.

388
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:36,660
So that the slide was a great example of that. So thanks. Thanks, John.

389
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:40,360
Let's go to. And the question.

390
00:40:46,290 --> 00:40:49,620
So this is, you know, a little a little bit more of the same.

391
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:57,929
But this is how circadian rhythm has been. Disruption has been linked to one disease in particular, and this has been done in workers.

392
00:40:57,930 --> 00:41:01,690
But also, I'm actually working with someone here at the school who's looking at this and teenagers,

393
00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:09,780
since they have kind of a disrupted circadian rhythm just because of their age or because of their social patterns, maybe.

394
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:13,469
But there are you know, it's been linked to a lot of diseases,

395
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:20,790
but how it's been shown to be linked to metabolic syndrome and which is kind of a precursor to a lot of cardiovascular complications,

396
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:33,030
is, of course, you have, you know, things like when when your light exposure actually happens, which can be impacted by shift work or social jetlag,

397
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:39,120
which is when you have a different schedule on the weekdays versus the weekends or overseas travel.

398
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:46,620
But then there's also these internal factors, what your actual ages, whether you're predisposed to some sleeping disorder,

399
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:50,970
what your genetics are, and these clock genes that impact this too.

400
00:41:51,660 --> 00:42:00,240
And then, you know, you have either a good circadian rhythm or you have one that's maybe happening too soon or too late.

401
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:08,400
And then either of those kinds of disruptions, you basically have due synchrony between, you know, what, your brain.

402
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:14,110
This trying to tell you to do and what's maybe happening in some of the clocks in your tissues,

403
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:18,910
such as your your liver, that would be one of those important for metabolic syndrome.

404
00:42:19,930 --> 00:42:26,770
And then you can also have some external due synchrony where, you know, maybe you're supposed to be sleeping, but your work instead in bright lights.

405
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:34,089
So that's not like how things are sinking up there. And then, you know, those genes that we talked about when this happens can be mis expressed.

406
00:42:34,090 --> 00:42:37,510
Your melatonin is is not being expressed in the right way.

407
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:45,489
Your cortisol is rising when it's not supposed to be. And then this can lead to poorer sleep, but also changes in your energy intake.

408
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:51,400
So your organs your organs might be acting differently and actually metabolizing differently than they should be.

409
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:56,320
And also your timing of eating and maybe what you eat can be different too.

410
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:01,480
So that kind of that's there can be some bad synergy there.

411
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:08,350
And basically you end up with metabolic derangement where your appetite hormones are regulated in the right way.

412
00:43:08,350 --> 00:43:14,079
You can develop insulin resistance and dyslipidemia and other things that we're all impacted by,

413
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:21,040
basically these external and biological factors, all because of just disrupted clocks.

414
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:23,529
So if you have something else in in your life,

415
00:43:23,530 --> 00:43:28,150
in your job that's impacting and of these pathways do that can make this risk, you know, even worse of course.

416
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:39,550
So now I'm just going to talk a little bit about how as toxicologists, we can evaluate some of these hazards.

417
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:43,240
There's lots of ways to do this, and this is just really broad overview.

418
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:50,499
But as toxicologists, you know, in general, but also for occupation, we have different models we can use.

419
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:56,620
We can do in silico modeling where we computationally kind of figure out what we think this exposure will do.

420
00:43:56,980 --> 00:44:01,570
We have in vitro models, for instance, for skin absorption models.

421
00:44:01,570 --> 00:44:08,620
You can, you know, expose a mouse to something every day for a couple of months to understand what hazards are.

422
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:14,290
But you also need to couple that with human data and see what what's actually happening in real humans, too.

423
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:20,410
Whenever you can experimentally treat humans, but you can observe humans who have already been exposed.

424
00:44:21,350 --> 00:44:25,190
And then you always you always need to think about the route of exposure.

425
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:28,640
Where is it coming from? What is it impacting?

426
00:44:28,850 --> 00:44:30,530
Is it most impacting the liver or the brain?

427
00:44:30,530 --> 00:44:36,380
Maybe all of your organs, depending on what it is, how is it being metabolized and then what kind of adverse effects are happening?

428
00:44:37,370 --> 00:44:47,900
So I'll just talk about one example of something I actually work on as I'm calling this a research action pipeline for firefighters.

429
00:44:48,290 --> 00:44:51,710
So firefighting is a little bit you know, it's a little bit different.

430
00:44:51,870 --> 00:44:55,220
You know, it's not like you're working in a chemical factory and you're exposed to one thing,

431
00:44:55,670 --> 00:44:59,150
but you're exposed to lots and lots of things every time you go to a fire.

432
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:04,340
And the frequency is is not stable.

433
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:06,440
You know, there might be in certain departments,

434
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:12,380
people might only have to respond to a fire once a week and other departments and maybe big cities, you're going to a fire every day.

435
00:45:12,950 --> 00:45:17,510
So the timing of exposure is not necessarily regular.

436
00:45:18,410 --> 00:45:25,460
But we know that when firefighters do go to a fire, that they're exposed to, obviously, you know, smoke, lots of ppm,

437
00:45:26,510 --> 00:45:31,280
even things like formaldehyde, like all kinds of chemicals can be in the air, especially depending on what's burning.

438
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:34,850
And, you know, apart from just the the actual chemicals,

439
00:45:34,850 --> 00:45:41,179
the flame retardant chemicals that are in everybody's couches and stuff now, the pages which are, you know,

440
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:46,850
the combustion byproducts, they also have shift work, lots of stress, you know,

441
00:45:46,850 --> 00:45:50,900
physical strain and heat exposure, too, which can compound some of these effects.

442
00:45:51,470 --> 00:45:59,330
And then even within the fire service, what your exact job type is can affect what you're exposed to of your wildland firefighters sometimes.

443
00:45:59,330 --> 00:46:05,780
Now, during the wildland season in California, you can be working outside for 10 hours a day, you know, like right next to a fire.

444
00:46:05,810 --> 00:46:10,270
And then even when you sleep at night, you're somewhere where you can still be breathing in that smoke, too.

445
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:17,030
So that's maybe much different than a structural fire firefighter who comes to a building like this, you know, maybe a couple of hours a week.

446
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:22,970
And even so, even with this wide range and exposures,

447
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:28,940
there have been some these are just two examples of studies that showed firefighters are at an increased risk for cancer.

448
00:46:29,570 --> 00:46:35,600
So a three city study in the U.S. increased risk for lung GI, kidney and mesothelioma cancers.

449
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:41,720
And then a couple of years later, a study in California firefighter saw increased risk for melanoma.

450
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:46,050
And cancers. Additional cancers listed here.

451
00:46:47,690 --> 00:46:55,669
And then when they broke it out by to look at some different racial and ethnic groups, there were certain cancers that were higher in nonwhite.

452
00:46:55,670 --> 00:47:00,560
In this case, it was mostly black and Hispanic firefighters compared to non-Hispanic white firefighters.

453
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:08,720
So there are some differences of susceptibility there as well that we need to consider to protect the most vulnerable worker whenever possible.

454
00:47:09,470 --> 00:47:18,950
And then there's not many female firefighters, but out of the ones that exist, there's been a really high risk of bladder cancer that has been shown.

455
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:24,740
And probably other cancers might be more elevated among women, too, but they haven't really been studied very well yet.

456
00:47:25,790 --> 00:47:33,350
So it's all of this in mine. I work with this group called the Firefighter Cancer Cohort Study that's based it with partners from all around the US.

457
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:38,640
And our goal is to since there is some evidence, but it was based on small studies and stuff like that.

458
00:47:39,110 --> 00:47:47,240
We wanted to establish a large prospective study of up to 10,000 firefighters from throughout the US from a diverse background.

459
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:51,919
We want to this this timeline is kind of just what we're doing so far.

460
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:57,860
But right now we have about 2000 people enrolled and we followed up some of them for about 2 to 4 years.

461
00:47:57,860 --> 00:48:03,350
But we ultimately want to follow them up for decades and see who develops cancer, but also in the meantime.

462
00:48:04,450 --> 00:48:10,870
Measuring the exposures they're taking into their body and try to figure out which ones are hazardous and what can we do to prevent that.

463
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:14,169
And on the research side of things, this is really busy,

464
00:48:14,170 --> 00:48:20,559
but we're basically looking at all of these things and this is something that I think can be important in any occupational

465
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:26,890
toxicology from measuring the exposures and trying to figure out what are the hazardous exposures they have.

466
00:48:28,150 --> 00:48:34,570
But we're also measuring biomarkers that affect because if they're going to develop cancer, it's not going to be for years or decades.

467
00:48:34,570 --> 00:48:38,469
And we don't want to wait until that time so we can measure biomarkers.

468
00:48:38,470 --> 00:48:42,580
And this is where epigenetics come in and measure, for instance,

469
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:51,399
DNA methylation biomarkers in blood and look for changes in regulation of genes that we know are important for cancer development later on.

470
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:58,389
Because we think as workers are exposed, these subtle things are changing in their biology over time that can lead to cancer,

471
00:48:58,390 --> 00:49:05,170
cardiovascular disease, big diseases later on. And if we find out what that is, we might be able to find interventions.

472
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:08,620
Well, of course, we want to reduce their exposures as much as possible.

473
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:14,290
That's the best intervention. But there could also be for people who have already been exposed and it's kind of too late.

474
00:49:14,590 --> 00:49:19,959
Things we can do to change expression of these genes that oxidative stress,

475
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:25,840
certain diets and stuff like that, that would reduce their risk of going all the way to disease later on.

476
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:34,390
And I have some exciting news. Well, it's exciting, so said.

477
00:49:34,750 --> 00:49:41,170
So I worked with this agency in the summer, this summer called the International Agency for Research on Cancer.

478
00:49:41,170 --> 00:49:45,850
And they're actually part of the WHO. And this is an agency that they do a lot of things.

479
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:51,370
But one of their aims is to take all the science that's out there and evaluate

480
00:49:51,850 --> 00:49:55,210
certain environmental factors and decide if they're carcinogenic or not.

481
00:49:55,390 --> 00:50:02,220
So they have this really strict process for evaluating things so that they're very well trusted around the world.

482
00:50:02,230 --> 00:50:06,730
Their recommendations are, you know, believed by a lot of regulatory bodies and stuff like that.

483
00:50:06,730 --> 00:50:16,180
And they put out these monographs and put on a couple every year that take all this evidence and decide if something is is carcinogenic or not.

484
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:22,750
And, you know, usually they do single chemicals like things like benzene and ppm and pages and stuff like that.

485
00:50:23,110 --> 00:50:27,820
But in this case, they evaluated firefighting as an entire occupation.

486
00:50:28,990 --> 00:50:35,110
And I worked with them with about 30 other people this summer, too.

487
00:50:35,110 --> 00:50:41,799
And we evaluated evidence from using any human studies on the topic and the animal studies and then mechanistic studies,

488
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:45,100
which can be in vitro and things like that, or it can actually be in humans.

489
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:48,730
And we weight all these in different ways to decide.

490
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:53,850
What's the evidence? Is the evidence how is it human studies, animals and mechanistic.

491
00:50:53,850 --> 00:50:59,640
And then there's an overall rating scale where you decide benefits, carcinogenic or not execute categories that can fall in.

492
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:04,950
Oh, this was in France, so it was fun, fun to go there. But this is my group.

493
00:51:05,130 --> 00:51:10,860
A few of them had to be online, unfortunately, but I was part of a group that evaluated the mechanistic evidence.

494
00:51:11,010 --> 00:51:14,310
So we looked at things like we decided, for instance, that.

495
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:21,920
Firefighting. There was enough evidence from many different types of studies that it leads to epigenetic changes,

496
00:51:21,930 --> 00:51:26,590
it leads to oxidative stress, that leads to inflammation. And all of these are considered mechanisms of cancer.

497
00:51:28,650 --> 00:51:36,120
And then the epidemiologic team evaluated hundreds of studies that looked at cancer in firefighters, and there actually weren't.

498
00:51:36,540 --> 00:51:41,430
This is unusual for toxicology, but there weren't actually any animal studies whatsoever.

499
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:47,429
But that's all except for one one study. They brought a mouse in a cage to a fire.

500
00:51:47,430 --> 00:51:50,639
And after they put it out, well, they were kind of cleaning up the building.

501
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:54,930
And they had. And that was like a firefighter being in the cleanup, they call it overall.

502
00:51:55,980 --> 00:52:01,650
But you can see why it would normally be not very practical to have a mouse model of pheromone exposure.

503
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:07,170
But so all of our evidence was based on human and kind of lab individuals.

504
00:52:08,130 --> 00:52:16,050
And the ultimate recommendation that we came up with that was released in July was that firefighting is a group one carcinogen.

505
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:23,100
So that's the worst rating that you can get. That means that we think there's enough evidence that it causes cancer.

506
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:30,900
And, you know, this was based on strong evidence for several mechanisms of cancer.

507
00:52:31,170 --> 00:52:39,420
And then also the knowledge that we know they're exposed to a lot of specific hazards that have been known to cause cancer.

508
00:52:39,810 --> 00:52:42,840
And then here's the listing of the actual cancers.

509
00:52:43,470 --> 00:52:47,310
There was the best evidence for actually mesothelioma and bladder cancer.

510
00:52:47,310 --> 00:52:54,390
And then there's also some evidence for colon, prostate, testicular melanoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cancers.

511
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:59,760
And it might also cause other cancers, too, but that we just don't have enough evidence yet to show that.

512
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:09,059
But I thought, you know, this is very mixed, of course, to come to this conclusion because it's not like an individual chemical.

513
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:11,620
Or you can just say, like, okay, let's face it was something else, you know,

514
00:53:11,670 --> 00:53:16,559
less hazardous or let's get some better PPE in the factory or something like that.

515
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:22,350
You know, this is a job that we can't get rid of, you know, as long as there's unfortunately always going to be fires.

516
00:53:22,350 --> 00:53:29,760
And now there's more wildfires over time, too. So we need firefighters and we need people in this important profession.

517
00:53:30,090 --> 00:53:34,919
But I think the firefighters that I work with have been hopeful because they said,

518
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:38,960
you know, we know as workers in this field, we know that firefighting causes cancer.

519
00:53:38,970 --> 00:53:42,390
Like we already know that from just our lived experience.

520
00:53:42,990 --> 00:53:46,870
But now that the evidence is out there in a worldwide scale, you know,

521
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:51,720
maybe regulators, not occupational health regulators will take it more seriously.

522
00:53:52,140 --> 00:54:02,830
And, you know, trying to develop you know, now there's people trying to develop better PPE and better practices and, you know, some screening methods.

523
00:54:02,830 --> 00:54:06,150
So you can try to screen people early on for cancers and stuff like that.

524
00:54:08,550 --> 00:54:10,680
And I guess that's what I talked about here.

525
00:54:10,890 --> 00:54:17,640
You know, like at the at the very least, it can be used for worker's comp, which is kind of the worst case, worst case scenario.

526
00:54:17,650 --> 00:54:23,420
Now, if you're a firefighter and you get cancer. Well, that could be covered by the government or your department because, you know,

527
00:54:23,430 --> 00:54:26,880
we'll say it was an occupational disease, but that's not really what we want.

528
00:54:26,910 --> 00:54:30,059
We want to prevent these cancers instead. So I think, you know,

529
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:36,870
governments and regulators around the world will be trying to determine better practices and even from

530
00:54:36,870 --> 00:54:43,019
meeting with people from different fire departments in different countries like there's you know,

531
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:45,089
there's ways people do it differently elsewhere.

532
00:54:45,090 --> 00:54:50,400
You know, here in the U.S., for instance, our wildland firefighters are like right out by the big fire.

533
00:54:50,410 --> 00:54:52,040
But in Canada, you know,

534
00:54:52,110 --> 00:54:57,410
they do more of this airdrop thing where they drop things from an airplane and they don't have as many people close to the action.

535
00:54:57,420 --> 00:55:02,160
So, you know, there's different, you know, practices that could hopefully be implemented over time, too.

536
00:55:02,490 --> 00:55:07,379
There's even some robots being developed, you know, that can go in to a fire, do things.

537
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:12,750
But I think we're a ways away from that being implemented on a wide scale.

538
00:55:15,690 --> 00:55:20,580
So as far as just preventing exposure is something that's important is worker surveillance.

539
00:55:20,730 --> 00:55:27,120
So if you have a population like firefighters or something else that, you know, they have some hazards,

540
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:35,489
finding a way to screen them over time, you know, maybe in some jobs, they screen them for actual exposures.

541
00:55:35,490 --> 00:55:37,889
And if the level in their body is too high,

542
00:55:37,890 --> 00:55:44,850
they might actually have to take a break like work in the office or something like that for a couple of months until their internal dose goes down.

543
00:55:46,890 --> 00:55:52,280
But there's also just screening for health. You know, having a lot of jobs have a physical.

544
00:55:52,590 --> 00:55:56,750
You have to get checked out for all kinds of health outcomes, you know, once a year or something like that.

545
00:55:57,420 --> 00:56:00,890
And that's a period of time where you're starting to have some effects.

546
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:07,560
You know, maybe also you can have a break or put in some interventions that will protect the health of these workers.

547
00:56:08,850 --> 00:56:12,600
So you this kind of monitoring and surveillance can just be either exposure,

548
00:56:12,750 --> 00:56:17,399
you know, in measuring exposure in the actual environment where they work,

549
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:22,590
you know, like air monitoring or something or measuring internal dose from biological samples.

550
00:56:26,630 --> 00:56:35,750
So since I don't know if many of you will be going into worker's health or not, but whether or not you whether you are or not.

551
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:42,920
What do you think might be some important considerations that you were trying to put in a bio monitoring program for a population of,

552
00:56:43,070 --> 00:56:47,120
you know, say, some workers in the factory that were exposed to some chemicals?

553
00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:56,030
What are some things you might want to consider in your programs? Lifestyle factors.

554
00:56:56,030 --> 00:57:04,180
I mean, if you have a certain hobby where you sculpt with hot plastic, that might obviously impact your exposure and it might be a partner.

555
00:57:05,090 --> 00:57:12,680
Yeah, that's true. Because know, I think an extra exposure is I think it will also impact their health.

556
00:57:12,770 --> 00:57:15,940
The farm worker side of things, you also have to see it.

557
00:57:15,950 --> 00:57:17,120
What do you attribute it to?

558
00:57:17,540 --> 00:57:22,850
If someone's really high and everybody else is not, then it's probably not from the job, maybe from something else they do.

559
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:27,860
Yeah. I think the breath rate was interesting, like especially with the fire fighting.

560
00:57:27,860 --> 00:57:35,150
So like how much are they lifting in that industry and how much are they breathing like in relation to like what's in the air?

561
00:57:36,410 --> 00:57:43,879
Yeah. Yeah. And that's, that's possibly an area for intervention to, you know, if you try not to have a lot of physical strain,

562
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:47,570
at least not for a long time, like in the area with the most pollution.

563
00:58:01,310 --> 00:58:07,930
And of course, this is going to be a very. Very often, very job specific and things like that.

564
00:58:07,940 --> 00:58:11,200
But in the U.S., you know, you also have to be careful.

565
00:58:12,430 --> 00:58:16,960
If you ever work with a big employer. Sometimes a big employer doesn't necessarily.

566
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:23,080
What these bio monitoring programs, especially if it's not required by law, because, you know,

567
00:58:23,150 --> 00:58:27,290
you can tell their workers that they should stop working and different things like that.

568
00:58:27,290 --> 00:58:31,790
And actually for workers, sometimes they don't want to hear that either. They're like, I don't want to take three months off.

569
00:58:31,820 --> 00:58:35,570
Like I can't afford that or I like this job or whatever the case is.

570
00:58:35,570 --> 00:58:43,250
So I think there's a lot to consider too, like what the outcome will be if some if you see something bad in your bio monitoring program,

571
00:58:43,250 --> 00:58:46,760
like what happens next and how does that impact everybody involved?

572
00:58:51,190 --> 00:58:56,900
So that leads us to our summary bringing back to our paradigm here.

573
00:58:57,490 --> 00:59:01,580
You know, these again, for most of the toxicology you're going to talk about in this class,

574
00:59:01,690 --> 00:59:10,089
all this will be important, but especially in the case of workers, you know, we really need to think about dose.

575
00:59:10,090 --> 00:59:17,379
And they're they're very vulnerable, susceptible populations because they're just exposed to so much, you know, maybe 4 hours a week,

576
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:23,980
maybe more, depending on what they do sometimes to multiple hazardous things at once, sometimes to shift work at the same time.

577
00:59:24,730 --> 00:59:32,889
So you really need to think about how can we prevent as much of this where it's getting into people as we can through engineering controls,

578
00:59:32,890 --> 00:59:38,890
PPE, even changing the process so that you're you're using less of a hazardous substance.

579
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:45,490
But also once the dose, once the toxicant, the biological toxin is in, what do you do?

580
00:59:46,090 --> 00:59:51,640
Can we screen screen people for health and and try to keep them on a good health trajectory?

581
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:58,630
Can you survey for subclinical disease and then have some kind of interaction intervention to make people healthier,

582
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:03,920
to prevent these adverse health effects? You know, cancer, the big diseases at the end.

583
01:00:07,490 --> 01:00:13,200
I think that's it. So I'll take any any questions or if you have any questions for Sean, too.

584
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:18,200
We should be back in a second, but maybe you'll get a few minutes back today otherwise.

585
01:00:21,590 --> 01:00:28,760
Thanks. Yeah.

586
01:00:30,670 --> 01:00:38,650
Two questions like what are other group? One, just like in a broader picture, like what are group other group one occupations?

587
01:00:40,780 --> 01:00:43,270
That's a great question. I almost put a slide together on that.

588
01:00:43,570 --> 01:00:49,270
I know there's there actually haven't been a lot of occupations that have been evaluated as a whole.

589
01:00:49,540 --> 01:00:54,819
There have been a lot of exposures. So I know there's things like benzene and styrene.

590
01:00:54,820 --> 01:00:59,440
And tell you in our group one agents that we know certain occupations are exposed to.

591
01:01:00,130 --> 01:01:06,160
But as far as occupations. The couple that have been evaluated, I think.

592
01:01:06,870 --> 01:01:10,830
Minors like minors are a group one and then also.

593
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:16,050
There was somebody who tried a couple of years ago. They tried to do.

594
01:01:17,180 --> 01:01:21,590
Painters and welders, and I don't think they reached group one.

595
01:01:21,740 --> 01:01:24,979
But it might. But there wasn't actually like a lot of studies on those groups yet either.

596
01:01:24,980 --> 01:01:29,209
So they might reevaluate that in a couple of years. So they might have got like a group to rating.

597
01:01:29,210 --> 01:01:34,300
And then the shift workers were evaluated as a whole and they got a group to rating as well.

598
01:01:34,310 --> 01:01:37,070
But that's a really broad group of all kinds of different jobs.

599
01:01:37,850 --> 01:01:45,320
So I think it's more but we also we do know that there's a whole list of at least 100 chemicals that are group one on their own.

600
01:01:45,620 --> 01:01:51,950
So we know some in certain industries, you know, like, okay, the workers are exposed to a bunch of these group one chemicals.

601
01:01:52,670 --> 01:01:59,840
But yeah, but occupations like firefighting were kind of uniquely done on their own because you just don't,

602
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:03,500
you know, they're exposed to a lot of carcinogenic things, but it's different every day.

603
01:02:03,530 --> 01:02:08,060
So we kind of had to evaluate them, like in the job as opposed to just their exposure.

604
01:02:09,530 --> 01:02:12,560
And then my second question is like to your last point.

605
01:02:13,250 --> 01:02:20,299
So when you're I don't know if you're like in the recruitment process, but like when you come to these firefighters, it's like,

606
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:26,180
okay, you're group one, have all of these carcinogens and you're asking for information like what do you do to like assure them?

607
01:02:26,180 --> 01:02:29,990
Like, it's not for nothing, you know, like we're getting all this information.

608
01:02:30,590 --> 01:02:34,639
You might be like you experience, like how do you so participate in the study?

609
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:39,170
But also like because I feel like I feel like sometimes like you go in,

610
01:02:39,650 --> 01:02:45,080
you show something really bad and then it's like, what's the next part for, like, advocacy and like policy change?

611
01:02:45,710 --> 01:02:47,120
Yeah, that is a great question.

612
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:55,639
And we're really lucky in this in this project, we have a whole team that includes fire chiefs and people from something like nonprofit firefighter,

613
01:02:55,640 --> 01:03:02,000
organ and advocacy organizations that work with us so that we can implement we can translate everything better.

614
01:03:02,330 --> 01:03:07,850
And because yeah, I would've thought to like, Oh, this is terrible, we're just going to go tell them, you know, this causes cancer.

615
01:03:08,270 --> 01:03:14,239
But, you know, the fire for the fire partners that we work with have a lot of really great ideas about what to do next,

616
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:17,720
and we try to help them with that, too. So now some of them,

617
01:03:18,410 --> 01:03:23,540
we have some some side groups that are testing surveillance programs and even we're even

618
01:03:23,540 --> 01:03:28,790
testing an intervention that would reduce the exposures in your body through blood donation.

619
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:32,240
But so there's, you know, which is kind of an extreme intervention.

620
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:39,110
But and then there is, you know, we're working with some people are developing and testing better PPE.

621
01:03:39,530 --> 01:03:45,620
So I think it is very important to say like, okay, we established this link, now we're done like somebody else can figure it out.

622
01:03:45,620 --> 01:03:50,029
I think we're trying to team up with other people that will develop the interventions

623
01:03:50,030 --> 01:03:55,700
and the prevention measures and some of the federal partners are working on.

624
01:03:56,820 --> 01:04:01,020
Worker screening programs in the meantime, like worker health screening programs and stuff like that,

625
01:04:01,020 --> 01:04:06,150
which give you try to give you lifestyle interventions to to prevent just to make you healthier.

626
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:09,330
Things that would prevent cancer for anybody, for instance,

627
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:17,640
that they think in some ways the workers now take that more seriously, too, knowing that their job could be so hazardous.

628
01:04:17,970 --> 01:04:23,310
But that's definitely you definitely want to work, especially where people in public health, you know,

629
01:04:23,310 --> 01:04:27,750
you want to work towards solutions, not just putting this data out there and being like, okay, sorry.

630
01:04:28,290 --> 01:04:33,390
So it's very, very important to work closely with the people affected on the solutions to.

631
01:04:39,580 --> 01:04:43,320
You don't have to use prisoners like to fight fire sometimes.

632
01:04:43,990 --> 01:04:50,350
I think I heard that. No. Yeah, I think maybe where the wildfires are.

633
01:04:50,350 --> 01:04:53,469
Possibly. Oh, I have two prisoners. Oh, yeah.

634
01:04:53,470 --> 01:04:58,840
Yeah, of course. You see that a few times. I know. In California, I think it depends on, like, local units or even the state.

635
01:04:59,170 --> 01:05:08,530
Sometimes they will use prisoners, you know? Yeah. So that's a good vulnerability thing to think about to bring that up.

636
01:05:10,850 --> 01:05:18,000
And I think even for wildfires, like the evidence we used came almost entirely from structural firefighters, because that's, you know,

637
01:05:18,050 --> 01:05:26,390
historically there's been more of those workers and it's kind of hard to follow the wildfire people because their of how their seasons are.

638
01:05:26,390 --> 01:05:32,000
But that's something we still need more research on to, like how to protect the wildfire people specifically.

639
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,520
So I was kind of really interested actually in that.

640
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:44,650
So in the Carcinogenesis lectures, we talked about the ranking of of chemicals as one or whatever group of carcinogen.

641
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:51,480
I wasn't as familiar with the ranking of an occupation as a one, two, etc.

642
01:05:51,490 --> 01:05:55,050
So that's a pretty interesting process.

643
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:58,870
I just really hadn't given much thought to what question.

644
01:05:58,870 --> 01:06:06,549
I kind of, as I was thinking about it, came to my mind was do you did maybe, maybe less so in the firefighter case.

645
01:06:06,550 --> 01:06:11,110
But I'm thinking about do you know of these studies like ever encounter like a borderline

646
01:06:11,110 --> 01:06:15,700
case in terms of like whether you're going to include a cohort like for instance,

647
01:06:15,700 --> 01:06:21,459
like with minors, people that maybe, you know, spent a little bit of time in a mine or, you know,

648
01:06:21,460 --> 01:06:25,690
half their job is down in the mind in these exposures that half the job is somewhere else.

649
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:29,379
Like, is there ever a problem with like classification that you're aware of?

650
01:06:29,380 --> 01:06:33,459
You probably shouldn't run into that with firefighters, I'm guessing, because probably. Or maybe you did.

651
01:06:33,460 --> 01:06:36,790
I don't know. Yeah. Yeah. And so a quick comment.

652
01:06:36,790 --> 01:06:40,360
First, we actually use the same criteria as for individual chemicals.

653
01:06:40,370 --> 01:06:41,320
Okay. Yeah, that's what I was.

654
01:06:41,570 --> 01:06:47,229
But it was just like we could only study basically people who were firefighters could be included in what we're studying.

655
01:06:47,230 --> 01:06:54,670
But we did have we did have in some ways some issues with misclassification for more so firefighters can have their jobs.

656
01:06:54,850 --> 01:07:01,210
So sometimes they have sometimes they work at multiple fire departments and sometimes they work at a fire department and in construction or something,

657
01:07:01,780 --> 01:07:07,059
because they have these in certain states they like they work three days and they have four days off and they work three days.

658
01:07:07,060 --> 01:07:11,320
So some of some of them work something else and their four days off instead of just taking it up.

659
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:18,190
And those can be jobs with other exposures. But most studies don't capture that.

660
01:07:18,190 --> 01:07:26,140
They don't ask them a bunch of questions about their other jobs. So that was actually something that downgraded some of the evidence.

661
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:33,100
So we were surprised at first that we didn't have sufficient evidence to say firefighting causes lung cancer,

662
01:07:33,100 --> 01:07:37,420
for instance, which we thought like, well, you know, the breathing and all kind of stuff doesn't cause lung cancer.

663
01:07:38,140 --> 01:07:45,100
But there are a lot of studies that showed a link with lung cancer, but we couldn't really rule out based on how the studies were designed.

664
01:07:45,100 --> 01:07:52,239
We can rule out confounding by other exposures or smoking history or certain other things.

665
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:55,810
So because of that, that one had like limited evidence instead.

666
01:07:56,470 --> 01:08:01,810
So I think at for some of these occupations that we evaluate, the evidence could be even stronger.

667
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:09,610
But we can't say for sure because we don't know what's. So I would say we the ratings are more on the cautious side, if anything.

668
01:08:09,610 --> 01:08:17,050
Like if we can't tell just something else in their life or their other job cause it, then usually the rating is down downgraded.

669
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:20,410
So it could actually be worse than what I says sometimes.

670
01:08:25,700 --> 01:08:34,999
I think I remember a talk a while back that I was at about firefighters because of their you know, in the firehouse.

671
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:38,010
They're like living like in really close quarters. Right.

672
01:08:38,030 --> 01:08:44,420
Like. And there was like a like a relatively like higher rate of certain, like sort of infections that can arise,

673
01:08:44,930 --> 01:08:49,910
like E.coli and things like that from like in situations where you have a lot of people all living together.

674
01:08:51,020 --> 01:08:54,319
I'm just I was seeing like some of the chemicals that might be of interest.

675
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:58,129
I'm thinking about like suppressed immune activity or, you know,

676
01:08:58,130 --> 01:09:04,700
immuno toxicity in response to like opportunistic pathogens that may be arising in these cases,

677
01:09:04,700 --> 01:09:10,549
you know, not the cancer situation, but um, well, I mean, pathogens can lead to cancer too in some cases.

678
01:09:10,550 --> 01:09:19,010
So yeah, it's just kind of interesting, like expose the P files, which is like, you know, seems to be an immuno toxicant and then you're exposed,

679
01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:25,879
you know, you're exposed to like E Coli or something and maybe you're, you're more susceptible, that type of situation.

680
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:30,620
I'd be interested to see if there's any kind of connection there. Yeah, you know, that's a great thought.

681
01:09:30,620 --> 01:09:34,159
And actually, I didn't talk about it here because it's it didn't go with the story,

682
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:38,790
but we're actually looking at p fast and immune toxicity and firefighters too.

683
01:09:38,790 --> 01:09:44,209
A Separately, as you know, a different outcome is concern. And part of our group has looked at COVID, you know,

684
01:09:44,210 --> 01:09:49,580
like common antibodies and stuff like that and shown that they are lower than expected for these people

685
01:09:49,580 --> 01:09:53,690
in the fire service that have which might be cause immunosuppression by some of their exposures.

686
01:09:54,230 --> 01:10:01,700
So we yeah, I think about like in the house to also then not only COVID but other an increased risk for other infectious diseases.

687
01:10:02,180 --> 01:10:07,810
Yeah, that could be important for I guess, any occupation where people have to live together and be in close quarters a lot.

688
01:10:07,820 --> 01:10:15,830
If you attacks skin the immune system and you're around, you know, a lot of infectious people, possibly that's something important.

689
01:10:15,830 --> 01:10:19,490
I don't think we usually regulate too much the activation of all.

690
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:27,970
That's important. Well, thanks again.

691
01:10:28,630 --> 01:10:41,010
One, one. Oh, yes. I was thinking of getting firefighters, I suppose, when they are called for an emergency fire.

692
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:57,160
There are some places where my maybe radiation comes over, some material that emits radiation or something.

693
01:10:57,910 --> 01:10:59,620
They're very far ideas.

694
01:11:00,160 --> 01:11:12,130
I mean, the statistics that you have about the occupational health for firefighters include radiation that might get radiation from some sources.

695
01:11:12,250 --> 01:11:17,770
Sometimes without knowing. Really? Yeah, that's a great question.

696
01:11:17,770 --> 01:11:21,470
And that's that's something that I don't think we haven't captured in our study.

697
01:11:21,490 --> 01:11:28,480
I know one group we've done some work with in Washington is trying to do a focused study on

698
01:11:28,780 --> 01:11:33,340
what electromagnetic magnetic radiation specifically that the group they're working with.

699
01:11:34,380 --> 01:11:36,840
Has more exposure to that. So they've actually been monitoring it.

700
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:42,720
But I think usually most of these studies haven't captured that because, you know, we kind of just market it like, oh, they're responding to a fire.

701
01:11:42,750 --> 01:11:52,049
You know, maybe there's a house, maybe his car, it was a forest fire. We don't always we don't capture a lot of details on where exactly it was.

702
01:11:52,050 --> 01:11:59,740
I mean, there's some. There's there's some studies of people who responded to huge disasters like suddenly.

703
01:12:00,730 --> 01:12:02,410
Nuclear disaster, for instance.

704
01:12:02,410 --> 01:12:08,620
But, you know, historically, but I think, you know, usually we don't capture most of much of that further due to the visits.

705
01:12:08,710 --> 01:12:12,970
That could be really important, even if it's infrequent, you know, if it's a high enough dose.

706
01:12:22,260 --> 01:12:26,320
Think we got everything. Thank you.

707
01:12:26,380 --> 01:12:30,360
Let's call. All right.

708
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:41,785
Well, thanks again. So if anyone has any questions, I'll be to the top minutes or.
