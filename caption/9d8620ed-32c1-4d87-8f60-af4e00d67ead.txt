1
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:08,160
Okay. All right.

2
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:15,890
Good morning, everybody. Morning. Right.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,159
Right. Okay. So I had posted some assignments last week.

4
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:28,140
And you all, most of you, I was going to talk about this today.

5
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:37,560
Many of you found this already, this kind of cheat for your. I say loosely a group project, which it is you will be presenting as a group.

6
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:40,760
This will be the week we come back from Thanksgiving.

7
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:50,850
So if you have not signed up for one of these cancer side effects, which will we'll have our lecture on cancer next week.

8
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:55,330
Make sure you do so that there's only one group left. That's okay.

9
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:58,600
I think it's one of the more interesting ones is the neutropenia.

10
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:05,640
Nobody signed up for that yet. Essentially what this will look like is you'll have your group.

11
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:10,980
I have some information down here on the different side effects.

12
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:20,700
Of course, you can use other resources to look up whatever you signed up for, but in no more than ten slides.

13
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:26,249
So most of you have five people. So I would say like two slides a person.

14
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:31,170
So this is how you can kind of divide it up so you can kind of do it independently,

15
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:36,209
then put your presentation together as a group to make sure that you cover all the

16
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:41,130
bases and then that there's no repetitive and everything is is covered there.

17
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:52,410
So I would say maybe about two slides per person and you just make sure you answer all of these questions as comprehensively as you can.

18
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:58,410
But while keeping it concise so you're going to discuss what is it and why does it happen?

19
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:00,570
So that's like two separate things.

20
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:10,229
What are the nutritional consequences that might have more than two slides word so you could define that appropriately and then really

21
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:18,810
focus on the nutrition therapies like what can we do in terms of MMT for patients that are experiencing specific side effects?

22
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:23,100
Pretty straightforward. I don't want this. This is should not be stressful.

23
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,830
Okay. Yes, it is doing as a group.

24
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:34,620
But I would say usually what we do in the past is groups just kind of split up what they want to address in that specific topic.

25
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:39,100
I would say two slides a person is is appropriate. Okay.

26
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:47,550
So you'll have about 10 minutes to present as a group. So you do have to actually be in class the day that we did these presentation.

27
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:51,480
So if there's any issues there, let me know. But that is the plan.

28
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:57,629
The group that does do neutropenia. If you have questions on that, let me know.

29
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:06,300
I also have the diet that we use in the hospital for our neutropenic patients that I can set you just for for reference there.

30
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:15,629
If anybody have any questions on this as a group, you'll submit just your PowerPoint slides where it could be a PDF.

31
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:19,260
That's that's essentially what you'll submit just one per group.

32
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:24,900
And then of course your presentation will, will count towards those points as well.

33
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:32,280
Okay, so we'll do it. Like I said, next Tuesday, we'll do our lecture on cancer.

34
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:38,040
I'm not going to get into these specific topics. Some actually, that's what you guys will be doing.

35
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,850
So you'll actually be giving kind of a lecture on those topics.

36
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:46,750
All right. Okay.

37
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:55,720
So today we're going to finish our little cardiovascular disease case study and then we'll do a kind of a more interactive.

38
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:03,710
Session four for hypertension, we call that sound.

39
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,139
So we left off with our case study looking at some PSA statements.

40
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:13,910
And you guys also had some some other ones that were works just fine as well.

41
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:23,330
So now so we've done excessive energy intake intakes of types of fat, inconsistent with needs that's too saturated fat.

42
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:34,010
Given that we have evidence from the diet recall of this patient consuming more than 15% calories from saturated fat and an elevated LDL,

43
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:44,090
and then I also did inadequate fiber intake. Some of you talked about physical inactivity or just excessive fat intake in general.

44
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:52,940
All of those would be fine as well. So if we wanted right at least two smart goals to think about what we just diagnosed with.

45
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:57,450
So remember, part of the problem with this patient was he was dying out a lot.

46
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:01,040
That could be a source of a lot of the excess calories and saturated fat.

47
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:06,979
So a goal could be maybe to dine out no more than two times per week for lunch.

48
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:12,260
So maybe passing a lunch and the other three days that he goes to work.

49
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:22,610
Given nutrition, education on sources of saturated fat and how to make healthful simple swaps to help him reduce his consumption,

50
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:25,640
because that is something we want to target specifically for this patient.

51
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:38,049
Also talking about increasing fiber consumption. So that would involve education as well and high fiber food sources with the goal of this patient.

52
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:42,850
Increasing consumption of fiber in the diet to at least 25 grams by the next encounter with the

53
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:50,700
dietitian consistently consume less than 10% of calories from saturated fat by the next encounter.

54
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:58,750
So three months away, this patient's going to have a goal of less than 10% of calories coming from saturated fat.

55
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:04,390
And you can have them track that maybe with the food diary or an app.

56
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:17,410
Okay. So this one, I think is also helpful. So we the goal is to reduce that LDL cholesterol with these different dietary interventions.

57
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:21,280
So it might be reasonable to see, you know, to track the LDL.

58
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:26,290
So maybe a 10% decrease over the next six months would be a reasonable goal.

59
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:31,839
And that can always be established, you know, between you, the patient, the cardiologist, what's realistic there.

60
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,730
But I think it is reasonable to monitor that and maybe have a goal for that as well.

61
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:42,060
Any questions on some of these schools?

62
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:53,360
Anybody have anything different they would want to prioritize as a goal if you could have a physical activity goal in here?

63
00:06:54,770 --> 00:07:01,700
It kind of just depends on what what you decide with the patient is most most important and what is a big priority for them.

64
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:07,840
Yeah. How much is reduced? Just don't drink soda.

65
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:12,580
Yeah. If that was a simple thing that you start small.

66
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:20,950
Yes. So it's that's like something you think would be really helpful to remove those excess calories from the soda.

67
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:26,200
Yeah, that could be. As opposed to simple stuff present at lunch.

68
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:34,690
Yeah, I think it's a lot of times it will be driven by talking to the patient, like what's important to them?

69
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:37,690
What do they think is feasible to do?

70
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:41,820
Yeah, just to get started. Yeah. Okay.

71
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:46,270
Nutrition interventions and appropriate nutrition therapy for those diagnoses.

72
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:55,720
When we talk about meals and snacks, we consider this patient to have an excessive energy intake.

73
00:07:56,590 --> 00:08:02,080
Based on what we estimate the intense need and what that diet history demonstrated.

74
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:09,450
So we could have a specific goal that we want to keep it under 2200 calories a day, fragile weight loss.

75
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:21,610
So when you're working on if you chose to do the hypertension case study because weight loss is is helpful with reducing hypertension

76
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:28,390
often that is a goal just like some degree of mild weight loss of our patients are hypertensive and they're overweight.

77
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:34,240
So what I typically recommend you do is calculate the energy needs for the patient as you normally would.

78
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,860
So if you do the math, use an activity factor that makes the most sense.

79
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:47,920
Or if you do cals per kilogram, do it as you normally would for for an adult patient that fits the description.

80
00:08:48,190 --> 00:09:00,040
And then from there, subtract 500 calories from that 500 calories a day in terms of a deficit would equate to in theory of how to week of weight loss.

81
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:03,400
Now, you could do 250 if you wanted to do it more gradually,

82
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:10,330
but I'd say 250 to 500 calorie subtracted from what you recently you estimate

83
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:15,100
20 would put them in a place that should promote some gradual weight loss.

84
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:21,610
Okay. So we'll have a calorie goal for this patient to promote gradual weight loss.

85
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:32,410
We'll have them track their intake at least three days per week so that we can kind of assess their progress, their decrease, saturated fat.

86
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:34,680
That was one of our diagnoses.

87
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:41,979
So we're going to have them recommend reduce intake of saturated fat by choosing leaner cuts of meat or choosing lower fat dairy products.

88
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:49,180
So looking at their diet ways that we look at the sources of saturated fat and see what types of things we could

89
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:59,470
swap in or swap out to reduce that saturated fat intake and increase intake of fiber foods to promote satiety,

90
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:06,190
also possibly help lower cholesterol so the fibers can help with weight loss

91
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:12,190
because it's usually how caloric the foods that are not calorically dense,

92
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:18,310
they're nutrient dense, but low calories. They also fiber fills up so it can help promote weight loss.

93
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:23,470
And we also know that especially soluble fiber can help lower cholesterol levels.

94
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,120
So we can have some specific recommendations there.

95
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:32,559
So this is kind of general increase intake of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes.

96
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,040
You could have more specific targets there if you wanted to.

97
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:44,070
Okay. So how can this patient translate the recommended dietary guidelines into food choices?

98
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,129
Usually this is what patients want to discuss.

99
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:52,050
Like, how do they actually do these interventions?

100
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:57,870
How are they going to implement them? And this is where I think dietitians can be really helpful.

101
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:01,770
So you can give them certain ideas of how to.

102
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:08,850
Usually what I'll do is start by looking at individual dietary intake, like what does a typical day look like for them?

103
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:17,610
And how can we make that with like small little changes at first, especially, what can we do to kind of improve that?

104
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:25,310
So there's just some ideas here in terms of maybe they have a bagel and cream cheese every morning.

105
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:29,870
Can we swap that with with oatmeal and maybe some fruit to increase fiber enough?

106
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:34,020
Sometimes people you have to be realistic.

107
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:40,739
Like if somebody may not want to do that or there may be certain things out there that are just like, no, I don't think I can do that.

108
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,630
But that's where that discussion comes from.

109
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:52,739
So maybe you do a sparkling water in place of soda, you know, so sometimes these can be a little bit of a stretch for some people.

110
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:57,719
But it is important to have that conversation because you do want to make the goals kind of achievable,

111
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:01,530
especially at first to get some some good buy in from the patient.

112
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:11,460
So these are just some ideas focusing on how to reduce overall calories, increase fiber and lower saturated fat intake.

113
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:18,450
Okay. And then what data would we collect for monitoring and evaluation?

114
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:28,140
However, we had a diagnosis for excessive energy intake from an intervention to reduce the energy intake to promote weight loss.

115
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:35,009
So we're going to make sure they consume no more than this 2200 calorie per day mark to promote weight loss.

116
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:39,900
And we would gather that from probably tracking data or a food diary.

117
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:47,520
Any time we want to have either increased energy or decreased energy, we do.

118
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,100
I would recommend you monitor the weight because that will be affected by their energy intake.

119
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:56,650
And that can tell us, are they are they meeting these targets?

120
00:12:56,670 --> 00:13:01,379
Maybe not. You know, sometimes people, if they're losing weight and building muscle weight changes and it's helpful.

121
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:08,640
But in general, whenever we have either a goal to increase or decrease energy intake,

122
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:16,260
we do want to monitor their weight and that can be often a sensitive marker of their energy intake.

123
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:20,460
And I have a specific goal of about 5% weight loss over six months here.

124
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:26,250
Increase fiber gradually to a goal of 25 grams per day.

125
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:35,130
You could you could put that more measurable in what is gradually mean maybe over the next four weeks or 12 weeks, whatever it may be.

126
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:46,010
And unless less than 10% of calories to come from saturated fat and a lot of this will be monitored from their food diary.

127
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:56,560
Anything else you guys would include on here? Yeah, I used to use it.

128
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:05,350
Yeah, you could if you had, if you were trained in taking those measurements and I didn't do that.

129
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:11,840
I usually have some version of his films.

130
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:15,430
Yeah, that usually doesn't help the conversation.

131
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:24,610
But. Yeah. Yeah. I'm one of those things I'll deal with.

132
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:37,750
Yeah, you could put that in your monitor, like the rechecked lipid panel, including LPL in six months to coincide with that goal.

133
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:46,330
That would be good to have there. Any other thoughts on this?

134
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:51,610
I know we kind of like talked about the role of saturated fat.

135
00:14:52,660 --> 00:15:00,190
Really, the the the scientific body or, you know, guidelines from the American Heart Association,

136
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:03,999
Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics still does kind of cling to this.

137
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,280
Less than 10% of calories come from saturated fats in our higher risk individuals.

138
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:15,460
So it is reasonable in those with an elevated risk that also have high LDL.

139
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:19,360
I think it's still a good intervention to limit saturated fat,

140
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:26,409
but maybe focusing on the food sources and not just the percentage of calories if we can move more towards, okay,

141
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:32,260
we're going to swap out these really kind of more overall unhealthy,

142
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:39,750
quote unquote unhealthy sources of saturated fat and not just this blanket, 10% of calories focus on that.

143
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:44,320
Those types of foods would be a good place to tend towards as well.

144
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:50,169
Yeah, I know you have that LDL cholesterol as a part of.

145
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:53,380
What would you do with that as an intervention as well?

146
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,090
Well, we have.

147
00:15:56,530 --> 00:16:10,030
The interventions that we have in terms of decreasing saturated fat, increasing soluble fiber, are there specifically in an attempt to lower the LDL?

148
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:18,760
So but I do think we should probably put something on here because I had that goal about maybe a 10%

149
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:24,790
reduction in LDL in six months to then recheck a lipid panel in six months to coincide with that.

150
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:30,460
But those interventions are specifically designed to hopefully lower the LDL.

151
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,280
Any other questions on this example? I'll post this.

152
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:47,089
So you guys have the the parts in blue, but also if you had other thoughts and you guys have some really good diagnoses as well.

153
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:53,210
So this is not like the end all be all for this case study. There's lots of different interventions we can have for this patient.

154
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:02,829
Okay. So what we're going to do is, unfortunately, I'm going to have to have you guys shift a little bit.

155
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:06,370
So we're going to have like three groups if possible.

156
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:19,980
So if you can get in like three pods somewhat, we're going to do a jeopardy game for hypertension is you change it up a little better.

157
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:26,080
You might be in your pods, three pods.

158
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:30,960
Pick one person to be your spokesperson.

159
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:46,890
Let me give you a second to get organized, too.

160
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:58,870
I don't have any suggestions.

161
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:14,710
I know I have. It is very easy to say, well, okay, do we have our teams?

162
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:20,680
This is team one. Team two, where does three?

163
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:27,130
Okay, so who is your spokesperson?

164
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:32,200
Can we get a team to.

165
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:44,390
Team three. Okay. So how this will work is we're going to do three teams.

166
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:52,790
You have your topics here at Jeopardy as they start to read the solution.

167
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:59,370
If your team just I would say just your spokesperson should raise your hand.

168
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:01,280
So I can just see the one hand.

169
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:09,050
But if somebody on your team, like if you know the answer, let her know to raise her hand as soon as the first team raises their hand.

170
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:13,819
You'll have a chance to answer it and adjust your spokesperson.

171
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:19,280
You think you know events with your team, but then just at least give the answer.

172
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:24,440
A lot of these are there's could be multiple correct answers, unfortunately.

173
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:30,620
So I may accept some and then ask the rest of the teams to see if they have an additional response.

174
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:36,590
And then I will post the link to this so you guys can kind of use it as flash cards.

175
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:41,080
Did everybody watch the last recorded lecture? Okay, good.

176
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:47,990
Did you do the reading? Okay, so it's taken literally directly from that.

177
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:56,600
So this is always interesting when you do this each year because it tells me that the readings are not being done, but we'll see.

178
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,720
So again, a lot of these have multiple answers potentially.

179
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:07,040
So if you get it kind of partially right, well, we'll give another team a chance.

180
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:12,830
Okay. So let's see what happens. Okay. Let's start with the team one.

181
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:16,790
Can we you can get us started. These are your categories up here.

182
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:29,510
We'll do a dash diet for 200. The Dash diet focuses on increasing intake of potassium fiber and this.

183
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:37,160
So I would say that is partially correct for team two.

184
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:41,830
She said magnesium. What is that?

185
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:51,589
I was telling and I don't know anybody see who had it first we'll go.

186
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:59,299
Abby will have calcium, I'll say.

187
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,750
Yes, that is correct. Okay.

188
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,790
So big component of the dash diet.

189
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:14,479
We increase potassium fiber when we're not nutrients and calcium also magnesium is increased by following this diet.

190
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:20,030
So both of those are correct. So so we're going to do.

191
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:24,919
Okay. So let's go back to two things.

192
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:29,570
You got the first part correct. I really want.

193
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:47,700
Risk factors are different. 300 blood pressure is the product of this and total systemic vascular resistance.

194
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:55,340
T2 is. Yes, that's very good.

195
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:03,799
Okay. So that is from that recorded lecture. Blood pressure is very complex.

196
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:07,400
So. Just have that.

197
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:10,300
You know, I try to break down what each of these things are.

198
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:18,220
Just have kind of a general idea of what is regulating our blood pressure and what is it really measuring.

199
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:23,860
So some of this is a little bit even this I think it's a little bit beyond the scope of this class.

200
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:28,770
But we we do discuss it in that lecture. Okay.

201
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:39,999
Thank you. All right.

202
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:47,200
Let's look at medical management for three of these.

203
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,910
Three dietary factors are specifically associated with hypertension risk.

204
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:06,970
To my right. I do want to say I have increase saturated fat.

205
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:12,130
What is increasing? What is high sodium?

206
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:20,620
What is low fiber? I would say that's good, especially two of the three.

207
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:28,390
Does anybody want to add that? Yes, I think that's okay, too.

208
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:32,440
There is some one other component that is a risk.

209
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:42,390
It's not as. Clearly an independent risk, but it is associated with high potential risk in terms of a dietary feature.

210
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:51,900
We talked about high saturated fat, high sodium, low fiber, high cholesterol because.

211
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:57,110
No. This one's kind of hard.

212
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:02,030
We'll give it to team one. What is about red meat?

213
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,060
Yeah, that's.

214
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:20,510
I think that's part of the dash diet, but really excessive alcohol intake at that one and also low potassium into an increased risk for hypertension.

215
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:27,110
That's that's the one that's not it's easy to like find that independent association.

216
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:31,270
Alcohol definitely a part of the motive for hypertension.

217
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:34,700
We do see especially among more heavy drinkers.

218
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:40,490
Reduction or elimination of alcohol can have a pretty significant effect on blood pressure.

219
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:50,910
Yes, they drinking as part of their life socially to follow those guidelines, but no more than this per week or lower.

220
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:57,290
Um. It depends on if they. It depends on how their hypertension has been diagnosed.

221
00:24:57,290 --> 00:25:01,909
So like primary hypertension sometimes referred to as essential.

222
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:06,050
Hypertension usually is multifactorial.

223
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:15,080
So that type of patient may be could benefit from moderate alcohol like if they were a heavy drinker, definitely reducing to more of a moderate level.

224
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:27,620
Other people, if they have what's more like secondary hypertension, so it's caused by a kidney disease, they might benefit more from strict avoidance.

225
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:35,540
So but there's probably a place there's always a room to cut down to more moderate levels that have shown to be more protected in heart disease.

226
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:42,649
But for hypertension in particular, alcohol can be can increase risk.

227
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:46,100
Definitely. Okay.

228
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:49,820
I think we gave that to team one. So go ahead.

229
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:57,920
Let's see. HP Envy six for 389.

230
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:02,470
This constitutes elevated levels.

231
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:07,580
All right. Do you want to start? Yes.

232
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:15,100
Okay. So elevator $129 and then less than.

233
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:20,370
And than. Yes. And so to a elevated blood pressure.

234
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:31,370
Now, these changed a couple of years ago. Elevated blood pressure is systolic of 120 to 129 and a diastolic less than 80.

235
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:38,840
So when you look at the different categories now in terms of normal elevated stage one, stage two, hypertension,

236
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:47,150
if there is a disparity in a category between the systolic and diastolic pressures, the higher value will determine the stage.

237
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:54,230
Yes, this is this is considered elevated blood pressure with those new cutoffs.

238
00:26:55,460 --> 00:27:15,200
Okay. People heading to. And the diet is of the reduction of sodium by this amount per day is still beneficial

239
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,460
if a patient cannot achieve the desired level of intake on the dash diet.

240
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:29,840
Yes. So it is no secret.

241
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:41,200
I mean, I don't know, two, one 500 milligrams a day clothes.

242
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:48,659
So this is this is from the book. But this is helpful in counseling if any time you work with people that are going

243
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:53,280
to do the death diet because we have very high sodium intakes in this country.

244
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:59,820
So sometimes getting down to that 2300 milligrams a day mark is not going to be feasible right away.

245
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:08,520
So studies have shown that reduction of a thousand milligrams a day can be really beneficial.

246
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:14,310
So even our patients, if they have really high sodium intake, going to 23 milligrams.

247
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:17,520
Right, it's just not going to be achievable right away.

248
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:24,120
But even a reduction of a thousand milligrams a day has shown to be very beneficial with blood pressure control.

249
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:28,859
So that's something you can kind of take as as you go into two counseling.

250
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:35,460
Okay. We might not get right to that goal, but even this reduction can be really helpful and that might be more achievable for the patient.

251
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:44,790
Okay. We'll get back to you again.

252
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:57,410
That's 4.4. This term describes the force exerted during relaxation of the ventricles.

253
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:09,139
Take three. Yes, this is this is diastolic blood pressure.

254
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:18,620
So the bottom number, when the body's in diastole that's measuring the force exerted is when the blood vessels are relaxed.

255
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:23,360
So that's diastolic blood pressure. Okay.

256
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:42,260
Teams are. Right now, it's little bit more.

257
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:50,300
This is now considered stage one hypertension.

258
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:57,340
Three systolic blood pressure for any time.

259
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:03,090
Yes. Yes. Okay.

260
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:09,180
You guys don't have to know. Obviously, if you're a case study, you're going to have access to the new guidelines.

261
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:14,220
This is just kind of hammering home that these these cut points are a little bit different.

262
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:18,990
Now, there are a couple of years old, but understanding the different stages here.

263
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:25,480
Great. Okay. Team three to.

264
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:36,260
Okay. That's amazing.

265
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:44,660
Do I think this terms describes the force t one?

266
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:53,390
What is the solid? Systolic. Yes. So this is the force exerted on the walls of the blood vessels during contraction.

267
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:56,900
That's the top number. Systolic blood pressure.

268
00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:06,350
And it's going to be higher than the diastolic team one.

269
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:19,950
Dash diet for 303. Nutrition counseling for sodium restricted diet should include instruction and the following.

270
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:24,120
So give me two examples of where you might start when you're instructing or counseling your patient

271
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:36,960
on a sodium restrictive diet team while reducing processed foods and reducing the analysis leading.

272
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:48,030
Okay. So, yes, so she said so this is basically like we have to counselor patient on a sodium restricted diet where we

273
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:54,570
start so processed food intake how to reduce that and also maybe tips for dining out to reduce sodium.

274
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:03,149
What are the most common sources of sodium in people's diet, processed foods and usually restaurant meals.

275
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:06,660
So those are a good place to start the labels think of. Yeah.

276
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:11,400
So just like increasing cause.

277
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:21,360
Yeah, sure. Like giving some specific ways of foods that would be naturally low in sodium that would then maybe replace some that are high.

278
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:27,270
Yeah. Maybe using other seasonings like pepper lake, salt freezes and.

279
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:28,920
Yeah, that's great.

280
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:41,129
So and I have a whole hand out on canvas that one of our dietitians made in terms of herbs and seasonings way to flavor foods without adding salt.

281
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:44,760
So that's another good, good idea.

282
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:48,780
What else might be helpful? Like, just very basic.

283
00:32:49,380 --> 00:33:00,780
I'll give you guys this place, I think. Label reading potentially could be part of that counseling or educational session.

284
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:06,540
Where to find. Most people have seen a food label that maybe they haven't paid attention.

285
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:14,490
So minimally processed foods, reading food labels for sodium content, avoiding adding salt.

286
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:22,740
So sometimes that's one of the first things will say is like, okay, just don't add additional salt during the cooking process.

287
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:28,650
And then we talked about alternatives for flavorings. So many potential answers there.

288
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:40,010
All right, team one. When I started.

289
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:47,330
Before I did. Consuming a diet rich in this has shown to lower blood pressure.

290
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:51,320
Too much potassium. Yeah.

291
00:33:51,350 --> 00:34:06,270
So part of why the dash diet is helpful is it not only lower sodium content, but it's very high in potassium, which can blunt the effects of sodium.

292
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:14,030
So when you now usually if a patient has a high sodium diet and increases their potassium intake,

293
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:19,250
that's where we could see the most benefit once they're already on a low sodium diet.

294
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:28,490
Increasing potassium is still helpful, but we don't see as big of an effect there because the sodium content very low.

295
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:38,870
But this is part of the reason why the dash has been so effective, we think is is partly because of the very high potassium.

296
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:55,370
And take two one what do dash I think the recommendation to consume twice the average recommended

297
00:34:55,370 --> 00:35:02,420
amount of these is one of the hallmarks of the dash diet team three fruits and vegetables.

298
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:10,070
Yeah so if you really look at the dash diet had or.

299
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:17,100
It is about twice the amount that we recommend for fruits or vegetables if we're looking at the dietary guidelines.

300
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:22,979
So it's essentially two or three servings per meal. That's why we get such a high fiber intake.

301
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:31,320
That's why we get such a high potassium intake on a dash diet is because of the very the big focus on increasing fruits and vegetables.

302
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:42,490
All right, team three. You.

303
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:54,730
The Dash diet focuses on reducing sodium intake, alcohol consumption and yes, saturated fats.

304
00:35:55,180 --> 00:36:01,600
Yes. So if you think about the components of the Dash diet, again,

305
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:07,990
you do get one that is ultimately pretty low in total fat, but especially low in saturated fat.

306
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:13,100
Okay. That was two. Pay to do.

307
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:19,550
Yeah, let's do.

308
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:37,430
Risk factors for 500, hypertension tends to be more common more severe occur earlier in life and be associate what is.

309
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:48,210
No. I think it is in the African-American or black population.

310
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:59,490
So it may be higher in Hispanics as well, but it's the opposite as well.

311
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:05,490
So it could be probably compared to like the Caucasian population.

312
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:07,980
Hispanic rates might be higher.

313
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:18,630
But in persons who identify as black, especially in the U.S., we see that hypertension is more difficult to control, tends to be more severe,

314
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:23,729
does occur earlier in life and is associated with greater target organ damage,

315
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:30,510
meaning that it tends to really affect the kidneys in a more severe way in this population.

316
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:38,590
So there's this is multifactorial in terms of why we see this, but this would be a disparity.

317
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:39,900
So this is not just a different.

318
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:48,780
So if we look at global rates of hypertension in other countries, people who identify as black have similar rates to whites.

319
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:56,970
But it's African-American or black people living in America that sees as the biggest disparity here.

320
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,330
So there's lots of hypotheses why that is.

321
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:04,440
It's pretty complex, but this is definitely,

322
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:18,749
definitely seen a more severe and less responsive to more traditional hypertensive therapy, also potentially more salt sensitive.

323
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:25,730
So they the effects of sodium tend to be more intense in an African-American population.

324
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:30,750
So there's many reasons why we tend to see this.

325
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:38,220
And this will feed into next semester when we talk about chronic kidney disease and the different racial disparities we see there.

326
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:47,670
A lot of it has to do with the rates of hypertension in this population, but it could also be elevated in Hispanic populations as well.

327
00:38:51,960 --> 00:39:05,160
Okay. Team three. I think that's really what gives you the 400.

328
00:39:07,770 --> 00:39:13,380
This organ is both the contributing and the target organ of the hypertensive process.

329
00:39:15,210 --> 00:39:19,290
Oh, I think you seen too, but I was kind of looking this way.

330
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:23,880
What is the heart? No.

331
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:27,130
What did you think? What is the sadness?

332
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:32,070
Yes. In terms of the. So the heart does contribute to blood pressure.

333
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:36,360
So I would say I would give that the heart.

334
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:45,330
This is the best answer because the kidney is very involved in regulating blood pressure and then high blood pressure in turn, can damage the kidneys.

335
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:52,280
But the heart you think the heart is also involved in blood pressure in terms of contraction,

336
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:55,930
that people that are hypertensive are at increased risk for heart disease.

337
00:39:55,950 --> 00:39:58,370
So that's not a bad answer at all.

338
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:11,760
But the best answer would be the kidney because of the role it plays in regulating fluid balance, sodium excretion, dilation of the ventricles.

339
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:20,330
The kidneys are highly involved in that. And then again, that would be a target organ of the disease process where damage could occur.

340
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:26,880
Okay. Team one. Why do risk factors?

341
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:37,820
Murder 250. Excessive excretion of these two hormones can cause basal constriction and fluid retention,

342
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:51,800
which will both increase blood pressure to what is so k very close.

343
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:59,450
Angiotensin is correct. Renin is the enzyme that kind of is responsible for the release of that hormone.

344
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:06,200
So that's good. What else are we missing? Yeah.

345
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:12,120
More often than not, that can play a role.

346
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:22,490
But there's a better answer. Okay.

347
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:30,280
So. Vasopressin or you may also hear of anti diuretic hormone and angiotensin two.

348
00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:38,340
Okay, so vasopressin is also called Antidiabetic hormone or ADA.

349
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:45,490
It is. It increases the amount of soluble free water reabsorbed back into circulation from the kidneys,

350
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:50,890
which increases peripheral vascular resistance and raises blood pressure.

351
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:59,110
Angiotensin or angiotensin two is a peptide hormone that causes basal constriction and an increase in blood pressure.

352
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:04,660
So the vessels are the diameter is getting smaller.

353
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:07,929
It's going to be more difficult for blood to pass freely.

354
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:12,670
So that will raise blood pressure. So that right in aldosterone,

355
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:20,440
angiotensin system in the kidneys that kind of triggers responsive hormones that then can

356
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:25,660
raise or lower blood pressure and increased amounts of these will raise blood pressure.

357
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:37,230
Okay Team two since that was pretty good answer number two in that.

358
00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:48,200
Research trials limiting consumption to this amount of sodium per day was 1500.

359
00:42:48,210 --> 00:42:57,510
Yes. So if anybody is interested, those early dash clinical trials are quite interesting in terms of who was randomized to what diet.

360
00:42:57,810 --> 00:43:00,240
So they all saw an improvement. Right.

361
00:43:00,930 --> 00:43:10,650
But when the group that was randomized to 1500 milligrams a day as opposed to the 2300, they saw the biggest reduction in blood pressure.

362
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:18,060
Okay. So sometimes you will see even stricter sodium recommendations for patients.

363
00:43:19,110 --> 00:43:24,210
Do you guys is this easy to follow, do you think? It's it's hard.

364
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:30,240
So although we do see a really good benefit from that.

365
00:43:30,570 --> 00:43:35,190
Feasibility or long term compliance could be difficult.

366
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:45,330
All right. Time to slice down on Kitchen one and.

367
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:56,070
This is a known risk factor for hypertension, possibly because it impairs endothelial relaxation and vasodilation.

368
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:00,640
Team two What is smoking?

369
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:05,870
Yes. So this is a risk factor. Yes.

370
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:19,229
The smoking or the tobacco nicotine, the different carcinogens can impair the endothelial relaxation and limit basal dilation.

371
00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:24,990
So basically making the vessels more likely to be rigid and constricting.

372
00:44:25,350 --> 00:44:32,360
So that could then raise blood pressure. It's very close.

373
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:35,090
A very close. Okay. So go ahead. To.

374
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:50,660
Yes can see your medical and myself patient to name three lifestyle risk factors for hypertension other than diet and smoking.

375
00:44:51,890 --> 00:44:58,710
Two three. I have.

376
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:10,050
Okay. So you have two. Very good.

377
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:18,000
You'll get points for this. Does anybody want to round that out? So I would say alcohol's probably considered in the diet.

378
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:22,950
Okay, but you said lack of physical activity, stress.

379
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:28,960
What could be another one? That it could be.

380
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:33,430
I don't know the specific data there, but. Yes. Yeah.

381
00:45:33,910 --> 00:45:37,270
Genetics, family history. That's a good one.

382
00:45:38,530 --> 00:45:41,709
But that's all. Is that a lifestyle risk factor?

383
00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:48,420
All your genetics? I mean, this one's kind of hard to separate.

384
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:55,659
Yes, obesity would be the third one. So it's a lack of exercise.

385
00:45:55,660 --> 00:46:02,709
Stress and obesity would be things outside of dated smoking that also increases the risk that are modifiable.

386
00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:10,540
So other than the family history component. OC seeing three.

387
00:46:16,030 --> 00:46:28,780
Yes. I'm going to attach that. Most of the Saudi team was it was close, but it was time to work.

388
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:38,380
Processed foods. Yes. The majority of sodium in the food supply comes from processed food.

389
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:48,550
Yeah. So what I'll say, and this is there are some interesting studies out of the U.K. where they.

390
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:58,300
Works with food manufacturers. It was a policy to gradually start decreasing the amount of sodium in processed foods.

391
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:10,420
And when they did that, the public did not notice, because if you decrease sodium slowly, you kind of your taste adjusts and you don't notice it.

392
00:47:10,450 --> 00:47:15,340
So they were able to reduce the amount of sodium and processed foods very gradually.

393
00:47:16,450 --> 00:47:25,930
Nobody really noticed it. And so that's a potential like population level intervention that would probably be difficult to pass somewhere like here.

394
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:28,840
But that's something that's been potentially effective,

395
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:34,870
is really doing it slowly so that the public doesn't really notice a change in taste or quality.

396
00:47:35,170 --> 00:47:39,430
But it definitely can lower the amount of sodium in processed and packaged foods

397
00:47:41,410 --> 00:47:48,730
and also people who go on a low sodium diet and follow it for quite some time,

398
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:52,760
they that are very sensitive to things that are salty.

399
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:57,730
So I know we won't have our in session, class session on heart failure,

400
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:02,260
but patients with heart failure often have to be on like a two gram sodium diet.

401
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:08,200
And after they're kind of comply with that for a while, a lot of patients will tell me,

402
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:12,370
like, I can't even eat a potato chip because it takes so overly salty.

403
00:48:12,370 --> 00:48:19,590
So your taste buds do adjust. So then things tend to taste really, really very salty.

404
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:24,180
So a gradual reduction is not really noticeable to the palate.

405
00:48:24,190 --> 00:48:30,460
So that's those are some public health measures that have been considered and successful in other countries.

406
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:44,290
Now he can't seem to see the lifestyle and two to.

407
00:48:46,700 --> 00:49:00,830
Initial pharmacotherapy is often chosen among the following four classes of medications seem to be what are.

408
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:10,350
Not so? No, not statins. Diuretics is one.

409
00:49:11,970 --> 00:49:18,750
What else might be used, ACE inhibitors and receptor blockers.

410
00:49:20,730 --> 00:49:25,300
Yes. So, yes, I mean, that was close.

411
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:31,590
We'll give that to team three. You guys do not need to know these medication classes,

412
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:39,330
but often people are going to be started on medication management if they are truly hypertensive.

413
00:49:39,690 --> 00:49:47,909
So that may involve diuretics, which we've talked a lot about, to help reduce the amount of fluid that's retained.

414
00:49:47,910 --> 00:49:55,200
So they'll and we know that there can be issues in terms of different vitamins and minerals that might be depleted.

415
00:49:55,500 --> 00:50:01,530
And there's calcium channel blockers, these angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, inhibitors,

416
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:08,850
the blockers you might also hear beta blockers really kind of the without going into too much detail,

417
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:13,560
these are more most involved with like vasodilation.

418
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:20,640
So helping the blood vessels to relax and not stay constricted and that will help lower blood pressure.

419
00:50:25,130 --> 00:50:39,440
All right. Let's go to team three. And a helpful counseling tip for patients trying to adhere to a two gram sodium

420
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:44,960
diet is to avoid foods containing more than this amount of sodium per serving.

421
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:48,529
You. This is like and I expect you guys know this,

422
00:50:48,530 --> 00:51:00,230
but often we will do this if we teach them reading label reading labels or label reading will say in order to stick to your two gram sodium diet,

423
00:51:00,890 --> 00:51:09,140
avoid foods that have more than this amount per serving of sodium was presented to us by.

424
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:17,320
I have to figure out what that is. So this is a certain MG amount.

425
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:22,120
What do you think would make sense here? Team three.

426
00:51:22,270 --> 00:51:38,160
Oh, and sorry. Can. I think I have a drink from 140, so I will take 140.

427
00:51:38,250 --> 00:51:45,690
That's what we used to recommend. So sit. They're looking at a food label and it's more than 140 milligrams of sodium.

428
00:51:45,690 --> 00:51:49,320
We'd say avoid that. We've kind of loosened. That's pretty strict.

429
00:51:49,350 --> 00:51:53,520
What else is too to. So I think that's reasonable.

430
00:51:53,580 --> 00:51:59,670
200. So if something has more than 200 milligrams per serving or we used to do 140,

431
00:52:01,110 --> 00:52:08,730
that would probably add up to then be more than two grams per day depending on how many foods.

432
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:13,740
So that could be a helpful tip there. Okay.

433
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:17,700
I'll give you guys both because those are reasonable. Okay.

434
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:25,920
Since that was acceptable time, one, you can go next, cool off and have a repeat of hey,

435
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:35,280
let's do it can be six for 100 is systolic blood pressure of less than 120.

436
00:52:36,140 --> 00:52:39,480
Yeah. I don't know.

437
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:45,240
Great. It's normal blood pressure.

438
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:50,000
So remember, both have to be below these markers.

439
00:52:50,010 --> 00:52:54,960
So 120 less than 120 and less than 80 is a normal blood pressure.

440
00:52:58,770 --> 00:53:04,220
Okay. Team three. Risk factors, physiology.

441
00:53:07,030 --> 00:53:12,580
High blood pressure puts added force on the walls of the arteries and can damage the endothelium.

442
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:19,780
Team one good. What is a rescue process?

443
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:22,830
Yes. Okay, so let's read this.

444
00:53:22,830 --> 00:53:31,500
High blood pressure puts added force on the walls of the arteries, can damage the endothelium, causing the arteries to become stiffer over time.

445
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:37,920
This damage makes the arteries more vulnerable to the narrowing and plaque buildup associated with this,

446
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:40,830
which is that atherosclerotic process that we talked about.

447
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:50,900
So that's how blood pressure or hypertension has become a risk factor for heart disease is the damage that it's causing to the vessels.

448
00:53:55,780 --> 00:54:01,990
Okay. Team one, let's do. And then she is asked for 100.

449
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:19,100
So data for specific recommendations is limited, is often encouraged that persons with hypertension et yes, potassium and yes I'll take it.

450
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:23,360
So potassium. Yes, but calcium and magnesium.

451
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:34,640
So. There's not like a lot of data to support an independent association with like increasing calcium improves blood pressure,

452
00:54:34,650 --> 00:54:37,440
increasing magnesium improves blood pressure.

453
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:45,210
But combined with that dietary pattern, these minerals do play a role potentially in blood pressure regulation.

454
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:52,049
In mouse models, there is more of a independent association there.

455
00:54:52,050 --> 00:54:58,020
So it can be very beneficial, but probably not just a lot.

456
00:54:58,110 --> 00:55:03,599
Like if you were just to increase your calcium and not do anything else, you're probably not going to see a big benefit.

457
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:08,860
It's kind of part of that entire dietary pattern. Okay.

458
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:15,530
I think we have this last one. Basal dilator, drug therapy.

459
00:55:15,530 --> 00:55:19,130
Does this to the diameter of ten to.

460
00:55:21,570 --> 00:55:24,209
Yes, it will increase the diameter of the blood vessel.

461
00:55:24,210 --> 00:55:30,930
So if it's dilating it, it's going to allow it to open up a little bit bigger, help the blood flow a little bit easier.

462
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:35,710
And I forgot to do that. The final jeopardy on here.

463
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:43,140
So sorry. I have that. Let me see if I have it written down.

464
00:55:51,090 --> 00:56:00,230
Okay. So look at your team scores. I'm going to write this the final Jeopardy out, and then you can make your wager.

465
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:05,069
So it is going to be the category is going to be an empty component.

466
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:08,400
So think empty. So give me just a minute.

467
00:56:10,670 --> 00:56:18,760
Yeah, let me see if I can find it.

468
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:24,780
We're out of time, so we have to write it down.

469
00:56:37,560 --> 00:57:27,630
And then, you know, this is one of the things that affects your job.

470
00:57:28,530 --> 00:57:36,550
Okay. Write down your wager somewhere so that you have it and you don't change it to anything.

471
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:06,580
Okay. Are you guys ready? Yes. Okay. You'll have, I think.

472
00:58:06,670 --> 00:58:10,370
What is it, a minute? Oh, I think it's a minute.

473
00:58:10,390 --> 00:58:14,620
One minute. It's about what it is.

474
00:58:15,730 --> 00:58:20,469
Yes. Okay.

475
00:58:20,470 --> 00:58:26,440
So you'll have to write down your answer because you can't say it and then it'll tell the other group.

476
00:58:26,830 --> 00:58:33,370
Okay, so we have one minute. Hold on. Let me just be very official.

477
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:50,950
Okay. Okay. This is the final of the dash diet plan includes whole grains, fish, poultry, and it is reduced in these particular foods.

478
00:58:50,950 --> 00:59:06,070
So name three foods that it specifically targets to reduce of.

479
00:59:25,730 --> 00:59:36,230
Yeah. Yeah, he's about 10 seconds.

480
00:59:38,250 --> 00:59:44,990
I think. Right. Okay.

481
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:50,060
Time's up. Did everybody write it down somewhere?

482
00:59:50,390 --> 00:59:56,420
Yeah. Okay. We'll start with t one.

483
00:59:57,570 --> 01:00:02,370
What is your answer? We said red meat, sweets and sugar sweetened beverages.

484
01:00:03,070 --> 01:00:06,390
K That is correct. And bet it all. You bet.

485
01:00:07,890 --> 01:00:12,870
You want me to want you to go.

486
01:00:14,610 --> 01:00:24,510
Okay. So you have 4400 great team to what was your answer for sweetened beverages, red beans and sweets.

487
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:29,280
Great. Also at all. You bet. Okay.

488
01:00:30,740 --> 01:00:33,780
Okay. I'll get these all tilted up in three.

489
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:40,380
You also had two beverages. Sir.

490
01:00:40,810 --> 01:00:45,610
Okay. So great job, you guys.

491
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:50,290
Team three was the winner with 6200.

492
01:00:50,950 --> 01:00:55,029
Team two had 5881 had 4400.

493
01:00:55,030 --> 01:00:59,680
But you all got the final Jeopardy, correct?

494
01:01:00,460 --> 01:01:04,570
Does anybody know we're done early because we have questions on hypertension.

495
01:01:05,890 --> 01:01:09,700
Make sure you know the dash diet, not just for this class.

496
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:16,870
Honestly, with nutrition counseling, we use the dash diet all the time for all types of things.

497
01:01:16,870 --> 01:01:24,460
Like if somebody comes to me and they say they want like a dietary pattern, just a healthy diet,

498
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:30,159
we would probably do something similar to the Dash diet like we use it in heart score are more stable.

499
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:32,860
Heart failure patients will implement a dash diet.

500
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:42,940
People that want like an anti-inflammatory diet will say the dash diet might work just because it is so high in fruits and vegetables.

501
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:52,450
The one thing it does emphasize is low fat dairy. You know, that may be that is whether or not that needs to change or can stay.

502
01:01:52,450 --> 01:01:57,759
It's probably because of the calcium and protein effect, but that is also a component of the dash diet.

503
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:01,600
So be comfortable with the components of the dash diet.

504
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:10,780
If you're doing the hypertension case study, make sure when you're doing the diet analysis of that patient's diet that you compare their

505
01:02:10,780 --> 01:02:16,450
intake of each component of the dash diet compared to what we would recommend them to get.

506
01:02:16,870 --> 01:02:23,110
Okay. So each component. Yes, for like really low sodium, I think it was like 1500.

507
01:02:23,650 --> 01:02:30,969
Do you find that like is that contain just like natural sodium foods or is it like some package, some added salt?

508
01:02:30,970 --> 01:02:39,970
Still, it's probably very minimal in packaged foods and also very little added sodium.

509
01:02:40,270 --> 01:02:45,070
So it would be nice to know what the average was like is naturally occurring.

510
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:53,020
It's probably just more the the amount that would be naturally in foods without added sodium and processing it out of sodium is cooking.

511
01:02:53,020 --> 01:03:00,730
It's pretty low. You guys, I would suggest track your intake just for a day and see where you're at with sodium.

512
01:03:01,300 --> 01:03:05,709
If you eat out, it's probably going to be pretty high and that's okay.

513
01:03:05,710 --> 01:03:15,250
Most people, an elevated amount of sodium is not a problem, but it's more of a high risk patients where it can be really helpful to cut back on that.

514
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:19,270
Okay. All right. So you guys are all done for today.

515
01:03:19,270 --> 01:03:19,390
I'll.
