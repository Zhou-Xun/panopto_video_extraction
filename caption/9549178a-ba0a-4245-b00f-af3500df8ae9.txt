1
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:07,950
I'm sorry. I was Fabbri.

2
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:13,440
Terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible.

3
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:25,770
Oh, it was a terrible. Someone said return after on Wednesday, myostatin midterm.

4
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:32,910
I made you write a paper. Although, like you've already.

5
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:36,840
You had already done most of the work for it.

6
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,590
Right? Like, hopefully it did not take you that long to do this part.

7
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:45,960
And maybe it did. I see some yeses and some, like, glares.

8
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:55,860
All right. Well, I'm sorry that Barbara was not really angry, but it was probably good to have the extra time to study for that.

9
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:59,120
Yeah. Ah, yes. Oh.

10
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:06,390
Oh, great. So let's just say you call it great.

11
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:12,750
You want to do this thing I didn't think about on this this week?

12
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:36,570
Yeah. Yeah. Then you come to a full circle and swoop in and you know, you know, that's my pay grade anyway.

13
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:48,049
Yeah. The apartment here doesn't make that kind of. But we have a it's not that the department chair doesn't have power.

14
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:52,520
Exactly. There is power and there's not power over that.

15
00:01:52,520 --> 00:02:01,849
Kind of like no power over the schedule or you know, even the school has no power over things like that.

16
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:12,230
Those are like central decisions. And schools and colleges are kind of expressly forbidden from changing any of that stuff.

17
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:22,010
So, you know, there is the dean did send out a message asking people on Election Day to consider doing,

18
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:32,360
I forgot the word asynchronous week kind of lessons or whatever, but we can't mandate that or fired or anything like that.

19
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:41,210
So that would have to be a university decision. Well, maybe you can rest this weekend.

20
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:45,770
It's going to be a beautiful weekend. Nice weather.

21
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:50,770
I heard a story this morning on the radio about something that's owned by MSU.

22
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:56,750
Did anybody hear this, like on the way? And it must you owns this, like really large property of this.

23
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:07,640
It's like gardens. And they just built a treetop suspension bridge that you can walk across, and it's like you're walking in the tops of the trees.

24
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:12,290
But I wasn't completely paying attention, so I didn't hear the name of it.

25
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:18,730
And now I have to figure out what the name of it is, because I'm kind of interested in doing that this weekend with all the colors and stuff.

26
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:20,030
I think it would be nice.

27
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:30,830
And I have vowed not to work this weekend because I have had I have three revise and resubmit on papers come in right before the semester started.

28
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,190
And so I have been working nonstop, getting those papers ready to go.

29
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:41,110
And I have not had like a relaxing weekend in months.

30
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:48,770
So join me in a relapse and maybe I will see you in the tree as if I can figure out where they are.

31
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,570
I mean, Lansing is only an hour and away. An hour away.

32
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:57,620
So I presume that this tree places within an hour.

33
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:01,580
I don't know for sure. All right.

34
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:09,270
Let's talk about family. Okay.

35
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:18,770
So up until this part of the semester, we've really been focused on thinking about social status variables.

36
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:25,850
So these are kind of individual characteristics that determine your position in the social hierarchy, right?

37
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:33,920
So we talked about socioeconomic status. We talked about race and ethnicity, sex and gender, sexual orientation and gender identity.

38
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:43,639
So those are kind of what we've done so far. So here's sort of like here in this model, individual characteristics, of course,

39
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:53,240
these individual characteristics only have meaning within a particular social system, but now we're going to start talking about social contexts.

40
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:59,240
So that's kind of like for us here in this part of the model.

41
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:07,730
So we're going to talk about family this week. Next week we're going to talk about school and work, the neighborhoods and then social networks.

42
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:18,920
We're never really going to explicitly talk about this part, although this is kind of part of all of the conversations that we've had,

43
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:24,530
especially how these themes relate to the individual characteristics in this model.

44
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:34,130
And then, you know, this is sort of like a social ecological framework.

45
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:41,470
One version of it. And so it's talking about these sort of multiple levels of influence on power and then showing that life.

46
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:58,610
So this is probably easier than some of the things that we've talked about before, but maybe not as easy as it seems at first.

47
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:06,020
But like, what is a family? You had to come up with a definition of this because you want to study it.

48
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:23,780
How would you define family? Yeah, for sure.

49
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:34,850
I would say I guess it was kind of like, hey, like I was like trying to play like, okay,

50
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:42,290
so there's like legal family relationships through marriage or, or birth or adoption.

51
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:05,440
However, it could also include an element of living together within a household.

52
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:10,780
So you guys have captured the Census Bureau definition very nicely.

53
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:16,390
So according to the U.S. Census Bureau, a family consists of two or more people,

54
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:22,840
one of whom they designate as in the household or that are related by birth, marriage or adoptions.

55
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:28,660
That's that legal piece, Sasha, that you were mentioning. And then, like Ali said, in the same housing unit.

56
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:46,340
So does that definition feel complete to you?

57
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:57,500
As a researcher. Or are there other family relationships that social epidemiologists might want to study?

58
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:09,300
Like what's missing from that definition? Patricia and the siblings.

59
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:11,889
Sibling relationships. Okay.

60
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:18,850
So sibling relationships, particularly adult sibling relationships, once you're like not in the household together anymore.

61
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:22,180
Now, I was going to say extended family like grandparents.

62
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:30,170
Yeah. So people who are family but they don't live in the same house like grandparents or things like that.

63
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,500
Yeah. Okay. So chosen family, can you say more about what you mean there?

64
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:39,280
So it might be cheaper for individuals.

65
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:46,160
And our research together or.

66
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:59,370
Yeah. So you could be in a very close family like relationship, but you wouldn't be sort of counted as family in this definition.

67
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:07,410
But if we're thinking about the whole bifurcation of family, that might be just as important for health as this more like legal form.

68
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:12,300
Arrangements. Anything else that's missing from your.

69
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:38,010
Yes. There. Oh, yeah.

70
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:44,450
So I don't know how they do that in the census because they do count people.

71
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,470
So I don't know how they. I heard of the.

72
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:54,440
Yeah, that's a good question. I don't know. But yeah.

73
00:09:54,440 --> 00:10:03,239
That definition. So. Cohabiting partners are not included in here.

74
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:10,440
So you're in a marriage wife, but you're not legally married, but you live in the same housing unit.

75
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,380
So you're not really you're not included. You're.

76
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:22,540
Adult children no longer live in the household, but you sort of include it in here in thinking about family.

77
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:37,010
So there's a number of kind of what we would think of as family relationships that aren't captured in this definition but may be important for help.

78
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:50,260
Okay. So we're going to talk about marriage and health, which is a.

79
00:10:54,030 --> 00:11:01,440
Not a huge area of work in social epidemiology, but a fairly large area in sociology.

80
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:10,170
And so let's think about reasons why marriage might affect health.

81
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:30,930
Okay. Yeah.

82
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:37,950
So marriage could benefit help by influencing behavior.

83
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:48,470
Partners can influence each other's behavior. And also, as you were mentioning, with social support with that, what you were saying that there's idea.

84
00:11:55,130 --> 00:12:02,360
Yeah. So you have this, like, increased communication because you're like, you know, sharing recipes with someone.

85
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:08,190
You. I'm sure you. Yeah.

86
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:23,870
Yeah. So like you're saying, not in all cases, but generally it's financially beneficial to have like two potential earners.

87
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:34,010
Well, first, enough franchises potentially in the United States health care system to facilitate access to health care and health insurance.

88
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:41,600
Yeah. So you can you can have health insurance through a partner and that can be health promoting sorta.

89
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:53,790
Like was like a possible that I could talk like really badly about like cutting off resources for you and like, maybe, like, anything for me.

90
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:59,040
Yeah, absolutely. So marital quality is really important.

91
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:05,189
And thinking about the relationship and a number of you brought that up in your comments like what about marital quality?

92
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:09,419
I put an article, a link to an article in the chat for you.

93
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:15,239
If you want to look at it, that's that's more focused on marital quality and how I think there's less research on that because

94
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:20,040
there's fewer surveys that ask questions about marital quality and more that ask about marital status.

95
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:25,650
Yeah, financial resources that come from marriage and then also like the unpaid household labor that comes from.

96
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:33,750
Yeah. Take your children around the house.

97
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:37,379
Yeah. So there's the like there's the financial benefits,

98
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:45,240
but also the like the kind of the benefits from having the unpaid labor to the marriage relationships.

99
00:13:45,600 --> 00:14:01,780
Yeah. So. Oh, Sarah, did you want to say something? Yeah, I think that's a really interesting point.

100
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:07,179
And so like marriage, I'm going to show you some data on that in just a minute.

101
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:11,799
But it's almost like, you know, I when we started the class,

102
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:16,360
I said we talked about social status already and now we're going to talk about social context.

103
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:26,679
But marriage and marital status is becoming kind of like an aspect of social status, like a social status marker, which historically it wasn't like,

104
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:33,470
I'll show you the kind of time trends or whatever and marriage, but that is there is kind of like a shutout night there.

105
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:36,640
There are dramatic shows happening in marriage problem. Yeah.

106
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,869
So the things that you guys brought up already would fit into this marital resource as models.

107
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:49,479
So the idea is that marriage brings sort of health promoting resources to people and

108
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:55,810
the sort of first being economic resources which we know are important for health.

109
00:14:56,770 --> 00:15:00,850
This tends to benefit women more than men. And why would that be the case?

110
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:07,940
Yeah. Patricia has been earning more than women. Yeah. Men earn more than women don't.

111
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:13,910
Is that what you were going to say? Yeah. Yeah. So, you know, gender discrimination and pay, basically.

112
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:17,330
So this on average is going to benefit women more than men.

113
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:26,390
Social support. So married people kind of have a built in source of emotional and instrumental social support.

114
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:32,060
You know, you have somebody who can drive you to the hospital if you're having a colonoscopy.

115
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:40,280
Right. Yeah. Somebody who's kind of there at the end of the day when you want to complain about what happened at work.

116
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:45,020
But of course, like Sasha said right off, this is not a healthy relationship.

117
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:53,210
Then of course, it's not going to provide social support. It's going to provide a lot of social conflict and could help farming.

118
00:15:54,980 --> 00:16:00,290
Do you think that this tends to benefit women or men more than heterosexual marriages?

119
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:06,900
No, I say that because I feel like men tend to get a lot of.

120
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:13,149
Women. Yeah.

121
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:23,080
This tends to benefit men more because women tend to have richer social networks socialized to pay attention to these kinds of things,

122
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:31,960
whereas men aren't. And then this is the other thing that I mentioned, which is social regulation.

123
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:39,160
So married people tend to regulate one another's health behaviors.

124
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:45,000
You're drinking too much or whatever. You know, think that kind of thing.

125
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:49,980
And who do you think that this would benefit more in heterosexual marriages?

126
00:16:55,420 --> 00:17:00,760
Men. Yeah. Their behavior tends to be less healthy than women.

127
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:07,930
And so there tends to be more regulation of men's health behavior in marriage than for women.

128
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:14,859
All right. But then there's another way of thinking about why marriage would affect health.

129
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:19,210
And that's sort of not about the resources, but it's a crisis model.

130
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:26,410
And it says that marriage doesn't really benefit health, but the strains of marital dissolution.

131
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:31,690
So like ending a marriage divorce separation. But that that damages health.

132
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:48,080
And so this is what's that the paper by weight and use that are used human weight.

133
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:58,700
That paper is really trying to tease this out by looking at those marital biographies and looking at the relationships over and with health over time,

134
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:04,220
even though it's like really complicated and confusing what they're trying to do,

135
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:11,719
but they're trying to get at this idea and then it's not really mentioned in the readings,

136
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:21,410
but you could consider as part of the crisis model that not getting married could be stressful when marriage is normative and expected.

137
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:25,070
Think we talked about this when we talked you talked about gender,

138
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:34,400
that there can be strong expectations and gendered expectations for marriage and that it can be a source of stress if you don't meet that expectation.

139
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:41,390
So I show your comment made me laugh about your parents who are like, you're 23 and you're not married.

140
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:46,550
What's wrong with you? And you want to say more about that.

141
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:57,710
Now, that's literally not my mom's first marriage or she's married to 18, so she's like, Yeah, yeah, I think you're all right.

142
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:02,330
Okay. Yeah. Oh, yeah.

143
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:07,280
My parents got married at 18 at 19, and then I got married when I was 21.

144
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:13,970
So I thought I was like, really grown up. Um, it was a week after I graduated from college.

145
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:22,640
I totally thought I was drunk. I don't. I don't know why, but I always was kind of like an old whatever age I was.

146
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:29,569
So I think it was fine and it seems to it worked out okay, but, you know, you never know.

147
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:34,040
But I think you're fine. Sasha. No pressure there.

148
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:37,100
You got money. All right.

149
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:47,810
So the evidence on marriage and how it's a very consistent finding that married people have better mental and physical health than the non married,

150
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:57,400
including co-founders. This may change over time.

151
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:10,469
For heterosexual couples, marriage does appear to be more protective for men for a lot of the reasons that we talked about earlier,

152
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:15,480
although there are some more recent studies that show that the benefits are similar for women and men.

153
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:21,389
So it kind of depends on the study. And I think this may change over time,

154
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:28,290
although I think COVID probably threw us back in terms of the extent to which

155
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:33,090
marriage was equally beneficial for women and men in heterosexual couples.

156
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:36,240
But we'll see what the future brings.

157
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:45,210
Those are the the question about this, though, and I think a number of you brought up comments about this, particularly related to policies.

158
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:55,260
I'm trying to remember who brought this up. Abbott mentioned that marriage is not naturally healthy.

159
00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:00,580
So what is what are social changes that can reduce the harms of divorce?

160
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:04,320
So thinking about that crisis kind of model.

161
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:13,020
And then Ali and Anna both talked about, could you intervene on divorce and is that what you want to do?

162
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:20,940
So it gets at this question of whether the relationship between marriage and health is due to selection or if it's causal.

163
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:31,820
So what might be an argument for marriage being the relationship between marriage and health being due to selection rather than causation?

164
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:55,170
It's not getting out, but. You are. They are?

165
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:04,840
Yeah, both men. There is like mental and physical health kinds of people who are healthier, mentally and physically are more likely to get married.

166
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:13,750
And so it could be that the difference the difference is that you see later on or even early on due to that selection into marriage.

167
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:22,149
Yeah. That the article about marriage control for a lot of factors that are like costly prior to the marriage and to health.

168
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:25,900
But it's worth mentioning that there are a lot of things like for example.

169
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:31,230
So I guess you have an education.

170
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:43,459
Yeah. Yeah. So not only are healthier people selected into marriage, but people with higher social status characteristics are selected into marriage.

171
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:46,790
And so it could be that like, you know,

172
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:52,639
people with with higher levels of education or higher levels of income or whatever are more likely to get married.

173
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:58,520
And so what you're really seeing is just these differences that preexisting before marriage.

174
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:11,690
But you know this I think the policy questions were really interesting because a lot of this research was used during specifically

175
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:20,090
during the George W Bush administration for policies to promote marriage among people who were receiving public assistance.

176
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:25,100
There were there was a lot of money put into programs to like to increase marriage,

177
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:34,310
because the idea was that this was sort of this was causally associated with health and other outcomes.

178
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:43,280
And so it is the case that this kind of research can be used or for that kind of intervention,

179
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:47,690
even though I think it was interesting that both of you were like, Yeah, I really think we should.

180
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:57,350
Do you want to say more about oh, no, no, go ahead. I wasn't concerned that people.

181
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:11,360
And who's there? So then how did.

182
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:16,370
How did this place. Trying to.

183
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:27,660
I think that some of those policies were more focused on people who were receiving TANF to various assistance to families.

184
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:31,560
That's who they were kind of targeting with those policies.

185
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:40,290
But it is true that there are certain benefits, like regular Social Security or Social Security that.

186
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:45,230
In fact, getting married and not changing your financial circumstances.

187
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:53,830
So my grandmother, who was widowed twice for me, like she just outlive all these.

188
00:24:54,500 --> 00:25:01,370
And then she had like a boyfriend when she was, you know, much older.

189
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:05,360
And he moved in with her after she had a stroke.

190
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:10,879
And if you knew her, you would understand why it is like so hard to believe that they did not get married,

191
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,900
but they didn't get married because of Social Security.

192
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:18,920
So her Social Security benefits would have dropped if she married him because he had earned less.

193
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:31,110
But you know her. And but she was this very, very conservative Southern Baptist woman from Alabama.

194
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:34,200
And we were all just like, you need me to live here.

195
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:42,120
But it was business like this financial. So, yes, the financial piece kind of comes out.

196
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:47,400
I was also talking to a friend of mine yesterday who is a single parent,

197
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:55,680
and she was talking about the sort of the tax implications of being single and how,

198
00:25:55,860 --> 00:26:00,510
you know, she misses out on these kind of tax benefits that married people have.

199
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:09,180
And so, yes, there are like financial implications of these things, too, that are related to government benefits and things.

200
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:26,600
Sure. You know. Something like that.

201
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:35,790
Yeah. Yeah. So depending on your circumstances, it might not be a financial benefit.

202
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:39,470
It might be a financial to you. Yeah.

203
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:46,790
Oh. I.

204
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:58,340
I don't know. I'm right. And I don't. I mean, I think marriage is.

205
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:12,090
And all the people were horrible and people really suffered.

206
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:22,820
So, yeah, I. Cohen.

207
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:31,270
You agree? Yes.

208
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:35,940
Oh, yeah. Patricia, go ahead. I'm just curious, like, why would the government why?

209
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:46,980
What was the government? Because they think that then they would rely less on government assistance because there would be

210
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:56,350
more sort of financial support under this kind of idea that this kind of man is breadwinners model.

211
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:09,010
But it sort of neglects an understanding of various forms of discrimination that result.

212
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:16,150
And that not being the case, people who are more likely to be on these benefits.

213
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:26,290
And so they were probably wrong, but that was their idea, was that if people get married, they'll rely less on the government for assistance.

214
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:45,440
Yeah. There. Well, yeah.

215
00:28:53,220 --> 00:29:00,480
No, but I know what you're saying. I mean, I think historically societies have had an interest in promoting marriage as a

216
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:08,300
form of social control and also as a way to manage property rights and things.

217
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:11,490
So that's that's kind of long standing.

218
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:21,330
I don't know. I don't know when it's sort of like entered into the tax code in specific ways or things like that.

219
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:27,600
But I mean, I think marriage has always been very much tied up like the state has always had a strong

220
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:34,320
interest in promoting marriage and controlling marriage and and that sort of thing.

221
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:47,090
Yeah. So sometimes we think about marriage as like, Oh, love, and there's much more kind of going on there.

222
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:55,960
I found out when we when we bought our first house in Michigan, which was in 2013.

223
00:29:55,970 --> 00:30:05,930
I think so. Not that long ago. Right. There was a law and I'm going to mess this up, but we can look it up later and see if it's right.

224
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:15,560
So for some reason, I wasn't going to be able to to go to the meeting where we signed something and the realtor said,

225
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:25,910
oh, you don't need to be there in Michigan. Like it's if it's a husband and wife, only the husband's like participates in this part or something.

226
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:31,910
So basically there's like still these laws, like weird laws on the books, but.

227
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:39,090
Have these, like your gender things related to marriage.

228
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:44,850
You know, it used to be like in the seventies, a married woman couldn't get a credit card without her husband.

229
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:51,850
Giving her permission for it. So there's a lot of stuff like that.

230
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:58,200
Yeah. Yeah. All right.

231
00:30:58,530 --> 00:31:04,710
So if we kind of if we buy the argument, well, maybe we don't maybe you should talk about that.

232
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:11,670
So if you're you're thinking on on for the balance, the selection or causation,

233
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:24,150
do you think that it's reasonable that there's some potential, that there is a causal relationship here, that marriage promotes health?

234
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:31,290
I see some nods. I think probably some.

235
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:35,820
Maybe not as much as like maybe not. The entire thing is causation.

236
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:43,739
There is definitely some selection, but I think that's reasonable to think that there are some ways in which being

237
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:47,310
married really does promote health for the reasons that we've talked about,

238
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:53,880
like particularly with the financial benefits that you do still get for marriage in most cases, not all.

239
00:31:55,350 --> 00:32:00,240
But if we kind of accept this idea that there is a causal relationship here,

240
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:10,050
then I want us to keep that in mind as we start looking at these next slides which are showing kind of patterns and trends over time in marriage.

241
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:21,040
Okay. So I'll read this to you. So this is data from 2014.

242
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:27,630
So it says one in four of today's young adults may never marry.

243
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:34,240
So what they're showing is the person over here never married by different birth cohorts.

244
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,330
So each line is a different ten year birth cohort.

245
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:46,920
And the first data point they're showing you is when people in that cohort were age 25 to 34 and then ten years later when they're 45 to 54,

246
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:51,790
I'm sorry. And then all the way down here five years later and then ten years later, when they're 45.

247
00:32:52,670 --> 00:33:02,110
Now, 20 years later, ten, 20, 45 -25 is 24, 20 every year when they're 45 to 54.

248
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:09,700
Okay. So you can see that for every cohort as they age, a smaller percentage is never married.

249
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:16,480
Right. But you can also see these sort of huge differences across birth cohorts.

250
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:21,340
So this first one is people who are 25 to 34 in 1960.

251
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:26,710
And then this last one is people who are 25 to 34 in 2010.

252
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:31,360
And so you can see that for the 1960 birth cohort,

253
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:40,810
those people who were only 12% of people who were 25 to 34 in 1960 had never been married through like almost everybody.

254
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:50,770
Right. And then by the time they are 55, 40 to 54, that's probably about 5% of them had been married.

255
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:55,680
So like virtually everyone got married then.

256
00:33:55,900 --> 00:34:01,870
If we skip ahead to this cohort, I think that might be more.

257
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:10,650
2209 20. I don't know, but I think I'm in this one maybe at the very top.

258
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:22,350
So when this cohort was aged 25 to 34 in 2010, 47 of 47% of them had not been married.

259
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:25,560
So basically like half had never been married.

260
00:34:25,890 --> 00:34:32,940
And it's expected that by the time they're 45 to 54 in 2030, oh, yeah.

261
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:44,370
25% will have never married. And I imagine if we had your cohort, it wouldn't be even up here.

262
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:56,760
Probably, right. You guys are all like married, just stupid. But I just want to point out that my cohort started that we thought marriage.

263
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:03,630
Yeah. What's that? You know, probably.

264
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:12,250
What's. Yeah.

265
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:18,839
Like millennials get a bad rap. I'm technically Gen X, I'm just, I'm like just on that side of yeah.

266
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:27,960
So I think that actually there may be some millennials on here, but it's like my sister who's four years younger than the millennial.

267
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:33,750
Yeah. We just. We straddled the generations.

268
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,450
Although I will say that like she is actually quite different.

269
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:46,809
I think the deciding thing is that like we didn't have cell phones in college and she did.

270
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:59,020
And I think that's like just like a dividing line and just like the Internet, the we had email, but it was like not really a thing.

271
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:06,070
So and that's on the side anyway. So you can see this is really changing now.

272
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:12,700
Marriage is good for health. Where are the implications of this for population health?

273
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:27,450
Yeah. Colin. Um, but you know how it started with the life expectancy about how people.

274
00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:37,719
Yeah. I mean, if it really is good for health and fewer people all have those health benefit or health access to health promoting thing.

275
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:42,430
Right. It could lead to a declining population. We'll see. You know, I don't know.

276
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:47,410
Yeah, it's really interesting, my comment that marriage is not actually a good thing biologically.

277
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:53,890
Yeah. If people are adopting different strategies to how to compensate or to if societies change.

278
00:36:54,130 --> 00:37:00,190
Yeah. And rewarding marriage less because it's less normative then it's kind of like said yeah,

279
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:05,050
if marriage loses its benefits right, then it wouldn't matter.

280
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:14,610
Or if whatever those benefits were that accrue to you due to marriage, if you can get them from another source now, then we also wouldn't see it.

281
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:15,890
So that's a great point.

282
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:25,959
It's like, you know, marriage, maybe health, promoting in a particular context or a particular time and then not be later or somewhere else.

283
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:32,000
And so that will have implications. Okay.

284
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:38,720
So then let's look at this in the context of education.

285
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:46,500
And so this is showing education and marriage, and it's showing different patterns for women and men.

286
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:51,350
So this is the percent of men and women age 25 and older who've never been married.

287
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:55,490
Just like what we saw before by education.

288
00:37:55,880 --> 00:38:00,520
And it's showing you from 1960 to 2012. And so men are on the left.

289
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:03,889
Women are on the right without even looking at these numbers.

290
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:06,660
These are the different colors and the different level of education.

291
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:14,960
So high school or less to your degree, some college, bachelor's and postgraduate degree, what do you immediately notice about well, that doesn't work.

292
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:20,630
How do you what do you notice about men in 1960?

293
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:28,340
Here, just look at this. You don't have to be able to read the numbers, but I'll read on to you.

294
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:35,380
13, 11, ten, nine. Yeah.

295
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:39,820
Pretty similar regardless. Yeah, they're basically the same.

296
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:48,120
Like men's education level is clearly not a strong predictor of whether they were married or not in 1960.

297
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:52,270
And then what do you notice by the time we get to 2012?

298
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:04,750
Yeah, it's it's it's widening. There's this widening gap.

299
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:14,980
So the. So 25% of men with the lowest level of education have never been married.

300
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:23,049
Versus it looks like 23% for bachelor's degree and some college.

301
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:29,230
So it looks like it's kind of the same for that. And then postgraduate degree, 14%.

302
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:36,580
So. So by 2012, the men who were most likely to marry were those with the highest levels of education.

303
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:42,820
And why do you think that might be? Yeah, I'm thinking, um.

304
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:53,830
I don't know. The economy's doing so well. And I think in the when you think of, for example, I think some women excuse.

305
00:39:57,270 --> 00:40:09,610
Didn't have anything. And then right now, things are shifting towards something else.

306
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:13,170
You don't have to be greedy. So it makes sense that people.

307
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:19,570
We have no to grieve.

308
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:30,990
Yeah, they have lower earning potential now and it's like dramatically different in some ways than it was in the

309
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:38,610
1960s when we had more manufacturing jobs that pay high wages to people with lower levels of education.

310
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:50,849
So this is kind of the result of changes related to globalization and deindustrialization that are kind of shifting us,

311
00:40:50,850 --> 00:41:02,790
because if marriage isn't offering economic benefits to you, you may not be quite as as interested in it, right?

312
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:09,060
Like or it may make less sense if there's not a financial benefit to this.

313
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:15,509
Okay. So now let's look at what happened for women. Okay.

314
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:25,350
So if we look at 1960, what do you notice about the differences in 1960 for women and how those compared to men?

315
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:33,090
I'll just tell you. This is 30.

316
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:39,740
In 1916, 31% of women with a postgraduate degree, 25 and older had never been married.

317
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:44,640
Then bachelors degree, then two year degree, then high school degree.

318
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:48,920
So 7% of women with a high school diploma were we're not married.

319
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:52,910
In 1964, 31% with a postgraduate degree.

320
00:41:57,860 --> 00:42:02,390
Yeah. You have to.

321
00:42:06,010 --> 00:42:18,549
Gender equality so that women, when these men are now men are 52 was okay with 17.

322
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:22,010
And I feel that women and some want.

323
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:27,360
So I think that's that's that's what I'm thinking.

324
00:42:27,610 --> 00:42:34,570
Yeah. This sort of went against being highly educated, sort of went against gender norms for women in the 1960s.

325
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:42,340
And so you see this really big difference, whereas for men in the 1960s, education kind of made no difference in whether they got married.

326
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:46,290
But it was really important for women in 1960.

327
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:49,570
But then what do you notice in 2012 for women?

328
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:58,310
It's like it's completely converted straight.

329
00:42:58,630 --> 00:43:07,570
So for women in 2012, like your educational attainment is not a good predictor of whether you're married.

330
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:11,050
So it flips for women and men over time.

331
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:22,410
And again, this is going to be related to these larger like macro economic circumstances out.

332
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:37,270
Wonder. Yeah.

333
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:42,379
This would have been rare to have a woman to have a postgraduate degree in 1960.

334
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:46,410
This would have been a small, very select. Yeah.

335
00:43:54,260 --> 00:44:04,110
But this kind of brings us back a little bit, I think, to this idea of selection of sex and who's getting married and how that impacts.

336
00:44:04,130 --> 00:44:15,210
All right. Particularly for men. So there's education differences in marriage.

337
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:23,890
There's also race differences in marriage. So this is the percent of adults age 25 and older who have never been married.

338
00:44:23,890 --> 00:44:27,850
So for 1960, they only have data on the black and white population.

339
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:32,980
And then in 1980, we start to get data on Asian and Hispanic populations.

340
00:44:33,430 --> 00:44:40,750
But in 1960, what do you notice about black white differences and the percent of adults who've never been married?

341
00:44:48,810 --> 00:44:53,140
There's no difference, right? I'm sorry, Patricia. Yeah, there's basically no difference.

342
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:56,350
So for the black population, it was 9% had never been married.

343
00:44:56,350 --> 00:45:02,220
And for the white population, 8%. It's like almost everybody got married and didn't really matter by race.

344
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:12,090
And then what do you see happen over time? Yeah, this gap like is growing wider and wider over time.

345
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:17,400
And there's really quite large differences here by the time you get to 2012.

346
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:26,070
Well, a lot of this is probably related to the same things that you were talking about before with economic opportunities.

347
00:45:39,950 --> 00:45:49,120
So then I guess if we're going back to that question of how might this influence population health if marriage is causally related to health, right,

348
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:54,620
then the implications of this and the educational disparities for men could mean that

349
00:45:54,620 --> 00:46:00,080
you can see widening inequality is by educational attainment for men and by race.

350
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:05,849
If this is truly like a causal relationship. All right.

351
00:46:05,850 --> 00:46:09,299
So I want to give you some data on marriage and divorce rates.

352
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:17,960
So overall, there's been a decline in both marriage and divorce rates over time, and these are showing you brood rates.

353
00:46:17,970 --> 00:46:25,530
So this is per 1000 adult population, both her divorce and for marriage.

354
00:46:26,010 --> 00:46:31,680
And so as of 2016, both marriage rates and divorce rates are decreasing.

355
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:39,540
Sarah Getting back to the Millennials. Recent studies have shown that millennials are choosing to wait longer to get married,

356
00:46:39,870 --> 00:46:45,990
but they're also staying married longer and are the main driver in the decline of both marriage and divorce rates.

357
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:52,710
Marriage rate in the United States is currently 6.8 per 1000 total population.

358
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:57,000
The divorce rate is 3.2 per 1000 population.

359
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:00,960
And this is, you know, sort of the crude divorce rate.

360
00:47:01,290 --> 00:47:10,140
If you look at the rate among people who are married, if that's your denominator, then the divorce rate per 1000 married women is 16.9.

361
00:47:10,710 --> 00:47:17,970
Um, interestingly, the divorce rate per 1000 married women is nearly double that of 1960.

362
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:24,570
You know, the laws and norms around divorce have changed a lot since the 1960s.

363
00:47:24,990 --> 00:47:32,700
Um, but it's down from the all time high of 22.6 per 1000 married women in the 1980s.

364
00:47:32,710 --> 00:47:37,860
So divorce was really high in the 1980s. It's come down over time.

365
00:47:40,050 --> 00:47:44,460
Almost 50% of marriages in the U.S. will end in divorce or separation.

366
00:47:45,090 --> 00:47:56,489
Um, the estimate is that 41% of all first marriages end in divorce, 60% of second marriages, and 73% of third marriages end in divorce.

367
00:47:56,490 --> 00:48:07,319
So people don't really get better at it over time. Um, what it looks like from the data, um, that's so that's the numbers on divorce.

368
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:12,780
I'll show you a little more about that. So this is the divorce rate for adults age 50 and older.

369
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:18,839
Ah, sorry. This one's 50 and older. This one's 42, 49.

370
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:22,860
This is 25 to 39 from 1990 to 2015.

371
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:27,870
So these are again different like first cohorts in the same amount of time.

372
00:48:28,410 --> 00:48:42,210
So for people 25 to 39 from 1990 to 2015, there's been a 21% increase in divorce for people 40 to 49, a 40% increase in terms of the 100% increase.

373
00:48:42,870 --> 00:48:47,820
So these are like, we know, baby boomers and older.

374
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:56,190
Um, so for younger people, the divorce rates are declining, but for older people, earlier of birth cohorts, they're increasing.

375
00:48:56,200 --> 00:49:06,220
So remember, though, these were people who got married at a time where everyone got married and so that could be contributing a little bit.

376
00:49:06,230 --> 00:49:14,520
So, um, whereas here marriage rates are much lower and so we're seeing a lower divorce rate.

377
00:49:17,210 --> 00:49:20,420
So these trends, you know,

378
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:30,229
if we're looking at sort of the crisis model of marriage and how these trends might suggest that there would be an improvement in population health.

379
00:49:30,230 --> 00:49:37,280
Right. Because if it's divorce, the negative for health rather than marriage being positive for health, then this would be good for population health.

380
00:49:41,310 --> 00:49:50,790
All right. So let's talk about parents now and why being a parent might affect health.

381
00:49:57,780 --> 00:50:01,990
I know what I gather. Mm.

382
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:07,080
Yeah. Yeah. Children can be challenging.

383
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:11,490
That's true. So you can have stress. Yeah.

384
00:50:14,350 --> 00:50:19,740
Like the process of being OC distributed.

385
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:30,059
Yeah. So there could be health effects, just like gestation of pregnancy and childbirth and those kind of like breastfeeding, whatever.

386
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:37,020
Like all of these things could have implications for health. It could affect mental health positively.

387
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:41,010
Okay. Yeah. We have an optimum in the back here.

388
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:44,760
It could be good for you, right? What's that?

389
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:52,709
I is that. I know my friends like it because not all children are stressful.

390
00:50:52,710 --> 00:51:00,470
They can bring joy to their parents. You know, Caitlin, creating a child seems very expensive.

391
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:05,190
So, like, financially. Yeah, they're very expensive.

392
00:51:05,190 --> 00:51:08,780
Jackie They keep adding other stuff. Yeah, yeah.

393
00:51:08,830 --> 00:51:12,300
Social support and, like, take care of you unless you're older. Yeah.

394
00:51:12,390 --> 00:51:16,080
So they can be a source of support, particularly once you're older.

395
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:19,500
Yeah, sure. Yeah. Uh huh.

396
00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:27,719
Um, especially like your baby.

397
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:32,880
And then, like. And then also.

398
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:43,260
Um. Then. Kids go to school for.

399
00:51:47,230 --> 00:51:50,770
Important to certain things that may not be that.

400
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:58,870
Yeah. So you're as a parent, you're exposed to judgment from other parents, which can be a source of stress.

401
00:51:59,170 --> 00:52:07,100
There's also just like you're saying that the time demands in addition to the financial demands, I think that that can be stressful.

402
00:52:08,230 --> 00:52:11,290
Yeah. Anything else? Yeah. Olivia.

403
00:52:11,740 --> 00:52:16,540
I think for older children, there could be two out of the stressors.

404
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:23,800
One, if there are not aligned expectations for how you as a child are living your life and how your parents want you to do that.

405
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:30,810
I'm speaking from experience, but I've heard that that it can happen to people that can be really stressful for both.

406
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:36,910
Yeah. Love a parent. Like putting their happiness in the expectations of how another person behaves, which is kind of bananas.

407
00:52:36,910 --> 00:52:45,340
But like that can be really hard for both people. I don't know who said of older children can take care of their parents if that's the expectation,

408
00:52:45,340 --> 00:52:50,140
but if both people that could leave it quite like a lot of conflict that can happen around that.

409
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:50,469
Yeah.

410
00:52:50,470 --> 00:52:58,120
So there could be different expectations that parents and adult children have with one another that could lead to conflict that can be hard on them.

411
00:53:14,030 --> 00:53:22,879
Absolutely. There could be conflicts between the parenting role and the role of worker or spouse or other roles that we all share.

412
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:28,520
And I've another optimistic one, but I guess this one also depends on my I guess the category.

413
00:53:29,070 --> 00:53:34,420
Right. Like, once you have kids, it's kind of like you're like, ah, I see.

414
00:53:34,430 --> 00:53:37,190
This is what it's like. But it's like you're like, this is just like your own.

415
00:53:37,190 --> 00:53:40,850
And you also have, like, these, like, tiny people that you're, like, responsible for.

416
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:47,230
Yeah. That maybe we make healthier choices. Like, we're like, I want to see them, like, grow up and, um.

417
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:50,450
Yeah, maybe I'll start, like, smoking. Yeah.

418
00:53:50,450 --> 00:53:56,299
And children tell you things like that. Like I used to tell my grandmother, Granny, put your seatbelt on.

419
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:58,430
And my mom thinks this is hilarious, you know?

420
00:53:58,850 --> 00:54:04,309
And then like when my son was, you know, they teach the kids like that smoking is like the worst thing in the world.

421
00:54:04,310 --> 00:54:08,380
And so they will tell you. So there is definitely children will regulate your behavior.

422
00:54:08,390 --> 00:54:14,090
Yeah. Yeah. So, like, I'm taking care of like.

423
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:20,929
Yeah, I also have. Yeah.

424
00:54:20,930 --> 00:54:26,690
So that's an issue with like the trend in delayed childbearing is that oftentimes

425
00:54:26,690 --> 00:54:31,670
people when they have children later than than like they do in the past,

426
00:54:31,970 --> 00:54:38,959
it means that you've still got small children when you have aging parents that might also need to be taken care of, too.

427
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:42,230
And so that can create a lot of extra demands and conflict.

428
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:47,930
Yeah, I was just going to add the study that says that shows the best time to.

429
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:52,580
To get someone to stop smoking, right? Yeah.

430
00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:58,890
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. Yeah. These are all I think you might have gotten.

431
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:03,270
Well, I think there's one thing on my list you doesn't get. All right, so economic hardship.

432
00:55:03,810 --> 00:55:07,500
Right. Children are very expensive to raise in the United States.

433
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:17,729
There are not a lot of supports for families in terms of subsidized child care or paid leave, parental leave or things like that.

434
00:55:17,730 --> 00:55:33,360
So there is economic hardship involved. So this can also perhaps positively and negatively affect emotional support for spouses or partners.

435
00:55:34,290 --> 00:55:39,599
So it could be that that kind of goes down because now you're you're spending most of your energy,

436
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:42,870
like with your kid or kids rather than your partner.

437
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:51,450
But it could also be something that kind of increases emotional support that partners have with one another because they have this shared thing.

438
00:55:51,450 --> 00:55:55,050
So that probably depends a lot on the people involved in the relationship.

439
00:55:55,380 --> 00:56:00,150
Like you said, the roles, strain and role conflicts.

440
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:09,270
So this can be particularly the case for working mothers because of these sort of gendered expectations about caregiving.

441
00:56:10,170 --> 00:56:15,240
Um, we didn't talk about this one, but exposure to infectious agents.

442
00:56:16,290 --> 00:56:23,639
Every friend I have right now who has a child in daycare is just like losing it because these, like,

443
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:29,010
a lot of them have kids who never got to go to daycare until they were older because of COVID.

444
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:37,799
And so their immune systems are not not as strong as they would have been had they started daycare when they were babies.

445
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:44,540
And so they're sick all the time, like just constantly sick and not even with COVID.

446
00:56:44,550 --> 00:56:53,340
Like, there's my my friend of mine said last week there was in her son's toddler room, there was one COVID case and three RSV cases.

447
00:56:54,570 --> 00:56:58,730
And so it's it's it's exposing to germs.

448
00:57:00,390 --> 00:57:04,890
Nobody mentioned sleep disruption. So that can be or maybe alone.

449
00:57:04,890 --> 00:57:12,350
I mean you did mention that sleep disrupts. So, um, especially with very small children, but even sometimes older children, um,

450
00:57:12,510 --> 00:57:19,560
they disrupt your sleep, which can have implications for your health and sense of meaning.

451
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:24,120
So I think maybe this is one of the things you were getting at soccer that children

452
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:29,670
can provide a sense of meaning for people in life and that can be promoting.

453
00:57:30,450 --> 00:57:33,419
And then also this one that we mentioned, social regulation.

454
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:44,399
So children can sort of directly influence their parents health behaviors or or kind of this more indirect way where there's this sense of,

455
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:47,730
I need to take care of myself because I now have to take care of this other person.

456
00:57:48,270 --> 00:57:56,400
So there's kind of ways in which being a parent could be health promoting and sort of health damaging.

457
00:57:56,700 --> 00:58:01,319
And then it also probably depends a lot on the like the age of the kid,

458
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:05,370
whether we're talking about adult children or whether we're talking about a newborn.

459
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:15,690
Right. And then it's also going to depend a lot on your social and economic circumstances, whether this is something that's promoted or not.

460
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:23,280
So in terms of the evidence on parenthood and how they're really this is not like a big area of research.

461
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:28,080
There's few studies, kind of mixed results, probably for the reasons we just talked about.

462
00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:33,870
Children appear to be most detrimental to the health and well-being of single and divorced mothers.

463
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:41,130
Children may improve well-being under certain conditions.

464
00:58:41,580 --> 00:58:46,680
So when there's no economic hardship, when the mother is employed,

465
00:58:47,490 --> 00:58:53,400
when child care is available and affordable, and when partners share childcare responsibilities.

466
00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:06,890
So now let's look at how much these things are true.

467
00:59:09,290 --> 00:59:13,520
What do you think I'm going to show you? If you had to guess.

468
00:59:16,830 --> 00:59:22,440
Am I going to show you that childcare is available and affordable? Yeah. Yeah.

469
00:59:32,230 --> 00:59:36,700
The. Yeah. Yeah.

470
00:59:36,820 --> 00:59:46,150
He doesn't do much of that as much. As much as you like my business and especially like.

471
00:59:48,310 --> 00:59:51,430
Yeah, just raise the kids to 13.

472
00:59:54,390 --> 01:00:00,690
Sure. I just. Well, money?

473
01:00:01,650 --> 01:00:05,370
I guess so. I guess my perception of you might have been.

474
01:00:05,370 --> 01:00:16,050
But it's not just the environment. But also sometimes if I was sitting watching this and I remember, yeah, I think this is kind of on average,

475
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:24,150
this is associated with better outcomes, probably because this contributes because it's important for finances probably.

476
01:00:24,150 --> 01:00:34,620
And that that is like a bigger factor. But I would imagine that this depends a lot on what the woman's preferences are for paid work versus.

477
01:00:35,870 --> 01:00:37,459
Staying home with their kids. Right.

478
01:00:37,460 --> 01:00:51,980
So if you remember in one of the articles, I think it was the numbers, that article that the effects of having a partner helping with child care,

479
01:00:52,250 --> 01:00:58,730
like the effect of that depended on their beliefs about who should provide care.

480
01:00:59,090 --> 01:01:06,799
So for women who felt like it was the mother's responsibility to take care of their kids if their partner was helping them more,

481
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:13,910
it was bad for their mental health because they weren't fulfilling their own expectations

482
01:01:13,910 --> 01:01:17,900
about what they should be as a parent or how they should behave as a parent.

483
01:01:18,170 --> 01:01:25,129
So I would think that this was like pretty this is probably related overall to reducing financial hardship.

484
01:01:25,130 --> 01:01:29,540
But you can imagine that there could be people for whom this would be really damaging

485
01:01:29,930 --> 01:01:36,350
to health if it if it conflicted with their expectations or desires around parenthood.

486
01:01:39,650 --> 01:01:43,430
Okay. All right.

487
01:01:43,430 --> 01:01:51,980
So let's look at sort of parenthood and think about these changes, these trends in parenthood and how they might relate to population health.

488
01:01:52,310 --> 01:01:58,170
So this is showing you living arrangements of children under 18 from 1970 to 2013.

489
01:01:58,490 --> 01:02:02,750
And that top line, the purple line, is living with two married parents.

490
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:08,890
And so you can see that that the percent of children living with two married parents have declined a lot over this period.

491
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:14,120
So in 1958, almost 90% of kids lived with two parents.

492
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:17,870
And by 2014, that was 64.4%.

493
01:02:18,170 --> 01:02:21,229
So if we think back to that last slide,

494
01:02:21,230 --> 01:02:28,160
right where children seem to be the most detrimental to the health and well-being of single and divorced mothers,

495
01:02:29,330 --> 01:02:38,809
then you could imagine that this might have negative implications for population health as we have more single mother families.

496
01:02:38,810 --> 01:02:41,240
Right? So this mother only family is in blue.

497
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:51,110
So that went from 8% in 1958 to almost 24% of families and her kids living in mother only families in 2014.

498
01:02:51,410 --> 01:02:58,280
And then you can see down here along the bottom farther only families, you know, have increased, but it's still fairly rare.

499
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:04,460
And living with no parent is pretty low. Hasn't changed that much over time.

500
01:03:09,060 --> 01:03:18,210
Then we've got labor force participation. So that second point that you were raising about about working in that, beneficial or not?

501
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:26,490
So here you can see and this is actually this is only through 2018 and it shows 2020, but they have released the data for 2020.

502
01:03:26,610 --> 01:03:32,880
So I think that this is going to be like it's going to look pretty different once we have the pandemic hearing the data.

503
01:03:34,170 --> 01:03:40,260
But this is showing you the labor force participation rate of mothers by the age of their youngest child.

504
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:52,950
So 62% of mothers with a child under 30 are in the labor force versus 64.7% of those whose youngest child is under six.

505
01:03:53,340 --> 01:03:56,610
71.4% of those, I don't know.

506
01:03:56,610 --> 01:04:00,680
That's the total. I got the numbers wrong.

507
01:04:00,830 --> 01:04:04,220
This is under three. This is under six.

508
01:04:04,670 --> 01:04:09,470
This is combined under 18. And this is 6 to 17.

509
01:04:10,130 --> 01:04:17,450
So the older your youngest child is, the more likely a mother is to be in the labor force.

510
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:26,719
Which kind of makes sense because you don't have like kids are in school until they're like five or six years old.

511
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:30,730
And so they would have to be in childcare in the future.

512
01:04:33,290 --> 01:04:39,220
But you can see that this has like this has changed a lot since 1975.

513
01:04:39,260 --> 01:04:42,020
Women's labor force participation rates have increased a lot.

514
01:04:42,380 --> 01:04:51,740
Some of this, again, has to do with those macro economic changes where men's kind of opportunities,

515
01:04:51,740 --> 01:04:56,480
particularly men with low education, their economic opportunities have really declined.

516
01:04:56,780 --> 01:05:02,200
And so in order to maintain income, white women really need to enter the workforce.

517
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:12,319
So that's part of what has happened here. But from this perspective, if if the data is correct, that being employed improves mother's health.

518
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:18,440
And I think this suggests that this could be good in terms of population health because more mothers are employed.

519
01:05:21,820 --> 01:05:27,670
So here's the information about child care.

520
01:05:29,290 --> 01:05:36,610
So the title of this figure is For most families, the cost of licensed child care is out of reach.

521
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:42,670
So this is the US average monthly cost of licensed child care by different categories.

522
01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:48,640
So the first one is center based infant care. So this would be like a regular like daycare center.

523
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:58,360
And so the average cost and this was, I think 2018 data from 2018 was $1,230 per month.

524
01:06:00,190 --> 01:06:04,420
How would you like to spend an extra 1230 dollars per month?

525
01:06:05,860 --> 01:06:09,190
You probably wouldn't, right? And that's just for one.

526
01:06:09,550 --> 01:06:13,870
So if you got to double it, they don't really give you like a discount.

527
01:06:16,060 --> 01:06:27,600
So that's for center based infant care, center based toddler care, $910 a month, center based preschool or child care, 760.

528
01:06:27,610 --> 01:06:31,990
So, of course, as they get older, it gets a little less expensive, but you should have more of an average together.

529
01:06:32,410 --> 01:06:39,130
And then for family, child care, which is this is sort of like like home based daycare.

530
01:06:39,140 --> 01:06:44,550
So not a center. $800 a month, but is cheaper.

531
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:47,950
These are usually like mixed age groups,

532
01:06:48,670 --> 01:06:56,260
but it's still your cheapest option because $800 a month on average in the U.S. and depending on where you live,

533
01:06:56,260 --> 01:06:58,510
it can be much, much higher than that.

534
01:07:00,010 --> 01:07:10,060
So in terms of thinking about, you know, population, how is does this seem to be like a good thing or a bad thing?

535
01:07:14,050 --> 01:07:18,550
It's bad. Yeah, it's bad because this is extremely expensive.

536
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:26,910
Okay. You probably can't see that. But I'm going to you you're going to read you the numbers.

537
01:07:27,930 --> 01:07:37,980
So this is looking at trends in average weekly housework, hours by gender for people aged 25 to 64.

538
01:07:38,670 --> 01:07:46,410
And the data here comes from the USA Time Diary sample and the American Time Use Survey.

539
01:07:46,620 --> 01:07:53,250
Voice heard yesterday they released some new data from the American Time new survey showing what people did

540
01:07:53,610 --> 01:08:01,600
during the pandemic in terms of like commute time and how much that decreased and what they were doing instead.

541
01:08:01,620 --> 01:08:06,510
And it turns out people were sleeping more, which is probably good for health.

542
01:08:06,810 --> 01:08:12,210
And I think there was more exercise happening.

543
01:08:12,450 --> 01:08:17,580
So those are interesting. But that's that's what this data source is.

544
01:08:18,180 --> 01:08:24,560
And this is this is data for married mothers and married fathers.

545
01:08:24,570 --> 01:08:30,630
So there's no data in the study for single parents. But I'll I'll show you some some of that data in just a second.

546
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:45,350
And so they're looking at over time, from 1965 to 2010, reports of total housework, hours per week or housework, other housework and child care.

547
01:08:45,350 --> 01:08:54,929
And I'll tell you what, poor housework so poor housework is cooking meals, meal cleanup, house cleaning, laundry and ironing appliance.

548
01:08:54,930 --> 01:09:03,240
But I guess people do other housework as outdoor chores, repairs, garden and animal care bills and other financial.

549
01:09:04,170 --> 01:09:12,030
Okay. And then so this is showing the number of hours for married mothers, for married fathers, and then the ratio of mothers time to father's time.

550
01:09:12,330 --> 01:09:21,420
So if we look at total housework, in 1965, married mothers reported 35.7 hours per week of total housework,

551
01:09:22,350 --> 01:09:26,520
and then that declined to 18.3 hours by 2010.

552
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:30,719
And then if you look at married fathers, it's sort of the opposite pattern.

553
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:35,950
So they spent 4.7 hours in 1965 on total housework.

554
01:09:36,270 --> 01:09:39,720
And by 2010, we're up to 9.5 hours.

555
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:43,200
But there's still a really big sort of gender differences.

556
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:51,689
So the ratio of mothers time to father's time decreased from 7.6 in 1965 to 1.9 in 2010.

557
01:09:51,690 --> 01:10:01,470
But still, mothers are spending about twice as much time on total housework as married fathers in terms of core housework differences.

558
01:10:02,670 --> 01:10:07,440
In 1965, the ratio of mothers and fathers time was 19.1.

559
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:14,400
So married mothers were spending 20 times almost as much time on poor health work as Mary Fathers.

560
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:24,450
And then by 2022 and it was down to 3.3, but still three times as much, which is pretty substantial for other housework.

561
01:10:24,450 --> 01:10:33,150
The ratio went from 1.1 to 2.6, and it's about the only one where men are doing more.

562
01:10:33,810 --> 01:10:41,430
And with child care, the ratio went from 4.0 in 1965 to 1.9 in 2010.

563
01:10:42,870 --> 01:10:50,580
So there have been sort of decreases in the kind of inequality over time,

564
01:10:50,820 --> 01:10:59,160
but still pretty substantial differences between married mothers and fathers in terms of how much time they're spending on childcare and housework.

565
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:06,900
And this gets to that point that you're making about one of the benefits of marriage can be all that unpaid, unpaid labor there in the House.

566
01:11:08,870 --> 01:11:19,069
So here's some other data that include this is focused on working parents only,

567
01:11:19,070 --> 01:11:23,210
but this includes single parents as well as married parents that doesn't break them down.

568
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:35,299
So you can see here, this is the average hours that workers spent on combined work,

569
01:11:35,300 --> 01:11:40,970
household and caregiving activities on a workday from 2011 to 2016.

570
01:11:41,300 --> 01:11:50,570
And so this is per day. So mothers with a child under six spent 14.2 hours on their work activities and their paid work

571
01:11:50,570 --> 01:11:56,960
activities and unpaid work activities compared to 13.6 hours for fathers with a child under six.

572
01:11:57,650 --> 01:12:01,760
And then all workers spend an average of 11.1 8 hours.

573
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:14,390
So parents are definitely doing more work versus all workers and fathers are doing a huge amount more in this one, but still doing more.

574
01:12:17,810 --> 01:12:24,360
Oh. Okay. Any questions or comments?

575
01:12:26,010 --> 01:12:39,000
On that. I guess I forgot to ask you the question about, you know, when we talked about the things that make parenting sort of good for health.

576
01:12:40,020 --> 01:12:44,160
You know, one of the things was that labor is divided kind of equally.

577
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:52,890
So I think the implications of seeing that it's not mean that that that's that's kind of negative for health and that as

578
01:12:52,890 --> 01:13:00,990
we move toward more equality in terms of the division of labor that that could potentially be beneficial for population.

579
01:13:04,910 --> 01:13:10,820
So let's take a ten minute break and then when you come back, well, I'll give you a couple of options.

580
01:13:11,060 --> 01:13:19,700
So I'm going to during the break, assign your your make your reviewer assignments because we're going to spend

581
01:13:19,700 --> 01:13:24,650
the rest of the class doing your peer review for the first part of the paper.

582
01:13:24,890 --> 01:13:33,650
So you can stay here and do it here or you're welcome to go home or go to the computer lab or whatever if you want to work somewhere else.

583
01:13:33,980 --> 01:13:37,070
And I will stay here in case you have questions.

584
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:49,100
But yeah, so let's take about 10 minutes so that I can get the assignments made and then either come back or go home and it's due next Friday.

585
01:13:49,100 --> 01:13:55,370
So if you don't want to do it right now, you can also do it later. But just try to get it done by next Friday, okay?
