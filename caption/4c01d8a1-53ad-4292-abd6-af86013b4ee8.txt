1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:10,880
Furthermore, there are. This is how it works every.

2
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:25,680
Oh, yeah. You know.

3
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:59,450
Then we got our. I.

4
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:18,870
So I'm just going to give us about one more minute.

5
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:23,990
While people kind of stroll in. I know we're at time, but on the first day.

6
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:30,910
But another minute. You take?

7
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:52,890
So. When you think about it, when you go.

8
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:30,160
Six. Okay.

9
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:38,560
I think we'll get started. Good morning, everyone. How is everyone having, I guess having good start to the semester.

10
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:43,840
Yeah. Not great. So welcome to Public Health.

11
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:47,380
512 discussion. You're in section three.

12
00:02:47,410 --> 00:03:01,059
My name is Elise or just Anna? I'll be your GSI for the semester, and we'll go through some discussion guidelines and sort of not rules,

13
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:04,420
but like insights into into productive discussion today.

14
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:10,180
But it's a relatively short slide deck that I have, so it's likely that we'll get out before 1120.

15
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:14,670
So just so you know, any questions before we begin?

16
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:22,060
Everyone's in the right spot. Okay, great. So just briefly, like I said, my name is Analisa or just Ana.

17
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:30,790
I did my undergrad here as well at the University of Michigan, and I have a bachelor's in movement, science and Interdisciplinary Chemical Sciences.

18
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:35,260
Um, two subjects that are sort of related to public health, but not entirely.

19
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,479
I ended up here there like a job that I had at the university through the School of Public Health.

20
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:49,720
So I'm really excited to be in this program. My interest within epidemiology specifically are actually in mental health or psychiatric epidemiology.

21
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:56,590
And specifically, I'm interested in looking at correlates of mental health treatment, access and quality in disadvantaged populations.

22
00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:04,840
So that's sort of what my research focuses on. And I have applied to some programs post graduation, which is in the spring for me.

23
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:13,900
And then I'm also interested in government research at sort of the PhD route is, you know, not taken for lack of a better term.

24
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:22,810
I enjoy movies running. These are just some fun facts about me. Um, anyway, these are announcements.

25
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:30,099
I'll read through these and then if it's okay, just we can go around and I'd love to just like your names and then maybe like where you're from

26
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:34,839
or something exciting that happened to you in the past when we were over break or something,

27
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:38,080
if that works, just to kind of get to know you guys a little bit better.

28
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:45,040
So just a couple announcements and this will be largely reflective of what was covered in lecture on Tuesday.

29
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:51,320
So just so you guys know, all emails about the course should be sent to this public health, right?

30
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:54,520
I don't really know. It really stands for resident. I've no idea.

31
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:57,910
Email It's sort of like the broad course email.

32
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:05,620
I wish I knew what registered for and then but if anything's confidential or sensitive and you want to email us directly, my email is up there.

33
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:15,339
It's also on the canvas site. If you need course accommodations, you're welcome to send them again to the email or the teaching team.

34
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:18,370
We're working on getting those approved and as they come in.

35
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:20,950
So let me know if you have any questions about that.

36
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:27,370
And it is expected that you'll be in discussion to complete some work that we have to do every week together.

37
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:30,760
So if you're unable to attend, just let me know via email.

38
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:38,950
You know, you can email the rise where you would be slightly preferred if you e-mail me directly just because you know we're here together every week.

39
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:43,870
Can everyone hear me okay? My talking about it. Okay, great. Okay, great.

40
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,489
So this is like I said, we're going to get into some discussion stuff.

41
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:54,400
But first, if it's okay, especially because this is going to be a short hour or a short it might even be an hour together.

42
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:00,460
Let's go around and if that's okay. I know introductions are a little not fun sometimes, but I'd love to hear a little bit about you guys.

43
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:05,680
So we have a long room. Why don't we start?

44
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,899
Is there okay if we start here, let's just do a name and then program you're in.

45
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:16,610
Just because I know we come from a wide variety of backgrounds and then, um,

46
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:23,410
like one thing that's happened to you recently, and I feel, uh, I'm an HBCU.

47
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:26,410
Okay, I guess something's gonna happen.

48
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:30,430
I went to the Detroit Opera House for the first time. Oh, I've never been there.

49
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:35,500
Camille. Yes, hi. My name is Layla.

50
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:40,330
I'm key, and I guess that doesn't sound fun to y'all, but it was a blessing for me.

51
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:48,010
I got a procedure done for, um, excessive sweating over the break, so I'm happy to make you more concern for you.

52
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:51,760
I think you're. You're doing well. I'm doing well with both. Um, we.

53
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:57,070
Three. So great. Three. Thank you, Peter.

54
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:02,180
Yeah, we're both here. Um, hi, Jody.

55
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:07,990
I am from China. I'm a first year master's biostatistics student.

56
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:11,020
I don't know yet that it's interesting about that.

57
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:17,709
So my unit was flooded like the pipe was broken that night, and it was like very bloody Sunday at home.

58
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:21,190
They gave me to a hotel and I. Right.

59
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:26,280
Okay. I hope it gets fixed soon. Yeah, that's stressful.

60
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:31,160
Thank you for sharing. Uh. Hi.

61
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:34,700
I'm onshore. I'm, uh, my first year.

62
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:41,450
I'm at a certain age, a student. And something cool recently is that I'm not an 18 year old cat.

63
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:45,920
Oh, great. What is his name? Your name is Jessie.

64
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:49,580
Jessie Jackson on here. So she likes screams.

65
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:53,830
Okay, great.

66
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,010
Yeah, that's all. Hi, I'm Kristen.

67
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:06,260
I'm originally from Ohio. I'm a first year Alaska student, and, um, I guess something exciting that happened to have a break.

68
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:09,590
I finally got a new bookshelf. Oh, great.

69
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:15,790
That's exciting. Mhm. Hi. I'm my first year in this and plus ecology school.

70
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:20,740
Well, I spent the week in Fort Lauderdale, and I.

71
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:29,200
Oh, cool. Was it warm there or not so much because it was really windy and really the first few days were highly icy.

72
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:39,010
Okay, well, that's great. That's great. And, uh, my whole first year, I listened to, um, something fun.

73
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,980
I was in Dallas this week. Nice warm there. Yeah.

74
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:52,810
That's right. Hi, I'm Jenna. I'm a first year at Nice, and you just do something cool that happened.

75
00:08:54,830 --> 00:09:00,510
So. I am John.

76
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:04,650
I'm a senior in the B.S. program and something I did over the course.

77
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:09,270
Next for Michele Bachmann. Oh, what did you think?

78
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:13,190
What were your thoughts? Yeah. Did. Yes, I agreed.

79
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:17,990
I agreed. Why don't we. Yeah, we'll hear and then back, if that's okay.

80
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:21,940
Okay. Um, my name's Max. I'm a person here.

81
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:28,040
Um, and to be honest with anything fun, I got to second lead on the first day.

82
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:35,570
Um, I guess the most fun thing I did was I went with some friends for the New Year's Eve dinner, and it was fun.

83
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:39,509
Oh, great, great. I won my.

84
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:45,790
And she. And they said, can you. Something about getting a break.

85
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:55,090
I took the train from Los Angeles to travel for three days on the train, and I know the amazing people.

86
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:58,670
Oh, great. Wow, that's a long trip. Do you sleep on the train? Yes.

87
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,840
Okay. Okay, we'll go. Oh, sorry.

88
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:05,990
Yes. You have a lot of energy.

89
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:09,530
Yes. And I will find under maybe when we have.

90
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:21,900
On one hand, I'm a first year Fusion student in Massachusetts, although I'm from the.

91
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:27,309
Oh, great. What can I ask? What languages are from Korean?

92
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:30,950
Korean people? Um.

93
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:35,200
Uh, um. Yes, program. And I'm looking for.

94
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:40,270
I'm going to use with some of my friends. Oh, you say plural.

95
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:44,710
Are you going to do more than one? I don't know. Okay. Okay. I think it was, like 13.

96
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,239
Oh, interesting. That's right. Tomorrow is Friday the 13th.

97
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,450
I forgot. Yeah.

98
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:57,210
You know, that's really exciting, though. I'm busy.

99
00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:02,340
I'm a senior in the undergraduate B.S. program, and I also.

100
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:08,250
It was also disappointing. You know, we used to.

101
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:19,270
Oh, the Fiesta Bowl. Okay. Got it. My mama, I'm a first year and each being junior and my oldest brother got engaged recently.

102
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,219
So he's like the first in our family, like the first cousin to get engaged.

103
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:33,420
So we're all pretty excited. I'm pretty sure it's being tested in something.

104
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:39,510
I know something is going on. Are you going north to go skiing?

105
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:43,079
Okay. Hi. My name is Nina.

106
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:49,630
I'm a junior planning to study public health. And so I'm excited because I want to go out with some friends.

107
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:53,910
Cook I love it. I think my mom's from it. Oh, yeah, yeah.

108
00:11:55,410 --> 00:12:03,240
I'm Charisse. I'm a junior program here, and, um, I went snowboarding for the first time.

109
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,990
Did you also go north? Doesn't go snowboarding or a different state. Everyone.

110
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:13,530
I'm Andrew. I'm a I'm also a junior in the boys program.

111
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:19,149
And something fun I do for a break. My family likes to play a lot of board games, so we played a lot of.

112
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:25,290
Great, great. That was great.

113
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:29,790
Thank you. Hi, guys. I'm Andrea. I'm a junior in the bass program as well.

114
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:33,660
Um, I got you. Okay, great.

115
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:37,770
Great. That's what Dad used to. Yeah. Okay, cool.

116
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:45,120
Very cool. Very cool. Oh, I'm going to be obviously going to be a program at the house, so that's a good one.

117
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,469
That's a package workout. You got it. Hi.

118
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:53,380
I'm near the, um. I am a senior in the program and.

119
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:58,790
Yeah, that's great. And then I know. Is it to one here when you.

120
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:04,910
It's okay. We'll just do a brief introduction, like name a program and then exciting things happen.

121
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:09,230
Okay. Uh, my name's was on my, my senior year year program.

122
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:13,069
Um, I'm really. I'm just really.

123
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:16,490
I'm translating, but. I don't know. Oh, okay.

124
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:21,860
Okay. Arizona is where the feels more like in Arizona is where the Fiesta Bowl was.

125
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:27,079
Yeah. Is that where you were? I didn't go there. Oh, okay. Um, my name's Drug.

126
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:31,640
I'm a senior, and then, um, I spend time with my cousins from Seattle.

127
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:36,860
Okay. Thank you for going over those. It's good to get to know you guys a little bit more.

128
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:42,620
Okay, so like I said, we're going to go over a little bit about the course and what it will look like

129
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:47,570
in this room and talk a little bit about discussions together that we have.

130
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:54,469
So this discussion will be an opportunity to apply concepts that you've learned in lecture.

131
00:13:54,470 --> 00:14:02,690
And the prerecorded lecture videos that you watch will have some engage learning activities that will complete together and depending on the activity,

132
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:06,410
will usually go over the answers after we discuss in small groups.

133
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:11,920
Like I said, you'll earn credit for being here. So if you ever have to miss, just let me know via email.

134
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:18,410
We'll also discuss quizzes I believe their first quizzes do on the 16th of this month.

135
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:25,130
So. So we don't have one to discuss today, obviously, but when we do have quizzes to discuss, we'll review the answers.

136
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:29,330
And then later in the semester, we won't get to this yet, but we'll have small group work.

137
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:36,049
I'm looking at a research article together, um, a little bit more about the quizzes.

138
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:41,209
This was probably echoing information you already know, but there'll be ten questions for quiz.

139
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:44,600
They'll be completed outside of class time, so we won't go over them together.

140
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:52,040
In here, it's up with the answers. Once they're completed, they'll be multiple choice as well as looking from a dropdown was true or false.

141
00:14:52,670 --> 00:15:02,150
Sometimes short answer and sometimes calculations. You can take each with ones and collaborate with your peers, as Dr. Buxton said Tuesday.

142
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:10,340
So a little bit about discussions that we have in the classroom, this is sort of to just get us all started on the same footing.

143
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:15,979
And I'm sure you've, um, you're familiar with these sorts of guidelines and have had discussions in other classes.

144
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:23,389
But just to sort of recap, so of course we're a large group that comes from a lot of different backgrounds.

145
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:31,250
So you know, it's sort of expected that or encourage that everyone can, you know, share their perspective and share their experiences.

146
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:37,159
And so we hope to hear from everyone, even if you're quiet or more, you know, more shy.

147
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:40,460
I hope that you have a chance to speak this semester often.

148
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:46,910
Um, listening respectfully, this is kind of a given, you know, it goes a long way, I think, to.

149
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:55,100
To, uh, you know, show the person that you're speaking to, that you're listening and that you're, you know, reflecting on what they're saying.

150
00:15:55,100 --> 00:16:03,530
So listening respectfully, is important. Um, like you said, we have a lot of different ideas and perspectives, so, you know,

151
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:10,160
be open to learning something new from someone around you, um, and considering different points of view.

152
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:16,579
Um, we are all human involving mistakes.

153
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:21,350
So, you know, just understanding that this is a safe space for learning and, you know, making mistakes,

154
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:29,329
of course, understanding that you have an affect, your words have an effect on others.

155
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:34,520
And what you say, you know, is, is, um, you know, important.

156
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:42,860
And so it's important to, to not use disrespectful, of course, or marginalizing language, take group work seriously.

157
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:47,629
Um, this is a big part of this course is, is group work and discussion.

158
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:52,370
So just remember that, um, a lot of learning takes place in this room and, um,

159
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:58,490
through the group work that we do, uh, let's see this kind of set already.

160
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,639
Um, assumptions and generalizations.

161
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:10,400
Um, you know, I would just be careful about, um, you know, making generalizations or making assumptions based on your own experience.

162
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:15,750
There's this one of my classmates always when we're talking about discussion, guidelines, research, there's this sort of mean not we.

163
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:16,549
So, you know,

164
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:23,240
speaking from your own experience doesn't necessarily mean that people even with a shared identity as you have sort of those same experiences.

165
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:28,819
So, um, I always remember me not making an effort to get to know other students.

166
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:35,270
I think we sort of had a good interaction here today, so hopefully we can continue that throughout the semester.

167
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:43,519
Um, and then again, just understanding that there are many different ways to solve problems and think about different public health topics.

168
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:52,540
So listening respectfully and being open to different approaches and of course, um, this is just, I did not put this out here.

169
00:17:52,550 --> 00:18:00,960
Someone else put this in your. But just again, that, you know, the things that we can see in each other are not our whole identities.

170
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:08,370
And so making sure that we're being very respectful of the stressors which I know you guys are public health professionals.

171
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,420
I know you will be okay.

172
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:18,350
Getting to know you. Okay. So we did this a little bit already, but there is a survey that I would appreciate if you could complete.

173
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:23,079
So if your laptops are not out, I'll give you a couple of minutes to take them out and complete the survey.

174
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:26,080
It's just more about sort of what you're hoping to get out.

175
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:30,940
Of course, previous experiences and it's relatively brief.

176
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:37,330
If you have any trouble accessing it, please let me know these slides in this link is via canvas.

177
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:43,000
It's in week one discussion for week one of the course modules.

178
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:54,420
So it's 1018 now. We'll try and reconvene at like 1023.

179
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:10,880
Okay. It's 1023. Everyone feel like they had a good time.

180
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:15,050
It's okay if he's still working. So working.

181
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:19,010
Done. Still working. Still working. Okay.

182
00:23:19,250 --> 00:25:09,560
I've got a couple more minutes. Then you would need a couple more minutes.

183
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:17,300
Pretty good. Okay. Okay, great. So this is just the last part of our time together today.

184
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:24,500
It's going to be like a 25 minute discussion with maybe in groups of, like, two or three or four.

185
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:34,610
And just as like a lead into our discussion, I want to just introduce we all know COVID very well by now, and all have, of course,

186
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:42,350
been through a really tough time these past few years with COVID in our lives and affecting school and work and everything.

187
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:52,490
And I just want to. So these are a compilation of different news headlines about COVID masking policies.

188
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:55,370
And one thing, a couple of things that I want to point out.

189
00:25:55,370 --> 00:26:06,230
One is that just sort of the use of epidemiology in informing these sort of safety measures that were rolled out at various times during the pandemic.

190
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:10,489
And then secondly, just the contrast between a lot of these headlines.

191
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:16,160
So you see that, you know, in some parts of the year, these were both from on late 2022,

192
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:21,170
this was from 2023, so just this month and then this was back in 2020.

193
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:29,930
So you can just see like between year and month how much these guidelines varied especially and this is just in mask wearing.

194
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:35,719
You know, of course, vaccination policies and guidelines changed a lot over the course of the pandemic.

195
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:38,990
And this is just sort of to to illustrate that.

196
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:52,700
And so this is the list of discussion questions that I'd like you guys to go over in small groups, like I said, then maybe 2 to 4 people per group.

197
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:56,900
So just thinking about where people get their public health news from.

198
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,470
Advantages and disadvantages of different sources of news.

199
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:07,940
Um, should we be concerned about information overload? You know, about these different and varying guidelines that we see sometimes?

200
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:14,810
How should we address conflicting information? And in these situations, what are our roles as public health professionals?

201
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:22,429
And um, yes. And so we've already introduced ourselves, but feel for you too in small groups sort of reintroduces us.

202
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:27,890
I feel people are kind of sitting maybe near people they know. So if you don't feel the need, you know, certainly you don't have to.

203
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:33,770
If there's one person in a group who feels comfortable sharing at the end of the 25 minutes, that would be great.

204
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:38,719
But I know sometimes different people like to share, so if you don't want just one spokesperson,

205
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,740
that's okay and then will reconvene, like I said, in 25 minutes.

206
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:52,700
So at about, um, 52, 1052 and talk about the things we discussed, that sounds good.

207
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:59,900
Okay. Um, so anyone have concerns about getting into groups like, I think maybe.

208
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:05,150
Yeah, maybe like proximity is what I'm thinking, like proximity to people around you.

209
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:14,480
Okay, I'm going to. You may do you may discuss this.

210
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:23,700
Yeah. Are you?

211
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:37,470
Yeah. If you're gonna make a run down here, I'm not going to be.

212
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:52,710
Don't think it's going to happen to me.

213
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:57,810
I don't care anything for you.

214
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:09,920
Yeah, I would agree with that. Yeah. And then I was like, What does it mean that you were looking for a way to go for an elevator ride?

215
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:25,370
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

216
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:29,530
So I felt like.

217
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:40,180
I was like. And I really am hungry, either me or my family right now.

218
00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:52,220
So if you like me and I like.

219
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:56,910
I love you. My. I don't know.

220
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:02,100
How was your life able to make you ready to go?

221
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:18,010
There's not much followed by the end of this year or so.

222
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:37,210
And about this year I was just thinking about what you are and what I look like.

223
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:45,050
It's hard. Right now, I nearly die.

224
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:56,770
I guess I. I have all the issues.

225
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:04,730
I remember something like that. Yeah, that's I why.

226
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:08,530
You know, a lot of things to come out of.

227
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:16,150
Something might not work for you, right?

228
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:44,120
Which one are you? And what did you want to know?

229
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:54,590
Yeah, about a lot of things during Hurricane Katrina.

230
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:36,070
It wasn't her fault that something was wrong.

231
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:43,890
I was close to.

232
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:49,770
To know.

233
00:32:50,810 --> 00:33:01,230
And so my mother. The problem with what's happening with.

234
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:13,220
You know how you.

235
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:24,420
It's crazy that I remember the day I walked out.

236
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:48,140
I hear you're a little older here anyway, so I would say keep an eye on that.

237
00:33:50,050 --> 00:33:53,670
Yeah. You can.

238
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:05,330
I just feel like every day I don't really get like really good customer service.

239
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:12,410
And I was wondering how things even having to worry.

240
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:28,240
And I look at my article like one thing I remember like I'm not people were like, Yeah, like something important.

241
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:39,130
I don't want to say no, but there are. Like a lot of.

242
00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:54,100
But now, yes, I feel like I have a right to have my daughter.

243
00:34:54,500 --> 00:35:26,410
I don't have the right to wear one because every time I go to work, I know it's a little like, oh, very much like doing nothing.

244
00:35:27,690 --> 00:36:02,220
I don't be like. Isn't it fair to say that they were very different place?

245
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:06,350
Well, you know, nine years ago I was a lawyer.

246
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:41,030
I think that I realized that I really I really wanted to talk about how I was really like how I was raised on those issues.

247
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:49,400
And there was a focus on every point that really.

248
00:36:55,360 --> 00:37:19,190
Your personal life is important. There is always reality that it doesn't seem like you guys have a very difficult situation in Syria.

249
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:49,560
I think we can all come together and have had a great point in the article for an interview that I want to do.

250
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:54,810
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

251
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:13,070
Yeah. There's just no way you're going to get that sense of smell, like, in your skin.

252
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:25,210
Like, yeah, I thought we, like, distinguish between credible and that's what most people have.

253
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:31,710
Cause. Looks like that for me.

254
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:39,960
I know an easy route.

255
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:58,480
I know he's a role model, but I think, like I said, you're just to going to get more.

256
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:13,520
The people that live in North Carolina. Like myself.

257
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:24,570
I was like, I'm like, yo, yo, yo, yo.

258
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:29,600
I know. You know, like, I know. Have, like, really?

259
00:39:34,650 --> 00:39:40,600
But I thought it might be like.

260
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:51,770
Yeah. How you doing? Yeah, probably pretty crappy.

261
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:10,470
Exactly. Yeah. What are some of the other places like that?

262
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:29,920
Operate under the premise that we still ask you to follow up with.

263
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:48,370
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

264
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:57,700
In this letter you write about my son plans to live with Maria.

265
00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:01,100
I don't know where they would be.

266
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:10,810
Like, you know, I mean, I guess I.

267
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:21,050
So they are really. Yeah, I think.

268
00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:36,980
Yes. I feel like have a problem with it.

269
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:41,540
My mind. There.

270
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:50,510
Really? But I think also we have to wait for other people.

271
00:41:55,090 --> 00:42:09,330
Yeah. What is going on in your work?

272
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:16,150
Yeah. I don't really know what to do about it.

273
00:42:17,650 --> 00:42:31,080
What would you do? You know, I think I'll do it anyway.

274
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:56,140
Oh, right, right, right, right, right, right.

275
00:42:56,580 --> 00:43:01,440
Yeah. Because I think a lot of like.

276
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:17,370
I was lucky. Unfortunately for her, I wouldn't put it behind her.

277
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:38,420
But we were just waiting for the right to think because they just kept going around, like, right now.

278
00:43:39,890 --> 00:43:43,490
Oh, yeah, me too. I worried about it when you go abroad.

279
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:54,970
Yeah. I didn't even have a.

280
00:44:00,570 --> 00:44:04,060
You are everywhere. Everybody here.

281
00:44:06,290 --> 00:44:09,880
You. I'm in the middle of it.

282
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:25,650
I like the know that, you know, you know what's happening.

283
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:38,240
I thought, you know, my. You're not getting it from me.

284
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:58,060
What we have. Also, I want to tell you something that would like to know a lot of people want to look into like.

285
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:04,680
Until December 2nd.

286
00:45:06,090 --> 00:45:11,040
I was in my early. Oh yeah.

287
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:19,730
When it was sort of like having a really.

288
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:32,940
I love it. I like it.

289
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:40,290
And if you don't it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

290
00:45:43,150 --> 00:45:47,580
But not one year after I run.

291
00:45:50,290 --> 00:45:51,580
It might be a little bit late.

292
00:45:53,860 --> 00:46:07,040
We have about five or whatever it is we have about I don't want to interrupt, but I hear some groups sort of wrapping up their conversations.

293
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:12,190
I don't want to interrupt them. So do we feel like five more minutes is needed or.

294
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:18,250
I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt. I'm sorry. Is five more minutes good or should we reconvene?

295
00:46:18,490 --> 00:46:21,650
How are people feeling? 45 more minutes.

296
00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:25,210
I especially don't want to interrupt any ongoing conversations.

297
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:28,870
We're good. Good. We're going to reconvene. Okay, great.

298
00:46:29,230 --> 00:46:33,250
And then we can get out. You know, whenever we we wrap up the court, the class discussion.

299
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:39,480
So let's talk about what what sorts of things you guys were discussing.

300
00:46:39,490 --> 00:46:44,020
So let's just kind of go down the line. But if we veer off course a little bit, that's okay, too.

301
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:49,310
So I was hearing a lot of discussion about where people get their news.

302
00:46:49,330 --> 00:46:54,190
Does anyone want to share some of those ideas with the group?

303
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:59,560
Yes, I think for us, we mainly you, mainly local news or just like what's on your phone?

304
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:04,600
Yeah. Apple News. Yeah.

305
00:47:04,810 --> 00:47:09,410
When you say local, can you describe what you mean by local outbreak?

306
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,560
Oh, sure. I think they control schools or county.

307
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:17,740
Um, I think they required schools to mask up.

308
00:47:18,370 --> 00:47:22,330
Oh, yeah. Oh, absolutely. Absolutely.

309
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:26,200
Other ideas where we put our news local sources.

310
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:32,800
Yes. We said it seems like a lot of people get their news from social media platforms or Twitter or Facebook.

311
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:40,210
Absolutely. Absolutely. Other we have social media, local news, Apple News, any other.

312
00:47:40,510 --> 00:47:45,550
Yes. I forgot to mention also, although I would say it's like an age thing, too.

313
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:49,330
Yes, that's a great point.

314
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:56,760
Oh, you have it all on our phones.

315
00:47:56,770 --> 00:48:03,000
Yeah, absolutely. I think TV versus social media does where we have like an age component associated with it.

316
00:48:03,010 --> 00:48:07,510
Yeah. Others that we haven't covered yet. Yes, I know.

317
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:14,440
They're just kind of like word of mouth, especially in really tight knit communities where a young person hear something from like another source,

318
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:18,220
like a social media platform and then spreads that to the other people in the community.

319
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:22,000
Yeah, absolutely. Completely agree. It's a great one.

320
00:48:23,050 --> 00:48:27,890
Others that haven't been said. Cool.

321
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:35,980
Those are all great. I completely agree. And I'm trying to think if we didn't cover any like radio, but, you know, not a ton of people listened.

322
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,819
I mean, certainly many people listen to the radio and now I think is also like an age thing,

323
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:46,280
maybe depending on sort of where what you just listened to in the car or at home.

324
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:50,300
Advantages and disadvantages of sources.

325
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:58,610
Do, um, does the group have thoughts on, you know, what are, what are good things about some versus versus bad things about other sources?

326
00:49:01,990 --> 00:49:08,260
Yes. Well, we saw that it's really easy to get access to the Internet or like social media, you know,

327
00:49:08,290 --> 00:49:12,670
so like anybody that has like Internet or like devices is able to access that information.

328
00:49:13,060 --> 00:49:17,020
But disadvantages is it's really hard to know what which sources are credible and which are.

329
00:49:17,170 --> 00:49:23,680
You know, a lot of people take a lot of social media at face value without like looking to see if it's credible or not.

330
00:49:23,830 --> 00:49:29,100
Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. I know I heard some other groups discussing similar topics.

331
00:49:29,110 --> 00:49:33,280
Yeah. Other thoughts on advantages and disadvantages.

332
00:49:34,870 --> 00:49:46,240
Yeah. Um, I know like on social media personally, twitter is where I find out everything they have, like the COVID 19 tab on Twitter.

333
00:49:46,630 --> 00:49:55,360
But most of the resources there are like national sources, like they're talking about COVID broadly across the country rather than locally.

334
00:49:55,600 --> 00:50:01,330
Right. So you kind of miss out on what's going on in your community if that's like the only way to get your business.

335
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:09,430
Mhm. Absolutely. Absolutely. And like is that tab, I'm not super familiar with Twitter, but like is that how do you know,

336
00:50:09,430 --> 00:50:15,759
does it like get rid of articles that are certain like uh, uh, age, do you know what I mean?

337
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:21,610
Like one. Yeah. So like it updates like every day and then it also has like live updates.

338
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:32,200
Mhm. And then it, I like from what I've seen it only like the sources are like the CDC, CNN,

339
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:41,930
ABC like the only news sources I see rather than sort of like just random tweets from random people.

340
00:50:41,950 --> 00:50:46,650
Got it. And only like a verified social network that has got it makes sense.

341
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:53,220
These are great other advantages. Disadvantages. Yes.

342
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:59,450
I guess since nowadays, like a lot of news is on like social media and stuff, it's very like,

343
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:04,080
uh, active and like the minute there's like a breaking news story, um, it's like, spread.

344
00:51:04,530 --> 00:51:10,709
Yes, yes, yes, yes. And do you think I'm going to sort of ask a follow up question?

345
00:51:10,710 --> 00:51:15,750
Do you think that, like, the quicker it spreads, the better in some cases or in all cases?

346
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:19,320
Like, do you have that on that if you don't?

347
00:51:19,530 --> 00:51:27,000
Oh, I think it's generally good because it's more like widely disseminated.

348
00:51:27,330 --> 00:51:32,250
Oh, sure. Right. So I genuinely I feel like there's no right answer.

349
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:34,559
Yeah, I'm just genuinely curious. Yeah, I would say,

350
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:41,310
like a disadvantage of it's pretty fast is like fear mongering I'm sure depending on like the news outlet and

351
00:51:41,310 --> 00:51:49,770
the writer what their actual purposes cause like I know in our campus experience like our first COVID case,

352
00:51:49,770 --> 00:51:53,760
like everybody knew about it before the university actually said something.

353
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:57,740
So that just cause like a bunch of panic and silence. Absolutely.

354
00:51:57,830 --> 00:52:01,550
I'm sorry. Do I? I hope I didn't. Oh, that was the timer.

355
00:52:02,590 --> 00:52:04,770
Did I cut you off? I hope I didn't. I didn't know.

356
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:13,320
But I also just thought, like, I guess a, um, a source since, like, uh, it's widely disseminated so fast.

357
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:17,880
If it's like, spreading misinformation, that can also spread really fast, but you have to negative.

358
00:52:17,910 --> 00:52:22,590
Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. Other advantages.

359
00:52:22,590 --> 00:52:28,229
Disadvantages. And I guess we sort of started to touch on this already.

360
00:52:28,230 --> 00:52:31,230
But should we be concerned about information overload?

361
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:38,070
Like does anyone have any would be examples from the COVID 19 pandemic where maybe family members or friends were concerned about all these different,

362
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:41,440
you know, sources they were hearing about. Or maybe you have a different example.

363
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:49,110
Yeah. Uh, my last semester, which I found miscommunication about some of the problematic issues that were actually at the CDC was Wisconsin.

364
00:52:49,110 --> 00:52:54,280
So, um, mainly around like, just something like the masking stuff.

365
00:52:54,370 --> 00:52:58,500
Yeah. My parents on cloth masks were actually not good enough anymore.

366
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:07,110
Mm hmm. Um, like, that was kind of a hard. Like a heart turned the CDC had to make was like, um, the last word out of us.

367
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:11,520
Whatever they put in that was shown to be very ineffective, especially among people.

368
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:15,700
Very hard for people to adapt.

369
00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:19,450
And again, right down to when they were on. Mhm.

370
00:53:19,610 --> 00:53:26,300
Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. I think building off of that and finally addressing the next question a little bit too with you talked a lot about

371
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:33,260
what happens when the general public sees the recommendations change and how like when we get more evidence,

372
00:53:33,530 --> 00:53:41,690
what we do as a field is we change our recommendations and um, we, you know, say, hey, what we did before, that's wrong, we're gonna do this now.

373
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:49,980
But it's easy to understand how from the general public, I would feel like a lot of distrust and also like would cause for the field of public health

374
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:55,010
to lose some of its legitimacy because it can be perceived as like backtracking basically.

375
00:53:55,280 --> 00:54:01,790
Right. Absolutely. I think that was especially such a hard thing to tackle in the pandemic just because things were changing so rapidly.

376
00:54:01,910 --> 00:54:03,649
Yeah, I do.

377
00:54:03,650 --> 00:54:11,330
Thoughts on um, I think that was a great segway into addressing conflicting information and how to deal with, with too much information, so to speak.

378
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:22,690
Their idea. Yeah. Um, I think what I would talk about, like on what social media platforms are doing, we're like do have a little fact checkers.

379
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:26,799
Mhm. Like, um, like with videos. Yeah. You can do like.

380
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:30,210
Um. But I feel like certain things.

381
00:54:30,610 --> 00:54:34,000
Yeah, which I do. I guess maybe something like that. Right.

382
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:37,630
And I'm sorry, did you say that that was on, like, social media?

383
00:54:38,050 --> 00:54:42,130
Yeah. I'm particularly, like, on an individual basis. Might that be sure?

384
00:54:42,610 --> 00:54:46,660
Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely.

385
00:54:47,290 --> 00:54:54,009
These are great. And then finally, I think we also just naturally have covered this a little bit,

386
00:54:54,010 --> 00:55:00,069
but our roles as public health professionals and sort of making sure that people

387
00:55:00,070 --> 00:55:05,200
know what the safest route for them is or what the best sort of case or sorry,

388
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:11,800
what the best practices are when, when approaching these different, um, sort of information that we disseminate.

389
00:55:12,070 --> 00:55:16,060
Does anyone have any other sort of concluding thoughts maybe on the topic?

390
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:27,559
Yeah. Well, that's a huge question. Yeah, absolutely.

391
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:34,060
So just this last one I'm focusing on about sort of our role as public health professionals and how we can sort of, um.

392
00:55:34,130 --> 00:55:42,290
I guess for me, like I always, um, you know, during the COVID pandemic, especially, I think it was, it was and maybe some people share my thoughts.

393
00:55:42,290 --> 00:55:45,380
It was a little frustrating, right, to like, you know, hear about, you know,

394
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:48,919
confusion even more from my family members or friends about, you know, what they can do.

395
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:51,829
And, you know, as like public health people, I think we can often,

396
00:55:51,830 --> 00:55:57,110
like sort through information ourselves and sort of pass through what is and isn't important.

397
00:55:57,110 --> 00:56:01,219
But, you know, what can we do to help maybe other people and and broadly,

398
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:06,380
you know, large populations of people maybe to to help process this information?

399
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:17,059
Yeah. Yeah. I can't really speak to like the population level or because I don't have a very hard it's like at the individual level,

400
00:56:17,060 --> 00:56:22,549
I work with people like individuals a lot and like kind of like a whole coaching setting.

401
00:56:22,550 --> 00:56:27,330
And so there's a lot of misinformation and I guess just um, uh,

402
00:56:27,770 --> 00:56:32,569
being okay with the fact that you're not going to change someone's worldview overnight is important.

403
00:56:32,570 --> 00:56:41,200
Like we talked about patience a lot and also, uh, just planting like educational seeds.

404
00:56:41,230 --> 00:56:46,850
Um, I think the more that you shot someone down and say that they're wrong, let's open.

405
00:56:46,850 --> 00:56:54,139
They're going to be teaching alternative ideas. So I'm just really, like, being patient and planting the seeds.

406
00:56:54,140 --> 00:57:02,030
Um, and, yeah, you just have to be okay with the fact that you're not going to change someone's perspective in a matter of hours or night.

407
00:57:02,090 --> 00:57:05,760
Absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah.

408
00:57:06,020 --> 00:57:11,360
And I talked about making like specifically, like I think the more like complicated or rigorous,

409
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:17,750
like I can make information more accessible and also like the importance of like translating a lot of that information.

410
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:21,739
So like it can be disseminated the. Yeah, absolutely.

411
00:57:21,740 --> 00:57:25,220
Like on a broader scale. Absolutely. Yeah.

412
00:57:25,730 --> 00:57:30,290
Um, I know like a lot of schools are starting to try,

413
00:57:30,290 --> 00:57:34,399
especially like younger elementary middle school are trying to incorporate fact

414
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:38,510
checking and learning where your news or sources are coming from in your curriculum.

415
00:57:38,510 --> 00:57:44,479
Oh, they're starting from a young age where we can actually teach individuals critical thinking about where they're getting information.

416
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:47,209
That's important. Yeah, that's great. I didn't know that.

417
00:57:47,210 --> 00:57:53,750
Um, yeah, I think these things together are also important, like in smaller conversations, just understanding that things don't change overnight,

418
00:57:53,750 --> 00:57:58,430
but also, you know, making these resources more broadly available and even beginning to educate.

419
00:57:58,430 --> 00:58:04,490
I think education came up over here, um, about sort of how to process information can be very important as well.

420
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:11,520
Any concluding thoughts? This was great. Great.

421
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:15,100
And then just briefly, I mean, this is the wall that's left.

422
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:20,850
But any questions before we sort of depart for the week for me or, you know, I'll be here.

423
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:26,860
Yes. For your next meeting. We'll talk more about it. But we will we'll we'll go over the questions.

424
00:58:27,060 --> 00:58:31,430
Yeah. Mm hmm. Great. Thank you.

425
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:41,740
Thank you. Thank you. But you.

426
00:58:49,230 --> 00:59:11,530
Enjoying. I don't know what to tell you about how I was feeling.

427
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:28,400
Well, I must have been for you, and I know I'm not.

428
00:59:31,910 --> 00:59:38,460
But I'm going to prove it to you. Yeah, you should.

429
00:59:38,750 --> 00:59:43,940
Yeah. I don't think I would do that. Haven't you?

430
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:59,160
You mean like it's over? With 142.

431
00:59:59,290 --> 01:00:06,530
What's your name? What do you got for me?

432
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:15,270
Oh, I love you, man.

433
01:00:15,310 --> 01:00:20,300
Yeah. Okay. She knew I worked in the same floor.

434
01:00:20,350 --> 01:00:34,150
Okay. Okay. I have in each of my life, I usually have a weird sort of black, and they don't have the advantages of introducing yourself.

435
01:00:36,140 --> 01:00:40,870
I've never taken it, which is why I didn't deserve it.

436
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:44,700
You could have tested out. Okay. Okay. Got it. That's probably why.

437
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:48,650
What is not right for the public.

438
01:00:51,190 --> 01:00:54,350
I love you. I love you.

439
01:00:55,290 --> 01:00:59,300
I love you.

440
01:01:02,110 --> 01:01:07,800
I don't know why I am.

441
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:15,370
You know, you can talk about your research.

442
01:01:16,810 --> 01:01:21,040
Really? Seriously. Oh, I'm. Yeah, I'm still working on it.

443
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:24,790
And also, by the way, I meant to say, I'm so sorry to hear about your past.

444
01:01:24,790 --> 01:01:30,459
If there's anything that, you know, while you're sort of getting all of that in life, please let me know how I can accommodate that.

445
01:01:30,460 --> 01:01:33,370
That's very nice of you. Absolutely. Absolutely.

446
01:01:33,580 --> 01:01:41,920
But, yes, my research, it focuses a lot on how mental health care I guess there's two there's two things.

447
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:47,709
So one of them is mental health. There was a far I'm doing a bad job of explaining this.

448
01:01:47,710 --> 01:01:51,220
There was a mental health intervention that was delivered to high schools in Michigan.

449
01:01:51,220 --> 01:01:55,090
This was sort of an ra1 like a big sort of grand place project.

450
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:59,139
And this was in like 2018. So now we're just analyzing the data for it.

451
01:01:59,140 --> 01:02:04,750
But a lot of it is sort of how this mental health program worked and how it was implemented in the

452
01:02:04,750 --> 01:02:09,760
school and how it impacted students mental health outcomes like their depression and anxiety.

453
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:17,110
So I do a lot of work with data analysis for that project. And then I'm also working on a project related to older adults in transitioning into

454
01:02:17,110 --> 01:02:20,920
nursing homes and sort of their mental health outcomes during that transition.

455
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:24,700
Yes, I am very interested in. Yeah. Oh, cool.

456
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:28,450
Personally, I have like a general anxiety disorder.

457
01:02:28,510 --> 01:02:32,770
Oh, sure. No, I was watching this painting in the in the in a research.

458
01:02:32,770 --> 01:02:39,880
This one. Oh, yes. I feel like they're collecting my information from the cell phone and over here.

459
01:02:39,940 --> 01:02:48,340
Oh, sure. Absolutely. Like if I. But it gets me into just knowing generally more of like researching mental health.

460
01:02:48,370 --> 01:02:51,880
Yeah, I love that. I try to get involved in research when I can't as well.

461
01:02:51,890 --> 01:02:56,290
Yeah. Just sort of, you know, give back to the research that we do.

462
01:02:56,290 --> 01:03:01,089
Yeah. Yes, it is. You're doing like epidemiology and.

463
01:03:01,090 --> 01:03:04,180
Yeah. So in the second year MPH in general.

464
01:03:04,180 --> 01:03:11,620
Epidemiologist Yeah. So it's more like surveillance overtaking or like the general public is.

465
01:03:12,550 --> 01:03:19,629
So yeah. So I would say epidemiology is is a great and interesting combination of both surveillance and sort of looking at what you were saying,

466
01:03:19,630 --> 01:03:23,260
prevalence and incidence of mental disorders in the populations.

467
01:03:23,260 --> 01:03:31,629
But it's also sort of we look at as epidemiologists like causal pathways between, you know, exposures and mental health outcomes.

468
01:03:31,630 --> 01:03:33,880
So it's a very interesting yeah.

469
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:43,680
Field when you say exposure is so yeah it's like water, chemical or environmental exposure are like more like a social, right?

470
01:03:43,990 --> 01:03:51,219
That's no, that's a that's an excellent question. So typically in in the in the part of epidemiology that I'm in, it's typically social.

471
01:03:51,220 --> 01:03:58,270
So, you know, being exposed to even even your upbringing, you know, in your home or, or, you know,

472
01:03:58,270 --> 01:04:03,280
how much education you've attained or something like this as opposed to more chemical exposures.

473
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:09,160
Um, would certainly be epidemiologists to focus on just typically, I don't see it as much in the, in the work I do.

474
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:15,160
Um, yeah, I just, I would just like, like to tell me a little bit more.

475
01:04:15,220 --> 01:04:21,220
Yeah, I would be happy to. I was recently looking at like Japanese nursing homes.

476
01:04:21,220 --> 01:04:29,730
I was just that watching some videos. They are mentioning that the others are having anxiety like depression or medication.

477
01:04:29,820 --> 01:04:35,240
Absolutely. Absolutely. I yeah. I don't know about their populations yet.

478
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:44,309
Yeah, I'm absolutely. This is also interesting. And can you remind me also what your background is in and what are you in terms of education?

479
01:04:44,310 --> 01:04:49,240
Are you a master's student here or are you that that's zero master's student in biostatistics.

480
01:04:50,010 --> 01:04:53,069
Okay. Okay. I would love to if you would be interested.

481
01:04:53,070 --> 01:04:56,660
We can set up like a like a meeting at some point, if that would work for you.

482
01:04:56,670 --> 01:04:59,430
Also, you're welcome to drop by office hours at any time.

483
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:03,690
And then also, you know, if you're interested in getting more involved in mental health research here,

484
01:05:03,690 --> 01:05:09,659
I have a couple of good contacts that I could maybe, you know, put you in touch with, if that's something I of course, you know, no pressure.

485
01:05:09,660 --> 01:05:18,190
But if you're interested. Yes, I'm interested. Okay. Yeah. I mean, I like hopefully if I have resources, but I'm in general,

486
01:05:18,190 --> 01:05:25,840
I'm just like knowing a little bit more and I'm more like, I don't know since I'm biostatistics.

487
01:05:25,850 --> 01:05:31,380
So I want to know what can I do as a physician about mental health.

488
01:05:31,430 --> 01:05:36,310
Yeah, but absolutely I, I know like a couple of faculty members in.

489
01:05:36,390 --> 01:05:41,070
But there are more. I think there are more. Like I was in high esteem those.

490
01:05:41,970 --> 01:05:45,870
Sure, sure. Yeah. And that's so interesting.

491
01:05:45,870 --> 01:05:47,339
I would love to talk to you more about this.

492
01:05:47,340 --> 01:05:53,440
I haven't actually ever met someone in biostatistics or like in the biostatistics program who has mental health interests.

493
01:05:53,790 --> 01:06:01,529
Um, but that's not to say that I don't work with a lot of people who have very sort of biostatistics focused interest that overlap with mental health.

494
01:06:01,530 --> 01:06:10,440
So I think I can definitely, you know, or I should say, hopefully connect you to some resources that that would be helpful and hopefully exciting.

495
01:06:10,980 --> 01:06:18,150
And yeah, I might like to apply by like your office I was oh power hungry be like can I talk to you.

496
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:21,959
Yeah please do you have my email? Would it be helpful?

497
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:25,140
Is there anything I can do, like write down for you or anything or.

498
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:28,410
No, it's. And your your point, right? It is.

499
01:06:28,710 --> 01:06:32,910
Yeah. And yes. So, so yeah. Maybe I'll write to some.

500
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:39,300
That would be great. I would love to hear from you. You said you were working with the data already collected.

501
01:06:40,810 --> 01:06:43,320
Yeah. So the. I'm sorry. Go ahead.

502
01:06:43,330 --> 01:06:53,200
I don't want to cut you off without, you know, it's like we are learning about how to deal with data, but I don't know what kind of data is like.

503
01:06:53,460 --> 01:06:57,590
Qualitative or continuum is more. Sure. Survey.

504
01:06:58,570 --> 01:07:06,370
Yeah, absolutely. So I will say that the projects that I'm involved in, especially with someone here, is with Dr. Brian MESSICK.

505
01:07:07,060 --> 01:07:14,920
So that's who I work with a lot. And I would say the data that she uses is oftentimes from what we call like nationally representative survey.

506
01:07:14,940 --> 01:07:24,940
So like there's a couple you may have heard of like in Haines or even, um, even like census data can be used in public health research sometimes.

507
01:07:25,690 --> 01:07:31,120
And so a lot of times the data is already collected and ready for us to use, which is super nice.

508
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:34,590
And we just sort of have to analyze it in the ways that we're interested in.

509
01:07:34,790 --> 01:07:37,479
In other in other projects I've been a part of,

510
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:43,690
it's actually like we do the data collection and sometimes that's through like survey, like Qualtrics surveys.

511
01:07:43,690 --> 01:07:50,319
If you're familiar with Qualtrics or even like telephone surveys, yeah,

512
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:54,280
it's a good it's a really interesting mix of like quantitative and qualitative data.

513
01:07:54,280 --> 01:08:00,460
Um, and typically as we, as you and I both know, like opinion bias stats are usually quantitative.

514
01:08:00,730 --> 01:08:07,059
And so when I come across like qualitative projects, it's a very interesting sort of perspective that,

515
01:08:07,060 --> 01:08:12,310
you know, it gets in one way or another incorporate it into the analysis.

516
01:08:12,730 --> 01:08:21,400
Yes, I would like to hear more of that. Um, move to the second question is that there is a engagement engaging.

517
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:26,800
I don't know. They, they gave points based on. Mm hmm.

518
01:08:26,830 --> 01:08:38,290
Sure. So from my understanding, it is the degree that you get in here is an engagement grade, however it can be erm sort of, you know,

519
01:08:38,470 --> 01:08:44,799
it doesn't necessarily mean that you necessarily need to share with the class but rather just like what we're doing today in engaging in discussion.

520
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:49,330
And I could see that you were contributing a lot and you know, everyone's doing a really good job of contributing.

521
01:08:49,570 --> 01:08:53,229
So, um, but yes, please. I'm sorry. I hope I didn't interrupt you.

522
01:08:53,230 --> 01:09:00,070
Did you have more of that question? Sorry. No, no, I was just wondering how that is.

523
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:03,520
Like, how how do you get points? Sure. Sure.

524
01:09:04,420 --> 01:09:09,249
So in full transparency, this is the first discussion that I taught for this class.

525
01:09:09,250 --> 01:09:14,860
And so I will look into this a bit further, just so I can give you a much clearer answer.

526
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:23,829
But from what I understand, it really is just engaging in discussions and um, that doesn't necessarily need to be sharing out with the bigger group,

527
01:09:23,830 --> 01:09:31,060
but just contributing to the things we talk about and the discussions that we have.

528
01:09:31,270 --> 01:09:34,599
Does that make sense? Mm. I see.

529
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:40,390
So you just know here there is no like sign in sheet that you just have like country.

530
01:09:40,660 --> 01:09:42,819
Oh you can just. Right. Right.

531
01:09:42,820 --> 01:09:51,370
I sort of I'm going to be working on learning some names and, and, you know, keeping track sort of, of who comes in, who's on, who's absent.

532
01:09:52,060 --> 01:09:55,750
Yeah. Um, okay. Yeah, um, yeah.

533
01:09:55,750 --> 01:09:58,840
That's how I kind of wanted to create.

534
01:09:58,870 --> 01:10:02,040
Great. I also have a question if it's not too personal.

535
01:10:02,050 --> 01:10:05,950
Um, I actually lived in an apartment building that over break.

536
01:10:05,950 --> 01:10:09,430
I'm wondering if we live in the same apartment building. What is the.

537
01:10:09,820 --> 01:10:13,750
I live in 114 north division 114.

538
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:21,520
No, I don't think so. Well we're living at 405 so it must have been a separate because my apartment,

539
01:10:21,700 --> 01:10:28,179
it wasn't my unit but unfortunately other units in my building got flooded as well over break.

540
01:10:28,180 --> 01:10:34,930
And I just my heart is breaking for those people because they, like you, are out of that apartment for a little bit.

541
01:10:34,930 --> 01:10:38,320
So it's extremely frustrating. Uh, sorry.

542
01:10:39,340 --> 01:10:47,229
Um, but I mean, I see that this is like, not just our problem is like happening across.

543
01:10:47,230 --> 01:10:59,110
Across. Yes, you know, whatever. And I don't know, like it's mostly it's just about room temperature and to like, okay, the pipe just broke.

544
01:10:59,230 --> 01:11:05,590
I see. No, it's like, oh, you maintain the room temperature to order 70 degrees.

545
01:11:05,590 --> 01:11:10,450
It won't be freezing cold first. I mean, I don't know.

546
01:11:10,690 --> 01:11:18,490
Like in our apartment, they say it's easy, preventable, but it seems like other apartments are having the same same issue.

547
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:23,380
Yeah, it was. It was an issue for the apartment building I live in as well.

548
01:11:23,530 --> 01:11:28,110
Yeah. Um, okay. Yeah, I think so.

549
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:32,529
Oh, of course. And certainly, you know, if you ever want to talk more, you know, I'm.

550
01:11:32,530 --> 01:11:35,979
I'm very open to setting up a meeting or even office hours. This is great.

551
01:11:35,980 --> 01:11:38,980
So. Yes, I appreciate that. Yeah, of course.

552
01:11:38,980 --> 01:11:46,130
Thank you for. Chatting for a little bit, you know. Do you have more classes today that you'll be going to?

553
01:11:46,340 --> 01:11:51,919
Yeah. I mean. I have one more class and.

554
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:58,190
Oh, my God. Okay. 1:00. Okay. I'm going home to pack up stuff to another hotel.

555
01:11:58,520 --> 01:12:01,910
I see. Oh, they are. They're paying for the hotel.

556
01:12:01,970 --> 01:12:05,870
Oh, good, good, good, good. Yeah.

557
01:12:05,870 --> 01:12:09,019
Please let me know if there's any way that I can, you know, accommodate.

558
01:12:09,020 --> 01:12:12,110
I know that that's got to be such a stressful time.

559
01:12:12,110 --> 01:12:18,060
So if there's anything I can do, please let me know. I think, you know, like, if I can talk to someone.

560
01:12:18,230 --> 01:12:21,770
Sure. Sure. Absolutely. Absolutely.

561
01:12:30,490 --> 01:13:02,890
Okay. Great. And can you remind me of your name one more time?

562
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:09,910
You can call me Jodi jokes. It's probably different from, like, what his name is.

563
01:13:10,780 --> 01:13:13,840
It's a Chinese name. I would tell you that. Okay.

564
01:13:15,070 --> 01:13:19,980
Like. I was just like, Why should I go?

565
01:13:20,230 --> 01:13:23,790
Oh, okay. Jolie okay. Yes.

566
01:13:23,790 --> 01:13:28,230
Very nice. Thank you for. Thank you for reminding me. And I hope you have a good rest of your day.

567
01:13:28,590 --> 01:13:29,700
You, too. Thank you.
