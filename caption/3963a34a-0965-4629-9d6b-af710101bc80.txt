1
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:41,030
Oh. What's.

2
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:22,840
And get help with that. Last.

3
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:38,720
And I asked. Three.

4
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:18,420
Yeah, I know. Oh, no.

5
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:37,400
She? Good morning.

6
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:42,640
Morning. How are you all doing? Welcome to Public Health 512.

7
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:48,560
How are you doing? Since the semester started doing good.

8
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:52,880
Nervous? It. It'll be okay.

9
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:57,590
Asset was not okay is what's showing up here?

10
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:02,750
I tried to call tech support and I didn't get anybody.

11
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:07,310
So I'm hoping that our next class next week, it will be better than this.

12
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:12,040
But I apologize that you have to go through the session this way.

13
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:19,490
I don't think I can pull it down. So my name is me as a son, and I am the instructor for this course.

14
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:23,610
I have been in a similar situation as you.

15
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:27,850
I did my master's trainee and also my trainee,

16
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:37,760
and also I had an opportunity to do post-doctoral training and intuition sciences department, so epilepsy and then nutritional sciences.

17
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:42,680
So I've been literally in the same spot you're in right now.

18
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:54,200
I took my introduction to epidemiology in this very same room, so it's a pleasure to be here and in welcoming you to this particular class.

19
00:03:56,510 --> 00:04:09,860
So if you want to contact me, you can contact me directly for personal matters using my e-mail address and mailbox then.

20
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:13,219
But if there's anything that's generally related to the class,

21
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:22,850
please use the course email address public health 512 residential as areas at you missed out edu.

22
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:29,540
It helps to streamline everything and we have a central place that we can go and pretty

23
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:34,370
much any team member can go to that account to look at any email you may have sent.

24
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:40,130
We do recognize that sometimes you might need to reach out to a specific GSI.

25
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:45,560
It might be the GSI who's leading your session, your discussion section of us.

26
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:53,630
You know, any other reason? Maybe you went to that person's office hours and then you had a follow up question or you wanted to clarify something.

27
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,280
You can email that person directly, but other than that, anything that is general,

28
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:03,680
please, please email the Public Health five to our residential account.

29
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,550
So I'm looking forward to a wonderful semester.

30
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:12,630
Getting to know you, getting to know your research interests,

31
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:19,620
getting to know what you would like to do after your training here is going to be going into the program.

32
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:26,880
I always put that out in air. All weather is going to be going out to work and do public health practice.

33
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:31,380
That's totally fine. Sometimes people go and practice and then come back to school.

34
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:38,940
That's fine as well. So I'm looking forward to knowing you are getting to know your interest as we progress during the semester.

35
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:45,380
I am excited to let you know. I'm joined by three wonderful guys.

36
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:54,680
Each one will be leading the discussion sessions and they will be your GSI for that section for the entire semester.

37
00:05:55,430 --> 00:06:02,870
So the first person is Christopher Crowe, of course, is a doctoral candidate in epidemiology department.

38
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:10,050
He's going to be the GSI for section two. The location is 1172.

39
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:17,720
If you're not too familiar with the rooms around here, I encourage you to stop by and check before your discussion section.

40
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:23,390
Or you can make sure you come early enough so you can find your room easily.

41
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:28,120
Again. The same thing applies to everybody in this audit.

42
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,430
They take the entire teaching team.

43
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:42,130
Please email us for general information using our public health residential email address or if it's specific, our personal email addresses.

44
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:51,950
We also have Analyst Lane and Elise is a MPH student and she's studying epidemiology.

45
00:06:52,400 --> 00:07:00,320
She is our guest for Section three. So please take note and the location for that section is g020.

46
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,720
This is not good. But we'll make it work.

47
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:13,540
And the location is in space. You. Finally we have Haley Blake in ways.

48
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:20,650
Haley is also a student in the Department of Epidemiology studying for her MPH.

49
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:27,760
Haley is a GSI for section four and the location for that is 1691 eight.

50
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:32,350
So this is your introduction to the teaching team.

51
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:39,500
You will get to know your GSI a little bit more when you meet your GSI on Thursday.

52
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,420
During discussion.

53
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:52,340
Our commitment to you for this class is that we will be flexible, we will be communicative, will be understanding, and will be available.

54
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:55,530
But we have other things on our schedule,

55
00:07:55,860 --> 00:08:04,470
so we encourage you to be proactive in reaching out to the teaching team and also in as much as we'll be flexible and understanding.

56
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:10,500
We are going to do so in a context of be fair to other students in a class, right?

57
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:14,850
We will adjust things based on maybe an emergency for you,

58
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:22,709
but there's a limit in terms of how we can adjust because other people may be meeting a deadline and they may be doing what's required.

59
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:27,510
So we will be flexible, but in the context of being fair to other people in the class.

60
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:37,770
So please take note. Be proactive in reaching out to us and we'll work with you for an arrangement that's going to be feasible and fair.

61
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:43,850
Any questions for logistics so far?

62
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:50,710
All right. So for the course description,

63
00:08:51,100 --> 00:09:01,300
this course is going to provide a foundation of regarding the key concepts of epidemiology for how we apply these concepts to public health.

64
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:07,930
And this is an introductory course for students who are not pursuing an MPH in epidemiology.

65
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:13,629
And so we have the honor of having undergrad students.

66
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:21,100
We have students who are not in the epidemiology department, and sometimes we have students in the class.

67
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:28,940
In some instances. We have students also at the School of Public Health who take the course as well.

68
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:34,670
And so we have this rich background of individuals in the class, and we can use that to our advantage.

69
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:45,500
The course will cover key concepts such as measure of measures of frequency and association.

70
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:54,650
We'll talk about the different study designs and the advantages and disadvantages associated with those study designs when you can use them.

71
00:09:55,010 --> 00:10:01,400
We'll talk about data collection practices, and key will be how we interpret the measures that we calculate.

72
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:06,020
So the measures of frequency that we calculate and the measures of association.

73
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:13,640
We'll spend some time trying to understand how to incorporate key aspects when we interpret.

74
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:23,420
And it's very important because if we are trying out a measure of association or a measure of disease frequency, we're putting it in context.

75
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:28,700
What's the time frame? Who's affected? Where's the location?

76
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:36,680
Then we tend to not quite get the full appreciation of that measure of frequency of disease, frequency that we've calculated.

77
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:44,920
For the bulk of what we do in this class, we will be working on canvas.

78
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:50,020
I'm hoping that all of you have had an opportunity to visit the canvas site.

79
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:55,330
We have almost all of our assignments that are due that will be due.

80
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,970
You also made those assignments on canvas.

81
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:08,830
You have the assumption being the two exams, those will be taken in person and there will be paper and pencil format.

82
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:13,689
But other than that, everything else will be taking on canvas.

83
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:16,810
So the quizzes, the English learner, you will be in discussion,

84
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:23,170
but at the end of that discussion section, you will upload the assignment if there's an assignment.

85
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:28,420
You upload that to canvas. The problem sets will also be uploaded to canvas.

86
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:38,680
So this just to orient you. Maybe you already have this information, but we want to make sure that you have the information you need.

87
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:45,550
If you click on this link, if you're looking at your computer, this gives you information and of course, syllabus.

88
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:50,230
This other link here gives you information on the instructor.

89
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:56,110
So our office hours and the links to our office hours, office hours would be all on zoom.

90
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:02,949
But if there's a day where somebody has a question or they're having difficulty

91
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:08,650
understanding the concept and they prefer that particular meeting to be in person,

92
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:14,320
let us know. We will work with you and work with our schedule to find time to meet with you in person.

93
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:17,950
Other than that, all of the office hours would be online,

94
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:26,709
and so we have the each week listed on the campus site to be able to get the top of the page.

95
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:33,670
I couldn't go beyond the first week, but this is what you will click on a given week for the materials for that class.

96
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:38,950
We have prerecorded videos and we have the slides which will be posted up before class.

97
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:45,900
Any questions regarding navigating canvas that you may have experienced in a past?

98
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:56,270
For the course textbook, we are going to be using Goddess Epidemiology, the sixth edition.

99
00:12:57,170 --> 00:13:02,569
You do not have to purchase the book. Totally up to you if you want to purchase this on.

100
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:07,760
People have a preference for, you know, having the physical copy but is not required.

101
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:12,800
You can access the book at the UVM library using this link.

102
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:20,540
Please let the teaching team know if you're having any problems accessing the book or if the link for some reason is not working.

103
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:30,090
If by chance you have a previous version, or if you decide to buy a previous version, that's totally fine.

104
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:35,610
You might find that some of the page numbering will be a little bit different.

105
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:41,430
Let the teaching team know if you want us to help you connect.

106
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:48,150
Maybe the sections or the patient numbers to the specific subsections that we've assigned for reading.

107
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:53,710
We're happy to assist with that. Course requirements.

108
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:57,490
This course is based on a total of 1000 points.

109
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:04,240
So you have to have quizzes that would be based most likely on a weekly basis.

110
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:12,430
I think maybe there are one or two weeks where we have no always you you have 12 quizzes, but only ten will count toward your final grade.

111
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,810
So it's 20 points per quiz for a total of 200 points.

112
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:25,590
And that accounts for 20% of your final grade. Problem sets, you have a total of 12 key difference to the problem sets.

113
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,000
All of them would be required.

114
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:40,720
And so you have 20 points for each problem set 240 points total and that counts toward 24% of your fine agree to exams 200 and 250 points each.

115
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:45,550
That would be error count toward 45% of your final grade.

116
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:51,400
And then finally, we have the English learning that will happen in discussion.

117
00:14:52,680 --> 00:15:00,600
This will be ten points for each submission. And this is really to get you engaged and participating in discussion.

118
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:12,190
For the English learning. Once you submit, you get the four points for that participation, and this counts toward 11% of your final grade.

119
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:17,990
Any questions about the assessments for the class?

120
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:28,250
Yes. For the quizzes.

121
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:33,559
So your two lowest grades would be dropped? Yeah. Now,

122
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:39,290
if for some reason you are not available and you didn't take one of the quizzes and

123
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:45,170
automatically got a zero in with that will be that will count as one of your Lewis quiz grades.

124
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:54,490
Now. As much as we will be flexible and working with people,

125
00:15:55,210 --> 00:16:04,360
the quizzes will be one of the areas where there's not too much opportunity to be flexible because the quizzes are due on Mondays at noon,

126
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:08,410
and then on Thursday, we'll have an opportunity to go over the quiz questions.

127
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:13,510
And so any requests for a miss quiz coming after that time frame?

128
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:18,950
It would be late because they would have already discussed the answers in discussion.

129
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:26,950
So keep that in mind when you know things come up and just let the teaching team know, we'll be happy to work with you,

130
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:32,500
but we just can't work out in opening the quiz for you to take after the window has closed.

131
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:39,510
So there are a number of competences that are satisfied.

132
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:44,700
By taking this course we are going to satisfy the FC one,

133
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:53,190
which has to do with applying epidemiological methods to a wide variety of settings and situations in public health.

134
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:58,910
We are going to also meet the requirements for quantitative data collection methods.

135
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:04,049
We will cover that in the class and then we will spend quite a bit of time calculating

136
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:08,550
and interpreting results from data analysis for public health research policy.

137
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:12,550
Our Practice. For office hours.

138
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:18,940
We were very intentional in trying to make sure we have coverage on all days of the week.

139
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:27,800
So on Tuesdays from 1 to 2 p.m., I will hold my office hours Mondays and Wednesdays from 5 to 6 p.m.

140
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:33,280
Christopher will hold his office hours, Mondays and Thursdays, 3 to 4.

141
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:37,270
Annalise And then Fridays from 930 to 1130.

142
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:42,310
Hayley will hold her office hours. So you see, we try to make sure that you're covered.

143
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,530
We know you have different schedules and.

144
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:54,720
Of course, we can cover every single hour that day, but we try to make it across the week so that you can find time that works for you.

145
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:59,560
You can attend any of the office hours that fit your schedule.

146
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:05,310
You don't have to go to analysts office hours because you're in a discussion section.

147
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:14,340
Anyone that works for your schedule, that should be fine. A reminder, all of these are on Zoom and then if you are not able to attend.

148
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:19,710
One. Maybe try to find another one later on in the week.

149
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:25,979
But if there's some emergency and you just can make any of the office hours for that week, please let us know.

150
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:32,670
And we might be able to schedule something to work for you now on a regular basis every week.

151
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:37,020
But if you have a pressing question and you want to meet, we can make time to do that.

152
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:42,190
Any questions about office hours or anything else we've covered so far?

153
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:49,210
Okay. So what's required for each weekly unit?

154
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:55,540
So we have one instructor led lecture, which is where we are now.

155
00:18:55,540 --> 00:19:00,830
So that's on Tuesday at 10 to 1131 G as I led discussion section.

156
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:05,170
That will be on Thursdays 10 to 1130 as well.

157
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:15,100
You have assigned readings and prerecorded lecture videos that we encourage you to watch before they choose this session.

158
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:23,130
You have a problem set. That's due on Mondays at noon and then a quiz that's also due on Mondays at noon.

159
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:27,880
I mentioned this, that there would be two exams in the course.

160
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:37,450
For the Choose the sessions. We are going to review highlights from what's covered in the lecture videos.

161
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:40,600
And then once we start working on the problem sets,

162
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:48,370
we will identify a few questions in a problem set that we'll cover in class to kind of get you started, we're working on your problem set.

163
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:56,030
It's very important because we're not going to go line by line about what's covered in the prerecorded lecture videos.

164
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:04,640
So is encouraged to that you wash the prerecorded videos before class on Tuesday.

165
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:11,650
We understand that sometimes schedules can vary and you may not be able to make it to class.

166
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:18,370
So each session will be recorded and once the video becomes available it will be posted on canvas.

167
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:24,940
Or even if you are in class that you want to go back to review, the video is going to also be there and available to you.

168
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:37,240
For discussion sections on Thursday, you will have an opportunity to review quizzes, understand why this answer is correct or was incorrect.

169
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:43,510
You will complete English learning assignments. You will review key concepts.

170
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:48,190
And then if there are errors or confusion, we will make time to cover that.

171
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:51,770
You will have an opportunity to engage with your classmates.

172
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:55,930
The setting is a little bit too large, so no opportunity to really connect with your classmates.

173
00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:07,899
And then you might have an exercise that will be a group based exercise that you will work with your group members, and then later on in the semester,

174
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:13,780
you will have an opportunity to identify an article that you are interested in and

175
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:18,730
to then link that article to key concepts that will be covered in the course.

176
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:29,560
And so you will be able to critique the article about what you are learning in the class and to identify those key concepts apply to that.

177
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:34,930
Monastery. My article that you may have identified.

178
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:42,010
Please note when you registered, we had five sections for publication 512.

179
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:47,740
So this session that we are having now is section one. And then we have four discussion sections.

180
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:54,190
We have condensed the discussion sections. Now, instead of for discussion sections, we have three.

181
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:59,800
So please double check our main access to see which discussion section you are in.

182
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:04,510
So you are able to go to the correct location on Thursday.

183
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:11,980
If you are previously registered for Section five, you will find that that section is not available anymore.

184
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:20,020
So please take note. If is not clear, please reach out to the teaching team and we'll be happy to let you know which section you.

185
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:29,080
Any question about this. And then I think almost.

186
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:33,190
The final thing related to our logistics.

187
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:40,620
We have a weekly Amadeus Point survey. This will be an opportunity to let the teaching team know.

188
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:44,190
Maybe what we covered in class wasn't quite clear.

189
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:47,970
Or maybe you want the teaching team to provide an example for what was cover.

190
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:56,460
This is your opportunity and this is the link. The link is also going to be on canvas and you're going to be able to access it after class.

191
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,030
Visit the link and let us know anything that's not clear.

192
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:06,900
And we'll be happy to somehow incorporated in a way that you are able to get this information.

193
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:12,690
It will be a reply to you by email, or if it's something as extensive,

194
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:17,180
I might add it to slides for the following week or it might be covered in discussion.

195
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:24,630
So multiple opportunities to. Get feedback from us based on things that were not clear.

196
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:28,350
So this is what the form looks like. It has two components.

197
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:36,810
One, it's asking for your name and your last name is optional, is now required for you to provide this information.

198
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:46,330
The benefit of adding your name is that if we have something now, we need to clarify what the question you are asking.

199
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:50,680
We can then reach out to you and ask you the question you are asking.

200
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:57,220
Was it quite clear? Please clarify or we can communicate that way, but it's not required.

201
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:06,669
We will do our best if you do not leave your need to answer the question as best as possible in a format,

202
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:13,570
either in the lecture section or in discussion. So it's totally up to you if you leave your name or not.

203
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:23,560
But the key thing that we want to hear is what concept from the giving or giving week was still not clear to you any questions about what is a survey?

204
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:30,109
Okay. For collaboration.

205
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:33,230
We encourage you to collaborate on quizzes.

206
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:33,920
Yes.

207
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:44,630
And when we say collaborate on quizzes, the goal is really enough for you to ask your peer, you know, you've completed the quiz, what's the answer?

208
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:49,970
What is more to discuss? Most of the questions have multiple choice answers,

209
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:56,420
and maybe a way to enhance your learning experience would be to kind of go through those questions

210
00:24:56,420 --> 00:25:01,460
and see why this is not the correct answer and why both of you think this is the correct answer.

211
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:09,500
And that would be an opportunity to. Further digest the information presented in class.

212
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:18,230
So we encourage you to collaborate on quizzes, collaborate on problem set study, and then the English learning that we're happy in this question.

213
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:32,380
Clear point that we were making no collaboration on exams and what would definitely be penalized is if you directly copy another person's work.

214
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:40,149
The gases in our graders are usually able to identify when people have the same answer.

215
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:44,350
So be careful. Discuss. Please don't tell us.

216
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:48,010
We did the homework together so we have the exact same words is not possible.

217
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:54,010
You can discuss the homework together, but if you go to write the homework on your own, you will have different words.

218
00:25:54,340 --> 00:26:01,030
So discuss it. But please use your own words for what you submit to the school canvas.

219
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:06,090
Any questions about collaboration? Yes.

220
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:16,460
In general? No. But then. Yes. So you are not time.

221
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:21,920
So when the quiz opens. You have until 12 noon.

222
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:25,530
When is due the following week. So the entire time is open.

223
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:33,569
It is not time, but is time in a sense, because when it's due then you know you can continue working on the quiz.

224
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:41,550
So in general is not time, but I don't want to just say is not time and then people might forget and just start the quiz and that's completed.

225
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:47,010
So you are not limited to 30 minutes or you can I've seen people take the quiz for days.

226
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:50,370
You know, it's open and they're coming back to it at different time.

227
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:55,600
You, of course, you can use your notes to. And so the questions.

228
00:26:56,380 --> 00:27:02,650
But just keep in mind that you have to get back to the quiz before 12 noon the following Monday.

229
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:14,140
Is that clear? Okay? Yes. You know, so great question.

230
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:20,290
So it's going to be stuff that we've already covered. Any other question?

231
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:30,000
So I think I've said this enough. Remember to email us using the course email.

232
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:35,580
And then for canvas, make sure you have your canvass announcement.

233
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:41,960
Activated so you'll be able to receive notifications from us.

234
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:50,990
So far I haven't sent any announcements. So you haven't missed anything. I've used Wolverine access to email you, but just make sure you have that.

235
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:55,160
So if we send any announcement by canvas, you will be able to get that.

236
00:27:57,290 --> 00:28:07,120
So we've covered logistics. Are there any questions, anything that I didn't cover or if I covered something that wasn't clear?

237
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:10,970
Do you have any questions? Yes.

238
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:16,540
Is the final ten or is it? Another good question.

239
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:24,790
It's not cumulative, but there are certain concepts that we'll cover in the first that you need

240
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:29,230
to be able to understand to answer questions in the second part of the exam.

241
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:38,110
But there's no specific question that will be coming from the first part of the class that would be put on the second exam.

242
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:47,780
Key thing. Certain concepts we apply. So for the first part of the class, we will cover calculating measures of disease frequency.

243
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:54,590
And then for the second part of the class, we will cover calculating measures of association.

244
00:28:55,130 --> 00:29:02,750
So you have to have a full understanding of calculating disease frequency to be able to apply that to measures of association.

245
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:07,320
So no, but. Don't drop your guard.

246
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:13,230
Okay. Any other questions? All right.

247
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:18,060
So our plan for today, we'll have a gentle introduction.

248
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:21,900
What we're doing, an overview of causal inference,

249
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:32,550
a key component of what we're doing in epidemiology is to be able to understand the relationship between an exposure and an outcome.

250
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:41,940
And so a fundamental question that we do is we do consider and we do evaluating epidemiology is.

251
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:50,070
Is the exposure related to the outcome. And so this is what we're going to talk about today.

252
00:29:50,340 --> 00:30:02,520
Causal inference, how we the steps that we need to be able to go through to be able to understand how confident we are, what are our study,

253
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:07,710
our findings or the relationship with evaluated, what that relationship is,

254
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:12,480
one that could be considered a causal or if we have other explanations for that.

255
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:21,879
Okay. So when we think about the many different exposures that we are interested in my research,

256
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:27,850
I'm interested in environmental exposures and how they relate to maternal and child health outcomes.

257
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:35,830
So some of the work I've done, I've looked at air pollution exposure and how that relates to preterm birth

258
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:41,709
outcomes or how air pollution exposure relates to maternal health outcomes,

259
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:48,670
specifically blood pressure during pregnancy. And so in that process, I want to understand being exposed to air pollution,

260
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:57,670
specifically higher levels of air pollution compared to other areas, whether that exposure is associated with, for example, preterm birth.

261
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:07,800
Even though we start our research question on trying to say is that exposure associated?

262
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:15,540
The key and fundamental question is really, is that exposure a causal agent for the outcome?

263
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:20,940
Is that exposure causally related to the outcome?

264
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:23,580
And that's a certain bar asset.

265
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:34,740
What we want to establish causality in any individual study, we can look at associations, but for causality it requires more than one study.

266
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:44,200
Okay. So. Most studies, individual studies will look at is the exposure associated with outcome.

267
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:48,490
And later on in the semester we have different study designs that will help us

268
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:53,740
understand whether an exposure is associated with outcome or giving outcome.

269
00:31:54,280 --> 00:32:00,489
We have different study designs that will give us a little more confidence about our findings and

270
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:06,160
then some study designs that will allow us to maybe generate hypotheses for for future studies.

271
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:14,399
But we have gotten to a point where we've collected enough data to foster the exposure outcome

272
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:20,520
relationships that we are able to now say that exposure is causally related to the outcome.

273
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:30,440
Do we know of any exposure outcome relationship at this point that you can talk about that is closely related to the outcome?

274
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:42,500
Any guess? If you are intending to raise your hair as slow, like a little bit of a hesitation.

275
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:55,130
As Zach Lee. We've got enough information at this point to be able to establish that smoking is closely related to lung cancer.

276
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,400
But this is not based on one study.

277
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:06,440
One study can indicate that there is a relationship and then it can set the pace for other studies to be conducted.

278
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:16,040
But this is based on the accumulation of evidence to be able to get to that point, to comfortably say smoking causes lung cancer.

279
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:23,660
And then we are now at a phase where we are doing a policy based on the research conduct from that process.

280
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:38,350
There are many different possible ways that possible relationships you can get from an exposure outcome relationship.

281
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:43,810
One would be where you have limited evidence of a relationship.

282
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:48,819
And so if you have a lot of studies that have been conducted and you are not seeing

283
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:52,840
a strong association or even an association between that exposure and the outcome,

284
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:57,970
then it's usually getting to that point, which is going to be a worthy of study.

285
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:02,060
At least in that form, because sometimes people can read,

286
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:10,620
they find the research question or they can focus on slightly different components and be able to kind of start that investigation again.

287
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:15,570
Then there some sometimes where you have good evidence of a relationship.

288
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:18,480
And many more evidence will be required.

289
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:27,210
So, you know, most studies will be funded and most studies will be conducted on that particular relationship where you have good evidence.

290
00:34:27,810 --> 00:34:35,580
And then once you get to the point where you have strong evidence of a relationship such that you've done the individual level studies,

291
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:44,400
you've done meta analysis, which is where you're combining multiple research studies and you still see a strong relationship.

292
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:50,880
Then you get into the point where you can get comfortable and start considering that this is a causal relationship.

293
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:56,070
Most times when you get to this point, then you start thinking about public policy,

294
00:34:56,340 --> 00:35:01,380
how the findings are going to be used to reduce the burden of disease in the community.

295
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:08,000
So some examples would be like somebody's answer earlier.

296
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:16,580
Lung cancer and smoking are an example for good evidence will be bedtime for high school students and academic performance.

297
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:28,610
And then one that's worthy of study, at least currently in this form would be hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin working to treat COVID 19.

298
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:35,130
I want you to understand for the limited evidence of our relationship.

299
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:38,910
This is not to say that this is never going to come up in a study again.

300
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:45,299
The research investigator could go through the assistant literature and find something

301
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:50,370
that maybe wasn't clear or something in the way the study was conducted and then say,

302
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:56,970
We want to see if we removed this flaw from the previous studies, if we're going to find a relationship.

303
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:00,540
So it is not that is never going to be a study,

304
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:09,120
but it might need some consideration to change how the previous studies were conducted to be able to kind of.

305
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:14,560
Get it to the point where you can say, we need to explore this as a new topic.

306
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:20,350
Any questions so far? Okay.

307
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:29,500
And so when we conduct studies, we usually come up with results and we have findings.

308
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:36,680
But we need to be careful that you will have multiple explanations for your findings.

309
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:41,560
One could be an ideally, which is what we are hoping for,

310
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:50,379
that the exposure outcome relationship that we investigated in our study that that relationship and the

311
00:36:50,380 --> 00:37:00,040
results we have is truly a causal relationship and in that the exposure really has an impact on the outcome.

312
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:08,760
Other times you might have a situation where you have reverse causation wherein the disease is causing the exposure.

313
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:13,889
And you might be wondering how is this possible? Say, for example,

314
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:27,180
you are interested in understanding the relationship between being overweight and having maybe mobility issues or knee or osteoarthritis.

315
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:31,820
If you conduct a cross-sectional study.

316
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:35,820
We'll talk about that a little bit later. But this is an example.

317
00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:41,460
You're going to be collecting information on the exposure and the outcome at the same time.

318
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:45,630
And when you do that, you're going to be assigning one of those.

319
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:51,670
Components to be your exposure and one would be your outcome.

320
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:57,360
Now, which one do you select as your exposure and which one do you select as your outcome?

321
00:37:57,450 --> 00:38:01,800
Is it decreased mobility or is it being overweight?

322
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:09,030
And so what? We collect data at the same point in time, then we have no idea which one came first.

323
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:17,400
We have some study designs that will allow us to be able to understand all this better, understand the relationship between those two factors.

324
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:24,330
And so if you choose the wrong factor as your exposure,

325
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:28,590
then you have a situation where you have reverse causation because you are now

326
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:35,130
say that the disease is you're saying that the exposure is causing the disease,

327
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:39,570
but based on the way you collect, all your data is going to actually be the other way around.

328
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:47,930
And so we need to be careful how we assign exposure outcome status to the variables we collect in our studies.

329
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:52,419
Based on the study design, we are able to get away from this.

330
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:56,830
If we use our longitudinal study designs, we'll cover that a little bit later.

331
00:38:58,690 --> 00:39:04,660
Other times you might have a situation where your association found in your study could be due to chance.

332
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:09,880
Right. So there's actually no association between your exposure and your outcome.

333
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:14,290
But in your study, by chance, you found an association.

334
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:22,270
And so we need to be careful. And this is why we need multiple studies over time in different populations to

335
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:27,370
be able to understand whether an exposure is closely related to an outcome.

336
00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:31,540
And then the final way would be bias.

337
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:39,930
Bias will be maybe errors that we managed to get into our study based on the way we conducted

338
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:45,330
our study into the way we collected data or the way we asked participants questions.

339
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:54,030
This can lead to us getting the wrong answers from participants, and then we have the wrong findings for our study.

340
00:39:54,420 --> 00:40:00,870
So these are multiple potential explanations for when we conduct our study.

341
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:05,520
That could potentially be the reason for the findings that we have.

342
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:09,640
We will spend some time going over bias.

343
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:17,040
There's a whole section in the class where we talk about bias and how the mistakes that we make in data collection,

344
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:22,010
how that can influence our study results. Any questions about?

345
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:30,330
The explanations that we could come up with for finding an association studies.

346
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:37,200
Okay. And so.

347
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:44,180
We need to find a way to help us, at least to guide us when we think about causation.

348
00:40:44,930 --> 00:40:48,800
There's the modified determinism, which was developed by Ken Rothman,

349
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:56,900
and this model explores different components that are used to explain the development of disease.

350
00:40:57,410 --> 00:41:01,040
You have component necessary and sufficient causes.

351
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:11,060
In India go is how you can use that as a complete causal mechanism to explain how they work together to produce disease.

352
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:24,430
So the key concept here is that we have these different components and how combining them will lead to the development of of disease.

353
00:41:25,330 --> 00:41:30,700
What this is actually saying is that you have multiple pathways to development of disease.

354
00:41:31,330 --> 00:41:37,810
So it's now one pathway somebody has diabetes is not one pathway to develop of of diabetes.

355
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:43,480
Or if a person has an infectious disease is not one pathway to that infectious disease.

356
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:49,060
It's a little bit different from from chronic versus infectious diseases.

357
00:41:49,450 --> 00:41:55,680
And we'll do to. Example. So you you can process the concept a little bit more.

358
00:41:57,390 --> 00:42:04,170
So, for example, there are multiple pathways that lead to the development of disease among some individuals.

359
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:08,220
So let's take an example, a chronic disease such as cancer.

360
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:14,669
There are multiple pathways to developing cancer as as much as we see all the time.

361
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:20,520
That cigaret smoke is strongly associated with developing lung cancer.

362
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:25,980
It's not the only pathway. There are other pathways for which people can develop lung cancer.

363
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:33,810
So for example, one pathway could be exposure to cigaret smoke and susceptibility to lung cancer.

364
00:42:34,350 --> 00:42:37,870
And the reason why is importance in susceptibility to lung cancer.

365
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:42,030
Some people smoke their entire lives and they don't develop lung cancer.

366
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:51,060
Right. So the second pathway could be exposure to radon, which is a naturally occurring radioactive gas.

367
00:42:51,790 --> 00:42:58,270
Other pathway could be genetic mutations that increase the risk of lung cancer among certain individuals.

368
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:02,139
So the outcome that we see is lung cancer.

369
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:09,790
But people get a lung cancer from different pathways. Because we're still learning when we do research.

370
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:15,550
We do not fool ourselves to say we know all the pathways leading to lung cancer.

371
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:24,250
But this is just to give you a sense of the concept that you have multiple pathways to the development of a given disease.

372
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:37,430
How about infectious disease outcomes? You have a similar situation, but in this case, the infectious agent is always in the path on the pathway,

373
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:43,040
but other components are maybe different and the other companies involved.

374
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:55,180
So for an infectious disease conceptual model would be have one where a person is exposed to a large dose of the infectious agent.

375
00:43:55,330 --> 00:43:59,320
It could be influenza. It could be. It could be RSV.

376
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:08,330
Or it could be any other agent. The second pathway could be exposure's exposure to the infectious agent and the person

377
00:44:08,330 --> 00:44:12,560
who has been exposed has no history of immunization against that infectious agent.

378
00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:17,720
There's a chance that that person will develop the disease after being exposed.

379
00:44:19,210 --> 00:44:27,320
Then another pathway could be exposure to the infectious agent, but the person knows they have a healthy dietary intake and all,

380
00:44:27,370 --> 00:44:32,860
and that will maybe work on making the person a little more susceptible after they've been exposed.

381
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:40,270
So for the infectious model, you still have the infectious agent happening in all three of the pathways,

382
00:44:40,570 --> 00:44:46,300
but there are other factors that contribute to the actual development of the disease in the person.

383
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:53,610
Any question about these concepts. Okay.

384
00:44:55,750 --> 00:45:00,250
And so taking that conceptual model from there,

385
00:45:02,110 --> 00:45:13,990
Rothman proposed having these causal pies that represent the component that work together should lead to the development of disease in individuals.

386
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:20,380
So let's see, this pie is one pathway represents one pathway.

387
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:29,350
A has four different components that come together that lead to the eventual development of a given disease in an individual.

388
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:43,350
This second, PI has five components that work together that lead to the development of that same disease in some individuals in the population.

389
00:45:44,470 --> 00:45:50,260
Then this pie would g. It has just one factor in this pie is.

390
00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:58,410
Sufficient enough to lead to the development of that same disease in some other individuals in the population.

391
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:03,270
And then finally, you have this other pie with three components,

392
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:10,470
and those components work together to develop that same disease in some other individuals in the population.

393
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:16,770
It's a little bit abstract. I have some examples that we can go over to kind of make it register more.

394
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:25,010
But key concepts associated with the costs apply include unnecessary costs, the first one,

395
00:46:25,490 --> 00:46:33,230
and for it to be unnecessary costs, that costs or that component has to be found in all cases of disease.

396
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:39,420
And then you have component courses where is needed in some cases of the disease.

397
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:49,120
It doesn't occur. In every case of the disease, it is sufficient cause is that set this one by the set of necessary and component

398
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:54,220
causes that work together that lead to the development of disease in individuals.

399
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:59,880
Any questions about the terms associated with causal bias?

400
00:47:03,610 --> 00:47:07,110
Okay. And so.

401
00:47:09,330 --> 00:47:16,020
Necessary clause for this particular example here, we don't have unnecessary costs.

402
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:20,040
Somebody tell me why we have no unnecessary costs for all of these costs.

403
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Yes. There isn't the same water and. Correct.

404
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:34,630
Thank you. And so we have components here and we have sufficient causes, meaning these components are working together to produce disease.

405
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:40,150
But you don't have any single component that's occurring in all of the PI's.

406
00:47:40,510 --> 00:47:46,210
Great. Then for component classes we have.

407
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:50,870
This that. All of the components in the pie.

408
00:47:51,470 --> 00:47:57,170
So, I mean, if it's occurring more than once, so we just this is is that same one.

409
00:47:57,560 --> 00:48:08,840
And so a component year would be all of the parts that work together to be to cause disease in individuals, in the population.

410
00:48:09,230 --> 00:48:18,460
And so each factor is a component. And so component causes associate that with this disease is going to be a list of all of the components here.

411
00:48:19,390 --> 00:48:23,480
Any question, component costs. Yes.

412
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:41,280
So this not at least one component here that's occurring and all of these pies.

413
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:51,680
So if we had a in this pie and then a also in this pie, there would be unnecessary cost, meaning at least it occurs in all of the pies.

414
00:48:53,210 --> 00:49:00,960
And then keep in mind that unnecessary costs can also be accompanied because think about a component is part of a whole.

415
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:14,000
Right. And so if if a is unnecessary cost is still a part of the factors leading to disease in individuals, in a community or in the population.

416
00:49:14,210 --> 00:49:22,190
And so you have a situation where unnecessary cost is also a component cost, but is not necessarily the other way around.

417
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:26,090
That component cost is unnecessary costs.

418
00:49:28,650 --> 00:49:34,820
And then finally, we have sufficient causes and year for sufficient causes.

419
00:49:34,830 --> 00:49:38,840
We have these pies. So pie A, B, C and D.

420
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:41,070
This first pie is one sufficient cause,

421
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:49,470
which will be the set of necessary and contributing causes that make disease inevitable among some individuals in the population.

422
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:58,890
So this one b, c, d, e, f is a separate sufficient cause a b, c, a separate sufficient cause.

423
00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:01,860
And then g is a separate sufficient cause,

424
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:10,950
meaning each pie is capable of working together to produce produced a disease under study in the population.

425
00:50:11,970 --> 00:50:16,290
So a little bit abstract. Let's take a look at some examples.

426
00:50:17,610 --> 00:50:23,040
So we're going to look at COVID 19 and imagine for a moment.

427
00:50:23,550 --> 00:50:28,890
Bear with me and play along that we have conducted.

428
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:37,870
Top research at the School of Public Health here. And we've identified three pathways to developing COVID 19.

429
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:50,620
Imagine. But don't quote me after class that we have a sufficient cause that leads to the development of COVID 19 disease in individuals.

430
00:50:50,670 --> 00:50:58,500
So the first one would be that that person is exposed to COVID 19 virus.

431
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:08,260
So the SARS-CoV-2, that person did not get the COVID 19 vaccine and the person did not wear the mask when they went to.

432
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:18,060
Maybe you'll get a ring. So those components will work together to lead to the development of disease among some individuals in the population.

433
00:51:18,510 --> 00:51:25,420
And the reason why I'm particular, by saying some individuals in the population, some people may not take the COVID vaccine.

434
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:29,639
They might be in a room exposed to somebody even talking closely next to somebody

435
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:34,110
who has COVID 19 and not wearing a mask and still won't develop COVID 19.

436
00:51:34,350 --> 00:51:38,910
So we know this is a pathway that would lead to disease among some individuals.

437
00:51:39,330 --> 00:51:45,660
But some people might have a genetic disposition to have some features protective against COVID 19.

438
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:52,920
And we may not know, but we know that a pathway may not necessarily lead to disease in all individuals.

439
00:51:54,650 --> 00:52:04,370
The second sufficient cause that we've identified is COVID 19 exposure person who also has HIV infection.

440
00:52:04,970 --> 00:52:09,620
And then the person was sitting adjacent to a COVID 19 case for 2 hours.

441
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:13,260
They were at a gallery, they were chatting. They were sitting next to that person.

442
00:52:14,090 --> 00:52:21,500
So that's one pathway to get COVID 19. And then it's a sufficient cause that we've identified.

443
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:24,950
We have Sars-cov two exposure.

444
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:29,150
The person works at a job that requires in-person attendance.

445
00:52:29,630 --> 00:52:32,690
And then the person did not wear a mask. And so.

446
00:52:34,570 --> 00:52:40,330
Imagine that these are the three pathways that can lead you to develop COVID 19.

447
00:52:41,050 --> 00:52:48,100
And so we have sufficient courses. And then we have components and then we have necessary courses.

448
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:53,800
We see that SA SARS-CoV-2 exposure occurs in all of the PIs.

449
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:58,990
So many is as a necessary clause for infectious agents.

450
00:52:59,170 --> 00:53:05,620
You will see that the infectious agent or the causative agent is going to always appear in the PIs.

451
00:53:06,070 --> 00:53:09,280
But for chronic disease, which I show, for example, for lung cancer,

452
00:53:09,550 --> 00:53:17,620
you might have multiple factors and it's possible you will not have one factor occurring in all of the PIs.

453
00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:26,950
So from that example, we can say that the necessary costs a SARS-CoV-2 exposure that's our infectious

454
00:53:26,950 --> 00:53:33,790
agent four component causes may remember is found in some people with the disease.

455
00:53:34,330 --> 00:53:41,170
So some people who did not take the COVID vaccine and then the person did not wear the mask that was.

456
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:49,549
Forward the sufficient pie one. The second one here component cost is coming from sufficient pie.

457
00:53:49,550 --> 00:53:57,170
Two would be HIV infection sitting next to a person who has COVID for 2 hours.

458
00:53:57,740 --> 00:54:01,820
And then the third one would be a job that requires in-person attendance.

459
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:06,280
And the worker is not wearing a mask at work. Now.

460
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:18,010
Carry along with this example in the definition, that necessary clause is one that is found in all people with the disease.

461
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:24,620
Which factory here and how can we make one of these factories to be unnecessary costs?

462
00:54:25,850 --> 00:54:30,800
How can we move one of these factors from component costs to be.

463
00:54:32,330 --> 00:54:39,450
Unnecessary cost. Yes. Yeah.

464
00:54:42,470 --> 00:54:51,320
Totally correct. So and this is just an example to help you process how something could be considered unnecessary costs.

465
00:54:51,650 --> 00:54:53,810
But that's exactly what I was getting at.

466
00:54:54,110 --> 00:55:04,490
If for some reason we had in this pie in the middle, we had mask not worn, then that would automatically elevate that to unnecessary costs.

467
00:55:04,670 --> 00:55:10,069
Right. So this is just an example you might not want is not necessarily going to be unnecessary costs.

468
00:55:10,070 --> 00:55:15,410
But if you have an example where you have all the sufficient causes for giving disease.

469
00:55:16,530 --> 00:55:29,370
Yes. Sorry I didn't get so in the.

470
00:55:41,070 --> 00:55:48,389
Exactly giving what we know about COVID and if the question is assume these are the sufficient causes.

471
00:55:48,390 --> 00:55:53,879
So this is an example to help us process it, but we know is a little bit more than these three causes.

472
00:55:53,880 --> 00:56:02,520
But if you have an example where we're saying these are the sufficient causes and you see something appearing in all of the pies,

473
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:05,590
that gives you an indication that it's unnecessary costs. Okay.

474
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:11,600
So my and I won't if it was in the pie in the middle, that would be considered a necessary cost.

475
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:20,460
And then the COVID vaccine, if it was if we had it in all three of these components, it would be elevated to unnecessary cost.

476
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:27,600
Great question. And so all of these working together now, we have the sufficient costs of it.

477
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:39,310
Exposure. No COVID 19 vaccine must now warn it in similar situation for all of the factors appearing in sufficient cost to it in sufficient cost.

478
00:56:39,310 --> 00:56:44,650
Three. Any question about these. Components.

479
00:56:45,170 --> 00:56:48,520
Just to make sure that in the. Running on a tie.

480
00:56:49,570 --> 00:56:57,330
Oh, don't go. Any question.

481
00:56:59,110 --> 00:57:09,460
Okay. If it comes to you afterward, please complete the Warriors Point Survey or reach out to the public, have a 512 email address.

482
00:57:10,330 --> 00:57:16,450
So we have another example. This time around, we're looking at tuberculosis.

483
00:57:17,110 --> 00:57:25,600
Tuberculosis is another infectious disease that's caused by a bacterium call mark or a bacteria.

484
00:57:28,610 --> 00:57:33,410
Usually individuals are exposed to the TB bacteria.

485
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:42,610
And then for some people it stays in the body for a long period of time and then due to certain circumstances,

486
00:57:42,610 --> 00:57:48,910
it might become active is one of those infectious diseases that can be latent.

487
00:57:49,450 --> 00:57:55,100
And then if you have the right conditions, it can develop into active TB.

488
00:57:55,270 --> 00:57:59,950
So if you look at the literature, you see active TB and you see latent TB.

489
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:07,510
So in this case, we have three sufficient causes. One, the person is exposed to TB bacteria.

490
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:11,290
The person has HIV AIDS and they have poor nutrition.

491
00:58:12,250 --> 00:58:20,410
The second costs here, sufficient costs. The first thing is living in an environment where they have poor ventilation.

492
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:26,650
They have crowd crowding, meaning what they are is is just crowd to a lot of people.

493
00:58:27,250 --> 00:58:34,150
Absence of BCG. The BCG is the vaccine used to prevent TB disease.

494
00:58:34,510 --> 00:58:41,740
So is the bacillus comet. Growing vaccine was most times referred to as the BCG vaccine.

495
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:46,300
So this person dating or some people in the population did not take the BCG vaccine

496
00:58:46,570 --> 00:58:51,160
and then they were exposed to TB bacteria and then it turned sufficient cause.

497
00:58:51,160 --> 00:59:01,930
Here we have poor nutrition, crowding, exposure to TB bacteria, no TB vaccine and then poor ventilation.

498
00:59:02,290 --> 00:59:09,490
So we have these three sufficient causes that will detail the development of active TB in the population.

499
00:59:11,210 --> 00:59:16,310
So based on this wish cause this would be considered necessary in this case.

500
00:59:16,730 --> 00:59:20,370
Yes. Awesome.

501
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:25,620
Thank you. That's correct. And now which courses are going to be considered component courses?

502
00:59:32,190 --> 00:59:37,650
Yes. There you go. All of them in one way or.

503
00:59:38,990 --> 00:59:43,660
Cause. Okay.

504
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:47,250
So each item, right? Yes. Okay. I wasn't sure what it was.

505
00:59:47,260 --> 00:59:50,440
All of them like in pie form or individual?

506
00:59:50,780 --> 00:59:58,420
Yes. It's like. Awesome.

507
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:02,339
Thank you. So, I'm sorry. You just made it. Yes.

508
01:00:02,340 --> 01:00:07,590
There you go. So similar would be A to G. So each factor year would be considered a component.

509
01:00:07,590 --> 01:00:11,490
Costs, including exposure to TB is also a component.

510
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:15,040
And then which causes sufficient. Yes.

511
01:00:20,590 --> 01:00:37,090
I'm sorry. It's the last. No, it's sufficient.

512
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:43,400
It just had additional components there. It's almost similar to what we did, what we said, mask not.

513
01:00:44,090 --> 01:00:50,390
So you can find some components happening in other ones, but it may not be all of the same components.

514
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:57,340
So it's still a sufficient class. So in this case, the causes that are sufficient would be each pie.

515
01:00:57,370 --> 01:01:02,790
Each pie would be enough to produce disease.

516
01:01:03,140 --> 01:01:09,660
If some people in the population. Any questions before we do a quick knowledge check?

517
01:01:09,830 --> 01:01:15,080
Yeah. What would make it not sufficient?

518
01:01:15,110 --> 01:01:23,360
That's a great question. If we remove exposure to TB bacteria, you can develop TB without being exposed to TB bacteria.

519
01:01:27,470 --> 01:01:31,100
Yes. Because there's no way you can develop it with all that.

520
01:01:31,670 --> 01:01:43,040
That's a great question. This is easier to demonstrate in an infectious disease context compared to a chronic disease context.

521
01:01:43,340 --> 01:01:50,660
Right. Because for TB, we know the etiologic agent or the causative agent for chronic disease.

522
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:55,260
We don't know all of the factors that lead to the development of even lung cancer.

523
01:01:55,280 --> 01:02:02,000
We know smoking is one that's very common, but we know people can develop smoking.

524
01:02:02,210 --> 01:02:06,380
I'm sorry. Lung cancer, we're all having a pathway through smoking.

525
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:15,320
And so it's easier to demonstrate this in an infectious disease context compared to a chronic disease model.

526
01:02:15,620 --> 01:02:24,620
Looking at lung cancer, diabetes, hypertension, it gets a little bit complicated if you take it to a chronic disease context.

527
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:31,830
So we're going to do some knowledge check regarding the cost of PIs.

528
01:02:32,580 --> 01:02:40,380
So given this set of PIs, imagine that the letters represent a description or something for the development of a given disease.

529
01:02:40,890 --> 01:02:44,340
What are the necessary recourses for within these PIs?

530
01:02:45,770 --> 01:02:50,290
Yes. Correct. So B and C, we see.

531
01:02:50,290 --> 01:02:54,610
Thank you. B and C are in each of the pies here.

532
01:02:54,820 --> 01:02:57,820
B and c. B and c. B. And C.

533
01:02:58,180 --> 01:03:01,690
And so these are the factors that are necessary for the development of disease.

534
01:03:02,020 --> 01:03:06,610
Simply because we see that they're occurring all of the parts represented here.

535
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:20,010
What are the component causes for the set of pies presented? Yes.

536
01:03:20,970 --> 01:03:25,440
And you go. So all of these are components.

537
01:03:27,060 --> 01:03:32,700
That lead to the development of this disease that we are going and talking about.

538
01:03:32,700 --> 01:03:39,390
But we have identified in diseases more, trying to understand the concept and then giving this set of PI's.

539
01:03:39,810 --> 01:03:43,830
What are all what is the sufficient cause or causes?

540
01:03:46,770 --> 01:03:50,660
Yes, Jimmy. On its own. The combination of.

541
01:03:52,410 --> 01:03:57,140
Awesome. Yes. Both pies. Well, both pies as in each pie.

542
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:06,670
Now you. I have both pies, but I just want to clarify that is each pie is a sufficient cause of the disease in the population.

543
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:23,000
Yes. Correct. Thank you. Yes. Doesn't matter if you ask for the component, as long as you list all of them, the order is not necessary.

544
01:04:23,330 --> 01:04:28,650
Yeah. And then the final knowledge check.

545
01:04:29,070 --> 01:04:32,160
Are there any courses that are necessary? Insufficient?

546
01:04:32,820 --> 01:04:36,930
Yes. All right. Thank you.

547
01:04:37,110 --> 01:04:48,329
That's correct. So we have B that's occurring in all of the pies so we know is necessary costs, but we see B also here.

548
01:04:48,330 --> 01:04:52,050
It's a sufficient cost all by itself. Yes. On the question of.

549
01:04:52,890 --> 01:04:56,800
Yes. In this case since alone.

550
01:04:57,430 --> 01:05:06,100
It wasn't. No, it's not necessary cause because it's not in the autopilot.

551
01:05:06,290 --> 01:05:13,420
Remember, for it to be unnecessary cause it has to be all of the pie, all of the sufficient causes.

552
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:25,960
Yes. Yes. Yes.

553
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:33,280
So sorry. Go ahead. Yes. So.

554
01:05:42,050 --> 01:05:46,820
Okay. Yeah. And that's why I. Thanks for sharing that.

555
01:05:47,750 --> 01:05:51,559
For chronic diseases, it might be slightly different in infectious disease.

556
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:56,510
And that's why I showed it. Two different types of examples for infectious disease.

557
01:05:56,930 --> 01:06:02,000
You will have that causative agent. Apparently all of the PIs.

558
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:08,090
But you also have a chronic disease context like example for lung cancer.

559
01:06:08,970 --> 01:06:14,010
You have smokers who develop lung cancer. You have people who do not smoke.

560
01:06:14,730 --> 01:06:17,850
They develop lung cancer. So it would be almost like an example.

561
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:22,770
This person was exposed to radon. This person was exposed to cigaret smoke.

562
01:06:23,510 --> 01:06:28,950
Maybe family history know multiple other factors are leading.

563
01:06:29,190 --> 01:06:35,790
Maybe they had other conditions that increase their susceptibility to developing lung cancer.

564
01:06:37,220 --> 01:06:44,380
Is that helpful? Yeah. Okay. This particular pie will be more in a context of chronic disease.

565
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:51,219
It won't necessarily apply to infectious disease because if it was an infectious agent, you will have g.

566
01:06:51,220 --> 01:06:53,380
G will have to be in this other pie.

567
01:06:54,280 --> 01:07:03,700
So when you process this information and process it in a context of is this an infectious agent or is it a chronic disease that's present?

568
01:07:04,060 --> 01:07:07,330
A great question. And great discussion.

569
01:07:10,810 --> 01:07:15,280
All right. So I know I've spent all this time, you know?

570
01:07:16,590 --> 01:07:23,750
Talking about castle pies and helping us think about how we get the development of disease in the population.

571
01:07:24,700 --> 01:07:34,720
This is conceptually helpful because when we conduct studies, we need to be able to understand why we have these different findings.

572
01:07:35,380 --> 01:07:42,880
But it can be challenging because we do not know all the causes or the pathways to the development of disease.

573
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:48,100
For some cases, it might be obvious, but for some cases it may not be.

574
01:07:48,130 --> 01:07:55,990
Some people may have a genetic predisposition to developing a certain outcome, and we just see what's diagnosed,

575
01:07:56,020 --> 01:08:01,570
but we don't see all of the internal pathways that lead to the development of that disease.

576
01:08:01,930 --> 01:08:05,440
So we as much as we are learning as we go,

577
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:11,020
this can be a little bit trickier because we often cannot identify the sufficient sets that would

578
01:08:11,020 --> 01:08:17,560
be necessary to to understand the pathways leading to disease among individuals in the population.

579
01:08:18,390 --> 01:08:22,370
And so we have so many different causes.

580
01:08:22,380 --> 01:08:29,100
We have environmental, we have chemical, we have physiological, genetic and social.

581
01:08:29,490 --> 01:08:33,540
Not only that, we have this big context to think about.

582
01:08:34,380 --> 01:08:41,640
Imagine when we have some of these categories interacting to produce disease.

583
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:44,760
It gets very confusing and so easy to lose track.

584
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:57,950
And so. We have another framework that was introduced by Sir Austin Bradford Hill, a well known statistician and epidemiologist,

585
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:04,100
and he provided this framework where in we can use different components of that

586
01:09:04,100 --> 01:09:11,000
framework to help us understand whether our finding from our individual study.

587
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:22,630
In the context of other studies conducted on in us on that same topic, whether we have some evidence that's pointing us toward causation.

588
01:09:23,460 --> 01:09:32,340
And so there are a total of nine criteria. And I'll go over those briefly so we can understand some of the steps that we use.

589
01:09:32,940 --> 01:09:45,150
And after that process, I will also talk about how Saw Hill talked about not all of these will be required to prove causation,

590
01:09:45,540 --> 01:09:53,580
but is a nice framework that we can use to help us evaluate, to make sure we don't have any other explanation for that.

591
01:09:53,600 --> 01:10:02,980
Our exposure disease. Our relationship. So the first relationship that the first criteria is temporary relationship,

592
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:14,590
that when we are evaluating the association between an exposure and an outcome, we have to ensure that the exposure occurs before the outcome.

593
01:10:15,630 --> 01:10:17,550
It might seem like this is obvious,

594
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:24,720
but it may not necessarily be the case when we have some study designs where we are looking at data collected at the same time.

595
01:10:25,230 --> 01:10:34,710
If the data are collected at the same time, then we are not quite clear about what factor came first or which factor came first.

596
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:41,430
And so when we are studying and trying to establish a causal relationship,

597
01:10:41,850 --> 01:10:48,540
we need to ensure that the exposure occurs before birth, before the outcome.

598
01:10:49,110 --> 01:10:54,870
So if we wanted to look at the relationship between radon exposure and lung cancer,

599
01:10:54,870 --> 01:11:02,100
we need to be able to document that individuals were exposed to radon before they developed lung cancer.

600
01:11:04,010 --> 01:11:08,690
The second one is strength of the relationship between exposure and outcome.

601
01:11:09,290 --> 01:11:16,370
And to do this, we can use measures of association to evaluate the relationship between the exposure and outcome.

602
01:11:17,230 --> 01:11:20,380
Measures of association. We'll talk about those later on in the semester.

603
01:11:20,740 --> 01:11:27,610
But you have your odds ratio. You have measures of relative risk, which would be the right ratio of the risk ratio.

604
01:11:27,910 --> 01:11:30,880
And we'll talk about how you calculate those measures.

605
01:11:31,180 --> 01:11:40,209
But these are measures that you calculate from your study that let you know whether it's a positive relationship or is it a negative relationship.

606
01:11:40,210 --> 01:11:46,150
Mini, is this relationship one where if you are exposed to all the exposure,

607
01:11:46,810 --> 01:11:52,450
you have a good outcome compared to a positive relationship where you are exposed

608
01:11:52,450 --> 01:11:57,670
to the exposure and then you have increased risk of disease among individuals.

609
01:11:58,180 --> 01:12:05,620
And then depending on how large that number is, you can see whether you have a weak association or whether you have a strong association.

610
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:12,970
Hills are also a criteria, also include a dose response relationship.

611
01:12:13,420 --> 01:12:22,270
And what this is referring to is that if you have an increase in exposure, are you able to document increased risk of the disease in the population?

612
01:12:23,620 --> 01:12:33,250
You will see quickly that this is not the only relationship that's causal are among the different exposure disease relationships that we study.

613
01:12:33,790 --> 01:12:43,240
So this is what he recommended at that time. You know, we've learned a lot of information since he proposed this thing in 1960 something.

614
01:12:43,780 --> 01:12:53,560
But it was a start in in helping us think about how we can establish whether an exposure or disease relationship is also.

615
01:12:53,950 --> 01:13:01,570
So you have some causal relationships where you have dose response more exposed, you have higher risk of disease,

616
01:13:01,870 --> 01:13:10,450
and then you have some relationships where it could be U-shaped, where lower and higher, and you have adverse outcomes.

617
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:14,710
If you have a moderate exposure, you have better outcomes.

618
01:13:15,250 --> 01:13:18,280
One example not too much exercise.

619
01:13:18,490 --> 01:13:23,380
Too much exercise can be harmful, but if you have moderate, you have health benefits.

620
01:13:24,010 --> 01:13:27,579
Iodine intake can be another example. Low exposure.

621
01:13:27,580 --> 01:13:32,020
High exposure can be harmful. Moderate exposure can be helpful.

622
01:13:32,140 --> 01:13:37,230
Yes. They are separate concepts.

623
01:13:38,010 --> 01:13:46,810
Temporal could be where you are establishing that the exposure is coming before your outcome, right?

624
01:13:47,220 --> 01:13:58,920
So if you want to study the association between, say, air pollution exposure and the development of or the person having a baby.

625
01:13:59,190 --> 01:14:04,350
Premature a premature baby. Many babies born before 40 weeks of gestation.

626
01:14:04,740 --> 01:14:09,270
So you start your study by getting the person's exposure history,

627
01:14:09,930 --> 01:14:17,340
and then you follow that person over time to see if they develop or whether they deliver a pre-term baby.

628
01:14:17,730 --> 01:14:22,380
So with that type of study design, which would be our prospective cohort study,

629
01:14:22,890 --> 01:14:32,880
you are able to say we were able to document the air pollution exposure beforehand and then we later documented that the person had a breach number.

630
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:35,760
Right. It can be for smoking history, too.

631
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:43,770
If the person you document that the person is a smoker, you follow them over time and see if they develop lung cancer.

632
01:14:44,310 --> 01:14:52,800
Then you have an ability to establish that the exposure of interest came before the person developed the disease.

633
01:14:53,370 --> 01:14:58,110
Right. We would go ahead. Yes.

634
01:14:58,410 --> 01:15:04,800
And the exposure has to come before the outcome to be able to establish causality.

635
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:10,940
Consistency will be our defining similar across studies.

636
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:19,670
So if you are conducting a study, here is somebody else at North Carolina conducting a study or maybe somewhere in a different country.

637
01:15:19,970 --> 01:15:26,030
Are you finding similar results? And by consistency, it doesn't mean that every single study we have the same results.

638
01:15:26,300 --> 01:15:27,500
But in general,

639
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:35,840
the basic building evidence would be that most of the studies have similar results as it relates to your exposure outcome relationship.

640
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:44,360
Biological plausibility is where you have identify a relationship between.

641
01:15:44,380 --> 01:15:48,370
So based on your data you've identified about a like I'm sorry,

642
01:15:48,640 --> 01:16:00,820
a relationship between your exposure and your outcome and then you want to be able to say something about how that exposure is related to the outcome.

643
01:16:01,300 --> 01:16:08,020
So for example, I'll go back to my type of studies that I do when I'm looking at air pollution and then birth outcome.

644
01:16:08,650 --> 01:16:17,200
So even though I have data that will say there is an association between exposure and outcome, how can I explain that association?

645
01:16:18,730 --> 01:16:25,600
What are some of the things or changes happening in the body that might be associated with that exposure and the outcome?

646
01:16:26,020 --> 01:16:30,160
So in this case, it would be inflammation.

647
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:35,439
When people are exposed to air pollution, then it leads to inflammation,

648
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:43,210
and inflammation can lead to other processes in the body that might cause a person to have the baby before 40 weeks of gestation.

649
01:16:45,350 --> 01:16:48,650
Okay. Let's call the time. Coherence.

650
01:16:49,100 --> 01:16:54,499
Coherence is really referring to, ah, the data we are finding in epidemiologic studies.

651
01:16:54,500 --> 01:16:58,310
So studies among people are consistent with lab data.

652
01:16:58,610 --> 01:17:02,390
So are we finding say if we are saying that.

653
01:17:04,650 --> 01:17:08,760
Placental cells are the ones that are going to be producing inflammation.

654
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:15,420
And we have some placenta cell samples if we put those samples in the lab and then expose them to air pollution particles.

655
01:17:15,530 --> 01:17:18,570
Are we going to see the production of inflammatory markers there?

656
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:24,300
So we want to be able to see if our data are matching from different areas.

657
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:29,350
Experiment. Well, modified exposure modified.

658
01:17:30,190 --> 01:17:32,019
So this is something that's important.

659
01:17:32,020 --> 01:17:42,250
But keep in mind, this is just a framework, but it may not necessarily be required for each particular component to be able to establish causality.

660
01:17:42,910 --> 01:17:49,330
Analogy are we find similar associations with other studies.

661
01:17:49,630 --> 01:17:55,690
So for example, smoking we know is associated or causes lung cancer.

662
01:17:56,200 --> 01:18:01,690
But are we finding the changes that are happening that lead to the development of lung cancer?

663
01:18:02,050 --> 01:18:08,950
Are we finding those changes to be similar in other smoking outcomes of disease relationships?

664
01:18:09,190 --> 01:18:12,490
So we are making comparisons across other types of studies.

665
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:20,410
And then finally, specificity is where exposure, the exposure is associated with one in one disease.

666
01:18:20,740 --> 01:18:26,770
And this particular criteria we know, is not correct, because we know, for example,

667
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:37,960
smoking is associated with a number of conditions lung cancer, asthma and a range of other factors in other chronic disease and other cancers.

668
01:18:38,260 --> 01:18:49,170
And so we would take health criteria with a grain of salt or a little bit of caution that helps us evaluate these associations.

669
01:18:49,180 --> 01:18:55,960
But we know we cannot wait for each of the criteria to be.

670
01:18:57,630 --> 01:19:06,330
Satisfied before we can say that a particular exposure relationship, exposure disease relationship is causal.

671
01:19:07,860 --> 01:19:14,520
So what the [INAUDIBLE] himself say that he said that this is really a framework and none of the

672
01:19:14,550 --> 01:19:20,850
nine viewpoints can bring indisputable evidence for or against the cause and effect hypothesis.

673
01:19:21,450 --> 01:19:22,859
But what we can do,

674
01:19:22,860 --> 01:19:33,540
we can use that to guide us in helping us be objective enough to understand whether the exposure outcome relationship that we are interested in,

675
01:19:33,750 --> 01:19:43,260
whether it is trending or tending to be causal based on data from our study and other studies.

676
01:19:43,290 --> 01:19:53,220
It cannot be based on one study. So I will stop here with this key takeaway we cover quickly.

677
01:19:53,240 --> 01:19:57,500
Nine criteria that Hill proposed.

678
01:19:58,330 --> 01:19:58,930
We've talked.
