1
00:00:02,401 --> 00:00:04,167
My name is Joanne Motino Bailey.

2
00:00:04,167 --> 00:00:08,499
I'm the Director of the Nurse Midwives at
the University of Michigan Health System,

3
00:00:08,499 --> 00:00:11,762
and I'm also a lecturer in
the Department of Women's Studies.

4
00:00:11,762 --> 00:00:14,700
I'm gonna give a brief
presentation on U.S.

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:19,522
Maternal Child Health,
some issues and ideas.

6
00:00:19,522 --> 00:00:22,093
Part 1, Maternal Mortality.

7
00:00:22,093 --> 00:00:25,819
The terms I want you to know
regarding maternal mortality,

8
00:00:25,819 --> 00:00:30,664
the first term is the maternal mortality
ratio which is the number of maternal

9
00:00:30,664 --> 00:00:33,296
deaths per 100,000 live births.

10
00:00:33,296 --> 00:00:37,790
A maternal death is the death of a woman
while she's pregnant and within 42 days of

11
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:42,280
a termination of a pregnancy from
any cause that is related to or

12
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:46,990
aggravated by pregnancy, but
not from accidental or incidental causes.

13
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:50,383
So examples of causes of
maternal death are sepsis,

14
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:53,477
which is an overwhelming
full body infection.

15
00:00:53,477 --> 00:00:57,577
A pulmonary embolism, which is a blood
clot that formed because a women

16
00:00:57,577 --> 00:01:02,062
had increased estrogen in her body
which is associated with pregnancy.

17
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:07,550
That then lodge in her lung and
she was unable to breathe effectively.

18
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:12,600
Pregnancy related death is death
of a woman while shes pregnant or

19
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,590
within 42 days of termination of
thepregnancy, irrespective of cause.

20
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:19,300
So that would include the other
examples that I've gave for you.

21
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:24,230
In addition, it would include homicide,
car accidents and

22
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:27,560
a host of other,
unrelated to pregnancy deaths.

23
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:32,232
Maternal morbidity is temporary or
permanent disability that is resulting

24
00:01:32,232 --> 00:01:35,448
from a pregnancy or
a termination of the pregnancy.

25
00:01:35,448 --> 00:01:38,381
So examples of this
are postpartum hemorrhage,

26
00:01:38,381 --> 00:01:40,990
which could lead to significant anemia.

27
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:43,050
So that would be maternal morbidity.

28
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:46,839
Preeclampsia which is
a hypertensive disorder or

29
00:01:46,839 --> 00:01:52,613
pregnancy leading to seizures or
endometritis which is a uterine infection

30
00:01:52,613 --> 00:02:00,949
after termination of a pregnancy either
through abortion or from a birth.

31
00:02:00,949 --> 00:02:05,420
Maternal mortality has decreased
significantly in the last 100 years.

32
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,950
And if we look at this graph here,

33
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:11,310
so this is a 1,000 and
here we're down to the teens,

34
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:15,920
we have decreased maternal mortality
by almost two orders of magnitude.

35
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,800
However, if we look here,

36
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:22,350
we have this recent increase in maternal
mortality rates in the United States.

37
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:26,760
Which is a warning flag for
all of us that something is going on in

38
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,100
our healthcare system
that we need to address.

39
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:33,283
Maternal mortality rates have recently
increased in the United States.

40
00:02:33,283 --> 00:02:36,035
And just as I showed before
they were increasing but

41
00:02:36,035 --> 00:02:40,262
if we compare that to other countries,
other wealthy countries of the world.

42
00:02:40,262 --> 00:02:45,064
We can see that maternal mortality
rates continue to decrease in all other

43
00:02:45,064 --> 00:02:46,920
affluent countries.

44
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:51,480
In fact, the only two countries that have
an increase in maternal mortality rates

45
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,230
outside of the United States
are Afghanistan and the Sudan.

46
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:59,980
And we know that those are two countries
that have significant social and

47
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,190
political turmoil.

48
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:07,000
Since 1987, our maternal mortality rate
has been increasing in the United States.

49
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,160
So this is a closer focus on that large,
100-year map that I showed you previously.

50
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:17,880
So we can see here, in 1987,
maternal mortality rate's about 7.2.

51
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:25,630
All the way to about 16 to 17 per
100,000 live births in the 2010s.

52
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:29,940
So there's a distinct problem
that we need to address.

53
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:33,990
If we look at the causes of
pregnancy related deaths,

54
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:38,640
it's actually chronic disease
seems to be the primary cause and

55
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,800
the contributor to the increase in
maternal mortality in the United States.

56
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:47,372
So non-cardiovascular disease,
issues such as thyroid problems,

57
00:03:47,372 --> 00:03:51,410
diabetes, or asthma, and
then, cardiovascular disease.

58
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:57,780
Myocardial infarction, arteriosclerosis,
hypertension fit in these categories.

59
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,280
And then we have down below, infection and

60
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:05,440
sepsis, hemorrhage, pulmonary embolism,
hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.

61
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:10,550
These are the more common ones that are
associated with maternal mortality in our

62
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:11,870
usual thought process.

63
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:16,670
But these other diseases are something
we need to pay more attention to.

64
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:20,130
So there's also a large
disparity in maternal mortality.

65
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:24,854
And if we look here,
our maternal deaths per 100,000

66
00:04:24,854 --> 00:04:29,669
live births by race we had 42.8
cases of maternal death for

67
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:33,690
black women and only 12.5 for white women.

68
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:40,150
So this is a tremendous disparity that is
not attributed to genetic differences,

69
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:46,330
but are other social and
political contributors to poor health.

70
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:50,890
So disparity reduction efforts can
be effective in addition to reducing

71
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:55,040
disparities we can also just
reduce overall mortality rates.

72
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,891
If we look at the California Department
of Public Health, they were able

73
00:04:59,891 --> 00:05:04,743
to both note the disturbing trend of
increases in maternal mortality for

74
00:05:04,743 --> 00:05:08,738
African American women we
went from 1999 to 2005.

75
00:05:08,738 --> 00:05:11,306
We went from 27 to 51.

76
00:05:11,306 --> 00:05:13,810
So a very disturbing trend.

77
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:16,500
And they were able to
reverse this trend and

78
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,370
actually come back to where
they were ten years ago.

79
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:23,266
So if we look at this change we can look
at what they're doing in California.

80
00:05:23,266 --> 00:05:30,769
We can apply some of these
interventions at a national level.

81
00:05:30,769 --> 00:05:33,172
If we look specifically in Michigan,

82
00:05:33,172 --> 00:05:37,430
we can see how pregnancy-related
deaths are distributed.

83
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:41,300
So accident, other, assaults and suicide.

84
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,370
So these are all pregnancy-related
deaths that probably would not fit in

85
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:47,350
the category of maternal mortality.

86
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:51,420
And then we have obstetrics causes and
medical that are not obstetric,

87
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:58,710
accounting for a little less than half
of the overall pregnancy related deaths.

88
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:02,590
So the burden of maternal morbidity
is much larger than the burden

89
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:04,060
of maternal mortality.

90
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:07,520
And so when we're talking about
maternal mortality reduction,

91
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,230
we also are talking about
maternal morbidity reduction.

92
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:17,870
For every one maternal death, we have at
least 100 cases of maternal morbidity.

93
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:22,450
And we know that maternal morbidity
continues to increase as well,

94
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:25,730
going hand in hand with
the increases in maternal mortality.

95
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:29,840
And it impacts a much larger
number of women each year.

96
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,420
So in the United States,

97
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:37,840
over 50,000 women each year are impacted
by severe maternal morbidity.

98
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,170
Rates of severe maternal
morbidity are also increasing.

99
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:47,280
And if we look here, so
this is from 1998 to 2011,

100
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:54,940
we see a marked uptick in the rates
of severe maternal morbidity.

101
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:58,020
So there are multiple national
efforts that are trying to improve

102
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,740
maternal mortality rates
in the United States.

103
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:05,110
One of the key aspects is defining and
monitoring both mortality and

104
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:08,940
morbidity more consistently
across our states.

105
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:13,530
For example, in Michigan it is
not a state level requirement for

106
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:18,820
hospitals to report a maternal
mortality case to the state.

107
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:21,520
Most do, but it is not a requirement,

108
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,660
so there is a potential that
we're missing some of the cases.

109
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:29,890
And in addition, when we're talking
about morbidity, there are no state or

110
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:34,990
national level data collection
regarding severe morbidity.

111
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:37,710
So we need to establish that.

112
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:43,010
One of the primary interventions, and this
is what has worked in California, is using

113
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:47,980
concurrent interventions what are often
referred to as bundles of interventions.

114
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:52,980
Very specifically targeted towards
addressing those primary causes of severe

115
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:55,070
morbidity and maternal mortality.

116
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:59,176
So for example,
in the hemorrhage bundled package,

117
00:07:59,176 --> 00:08:03,661
this includes provider education,
nursing education.

118
00:08:03,661 --> 00:08:07,972
Running drills in order to
have everyone prepared for

119
00:08:07,972 --> 00:08:11,716
dealing with a life
threatening hemorrhage.

120
00:08:11,716 --> 00:08:15,017
Having new assessments
that assess increased or

121
00:08:15,017 --> 00:08:19,130
changing risk factors during pregnancy,
labor and birth.

122
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:24,856
So it is a multi disciplinary,
multi focal way of addressing the problem.

123
00:08:24,856 --> 00:08:29,264
And there are also ones for
hypertension, for

124
00:08:29,264 --> 00:08:34,689
venous thromboembolism, and
preventing infection and

125
00:08:34,689 --> 00:08:39,444
even how to care for
women who are morbidly obese.

126
00:08:39,444 --> 00:08:44,062
We need to equip all of our obstetric
care providers with education and

127
00:08:44,062 --> 00:08:45,558
resources as needed.

128
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:50,339
This speaks to the importance
of continually refreshing for

129
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:55,588
all hospital staff and anyone who
works with women who are pregnant

130
00:08:55,588 --> 00:09:02,370
to continually refresh for them how to
deal with the most common emergencies.

131
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:07,140
And then finally to identify women at the
highest risk for maternal morbidity and

132
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,050
mortality.

133
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:11,450
And ensure that they have access
to risk-appropriate care.

134
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:16,520
A great example of this is if we look at
our maternal-fetal medicine specialists.

135
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:20,701
So these are specialists in complex
pregnancies in the state of Michigan.

136
00:09:20,701 --> 00:09:25,386
There is one maternal-fetal medicine
physician who is in the northern

137
00:09:25,386 --> 00:09:27,345
half of the Lower Peninsula.

138
00:09:27,345 --> 00:09:30,963
And then there are no maternal-fetal
medicine specialists in

139
00:09:30,963 --> 00:09:32,265
the Upper Peninsula.

140
00:09:32,265 --> 00:09:36,905
So it is a maldistribution of these
specialists in order to provide care for

141
00:09:36,905 --> 00:09:37,933
women.
