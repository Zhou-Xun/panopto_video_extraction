1
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:15,800
Hey, good morning, everyone. Apologies, I'm running a few minutes late.

2
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:24,710
Let's see, I want it to go ahead and start and just do a reset on on the calendar and schedule just to make sure we're all on the same page.

3
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:29,840
See if folks have any questions, but you know, primarily so that there's no no surprises.

4
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,820
I know it's getting really busy for everyone and you're managing more and more

5
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:40,970
with each passing day as we really begin to push towards the end of the semester.

6
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:47,720
So let's see. So starting with actually the the proposals,

7
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:55,610
I've already gotten a couple of inquiries about when do you expect to have the proposals graded and that sort of thing.

8
00:00:55,610 --> 00:01:06,380
A little bit of bad news and an apology from me on that part. So part of giving the extension on the proposal assignment basically erased the

9
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:11,180
time period I kind of had reserved in my own schedule for reviewing proposals.

10
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:22,490
So yay, we got an extension to work on them. But uh, bu professor now has no time to read them and get them graded, at least in a in a timely manner.

11
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:29,300
I'm actually I'm regretting it actually with each day this week and next week

12
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:35,420
have a lot of time commitments for a nice review panel that I'm serving on.

13
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:43,280
And so honestly, I just want to be kind of transparent. I'm not going to come above surface from that until like the end of next week.

14
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:51,140
So at this point, I basically have kind of next weekend as my opportunity to to be able to read and great proposals.

15
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:56,240
So hopeful. I mean, I know that everyone wants to know their grade and where they stand.

16
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:01,770
Um, but don't let you know time passing your anxieties.

17
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:06,440
It's just I actually won't even be getting to them until later next week.

18
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:16,230
Are there any early questions in general about the proposals, grades, et cetera, at this point?

19
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:27,750
OK, and again, Mike, my apologies for that. Advanced notice on the delay related to my service on this review panel.

20
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:33,510
So next week we'll have a guest speaker will actually be our last guest speaker for the for

21
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:41,800
the semester is Professor Juan Uji will be coming in on Tuesday to speak on the topic.

22
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:48,030
So today we're talking about air pollution and health and kind of analogous to that Professor G,

23
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:56,070
who this is really his area of expertize is going to be talking about issues around water quality and impacts on health.

24
00:02:56,070 --> 00:03:07,350
I will be on that kind of live over Zoom the entire day on Tuesday.

25
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:14,310
So I really, really like to be here, even when we have guest speakers to be able to kind of participate in the class and help,

26
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:22,500
you know, bridge discussions that we have and that there's consistency across class periods.

27
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,220
Unfortunately, I won't be here on that day on Tuesday.

28
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:31,710
So Professor G, what kind of you have a self introduction, you know, run the class himself.

29
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:34,980
So, so apologies for that.

30
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:42,930
That said, I don't I don't expect any any problems to arise from that, but just want to let you know you won't see me in the classroom on Tuesday.

31
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:52,320
And that's why. And then looking ahead to a week from today on Thursday, the 18th, we won't have lecture.

32
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:59,910
It'll be a lot of discussion and class divided across two different activities.

33
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:04,920
One is going to be our fourth and final installment of Exposure Science in the news.

34
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:14,760
I'll actually post a canvas announcement that spells out the details of it, but it's going to be similar to the previous three that we've done.

35
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:19,590
But it's going to continue to follow that theme, that theme of building what,

36
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:24,480
what aspects you're actually looking at and kind of interpreting and reporting on.

37
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:30,180
So again, choose a topic that's of interest to you for whatever reason.

38
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:35,730
If you recall the first one, it was identify a what?

39
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:41,250
Classify what type of hazard it is, right? Is it a chemical hazard or a biological hazard?

40
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:50,310
Physical hazard? What are the the primary roots of exposure that you might be concerned about in that case?

41
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:57,750
And what maybe are the environmental pathways of concern right for the pollutant in your specific article?

42
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:07,020
And then we've kind of been building, uh, going into what would be the types of measurement approaches right for measuring this?

43
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:11,430
We've just finished talking about opportunities for control of exposures, right?

44
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:18,000
So this hierarchy of controls, both in workplace settings and also in kind of more community environments.

45
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,150
So that's kind of the specific add on for this assignment is as you're going through that article,

46
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:30,810
um, when you come prepared to class on Thursday as part of your report out to address,

47
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:39,540
you know, what are the control opportunities there for to help reduce exposures within the context of your article.

48
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:44,460
So that'll be about half the class. The other half will be similar to what we did.

49
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:51,150
I don't know, maybe a month ago will break out into groups. There will be a specific assignment, no advanced work.

50
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:55,350
You don't need to do anything in advance yourself to class ready to participate,

51
00:05:55,350 --> 00:06:03,610
but it will also be addressing issues around control of exposure and going through some different example scenarios.

52
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:13,200
Any questions about that, and I will absolutely post a canvas announcement that basically spells out what I just said.

53
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:23,610
And then looking ahead to the following week, we will also not have a lecture on Tuesday, the 23rd.

54
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:33,450
I am again recognizing that it's usually getting busy this time in the semester, but it's just with the pandemic and constraints.

55
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:37,770
It's harder to actually find time to meet up in working groups.

56
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:46,140
So we'll be allocating a ton of time for that class action for you to actually work in your debate team groups moving ahead.

57
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:54,600
I mean, it's not that much further. Right? We have we won't meet on Thursday, the 25th for the Thanksgiving university's Thanksgiving holiday.

58
00:06:54,600 --> 00:07:00,660
And then, you know, it's on December 2nd that we actually have our first debate and move through those debates.

59
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:09,750
So I wanted to, you know, kind of help facilitate that interaction and planning and working together so we can have some discussion around it.

60
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:18,300
Time for Q and A. I can even kind of sit in on group discussions and give, you know, more personalized feedback if folks are interested.

61
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:26,610
And then, yes, we have the Thanksgiving recess on the 25th. So that's the next what the next couple of weeks will look like.

62
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:34,280
Any questions or comments or anything that I maybe left out?

63
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:48,820
Yeah, so, um, for the third to be the one that's for white students or Asian prisoners, are we going to watch those two?

64
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:56,470
Yes. So let's see. Great question. So let's just kind of go through the rest of the schedule for the semester, right?

65
00:07:56,470 --> 00:08:07,660
We all have a lecture on the 30th, uh, kind of a short lecture, maybe half the class period on December 2nd.

66
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:13,460
And then we'll have our first debate, same format on December 7th.

67
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:21,850
Uh, a short lecture. And then our second debate on Wednesday evening, December eight.

68
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:29,200
I've been meeting almost weekly with the group of remote students that are taking the class asynchronously,

69
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:36,220
and we'll be using that Wednesday evening Zoom session for them to actually do their debates live.

70
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:44,950
I will record it over Zoom and hopefully have that be posted very quickly in

71
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:51,790
cloud so that when we meet as a class for our last class period on on the 9th,

72
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:56,440
we can actually watch that debate recording together.

73
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:01,990
And the format of the first two debates is, you know, we go through that very structured debate, right?

74
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:07,210
Ten minute presentation, 10 minute presentation, two minute rebuttal to rebuttal.

75
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:11,890
We're going to have them vote on, you know, who won the debate. What do people think?

76
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:16,240
And then we kind of open it up for some discussion about the topic and everyone gets to

77
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:22,360
remove their assigned position and we can actually discuss the topic of the debate.

78
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:29,320
So we'll do the same thing on the ninth sort of pretend that they're the two groups are here in front of the room,

79
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:33,970
except they'll be up on the screen the recording from the previous night,

80
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:39,520
but will give us a chance to actually talk through the topic here as a group.

81
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:52,680
Great question. And the others.

82
00:09:52,680 --> 00:10:00,990
And just as I don't know. Hang in there, keep up the good work, rah rah, a little bit of cheering for me.

83
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:09,780
Almost everyone and I'm mentioning this because I know when people are struggling, there's so many complications going on in your life.

84
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:18,840
You feel like it's only you. Without giving away any personal information, I can tell you, it's it's almost everyone.

85
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:29,040
So many people, students, staff, faculty have just these these crazy burdens and things that they're managing.

86
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:35,490
You know, right now, it's I totally appreciate it's not just, wow, I have a test in this class and I have an assignment to do,

87
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:39,960
and they're all overlapping that you all are are managing so much right now.

88
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:45,030
So I just want to say I recognize that and I appreciate that.

89
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:50,790
Hang in there. From my perspective, in this class, you're all doing an excellent job.

90
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:55,650
So I appreciate it and keep up the good work. All right.

91
00:10:55,650 --> 00:11:04,470
Let's get into some lecture material. And if you recall, we didn't actually finish last class period.

92
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:08,550
So the first few slides, we're going to pick up and finish there.

93
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:13,530
But it's a really nice Segway because the example that I had are still around policy, right?

94
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:16,110
Control of exposures and communities.

95
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:26,160
The examples, we're focused on air quality, so we're going to very quickly slide into from that into air pollution and health.

96
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:37,860
All right. So this was kind of something that I wanted to conclude with a little bit last time within community environments, public spaces,

97
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:48,720
with that net hierarchy of control, our preference and our most effective is through policies and regulations in order to control exposures.

98
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:54,150
And unfortunately, it's much easier said than done.

99
00:11:54,150 --> 00:12:01,530
There is this philosophical interface, whereas exposure scientists, right?

100
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:03,090
We can conduct the studies.

101
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:13,560
We can make the measurements, we can review the literature, we can synthesize it all and come up with what from a science perspective, are excellent.

102
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:21,420
Scientific data inform strategies to reduce exposures through policy, through regulation, through standards.

103
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:33,720
Whatever it may be, the policy process itself, uh, brings in a lot of nonscientific realities that end up being, in many cases,

104
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:46,020
huge barriers to having that as scientists, what should be very easily implemented mitigation strategies, policies, regulations, et cetera.

105
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:50,880
And so right, you know, we've got a problem. We live in the world.

106
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:58,380
For the most part of this in environmental health sciences is this ideal pathway where we study things,

107
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:05,460
we analyze the data, we assess risks and we come up with what the policy should be.

108
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:17,040
And the reality of that process is that it takes into account many other factors not related to science that greatly impact where we actually end up.

109
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:22,170
And we often end up someplace we we would not rather be.

110
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:24,180
So I'll go through some examples of this.

111
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:33,960
And again, just as a, you know, those of you that are in the program, you'll be taking a course next winter on environmental, health and policy.

112
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:39,210
So it's kind of where this course ends and where we pick up is actually this question right here.

113
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:47,100
And explore the opportunities and challenges for policy and regulation through case studies and whatnot.

114
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:50,070
For those of you that aren't in HBP, if you're interested,

115
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:56,760
you reach out to me if the two credit class think think scheduled to meet on Tuesdays from one to three.

116
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:03,240
Right now, it's scheduled to meet in person. I'm hopeful that, you know that's how the winter semester unfolds.

117
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:06,700
But let me know if it's five ninety seven.

118
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:12,690
Let me know if you have any questions about that or if you're particularly interested in the policy aspects.

119
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:18,150
All right. So a couple of examples here with regards to air pollution.

120
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:26,700
It travels long distances, right? So it doesn't actually respect geopolitical borders within the US.

121
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:35,460
Right. We have all of these state borders. And then, of course, internationally, things get even more complicated from a from a policy perspective.

122
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:46,110
A couple of examples here talks caffeine is a pesticide very popular will use here in the US,

123
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:51,960
and it's been found in fatty tissues of mammals in the Arctic.

124
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:59,400
Including polar bears. So, you know, we're talking thousands of miles away from where the pollutant is emitted.

125
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:07,740
Another example is nitrogen oxides that get in the air and then are deposited to surfaces.

126
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:18,330
In the example here is that that deposited nitrogen contributes to fish kills through the growth of oxygen depleting algae.

127
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:25,890
And Professor Wu Ji is going to talk about this much more on Tuesday around issues of water quality and health,

128
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:33,000
but where the overlap between the air water interface and where deposition comes into play of it, specifically in Chesapeake Bay.

129
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:40,080
So this is on the mid-Atlantic part of the U.S., and a significant part of that.

130
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:45,360
Nitrogen is not coming from anywhere in the mid-Atlantic U.S. it's being transported

131
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:51,670
from power plants and industrial sources further upwind in the Midwest.

132
00:15:51,670 --> 00:16:02,250
And then similarly, those same power plant emissions across the US that emit anything that burns coal is emitting large amounts of sulfur dioxide.

133
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:16,960
Gas is contributing to acid rain and fine particle pollution problems in the eastern part of the U.S., some hundreds of miles away.

134
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,090
So a couple of updates to this.

135
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:26,770
So if you remember talking when we talked through the Clean Air Act, the structure and how it's implemented is at the local level.

136
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:31,550
So the federal government, right, the legislative body implements the Clean Air Act.

137
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:42,370
EPA kind of oversees and enforces it, but they give all of the monitoring, permitting and local enforcement to individual states.

138
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:48,940
If states aren't meeting the Clean Air Act standards like for those six criteria pollutants,

139
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:53,620
the states need to come up with an implementation plan and submit it EPA.

140
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:57,760
It says this is how we're going to reduce the levels of fine particles.

141
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:06,100
This is how we're going to reduce the levels of ozone, whatever the pollutant is, where the standards are not being met.

142
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:15,070
So what happens or what has happened for decades is that these examples that we just look through, right?

143
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:22,090
There's nitrogen, there's sulfur. There's other toxics that are being transported hundreds of miles or more.

144
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:25,660
Right? Certainly not contained within state borders.

145
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:36,400
So when the state of Maryland in this case is having troubles in Chesapeake Bay, it's really out of their control to address it.

146
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:43,060
It needs to be across state or a regional approach to it.

147
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:47,920
And so it's really amazing. It wasn't until 2011, right?

148
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:54,040
The Clean Air Act was implemented in 1970. There were amendments and seventy 77 in 1990.

149
00:17:54,040 --> 00:18:01,270
And it wasn't until 2011 that EPA finalized a rule called the Cross the air pollution rule,

150
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:07,150
which required states to significantly improve their emissions,

151
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:14,290
reduce their emissions that are known to contribute to pollution problems in other states.

152
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:18,010
Right down we end up where those emissions are.

153
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:27,690
So emissions in Illinois that perhaps are not impacting Illinois greatly if they were impacting the state of New York.

154
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:35,050
Right. So now the state of New York actually had a federal rule to respond to and could legally bring the state of Illinois into

155
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:44,890
their process of coming up with an implementation plan to help meet the standards for air quality in the state of New York.

156
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:51,430
Good question. So and we're actually going to we'll have a couple of examples and we'll have to do it in a little bit more detail.

157
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:56,670
But yeah, there are. There are ways to do it. A modeling is a very easy way to do it.

158
00:18:56,670 --> 00:19:04,360
The combination of monitoring data so that the states are actually required to monitor this in real time continuously.

159
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:10,180
So there's a really healthy kind of spatially distributed monitoring database.

160
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:15,630
So it's it's pretty easy to kind of say, all right, this is what the model shows, and that is the monitoring.

161
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:19,690
We know this is where it's coming from. But yeah, it's and this.

162
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:30,100
Perhaps this is why it took until 2011, because in the 1970s and 1980s, those capabilities weren't very much in place.

163
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:44,710
So, yeah, great question. On a similar timeframe, if you recall, when we discussed the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act,

164
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:52,270
Congress included as part of that legislation that EPA required control of toxic,

165
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:59,470
please remember those one hundred eighty nine hazardous air pollutants Mercury was was one of the biggest ones on the list.

166
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:10,690
And it took a long time over 20 years for EPA, working with stakeholders,

167
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:17,830
working with industry, working with local governments to actually come up with a standard.

168
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:23,860
So it was only in 2011, and it took a couple of years beyond that to actually implement it.

169
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:27,640
And it was the first standards to reduce emissions.

170
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:39,300
This was specific to power plants of mercury and other toxics like arsenic, acid, gases, nickel, selenium and cyanide.

171
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:49,500
All right, here is an example of policies were implemented, right, so the scientific process played itself out.

172
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:56,610
We have policies issued by government agencies, but sometimes they're actually in conflict with one another.

173
00:20:56,610 --> 00:21:08,820
So this is a really neat analysis from a few years ago looking at the impact of actually the title here, the hidden cost of U.S. agricultural exports.

174
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:18,240
So a little bit of backdrop farming in this country is a challenge from a profitability perspective.

175
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:27,240
We all need food and for the most part, farming, and I'm not a farmer and don't claim to really know that much about it.

176
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:33,300
But in general, the larger the more can be scaled up, the more crops that can be produced,

177
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:40,770
the more economically profitable it is, and the more incentive it is for farmers to actually farm.

178
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:48,480
So the U.S. Department of Agriculture subsidizes farming in the US.

179
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:57,210
And part of what works and economically and incentive and profitability for an individual farmer

180
00:21:57,210 --> 00:22:05,370
is to grow more food than actually what's needed in the U.S. in order to export it overseas.

181
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:14,760
Where that where there's a demand for it. And that's where that kind of economic profitability and vantage comes into play.

182
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:29,970
So for a lot of crops and exports, and they're all plotted here in the smaller grass, corn, poultry, pork, beef, wheat, cotton,

183
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:42,480
all of these, uh, agricultural exports, the domestic animals, the crops have ammonia emissions associated with them with their production.

184
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:48,550
So the big map here in the middle is looking at them collectively, right?

185
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:55,710
So all of the emissions just from the products that are exported, right?

186
00:22:55,710 --> 00:23:03,570
So this is kind of like erasing what stays within the U.S., the excess that's produced in order to export.

187
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:09,570
And again, to make farming more economically attractive or feasible.

188
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:12,750
These are the ammonia emissions collectively associated with it.

189
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:19,200
And then those emissions are broken out by each Typekit poultry, by corn and so forth on the smaller maps.

190
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:24,870
But as you can see, you know, it's concentrated in areas of the country where you might expect, right?

191
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:30,240
My geography is not actually very good, so feel free to correct me if I see a wrong state name.

192
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:38,250
Iowa is here and Presque Kansas, right?

193
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:47,010
OK. I'm doing good so far, so it's really in kind of the Central Midwest Plains.

194
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:51,210
Lots of names for this area. But, you know, to highlight here the kind of the red and orange.

195
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:57,580
This is where the the concentration of ammonia emissions are.

196
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:05,410
And then what happens and we're going to talk about it as we move into our lecture, this specific on on air quality and health,

197
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:18,040
but what happens is that fine particles, they can be directly emitted from a source, but they can also similar to ozone, be formed.

198
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:24,760
Secondarily, from other precursor emissions, so ammonia,

199
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:35,260
which is NH three that's emitted from many of these agricultural export products, the emissions associated with that travel downwind.

200
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:38,990
And they go over urban areas.

201
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:48,190
They travel hundreds of miles where they mix with those sulfur dioxide emissions, so too from from coal burning fossil fuels,

202
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:54,070
the nitrogen oxide emissions associated with different industries, motor vehicles and so forth.

203
00:24:54,070 --> 00:25:01,570
And the combination of the sulfur and nitrogen oxides with ammonia emissions helps us to form fine particles

204
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:09,640
in the atmosphere so significantly downwind of these emissions from ammonia or forming fine particles.

205
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:16,270
But then people are exposed to, especially in more populated areas.

206
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:25,780
So if we look at the particulate matter that's formed from those excess ammonia emissions,

207
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:36,250
you see that there's kind of a peak area which is going to be read about the border between the state of Indiana and the state of Ohio,

208
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:41,860
but it's shifted geographically, right? So this is kind of following like predominant wind patterns, for the most part.

209
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:46,360
Winds in the US go weather patterns go from west to east.

210
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:54,880
So if there's ammonia emissions that are concentrated here in Iowa, Kansas and Nebraska,

211
00:25:54,880 --> 00:26:00,130
it's a few hundred miles downwind that the that those fine particles are actually

212
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:05,620
formed and resulting in the highest concentrations in Indiana and Ohio,

213
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:11,290
but affecting, you know, Illinois, southern Michigan, northern Kentucky.

214
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:16,300
So this, again, is that the not the total fine particle concentration,

215
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:26,630
but fine particles that are formed specifically from ammonia emissions from the excess agricultural exports.

216
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:30,470
And then there's, you know, going back to this economic component, right?

217
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:39,890
So the USDA, as a federal government agency, is purposely subsidizing farming, right for the reasons that we talked about and it and it makes sense.

218
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:45,710
The U.S. EPA also as a federal government agency, is tasked with.

219
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:53,210
Right. Protection of our air quality, our water quality, etc. They have their own standards in place.

220
00:26:53,210 --> 00:27:03,740
And basically, what's happening is this USDA program for exported food agricultural products is putting

221
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:11,120
demands on EPA and its ability to to regulate and ensure standards and safe air quality.

222
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:17,780
From a revenue perspective, these are the states that are benefiting the most from that USDA policy.

223
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:23,270
Right. So Iowa looks like California is benefiting the most.

224
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:30,230
But in terms of these ammonia emissions in this case, study, Iowa considerably also Nebraska and Kansas,

225
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:38,270
which which makes sense and then downwind the health costs associate rate.

226
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:46,970
The impact of those additional exposures from the fine particles that are generated is putting huge demands on health,

227
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:57,320
and this is quantified through cost of care and it's primarily being impacted in Illinois and Ohio and then also significantly Michigan,

228
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:02,810
Indiana, Pennsylvania, New York and moving further into the Northeast.

229
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:14,300
So again, two federal agencies they're tasked with, you know, doing everything they're charged with as part of their mission of the agency.

230
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:18,020
They're coming up with, you know, logical approaches and implementing them.

231
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:22,430
But in this case, they're completely in conflict with one another.

232
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:32,000
Another example So here's a case where policies and regulations have actually successfully unfolded and there's still issues.

233
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,980
All right. Any any questions?

234
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:42,530
That's kind of like the the finishing up of exposure controls, looking specifically at some policy examples around community exposures.

235
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:50,380
Any questions before we Segway more specifically into air quality and health?

236
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:59,550
All right. So our objectives for the remainder of the class period are to understand the important

237
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:06,990
role that meteorology and topography actually play in resultant air pollution exposures,

238
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:17,430
the concentrations of pollution that are present. We want to be able to describe what are those emission sources that we're most concerned about.

239
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:24,360
Understand the chemistry that takes place in the atmosphere. This is one of the big problems that we face.

240
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:31,230
It is not just emitting a pollutant that directly comes out of a smokestack or a tailpipe.

241
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:39,810
It's knowing that chemistry is going to take place after something else has been emitted, which makes it much more challenging to regulate.

242
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:47,490
And along those lines, you know, we want to be able to appreciate, you know, what are the most problematic or persistent air pollutants.

243
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:59,520
And we're going to be focusing a lot on urban atmospheric chemistry and urban pollution exposures, taking us back a little bit.

244
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:09,510
If you recall, we were kind of trying to hit on that exposure and health kind of framework where we were looking at, you know what?

245
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:15,070
Our upstream factors, what are the sources leading to an environmental density?

246
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:19,740
Right. And we had our exposure pathways map. So in this case, we're absolutely, you know,

247
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:25,380
looking at the atmosphere as the atmospheric pathway of these pollutants that are emitted into

248
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:34,910
the air and then can travel long distances before they become a serious exposure concern.

249
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:43,850
So when we talk about air pollution problems globally and what we're mostly concerned about, what are the biggest problems?

250
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:52,940
It's basically the list here. One is urban smog, which is really what the focus of this material is on.

251
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:58,130
So particulate matter and ozone being the two primary drivers.

252
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:05,270
We're also very concerned about atmospheric deposition. So we kind of alluded to that a couple of times over the course of the semester.

253
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:15,080
But this is where Mercury and persistent organics come into play, where it's not so much our exposure through inhalation to something like mercury.

254
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:22,700
It's after that mercury is deposited, gets into an aquatic system, bio accumulates and then we're exposed through ingestion,

255
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:30,830
right as we eat the fish that is accumulated in stratospheric ozone depletion.

256
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:36,080
And there was some discussion last class period I wanted to actually clarify.

257
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,740
It can be a little bit confusing when we're studying environmental health.

258
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:48,260
When we talk about ozone ozone as a player in kind of two very independent environmental health concerns,

259
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:51,260
and it's related to two different layers in the atmosphere.

260
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:59,150
We're going to be talking a lot today about ozone in urban areas, which meteorologically is in the troposphere,

261
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:05,600
which is the lowest layer of the atmosphere where we all live down here along the surface.

262
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:14,300
There is another issue related to Ozone further up in the atmosphere where we spend very little time.

263
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:23,420
If you are, you know, one of these lucky folks that's going on rocket trips into space and whatnot, yeah, perhaps you're traversing the stratosphere.

264
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:28,190
I think you're still pretty well sealed from the outside atmosphere at that point.

265
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:33,650
But you've got to go up pretty high to get into the stratosphere in the stratosphere.

266
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:35,870
Ozone exists naturally,

267
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:44,690
and at that point it provides a protective layer that filters out what would otherwise be harmful ultraviolet light from the Sun.

268
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:51,470
So it affects us in terms of sunburns. Skin cancer actually damages.

269
00:32:51,470 --> 00:33:00,320
We just talked about crops. There's a significant amount of crop loss due to those that increase in ultraviolet light in a certain wavelength.

270
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:05,540
So we want to preserve the ozone in the stratosphere as a protective layer.

271
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:08,510
And over the last few decades,

272
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:20,060
the ozone in the stratosphere has become depleted because of chlorofluorocarbons commonly used in and refrigerants and other applications.

273
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:24,020
So these are synthetic chemicals that are produced.

274
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:38,540
They were actually very comprehensively tested for their toxicity and whatnot, and they were determined to be very inert, very safe, not harmful.

275
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:46,820
The issue is that all of those tests were conducted here at the surface, right in the lowest layers of the troposphere,

276
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:53,000
and they were widely utilized in refrigerants and many other applications.

277
00:33:53,000 --> 00:34:02,780
And as those appliances and applications began to age and whether they develop leaks.

278
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:13,130
And so these chlorofluorocarbons are able to leak out of a system and because they're inert, they travel long distances.

279
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:19,520
Unfortunately, they actually make their way up into the stratosphere once they get that high.

280
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:24,350
They're no longer inert. And the reason is because the ultraviolet light,

281
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:31,850
the wavelengths of light that high in the atmosphere are different than the ones down here on the surface of the Earth.

282
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:45,500
And so the halogen compounds on these chemicals can actually be cleaved off through photochemical reactions at that point.

283
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:53,780
Those allergens trigger a chemical reaction that converts ozone gas, which is O3 to oxygen gas,

284
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:59,120
which is O2, and that's how ozone in the stratosphere becomes depleted.

285
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:08,780
So that's bad. We want Ozone to be present in the stratosphere, and for the most part, exposure issues, you know,

286
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:15,260
for humans in the stratosphere are very small down here in the troposphere on the surface.

287
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:20,720
We don't want to be exposed to ozone. It's not providing, you know, any benefit to us.

288
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:26,390
It's actually very harmful when it's when it's inhaled as an oxygen.

289
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:32,940
So we have too much ozone here in the troposphere at the surface, and we're trying to reduce those levels.

290
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:37,140
Anyway, I just wanted to take a minute to kind of clarify, though, that it's confusing.

291
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:38,410
It's actually the same gas.

292
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:48,820
It's 03 in both layers of the atmosphere, but really different kind of context and concerns climate change, right, and greenhouse gas emissions.

293
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:56,220
This one is huge. We're not talking about today. We do have a lecture coming up on a couple of weeks where we will talk about it and then

294
00:35:56,220 --> 00:36:04,050
also indoor air pollution and especially household air pollution is a huge problem.

295
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:07,920
Huge exposure has huge impact on health. We're not talking about it today.

296
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:11,700
We do have a lecture coming up in a couple of weeks.

297
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:19,080
But again, if you were to kind of characterize what are the the primary challenges from from air pollution on a global scale,

298
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:22,860
this is this is for the most part, the list the one would point to.

299
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:32,070
And today we'll be focusing on on urban smog, but we'll get to a couple of the others a little bit later in the semester.

300
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:43,860
Persistent organic pollutants. So it's an operationally defined term so similar to Mercury.

301
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:50,460
That is, it's an element, right? It's ESG enough to actually exist in different forms.

302
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:54,960
It can be methylated. It can exist as a salt.

303
00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:03,000
But a lot of. So similar to sulfur in coal, right, the coals mined out of the Earth.

304
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,440
The coal is naturally enriched in sulfur. And then when it's combusted,

305
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:11,010
suddenly there's all this sulfur that's released into the atmosphere in the form of sulfur

306
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:17,340
dioxide that causes all kinds of problems to the environment into how mercury is similar.

307
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:31,320
It's naturally geologically deposited in lots of places, and then we have managed to to emit it and free it up into our world.

308
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:39,480
It does happen naturally. So volcanic eruptions as one example, wildfires as another,

309
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:46,710
more mercury than would otherwise be safely sequestered and not an exposure risk can be introduced into the atmosphere,

310
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:58,290
but a huge a long list of anthropogenic right or resulting from human activities that result in the liberation of Mercury into the atmosphere.

311
00:37:58,290 --> 00:38:07,920
A big one kind of going back to that. That's why the Mercury and Air Toxics Standard Rate and EPA issued about 10 years ago are so focused on power

312
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:16,020
plants because it was identified as the largest anthropogenic source sector responsible for emitting mercury.

313
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:23,540
And it's similar to sulfur when those fossil fuels are mined out of the Earth, where again, they're otherwise safe.

314
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:32,880
Right. We're not being exposed to things deep down in the Earth's crust once their mind and then burned to generate electricity.

315
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,160
That mercury is then liberated.

316
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:44,520
Mercury's a little bit unique in that it's one of pretty much the only trace of metal that is volatile at ambient temperature,

317
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:51,330
so it can exist as a gas, which gives it great potential to be transported all around the globe.

318
00:38:51,330 --> 00:39:01,980
It's the reason why. Similar to that toxicity, in example, you can talk about Arctic wildlife and look at you can measure it actually in snowpack,

319
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:08,340
high amounts of mercury in both the North and South Pole because of its ability to traverse the globe.

320
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:19,500
So persistent organic pollutants would be organic compounds that behave similarly in terms of their environmental fate, too, like Mercury.

321
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:23,580
So they're emitted. Um but uh.

322
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:28,260
For a long time, scientists have used the term like a grasshopper effect.

323
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:33,720
They're never destroyed. They just kind of continue to move from one location to the next.

324
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:36,390
So that's where that determined persistent comes from.

325
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:44,050
But then it's like it's a kind of a class of different organic pollutants that fit into that category.

326
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:53,800
All right, um, so we're focusing today on piano and why it's kind of explained in this graph here.

327
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:59,320
So when we look at global burden of disease, so this is deaths per year.

328
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:06,190
And then, you know, ranking what they are so at the top. High blood pressure, smoking and so forth.

329
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:14,230
You get through BMI, total cholesterol. You don't get very far down the list until you get to ambient particulate matter.

330
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:19,210
A little bit below that is household air pollution. We'll be talking about that in a couple of weeks.

331
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:24,880
Further down the list is Ozone. So you hear statistics.

332
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:33,790
The latest on the W.H.O. issued, I believe it was in September attributed seven million premature deaths each year,

333
00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:38,860
attributed to pollution attributed to exposure to air pollution.

334
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:45,790
But almost all of that, the vast majority of that is specifically attributed to particulate matter.

335
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:50,770
It's the primary driver of that global burden of disease from air pollution.

336
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:55,600
Ozone is also a significant but a little bit further down the list.

337
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:59,980
But this is why we're mostly concerned about these two pollutants.

338
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:07,690
When we talk about air pollution exposures and especially in urban areas, because that's where they exist in the highest concentrations.

339
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:15,880
Uh, almost all of the deaths attributed to air pollution and specifically particulate

340
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:22,390
matter come mostly from respiratory diseases and cardiovascular diseases,

341
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:27,730
and they're widely studied. They're very well characterized.

342
00:41:27,730 --> 00:41:35,740
The point I did a couple of screen grabs here of articles that were actually from earlier in this year that

343
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:44,830
we continue to learn more and more about adverse impacts from air pollution exposure that go beyond this,

344
00:41:44,830 --> 00:41:49,540
this large category of respiratory disease and cardiovascular disease.

345
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:58,930
Here's one linking air pollution exposure to permanent vision loss and just going to go through these quickly.

346
00:41:58,930 --> 00:42:06,770
A couple since the pandemic started that that put air pollution into perspective from in this.

347
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:15,250
This still holds true to this day. If you tally up deaths from COVID over the course of the pandemic,

348
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:22,180
they still pale in comparison to premature deaths from air pollution exposure on an annual basis.

349
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:30,960
Right. And these, you know, the air pollution epidemic is decades in the making and not ending anytime soon.

350
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:37,330
Uh, this was an interesting one for folks that study air pollution.

351
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:48,070
There's kind of two different approaches. One is if you already have an existing disease status, a comorbidity,

352
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:56,950
a vulnerable subgroup studying what are the air pollution, the impacts of air pollution exposure on that susceptible subgroup.

353
00:42:56,950 --> 00:43:07,480
Another way that folks study air pollution is looking at it as air pollution as kind of the causative factor in developing disease.

354
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:14,590
So if you're chronically exposed to air pollution, it's been found that it impacts things like insulin resistance,

355
00:43:14,590 --> 00:43:19,210
so it can kind of set you on a pathway to eventually developing diabetes.

356
00:43:19,210 --> 00:43:26,590
So with the with the COVID pandemic, you know, this was one that was realized early this year.

357
00:43:26,590 --> 00:43:33,070
A huge kind of urgent note went out through all of the institute's cardiovascular societies,

358
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:40,460
then was finding out the same thing that people that were exposed to higher levels of air pollution there,

359
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:49,570
this especially vulnerable subgroup for very poor outcomes related to COVID infection.

360
00:43:49,570 --> 00:43:59,700
I said I was going to try to get to this quickly. Here's another one. Air pollution linked to increase mental health, outpatient visits, visits.

361
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:03,850
So while we have decades in the making of scientific studies,

362
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:12,430
characterizing very well the adverse effects from air pollution and cardiovascular and respiratory outcomes and disease,

363
00:44:12,430 --> 00:44:25,460
with each passing month, we we learn more and more about how widespread these adverse effects are across a variety of health outcomes.

364
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:34,520
All right, so I think I showed this slide really early on in in the semester and we we tend to,

365
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:42,620
you know, in this field kind of identify different groups or industries as evil, right?

366
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:50,000
And they're the bad guys. And if if they stopped emitting all this terrible stuff, we would all be happy and healthy.

367
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:55,160
And I really wanted to kind of bring it around that, you know, the problem is kind of us, right?

368
00:44:55,160 --> 00:45:02,120
Like, we're for the most part, we're the ones that demand products, demand energy, demand transportation.

369
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:06,320
And this is kind of the ultimate source of those emissions in the first place.

370
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:09,500
Yes, there are really great examples where that doesn't stand through.

371
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:15,830
But generally speaking, you know, this is the reason for why we're at where we are today.

372
00:45:15,830 --> 00:45:22,100
And four p.m. and ozone, there is really an urban component to it, right?

373
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:29,960
It's where most of the world's population lives within within urban settings, and it's where most of that demand is.

374
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:41,940
So it's where most of those emissions are. So it's kind of a bad overlap right there for the highest concentrations are where most of us live.

375
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:46,740
I mentioned these two top priority urban air pollution issues.

376
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:53,760
Tropospheric ozone, again, it's not emitted right directly from a smokestack or a tailpipe.

377
00:45:53,760 --> 00:46:00,420
It's formed through chemical reactions that take place in the atmosphere from precursor emissions.

378
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:05,820
So there are nitrogen oxide emissions that come from things like power plants,

379
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:15,680
any type of fossil fuel combustion automobiles, right, those that burn gasoline and then volatile organic compounds.

380
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:22,320
Right. So these are organics that exist as a gas at ambient temperatures.

381
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:32,820
These can be actually smaller scale emissions, but the tally up to large numbers collectively as area sources.

382
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:39,300
So things places like drycleaners, print shops, auto shops that use a lot of solvents,

383
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:44,700
things like this, anything that has a volatile organics associated with it contributes.

384
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:55,740
And so these are the basic two categories of emissions that contribute to downwind atmospheric chemistry that forms ozone.

385
00:46:55,740 --> 00:47:04,770
We're also concerned about particulates particulate matter PM and we'll go through it in detail is tricky because it's both.

386
00:47:04,770 --> 00:47:12,270
There are some primary emission categories where PPM does come out of smokestacks, it does come out of tailpipes.

387
00:47:12,270 --> 00:47:16,890
But there's upper particulate matter that we refer to as secondary Panopto,

388
00:47:16,890 --> 00:47:24,690
not primary secondary pollutant, meaning that it's something that's formed downwind from other emissions.

389
00:47:24,690 --> 00:47:28,560
And we're talking about p.m. We're mostly concerned again about automobiles,

390
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:37,820
waste incinerators, power plants and other sources of high temperature combustion.

391
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:44,390
All right. So let's take a little bit of a dove into meteorology and combine it with topography.

392
00:47:44,390 --> 00:47:55,850
This is an important aspect of understanding kind of how you get the highest resulting concentrations of pollutants, especially in urban areas.

393
00:47:55,850 --> 00:48:01,820
So there are some important terms, and we'll try to explain them, at least at a basic level here.

394
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:06,350
You might have heard of something called a temperature inversion or there's an inversion in place, right?

395
00:48:06,350 --> 00:48:13,700
There's an air quality alert. We have an inversion in place. Wind speed and direction are really important.

396
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:17,180
I mean, it's almost intuitive, right? Something's emitted.

397
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:25,850
You're concerned about which way the wind's blowing. But actually, the lack of wind ends up being very important as well.

398
00:48:25,850 --> 00:48:35,000
And then vertical motion, which kind of comes into play to determine whether an inversion is in place or not,

399
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:40,470
but under calm conditions primarily driven like you might,

400
00:48:40,470 --> 00:48:45,560
I don't know, see a weather report or read a weather report and it talks about high pressure,

401
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:51,440
high pressure system, a low pressure system right when we have high pressure in place.

402
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:56,930
It means that we have sinking air or subsiding air, not rising air.

403
00:48:56,930 --> 00:49:02,030
That is what gives us those cloudless blue sky sunny days.

404
00:49:02,030 --> 00:49:08,240
That's great. But it also basically suppresses wind on a on a regional scale.

405
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:21,350
So we have high pressure in place. Sunny days is when we have low winds, little vertical motion and the opportunities for inversions to form.

406
00:49:21,350 --> 00:49:29,920
So for the most part, if we go up into the atmosphere, the temperature generally cools, the higher we go.

407
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:34,550
Um, if if folks have flown recently or when you fly,

408
00:49:34,550 --> 00:49:39,650
if you're like me and like the time goes by so slowly and you're maybe staring at that stupid screen in front of you,

409
00:49:39,650 --> 00:49:44,420
that's giving you like how fast the plane is going and how much more time you have to get there.

410
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:48,920
One of the things that reports is like, what's the temperature outside, right? Like, I don't know, do people really care about this?

411
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:54,680
But like, they're updating it like on a minute by minute basis, but it's usually like this ridiculously low number, right?

412
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:59,480
It's like literally we below freezing as you're flying.

413
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:08,300
Maybe more realistically, if you're someone who likes to hike in the mountains right and with altitude, the temperature drops dramatically.

414
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:15,290
Right? The further up you go. So that allows air.

415
00:50:15,290 --> 00:50:25,460
So you've heard the term warm air rises, right? So this actually happens when the sun reaches us.

416
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:35,240
Solar radiation reaches us, and it's not actually the sun's rays traveling through the air that warms the air.

417
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:46,850
What happens is that all of the surfaces of the Earth, whether they're natural or anthropogenic from from humans built environment,

418
00:50:46,850 --> 00:50:54,710
absorb the sunlight and then give that energy back off in the form of infrared radiation.

419
00:50:54,710 --> 00:51:00,410
So the so the Earth, the air actually warms from the surface, right?

420
00:51:00,410 --> 00:51:09,800
So that makes sense. The air that warm air rises and the warmest air is right here at the surface and it gets cooler as we go up, right?

421
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:15,500
So in cases where there's a temperature inversion in place.

422
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:19,640
This happens when the inversion means that it's not.

423
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:25,640
So here's a plot of altitude going up, temperature going to the right.

424
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:34,370
So if we follow this trace, the temperature is decreasing as we would expect it to the further we go into the atmosphere.

425
00:51:34,370 --> 00:51:38,120
There can be cases and again, the related to high pressure.

426
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:49,610
Very stagnant air usually happens at night or in the early morning hours where heat from the previous day has risen up,

427
00:51:49,610 --> 00:51:56,420
but to the point where it's actually warmer aloft, the air is warmer, higher up.

428
00:51:56,420 --> 00:52:04,850
So the concept of warm air rising can only happen if the air above it is cooler.

429
00:52:04,850 --> 00:52:10,760
If air is trying to rise and it means air that's a warmer, it will stop rising.

430
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:14,840
So this is the case when we have a temperature inversion in place.

431
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:26,240
So here we have warmer air aloft and any emissions at the surface, any pollutant that's in those air parcels can no longer continue to rise.

432
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:33,770
So our atmosphere ends up being providing a little bit of assistance in general for air pollution emissions.

433
00:52:33,770 --> 00:52:42,450
It gives some volume for those polluting. To kind of disperse into right and effectively lower concentrations,

434
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:50,370
but in the case of an inversion being present, it applies basically a virtual cap,

435
00:52:50,370 --> 00:52:55,080
a vertical cap to the atmosphere so that whatever is emitted at the surface can't

436
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:59,400
continue to go further up into the atmosphere and dilute and concentration,

437
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:09,000
it keeps it trapped down near the surface. It's also often coincident again with very stagnant conditions, so low wind.

438
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:17,280
So there's not wind to actually horizontally disperse the air, either to kind of like below it left or right.

439
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:26,880
So it basically sets up. It's hard to see this in reality, but it's it's a virtual cap where pollutants that are emitted at the surface.

440
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:35,430
And this is especially a problem in urban areas where we have high density of emissions, factories, automobiles and so forth, all in one location,

441
00:53:35,430 --> 00:53:44,070
all emitting and under specific conditions like this very little air to actually dilute into that can result in high concentrations.

442
00:53:44,070 --> 00:53:52,710
Again, where we are, where we live, where we work, where we play, etc. is the inversion where it is?

443
00:53:52,710 --> 00:53:58,080
Yes. So air pollution meteorology, for the most part, is all taking place in the troposphere.

444
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:03,030
So everything today that we're talking about with an ozone,

445
00:54:03,030 --> 00:54:13,580
it's actually probably the lowest 10 percent of the troposphere, the very lowest layer of the troposphere.

446
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:22,340
Here's kind of an example. Hopefully reinforcing what I what I just said.

447
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:32,900
Here we have. So now we're bringing topography into play. So it's actually I'm going to turn this around and see if this sounds logical or not.

448
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:42,470
So there are across the world, there are a lot of cities, urban areas that are located in valleys.

449
00:54:42,470 --> 00:54:50,430
Why? Why would that be? And remember, they got their own bodies of water.

450
00:54:50,430 --> 00:54:56,490
Yeah, right, so in many cases, values are there because of rivers, right?

451
00:54:56,490 --> 00:54:58,230
And over long periods of time.

452
00:54:58,230 --> 00:55:10,830
And so you have a river valley, so access to water might be for drinking with kind of modern industry for transportation.

453
00:55:10,830 --> 00:55:14,910
Right. And are cooling from an industrial perspective or something like that.

454
00:55:14,910 --> 00:55:26,460
So lots of good reasons. And it's the reality many people live in in river valleys where we have a significant elevation on either side.

455
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:29,430
Topographically.

456
00:55:29,430 --> 00:55:40,620
So you all of the things that come again with that urban population or a large population also bring, you know, air pollution emissions.

457
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:47,820
So in that in the same case where we have this temperature inversion in place and we have a vertical cap right now,

458
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:51,180
we actually have physical barriers on each side.

459
00:55:51,180 --> 00:56:01,500
So this is showing during the daytime here we have sunlight and it's coming down and it's warming the Earth's surface.

460
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:05,910
The Earth is giving that energy back office infrared radiation, right?

461
00:56:05,910 --> 00:56:14,190
It warms the air and then that those air parcels slowly rise and cool as they rise,

462
00:56:14,190 --> 00:56:19,620
and the pollutants that are emitted can rise with those air parcels.

463
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:28,530
And here we're kind of looking at an idealized temperature profile where the air continues to cool with altitude,

464
00:56:28,530 --> 00:56:36,330
looking at the nighttime or perhaps early the next morning, and we have an inversion in place.

465
00:56:36,330 --> 00:56:47,130
Now we have that effective cap right where those emissions aren't able to dilute high up into the atmosphere, they're effectively capped.

466
00:56:47,130 --> 00:56:57,090
They also can't blow from side to side to be removed from that urban environment because they're bounded inside by these mountain valleys.

467
00:56:57,090 --> 00:57:05,520
So it's basically trapping all of these emissions, resulting in high air pollution concentrations.

468
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:13,290
This is actually a photograph. I don't know if anyone's bent to Utah Salt Lake City is.

469
00:57:13,290 --> 00:57:23,370
This has historical air pollution issues, and this is looking at a photo that's taken from from one side of the valley high up at altitude.

470
00:57:23,370 --> 00:57:31,080
Looking across the valley to the other side, you can see the mountains here and Salt Lake City is actually down here.

471
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:41,190
You just can't see it. And what you can see is this pollution layer impacted by an inversion that's in place.

472
00:57:41,190 --> 00:57:48,990
So we have warmer air aloft, it's trapping right, everything in the cooler air below it.

473
00:57:48,990 --> 00:57:57,660
So those emissions that are continuing to take place from from industry, from fossil fuel combustion, from motor vehicles, it's being emitted.

474
00:57:57,660 --> 00:58:04,080
It's being capped vertically by an inversion and it's being capped horizontally by mountains.

475
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:10,410
And so pollution is able to accumulate to significantly high concentrations.

476
00:58:10,410 --> 00:58:19,140
And this you can Google and find photos like this, you know, in many cities around the globe.

477
00:58:19,140 --> 00:58:28,240
All right. Actually, so any questions about the combination of meteorology and topography specific to the mountains and valleys?

478
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:36,010
OK. Another one. I love giving this lecture in mid-November when it's getting cold and yucky outside.

479
00:58:36,010 --> 00:58:42,340
We can just take a moment and kind of like pause and look at some images like this.

480
00:58:42,340 --> 00:58:45,700
You know, the best class would actually involve center field trip, right?

481
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:49,840
And we would like to be there talking about this topic.

482
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:55,300
Unfortunately, I don't have that many powers to make that happen. All right.

483
00:58:55,300 --> 00:59:01,180
So as we as we get Maya, this really nice scene, uh, I don't know.

484
00:59:01,180 --> 00:59:07,540
I guess maybe a show of hands who's who's been to a beach and broadly speaking, OK.

485
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:18,630
Lots of hands. That's great. Think about being at the beach again, this is this is a positive exercise, right today.

486
00:59:18,630 --> 00:59:25,380
Think about the even close your eyes if it's if it's helpful. Think about being at the beach and just using your senses, right?

487
00:59:25,380 --> 00:59:34,620
You're your what you see, what you feel, what you feel, or perhaps what you taste or smell.

488
00:59:34,620 --> 00:59:51,740
What do you what do you note being at the beach? Try, take a minute, think about it and just go ahead and spout out anything that comes to mind.

489
00:59:51,740 --> 01:00:01,160
Wind, so Melissa says there's wind at the beach. Is it coming from a particular direction?

490
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:06,290
So very often it's coming from off the water onto the shore.

491
01:00:06,290 --> 01:00:16,300
Excellent. What else? Very on the air at the time of the year, the same as is if you have a few cold.

492
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:16,900
Yeah.

493
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:25,420
So, you know, even if it's middle of summer or you're in some tropical location or something and you're you're walking on the sand and this is hot,

494
01:00:25,420 --> 01:00:29,740
sunny day, like, holy cow, it like literally burns your feet, right?

495
01:00:29,740 --> 01:00:35,890
And and yes, it can also be very cool for anybody who spent time on the beach at night.

496
01:00:35,890 --> 01:00:42,190
Right? The sand can be quite cool. Excellent observation.

497
01:00:42,190 --> 01:00:51,720
What else? These are good.

498
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:57,600
I'm looking for a couple more was released on.

499
01:00:57,600 --> 01:01:07,230
Salty, yeah, so how do you how are you? I mean, you see the water in the other senses come into play there.

500
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:12,540
So, OK, so you maybe you feel it right on your skin.

501
01:01:12,540 --> 01:01:16,470
Maybe you taste it. Maybe you see it like coating stuff, right?

502
01:01:16,470 --> 01:01:27,550
So see spray. OK. It smells like fishy, kind of be kind of smelly.

503
01:01:27,550 --> 01:01:36,920
Right, the marine environment can have some specific sense to it, which oftentimes are even unpleasant, right?

504
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:45,680
It can be hazy and can be hazy. So where where do you see the haze in the distance?

505
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:55,220
OK, which would direction looking towards the water down the beach or like inland usually?

506
01:01:55,220 --> 01:02:01,590
OK. These are great.

507
01:02:01,590 --> 01:02:09,540
Anything else? The sunsets, I'm not really comfortable.

508
01:02:09,540 --> 01:02:21,300
Absolutely, yeah. So sunsets, and if you're like me, sunrises are very similar effect that makes it look very pretty.

509
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:30,300
And in some cases, it's from reasons that are totally OK. In other cases, it's from regions that are terrible for why they're why they're so pretty.

510
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:36,060
All right. So nice work. Thanks for that exercise. And hopefully like a very small mental break, you know,

511
01:02:36,060 --> 01:02:44,190
from our reality to this beautiful location or maybe times in the past and where you've been able to experience that.

512
01:02:44,190 --> 01:02:45,150
All right. So, yeah,

513
01:02:45,150 --> 01:02:59,530
so the point here is to talk about Seabreeze effects and similar to there being a large population of the world that lives in mountain valleys.

514
01:02:59,530 --> 01:03:07,440
There's also a very high percent of the population of the world that lives in ocean coastal areas.

515
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:17,910
Again, for kind of logical reasons, right? Access transportation, it's where facilities are built, it's where jobs are access to a lot.

516
01:03:17,910 --> 01:03:26,580
Lots of basic things is the driver who why we have high concentrations of people along coastal areas.

517
01:03:26,580 --> 01:03:30,240
So, yeah, so you basically did a great job of setting the stage.

518
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:36,900
So in the same way that we we think about sunlight coming down and hitting the surface of the Earth,

519
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:42,570
right, and then having that energy being given off in the form of infrared and heat.

520
01:03:42,570 --> 01:03:49,200
So in a coastal environment, we talked about the sand being hot, right?

521
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:57,630
So the sand does a much better job or the land in general, but the sand is what we actually notice when we're at the beach, right?

522
01:03:57,630 --> 01:04:11,610
But the land does a much better job of taking in that sunlight, that solar radiation and giving it back off heat versus the water.

523
01:04:11,610 --> 01:04:18,090
So we basically have uneven heating and a coastal environment during the daytime.

524
01:04:18,090 --> 01:04:26,760
When it's sunny, it's giving that off and we have warm air rising right over the land.

525
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:32,010
The atmosphere is always trying to equilibrate itself.

526
01:04:32,010 --> 01:04:38,700
So if warm air is rising, it's looking to replace that air with something.

527
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:45,690
And on the coastal environment, it replaces it with cooler air that's located very nearby over the water.

528
01:04:45,690 --> 01:04:51,240
So this cool air that's over the water gets pulled onshore.

529
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:56,850
So that's why when you're at the beach during the daytime, especially in the summer, on a sunny day,

530
01:04:56,850 --> 01:05:09,300
you often will have a breeze coming off the ocean from the water to the land, and that there's a strength, a relative strength of that sea breeze.

531
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:18,600
So if you get in a car or a bus or train or whatever it is and go significantly inland, even maybe a few miles, you might lose that breeze.

532
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:24,090
You might notice like, Hey, it's where's the breeze? It was really nice and breezy at the beach is not here anymore.

533
01:05:24,090 --> 01:05:29,040
And that's kind of a relative measure of the strength of that sea breeze.

534
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:39,090
So it sets up the circulation so that warmer air that's rising as this cooler air gets pulled in at lower levels of the atmosphere,

535
01:05:39,090 --> 01:05:48,240
then takes this warm air and says, Hey, we need to reach equilibrium and draws that warm air aloft back out over the water.

536
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:58,200
So it kind of sets up this circulation where we have air coming from over the water, over the land to over the land,

537
01:05:58,200 --> 01:06:05,880
at the surface and then air moving from the land out over the water at higher elevation.

538
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:11,660
So how does this come into play? Why is this an issue with regards to air pollution?

539
01:06:11,660 --> 01:06:17,580
Uh, so we talked about high population density, lots of urban areas,

540
01:06:17,580 --> 01:06:23,820
lots of people living in coastal areas, all of this stuff that comes with it, right?

541
01:06:23,820 --> 01:06:29,880
The power plants, the manufacturing facilities actually use this water to cool a lot of the processes,

542
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:36,300
and a lot of them are located literally right on the the coastal shore.

543
01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:43,050
Also, the cars that we all drive in these coastal environments, all of these emissions,

544
01:06:43,050 --> 01:06:48,210
they're all being moved back out aloft under a Seabury scenario.

545
01:06:48,210 --> 01:06:55,260
So actually, when you're on the beach and you're looking out over the water and saying, Wow, it's so pretty.

546
01:06:55,260 --> 01:07:02,310
Wow, the sunset is incredible. The sunrise is so pretty. Or maybe even haze, right?

547
01:07:02,310 --> 01:07:08,010
And you you're thinking, Oh, this fresh air, you know, it's coming, you know, from.

548
01:07:08,010 --> 01:07:16,170
Across the sea, across from another continent, you know, it's like this clean, fresh air in urban areas along coastal environments.

549
01:07:16,170 --> 01:07:23,490
It's it's very often the pollution that was admitted that rose up to elevation was drawn out over the water

550
01:07:23,490 --> 01:07:33,690
and then is being brought back onto shore at a lower level so we can actually be breathing in pollution.

551
01:07:33,690 --> 01:07:44,520
Worse than that is that this circulation that happens on a diurnal basis provides a mechanism so that infection doesn't take place, right?

552
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:49,560
Like, we gave those examples of emissions in the Midwest and then it's transported hundreds of miles.

553
01:07:49,560 --> 01:07:54,960
And you know, unfortunately, people in the Northeast part of the country are impacted in this case,

554
01:07:54,960 --> 01:08:03,720
kind of similar to that vertical temperature inversion and physical mountains trapping pollution.

555
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:14,710
This Seabreeze circulation can actually also trap pollution and not allow it to be adapted and kind of blown away.

556
01:08:14,710 --> 01:08:21,050
And is this making sense, any questions about kind of the Seabreeze effect, why we're concerned about it,

557
01:08:21,050 --> 01:08:28,860
knowing that we have large population centers and lots of people potentially exposed coastal environments?

558
01:08:28,860 --> 01:08:34,950
OK, great. All right. This one. This is meant to be open ended.

559
01:08:34,950 --> 01:08:41,910
Here's a picture not offering any details other than what you see on the screen.

560
01:08:41,910 --> 01:08:57,150
Based on our discussion over the last 20 minutes or so, what's going on here?

561
01:08:57,150 --> 01:09:03,740
Gasoline is going up, but it's not diffusing further upset and my feelings are needed in that area.

562
01:09:03,740 --> 01:09:09,650
OK, so there are some I don't know what this is, some sort of admission.

563
01:09:09,650 --> 01:09:16,370
Clearly, the plume is going up and then, uh, it doesn't go up anymore.

564
01:09:16,370 --> 01:09:27,000
Right. And it's kind of like it's being distributed horizontally instead at a certain capped altitude.

565
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:36,980
Uh, so self sailing is suggesting that perhaps there's like some sort of inversion or cap in place, and that's why we see what we see.

566
01:09:36,980 --> 01:10:01,330
What else in the picture would support that being true. Yeah, but it's at a lower elevations of the mountains on the other side are also dropping.

567
01:10:01,330 --> 01:10:05,800
OK, so there's definitely some topography that could come into play.

568
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:10,390
I'm not like an aquatic ecosystem guy, but uh.

569
01:10:10,390 --> 01:10:15,310
And tell me if you think this is true. To me, this idea, actually, no, no history about this boat.

570
01:10:15,310 --> 01:10:19,690
And we just thought it was a really cool one to talk about air pollution.

571
01:10:19,690 --> 01:10:28,720
This looks like some sort of, uh, either a dried up river bed or maybe some like coastal zone, like where the tides come in and out, right?

572
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:31,180
And its happens to be low tide.

573
01:10:31,180 --> 01:10:40,750
I don't know what, but yeah, this looks like some sort of valley with perhaps some topography going on that can help to kind of trap things.

574
01:10:40,750 --> 01:10:49,930
What else would support the proposal that we have of a temperature inversion in place?

575
01:10:49,930 --> 01:10:53,680
There's like a thousand times more like tiny customers, those people.

576
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:59,500
Absolutely. It's a it's a clear blue sky, right? So there's no cloud formation.

577
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:05,140
We very likely have high pressure in place at this point. So what's suppressing that vertical motion?

578
01:11:05,140 --> 01:11:23,580
What else comes along with that high pressure? With regards to wind, it's very, very cold, so, so stagnant conditions, right?

579
01:11:23,580 --> 01:11:30,810
So if there was wind, this plume that's rising, it would actually blow in a direction, right?

580
01:11:30,810 --> 01:11:35,940
It would be blowing, you know, maybe left, maybe right. And this case is not it's just kind of going up.

581
01:11:35,940 --> 01:11:40,410
And it's kind of like slowly like wafting and spreading out in all directions, right?

582
01:11:40,410 --> 01:11:45,600
So we might very likely have very stagnant conditions.

583
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:52,500
Any other observations here? All right.

584
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:59,700
I think you absolutely nailed this with what you've just walked through and would be my interpretation as well.

585
01:11:59,700 --> 01:12:07,230
There's high pressure in place from the evidence here of a clear blue sky further

586
01:12:07,230 --> 01:12:16,230
supported by likely stagnant air because of there's no clear plume direction to the wind,

587
01:12:16,230 --> 01:12:25,950
any existing wind might be blowing it. It's clearly topping off at a certain altitude and not rising any further.

588
01:12:25,950 --> 01:12:32,910
And then, yeah, the topography inherent here from the mountains is likely not not helping the situation.

589
01:12:32,910 --> 01:12:40,170
All right. Great job. That was perfect. Uh, I'm already like behind time, but I'm sorry.

590
01:12:40,170 --> 01:12:44,360
I'm going to apologize that we hovered for too long looking at the pictures of the beach.

591
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:51,720
And so our top pollution issues again, tropospheric ozone and particulate, let's jump into ozone,

592
01:12:51,720 --> 01:13:00,060
and then we'll probably have to pause and finish with PM when we pick up a couple of weeks, I guess, based on the schedule.

593
01:13:00,060 --> 01:13:04,080
So Ozone is a colorless gas again.

594
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:11,910
It's formed with nitrogen oxides, and volatile organic compounds chemically react in the presence of sunlight.

595
01:13:11,910 --> 01:13:18,480
So because it's formed in the atmosphere, it's called a secondary pollutant.

596
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:24,090
Lots of chemistry here that you don't need to know the details of, but you know,

597
01:13:24,090 --> 01:13:28,050
kind of some icon showing, you know where those emissions can be coming from.

598
01:13:28,050 --> 01:13:36,540
Those precursor emissions can be coming from winds coming to play and how ozone can be formed.

599
01:13:36,540 --> 01:13:44,850
Uh, some good news, bad news. Uh, Ozone has been a criteria pollutant, uh, for decades,

600
01:13:44,850 --> 01:13:53,760
and so there are standards in place and regulation in place and on the on the negative, I guess on the positive side.

601
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:57,960
Ozone concentrations have been coming down. This is going back to 1980.

602
01:13:57,960 --> 01:14:08,370
So over that roughly 40 year time period, there's been about a thirty five percent decrease in the national average level of ozone.

603
01:14:08,370 --> 01:14:18,660
And you see it kind of trailing down here in relation to the national standard, the EPA Max that's drawn in by the dotted line.

604
01:14:18,660 --> 01:14:23,050
That's good, but it's also not great, right?

605
01:14:23,050 --> 01:14:33,240
Like you would think with 40 years of regulation and effort that this would be a steeper decrease, a more dramatic decrease.

606
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:39,990
And the reason it's not is that ozone is problematic. The fact that it's a secondary pollutant makes it really hard to regulate,

607
01:14:39,990 --> 01:14:49,410
and there are so many precursor emissions in those two categories that need to be controlled in order to prevent ozone from being formed.

608
01:14:49,410 --> 01:14:58,450
That absolutely make it a challenge in terms of, you know, geographically areas that are meeting the standards.

609
01:14:58,450 --> 01:15:07,860
So this is as of a few months ago, you know, regions of the country that are classified as being in non attainment.

610
01:15:07,860 --> 01:15:14,220
So not meeting the standard rates and the levels are above the standard, there are quite a few places.

611
01:15:14,220 --> 01:15:21,120
Uh, again, I don't have the strongest geography, but for the most part, they're focused on around urban areas, right?

612
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:25,590
Which again, makes sense. And that's why we're concerned about ozone in urban areas.

613
01:15:25,590 --> 01:15:29,280
Salt Lake City that we looked at an example is one of these two.

614
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:38,520
I don't remember which one. This is what Phenix uh, Denver has urban air pollution issues.

615
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:45,090
Dallas and Houston, you know, coming through the Midwest, St. Louis, Chicago.

616
01:15:45,090 --> 01:15:50,040
You know, here's kind of the Detroit area that we sort of fit into here in Ann Arbor and then, you know,

617
01:15:50,040 --> 01:15:58,620
much of the Northeast Corridor from kind of northern Virginia up through kind of the Boston area

618
01:15:58,620 --> 01:16:05,850
and then much of the state of California actually has the worst ozone problems to this day.

619
01:16:05,850 --> 01:16:15,630
We watched that video right there, talked about air pollution, ozone being a primary culprit, going back to the 1950s, 1960s.

620
01:16:15,630 --> 01:16:26,010
And even so, even though there's been significant progress made, we still have problems.

621
01:16:26,010 --> 01:16:28,150
And then just to introduce particulate matter,

622
01:16:28,150 --> 01:16:34,680
and I'll go ahead and pause after this slide and prompt any questions, but to kind of clarify PMAs and mix.

623
01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:38,430
Whereas Ozone is exclusively a secondary pollutant,

624
01:16:38,430 --> 01:16:45,240
meaning that it's entirely formed in the atmosphere from other precursor emissions of different gases.

625
01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:53,540
Four p.m. We have a mix. We do have primary p.m. that is emitted right from a tailpipe.

626
01:16:53,540 --> 01:16:58,800
Here's a diesel truck that's emitting particles right at the source.

627
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:04,710
But there are many secondary particles secondary pollution that's formed from precursor gases.

628
01:17:04,710 --> 01:17:13,440
And the easy example is sulfur dioxide that's emitted from power plants that sulfur dioxide travels downwind.

629
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:22,560
And there are chemical reactions that take place here is that ammonia that we talked about in the agricultural export example,

630
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:35,400
mixing with nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides that actually form these particles secondarily in the atmosphere through atmospheric chemical reactions.

631
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:45,300
I'll go ahead and stop there, or we're pretty much at the end of time. Do you folks have any questions?

632
01:17:45,300 --> 01:17:54,000
All right. Thanks so much for your attention. A reminder I won't be here on Tuesday and I won't actually see you guys until a week from now.

633
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:57,870
If anyone has any questions in the meantime, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.

634
01:17:57,870 --> 01:18:03,860
Shoot me an email or whatever. I'm still around, even though I'm super busy, unfortunately.

635
01:18:03,860 --> 01:18:14,923
Thanks. Have a great day.
