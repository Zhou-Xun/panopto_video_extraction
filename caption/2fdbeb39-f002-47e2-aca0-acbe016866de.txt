1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:11,000
In this example, we're going to look at how to take recordings that we have stored in blue jeans to download them, to preserve them long term.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So I'm going to start by going to umich.bluejeans.com and choose Login.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
You'll want to make sure that has the University of Michigan logo on that log in page.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So make to make sure you're on the you Misch. And not just the standard blue jeans Web site at the very top and the blue bar.

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:47,000
You should have a recording's tab. If you have no recordings, unfortunately, that means the expiration date has been hit for how long?

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Blue jeans will store University of Michigan recordings and they're gone.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Hopefully that's not the case and you still have some that you can save.

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:06,000
So I have one here from my personal meeting. And when I click on this, it's going to take me to where it'll play.

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm in a pause it because I don't want to play it. I actually just want to download it and take it off this platform.

10
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So down below the video player. And it's a little difficult to see, but it's like a piece of paper with an downward downward facing arrow on it.

11
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:32,000
And it says, download when I put my mouse over it. I mean, a click that.

12
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:40,000
And I'm going to take the top option audio, video and presentation, this is going to put everything into just one video.

13
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You're welcome to store all of these just in case for an archive to make sure you have all the pieces you want.

14
00:01:47,000 --> 00:02:01,000
But this is going to combine everything into one MP for. Click this download icon and it's saving it into my downloads folder on my computer.

15
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
So I'm going to close that and I have a second tab open here at the top.

16
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
That takes me to canvas. So if not, you can open a canvas window for yourself.

17
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'm going to scroll into a course.

18
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:27,000
My just my Canvas Basics practice course and so say if this was a recording that I needed to share with a class, this would be one location.

19
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You could share this if I just needed to save it for myself.

20
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I could. I may not need to save it in canvas.

21
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Instead, I could save it in something like Google Drive. So, for instance, I could open a tab and go to drive.umich.edu

22
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:54,000
This is where I save a lot of files for myself. And sometimes I share them with others and sometimes they're just my own notes.

23
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:02,000
But I'm going to use the canvas example in case these are recordings you want to share with a group of students.

24
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
So in the Panopto recordings area of the course.

25
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:14,000
And if this is not enabled, you can go to the settings. Navigation tab.

26
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:25,000
And if it's not in this top list of tools, it will be down in this lower list of tools where you can click the three dots to enable it.

27
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:34,000
If you're enabling the tool, you will need to come all the way down to the bottom of the page and save your changes.

28
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:46,000
In this case, I already have Panopto in my menu, so I'll just click on it.

29
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:54,000
And I'll use this create button right here in the middle of my page and choose upload media.

30
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:01,000
This means I have a video file that I want to share through Panopto.

31
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:08,000
And what I'm going to do is just click right here, and that's going to open up my my file system.

32
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,000
And so for me, my things I download from the Internet, go to downloads.

33
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:25,000
And I know that this is my Panopto recording. It typically will have a chapter one and then it's got to dot MP four at the end.

34
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:33,000
And when I click open, it's going to upload this and so this is going to allow me to save and share these recordings,

35
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I have two different students over time as needed.

36
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I can even click and say. Recording on topic one.

37
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Or you can rename it however you'd like. So when I click the X in the upper right corner, this is going to process.

38
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:01,000
And then once this is done, it's gonna be available for students to view right here from the canvas site.

39
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:14,583
