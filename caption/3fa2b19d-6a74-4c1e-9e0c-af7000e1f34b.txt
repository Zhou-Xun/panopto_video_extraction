1
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:05,460
All right, guys, let's get started. Happy New Year.

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:10,410
Welcome back. How is everybody doing or we're all feeling really excited to be here.

3
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:14,640
I personally don't know if this whole working after Christmas thing is going to work for me.

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:19,860
I don't I don't think it's working out. My son is still on.

5
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:23,610
I don't know why in public schools in the University of Michigan can't like have a conversation.

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,220
They never do. But his school doesn't start until Monday.

7
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:31,620
So I've been like working watching him, like in his pajamas, watching YouTube videos all day long.

8
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,059
So it's not it's not inspiring, I guess, is what I'm saying.

9
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:41,520
It does not feel like we're back to normal anyway. All right, so hope we're on the right room.

10
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:49,049
This is cancer epidemiology. And I thought I would start off by introducing myself and then introducing kind of the

11
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:53,970
class and give you kind of a flavor of what we're going to be talking about this year,

12
00:00:54,180 --> 00:01:03,900
this term. So I Allison model and I thought I'd just give you a little bit of background about how I kind of got here to, to cancer epidemiology.

13
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,020
So I actually did my undergraduate degree at the University of Illinois,

14
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:10,290
which seems to be more upsetting to my Illinois friends than it is to people in Michigan.

15
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:16,910
Like Illinois thinks Michigan's their rival. Michigan's like, what? So when I announced that I was taking this job at a lot of my undergrad friends,

16
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,579
like, Oh my God, I'm like, you don't have a school, but a school of public health.

17
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,960
Like, I'm not I promise I'm not going to play on the football team. I swear I'm not going to have it.

18
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:32,160
It'll be okay. So, yeah, so I did my undergraduate degree at Illinois in microbiology, which if you're in science long enough,

19
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:37,210
they renamed your degree and then you feel super old because they don't have your degree anymore, so they don't have a microbiology degree more.

20
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:42,690
But that's what mine was. And I knew I really like science.

21
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:48,329
Right? But when you talk to the academic, I think at that time it was the nineties and I think they were even I think

22
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:52,890
epidemiology and public health were even less known about at that time as an option.

23
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:57,509
Right. Because I remember talking to one of my academic advisors and I was like, well, I like science.

24
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:00,989
What should I do? And they were like, Well, you can go to med school or you can work in a lab.

25
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:05,370
And I was like, But I don't want to do either of those things.

26
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:09,510
But as previously mentioned, I do like science and they're like, Well, no.

27
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:15,120
So I did sort of a half hearted application to med school and it turns out if you do

28
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:21,149
a half hearted application in med school and you don't really want to be a doctor, you don't get in and which was for the best.

29
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:24,780
So I did work in a lab for two years, killed a lot of rats.

30
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:31,260
There's a special little corner of [INAUDIBLE] for me someday, and I did not enjoy it.

31
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:38,159
I was correct that I did not enjoy working in the lab, so I was casting about trying to figure out what I wanted to do next.

32
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,720
And I found out about MPH programs.

33
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:47,220
I was also considering briefly a master's in forensic science, but it turns out the day to day that is actually not like CSI that, you know.

34
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:53,790
And so I didn't do that. And so I went and got my my Emory.

35
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,850
I was very excited about infectious disease.

36
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:04,530
I had read The Hot Zone, and I was pretty sure that I wanted to, you know, work at the CDC with infectious disease stuff.

37
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,950
But the way my master's program was structured, they made you take a bunch of different types of classes, including a chronic disease class.

38
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:15,690
And I was like, okay, fine, I guess I'll take this cancer AP disease class. And I really loved it, really loved it.

39
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:21,540
So I ended up getting a job at the American Cancer Society after my master's degree.

40
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:25,700
And I worked there for like three years because I wasn't I wasn't sure if I'd really one of the Ph.D.

41
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:29,640
Right. I was like, Oh, no, this is work for a little bit. Take a break, see how it feels.

42
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:35,399
And I really did end up knowing that I wanted to get a Ph.D. because I wanted to be the one who decided what

43
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,139
the questions were we were going to answer rather than kind of executing what somebody else had come up with.

44
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,820
So I ended up going back to school.

45
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:49,080
I got my Ph.D. at Johns Hopkins, and I graduated there in 2009, and then I did a post-doc at the National Cancer Institute,

46
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:53,910
and then I got my job here in 2014, and the rest is history, as they say.

47
00:03:53,940 --> 00:04:01,259
So I am a cancer epidemiologist. I study a lot of modifiable risk factors and cancer.

48
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:04,320
So I'm interested in what kind of modifiable factors cause cancer.

49
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,410
You kind of, as you're going to learn in this class, can't study cancer.

50
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:10,650
That also kind of involving genetics.

51
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:16,470
I'm not a genetic epidemiologist, but you pretty much can't get away from it because cancer is basically a genetic disease.

52
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:22,890
Right. So I have, you know, done some she was work I have done metabolomics work.

53
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:28,380
So some more agnostic approaches. I've also done sort of hypothesis driven biomarker work as well.

54
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:33,180
This used a lot of questionnaire data. My work tends to be a little bit more risk factor focused.

55
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:40,980
So I've studied multiple cancers and these risk factors. If I had to pick a cancer that I studied the most would probably be prostate.

56
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:46,680
I've done a lot of work on prostate, but I've also recently been doing quite a bit of work on how to knock cancer and.

57
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:55,900
I'm also now a co-investigator on my carers, which is this big new study that you all have probably been getting a lot of e-mails about.

58
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:03,040
You're in our age. We do it too. To join and be a part of.

59
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:08,860
So we're recruiting. We got funded to start a brand new cancer cohort in the state of Michigan.

60
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:15,490
So we are recruiting 100,000 Michiganders between the ages of 25 to 44 to study environmental risk factors for cancer.

61
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:20,470
So we're pretty excited about that. So that's a little bit about me.

62
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:27,459
Basically, the core structure is lecture and in-class exercise based.

63
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:33,650
So we're going to be doing a lot of lectures. We're going to post the slides prior to class time if possible.

64
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:37,630
My lectures will be posted. I cannot guarantee that guest.

65
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:42,100
We're going have some guest lectures in the second half and I can't guarantee that those are going to be posted ahead of time.

66
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:45,339
They may not actually even share their slides, right? Sometimes they do.

67
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:45,969
Sometimes they don't.

68
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:51,700
I will ask, but they may choose not to, especially if they have a lot of kind of unpublished data in them or something like that.

69
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:58,540
I know Steve Chen, who is the head and neck surgeon who I mentioned beforehand when people were still trickling in, comes to give the talk.

70
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:02,200
He has surgical photos in his, so he does not share those clearly.

71
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,500
So, you know, when it's a guest lecture,

72
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:12,070
I would encourage you to be more careful about taking notes because you may not have the slides available to you later.

73
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,950
Readings are on canvas.

74
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:20,499
We're going to do some in-class exercises in groups, and then I'm going to talk to you a bit about the grading and the schedule.

75
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,730
So let's hop over to campus.

76
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:32,500
So this is how I have the course, the canvas site structured. Each of these goes to a page where it will have links to the readings, if there are any.

77
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:37,510
The lecture slides. I will post the recordings here afterward.

78
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:43,930
So the recordings, the link to the recording will be on the page for the lecture that it's associated with.

79
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:45,700
Right. And if there are.

80
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:56,320
Like here, there's going to be an in-class exercise, so the link will be there to that and you can always also get to it through the assignments tab.

81
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,680
Let's see what else I think that we're going to have to exams.

82
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:09,460
We'll talk about those a bit more later. I have these highlighted because I'm still nailing down dates for some of these.

83
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:14,950
Some of these are going to be guest speakers. And I haven't gotten firm dates from them yet.

84
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:18,489
So those may switch around. Right. Those whether Harvard and Yale, they will happen,

85
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:21,850
but they may not actually happen on the date that they're that they say they're going to happen there.

86
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:26,140
So that's a little bit in flux. Okay. So let's take a look at the.

87
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:32,080
Syllabus. Do this.

88
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:38,200
So you can see this is just the competencies and goals. I'm not going to read all of that to you.

89
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:42,970
The the grade will be based on two exams, 25% each.

90
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:46,720
There is a project which will be done in groups.

91
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:56,140
You're going to. Be assigned, but also have a you know, you have some input on which one, but you're going to be assigned to cancer.

92
00:07:57,070 --> 00:08:01,840
Your group will provide me I think I think I have like a like a survey set

93
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,540
up where you can tell me like your top three choices or something like that,

94
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:10,869
and we'll work it out, but you'll get a cancer and you're going to basically do kind of a a quick background on it.

95
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:14,829
But you're the main bulk of the presentation on paper is going to be designing a

96
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:19,149
study to address a remaining question in epidemiologic research about that cancer.

97
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:23,020
Right. So you'll have to do some background reading, kind of figure out kind of what the gaps are.

98
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,990
In the science for that cancer. And then you'll design a study to address that gap that that you have identified.

99
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:41,820
Does that make sense? There will be a paper and a presentation and then the in-class exercises, and then you will do a peer review for, I think, to.

100
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:47,819
I don't remember two or three other groups presentation she'll do a peer review for,

101
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:51,330
so you'll have to turn those in in-class exercises that will just be graded on.

102
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:57,270
Did you do it or not? Basically. And that's worth this kind of a participation site grade and that's worth 25% of your grade.

103
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:05,380
Okay. Um. So this is an in-person class.

104
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:10,820
You know, it's not hybrid. We are going to be in-person. I am recording the lectures.

105
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:14,730
If you are sick, don't come listen to the recording.

106
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:18,020
If there was an in-class exercise that day, do it on your own and turn it into me.

107
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:23,090
You know, so that's that's the deal with that. Totally understand.

108
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:31,069
I anticipate that there will be a fair bit of that this term. And we all want to stay healthy and keep everybody else healthy, too.

109
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:35,300
Right. So I totally get that. That's why we're recording them for everybody.

110
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:47,209
Um, I think that's it. I have, um, assigned groups already for the in-class exercises.

111
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:53,810
I've not done it for the. Projects because I anticipate there will be a fair bit of like dropping adding.

112
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:58,340
I know some of you were in here just checking me out, trying to decide to want to take this class.

113
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:01,610
Managing class? I don't know. So see what this lady's like?

114
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:08,780
No, I'm kidding. I know there's a fair bit of like moving around different drop out deadline that's totally expected and understandable.

115
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:10,189
So these groups may change a bit.

116
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:16,220
And that's why I will not assign the groups and, you know, get started on the project until later when things are a little bit more settled.

117
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:21,710
But basically, these are going to be your in class groups. Take a look at that before you come to class.

118
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:30,880
Next time like is the next time it is next time to check out your groups before we come to class on Tuesday so that you can kind of be like one,

119
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,360
two and everybody find each other make sense.

120
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:42,090
Yes. Three similar assignments, one for each group or one for the in-class exercises that will be and for the final project.

121
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,500
Anything in groups it will be one person per group uploads at.

122
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:49,910
And everybody else in the group should be able to see it because it's set up as a group thing.

123
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:55,680
Yes. Yeah. You've got to confirm the classic two things.

124
00:10:55,970 --> 00:11:01,340
That is correct. Not this coming Tuesday, a week from next Tuesday on the 17th.

125
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:06,710
Yes. So I have a meeting, an all day meeting that I need to go to in Flint that day.

126
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:11,500
So get a day off. Ron.

127
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:23,280
Any other questions? If you think of any, we can address them at the end.

128
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:28,200
I'm going to go ahead and give you a little overview of.

129
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:35,540
Kind of cancer, Abby. And what we're going to talk about this.

130
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:40,610
I don't know what that title is back there. That's weird. I apologize. So.

131
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:46,440
One of the things we're going to talk about this this term is and I hope this can be kind of interactive.

132
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:50,130
Right. I know it's like late in the afternoon, everybody's tired. We're all like nap time.

133
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:56,460
I don't know. I'm wondering where my pie and nap is, frankly, right now, because that has been my last two weeks.

134
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:01,679
3:00 was like curl up after a snack and have a nap on the couch with my dog.

135
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:07,919
Like, I don't know what's going on right now, but I hope you'll all, you know, just raise your hands, be interactive.

136
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:12,149
If you have questions, interrupt me and ask them. We don't have to be formal or anything like that.

137
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:17,280
So these are the 2022 estimates from the American Cancer Society.

138
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:22,200
You're going to see these little people in this list many times in this class.

139
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,950
So these are the top one is estimated new cases.

140
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:29,100
So this is cancer incidence on the top separated by men and women.

141
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:33,689
And this is cancer deaths on the bottom, men and women.

142
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:42,269
And so you can see this is the number of expected deaths and this is the proportion of all cancer that that causes.

143
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:47,790
So like 21% of all cancer deaths are due to lung and bronchus, cancer in men, for example.

144
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:51,329
So what do you guys notice here? Does anything stand out to you?

145
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:55,500
Anything surprise you? What do you think about this?

146
00:12:56,670 --> 00:13:05,000
Yeah, but it's surprising how breast cancer prostate cancer can affect females and males.

147
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:12,780
It's like kind of the same number. Yeah, it is. It's like a big chunk of the new cases of each in the male men and the women.

148
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:17,359
You're right. But then they follow that lower end death rate.

149
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,410
They're actually number two for deaths. Yeah.

150
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:30,050
Why do you think that is? Why do you guys think there. They have lower death rates even though there's more cases.

151
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:35,480
Yeah. Is it easier to catch? Yeah, that's part of it.

152
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:39,950
We do have we have screening tests for both breast and prostate cancer.

153
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:43,340
We also have a screening test for lung cancer. It is a bit newer.

154
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:46,760
It's only recommended for people with like a profound smoking history.

155
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:55,700
And I think uptake of that is a little bit less than the screening tests for because it's newer than for prostate in Nebraska.

156
00:13:55,700 --> 00:14:00,920
So they're still kind of working to get heavy smokers to to know that they can do this one CT screening.

157
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:06,130
So, yes, I think that's part of it. When you catch an early treatment, it's more effective.

158
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:09,680
Right. And that's one of the things that's kind of the whole idea behind screening.

159
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,110
Right. And we're going to talk about that in detail a in the lecture,

160
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:18,540
because I think that that the reason why it is higher index is because we're catching it later.

161
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:26,690
Yeah, absolutely. Until recently, like I said, I think it was 2009 maybe or 2006 and I have to look it up.

162
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:34,099
Exactly. But it was the late 2000 when they introduced the lung C.T. but like the trial came out with the lung CT scan results.

163
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:37,399
And so only shortly thereafter did they actually start recommending it.

164
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:41,420
So it's only been like ten years that we've really have cancer screening.

165
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:45,349
And again, it's not like 100% uptake or anything like that.

166
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:50,300
So, yes, lung cancer is one of those that historically and still for a lot of people is caught

167
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:55,070
fairly late because we didn't have an effective screening test until recently.

168
00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:00,770
And unfortunately, by the time you start having symptoms for pretty much any cancer,

169
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:07,400
once you're having noticeable symptoms, you're usually fairly late stage, fairly advanced.

170
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:14,659
Anything else? What else do people notice? Yeah, kind of general.

171
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:21,260
But the two highest for both genders, like of most cases, are also the most deadly.

172
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:28,129
What do you mean? So, like the the most. Like what you're saying, prostate and lung and then lung and prostate.

173
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:33,950
They just flip. But they're both at the top. Yes. Yes. So, like the rate of new cancers are the most deadly cancers.

174
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:40,560
Yes. I guess I mean, it it it makes some sense, too, because it's not it's it's the if 30% of cancers are breast.

175
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:45,350
A good chunk of the cancer death is also going to be. Right. So that that is it's true.

176
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:50,330
Mortality is a result of incidents. Right. You're going to have more mortality due to a disease if it's more common.

177
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:54,799
Yeah. Yeah. That same nerve.

178
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,330
Even though, like pancreatic cancer, the incidence is low.

179
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:03,890
It's just one of those very aggressive cancers. Um, therefore, the mortality rate is higher.

180
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:07,880
Yes, 100%. Pancreatic cancer is unfortunately a fairly nasty one.

181
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:15,440
And we'll look at some of the I may have a slide about it in a few slides, actually, but if you look at like survival, you can go.

182
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:23,120
We're going to learn next time. I think we're going to go actually use the Web site where you can download all these statistics and look at them.

183
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,390
Right. You can actually just go on the web and find this stuff and I'm gonna show you how to do that next time.

184
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:32,000
And you can see, like survival by stage a diagnosis, right, for most of these cancers.

185
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:36,950
Interestingly, another one that people think of as being very deadly is ovarian cancer.

186
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:40,099
And it is right. It is pretty low.

187
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:46,159
I mean, it doesn't even show up in the top ten for incidence, but here it is at number five for death for women.

188
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,670
Right. So that's it's a very aggressive cancer and it is quite deadly.

189
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:53,599
The reason for that is because it is usually caught quite late. Right.

190
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:59,209
Almost all ovarian cancers are sort of like stage four. And survival is very poor at that point.

191
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:01,190
If you look by survival by stage, though,

192
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:06,320
like the five year relative survival rate is like 90 something percent if you catch ovarian cancer at stage one.

193
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:11,960
So if we had it effective screening test for ovarian cancer, we could solve that problem.

194
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:23,059
Weirdly, if you look for pancreas, it's still really, really bad even for stage one, compared to like 50%, 34 and 50%, something like that.

195
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:30,920
So like shockingly bad even for stage one. So there's something kind of inherent about pancreatic cancer that is aggressive even if caught early.

196
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:36,220
So a screening test for pancreatic cancer might not actually be. The whole answer.

197
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:41,530
So it's one of the themes that you're going to see in this class is that cancer isn't one disease.

198
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:45,950
We talk about cancer as if it's one thing. Every cancer is a separate disease.

199
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:51,340
And even within cancer site, there are distinct differences.

200
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:56,470
There are distinct subtypes of molecular subtypes, for example, that are actually distinct diseases.

201
00:17:56,890 --> 00:18:00,940
Does anybody know of a cancer that's like that offhand?

202
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:06,710
The breast. Breast? Absolutely, yeah. So there is.

203
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:10,190
But PR, PR and her two markers.

204
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:18,979
And if you have of your positive, these are like molecular markers that they can test for like receptors in the tissue.

205
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:24,740
Right. So if you have a breast tumor, you can look at whether the cells have these receptors for estrogen and progesterone and her two.

206
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:32,150
And if they have and PR, they actually are kind of inherently less aggressive tumors than if they don't.

207
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:37,760
Right. Kind of the worse prognosis, tumors are triple negative tumors that have none of those receptors.

208
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:42,429
Part of the reason there is inherently more aggressive and we don't have any

209
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:47,260
targeted therapies because there are therapies that target those receptors. And if you don't have any of those, there's nothing to target.

210
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:52,269
So those are but they're very different. Like the risk factors are very different.

211
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:56,050
There are different subsets of ovarian cancer that have different risk factors.

212
00:18:56,260 --> 00:19:02,620
Right. So there's it's very interesting, actually, that there are really we've we're keep narrowing that, right.

213
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:08,410
We're like cancer. We're actually all the cancers are different. And how different causes actually, even within cancer site,

214
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:16,060
there's different cancers now that we can look at the tissue and tell anything else that people are excited about here.

215
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:24,860
Or interested. I think it's interesting that. Everybody kind of knows, like prostate, lung, colon, breast, lung, colon.

216
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:30,790
They kind of know about those. The fourth ones down suddenly seem to be like new information to most people.

217
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:35,600
Right? It's like we don't hear about them. Bladder cancer is number four for men.

218
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:40,640
Anybody know? It's like the number one risk factor for bladder cancer is in the U.S.

219
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:50,430
Smoking. Good guess. Smoking. That's a good guess for pretty much any cancer, by the way, if you're like, what's a risk factor for this cancer?

220
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:54,750
Smoking, you're almost always right.

221
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:58,020
There actually is one cancer which smoking is protective.

222
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,000
And it's uterine cancer. We don't say protective.

223
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:07,220
We say there's an inverse association we don't like. This is the dirty secret of cancer.

224
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:15,110
We don't like to say protective. There's an inverse association between cigaret smoking and risk of uterine cancer, oddly.

225
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:19,430
But yeah. And that's number four for women and increasing. Right.

226
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:23,060
And so these are these are kind of the next next ones down. But most people do.

227
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:25,010
We hear a lot about the really deadly ones.

228
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:31,610
We hear a lot about pancreas and ovarian, I think, because they're kind of scary and we know that they're deadly.

229
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,330
We hear a lot about the top three because they're common and are screening tests for them.

230
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:40,970
Hear a lot less about these next ones down. I think that's interesting. Okay.

231
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:49,940
So we also, I think, often think of cancer as being sort of a U.S. or a developed country problem.

232
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:55,880
Right. And I think up until now, it kind of has been mostly right.

233
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:59,750
But cancer rates are really increasing in an alarming rate globally,

234
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:05,660
and they're really expected to increase dramatically in developing countries over time.

235
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:13,790
Right. And that's because even if you these countries are going through the epidemiologic transition.

236
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:16,520
Right. We've not heard about that in some of our other classes, probably,

237
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:22,160
where whereas a country goes through these stages of economic development, often the age structure changes.

238
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:29,240
Right. And as you kind of get a handle on infectious causes of disease and things that tend to kill people when they're younger,

239
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:33,500
they tend to live into older age. And then suddenly diseases of older age are a problem.

240
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,740
And what is the number one risk factor for cancer is age.

241
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:41,400
Right. If you just quit getting older, you'd be all set.

242
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:44,470
Can you guys just stop doing that? Right.

243
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,390
So that is the number one risk factor right now. We're going to learn about why that is.

244
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:53,030
It's sort of an obvious reason, I suppose, but, you know, age is the number one risk factor.

245
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:57,830
So aside from anything else changing in these countries, as the populations age, they're going to have more cancer.

246
00:21:57,890 --> 00:22:02,870
Right. There's also the issue of risk factor profiles changing.

247
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:09,080
Right. As these countries go through economic those stages of economic development, there's going to be increasing obesity.

248
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:13,250
There's going to be differences in diet there. There's going to be people are going to have more money to spend on cigarets.

249
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:18,410
We've had smoking decreasing in this country for a very long time.

250
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:23,420
Right. We're kind of plateauing out at about 20% of the population smoking now, which is great.

251
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:31,290
Except do you think that the Philip morris executives are going to be cautious about making as much money as so soon?

252
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,890
No, they're going to make money other places.

253
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:41,040
They're taking their business to countries that suddenly have more disposable income and no tobacco control laws on the books like

254
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:48,700
we do in the U.S. they're more than happy to go sell their cigarets in Africa and Mexico and Eastern Europe and everywhere else.

255
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:55,230
Right. So there's plenty of that happening. Those kinds of things are changing as these countries move through phases of filament.

256
00:22:56,220 --> 00:23:00,090
So in the U.S., just a few numbers. These are based on the 2022 estimates.

257
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:12,450
There's about 1.9 million new cases anticipated. That's about 5250 a day, about 600,000 deaths, but 1668 per day.

258
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:17,460
A large majority are in people 55 and older, so about 75% of cases occur in older people.

259
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:21,720
The five year relative survival rate for all cancers has increased.

260
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:26,100
It's 68%, up from 49% in the seventies.

261
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:35,140
Do you guys know what I mean by the five year relative survival rate? It means that five years after diagnosis,

262
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:41,380
what is the survival rate for people diagnosed without cancer compared to what you would expect for other people their age, essentially?

263
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:48,370
Right. Because the survival rate for somebody in their eighties, would it be expected to be lower than somebody in their sixties?

264
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:52,730
Right. So you don't kind of just there's a little more math to it than just calculate the percent of people who survive.

265
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:57,790
Right. But we're doing better. Not as well as some other diseases.

266
00:23:57,790 --> 00:24:01,000
Right. Like cardiovascular disease has really made huge improvements.

267
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:06,940
There has been some drugs and some procedures that have really just made everything much, much better.

268
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:12,340
And huge improvements in cardiovascular disease survival. Cancer remains a bit of a slog.

269
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:21,140
We're still working on it. The lifetime probability of developing cancer is actually higher for men than for women.

270
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:26,660
And there's about 18.1 million cancer survivors in the US in 2020.

271
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:31,130
So. Cancer survivorship. Tertiary prevention.

272
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:38,540
Quality of life after cancer treatment. Financial toxicity due to the cancer treatment.

273
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:42,440
These are things we're not going to talk about in a lot of detail in this class,

274
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:50,420
but they're becoming really important aspects of cancer epidemiology of the public health spectrum of cancer.

275
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:55,249
Right. Because it used to be kind of it was cancer was a death sentence.

276
00:24:55,250 --> 00:25:00,590
Right. It was all hands on deck. You just kind of have to keep these people alive. Now we're doing a pretty good job.

277
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:03,680
Like, oh, well, some people will die.

278
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:07,340
That's. Oh, no. Oh, it turns out there's other stuff we have to worry about now.

279
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:15,740
Right. So, you know, the shift in some of the research has shifted more toward that and trying to figure out how to improve those kinds of things.

280
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:24,110
And then if you're an HIV oriented kind of person, if you like those classes, you'll find this slide very interesting.

281
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:30,919
Cancer is incredibly costly to treat. The cost of care at cancer care in 2019 was $21 billion.

282
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:36,889
According to the NCI, the national out-of-pocket costs were the highest for breast cancer.

283
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:40,730
Prostate, colon, lung, obviously, because there are the most cases of those.

284
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:48,140
Right. And then, of course, there's the intangible and psychosocial costs of pain and suffering and grief.

285
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:53,950
Right. And these are not only felt by the patients themselves, but by their caregivers, their families.

286
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:58,450
Right. So we think of cancer as being very common.

287
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:04,830
Most of us probably know someone who's had cancer or has had a relative or a family member or somebody that we know might be diagnosed with cancer.

288
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:12,080
I can think of a whole bunch of people off the top of my head. It actually is mathematically a rare disease, right?

289
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:16,190
Fewer than if you actually you know, when we're talking about odds ratios,

290
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:21,620
perhaps like estimating the relative risk, cancer is a pretty good disease for that.

291
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:27,379
And in terms of some of the study design stuff that we're going to talk about, how you do studies for cancer, it is fairly rare.

292
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:34,100
You need big, big cohorts. Right. Cardiovascular disease cohorts need ten, 20,000 people.

293
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:37,680
Cancer cohorts need 50 to 100000 people. Right.

294
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:43,460
To get enough cases to really be able to look at much. So it is that kind of thing.

295
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:51,440
Yeah. So in part because cancer is divided into so many subcategories, you have to study them separately because cancer itself seems common.

296
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,710
But like, say ovarian cancer, it gets a lot.

297
00:26:55,340 --> 00:27:01,580
Yeah, I mean, that's part of it. But even like overall cancer is less common than cardiovascular.

298
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:06,000
Well. The lifetime risk is a little bit lower.

299
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:11,060
I would say. But yes, part of it is because you do have to split it up into the individual.

300
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:16,130
You can't really look at cancer as one thing. Right. And especially if you want to look at some of these rarer cancers.

301
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:21,080
You need more people, for sure. All right.

302
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:25,450
So risk factors for cancer. We're going to have a bunch of lectures about these.

303
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:28,630
These are very common and they're shared with other chronic diseases.

304
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:33,940
Smoking and obesity always kind of get the top billing, but there's some other ones.

305
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:41,590
I would also argue that physical activity and diet and dietary supplements, these should be sort of grouped with obesity.

306
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:49,480
We're going to have a lecture on obesity that I hope will be a little bit more holistic and talk a bit more about kind of.

307
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:54,270
All of the things, you know, we talk about obesity as if.

308
00:27:55,680 --> 00:28:00,329
Being fat, having more body fat is the thing that increases your risk of disease,

309
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:03,750
and it may there are some biologic mechanisms to that that make some sense.

310
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:08,890
But if you believe that, that is the problem. What's the fix?

311
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:13,479
Losing weight. How many people are.

312
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:19,710
Especially people who are. Quite larger are successful at that in the long term.

313
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:29,280
Do we have any evidence based recommendations that we can give to people that are successful in helping people lose and keep weight off long term?

314
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:34,070
No, we don't. Right. We can't do that.

315
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:43,680
And so kind of our our I think our model so far as public health professionals and as medical practitioners, you know,

316
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:48,920
our our friends across the street is mostly to tell people that they're too fat and they should lose weight.

317
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:53,690
And there's a lot of shame in that. Right. And like, you're not doing something right.

318
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:58,250
You should lose weight. Except they can't tell anybody how to do that successfully.

319
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:04,340
So if you can't actually provide somebody with a successful intervention for something you think is a problem.

320
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:08,140
Is that. What else can we do about it?

321
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:13,509
Right. And so I have a lecture that I will give that kind of addresses what I think some of

322
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:17,409
the other things that can be contributing to the health risks associated with obesity,

323
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:19,840
people avoiding medical care because of a shame,

324
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:25,390
practitioners not providing the same medical care to obese patients that they're providing to other people.

325
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:30,430
Stigmatization that can cause. You know,

326
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:34,899
we there's a lot of research that shows stigma experienced on the basis of racial

327
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:39,130
discrimination can have biologic effects that are very negative for your health.

328
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:45,340
I suspect that even though there's been a lot less research on it, weight based stigma can have the same results, right?

329
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:51,310
Quality of diet, lack of physical activity are wrapped into that.

330
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:58,030
Maybe a better intervention would be to tell somebody who's overweight, go to the gym, find an activity that you like and do it.

331
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:04,620
It's good for you. The goal not being losing weight. The goal being to have a physically active lifestyle that is better for your health.

332
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:04,960
Right.

333
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:12,429
I think we're moving towards some of this in our society, but it's still one of the few things that make people go to the doctor and ashamed about.

334
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:17,290
Right. The doctor can't tell them what to do about it. I find it shocking.

335
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,930
So I have a whole lecture about that. I'll get off my soapbox now.

336
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:26,429
Menopausal hormone therapy. There's been a big shift in that.

337
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:31,060
That has implications for cancer risk, NSAIDs and other common medications.

338
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:34,320
Some of my own work is on statin drugs and risk of cancer.

339
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:40,470
So statins are drugs that are prescribed for cholesterol lowering and actually those are associated with a lower risk of cancer as well.

340
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:47,129
A big thing that a lot of people aren't aware of, some are people who are interested in infectious disease,

341
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:51,960
are usually workers, but not everybody is aware that there's a huge chunk of cancer that's caused by infectious causes.

342
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:55,650
If you think of like a big one. Right on.

343
00:30:56,280 --> 00:31:00,840
So that's actually that is true. Radon is a risk factor, but that's not infectious.

344
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,890
Oh, I guess that radon is actually a radioactive gas.

345
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:11,130
Yeah, yeah, yeah. But that is that is true. That is a cause. And we haven't in Michigan antibodies ever.

346
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:15,420
Probably most of you have not tried to buy a house in Michigan, but if you had, you're going to have to pay for a radon test.

347
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,979
Yeah. So HPV and cervical cancer.

348
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:23,850
Absolutely. Like HIV, AIDS and lymphoma. Yes.

349
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:27,870
We're going to talk about both of those. But kind of the number one with the bullet, you're right, is HPV and cervical cancer, right?

350
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:34,380
It is like a necessary cause of cervical cancer is one of the high risk to having being infected with one of the high risk types of HPV.

351
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:41,219
So that is absolutely number one, liver cancer, hepatitis and liver cancer, is that you're going to say, yeah, I stole it.

352
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:45,690
I'm sorry, it's primary. Yeah, it's pylori and stomach cancer.

353
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:50,220
So that's a bacterial one. The other ones we've mentioned have been viral, but that is actually a bacterial one.

354
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:58,250
And there's actually some parasitic infections, too. I said in the U.S., the number one risk factor for bladder cancer is smoking.

355
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:02,570
But in some parts of the world, Middle East and some parts of Africa. Schistosomiasis.

356
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:09,770
So infection with a parasite is actually a huge risk factor for bladder cancer.

357
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:16,420
So we're going to have a lecture about that. So if you like infectious disease, there's a little tidbit for you here, too.

358
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:21,820
And of course, Gene's right, cancer is a genetic disease.

359
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:26,629
So we're definitely going to have a couple of lectures on cancer biology and hereditary syndromes.

360
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:29,690
Right. These these very strong genetic associations.

361
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:36,170
I think we've all heard of some of them. Can anybody think of one off the top of their head, basically Alzheimer's?

362
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:41,120
That is true for Alzheimer's, yes. Do anybody know one for cancer?

363
00:32:42,930 --> 00:32:46,350
Yeah. Mutation in the refugees in breast cancer.

364
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:50,880
Yep. BRCA1 and two. And breast and ovarian cancers. Right. And there's others as well.

365
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:54,570
Does somebody have a different one that they wanted to mention? Dizziness. Lynch syndrome.

366
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:59,670
Lynch syndrome. Absolutely. So Lynch syndrome is a mutation in mismatch repair genes.

367
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:05,729
There's like a bazillion of them. And so they're like MSH one and LH two, and they all have like the same three letters and like different numbers.

368
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:07,080
So I don't ever remember what they are.

369
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:12,930
That's what books are for, is remembering that books will remember that for you, and then you can go look it up.

370
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:19,950
But yeah, so they're all mismatch repair genes and they cause colon cancer and in some cases individual cancer women.

371
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:29,579
Yeah, me from Amy is another big one. So we're going to talk about some of those, those heavy hitter familial syndromes and then race.

372
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:33,330
And I put a question mark here because. What does race mean?

373
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:39,790
Right. If I tell you that one racial group has a higher or lower risk for cancer.

374
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:44,730
What does that mean? Does that mean it's a genetic difference? Could be.

375
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:50,580
In some cases it is. Asian men have a lower risk of prostate cancer.

376
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:54,870
They have actually a different antigen receptor gene. Thing going on.

377
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,090
Right. So there's actually like a genetic reason for that.

378
00:33:57,420 --> 00:34:02,430
But mostly, I think when we talk about racial disparities in cancer, which will come up a fair bit of this class,

379
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:06,360
we're going to be talking a lot about black white racial disparities in the US.

380
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:14,129
And black people generally have a higher risk of cancer, and if not a higher incidence, then definitely a higher fatality rate for cancer.

381
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:18,640
And that's not genetic generally. In fact, I published recently published a paper.

382
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:23,940
When I get to my prostate cancer lecture, I'll talk about it where we look at risk profiles from enhance.

383
00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:26,610
So there's all these risk factors that have been associated with prostate cancer.

384
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:31,200
Black men have a higher risk of prostate cancer 2 to 3 times higher risk of incidence and mortality.

385
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:35,520
And so a lot of people have said over time, it's probably like, you know,

386
00:34:35,910 --> 00:34:40,350
all of these risk factors that we have, all these kind of lifestyle factors, they all contribute a little bit.

387
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:47,819
And if they're higher in this have in this group, if like black men have a little bit worse profile and all of these risk factors, it just adds up.

388
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:48,120
Right.

389
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:56,070
Well, we looked and in fact, black men had a better risk profile in in Heinz for most of the risk factors than white men and still have a higher risk.

390
00:34:57,050 --> 00:35:02,220
And it's not genetic. They've looked at that. So this is where our social Abby friends come in.

391
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:06,639
Right. It's all of these other. Neighborhood.

392
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:11,290
Social position. Structural racism. Access to care.

393
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:17,770
Potentially like intersections with structural racism in lower socioeconomic socioeconomic

394
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:22,030
status and lower access to care or just generally lots of different things.

395
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:31,120
So that's something that will come up. And I always put a question mark inside it because I think it's very easy to note that there are disparities.

396
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:38,680
Is very difficult to figure out what those disparities mean and what the actionable thing is.

397
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:42,370
You can say there is a disparity, but then what do you do about it?

398
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:49,550
Right. So I think it's a it's race is a construct that has a lot of pieces to it.

399
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:54,470
And, of course, number one with the bullet is age, but we can't do anything about that. So we adjust for it.

400
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:01,820
Anything on this list that surprises you? Each have a question about.

401
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:10,319
Okay. So some of these things are preventable and some are not.

402
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:16,400
Right. We're going to be talking about that. I always think it's interesting to think about the history of cancer just a little bit.

403
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:22,740
We think of it as a modern thing. But the oldest description of cancer is from 3000 B.C. in Egypt.

404
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:27,130
Right. So so it's been with us. Forever.

405
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:32,220
In fact, the word cancer comes from the Greek physician hypocrisies.

406
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:39,490
In this era, ABC using the terms carcinomas and carcinoma to describe an ulcer, forming an ulcer, forming tumors.

407
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:44,650
It means crab because if you see a medicine, a metastasized mass,

408
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:49,480
like if you actually opened a person who died of the metastasized mass, it has kind of these fingers.

409
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:59,460
Right. Looks like a crab. So Galen, when 130 to 200 A.D. used almost instead, which means swelling.

410
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:03,000
So that's where we get like oncology oncologist.

411
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:09,390
So there's this long history, right? In the Renaissance. We started using the scientific method.

412
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:15,720
Harvey in 1628 started looking at cancer from autopsies, realized it had something to do with circulation.

413
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:26,550
This guy, Giovanni Morgan. Morgan me performed autopsies to relate illness to pathologic findings after death in the 1700s.

414
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:33,930
John Hunter in the 1700s suggested that some cancers could be cured by surgery, particularly those that hadn't invaded other tissues.

415
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:38,310
What is the first thing we still do for early stage cancers?

416
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:42,130
First line of treatment. So cut it out.

417
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:46,740
Right. And that's why we try to find. I mean, we're still doing it. It's from the 1700s.

418
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:50,160
And that's still the first thing we do. We try to catch it early when it hasn't spread and cut it out.

419
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:56,160
I think that's fascinating. One of the first ones that they were doing was radical mastectomy.

420
00:37:56,910 --> 00:38:01,379
Right. Because I think it's a little bit. Certainly there could be complications.

421
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:07,500
Right. But it's not like opening up the abdomen or the lungs or something and trying to do surgery on internal organs.

422
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:10,830
It's a little bit simpler if you're just starting out with the whole surgery thing.

423
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:20,420
In the 19th century, Virchow correlated microscopic pathology to illness, so that started the modern pathologic study of cancer.

424
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:25,430
This is one of the things that we're going to talk about. How do we decide someone has cancer?

425
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:34,890
How does it get diagnosed? Anybody know? Yeah.

426
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:42,209
Whether it's malignant or whether it spreads. That's the how.

427
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:46,430
Like, if you. But how would we diagnose it? Like you go to the doctor.

428
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:50,420
And you're like, somebody says, I'm having symptoms.

429
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:58,820
And they they try to figure out if you have cancer or what, but they do a biopsy, the tumor, look at some type of fluid under a microscope.

430
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:02,720
That's exactly right. They're going to look at cells under a microscope. Right.

431
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:09,830
And then a pathologist, hopefully a highly trained one, is going to look at those cells and say, oh, that's cancer.

432
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:14,780
I look at those. They're manageable. Honestly, pathology trained pathologists are amazing.

433
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:18,940
I look at and I'm like that. Is purple. It is.

434
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:24,679
It's really there's little circles and they're purple. And they can tell you this this is this kind of tissue.

435
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:27,739
It's that kind of tissue. This is normal breast. This is lactating breast.

436
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:33,920
This is I mean, it's amazing, right? So but that's still how we determine that someone truly has cancer.

437
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:38,149
You take a sample of it and someone looks at it under a microscope and says, Yup, that's cancer.

438
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:41,510
And then they decide what stage it is, what grade it is.

439
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:46,730
So when you someday as an epidemiologist get a data set that says cancer.

440
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:58,750
Stage two, grade four. It's not like some magical test that they did to determine that somebody sat there and decided they put it in a box.

441
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:04,230
It's a it's a continuous process. And somebody just decided what box?

442
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:09,760
And I think this one goes here. Right. So a highly trained pathologist will be very, very good at that.

443
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:14,710
They'll give you the same answer if they were asked to. They would give you the same answer over and over again.

444
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:15,580
Right.

445
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:22,050
So that's why in our methods section, probably like all the early, highly trained genitourinary pathologists looked at our prostate cancer sample.

446
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:28,570
You know, you kind of say how it was, how all of the stuff was determined, but that's how they do it still.

447
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:34,730
And they started it in the 19th century. But am I doing so I'm going backwards.

448
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:38,970
That's not right. So there's always old theories, right? Some of them you like.

449
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:45,600
Well, that was crazy. And other ones, you're like, that's actually pretty smart that they came up with that at that time.

450
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:51,640
So they used to think it was an excess of black bile. Which isn't even a thing.

451
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:56,680
You don't have any of it, let alone an excess of it. So I'm not really sure where that one came from.

452
00:40:56,680 --> 00:41:00,880
So that was a No. 1650 infectious disease theory.

453
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:04,990
And they thought it might be contagious because there are familial associations.

454
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,300
So it's actually really smart, right?

455
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:15,160
Because some of them are caused by infectious diseases and the fact that they're familiarly associated is actually genetic in a lot of cases.

456
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:22,150
Right. But it was pretty that's a pretty cool observation. They have this limp theory that's not real.

457
00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:26,860
Then they had this blast theory. Okay, cancer is made up of cells, not lump.

458
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:30,310
Yes. Good job, Your Highness Mueller. Yes, that is correct.

459
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:39,790
I don't know about this blast type of thing, but there certainly is an element of the tumor microenvironment that we're not talking about.

460
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:47,380
Right. It's not just the cells themselves, but what's around it that is actually contributing to cancer.

461
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:55,360
So this is a whole area of study. And then Mueller student determined that all cells, including cancer cells, are derived from other cells.

462
00:41:55,540 --> 00:42:02,890
So that's pretty cool. In 1850, they have this chronic irritation theory that cancers metastasize to the spread of malignant cells.

463
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:08,830
All true. Right. And there's some really cool observations, too.

464
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:13,810
So. Mm hmm. The Italian arms are getting me today, guys from a ZENI,

465
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:21,790
an Italian doctor reported in 1713 the virtual absence of cervical cancer and relatively high incidence of breast cancer in nuns.

466
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:27,740
Can anybody explain that one to me? Pronouncing HPV?

467
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:33,409
Yeah, well, HPV is a sexually transmitted disease. So presuming that the nuns are doing nuns, they're supposed to do.

468
00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:36,620
Yes, they're not getting HPV. So that's why they don't have the cervical cancer.

469
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:40,340
What's going up with breast cancer? You know, having kids.

470
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:47,000
Yes. Yes. So knowledge parity or not having children is actually associated with a higher risk of breast cancer.

471
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:54,620
Having more pregnancies and having your first pregnancy. The younger age actually is protective for breast cancer.

472
00:42:55,610 --> 00:43:02,930
And that is part of the reason as countries become more developed, women start being more educated,

473
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:07,070
using birth control, delaying pregnancy, having fewer pregnancies.

474
00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:11,120
All of that is kind of associated with that epidemiologic transition.

475
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:19,280
Breast cancer goes up. Not that we should not have those things for women in order to stop breast cancer,

476
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:23,600
but that is part of why breast cancer rates tend to go up in more developed countries.

477
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:31,060
How about this next one personal plot in London described in 1775, an occupational cancer in chimney sweep,

478
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:36,080
cancer under the cancer of the scrotum caused by soot collecting under their scrotum.

479
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:45,750
Has anybody ever. Yes. Is this the case where they're like basically the Chinese are just like take off all their clothes,

480
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:49,080
like they weren't like wearing protective anything.

481
00:43:49,410 --> 00:43:53,580
I don't know if they took off their clothes, but they sure weren't wearing any protective of anything. And sometimes they were really young.

482
00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:59,950
Right. Like, cause you have to be. I don't know how big those chimneys were, but I bet they weren't like grown man size big.

483
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:03,900
I think a lot of times the chimney sweeps for like adolescence, like young, younger kids.

484
00:44:04,930 --> 00:44:11,570
And I don't think. I have been led to believe that bathing was less of a thing in 1700s London.

485
00:44:11,810 --> 00:44:15,110
Particularly if you were of the social class to be doing a lot of chimney sweeping.

486
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:24,920
Right. So I think it just got there and stayed there. But this is an example we've learned a lot from occupational epidemiology, right?

487
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:29,520
Because is anybody ever heard of cancer of the scrotum? Now.

488
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:37,889
That's weird. That's a weird cancer. And when you start seeing weird cancers in an occupational population because like,

489
00:44:37,890 --> 00:44:41,590
who gets soot on their scrotum under normal circumstances, you don't.

490
00:44:41,610 --> 00:44:45,930
Right. It turns out that, like, the product of combustion has a lot of carcinogens in it.

491
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:49,830
And when you get it on that thin skinned area, it can actually cause cancer there.

492
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:56,099
Right. So when you start to see weird cancers in a population that is like strongly exposed to something in

493
00:44:56,100 --> 00:45:00,600
kind of a weird way because they're occupationally exposed like that is a canary in the coal mine,

494
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:03,780
so to speak, for something going on.

495
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:12,330
And then we start to look in the in the general population. Right. So what if people exposed to in lower amounts by inhaling it, for example?

496
00:45:12,570 --> 00:45:16,500
Is that bad? Yes. It turns out, yes, it is.

497
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:20,070
So that's how we get to some of these things, right?

498
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:29,459
You can the occupational exposures tend to be very high level exposures, sometimes in odd ways that lead to very unusual cancers.

499
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:34,350
And that raises red flags all over the place. Right. All right.

500
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:39,960
How about this? Thomas Venner of London was one of the first to warn about tobacco dangers.

501
00:45:41,010 --> 00:45:47,560
In 1620. I think we knew that it wasn't great.

502
00:45:48,010 --> 00:45:53,920
You know, he wrote that in moderate use of tobacco hurts the brain in the eye and induces trembling of the limbs in the heart.

503
00:45:54,910 --> 00:46:00,700
And 150 years later, in 1761, after recreational tobacco became popular in London,

504
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:05,530
John Hill wrote a book entitled Cautions Against the Immoderate Use of Snuff.

505
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:13,120
So many years later, in the 1950s and sixties, there were these seminal studies that actually show that smoking causes lung cancer.

506
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:18,310
And the first U.S. surgeon general's report on smoking and health came out in 1964.

507
00:46:20,350 --> 00:46:26,760
But I don't think anybody thought it was great for you even before that. Lung cancer used to be very, very rare.

508
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:35,130
We're going to see some. Over time, some time trends for lung cancer that are they're shocking.

509
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:39,700
It used to be vanishingly rare. And now it's the number one cancer.

510
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:46,070
All right. Anybody read this book or seen this on PBS?

511
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:56,760
With all of your free time. You know, if you'd like to spend doing more school related things, you could read this or watch this on TV.

512
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:03,990
It's actually really good. It's kind of a more layperson's point of view, but it's actually really kind of cool.

513
00:47:04,890 --> 00:47:08,110
So. All right.

514
00:47:08,110 --> 00:47:11,890
So we saw this before with the risk factor slide, but this is putting it kind of in more of a.

515
00:47:13,930 --> 00:47:21,640
Population attributable risk. Kind of framework. Right. So 30% of cancer is caused by tobacco, 30% by adult diet and obesity.

516
00:47:21,910 --> 00:47:32,350
And then these other little slices of the pie. Radiation pollution, reproductive factors, infectious agents, family history, occupation, etc.

517
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:42,600
I also really like this. This looks crazy and it's hard to see here, but if you look it up, it's from Cancer Research UK.

518
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:48,930
It's really kind of neat because the idea here is that. So the the full line is like all cancers.

519
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:52,460
Right. The big one are those that are preventable.

520
00:47:53,090 --> 00:47:57,680
And the Pinker and women and the blue are in men. Right. So this is bowel cancer or colon cancer.

521
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:01,810
And then it shows you kind of which risk factors are contributing to that cancer.

522
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:05,210
So it's a much more nuanced version really of like this.

523
00:48:05,330 --> 00:48:10,940
Right. So lung cancer, for example, is almost like tobacco is enormous.

524
00:48:10,940 --> 00:48:15,600
Right. And they're almost all preventable. And then there's these other things, right?

525
00:48:18,370 --> 00:48:21,669
Malignant melanoma. It's entirely sunlight and sunbeds.

526
00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:25,770
Right? So it's sun exposure and it's almost it's very largely preventable.

527
00:48:26,830 --> 00:48:31,390
Breast cancer is almost entirely in women. The preventable fraction is basically all in women.

528
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:39,790
There's a tiny, tiny number over here. I think there's a little tiny blue right there because there is such a thing as male breast cancer.

529
00:48:39,790 --> 00:48:46,540
It's incredibly rare and it is usually in like men who have BRCA1 or two mutations or other genetic mutations.

530
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:50,230
It's usually a fairly genetically driven disease. And then.

531
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:55,889
But I don't know. I thought this was and this is kind of overall for all cancers together.

532
00:48:55,890 --> 00:48:59,160
This is the proportion due to each of these kinds of things.

533
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:04,380
So I like this one. It's a little bit more nuanced, and I think it's kind of fun to look at.

534
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:11,920
I don't know who came up. I always think things like this are cool because I don't think I could ever have come up with this picture.

535
00:49:12,490 --> 00:49:16,479
Like if I were writing a paper and they were like, visualize for every bit.

536
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:18,300
Like who came up with that? That's such a skill.

537
00:49:18,310 --> 00:49:23,770
Like, that's a really cool thing to be able to do is to take this and make it into this really neat visual form.

538
00:49:23,770 --> 00:49:29,499
I think that's really I find that very impressive personally because I've sat down to write many a paper and make many a poster and I'm like,

539
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:37,500
Hmm, I can make a table. I could write a lot of numbers, but that's not my forte.

540
00:49:37,510 --> 00:49:42,220
So I'm impressed by people who are good at. Okay.

541
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:48,230
We're also gonna talk about this. This giant.

542
00:49:50,630 --> 00:49:55,910
What's the word I want to use? Controversy.

543
00:49:57,250 --> 00:50:01,360
Major fight that happened in the literature. People getting very angry.

544
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:05,850
Huge kerfuffle. Kerfuffle.

545
00:50:05,850 --> 00:50:08,909
That's a good word. It was a big kerfuffle in in science.

546
00:50:08,910 --> 00:50:17,130
So we're going to learn about. We talked about all these major cancer hereditary syndromes.

547
00:50:17,970 --> 00:50:25,560
Live from any syndrome is a big one. And that is when you have a defective P53, which is a major cancer related gene.

548
00:50:26,340 --> 00:50:31,410
And Burt VOGELSTEIN discovered p53. So he's a very big deal.

549
00:50:32,810 --> 00:50:36,410
And this came out in science in 2015,

550
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:45,529
and it included this little statement that basically only a third of the variation in cancer risk on tissues is attributable environmental factors.

551
00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:53,510
The majority is due to bad luck. So this abstract came out in science and said that the majority of cancer was due to bad luck.

552
00:50:54,110 --> 00:51:01,070
We're going to talk about this in a much more nuanced way. It is not, I would argue it is not mostly due to bad luck.

553
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:08,900
But you can see that all of the cancer epidemic, if you were like in charge of the ticker on CNN,

554
00:51:09,410 --> 00:51:14,720
what would you pick out of this abstract to put in big letters on the TV screen when you reported on this?

555
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:18,560
Because things that get published in science definitely get a press release.

556
00:51:19,470 --> 00:51:23,100
So this got a press release. And what line do you think they picked?

557
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:30,020
Majority of cancer is bad luck, right? And we're all like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

558
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:33,890
We just got them to quit smoking. Please stop. Don't say that.

559
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:38,150
Don't make it. At least don't make it bold. Can we just put it in read like something?

560
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:42,379
So there are a bunch of like back and forth articles, right?

561
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:46,160
Then this article came out arguing against it and then they kind of doubled down and came out with another article.

562
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:52,790
So we're going to have a whole day where we talk about sort of this, these bad luck papers and all of this back and forth that happened.

563
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:59,749
So I'll bring popcorn for that day. We're also going to talk about genetic susceptibility, right?

564
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:03,740
I mentioned we're going to talk about these hereditary cancers. So if you if you look here,

565
00:52:04,430 --> 00:52:09,530
the idea here is that you have as exposure to environmental exposures or lifestyle exposures

566
00:52:09,530 --> 00:52:14,750
or whatever it non-genetic exposures increases your cancer risk increases to right.

567
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:22,590
And if the general population is kind of on this line. There are these variations in risk, right?

568
00:52:22,710 --> 00:52:28,670
So there are people who are a little bit more susceptible. And so it takes less exposure for those people to get cancer.

569
00:52:28,670 --> 00:52:34,160
So their genetic background, all of these risk factors that going to talk about are playing on your genetic background.

570
00:52:34,430 --> 00:52:40,070
They're playing on everybody's genetic background. So if you imagine that there's some sort of like some sort of baseline normal,

571
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:44,690
there are some people who are more susceptible or more resistant to those kinds of exposures.

572
00:52:45,860 --> 00:52:50,060
Then there's these hereditary syndromes which are really kind of their own thing, right?

573
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:57,170
The role of environmental exposures is very minimal there because they already come here with a hit and a major cancer related gene.

574
00:52:57,740 --> 00:53:03,649
And so it's really like the lifetime risk is so high and it's really this role of this genetic

575
00:53:03,650 --> 00:53:07,610
predisposition that's playing a bigger role than the environmental risk factors for those people.

576
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:17,989
So there's kind of this this genetic continuum, I would say, and then sort of like in this almost separate category where genetics are really.

577
00:53:17,990 --> 00:53:23,719
KING, are these hereditary cancer syndromes? But, you know, you hear about people who are like, well, I don't think smoking's that bad.

578
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:29,000
My grandmother, you know, drank a fifth of whiskey and smoked a lucky, strikes her whole life and lived to be 95.

579
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:34,760
And you're like, that is fantastic for grandma. My grandma was on this line.

580
00:53:35,510 --> 00:53:41,210
We are not all so lucky to win the genetic lottery. Most of us, if we smoke a bunch of cigarets, it's not going to end well.

581
00:53:41,250 --> 00:53:45,319
Right. So, you know, there are certainly variations and it's not a guarantee.

582
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:52,280
Right. Being exposed to something isn't a guarantee to get cancer. It just increases the likelihood there will always be counterexamples.

583
00:53:53,090 --> 00:54:02,330
But that doesn't mean that it isn't really a risk factor, right? Like I said, you know, you've got the majority of lung cancer.

584
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:09,090
Is in people with a history of smoking. But 10% ish happened and never smokers.

585
00:54:09,750 --> 00:54:14,610
Could be some second hand smoke exposure. But like you said, radon.

586
00:54:14,610 --> 00:54:18,479
Right? Radon is a cause of lung cancer. There's some occupational causes, lung cancer.

587
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:21,840
And there's some genetic causes, too, right. That are just.

588
00:54:23,270 --> 00:54:31,100
Or it's just bad luck because as much as they make fun of the bad luck paper when they're saying most cancers are due to bad luck, some are right.

589
00:54:31,110 --> 00:54:40,460
Like some people do everything right. Avoid all of the major risk factors and you still end up with cancer because some aspect of it is,

590
00:54:40,910 --> 00:54:45,590
you know, there can be sort of random mutations that occur during cell division.

591
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:49,320
Right. In the absence of any risk factor in particular.

592
00:54:50,070 --> 00:54:57,360
So there is an aspect of that. And then we think about intervention strategies, right?

593
00:54:57,360 --> 00:55:03,290
So. If someone's an average risk of cancer, you might suggest lifestyle changes.

594
00:55:03,290 --> 00:55:06,930
Right? Don't smoke. Try to eat healthy food. Try to move your body.

595
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:13,450
Whatever. If you're at moderate risk, you might have a more aggressive screening schedule, right?

596
00:55:14,230 --> 00:55:18,060
Like my mom had colon cancer, but she was young, so I really won the lottery.

597
00:55:18,070 --> 00:55:23,380
Got to start having colonoscopies when I was 30. You're so great, right?

598
00:55:23,410 --> 00:55:27,850
Most people have got to wait until they were 50. Now, 45, they changed it in the last couple years.

599
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:32,049
So my husband's 49. I'm like, Oh, guess what? You get through this series.

600
00:55:32,050 --> 00:55:36,580
I know I'm not 50 my all but guess what? You're married to a cancer epidemiologist, so I know things.

601
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:40,149
You have to go now. He loves it.

602
00:55:40,150 --> 00:55:44,950
He's thrilled about the occupation. And then people who were hired, very high risk.

603
00:55:44,950 --> 00:55:46,809
You might be willing to do other things right.

604
00:55:46,810 --> 00:55:53,170
You might be able to be willing to do more chemoprevention chemoprevention with things that have other side effects.

605
00:55:53,170 --> 00:56:00,940
Right. If you are at very high risk, an example are people who are at very high risk of breast cancer might take something called Tamoxifen,

606
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:05,440
which is a drug that's often used to treat breast cancer, but you might give it to very high risk women.

607
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:08,620
It has other side effects. You wouldn't want to give it for a super long time.

608
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:16,240
It can affect other gynecologic cancers, but if you're at super high risk of breast cancer, it maybe is worth the tradeoff, right?

609
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:20,860
We might also do other things. If someone is at super high risk of cancer,

610
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:25,210
can anybody think of an example of something you might do if you're at super high risk of breast or ovarian cancer?

611
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:32,739
Double mastectomy. Yeah. Prophylactic surgery, right. I think that's a big high profile example of this.

612
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:37,510
A few years ago was Angelina Jolie, right? She tested positive for BRCA1 or to mutation?

613
00:56:37,510 --> 00:56:42,520
I don't I don't know whether she actually told anybody, but she had a prophylactic.

614
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:47,970
Prophylactic. Meaning before she had cancer, she had both breast removed and both ovaries.

615
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:52,340
Which you probably wouldn't.

616
00:56:52,350 --> 00:56:58,680
You know, there are people who we're going to talk about when we talk about some of the familial cancer syndromes like for colon cancer.

617
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:04,920
There's a fap which stands for familial adenomatous polyposis, which is quite interesting.

618
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:10,350
And these people start getting thousands of polyps in their colon at a very young age.

619
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:16,500
And so if they start developing polyposis, you can't remove them all to prevent each of those polyps from becoming a tumor.

620
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:19,460
There's just too many of them. So they'll have a prophylactic colectomy.

621
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:26,489
They'll have their colon removed and they have a colonoscopy colostomy bag for the rest of their life.

622
00:57:26,490 --> 00:57:30,540
But they don't get colon cancer. So that's a fairly radical.

623
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:35,050
Thing to do right. You would have to be at very high risk, which they are.

624
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:45,400
So. All right. So we have the three categories of cancer prevention, primary prevention, where you eliminate or reduce the agents that cause cancer,

625
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:52,600
secondary prevention, which is basically screening, and then tertiary prevention, which is survivorship rehabilitation, palliative care.

626
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:58,510
So there's a lot of examples of primary cancer prevention where we we have a lot of tobacco control policies.

627
00:57:58,650 --> 00:58:03,310
We've tried to get people not to, you know, to cover up in the sun and wear sunscreen, etc.

628
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:12,069
You know, we've been somewhat successful with cigaret smoking rates. So if you see this black line is the per capita excuse me,

629
00:58:12,070 --> 00:58:17,200
cigaret consumption over time you can see it really started to take off in

630
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:20,590
the twenties around World War Two is when it really started to take off high.

631
00:58:20,620 --> 00:58:27,340
Right. The male lung cancer death rate mirrors that almost exactly about 20 years later.

632
00:58:28,530 --> 00:58:32,490
And the female lung cancer death rate is a little bit different because uptake was different in women.

633
00:58:34,830 --> 00:58:40,170
I think that's. I mean, the black men in the blue line are pretty amazing, honestly.

634
00:58:41,410 --> 00:58:44,650
It's like the exact same thing, just lagged by like 20 years.

635
00:58:45,850 --> 00:58:52,580
But you can see what I mean about lung cancer was. Super, super rare before the cigaret epidemic.

636
00:58:54,950 --> 00:58:58,130
And, you know, tobacco history in the U.S. is is very interesting.

637
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:00,860
We're going to talk quite a bit about this when we get to the smoking lecture.

638
00:59:00,860 --> 00:59:05,930
But, you know, there was a lot of government money for tobacco farmers, huge public acceptance of cigaret smoking,

639
00:59:06,350 --> 00:59:10,130
a lot of promotion of smoking in advertising and very easy access to tobacco

640
00:59:10,850 --> 00:59:13,970
and a lot of denial of health effects of tobacco by the tobacco companies.

641
00:59:15,050 --> 00:59:21,620
And I think I don't know, most of you are probably in your twenties, I would guess every every time I teach this class,

642
00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:25,309
I feel like I get fewer and fewer people who remember these things with me.

643
00:59:25,310 --> 00:59:32,000
But like, how many people remember smoking sections in restaurants? How many people remember the cigaret vending machines?

644
00:59:34,130 --> 00:59:39,020
That's how everybody I knew who smoked in high school got their cigarets because they had a big sign on that said you had to be 18.

645
00:59:39,020 --> 00:59:43,570
But it was outside of the gas station where nobody was checking anything.

646
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:47,240
So you were like you pulled a little thing and there Cigarets came out.

647
00:59:48,470 --> 00:59:56,730
It was great. My other thing that I really like to tell people is. You're not going to make things at school for like your dad for Father's Day.

648
00:59:58,670 --> 01:00:01,670
You're looking at me, you're like, I know where this is going.

649
01:00:02,540 --> 01:00:05,660
Yeah, I made my dad an ashtray out of clay.

650
01:00:05,870 --> 01:00:12,320
You laugh. We all did. Every child in kindergarten made a little clay ashtray, used a little finger to make a little slot.

651
01:00:13,070 --> 01:00:16,470
And you're shocked. But this was normal. I asked my husband, Did you do that?

652
01:00:16,490 --> 01:00:22,070
He said, Oh, yeah, because like. And I remember thinking, I guess also when I'm a grown up, it was absolutely normal.

653
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:30,230
I want you to think about if a child today like if my child came home from Ann Arbor Public Schools with a clay ashtray,

654
01:00:30,470 --> 01:00:34,940
like the absolute fear that would happen would be unbelievable.

655
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:38,989
But that's how much it has changed in my lifetime. Just in my lifetime.

656
01:00:38,990 --> 01:00:43,580
But I'm not that old, I swear. But it's I mean, it's kind of a shocking cultural change.

657
01:00:43,580 --> 01:00:46,760
Right. And the fact that I tell you that you're like, oh, my God, you did what?

658
01:00:47,540 --> 01:00:50,980
Totally normal. Every kid did this right. Every kid did this. Yup.

659
01:00:51,410 --> 01:00:56,450
And that is my favorite example of how much we have culturally changed around smoking.

660
01:00:58,130 --> 01:01:03,350
So if you think this stuff is interesting, I recommend this book reads a little bit like.

661
01:01:05,650 --> 01:01:09,510
Was not the only word coming to my mind. Cultural. That's not what I mean.

662
01:01:09,510 --> 01:01:13,820
Not cultural espionage. What is it like? With some companies.

663
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:15,920
I don't know.

664
01:01:16,220 --> 01:01:24,330
It's like a whole whistleblower thing and, you know, all of the machinations of the tobacco companies to try to keep their product out there.

665
01:01:24,350 --> 01:01:29,780
It's very interesting book. Again, in all of your free time to read things that aren't related to school.

666
01:01:30,230 --> 01:01:36,160
So this is another is not not smoking related, but another primary prevention strategy.

667
01:01:36,170 --> 01:01:43,640
So this is from Australia. So they have a huge melanoma problem or did they made a lot of progress with things like that?

668
01:01:43,660 --> 01:01:47,180
So this is like a little cartoon character dude from Australia who.

669
01:01:47,210 --> 01:01:50,350
My understanding is that culturally it's like Tony the Tiger, right?

670
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:56,149
It's like it's like one of those advertising cartoon icon things that like everybody in Australia knows, it's like, Oh yeah,

671
01:01:56,150 --> 01:02:05,630
it's the sun smart bird guy because this ad campaign has been around for quite a while now and it's slip, slop, slap, seek, slide.

672
01:02:06,620 --> 01:02:13,760
So slip up some clothes, slop on some sunscreen, slip on a hat, seek shade or slide on some sunglasses.

673
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:16,010
So this this slip, slop, slap,

674
01:02:16,010 --> 01:02:22,520
si slide ad campaign has been around for a long time and they've actually made a lot of progress in reducing melanoma in Australia.

675
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:28,200
So a secondary cancer prevention screening. We're going to have a whole lecture on screening.

676
01:02:29,010 --> 01:02:32,250
We've got breast, cervical, colorectal and lung that are proven effective.

677
01:02:34,110 --> 01:02:39,000
We have other ones that are not proven effective. Prostate is like a big.

678
01:02:40,610 --> 01:02:45,919
A big brouhaha, another kerfuffle, I would say, another scientific kerfuffle around prostate cancer screening.

679
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:49,879
So we'll talk about the ins and outs of that one when we get to that lecture.

680
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:53,810
But that's another fun controversy.

681
01:02:54,800 --> 01:03:00,200
Another big back and forth is the screening you're talking about there. PSA, yes, PSA screening.

682
01:03:00,620 --> 01:03:04,370
The issue with PSA screening is it is not specific for cancer.

683
01:03:05,540 --> 01:03:08,690
PSA is a is a protein that is normally made in the prostate.

684
01:03:09,530 --> 01:03:16,010
And if you have any kind of prostate tissue disruption, your circulating levels of PSA should be in your prostate.

685
01:03:16,100 --> 01:03:19,700
Right. But if your tissue is disrupted, you can get prostate.

686
01:03:19,940 --> 01:03:25,580
You can get PSA in your blood. Essentially, prostate tissue disruption can happen for a lot of reasons.

687
01:03:25,690 --> 01:03:29,350
It can happen because you have cancer. It can happen because you have benign prostatic hyperplasia.

688
01:03:29,490 --> 01:03:33,290
Anybody ever seen those ads for like, do you have a going problem or do you have a growing problem?

689
01:03:33,290 --> 01:03:34,730
That's like a little man made out of pipes.

690
01:03:35,270 --> 01:03:41,930
So it's just an enlarged prostate that happens a lot in older men and causes urinary symptoms, but it also causes the PSA to go up.

691
01:03:42,890 --> 01:03:53,690
So not at all related to cancer. If you've had recent intercourse, if you've recently written about if you have prostatitis infection of the prostate,

692
01:03:53,690 --> 01:03:57,650
any of those things can cause your PSA to be higher than it should be.

693
01:03:58,820 --> 01:04:02,740
So. If a man has high PSA.

694
01:04:03,310 --> 01:04:05,890
What do they do to see if he has prostate cancer? What's the next step?

695
01:04:07,180 --> 01:04:12,160
If you test high on a screening test, what's the next thing they're going to do? Send you for a biopsy?

696
01:04:12,910 --> 01:04:20,300
Do you know how to do a prostate biopsy? Does anyone know how to do a prostate biopsy needle?

697
01:04:20,990 --> 01:04:23,990
It's a needle biopsy. They put it's trans rectal.

698
01:04:24,380 --> 01:04:34,250
Right. So they use ultrasound guided rectal thing and they put it in there and they're taking they don't really look for a particular lesion.

699
01:04:34,970 --> 01:04:39,770
They kind of do. But they also are just taking a random sample because prostate cancer tends to be multifocal.

700
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:44,180
If you have one spot, you probably have more spots. So if they find one spot, there's probably others.

701
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:49,399
So they might target that spot. But they're also going to just take a random sample of the periphery of the prostate.

702
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:53,270
So I think it's like 12 needles now. They go up and they get like 12 little corners.

703
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:58,669
So you can imagine this is A not pleasant and B, actually has some risks associated with it.

704
01:04:58,670 --> 01:05:01,909
You can have a bleeding afterwards. It's not ideal, right?

705
01:05:01,910 --> 01:05:06,890
So that's not great. And then they find prostate cancer and they treat it.

706
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:11,209
What's the treatment for prostate cancer? That's one of them.

707
01:05:11,210 --> 01:05:14,360
But if you have very early prostate cancer, what's the first thing they would do? Nothing.

708
01:05:15,740 --> 01:05:19,910
Well, now. Yes, your your your your your spoilers.

709
01:05:21,650 --> 01:05:24,830
Spoilers. The first treatment would have been surgery.

710
01:05:25,670 --> 01:05:31,760
What are the side effects of prostate surgery? Incontinence, sexual impotence.

711
01:05:32,630 --> 01:05:36,680
Not good. Most men have a lot of sexual side effects after a prostatectomy.

712
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:41,749
And if you take a 65 year old guy who has maybe 30 years left to live and you

713
01:05:41,750 --> 01:05:45,810
tell him he has to wear a diaper and can have sex for the rest of his life. That is not great.

714
01:05:45,890 --> 01:05:51,590
Right. That's poor quality of life for that person. So if the treatment did nothing, it would be fine to treat everybody.

715
01:05:51,620 --> 01:05:56,059
The problem is PSA is finding if you do look at autopsy studies,

716
01:05:56,060 --> 01:06:01,550
you look at men who died of something else from before, like eighties before PSA was available.

717
01:06:02,540 --> 01:06:05,629
And you look at their prostates in the oldest of them,

718
01:06:05,630 --> 01:06:13,490
80% have prostate cancer that was never diagnosed in their lifetime because it was never clinically relevant.

719
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:16,540
They died of something else before they ever got diagnosed with prostate cancer.

720
01:06:16,550 --> 01:06:18,230
These men clearly did not need treatment.

721
01:06:18,950 --> 01:06:24,650
But if they had been living in the era of PSA screening and had gotten screened, they would have found it and treated it.

722
01:06:25,010 --> 01:06:30,290
And they may have ended up with all of the side effects that they didn't need. So there is clearly an overtreatment problem.

723
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:33,980
Now we're getting much better at refining what to do about it.

724
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:35,960
Right? We look at stage, we look at grade,

725
01:06:36,620 --> 01:06:43,309
and there's this whole active surveillance protocol where basically if someone has if you find prostate cancer in the biopsy,

726
01:06:43,310 --> 01:06:45,500
but it's a very low stage grade prostate cancer,

727
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:51,050
you would probably just follow that person up with repeated PSA test to see if their PSA starts going up.

728
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:55,640
And if it kind of stays steady, you would not treat that person depressed effectively.

729
01:06:57,290 --> 01:07:00,620
So that is becoming more of a thing. But it's very.

730
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:07,470
A lot of prostate cancer research is around trying to find a better test that identifies.

731
01:07:08,730 --> 01:07:15,630
Cases that need treatment, not just these indolent cases as well as clinically relevant cases.

732
01:07:16,950 --> 01:07:20,190
So that's an example of how screening can be.

733
01:07:21,060 --> 01:07:26,130
It's not always good, right? We think of screening as being something that's always good and it can actually do harm.

734
01:07:28,970 --> 01:07:36,610
All right. So lots of different screening controversies that we will talk about.

735
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:40,629
But there's also, you know, some examples of tertiary cancer prevention.

736
01:07:40,630 --> 01:07:46,150
And this may come up more in like some of you may be interested in survivorship and

737
01:07:46,150 --> 01:07:49,750
tertiary prevention kinds of questions with the cancers that you get assigned to.

738
01:07:49,750 --> 01:07:53,110
Right. We're not going to talk about it a lot in kind of the detective lectures of the class.

739
01:07:53,740 --> 01:08:01,870
But many of you may have a cancer where one of the remaining questions that you may want to address is like survivorship issues, right?

740
01:08:02,710 --> 01:08:09,160
Here's an example of tertiary prevention. This look good, feel better, that dot thing from the American Cancer Society, right?

741
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:15,730
Trying to provide wigs and and things that make people feel more like their appearance is normal after cancer surgery.

742
01:08:17,380 --> 01:08:22,040
We think of this as being. Wigs for people with chemo, things like that.

743
01:08:22,040 --> 01:08:26,450
But when we get to the head and neck lecture, you're going to see one of the biggest issues without it.

744
01:08:26,900 --> 01:08:33,440
Does anybody know what I mean by head and neck cancer? I think when I say had a lot of times people think brain but had neck is actually

745
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:36,290
anything from the vermillion surface of the lip down through the larynx.

746
01:08:37,100 --> 01:08:43,970
So it's a lot of mouth, cancer, tongue oropharynx, which is like the tonsils and then the lyrics, the voice box.

747
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:48,560
So people who have had neck cancer, the treatment is pretty, pretty rough.

748
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:54,139
Right? The surgery that things like people like Dr. Chin do is utterly amazing.

749
01:08:54,140 --> 01:08:59,450
When you see these pictures, like the first picture, you're gonna be like, Oh, no, no, that looks bad.

750
01:08:59,900 --> 01:09:06,020
And then you're going to see it right after. It'd be like, Oh, oh, and then six months later, like, Oh my God, how do you do that?

751
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:09,350
Like the reconstruction that they can do is absolutely amazing,

752
01:09:09,830 --> 01:09:15,739
but preserving the ability to talk, to eat and having your face, I mean, it's your face, right?

753
01:09:15,740 --> 01:09:20,480
I mean, I think women I mean, I also have this here, right. With women undergoing mastectomy.

754
01:09:21,170 --> 01:09:27,590
This is an example of tertiary prevention. Right. So when women undergo radical this person has had a double radical mastectomy.

755
01:09:28,010 --> 01:09:33,110
So she's got scarring kind of across the front of the breast. And she's had reconstructive surgery.

756
01:09:33,110 --> 01:09:37,129
She's had implants. Right. So to reconstruct the breasts.

757
01:09:37,130 --> 01:09:42,370
But you don't have any nipples. Right, because the nipples are removed when you have a mastectomy.

758
01:09:42,910 --> 01:09:46,060
And so this was something that kind of went around social media.

759
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:54,240
Sort of virally. A few years ago, this guy in Maryland used to be that they would do the reconstructive tattooing of the nipples at the hospital,

760
01:09:54,420 --> 01:09:57,660
and they were kind of like, okay, do you want like light pink, medium or brown?

761
01:09:58,290 --> 01:10:03,960
And it was like a circle. Which is really kind of a foot in the Pacific.

762
01:10:04,620 --> 01:10:09,519
Right. So it's not really this guy is a tattoo artist and this is an example of his work.

763
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:14,030
You know, he's done shading. I mean, it looks like. Real.

764
01:10:14,510 --> 01:10:22,530
It's amazing. Right. And so for a woman who wants to look in the mirror and feel like her body is normal again, this is huge.

765
01:10:22,550 --> 01:10:26,510
Right. Other people choose other things, right? Some women don't choose reconstruction.

766
01:10:27,110 --> 01:10:31,009
Some women I've seen have beautiful, like scar cover up tattoos that are amazing.

767
01:10:31,010 --> 01:10:39,800
Right? Like a huge flower or something. And just like you've made something beautiful out of something that was obviously very traumatic for you.

768
01:10:39,830 --> 01:10:44,150
Right. So there's lots of ways that people can deal with kind of the sequelae of surgery.

769
01:10:44,450 --> 01:10:51,080
But when it's your face, there's no like you can't put on a shirt and have it be hidden.

770
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:52,940
It's out there for the world. Right.

771
01:10:52,940 --> 01:11:01,759
And so having that cancer is one of those where survivorship issues and the outcomes of treatment are a big deal and can be really rough

772
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:09,410
for patients because talking and eating is a huge part of being a social person and being able to interact with other people and raise.

773
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:16,110
Okay. And then this is another example, tertiary prevention.

774
01:11:16,110 --> 01:11:19,700
So I mentioned the sexual side effects that a lot of men experience with prostate cancer.

775
01:11:19,710 --> 01:11:29,850
So Daniela Wittmann is a researcher at the Cancer Center, and she works with men who are having prostatectomy and their partners.

776
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:34,420
So she has designed this whole kind of like web intervention for.

777
01:11:35,910 --> 01:11:40,050
She originally designed it for heterosexual couples like men and their wives or female partners.

778
01:11:41,370 --> 01:11:48,809
And they would both go through this kind of process before the surgery. So it really kind of set expectations and help them understand what they would

779
01:11:48,810 --> 01:11:53,370
need to do in terms of kind of like sexual rehabilitation after the surgery,

780
01:11:54,030 --> 01:11:58,420
because you can improve sexual function. Right. But it's not like it doesn't happen on its own.

781
01:11:58,440 --> 01:12:04,679
There's a lot of stuff that you need to do. And having your partner understand what's going to happen as well as you in setting those

782
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:09,420
expectations is really important and having that communication beforehand really improved.

783
01:12:10,260 --> 01:12:17,999
She's actually demonstrated through research that people who have experienced this intervention have had much better quality of life and better

784
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:25,020
outcomes because they kind of knew what to expect and how to how what they would need to do to improve their sexual functioning after the surgery.

785
01:12:25,530 --> 01:12:31,580
She's since, I believe expanded it to include. To be for single men and also for men with male partners.

786
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:36,770
So I think that's pretty cool work, right?

787
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:40,950
It's a very different aspect of cancer research than I am involved in.

788
01:12:40,950 --> 01:12:44,839
But it's, I think, really interesting. All right.

789
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:52,610
So this is kind of a flavor of what we're going to talk about this term and the kinds of things that we're going to go over.

790
01:12:53,180 --> 01:13:00,770
And I'm happy to answer any questions in the few minutes we have left. But that was a whirlwind tour of what EP at 621 is going to be like.

791
01:13:03,790 --> 01:13:07,220
Yeah. Um, I guess it's more of a curiosity.

792
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:11,400
Just talk about it. Like political viruses at all.

793
01:13:12,270 --> 01:13:16,649
Yeah. So. No, not so much, actually.

794
01:13:16,650 --> 01:13:21,300
But that is. That's more of a treatment kind of thing, right? Uh, we're not going to talk a whole lot about treatment,

795
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:29,900
but that is something that maybe you might want to explore as your research topic in your groups.

796
01:13:30,630 --> 01:13:35,520
There's little more room for that kind of backstory there. Any other questions?

797
01:13:35,550 --> 01:13:43,290
Yeah, well, I try to stay and I actually don't know.

798
01:13:43,380 --> 01:13:46,620
That is a big question. There's a lot at large.

799
01:13:47,820 --> 01:13:52,100
There is some literature, something about the speculation, frequency and prostate cancer.

800
01:13:52,110 --> 01:13:58,259
So the idea that more or less things are sort of like flushing out toxins in the

801
01:13:58,260 --> 01:14:02,430
prostate because the president's job is to make a component of ejaculation of.

802
01:14:02,610 --> 01:14:10,200
Okay, so I guess if there's carcinogens in that fluid, if you're getting rid of it more frequently,

803
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:13,450
the idea is that is the kind of biologic rationale for that hypothesis.

804
01:14:13,950 --> 01:14:21,060
But I don't actually know don't think that that's true for bladder cancer.

805
01:14:21,180 --> 01:14:28,350
Say it again, like bladder and bowel cancer, like if you excrete more famous people have been to have talked about whether life retention,

806
01:14:28,350 --> 01:14:31,920
time for bladder cancer or like transit time for colon cancer is an issue.

807
01:14:32,970 --> 01:14:37,110
I think the transit time thing has not really been proven to be shown, but the bladder cancer,

808
01:14:37,110 --> 01:14:47,300
I think there might be more to that, although I don't recall for sure. I actually think a lot of my knowledge in like technology.

809
01:14:48,660 --> 01:14:55,400
So I spent a lot of time, I think, but we spent a lot of time looking at the peripheral blood.

810
01:14:55,720 --> 01:14:59,250
Yes. Yes, it is. But identifying is still incredibly long.

811
01:14:59,430 --> 01:15:03,310
So so for me, I can do it for prostate kind of stuff.

812
01:15:03,510 --> 01:15:07,920
But as I've gotten a lot of prostate blocks, I can tell the difference between muscle and not bone.

813
01:15:08,130 --> 01:15:13,140
There you go. Yeah, yeah. Crusty tumors, big little circles.

814
01:15:13,950 --> 01:15:18,120
It's supposed to be glands and they like, bless their hearts.

815
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:21,840
They're trying so hard, but they just been circling. It's like, what happens?

816
01:15:22,890 --> 01:15:27,600
So I can kind of. I can kind of do that. Oh, yeah.

817
01:15:27,690 --> 01:15:38,120
Please. Okay. Okay, I.

818
01:15:39,740 --> 01:15:46,500
And then I might need.

819
01:15:48,580 --> 01:15:54,310
I don't know. Oh, really?

820
01:15:54,550 --> 01:16:07,360
So thank you so much for making my journey on the way to an amazing experience to get started.

821
01:16:07,830 --> 01:16:11,810
I think that is exactly.

822
01:16:11,860 --> 01:16:18,430
Yeah. I mean, it's an organic it's pretty serious and.

823
01:16:18,470 --> 01:16:23,110
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I will tell you something.

824
01:16:24,230 --> 01:16:30,969
Yeah. Just like, yeah, we want to show people that, you know, it's not necessarily.

825
01:16:30,970 --> 01:16:42,820
I told you I did very well. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I know that that's how we wrote the script by I have nothing to show.

826
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:46,419
Like, yes, for sure. I am really onboard with that.

827
01:16:46,420 --> 01:16:53,049
But it's true that he's like, Have you done this?

828
01:16:53,050 --> 01:17:04,240
Come out here? And I said, Yeah, but I don't want to go, you know, that that's I just, I don't know yet.

829
01:17:04,250 --> 01:17:12,760
So I'm still try to do something with his, you know, even with him before I was buying me something like, Oh, you wanted to play something with this.

830
01:17:13,090 --> 01:17:20,530
Yeah, yeah, I might have you. I emailed you and I said I did, I emailed API Friday to make sure that.

831
01:17:21,370 --> 01:17:28,389
So everything. Yeah. Are you. Because the fact is that I mean better to try to do that I'm absolutely yes.

832
01:17:28,390 --> 01:17:34,510
Okay. Okay. Yeah I wanted to I'm so excited to do that.

833
01:17:34,510 --> 01:17:34,960
I'm glad.

834
01:17:35,380 --> 01:17:49,950
I mean, yes, it is really like, what are you saying is in it, I or my colleagues or but it is meant to be taken during the class period in that class.

835
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:54,970
Okay. But it is, it will be 2 hours and going it's one hour.

836
01:17:55,540 --> 01:18:05,769
Yeah. Yeah, that's, that's and I have of course because I'm, I have a young girl in the class that I have like debating because I only you.

837
01:18:05,770 --> 01:18:12,340
I know it's totally Alexey. No I wouldn't buy something fresh.

838
01:18:12,580 --> 01:18:15,900
Yes. Just shopping. I really am.

839
01:18:15,910 --> 01:18:24,580
That's right. That's right. Yeah I know. And so when I like all the other people through that conversation, it might take 24 hours.

840
01:18:24,580 --> 01:18:27,880
But that automatically happens, though not immediately. Okay.

841
01:18:27,910 --> 01:18:34,649
I do get people sometimes I wonder then that is what I'm going through.

842
01:18:34,650 --> 01:18:37,870
The difference 24 hours and it hasn't happened. Do it now. Okay.

843
01:18:37,870 --> 01:18:49,470
Perfect. Perfect. Thank you so much. You're welcome. So, you know, of course, because of this, you know, our economic the same day and the same time.

844
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:53,470
So also with this. So we're just a house. How is that possible?

845
01:18:53,800 --> 01:19:02,950
Yeah, we are from Palestine Department. Okay. Yeah, we have six, 602 and we have so we are just wondering, we can work it out.

846
01:19:02,950 --> 01:19:07,899
We can work that out. I'm not worried about that. We'll find the time because it's it's on canvas.

847
01:19:07,900 --> 01:19:12,790
And so if you need to take it at a different time, I can make it available. I can change for you to the time.

848
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:18,400
So that's at a different time of day or whatever. It's I mean, it's going to be the same day.

849
01:19:18,610 --> 01:19:26,170
Okay. It just different. It's actually we're going to have the first exam before this class and they just come right after the class.

850
01:19:26,680 --> 01:19:31,600
If you if you needed to do it at a different day, we could figure out a time like if it would be better for you to do it,

851
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:35,650
like sitting for the day after, we'll figure that out. Like, I'm not worried I can work with you.

852
01:19:35,860 --> 01:19:39,730
Okay, I'm gonna things and then thank you. Thank you so much.

853
01:19:39,910 --> 01:19:50,100
Now I just wanted to introduce my family members from India and so many thought to go ahead and hire hesitation process.

854
01:19:50,110 --> 01:19:58,350
Yeah, it's hard. It is. I actually got introduced to this concept being done this year, but I had to pronounce someone in Tel Aviv can.
