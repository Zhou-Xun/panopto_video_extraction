1
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:17,680
Okay. So this is our outline.

2
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:31,330
So to there we are going to use the same. Okay.

3
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:36,100
So today we're going to use the same pass out to further the following.

4
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,229
So first we are going to further pull some model and other elements.

5
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:46,450
Later on, we are going to use phone parts to compare these two models.

6
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:57,100
So this is going to show we're going to use the the emphasis of our C of e t patients who

7
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:02,590
are accessing the number of exacerbations they have experienced in the previous year.

8
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:12,430
And we are interested to explore the association between logic variables and the number of exacerbations.

9
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:25,780
So this is our outcome, I think is our predictor of interest here, and we will treat both as a continuous predictor.

10
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:30,340
So these are the variables we are going to use.

11
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:43,600
So what exactly is this our outcome variable and this account variable, we can see how the values range from zero on to and so on.

12
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,910
Now, while setting aside our predictor of interest, it is a continuous variable.

13
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:58,740
Be five for a vote. Yes. Our our our coverage now scanner is a categorical variable here.

14
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,749
So let's just get started.

15
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:09,960
The first example, we are going to use a picture to show the photo model.

16
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,589
Now we're going to set another two and 3 to 4.

17
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:27,800
So I'm comfortable I'm using test. So to show that partial version, in fact we first impart our dataset into that now in this Day Times column,

18
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:39,090
except that I'm using packaging now per channel procedure and now we round out our from the right here.

19
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:52,890
So this is our model, it crashes along, we put our outcome up here and these are our predictors and specify distribution errors.

20
00:02:53,130 --> 00:03:03,720
So because we are going to put some pressure and then among all these predictors, McCarthy, the scanner variable is a categorical variable.

21
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:11,340
So we put scanner in the past that specify reference as this category.

22
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:19,200
And I also run this code on this is the output.

23
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:28,920
So these are all the coefficients, all of very here and then how come this is our fault and we'll catch.

24
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:35,120
And next we are going to share those, Sarah, in fact, model.

25
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:41,810
Now, here are some analyzes that we are going to first through the model with our co-founders.

26
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:47,660
We will choose no significant co-founders for those, just a model.

27
00:03:48,950 --> 00:04:02,860
And then we set up their own model. So to fell through is rated for song and fat, so you use the same calls as previous one.

28
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:11,920
However, you made your change up distribution to sit here because we're are going to show that's how you try to model and.

29
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,890
In this model, we are going to set another goal, just a model.

30
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:32,310
So you yourself zero models train them and put all the predictors from the logistic model and y so that's called it we'll give to output.

31
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:46,770
So the first table is about all parameter estimates for carrying model and the second output is about how to optimize for logistic model.

32
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:51,600
And here we have seen a formal or just a model only.

33
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:59,030
After everyone there voicing their significant so.

34
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:04,270
So this is the only present we are going to include in our logic some model.

35
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:17,290
So here we just now we roll through inside a Porsche model with only A51 and then we'll just have regression.

36
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:28,930
So we only put everything on here. And then before we do our phone path, we need to progress.

37
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:33,629
Thanks, half. So here we say for all perfect probability.

38
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:41,320
They're allowed to use some tactic values here so that things resolve them to at the outset.

39
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:50,970
And using our SAP as our input data, we can further push them towards a model.

40
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:58,410
But this time we have seen our reporter outfit data here and we feel our pulse, our model,

41
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:07,110
and then save another data for a couple people and then to perform a phone test.

42
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:15,389
We need to use this LP that has out and we put the LP here as our input dataset function.

43
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:21,650
This is our outcome variable and our preferred model is model Y,

44
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:34,500
assuming that model and the second model is a model and the number of parameters in model one zero in the model is not so.

45
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:42,720
The way we get a number. So you don't see that resistor or infrared model.

46
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:50,340
So you have a one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

47
00:06:53,480 --> 00:07:00,980
Oh, wait a moment. That's why you have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

48
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:04,280
And in to term. So you have.

49
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:17,580
Thank you. Personal first model for the Porsche model you have one, two, three, four, five, six and plus into a short term.

50
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:21,210
So you have seven parametres in the model.

51
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:25,230
So you need a rhino track to fit your data.

52
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:35,640
You need to change the number it wants to run this macro, the output so you can see it from this output,

53
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:41,490
etc. imply that a partial model is preferred over a possible model here.

54
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:45,120
This is how you interpret the results.

55
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:54,870
And to throw the same thing in R to fit out for some regression, we first need to write out our model purchase here.

56
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:58,680
So this is our outcomes in cost to all the predictors.

57
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:04,800
And then using gyro function, I show your plus your formula and your dataset.

58
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,880
Now specify family equal step also and using lottery.

59
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:20,840
And after you run this function and save our results to fit puzzle, you can summarize your results using this graph.

60
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:27,590
Then it'll print all it has here and for Raul Castro shot.

61
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:41,520
And to Ralph sharing further caution using our your first name to download this package called PSA.

62
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:47,360
So you just install it. Damn, I love it.

63
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:53,390
And I write all this formula and not have that to further this model.

64
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:58,760
You need to use a vertical line here, so I'll be far further along here.

65
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:03,110
So moderate questions for count model after.

66
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:03,770
First of all,

67
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:16,760
I use all the predictors for logistic models and using zero and l function and punctuality questions here specified distribution as possible.

68
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:23,430
Then you can just run this code. It will work if you talk to Alchemist.

69
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:29,110
So the first output is this one. Apparently to estimates for account models.

70
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,690
And the second one is parameter estimate for logistic model.

71
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:44,940
And these are all low paid half here. And you can see I only have 51.7 U.S. in our model.

72
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:49,590
So this is the predictor we are going to include in logistic model.

73
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:58,860
So we are going to refer to searching for the models and using only one in order to show regression.

74
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:07,710
So here you drop all the variables and put a quantity here and we run the zero input models.

75
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:17,100
Then to perform a test in NA, you can just use this function from piecemeal per image.

76
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:22,240
So you put two models in the argument.

77
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:25,810
Now, once you run this code, this is a result.

78
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:31,050
So you can see that model one is preferred over model two.

79
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:34,870
So your model one is zero inflated model.

80
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:41,610
So. An actual phone call.

81
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:46,050
We are going to show now negative binomial models.

82
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:58,370
And without spoiling terms. And we are we are we are also interested in this term.

83
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:09,490
It's confidence in her Max we're going to use warp has to pass a null hypothesis that this term equals of a wand are not.

84
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:21,600
So to allow us to run a negative binomial model in SAS, we can use the same course.

85
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,340
I asked before,

86
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:32,820
but the need to change the distribution from partial to negative binomial and then to estimate this term we are going to use estimates.

87
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:38,930
So you can see these straight lines.

88
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:45,120
So to ask in this term, you can think of this term as.

89
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:52,340
Oh. So you kind of think next term in your combination of all coefficients.

90
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:04,760
So you put 0.25 after wall fake and you pop all zero four out of variables.

91
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:10,700
So we started with our goal coefficients for all of the inputs.

92
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:24,890
And also run this call solo for us. Cablevision's power to estimate for negative binomial and the second tables is the estimate for this term.

93
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:28,640
So you can see the pros and cons of a 1.1.

94
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:40,760
And this is its confidence interval. And this is a half p people go for a walk past.

95
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:49,140
So to run a negative binomial you are.

96
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:54,809
You need you download Mass Parish.

97
00:12:54,810 --> 00:13:05,760
So we are going to use geo being functional for Mass Parish and this is your model in questions and once I run this code it will give you this one.

98
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:12,570
All of that cash and two estimate equals 0.58.

99
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:16,110
How? Well say you need to tell another package call?

100
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:25,070
You outshone the Spanish and you put this contract factory here.

101
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:31,010
So this is just all the coefficients for a live in your company show.

102
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:45,830
So your post 0.5 here and all their families you sponsor out here so they're using geo HD function and here your puzzle this is your model

103
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:58,610
and this is your contracts factor and then take exponential office this and this is the output so you'll have the same values here.

104
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:08,810
And then you can just try to show in which table and this is how you interpret the results.

105
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:17,330
So you can see that for every cell point 25 millimeter increase in watching your COPD,

106
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:28,370
patients are expected to have 1.1849 times more reported exacerbation in the previous year or just for other coverage.

107
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:39,160
So you have to turn out the estimated for change on outcome based on wall effect margins.

108
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:46,910
And this is how you interpret the law test result for testing.

109
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:52,720
No hypothesis the E to a 0.15 very high also one or not.

110
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:58,070
So you can find a p value for this cash.

111
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,330
Trump here. Well, this is our people.

112
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:18,730
So for example, three, we are going to run the same negative binomial model with the strong terms.

113
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:29,310
So now we are going to create two spine trains to allow for balance at 1.4 millimeters and 1.7 millimeters.

114
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:34,560
So the lesson is that we first need to create two spine turns.

115
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:39,780
So we just do this in our dataset.

116
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:45,270
So create two spine currents. So this is our spine variable.

117
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:50,670
And this is a few questions for these two variables.

118
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:55,080
So this is our indicator function. And this is a difference.

119
00:15:55,620 --> 00:16:01,770
So, for example, for this variable, natural morphic values is 1.4.

120
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,410
Now this values what you purchased there.

121
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:15,570
However, if your logic value is greater or equal to 1.4 than your this value variable, what you got all one times the difference.

122
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:22,680
Yeah. And so, so this is our model questions.

123
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:28,860
So we add another two terms here using these two formula.

124
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:35,040
So to allow different range have different solve for this variable.

125
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:44,230
So you can see that if your while thinking if you have a 1.4, then your self off wall thing is equal to both.

126
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:49,140
How long since we switched or you have this here?

127
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:57,120
And if you are what it is between a 1.4 and 1.7, then your slope for whatever is based.

128
00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:06,390
How one task attached to for what make greater task 1.7 greater are equal to 1.7 pure.

129
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:10,800
So is both how one taught and how to possibly have three.

130
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:23,620
So. So to feel like a tough binomial with spintronics here we use the same cost as before.

131
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:32,800
So you specify a distribution are normal and you put another two spawn turns into your model statement.

132
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:44,290
And these three phone calls are going to atom for change of outcome based on the fixed values.

133
00:17:44,920 --> 00:18:01,060
So you have to estimate least value. We put so point 24 after market and to assume these values equals 0.45 after logic and the first four and so on.

134
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:08,460
So. Wait a minute.

135
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:15,040
Yeah. So you can just infer primary source here.

136
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:27,920
So if you are interested to estimate FEMA, fold change for a 1.1.9 or 95 millimeters versus 1.7.

137
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:33,580
So the difference between these two. Yes, 0.55.

138
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:39,360
So you can see how the value is greater or equal to 1.7.

139
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:43,480
So you should look at the service line here.

140
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:52,780
So to do the same thing, you need to first create a spine first.

141
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:58,870
And this is how you create a spine. So you create the indicator variables.

142
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:00,550
Times that the French.

143
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:13,780
And the same amount in your from one of your albums to terrible to a lonely partials and I'm using client B function to further negative binomial.

144
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:31,840
I want to run this card. You can just print all of the House and the Senate has to assemble after me for full change on I'll outcome you too.

145
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:41,390
Since we have two additional strong terms, you'll need to estimate three facts for the record.

146
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:51,950
So this is our estimate. The fact for the first range and the second range and the third branch and this is our result.

147
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:04,440
For example, for we are going to run run a zero inflation negative binomial model.

148
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:15,930
So to run this, in fact we only need to change the distribution to simply here.

149
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:19,980
So this is a zero is negative on your model.

150
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:25,010
Here we put on the 51 P in our largest scenario.

151
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:43,750
Yeah. Yeah. And to run sarah invite negative binomial in model we will use the same function used before for to insert a potion.

152
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:51,400
So we are going to use this function bar. We should stratify this distribution as negative binomial here.

153
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:55,890
So these are all those things. Yeah.

154
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:59,500
Okay. Carter. I'm so far.

155
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:01,420
Okay.
