1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:05,910
Morning. How are you guys doing? Just hanging in there.

2
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:13,020
Got a new month ahead of us. Okay, so I did post and I'm going.

3
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:19,290
I'm almost done grading the exams. You just have to go through them one last time today and then I'm hoping I'll get them posted.

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:27,840
Working on the first case study, I posted your second case study and you this up here.

5
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,790
So you have a choice. Just do one. Okay.

6
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:38,790
So there's one that focuses on hypertension that's more of like an outpatient type of situation.

7
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:49,830
And then there is one that's related to heart failure patient, which is more of like an inpatient type of case.

8
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:53,700
So choose one to do. You can look them over.

9
00:00:53,790 --> 00:01:00,750
Usually it's like pretty good mix each year about half to the heart failure have to choose that hypertension.

10
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:14,940
I think. Well, let me look at my due date. If you do November 20th, it'll be open until the 27th.

11
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:18,690
I would try and get it done by the due date just because you're we're going to have

12
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:22,890
a couple assignments at the end of the year because you'll have a third case study.

13
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:27,419
But keep that in mind. So you have a couple of weeks to get going on that.

14
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:31,320
And we will, of course, go over hypertension and heart failure in class.

15
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:42,390
You have a smaller assignment due next week, so we will be looking at a article, a meta analysis,

16
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:48,570
one of the more controversial meta analyzes that has come out regarding saturated fatty acids and cardiovascular risk.

17
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:54,149
So we'll take a little bit more of a deep dive into the data unsaturated fatty acids.

18
00:01:54,150 --> 00:02:02,070
So I do want you to read this article that I posted here, and our plan is to discuss this next Thursday.

19
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:08,520
So have that submitted. It's just like a brief write up based on your review of this article.

20
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,469
Okay. So you can just kind of narrate it doesn't have to be in in like a paragraph form.

21
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:18,120
Just there's certain points you have to hit. So I would just answer each kind of question.

22
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:25,590
You can even do it just bulletin. Okay. And then we will discuss that in a little bit more detail together next Thursday.

23
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:33,659
So have that ready prior to class. So if you if you look over these, you guys have any questions, just let me know.

24
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:40,049
We can we can discuss any questions on Thursday, too. So lots of things coming up.

25
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:47,640
But I think this this next kind of series of looking at and we're definitely going to look at MMT,

26
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:57,600
but we're going to spend a little bit more time also on like the epidemiology of cardiovascular disease, because we it's the data is not always clear.

27
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:07,020
And so I think it warrants a little bit more of like a deep dive into kind of the history prevalence and what has changed and in the research.

28
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:12,090
Okay. So does anybody have questions before we get started today?

29
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:23,390
Right. I'm going to try a new way to record so that hopefully we don't run into any issues with Panopto.

30
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:29,120
We'll see. Okay.

31
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:41,870
Okay. So did everybody watch the recorded lecture on lipid metabolism?

32
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:53,360
Was that a review? Someone I think Dr. Bridges Bridges class probably went into the tablet with the metabolism.

33
00:03:54,590 --> 00:04:02,360
Okay, good. Make sure if you haven't watched that it is important to have a kind of just that baseline understanding of that whole process.

34
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:08,059
So today we'll go into a little bit more depth in terms of the disease process of

35
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:12,710
atherosclerosis and then also talk about cardiovascular disease risk assessment.

36
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:22,100
So our learning objectives for today is to I want you to be able to describe the path of physiology of arterial plaque formation,

37
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:28,370
also known as atherosclerosis and include including the role of LDL cholesterol.

38
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:35,629
Should be able to explain the anti anthropogenic properties of HDL cholesterol and

39
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:41,210
then also list modifiable and non modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease.

40
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:50,700
Yes. We'll kind of make a complex process a little bit more simplified for for today's class.

41
00:04:50,700 --> 00:05:01,530
But atherosclerosis is involves the narrowing and loss of elasticity of the blood vessel wall, and this is caused by an accumulation of plaque.

42
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:09,330
So typically there's going to be a initially of what we refer to as an initiating event on this,

43
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,180
the lining of the blood vessel, which is lined by endothelial cells and it's referred to as the in time.

44
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,430
We'll watch a short video.

45
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:28,170
Does anybody know what we would consider like an initiating event that may kind of trigger this whole process and there is this whole process first,

46
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:38,940
what can cause some initial damage to that arterial wall, but then it releases like some chemical signals that there's an issue.

47
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:45,540
It recruits white blood cells to the endothelium, which then turn into what we call macrophages,

48
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:50,580
which ingests LDL cholesterol and forms what we call solar cells.

49
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,560
And that's kind of the beginning of that plaque buildup.

50
00:05:53,580 --> 00:06:00,480
But can you think of what might trigger this process if we think about risk factors for atherosclerosis?

51
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:06,730
One diabetic. Damaging to the blood vessels.

52
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:15,100
Over time, they're going to have to stop them now. So very poorly controlled diabetes.

53
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:18,250
Is diabetes a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease?

54
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:22,300
Yes. So it could be for poor blood sugar control.

55
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:26,440
Could relate to this process. What else?

56
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:33,820
Some other things that are known to be like initiators of this would be smoking.

57
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:38,530
So smoking can cause damage to that arterial wall that can kind of set off this process.

58
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:42,600
Hi. LDL, circulating levels of LDL in the blood.

59
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:55,270
So lots of things can kind of trigger this. So platforms, when inflammation stimulates a response by these white blood cells known as monocytes,

60
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:04,360
these are going to evolve into macrophages, which then ingest oxidized LDL cholesterol and become full cells.

61
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:11,769
And again, we'll watch a video that kind of explores this a little bit further oxidized LDL.

62
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:19,480
So when it is modified, the LDL that is delivered to the arterial wall, when it becomes modified or oxidized,

63
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:26,530
that is a particularly dangerous form of LDL and that is highly pathogenic.

64
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:31,540
Now we tend to refer to good and bad cholesterol.

65
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:36,610
It is a much more complex story than that. So do we need LDL cholesterol?

66
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:41,320
Yes, of course we do. It's involved in digestion.

67
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:46,030
So some of it is delivered to the liver or it's turned into biosolids, which we use for digestion.

68
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:50,889
It's involved with hormone production, cell membrane synthesis, lots of things.

69
00:07:50,890 --> 00:08:01,390
Right? So we need it. However, some LDL or excess LDL can be delivered to the arterial wall, and that is why it can be very problematic.

70
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:10,220
Okay. So the clinical manifestations of cardiovascular disease do present in adulthood.

71
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:16,820
However, evidence has demonstrated that the atherosclerotic process begins early in childhood.

72
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:28,139
Now, does anybody know? You may not, but these seven stories, which is like the first kind of clinical evidence we have of this process,

73
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:31,880
do you know at what age we see evidence of fatty streaks?

74
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:38,860
Yeah, it's. It's very.

75
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,889
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So we'll talk a little bit more about this.

76
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:48,290
But if anybody heard of the Bogalusa Heart study, the very,

77
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:58,669
very instrumental study in our understanding of cardiovascular disease during childhood and manifestation and to adulthood.

78
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:08,060
And so this was done in a rural town in Louisiana, and it is been just such an important study.

79
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:18,170
And so autopsy data from the Bogalusa Heart study found evidence of that in 50% of the subjects from age 2 to 2.

80
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:26,270
I think in that particular study it was 15. So even as early as age two, we have evidence of that age groups happening.

81
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:33,469
Okay, so the Bogalusa data also demonstrated that with increasing age, BMI,

82
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:39,770
blood pressure and love lipid levels, the prevalence and severity of atherosclerosis increases significantly.

83
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:50,510
Okay, so smooth muscle cells within the deep layer of the fatty streak are susceptible to cell death or apoptosis,

84
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:55,910
which is associated with further macrophage accumulation and perhaps contribute

85
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:59,570
to the transmission of fatty streaks into these atherosclerotic plaques.

86
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:08,870
As the plaque grows, the artery at first compensates by expanding outward, so it kind of leaves the size of the lumen unchanged.

87
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:17,690
But over time, the plaque decreases the side of the lumen, and these plaques can become unstable and rupture, which may cause the demise.

88
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:29,940
So this is if this, of course, happens. Well, there's actually two kind of phases of after two corpses or two presentations,

89
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:37,590
one that occurs very slowly over time, just a slow narrowing of the sides of the lumen.

90
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:43,020
There's other parts that are more acute where you have this thrombosis happen.

91
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:48,240
And this can lead to like an MRI or like a myocardial infarction, heart attack.

92
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:55,310
Okay. So I want to taper. You have a couple of short videos to watch today.

93
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:05,230
This first one. Can you see it?

94
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:22,150
The specific apolipoprotein. You don't need to know for this class.

95
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:30,070
You can measure AP levels, which I think is independently associated with cardiovascular risk.

96
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:33,490
But we're going to focus mostly just on LDL here.

97
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:40,970
Okay. So it's often referred to as bad cholesterol.

98
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:52,340
Yes, it's more complex than that. That in the sense that that is the lipoprotein was intimately linked with the sclerotic process.

99
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:56,930
So you'll hear about particle size, important. So particle size.

100
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:05,000
So smaller LDL particles are problematic because they can penetrate the arterial walls a little bit easier.

101
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:14,240
But with LDL, really all LDL particles, regardless of their size, increase the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular events.

102
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:22,340
So sometimes you'll hear that the larger particles aren't as bad, and that can be true, but they still pose a risk.

103
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:27,290
Check this out. Think? Yes.

104
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:34,400
Is there a certain threshold question saying how many the U.S. how it that 70% of total cholesterol?

105
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:42,050
What's the threshold percentage number for LDL for that?

106
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:51,979
Yes. And we also have a slide on typical ranges because we'll look at total cholesterol, but this has components.

107
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:59,480
So we will look at what is a typical percentage of HDL, LDL, all of that.

108
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:04,510
Yeah. And you have to have it.

109
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:11,260
Is it reversible? Yeah. I would say to some degree, yes.

110
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:17,569
Like we probably all of us I would that all of us have fatty streaks right now.

111
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:24,770
But the atherosclerotic process that's involved, watch a short video on that can be reversible to some degree.

112
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:32,420
Yes. But I do think probably like the fatty streak development, somebody has asked me this before, is it inevitable?

113
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:41,720
I would say probably so, because it does start so young to be very difficult to completely avoid that process.

114
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:52,140
That's not true. But we're not going to go. We're not going to do this today.

115
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:16,080
All right. Does that help?

116
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,150
Kind of. I know the videos sometimes aren't great, is it?

117
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:32,549
It's kind of helpful to see that process and kind of understand why that oxidation of the LDL is so problematic in terms of sending out those signals,

118
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:40,890
recruiting those monocytes, which then ingest it, turn into macrophages and then begin this this atherosclerotic process.

119
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:54,269
Okay. So those macrophages that have been modified by oxidized LDL also release a variety of inflammatory substances,

120
00:19:54,270 --> 00:20:00,090
cytokines, growth factors which causes further oxidation of LDL.

121
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:03,629
Endothelial cell activation and monocyte recruitment.

122
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:06,840
So this just accelerates the genesis process.

123
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:12,900
So we have very strong evidence that these modified LDL particles are pro-inflammatory.

124
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:20,340
Okay. So the key point here is high LDL cholesterol is associated with atherosclerosis.

125
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:29,910
So we have pretty strong and consistent data to demonstrate that elevated LDL associated with risk for cardiovascular events.

126
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:46,170
All right. So let's talk about HDL. So high density lipoprotein cholesterol in contrast to LDL and the LDL particles.

127
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:50,490
These HDL has anti anthropogenic properties.

128
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:54,990
So this includes removal of cholesterol from macrophages.

129
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:03,180
So kind of reversing that process that we just saw to some degree and you'll hear that is different,

130
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:09,120
different terms, but it could be termed as macrophage cholesterol efflux or reverse cholesterol transport.

131
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:17,279
There is an anti oxidation effect, so HDL can protect against that.

132
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:26,730
Oxidation of LDL, which we know is so dangerous, can also protect against inflammation, may promote maintenance of the endothelium.

133
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:35,700
So preventing hopefully that initial injury to happen and later here with the thrombotic component of that process.

134
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:45,800
So, yes, we turn this to good cholesterol. It's much more complex than that.

135
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:51,680
So that really kind of simplifies it. We'll discuss HDL in a little bit more detail.

136
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:55,819
But this reverse cholesterol transport,

137
00:21:55,820 --> 00:22:03,920
so this is essentially the removal of excess cholesterol from macrophages and it is the first step in its transfer to the liver,

138
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:07,610
where much of it can be used for the formation and secretion of bile salts.

139
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:13,400
So I think you can measure how efficient somebody is doing this.

140
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:21,230
So measures of this macrophage cholesterol efflux are inversely correlated with incidence of cardiovascular events.

141
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:28,340
So that's really good. And this entire process is also referred to as reverse cholesterol transport.

142
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:32,480
So anybody heard of this is what's your understanding of HDL?

143
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:37,340
In terms of it, why? It's good. Did you know that this was part of the reason why?

144
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:43,930
Okay, great. This is the last little video.

145
00:22:52,830 --> 00:26:15,750
Okay. Okay.

146
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:32,220
Okay. So that kind of gives us a summary of like the good properties.

147
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:39,270
So HDL cholesterol levels are associated with low levels of high microns.

148
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:43,080
The diagonal remnants, which are kind of like the precursors for LDL,

149
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:50,700
also associated inversely with small dense LDL particles, which are actually the most problematic.

150
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:57,090
So the key point is high HDL cholesterol is associated with a lower risk for atherosclerosis.

151
00:26:57,150 --> 00:27:03,090
So there is we do consider this like the good cholesterol.

152
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:07,440
So I mentioned it's a little bit more complex than that.

153
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:15,070
But for purposes of this class, I think that's sufficient. Now we have that reverse cholesterol transport.

154
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:18,719
There is some HDL that sometimes does the opposite.

155
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:26,220
So it can deliver LDL to the arterial wall, which is not what we want it to do.

156
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:35,190
But that does happen. So it's although it is involved in this process, it's a little bit more complex in terms of the total,

157
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:44,309
more recent as there's a couple of papers that have come out that have kind of question, is the higher HDL the better, right?

158
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:46,230
So like we would think the higher the better.

159
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:54,809
There's been some paradoxical associations with cardiovascular events, with very high HDL, with an increased risk of events.

160
00:27:54,810 --> 00:28:04,140
And these are newer papers. I haven't really read them. So, you know, keep keep an eye out for further data on HDL.

161
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:10,349
Now, I want to talk about how we raise HDL.

162
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:15,030
We'll talk about this a little bit further. Do we have drugs that lower LDL?

163
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:24,120
Do you guys know what those are called? Talk about a little bit later, isn't that right?

164
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:29,470
A big class of drugs, lots of people that so effectively lowers LDL.

165
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:37,150
Have you ever heard I always forget the name of a drug called Torcetrapib.

166
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:44,350
Somebody sort of. Do you want to talk a little bit about it?

167
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:48,800
You don't have to. Not much of may talk about what it was.

168
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:52,750
It was a topic of conversation with my daughters. They decided against it.

169
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:57,070
So I don't know a lot of the specifics. Okay. And there may be other clinical uses for it.

170
00:28:57,250 --> 00:29:03,180
However, this was a drug that millions of dollars was put into.

171
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:08,440
And it raises HDL, this drug, and it was successful.

172
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:16,000
It could raise HDL by 60%. This drug never made it past phase three clinical trials.

173
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:21,520
Does anybody know why we have the successful drug statins that lowers LDL?

174
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:30,430
So what about a drug that raises HDL? It was not successful, so it raised HDL considerably.

175
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:34,710
There was no decrease in atherosclerotic cardiovascular events.

176
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:40,750
There was actually an increase in blood pressure and an increase in deaths.

177
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:44,620
So it didn't make it out of that phase three trial.

178
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:49,270
So this was going to be like a huge, huge drug and it just kind of failed miserably.

179
00:29:50,350 --> 00:30:02,480
How do we increase HDL? Exercise is probably like if you if you had to give one answer, like, how can I best raise my HDL?

180
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,270
Say, physical activity, exercise? What else?

181
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:16,670
Just what other benefits do we get from physical activity? Those other cardio metabolic benefits of of exercise.

182
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:24,470
Right. Than just raising HDL. So if we just have a drug that raises HDL, that has not been shown to be helpful.

183
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:33,650
But if we raise HDL through other healthy behaviors like exercise, weight loss is associated with lower or higher HDL.

184
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:44,890
Stopping smoking can raise HDL some dietary components, not as much as other lipoproteins, but reduction of refined carbohydrates can raise HDL.

185
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:55,250
So all these other kind of healthy lifestyle factors that are probably multifaceted, that raise HDL is where we see the major benefit.

186
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:10,340
Okay. So we're going to talk about a lipid profile, but we do have pretty good evidence between and this is looking at total cholesterol.

187
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:20,840
As our cholesterol increases, our risk of cardiovascular events or cardiovascular disease also increases.

188
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:28,520
Now, we're most concerned often with LDL, but there are different other other measures we can look at as well.

189
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:41,700
Okay. So does anybody have a liquid profile drawing on them? Yeah, that's.

190
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:55,800
Torcetrapib torcetrapib. If you Google the illuminate trial from 2017 and read about that if you're interested.

191
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:06,210
Okay. So a standard blood lipid panel looks at total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol.

192
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:15,810
Now, we typically the ones that are ordered will also include triglycerides because that can be helpful in determining risk,

193
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:17,940
but but really helpful with LDL.

194
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:27,600
So LDL can be measured directly, but for the most part, the standard lipid profile will measure concentrations of total and HDL cholesterol.

195
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:34,050
Often triglycerides are added on. And from that, we calculate the LDL based on those levels.

196
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:41,360
So Serum, Total and HDL are measured directly.

197
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:45,240
Those can be obtained in fasting or non fasting individuals.

198
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:51,510
Triglycerides can be influenced by recent dietary intake,

199
00:32:51,660 --> 00:33:00,600
but it's really it's really acceptable practice to do a triglyceride level as part of a lipid profile in a non testing stage.

200
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:05,760
Now if somebody has a really high triglyceride level or very high LDL level,

201
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:12,210
you may be asked to go back and do it while you're fasting to maybe get a better a more accurate picture.

202
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:20,010
Okay. So there are some settings where it is practical for the patient to be fasting at the time of the screen.

203
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:24,629
And this might also be determined based on other risk factors.

204
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:32,070
If there is a history of hyper triglycerides into potentially diabetes where they would want to be fasting.

205
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:36,060
But in general, it is it's okay to take this in a non fasting state.

206
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:47,589
Okay. So total cholesterol measures, cholesterol contained in all lipoprotein fat fractions.

207
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:59,260
And this includes HDL. You'll often hear about the ratio of total cholesterol to HDL that's been looked at even more and more closely now.

208
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:02,770
So a smaller ratio is better, right?

209
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:10,569
So if you're looking at that as you're having like a higher amount of HDL and that's going to bring down

210
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:18,580
that ratio of LDL is usually considered the most important for assessing risk in deciding on treatment.

211
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:24,760
So if somebody is going to be started on statin therapy, usually that decision is made based on their LDL level.

212
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:34,239
Yeah, you have to have that higher a certain point.

213
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:40,900
How is it how do those studies talk about the ratio of the study time?

214
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:46,270
Yeah. So you mean like what I referred to with very high HDL.

215
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:58,480
So that is I would have to read those studies the first to really determine what they looked at and what is considered a very high level of HDL.

216
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:08,260
So I would say to them that I think that that's a body of evidence that supports a total HDL cholesterol ratio lower as being better.

217
00:35:09,730 --> 00:35:14,440
And sometimes they can also look at non HDL to HDL ratios as well.

218
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:19,419
Okay. So usually LDL is considered the most important.

219
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:27,040
However, some are starting to consider the ratio of total to HDL, a more discriminative predictor of risk.

220
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,879
But I think that that's kind of not necessarily controversial.

221
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:39,220
But I think for the most part, LDL in this is really important in terms of how we determine risk for cardiovascular disease.

222
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:50,410
Okay. So we'll look at optimal levels, but for you'll see an LDL level under 130 is desirable.

223
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:56,139
That's really kind of shifting more towards especially if you have a risk of heart disease or atherosclerosis

224
00:35:56,140 --> 00:36:03,550
to be under 100 and even more evidence now where some are pushing to keep LDL levels under 70.

225
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:05,440
And so we'll look at a chart,

226
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:16,780
but there's a little bit of inconsistency in determining which is which is like a goal and it might be really individualized.

227
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:29,680
So again, LDL, you don't have to know this, but it is computed or it is determined, calculated based on total cholesterol, HDL and triglycerides.

228
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:36,850
So it's total cholesterol, subtracting the HDL and then subtracting the triglycerides, which are divided by five.

229
00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:48,250
So you can see if you had a really exorbitantly high triglyceride levels, like if you ate like really high fat meals on the panel drawing,

230
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:55,900
that could could affect your calculation because triglycerides can be sensitive to dietary intake.

231
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:07,870
How can. Again, this this is kind of talking about some proportions.

232
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:14,350
HDL makes up about 20 to 30% of total cholesterol.

233
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:19,330
Again, we turn this as the good cholesterol that doesn't tell the whole story, but in general,

234
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:23,020
it does a lot of good and it moves cholesterol from the arteries to the better.

235
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:28,870
LDL cholesterol makes up about 60 to 70% of total cholesterol.

236
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:31,509
And again, that's the main form of that cholesterol,

237
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:39,820
because it can lead to that atherosclerotic process very low, be healthy, also very low density lipoprotein.

238
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:48,070
This makes up a smaller fraction, 10 to 15% of total cholesterol, and it is a precursor to LDL.

239
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:55,540
So that's why that's important. We don't typically measure that. But you could get there could be situations where that would be measured.

240
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:06,200
Okay. So this is still pretty consistent.

241
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:12,210
So total cholesterol. I like to see it under 200 LDL, under 100.

242
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:19,440
Some studies or some suggest even under 74, especially for high risk individuals, might be preferred.

243
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:31,500
This is a little outdated. So for HDL, we really want it over 40 for men and women, and then we see more benefit over 60 for everybody.

244
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:36,810
So if you're under 40, that is a risk one over 40.

245
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:46,410
And then we tend to see more benefit once it's over 60. That's the level that can protect against heart disease is over 60 for male and female.

246
00:38:47,850 --> 00:38:52,080
And then triglycerides can be we'd like to see them under 150.

247
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:57,770
So just a brief word on triglycerides.

248
00:38:59,090 --> 00:39:07,040
There's not a strong consensus on whether triglyceride level alone is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease.

249
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:15,800
And I've read both where that is is considered an independent risk factor and that it's not.

250
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:22,879
So some will suggest that concentrations of triglycerides do independently predict risk,

251
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:28,760
and others will argue that data to support this is based on a few studies using only

252
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:33,830
univariate approaches to suggest that triglycerides are predictors of coronary heart disease,

253
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:39,930
even if there is an independent. Go ahead. Yeah, that's okay.

254
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:48,070
I was wondering, like, what happens if, like cholesterol over 200, then you still also increase the ratio?

255
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:56,840
Yeah. Then they would want to see the ratio so that the utility of just the total cholesterol on its own.

256
00:39:57,290 --> 00:40:01,040
Yes. We see those graphs that show risk.

257
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:07,790
Those are a little bit dated because we do want to know that ratio, what fraction is made up of HDL?

258
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:18,580
In terms of triglycerides alone and risk, they do appear to have a relatively smaller predictive power.

259
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:30,009
Once you consider HDL levels and perhaps perhaps because there is a strong inverse relationship with HDL, and I'd say that's probably true with LDL.

260
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:40,540
So low HDL is a risk factor, primarily because a low HDL tends to be associated with high LDL and high triglycerides.

261
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:46,710
So as a result, when we look at risk models a little bit later,

262
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:52,720
triglycerides are usually not a major component of most of those risk stratification models.

263
00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:06,630
Okay. So the initial development of fatty streaks in coronary arteries is associated with high serum lipid levels and free radical oxidation.

264
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:12,750
The good news is both of those things are modifiable by nutrients.

265
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:25,560
Okay, so progression of coronary lesions is affected by serum lipids, hypertension, hyperinsulinemia, adiposity, oxidation, inflammation.

266
00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:30,959
All of these things can be mediated by both macronutrient and micronutrient intake,

267
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:38,160
and we'll kind of look at this a little bit closer over the next two lectures, but that's exciting, right?

268
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:45,630
Because it's kind of scary to think about this process that we know is probably happening to some degree, but we definitely can do something about it.

269
00:41:49,740 --> 00:42:00,030
Okay. So the management of risk factors for atherosclerosis, of which elevated LDL is a very important one, would be called primary prevention.

270
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:06,300
If this process is done in somebody who is not previously experienced an atherosclerotic vascular event,

271
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:15,090
the rationale for activities focused on LDL reduction is based upon epidemiologic data that documents a

272
00:42:15,090 --> 00:42:22,980
continuous positive rate of relationship between LDL concentration and cardiovascular events and mortality.

273
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:34,980
And there are strong evidence that lowering LDL in patients across a broad range of LDL levels reduces risk in patients with and without CVD.

274
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,260
So we tend to target those with elevated LDL.

275
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:46,590
There may be some benefit for lowering LDL in everybody, regardless of risk.

276
00:42:48,390 --> 00:42:58,350
And this is just taken from from up to date. Patients without known cardiovascular disease are generally at a much lower baseline

277
00:42:58,350 --> 00:43:02,729
risk of having a cardiovascular event than patients with known cardiovascular disease.

278
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:03,780
That makes sense, right?

279
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:13,589
So the decision as to whether LDL treatment should be recommended depends on a determination of global CVD risk as the potential for

280
00:43:13,590 --> 00:43:20,760
absolute risk reduction with treatment for hypercholesterolemia is usually going to be smaller than for patients with established CVD.

281
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:31,200
The reason I bring this up is because there's kind of two approaches to well, there's more than that, but to disease prevention.

282
00:43:32,850 --> 00:43:36,090
Does anybody read this paper or seen this paper by Jeffrey Ross?

283
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:40,680
Sick individuals, sick populations. It's from the eighties.

284
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:46,739
So it's you know, we've evolved a little bit, but this is actually the paper why I got into epidemiology.

285
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:50,129
I love this paper. I think it's really inspiring.

286
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:58,890
So in this work, Geoffrey Rose postulated that reducing the population distribution of a causal risk factor

287
00:43:59,130 --> 00:44:04,110
would have a greater effect on population health than targeting only those at high risk.

288
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:08,840
So we tend to do a risk based strategy here, right?

289
00:44:09,450 --> 00:44:12,750
You have high LDL cholesterol, so you're going to go down.

290
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:22,050
So we'll use LDL as example. But what if we were able to lower LDL across the population as a whole?

291
00:44:22,290 --> 00:44:29,730
Now, some people aren't going to benefit from that because they're probably normal and they would have never had cardiovascular disease.

292
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:41,280
But if you can shift a causal risk factor for a disease even modestly across a population, you have the potential to really lower that disease burden.

293
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:45,309
And that's kind of what he's getting out of this paper now.

294
00:44:45,310 --> 00:44:51,959
We have gotten better at identifying people at risk potentially than from the eighties.

295
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:54,600
So this still has some relevance, though.

296
00:44:55,530 --> 00:45:07,020
So if we think about this kind of approach, the either the high risk approach of the population approach, this is kind of relevant for for LDL.

297
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:16,200
Let's talk a little bit more about that. So we talked about the primary medication used in the management of LDL cholesterol or statins.

298
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:21,719
Right. They are highly effective. So lipid lowering, at least with statins,

299
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:28,140
is beneficial for the primary and secondary prevention of coronary heart disease in patients with dyslipidemia.

300
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:35,430
So those that have elevated LDL statins work by lowering the amount of circulating

301
00:45:35,430 --> 00:45:40,170
cholesterol in the blood and halting or slowing the formation of dangerous plaque.

302
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:46,800
Now, there are some there were some papers that came out a couple of years ago,

303
00:45:47,310 --> 00:45:57,270
and there are some in the medical community that really recommend that everybody over the age of 40 should be on a low dose debt.

304
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:03,330
So regardless of your risk, once you're 40, everybody should take a load of.

305
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:18,419
What do you guys think about that? You're shaking your head in this class for the future, so I didn't need to take that.

306
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:20,190
I've still got a sense.

307
00:46:20,790 --> 00:46:32,670
So maybe there is there's potential downsides to everybody being upset and why what else is there underneath exercise for them to change your diet?

308
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:37,620
We don't have to go to the doctor and don't have a lot less so.

309
00:46:38,550 --> 00:46:46,020
Well, of course we would love everybody to adopt the healthy lifestyles and behaviors that dietitians recommend.

310
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:49,290
Sometime it's not as easy. Yes, we would hope.

311
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:56,070
Taking a pill every day maybe would be helpful in reducing disease burden.

312
00:46:56,100 --> 00:47:02,280
What do you think? So how do we know if any of the side effects there is?

313
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:07,290
There are side effects of any drug, but yes, there are side effects of statins.

314
00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:14,280
And this is why this that theory really hasn't even been explored or adopted in the U.S.

315
00:47:14,970 --> 00:47:19,240
In the U.K., there's been talk of.

316
00:47:19,290 --> 00:47:21,390
Has anybody heard of the term poly pill?

317
00:47:23,490 --> 00:47:31,080
So if you if you're ever interested and with all your free time that I know you have, there's this idea of like a polypill,

318
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:37,980
which is kind of similar to this idea of after 40, everybody takes a statin, it's after 40, everybody takes a polypill.

319
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:45,510
And what it is, it's a low dose statin, a low dose of blood pressure medication and like some aspirin.

320
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:51,209
So in very low doses. So everybody, regardless of the risk, would take this.

321
00:47:51,210 --> 00:47:58,200
And the thought is that we could really substantially reduce disease burden and prevent a lot of cardiovascular disease.

322
00:47:58,620 --> 00:48:03,930
And again, some people would, of course, not benefit. That has not been very popular.

323
00:48:04,230 --> 00:48:07,710
But it is. It is a theory. Yeah. Like a lot of people are.

324
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:15,180
Yeah. This drug interact. Yes. So it's like that's why it's like, no, you can't just start a beta blocker.

325
00:48:16,170 --> 00:48:21,389
It needs to be very carefully implemented.

326
00:48:21,390 --> 00:48:29,670
But there there's talk of this using this kind of population approach, kind of like I guess the best example I can give is in it's not really related,

327
00:48:29,670 --> 00:48:35,580
but like vaccines, like we want population level coverage with vaccines to prevent disease.

328
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:40,260
And they're thinking if we have like a similar approach with cardiovascular disease,

329
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:45,150
which is the leading cause of death in this country, that could be potentially really influential.

330
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:51,360
Everyone taking a statin over 40 is not a popular idea,

331
00:48:51,540 --> 00:49:01,410
but it is something that has been kind of kind of presented and maybe is is kind of going back to that high risk versus population strategy.

332
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:05,560
All right. Let's take a look at statins.

333
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:15,460
Lipid lowering therapy with statins reduce relative cardiovascular risk by approximately 20 to 30% regardless of your baseline LDL.

334
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:23,460
So highly effective patients and their providers can decide usually what level of statin they would be on.

335
00:49:23,470 --> 00:49:34,690
So you can see low intensity can lower LDL on average by about 30% for moderate intensity closer to 30 to 50%.

336
00:49:34,690 --> 00:49:40,300
And those more high intensity, you can see a reduction of up to 50% or more.

337
00:49:41,410 --> 00:49:44,560
Yeah, it sounds very high.

338
00:49:45,070 --> 00:49:48,340
Yes, a lot of people are on them long term. Sure.

339
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:58,510
And what about have you heard take a baby aspirin every day to help with heart health?

340
00:50:00,810 --> 00:50:05,380
We did. This came out last year, right? It kind of said maybe don't do that.

341
00:50:05,690 --> 00:50:10,630
Even something like we talk about statins, which definitely there are side effects for some people,

342
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:18,100
even something like a baby aspirin taken daily, if not as benign as we thought.

343
00:50:18,130 --> 00:50:25,540
There can be a risk associated with this in the recommendation at this, I believe it's about remember posting this for the lecture last year.

344
00:50:26,290 --> 00:50:32,620
This came out that you really should not do that. You need to really discuss with your doctor if you're appropriate to start now.

345
00:50:33,070 --> 00:50:44,450
Yeah. You know, look, that was kind of. I think a while thinking really long time that it is considered a relatively low risk intervention to

346
00:50:44,450 --> 00:50:50,720
do like I'll just take baby aspirin every day to hopefully prevent the other risk of a heart attack.

347
00:50:51,050 --> 00:51:00,620
Yes. Well, ten, 12 years ago, I noticed that these people have no idea.

348
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:06,650
So I told them to stop. And that's for other people. Even the [INAUDIBLE] I tell people, just they still taking it.

349
00:51:07,350 --> 00:51:16,730
I think your doctor is not up to. Well, this is an intense non-steroidal anti-inflammatory, which remember, we talked about peptic ulcer disease.

350
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:25,670
If you have an ulcer. NSAIDs can can worsen that can cause GI bleeding, usually with higher doses.

351
00:51:25,670 --> 00:51:30,500
But this is not like the most the most simple safe thing that we thought it was there.

352
00:51:30,530 --> 00:51:36,200
When we have more long term data, we see that some of this these recommendations start to change.

353
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:48,030
Okay. Let's talk about cardiovascular disease, risk factors and risk assessment.

354
00:51:48,060 --> 00:51:53,070
We're not going to get through all of this today. Probably we'll pick up on it on Thursday.

355
00:51:56,010 --> 00:52:01,300
Okay. So despite increases in longevity, so people have heart disease, they are living longer.

356
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:04,770
People used to like an MRI, used to be fatal.

357
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:09,570
Like if you had a heart attack back in the fifties, a lot of times if you died from it.

358
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:18,989
Now people are living longer with cardiovascular disease, but cardiovascular disease,

359
00:52:18,990 --> 00:52:25,920
including coronary heart disease and stroke, remain highly prevalent and expensive to treat.

360
00:52:27,030 --> 00:52:34,679
And you can see the really significant increase here, really kind of like falls that tapers off.

361
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:41,220
But it's still it's still high. And we know that part of the disease is the number one cause of death in this country.

362
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:45,360
One point we thought cancer would overtake that was predicted to.

363
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:49,290
It hasn't. Some states look at states specific causes of death.

364
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:53,800
Cancer does lead as a number of states, but it's so overall, it's cardiovascular.

365
00:52:56,430 --> 00:52:59,640
Why do you think we saw such a sharp decline early on?

366
00:53:07,670 --> 00:53:12,860
Yes. Go ahead. More accurate tracking could be like data collection.

367
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:18,120
Definitely. But also, people were living long enough to develop heart disease.

368
00:53:18,150 --> 00:53:22,910
Once people used to die from infections and then once we had antibiotics.

369
00:53:23,390 --> 00:53:27,620
Okay, we can we can survive an infection.

370
00:53:27,620 --> 00:53:35,809
And now we live long enough to develop a chronic disease. And then why do you think it kind of started tapering off?

371
00:53:35,810 --> 00:53:43,970
If you look here in the sixties and seventies and all this is a lot of AP stuff, but why do you think that matters has tapers off there?

372
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:50,089
Yeah, there are low fat guidelines in the 1980s could be, which we will talk about.

373
00:53:50,090 --> 00:54:00,140
So maybe some dietary changes. What else? Improved treatment.

374
00:54:00,410 --> 00:54:08,180
Improved treatment? Yeah, right. Starting now, we can, like, open up arteries, you know, with stents we have medication.

375
00:54:08,190 --> 00:54:19,070
So all of that really helps because excessive heart surgeries probably also start to see like this is like big time smoking.

376
00:54:19,310 --> 00:54:24,260
And then smoking starts to decline once we realize, okay, this is really, really harmful.

377
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:28,910
People started to also stop smoking, but in the fifties and sixties it was really, really high.

378
00:54:34,430 --> 00:54:39,589
Okay. So as I mentioned, while CVD remains the leading cause of death in most developed countries,

379
00:54:39,590 --> 00:54:48,440
mortality from an acute MRI has appeared to decrease by as much as 50% in the nineties and 2000.

380
00:54:48,470 --> 00:54:54,350
So it used to be like if you had an MRI, a lot of times people would die from that.

381
00:54:54,350 --> 00:55:03,139
Now people are surviving. Many individuals in the general population have one or more risk factors for heart Airey Heart disease.

382
00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:13,010
So in 90% of coronary heart disease events, which coronary heart disease of course refers to atherosclerosis in the most simple form.

383
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:19,250
So 90% of these events occur in individuals with at least one risk factor.

384
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:25,170
So the five leading modifiable risk factors,

385
00:55:25,710 --> 00:55:34,050
which are estimated to be responsible for over or at least half of cardiovascular mortality, include hypercholesterolemia.

386
00:55:34,050 --> 00:55:40,230
So high blood cholesterol levels, diabetes, hypertension, obesity and smoking.

387
00:55:46,190 --> 00:55:54,560
And a lot of this data is taken from well-designed longitudinal studies.

388
00:55:55,520 --> 00:56:00,320
So if you fall part of that, hopefully as public health students, you have maybe not.

389
00:56:02,750 --> 00:56:05,930
What does anybody know about what can you tell me about the Framingham Heart Study?

390
00:56:11,420 --> 00:56:16,070
This was like our first cohort study. This was like kind of the birth of epidemiology.

391
00:56:17,330 --> 00:56:27,260
So it's a small town in Massachusetts, hardly homogenous population, but some of the data from that has been translated to other ethnicities.

392
00:56:28,670 --> 00:56:35,630
So essentially they looked at this town, people in this town in Massachusetts, and followed them for years,

393
00:56:36,530 --> 00:56:40,760
looked at the people that developed heart disease and then determine what the risk factors were.

394
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:46,820
So this is how we know a lot about risk factors for cardiovascular disease.

395
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:50,120
Is the Framingham heart set? Yeah. So have their. Yeah.

396
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:56,719
Are they always like have the levels changed or updated since very different studies on like what normal

397
00:56:56,720 --> 00:57:04,970
for and ranges for cholesterol LDL and you were saying like different races or different types of people.

398
00:57:05,540 --> 00:57:14,920
So the risk factors and that we have learned from the Framingham Heart Study has translated well into other race races.

399
00:57:14,930 --> 00:57:21,979
So it it was a Caucasian population so very much in the US, but it has translated pretty well.

400
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:32,420
Now we'll talk about the levels, what are considered normal because those have kind of trended down and we'll kind of talk about why.

401
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:44,330
And also and Heinz, we all know the Heinz data. We take so much of our population base nutritional data from intake cycles.

402
00:57:49,890 --> 00:57:54,290
Okay. So atherosclerosis is responsible for almost all cases, coronary heart disease.

403
00:57:54,300 --> 00:58:01,890
We talk about fatty streaks where there is evidence of that process starting early childhood and adolescence that can lead

404
00:58:01,890 --> 00:58:09,450
to that is associated with plaques in early adulthood and then that can lead to thrombotic occlusions events later in life.

405
00:58:12,810 --> 00:58:18,299
Okay. So optimal blood pressure, blood glucose, lipid values,

406
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:24,140
this kind of what can you was just talking about have been revised downward in the past 20 years.

407
00:58:24,150 --> 00:58:33,510
So concepts of normal have evolved from usual or average to more optimal values associate with long term freedom from disease.

408
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:46,980
Why? Why would these why would we go from average to more optimal levels based on disease prevention or lower risk?

409
00:58:49,590 --> 00:58:55,530
Yeah. Averages are probably a bit high considering the health of our population.

410
00:58:55,590 --> 00:58:58,709
Yeah. Is our. And not to pick on us.

411
00:58:58,710 --> 00:59:05,890
But are we a healthy population? Not really in general when we look at disease burden.

412
00:59:05,940 --> 00:59:13,110
So if we just took the average cholesterol levels of the average US adult population,

413
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:18,330
that might not be a great target for for what would be an optimal level.

414
00:59:19,270 --> 00:59:20,669
So we used to do that.

415
00:59:20,670 --> 00:59:34,020
So concept of even normal has evolved from just using average to going more towards what value would be optimal to prevent or modify disease risk.

416
00:59:41,570 --> 00:59:52,550
So we have seen that some major cardiovascular risk factors have declined to stay up substantially since the sixties, and this is as of early 2000.

417
00:59:52,970 --> 01:00:06,350
So serum total cholesterol has a level of greater than or equal to 240 milligrams per deciliter has gone from the prevalence of 34% to 17%,

418
01:00:07,610 --> 01:00:13,729
probably due to what therapeutics more people on statins?

419
01:00:13,730 --> 01:00:18,740
That it would be my guess maybe some lifestyle but we know we don't always have the best lifestyle behaviors.

420
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:24,200
What about hypertension? We see prevalence from 31 to 50%.

421
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:29,210
That could be higher depending on the the guidelines for those products have changed.

422
01:00:30,050 --> 01:00:36,580
Why do you think that is? Probably blood pressure medications.

423
01:00:36,580 --> 01:00:41,140
A lot of this is probably medication, really. They didn't really have those therapies back then.

424
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:47,920
And what about smoking? 39% of the population to about 26%.

425
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:59,450
What have we learned about smoking in this time period? One really that causes lung cancer.

426
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:04,130
You don't hear causality causal terms thrown out a lot in epidemiologist.

427
01:01:04,550 --> 01:01:08,570
Most would say smoking causes lung cancer. We have really good evidence for that.

428
01:01:09,590 --> 01:01:15,169
I'd say we're probably right, about 26, 25%, under 30% for smoking.

429
01:01:15,170 --> 01:01:16,129
We've kind of been there.

430
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:25,230
We probably think that that's maybe the best we'll get in terms of all the effort to reduce smoking, that may be where we're kind of going to stand.

431
01:01:26,810 --> 01:01:32,050
Might be interesting to see if it picks up just with, you know,

432
01:01:32,150 --> 01:01:39,680
we thought maybe with the change to more smokeless tobacco or vaping, maybe that would lower smoking.

433
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:43,520
Has that proven to be very helpful? All right.

434
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:46,690
So maybe we'll see that tick back up. I'm not sure.

435
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:58,230
Yeah. It's not to about it isn't just like cigarets here at this this would be tobacco like this.

436
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:04,760
This is like still cleaner. If we look now, that would be an important thing, like what is defined in smoke.

437
01:02:05,420 --> 01:02:22,670
But this yes I remember maybe ten years ago it would have actually made that decision that that's not the company smoking and most often have those.

438
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:28,800
And then I think this would be key smoke free campus sometimes.

439
01:02:28,850 --> 01:02:37,999
And I just thought it was a big move with the numbers swapping still.

440
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:45,320
But it just yeah, it is it is less but it's not hasn't gone away.

441
01:02:45,470 --> 01:02:52,549
It's still, you know. But yeah, it's been kind of socially unacceptable.

442
01:02:52,550 --> 01:03:00,400
You know, like people usually have like your smoking areas, which is it's probably good for general health in terms of the secondhand smoke data,

443
01:03:00,450 --> 01:03:07,130
but it is can be stigmatizing to people that are truly addicted to tobacco and feel kind of like another.

444
01:03:09,140 --> 01:03:16,460
But yeah, so that's kind of where we're at with smoking and we'll see if those trends stay or if, if, if there's any changes there.

445
01:03:22,540 --> 01:03:27,549
Okay. Risk factors in terms of age and sex.

446
01:03:27,550 --> 01:03:34,640
So it was historically thought that it's just cardiovascular disease is the disease of aging.

447
01:03:34,660 --> 01:03:42,640
Like you're just if you live long enough, you're going to develop that potentially some truth to that.

448
01:03:43,210 --> 01:03:47,170
Definitely. It's modifiable and you can prevent cardiovascular disease.

449
01:03:47,170 --> 01:03:54,489
But if you live long enough, you may you'll definitely, probably have some risk factors for it.

450
01:03:54,490 --> 01:03:56,890
We do see rates increase as we age.

451
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:09,490
So risk factors, cardiovascular risk factors promote CVD in either sex, so both males and females at all ages, but with different relative importance.

452
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:16,899
So history or presence of diabetes and a low HDL to total cholesterol ratio.

453
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:25,390
Now that's flipped. Sorry that I hope that's not confusing. We do on a low total the HDL cholesterol ratio below HDL to total cholesterol ratio.

454
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:29,230
That's it. So those two things operate with greater power limit.

455
01:04:29,230 --> 01:04:32,200
So those tend to be greater risk factors in women.

456
01:04:32,230 --> 01:04:40,870
If you have a history of diabetes and low HDL, the incidence of a myocardial infarction or an MRI, which is essentially a heart attack,

457
01:04:41,230 --> 01:04:50,290
is increased sixfold in women and three fold in men who smoke at least 20 cigarets per day when compared with those that never smoke.

458
01:04:51,100 --> 01:04:55,480
So operates a little bit more intensely in terms of smoking and and risk in women.

459
01:05:01,730 --> 01:05:12,290
Okay. This should just say wait status. Well, I guess we do discuss age here, but obesity or weight gain promotes all anthropogenic risk factors.

460
01:05:13,890 --> 01:05:26,299
Okay, so even a loss of like 5% body weight in this would be in folks that are obese or overweight and reduced LDL levels 3 to 5%, which is not much.

461
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:28,700
But that's that's still a difference.

462
01:05:30,860 --> 01:05:38,150
Physical inactivity will worsen some of these risk factors and can predispose subjects of all ages to coronary heart disease event.

463
01:05:38,180 --> 01:05:44,390
So a low, low activity, low HDL, all those things can increase risk.

464
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:50,570
And age alone really does appear to contribute to the development of CVD.

465
01:05:59,790 --> 01:06:05,340
I should say so. Is sex a modifiable risk factor for CVD?

466
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:09,479
No. What about age? No.

467
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:13,230
Family history. We can't change those things in terms of our risk.

468
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:19,079
So those would be non modifiable things. So family history is definitely a component.

469
01:06:19,080 --> 01:06:28,670
It is an independent risk factor for coronary heart disease, the development of atherosclerotic CVD or death from CVD in a first degree relative.

470
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:38,850
So if you have a parent or sibling prior to age of 55 and males or 65 and females would qualify as a significant family history.

471
01:06:41,310 --> 01:06:47,129
Your risk is with family history is high or especially potent.

472
01:06:47,130 --> 01:06:51,620
If you had someone in your family die very young of cardiovascular disease.

473
01:06:51,630 --> 01:06:57,750
So if somebody had a a fatal am I under the age of 50, that's a considerable risk factor.

474
01:07:00,450 --> 01:07:08,639
And then the risk of developing coronary heart disease in the presence of a positive family history has ranged from 15 to 100%,

475
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:15,390
depending on the cohort size. So that's a huge range, but most show about a 40 to 60% increase.

476
01:07:15,390 --> 01:07:23,100
So it is significant. Yeah, it's good to know there's a link between healthy levels and taking a look at that.

477
01:07:24,030 --> 01:07:35,220
Yes. So your so LDL in particular, there is a there is a genetic condition or like a familial hypercholesterolemia,

478
01:07:35,460 --> 01:07:42,000
which is that different things like that, even with healthy lifestyle people because of this genetic variant, that's an actual.

479
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:46,650
Yes. So they have elevated LDL. So they are kind of treated differently.

480
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:51,870
HDL is different levels are highly influenced by genetics as well.

481
01:07:59,560 --> 01:08:08,800
And I would say the definition of what constitutes a family history of premature atherosclerosis is is somewhat variable depending on the study.

482
01:08:08,810 --> 01:08:13,790
So you may see different definitions there. Okay.

483
01:08:13,790 --> 01:08:21,920
So hypertension. It is a well-established risk factor for adverse cardiovascular outcomes, including mortality from coronary heart disease and stroke.

484
01:08:24,630 --> 01:08:29,540
Well, we'll do it all day on hypertension, the determination of what blood pressure constitutes.

485
01:08:29,540 --> 01:08:32,899
Hypertension has shifted.

486
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:38,900
So even a couple of years ago, there's like new cut points which we'll we'll look at a little bit more closely.

487
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:41,300
But it kind of is a subject of debate.

488
01:08:42,650 --> 01:08:51,680
We also kind of need to consider what is the global blood pressure in patients who already have or are at high risk for cardiovascular disease.

489
01:08:51,980 --> 01:08:56,840
So this kind of goes back to like what is a appropriate goal for your blood pressure,

490
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:59,990
and that may be different for different individuals based on their risk.

491
01:09:09,150 --> 01:09:12,570
Okay. So talked a little bit about the lipoproteins,

492
01:09:12,570 --> 01:09:19,799
but the following lipid and lipoprotein abnormalities are associated with increased coronary heart disease risk.

493
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:28,140
So an elevated total and elevated LDL cholesterol, low HDL cholesterol HYPERTRIGLYCERIDEMIA,

494
01:09:28,140 --> 01:09:36,480
whether that's independently associated with CHB, is a little bit of a double increase on HDL cholesterol.

495
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:46,530
So all those other components, the LDL, LDL, total cholesterol and then those small, dense LDL particles.

496
01:09:52,790 --> 01:10:00,400
Okay. Diabetes is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease.

497
01:10:00,410 --> 01:10:09,500
So if we were able to prevent the, you know, a small portion of type two diabetes in particular,

498
01:10:10,220 --> 01:10:17,930
that would have a great impact on the prevalence and or incidence of cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular disease events.

499
01:10:19,010 --> 01:10:26,510
So insulin resistance, high blood levels of insulin and elevated glucose are associated with atherosclerosis.

500
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:33,580
And people with diabetes have a greater burden of other allergenic risk factors than people without diabetes.

501
01:10:33,590 --> 01:10:38,749
So we see higher rates of hypertension, obesity increased total.

502
01:10:38,750 --> 01:10:49,070
The HDL ratios, high triglycerides is often very much associated with elevated blood sugar levels in the coronary heart disease.

503
01:10:50,060 --> 01:10:55,190
Risk in people with diabetics will vary widely depending on the intensity of these risk factors.

504
01:11:01,750 --> 01:11:05,620
Okay. We talked a little bit about smoking, but let's just look at this a little bit.

505
01:11:06,430 --> 01:11:14,470
So cigaret smoking is and we're referring to like tobacco smoke is an important and reversible risk factor for heart disease.

506
01:11:15,310 --> 01:11:21,190
So smoking is an independent risk, major risk factor for total atherosclerotic CVD,

507
01:11:21,220 --> 01:11:25,840
coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease and all cause mortality.

508
01:11:26,380 --> 01:11:30,700
And we do see that pretty strong dose response relationship.

509
01:11:30,710 --> 01:11:35,440
So the more you smoke, the longer you smoke, the increase in risk that we see.

510
01:11:38,250 --> 01:11:41,489
So the inner heart study was like a global case control study.

511
01:11:41,490 --> 01:11:48,450
This looked at innocent lives of people that have had a heart attack plus I think like 52 countries.

512
01:11:48,660 --> 01:11:55,500
So case control, remember, we start with the outcome and then we go back and collect information on risk factors.

513
01:11:56,250 --> 01:12:00,720
So people that had an MRI and then we collect a lot of data on what their risk factors are.

514
01:12:03,030 --> 01:12:10,080
So a nice design because we don't it's not a cohort study where we have to we select our subjects and then have to wait for them to develop disease.

515
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:17,040
These people have had the outcome we're interested in and then we look back and of course there are some limitations with looking back.

516
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:28,730
But in the inner heart study of patients from over 50 or 52 countries, smoking accounted for 36% of the population attributable risk of a first MRI.

517
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:37,080
Conversely, the risk of recurrent am I in a study of smokers who had an MRI fell by 50% within one

518
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:42,810
year of smoking cessation and normalized to that of non smokers within two years,

519
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:56,219
which is pretty incredible. So it's never too late to cut back on smoking or definitely to quit because it is a reversible risk factor and your risk,

520
01:12:56,220 --> 01:13:03,180
even after a year or two of stopping smoking, kind of return to that of the person in the normal population.

521
01:13:03,750 --> 01:13:07,620
We also see that in cancer, just stopping smoking,

522
01:13:08,130 --> 01:13:17,100
your risk goes down considerably and then it goes kind of returns to just being so safe with what we would consider the normal population risk.

523
01:13:18,330 --> 01:13:24,540
So the benefits of smoking cessation are seen regardless of how long or how much the patient has previously smoked.

524
01:13:28,310 --> 01:13:34,500
Okay. Other lifestyle factors exercise, exercise.

525
01:13:35,460 --> 01:13:39,720
Even a moderate degree has a protective effect against coronary heart disease.

526
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:47,400
And all cause all cause mortality may have a variety of beneficial effects, including an elevation in serum HDL,

527
01:13:48,270 --> 01:13:53,610
a reduction in blood pressure, less insulin resistance, and for some weight loss.

528
01:13:54,810 --> 01:13:59,070
So in addition, the amount of exercise, in addition to the amount of exercise performed,

529
01:13:59,070 --> 01:14:05,100
the degree of cardiovascular fitness, which is a measurement of physical activity.

530
01:14:06,990 --> 01:14:15,450
So the degree of cardiovascular fitness is also associated with the reduction in coronary heart disease risk and overall cardiovascular mortality.

531
01:14:20,580 --> 01:14:30,059
Okay. So obesity we talk we we do talk about weight related risk a lot in this class

532
01:14:30,060 --> 01:14:36,540
which I know it's not not always like the students are always a big fan of that.

533
01:14:36,540 --> 01:14:44,790
And I understand why. And there are there's definitely some some nuance to the topic, but we're just kind of focusing on data for purposes of this.

534
01:14:44,790 --> 01:14:54,029
So obesity is associated with a number of risk factors for sclerosis, cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular mortality.

535
01:14:54,030 --> 01:15:01,110
So people who are classified as obese tend to have higher rates of hypertension,

536
01:15:01,290 --> 01:15:07,320
insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, hypertriglyceridemia and reduced HDL cholesterol.

537
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:12,300
Okay. So we go back to this Framingham Heart study.

538
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:23,190
So in an analysis from nearly 5000 adults in the Framingham offspring, say so this study is still going on of people, the offspring of the people.

539
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:28,530
In the original Framingham Heart Study, obesity is measured by BMI,

540
01:15:28,530 --> 01:15:37,410
significantly an independently predicted occurrence of HD and cerebrovascular disease after adjusting for traditional risk factors.

541
01:15:37,740 --> 01:15:44,730
Additionally, there was a continuous linear relationship between higher BMI and greatest risk of cardiovascular disease.

542
01:15:47,580 --> 01:15:54,389
In addition, the risk associated with obesity patients with more significant weight fluctuation.

543
01:15:54,390 --> 01:16:00,430
So fluctuations in body weight, so periods of weight loss followed by weight gain followed by weight loss.

544
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:07,140
Lots of fluctuation appear to also have an increased risk of future CVD events.

545
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:15,690
So cycles of weight gain and weight loss have been shown to be potentially problematic as well in terms of risk.

546
01:16:20,150 --> 01:16:23,090
And just briefly, I think we'll we'll stop after this.

547
01:16:23,090 --> 01:16:32,300
But patients in the highest quintile of weight fluctuation had significantly higher risks of any event and total mortality.

548
01:16:33,140 --> 01:16:40,280
So the data from the Framingham Offspring Study suggests that frequent cycles of weight gain and weight loss are associated with an increased

549
01:16:40,280 --> 01:16:47,870
risk of coronary heart disease and CVD events with the greatest magnitude of risk among those who are overweight or obese at baseline,

550
01:16:50,030 --> 01:16:54,210
which is a really struggle for people that do try to lose weight.

551
01:16:54,230 --> 01:17:02,600
Often it is there is a lot of fluctuation because it can be hard to maintain a level of weight loss after you've achieved that.

552
01:17:02,630 --> 01:17:09,260
So we're seeing that this this cycle of weight gain and weight loss may be problematic for some.

553
01:17:09,370 --> 01:17:16,579
Yeah, I did hear that. I think so.

554
01:17:16,580 --> 01:17:26,750
For this study, the main variability now this was out for 5000 patients was 3.9.

555
01:17:26,750 --> 01:17:32,690
So four kilograms, so £10 or so less.

556
01:17:33,290 --> 01:17:36,950
That was the mean. So there's, you know, there's a range there.

557
01:17:37,660 --> 01:17:43,850
It's not a whole lot fluctuation. Okay.

558
01:17:44,240 --> 01:17:50,270
Thursday. So what we'll do? We'll stop here. We're going to talk about diet in more depth.

559
01:17:51,860 --> 01:17:53,270
I think it's confusing.

560
01:17:53,510 --> 01:18:01,640
I have combed through the data on diet and cardiovascular risk and I'm still kind of lost in terms of what we should be telling patients.

561
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:10,760
So we'll look through that closely together and we'll finish up with some cardiovascular risk calculators, calculators, an assessment.

562
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:15,620
Then we'll jump into the. Does anybody have any questions today?

563
01:18:19,620 --> 01:18:28,200
Okay. Well, I will see you all Thursday. I got it.

564
01:18:35,070 --> 01:18:35,580
All right.
