00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:04,980
An income statement shows the revenues,
expenses, and

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:10,385
net income of an organization for
a certain period of time.

3
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:15,410
An income statement is also
called a statement of operations.

4
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:20,460
Unlike the balance sheet, which is
a snapshot of an organization's financial

5
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:25,860
condition at a particular point in time,
the income statement tells what

6
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:32,190
happened to an organization over
a period of time such as one year.

7
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:37,500
The income statement first presents
the revenues earned by an organization.

8
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:42,450
Revenues are monies an organization
receives in exchange for

9
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:45,810
the goods and services it provides.

10
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:48,260
Healthcare organizations, for instance,

11
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:53,970
receive large portions of their revenues
from providing care to patients.

12
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:59,580
The income statement then presents
the expenses incurred by an organization.

13
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:05,200
Expenses are the costs incurred to
generate revenues, examples include

14
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:12,480
salaries and wages, supplies,
utilities, and interest expenses.

15
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,740
For most health care organizations,

16
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:20,670
the single largest expense is
the salaries and wages paid to employees.

17
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:26,230
At the bottom, the income statement lists
the net income earned by an organization.

18
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:31,260
Net income is the difference
between revenues and expenses.

19
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:38,765
Net income is also called profit, excess
of revenues over expenses, or bottom line.
