1
00:00:06,159 --> 00:00:15,969
Joanna Kovacevich: My name is Joanna Kovac a bitch and I work on the SP ah instructional services team as the instructional technology consultant.

2
00:00:15,969 --> 00:00:26,499
Joanna Kovacevich: And this today we're focusing on our canvas course checklist and one of the main motivations for creating this checklist is there's so many things.

3
00:00:26,499 --> 00:00:41,109
Joanna Kovacevich: Little things we do at the beginning of a semester that are really difficult to remember how to do those things if you only at the beginning of a semester, or maybe you only teach in winter semesters and so.

4
00:00:41,109 --> 00:00:50,829
Joanna Kovacevich: I realized, we really just need a checklist of like Okay, I did this, I did this, I did that and so that's what I am going to share with you today.

5
00:00:50,829 --> 00:01:12,549
Joanna Kovacevich: Before we begin, I have enabled the zoom live transcript so in your zoom menu bar at the bottom, you should have a button that says live transcript which will give you the options to show the transcript in a subtitle view or view it as a full transcript in a side panel.

6
00:01:12,549 --> 00:01:21,039
Joanna Kovacevich: Something of note is that all of your meeting participants also have this ability, when you either when you enable it.

7
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:22,599
Joanna Kovacevich: or when you.

8
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:33,639
Joanna Kovacevich: Have it set so that students can request for you to enable the live transcript so for anyone that is teaching remotely.

9
00:01:33,639 --> 00:01:35,889
Joanna Kovacevich: next semester.

10
00:01:35,889 --> 00:01:53,379
Joanna Kovacevich: This live transcript button should be visible to all of your participants and we highly encourage you to utilize it it's really helpful to have that sort of text, backed up for anyone who might have hearing difficulty or is working in a lab location.

11
00:01:53,379 --> 00:02:02,199
Joanna Kovacevich: During this session today for any questions that you have, I welcome you to unmute your microphone.

12
00:02:02,199 --> 00:02:04,269
Joanna Kovacevich: You will be included in the recording.

13
00:02:04,269 --> 00:02:05,649
Joanna Kovacevich: Just as a reminder.

14
00:02:05,649 --> 00:02:11,019
Joanna Kovacevich: If you'd rather not be included in the recording please feel free to ask questions in the chat.

15
00:02:11,019 --> 00:02:18,549
Joanna Kovacevich: My colleagues are online today madea friend and toby is here.

16
00:02:18,549 --> 00:02:33,189
Joanna Kovacevich: And I may have a couple of Frederick may be joining us soon, and my colleague Monica rosen and they are going to assist me to make sure we don't miss any questions and then we get all of those addressed in the chat.

17
00:02:33,189 --> 00:02:49,809
Joanna Kovacevich: i'm going to ask you not to use the raise hand feature in the reactions, just because, while i'm screen sharing it's very difficult for me to see I will miss seeing, who has a hand raised so feel free to unmute or use the chat.

18
00:02:49,809 --> 00:02:55,059
Joanna Kovacevich: And our agenda for this hour is to introduce the checklist.

19
00:02:55,059 --> 00:03:04,569
Joanna Kovacevich: quickly look at what's new in canvas since the last time you've used it we're going to answer your questions so we're going to go back to that idea boards and go through those.

20
00:03:04,569 --> 00:03:14,859
Joanna Kovacevich: And then, as we have time i'm going to go back to our checklist and show you some lesser known tools or features that are in that checklist.

21
00:03:14,859 --> 00:03:22,929
Joanna Kovacevich: Alright, so let's get started with the fun part, and that is accessing the checklist.

22
00:03:22,929 --> 00:03:28,539
Joanna Kovacevich: i'm going to get my link.

23
00:03:28,539 --> 00:03:42,039
Joanna Kovacevich: And i'm going to put the link in the chat, and this is going to take you to a page that says, make a copy so go ahead and click that make a copy button.

24
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:49,929
Joanna Kovacevich: And what this is going to do is basically copy my checklist into your own Google drive.

25
00:03:49,929 --> 00:04:01,359
Joanna Kovacevich: That way, as you go through it you're only modifying and checking off items in your own specific document.

26
00:04:01,359 --> 00:04:09,729
Joanna Kovacevich: After you've clicked the make a copy button if you'd like you can go to the file menu at the top.

27
00:04:09,729 --> 00:04:19,929
Joanna Kovacevich: And there are options to rename it so say you wanted to make a copy maybe you're teaching two courses and you want to copy a checklist and name it with one course.

28
00:04:19,929 --> 00:04:30,429
Joanna Kovacevich: name to keep track of the items you've completed for that course prep and then make a second copy for maybe another course and rename it with that course name.

29
00:04:30,429 --> 00:04:51,519
Joanna Kovacevich: And then, because this item is going to go basically into your sort of loose in your my drive section, you could utilize the move option again under the file menu to organize that into a sub folder if you have your documents organized that way.

30
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:55,479
Joanna Kovacevich: When you are done when you have your copy.

31
00:04:55,479 --> 00:04:58,569
Joanna Kovacevich: And you have your copy open.

32
00:04:58,569 --> 00:05:07,599
Joanna Kovacevich: feel free to click on the reactions button in the lower zoom bar and click the green checkmark.

33
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:14,559
Joanna Kovacevich: This is gonna let me know that we're all on the same page.

34
00:05:14,559 --> 00:05:18,339
Joanna Kovacevich: And if you have questions or you're stuck.

35
00:05:18,339 --> 00:05:34,959
Joanna Kovacevich: feel free to give a shout.

36
00:05:34,959 --> 00:06:05,979
Joanna Kovacevich: And we also shared this checklist document out in an email shared by Frederick earlier this week or last week in the Semester transition So if you copied it then and want to just go and look at that one you are welcome to.

37
00:06:05,979 --> 00:06:12,459
Joanna Kovacevich: All right, most of you have that there are a few that do not yet.

38
00:06:12,459 --> 00:06:21,999
Joanna Kovacevich: feel free to if you're stuck let me know over the microphone or over checked.

39
00:06:21,999 --> 00:06:27,189
Joanna Kovacevich: Or, if you would rather we move forward.

40
00:06:27,189 --> 00:06:44,529
Joanna Kovacevich: Go ahead and use your reaction to let me know that you're all set.

41
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:46,629
Excellent.

42
00:06:46,629 --> 00:06:49,959
Thank you.

43
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:56,739
Joanna Kovacevich: Alright, well, I am going to go ahead and move forward and then, if there's anything I can do.

44
00:06:56,739 --> 00:07:02,229
Joanna Kovacevich: To answer questions, be sure to let us know.

45
00:07:02,229 --> 00:07:04,179
Joanna Kovacevich: Oh.

46
00:07:04,179 --> 00:07:13,329
Joanna Kovacevich: let's look at the checklist.

47
00:07:13,329 --> 00:07:27,789
Joanna Kovacevich: So Laura I think I accidentally gave you access to my document what I might ask you to do is come over to the file menu and make a copy.

48
00:07:27,789 --> 00:07:32,139
Lauren Owens: It could be was great out for me so that's why I just got out of bed.

49
00:07:32,139 --> 00:07:34,479
Joanna Kovacevich: I see I see.

50
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:38,169
i'm.

51
00:07:38,169 --> 00:07:48,159
sorry about that.

52
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:51,129
Lauren Owens: But I could download it and then just upload it to something else.

53
00:07:51,129 --> 00:07:53,199
Joanna Kovacevich: Is it allowing you to download.

54
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:54,189
Lauren Owens: looks like it.

55
00:07:54,189 --> 00:08:04,449
Joanna Kovacevich: Okay sorry about that I will I will review those settings see if I can get that resolved.

56
00:08:04,449 --> 00:08:09,399
Joanna Kovacevich: So some things that i've put here at the top, our.

57
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:17,199
Joanna Kovacevich: First of all, the very first link is to put in a ticket with our instructional services team, if you run into issues.

58
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:34,839
Joanna Kovacevich: If you have questions if you want to just talk something through something that you're thinking about incorporating into your class please feel free to submit a ticket and talk with one of our instructional services staff members we'd be happy to set up a one on one appointment.

59
00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:51,909
Joanna Kovacevich: um what's new in canvas the very first link will take you to a page or actually it jumps down to these headers in the section, but one of the items is a link to.

60
00:08:51,909 --> 00:09:09,309
Joanna Kovacevich: Our resilient teaching canvas site this canvas site is set up for open access the site was created at the beginning of the pandemic to help instructors slip into remote learning, however, as we're still in.

61
00:09:09,309 --> 00:09:21,369
Joanna Kovacevich: changing times and things needing to be resilient we've continued to populate and add items to this page so i'm going to switch over to the homepage real quick.

62
00:09:21,369 --> 00:09:24,489
Joanna Kovacevich: Just in case you want to bookmark this.

63
00:09:24,489 --> 00:09:31,659
Joanna Kovacevich: we've got what's new we list all of our workshops here, and this workshop will also be included.

64
00:09:31,659 --> 00:09:39,189
Joanna Kovacevich: resilient teaching resources pedagogy research resources and then again how to reach us.

65
00:09:39,189 --> 00:09:51,189
Joanna Kovacevich: So i'm going to go to the what's new tab because I know that's where my canvas updates link is, and so what I try to do with this page is.

66
00:09:51,189 --> 00:09:54,549
Joanna Kovacevich: keep you informed of things that are have been.

67
00:09:54,549 --> 00:09:56,469
Joanna Kovacevich: updated in canvas that might be relevant.

68
00:09:56,469 --> 00:09:57,639
Carlos Mendes de Leon: to you.

69
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:17,649
Joanna Kovacevich: So, right here, these are all items that have changed this fall semester, and so, if you've been teaching, you may have seen some of these changes come into effect, but if you are returning after not teaching for a semester these items will look new to you.

70
00:10:17,649 --> 00:10:28,539
Joanna Kovacevich: So feel free to scroll I have these if you scroll back down they implemented some things over spring summer event so just trying to help you stay on top of.

71
00:10:28,539 --> 00:10:34,449
Joanna Kovacevich: Changes additionally they've also implemented a way for.

72
00:10:34,449 --> 00:10:46,179
Joanna Kovacevich: Making those changes more visible, which wasn't available when I started this document, but in the left hand canvas global navigation there's a help button.

73
00:10:46,179 --> 00:11:05,829
Joanna Kovacevich: Which now POPs out a window and it will alert you to updates so as the release notes, so this is a great way to help you stay on top of what's changed in canvas since the last time you've been in it.

74
00:11:05,829 --> 00:11:18,219
Joanna Kovacevich: And i'm going to return back to the top of this checklist Another thing I want to point out briefly is what's on my canvas homepage and if you have been in your upcoming.

75
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:35,409
Joanna Kovacevich: canvas site for winter 2022 you may have seen that your site looks like this and you know that you didn't put that there we put that there and i'll just take this opportunity quickly to share what we did, and why we did it.

76
00:11:35,409 --> 00:11:42,999
Joanna Kovacevich: One of the things is we just wanted to help provide resources for everyone, as they are building their core sites.

77
00:11:42,999 --> 00:11:52,059
Joanna Kovacevich: One of the first things we added it in the winter semesters we survey sth students on their experience using canvas.

78
00:11:52,059 --> 00:12:13,599
Joanna Kovacevich: And we just provided some quotes that your students provided based on organization of the course or how the course is organized how easy or difficult it is to navigate is, by far, one of the biggest things the students give feedback on and so it's.

79
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:22,359
Joanna Kovacevich: And both for good comments and bad comments, so we just shared some of these to give you something to think about as you're organizing your course.

80
00:12:22,359 --> 00:12:29,049
Joanna Kovacevich: Across the top or our canvas best practices that you're welcome to read and explore.

81
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:33,669
Joanna Kovacevich: Information for setting up your canvas site.

82
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:41,049
Joanna Kovacevich: We have a link to some examples of effective SP H courses if you've seen that, on the heights.

83
00:12:41,049 --> 00:12:59,319
Joanna Kovacevich: And then, a link to import the SP ah course templates so if you're teaching a new course and building it for the first time, you might want to start with a template that kind of has our SP ah design and then this of course links back to our checklist if you'd like to make another copy.

84
00:12:59,319 --> 00:13:12,639
Joanna Kovacevich: The last tab here is a new instructional tools list and the idea here is to help you explore new tools that are available or how to use and what is what is some of these existing tools mean.

85
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:25,659
Joanna Kovacevich: So importing content to your course the U of m course manager tool which exists in the left hand menu of all canvas sites, what is that what does it do.

86
00:13:25,659 --> 00:13:39,099
Joanna Kovacevich: pinup dough some of our integrated tools yellow dig zoom poll everywhere here's where you can sort of learn more information and additional you can always contact us.

87
00:13:39,099 --> 00:13:53,559
Joanna Kovacevich: So we invite you to explore that and if you're looking for a new tool, these are some filtering and sorting categories if you're looking for something to help with accessibility for you're looking for any analytics tool.

88
00:13:53,559 --> 00:14:00,489
Joanna Kovacevich: If you're looking at for discussion and engagement tools, you can sort the list by those.

89
00:14:00,489 --> 00:14:06,759
Joanna Kovacevich: So we hope you find that useful.

90
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:16,629
Joanna Kovacevich: So what we'd like for you to be able to do is reference any of these oh my heading is broken I apologize.

91
00:14:16,629 --> 00:14:30,969
Joanna Kovacevich: Each of these jumps down to a different place on the document that provides instructions on how to do each of these so and then a way to when you get to the bottom of those instructions jump back to the top.

92
00:14:30,969 --> 00:14:36,969
Joanna Kovacevich: So, ideally, what you would be able to do is check these off as you go.

93
00:14:36,969 --> 00:14:47,889
Joanna Kovacevich: Now I want to go back and address some of your questions before we look at any of the additional items we have on our list in case.

94
00:14:47,889 --> 00:14:54,039
Joanna Kovacevich: they're not covered.

95
00:14:54,039 --> 00:15:09,219
Joanna Kovacevich: So let me just take a moment to read these brand new to everything under issues and then my recorded lectures on canvas last year are not showing up under this year's canvas they were under pinup dough recordings.

96
00:15:09,219 --> 00:15:20,499
Joanna Kovacevich: Yes, so pinata recordings from last year, do not get copied over automatically they.

97
00:15:20,499 --> 00:15:22,059
Joanna Kovacevich: They.

98
00:15:22,059 --> 00:15:36,279
Joanna Kovacevich: assume pinnacle sort of assumes that these videos were recorded for this class and to not share them, but I would be happy to show you how to.

99
00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:58,929
Joanna Kovacevich: share those again, because how you share them might be different, depending on how you have how you have them listed in your course, and so what I would suggest is maybe you could send us an email at SP H dot instruction that you mentioned EDU with the course.

100
00:15:58,929 --> 00:16:10,929
Joanna Kovacevich: ID number but canvas site, so we can help you get those either transferred or shared so that your students this year have access.

101
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:17,259
Joanna Kovacevich: Now i'm going to go over to questions and the refresh once more.

102
00:16:17,259 --> 00:16:34,359
Joanna Kovacevich: How do I record or backup my zoom and is there a deadline for me to do it so yes zoom recordings can now be backed up to.

103
00:16:34,359 --> 00:16:49,929
Joanna Kovacevich: Excellent data will be happy to look at those and help you get those setup so your zoom recordings that you made either this semester or last winter, those are stored in the zoom web portal.

104
00:16:49,929 --> 00:17:05,139
Joanna Kovacevich: For University of Michigan for 150 days before they are deleted and we often get emails saying you're the recording titled, this is about to be deleted, you can recover it by clicking here.

105
00:17:05,139 --> 00:17:15,819
Joanna Kovacevich: That slightly deceptive, because when you click the recover it really only recovers it again for a limited time.

106
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:26,019
Joanna Kovacevich: let's see if I have that in this checklist or if I need to reference my zoom.

107
00:17:26,019 --> 00:17:35,709
Joanna Kovacevich: So scheduled remote meetings with zoom.

108
00:17:35,709 --> 00:17:47,019
Joanna Kovacevich: Here we go this is in the resources, how to save zoom recordings to dropbox this is going to.

109
00:17:47,019 --> 00:17:59,949
Joanna Kovacevich: there's two options, you have, there is a step to transfer all of your existing zoom recordings that you have saved right now transfer them over to dropbox.

110
00:17:59,949 --> 00:18:09,699
Joanna Kovacevich: But then there's the second option to have all future zoom recordings automatically transferred to dropbox and I have my i've.

111
00:18:09,699 --> 00:18:26,919
Joanna Kovacevich: performed both of these steps on mine, so that I know I never worry about my zoom recordings being deleted so when those emails come and say you're meeting recording is about to be deleted, I don't worry about it because I know I have it, backed up and dropbox.

112
00:18:26,919 --> 00:18:36,579
Joanna Kovacevich: So i'm going to direct you to that and see you should be able to access this on the heights.

113
00:18:36,579 --> 00:18:43,089
Joanna Kovacevich: i'll post it here, so I have some steps there that you can perform.

114
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:52,779
Joanna Kovacevich: To make sure you're not losing your recordings because that's been a very common thing because of that recovering your recording.

115
00:18:52,779 --> 00:19:07,239
Joanna Kovacevich: Link really only recovers it for like one one more day and what they're doing is buying you an extra day to download it or get it out there and people often think by recovering it they're saving it forever.

116
00:19:07,239 --> 00:19:18,219
Joanna Kovacevich: The limitation of that 150 day that this was set at the university level, and it has to do with the secure data agreement and expectations that have been.

117
00:19:18,219 --> 00:19:23,169
Joanna Kovacevich: agreed upon between the university and zoom.

118
00:19:23,169 --> 00:19:29,379
Joanna Kovacevich: So we're not able to change that but I highly recommend the dropbox integration.

119
00:19:29,379 --> 00:19:42,489
Joanna Kovacevich: So your deadline is basically that 150 days, so if you come if you go to your zoom web portal.

120
00:19:42,489 --> 00:19:47,049
Joanna Kovacevich: and go to the recordings menu.

121
00:19:47,049 --> 00:20:00,549
Joanna Kovacevich: And if you've been recording to the cloud, these are the ones that are getting deleted if you've recorded anything locally, where it downloads the recording to your computer you're not at risk of losing it but here's your deadline auto delete in.

122
00:20:00,549 --> 00:20:04,269
Joanna Kovacevich: You see how it's counting down the days.

123
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:12,999
Joanna Kovacevich: So 44 days and i've got quite a bit more.

124
00:20:12,999 --> 00:20:18,039
Joanna Kovacevich: So, and my suggestion would be before you.

125
00:20:18,039 --> 00:20:38,439
Joanna Kovacevich: back up to dropbox come over to your trash this is included in the instructions, but come over to your trash and recover any of these that have already been moved to the trash so that you can also back those up.

126
00:20:38,439 --> 00:20:48,039
Joanna Kovacevich: Kate yes, you can it's not modifying your zoom setting basically what you're doing is you are setting up an integration.

127
00:20:48,039 --> 00:21:00,639
Joanna Kovacevich: Between your zoom account and your U of m dropbox account, and it will automatically copy all of your future zoom recordings to your dropbox without you having to do anything.

128
00:21:00,639 --> 00:21:16,779
Joanna Kovacevich: And so, this link I have right above here that directs to the heights has some instructions and I have those labeled as save all future zoom recordings to dropbox and there's just a few steps that only takes.

129
00:21:16,779 --> 00:21:31,779
Joanna Kovacevich: You know less than 10 minutes to just sort of like hit confirm okay login confirm so it's a great great feature.

130
00:21:31,779 --> 00:21:40,749
Joanna Kovacevich: will make old canvas quizzes work with the new quiz functionality, this is a great question because you may have seen the announcement that.

131
00:21:40,749 --> 00:21:47,529
Joanna Kovacevich: canvas is updating the quiz functionality to a tool that's currently called New quizzes.

132
00:21:47,529 --> 00:22:10,359
Joanna Kovacevich: And so, beginning starting two days ago anytime you go to create a new quiz you are all going to have an option to do you want to create this as a new quiz or use classic quizzes classic quizzes is now the name for the quiz tool we've had all the way up until now.

133
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:28,029
Joanna Kovacevich: You will continue to be able to utilize all of your existing quizzes the way they are until summer of 2023 leading up to that will be sharing some migration information.

134
00:22:28,029 --> 00:22:53,589
Joanna Kovacevich: And there are going to be some changes the biggest and most disappointing change will be the fact that the new quizzes tool will not be able to run surveys so i'll be sharing some specific information if you happen to you utilize the quiz tool in canvas as a survey collection option.

135
00:22:53,589 --> 00:23:00,189
Joanna Kovacevich: We unfortunately will need to change that as frustrating, as that is.

136
00:23:00,189 --> 00:23:03,909
Joanna Kovacevich: I do have a.

137
00:23:03,909 --> 00:23:08,919
Joanna Kovacevich: And this is available in the what's new in canvas.

138
00:23:08,919 --> 00:23:22,179
Joanna Kovacevich: i'm going to jump back to that because I have a mention of new quizzes and this comparison chart was created by canvas to show you what's going to be different.

139
00:23:22,179 --> 00:23:24,249
Joanna Kovacevich: So.

140
00:23:24,249 --> 00:23:34,029
Joanna Kovacevich: As you begin considering and exploring you might want to look and think about what are the what am I must have features and.

141
00:23:34,029 --> 00:23:46,569
Joanna Kovacevich: utilize this feature comparison guide to know if if you're in a place where you could transition to new quizzes or if you need to stay utilizing the classic quizzes so again classic is.

142
00:23:46,569 --> 00:24:04,899
Joanna Kovacevich: The quizzes the way we've always had it new quizzes is, if you were to create a new quiz today, these are the features that would have, and then they are trying to increase the amount of features they're doing some development work.

143
00:24:04,899 --> 00:24:07,059
Joanna Kovacevich: By that.

144
00:24:07,059 --> 00:24:11,679
Joanna Kovacevich: Summer of 2023 deadline and so these are items.

145
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:21,039
Joanna Kovacevich: That they look to add, and so let me go ahead and copy this.

146
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:38,229
Joanna Kovacevich: So you can peek at that just to begin to get a sense so search through here for any items that you really rely on quizzes for.

147
00:24:38,229 --> 00:24:45,129
Joanna Kovacevich: Anyone recommendation for file storage when courses have been copied.

148
00:24:45,129 --> 00:24:52,479
Joanna Kovacevich: For many semesters.

149
00:24:52,479 --> 00:24:58,809
Joanna Kovacevich: This is a good question because that files area in your course.

150
00:24:58,809 --> 00:25:10,089
Joanna Kovacevich: When we copy import semester after semester it starts getting really messy and disorganized and.

151
00:25:10,089 --> 00:25:24,159
Joanna Kovacevich: And the hard part is it's really difficult to go through and sort of tease out what you need and what you don't need it's a lot of work to go through and delete everything.

152
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:44,199
Joanna Kovacevich: What you could do is there is an option to download everything you haven't files, so if you wanted sort of a zip file archive of everything so that you could go through and start deleting everything you could download that to your computer and move it to Google drive or dropbox.

153
00:25:44,199 --> 00:25:48,489
Joanna Kovacevich: Just so you're not losing anything.

154
00:25:48,489 --> 00:25:58,629
Joanna Kovacevich: If you are hitting your storage CAP please contact us at SP H dot instruction or send a note to us.

155
00:25:58,629 --> 00:26:04,089
Joanna Kovacevich: At the using the link at the top of the checklist because we can help.

156
00:26:04,089 --> 00:26:07,659
Joanna Kovacevich: You.

157
00:26:07,659 --> 00:26:23,679
Joanna Kovacevich: We can sort of increase your limit if you need that extra space to get through until you can reorganize something else to think about is that if you have video files in your file canvas files area.

158
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:28,299
Joanna Kovacevich: I would ask you to consider moving those two Pinatubo.

159
00:26:28,299 --> 00:26:41,079
Joanna Kovacevich: So before the pandemic, we often talked about panoptic as a recording what's happening in my class what's what's recording what's happening in the lecture Hall, or in the classroom.

160
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:48,039
Joanna Kovacevich: But perhaps we can actually do a lot more than that you can many of you pre recorded lecture content.

161
00:26:48,039 --> 00:27:06,129
Joanna Kovacevich: for students to view in advance of coming to the zoom meeting and discussing when we were fully remote, but you can also take video clips and upload them so say maybe you have some video clips from the textbook publisher or you recorded some lab videos.

162
00:27:06,129 --> 00:27:24,309
Joanna Kovacevich: During the pandemic as aids to help students during their lab work, you can go in and record or i'm sorry upload those video files that you already have and the nice thing about doing that, is there is a way to apply automated captions to panoptic videos.

163
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:43,689
Joanna Kovacevich: Because we want to think about accessibility videos that are that exist in the canvas files area we can't automatically apply captions we would have to get the video captioned in a different tool and then upload the caption file.

164
00:27:43,689 --> 00:27:52,509
Joanna Kovacevich: And so it's some extra work but video files also fill up the canvas storage pretty quickly.

165
00:27:52,509 --> 00:28:04,749
Joanna Kovacevich: So we will be happy to consult with you on that or help you with the file the files area limit if you're hitting that storage limits.

166
00:28:04,749 --> 00:28:21,069
Joanna Kovacevich: Not currently teaching no problem, some of these things are just good to know that are available, and so I appreciate you coming today how do I set up a meeting for Class great question and I have this covered in the.

167
00:28:21,069 --> 00:28:26,829
Joanna Kovacevich: checklist document so schedule remote class meetings with zoom.

168
00:28:26,829 --> 00:28:35,379
Joanna Kovacevich: And just for this purpose, so here's all the written instructions, with a few screenshots but i'll go ahead and jump over to my.

169
00:28:35,379 --> 00:28:38,799
Joanna Kovacevich: site here.

170
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:44,019
Joanna Kovacevich: One last comment about this.

171
00:28:44,019 --> 00:28:54,879
Joanna Kovacevich: template we've applied, this is a currently applied as your homepage so let me take a step back just briefly.

172
00:28:54,879 --> 00:29:09,399
Joanna Kovacevich: And let you know that we've provided instructions for how to switch that back to your own homepage for your course, so let me jump back to the top what's on the course homepage.

173
00:29:09,399 --> 00:29:30,249
Joanna Kovacevich: I have a link to a set your course homepage after you've imported your content or you're starting to build the content in your course you'll need to change that from being the template page to whatever your designated course home pages and that's a real quick step.

174
00:29:30,249 --> 00:29:32,769
Joanna Kovacevich: Of.

175
00:29:32,769 --> 00:29:40,719
Joanna Kovacevich: going to the pages area.

176
00:29:40,719 --> 00:29:52,149
Joanna Kovacevich: clicking the view all pages button in the upper left corner and notice this template getting started has this little flag on it that says front page.

177
00:29:52,149 --> 00:30:00,939
Joanna Kovacevich: But this is the homepage that I really want to use I can come over.

178
00:30:00,939 --> 00:30:07,449
Joanna Kovacevich: To the three dots apologize, some of my menus are.

179
00:30:07,449 --> 00:30:12,069
Joanna Kovacevich: The three dot menu on the far right.

180
00:30:12,069 --> 00:30:21,549
Joanna Kovacevich: And there is a US as front page button and now you can see that little tag that says front page has switched.

181
00:30:21,549 --> 00:30:34,509
Joanna Kovacevich: And if I hit the home button now, this is what I intend to be my course homepage so I just wanted to show you that really quickly.

182
00:30:34,509 --> 00:30:37,809
Joanna Kovacevich: scheduling zoom meetings.

183
00:30:37,809 --> 00:30:52,269
Joanna Kovacevich: So you want to make sure the zoom menu is enabled in your course we have applied this in the template the course template but if by chance that got moved or removed.

184
00:30:52,269 --> 00:30:58,419
Joanna Kovacevich: I believe we have some information on how to enable that.

185
00:30:58,419 --> 00:31:02,409
Joanna Kovacevich: it's good to remote class meetings with zoom.

186
00:31:02,409 --> 00:31:15,189
Joanna Kovacevich: Yes, so enable it from the settings menu, and there is a tip to help you locate how to turn that on and add it to your course menu if you don't see it here.

187
00:31:15,189 --> 00:31:24,669
Joanna Kovacevich: When I click on that if you're clicking on it for the first time there might be an authorization step to merge your U of m canvas account with your U of m zoom account.

188
00:31:24,669 --> 00:31:36,909
Joanna Kovacevich: The first tab here is upcoming meetings and so it's a fresh semester, so I don't have anything yet, but in over on the right, I have a button to schedule a new meeting.

189
00:31:36,909 --> 00:31:52,809
Joanna Kovacevich: And this is going to allow you to set the name the date and the time and then, if it's a weekly if you're meeting remotely every week or twice a week, you can enable that here a recurring meeting.

190
00:31:52,809 --> 00:31:55,989
Joanna Kovacevich: You can set your security.

191
00:31:55,989 --> 00:31:58,539
Joanna Kovacevich: Setting.

192
00:31:58,539 --> 00:32:06,369
Joanna Kovacevich: Pass code, this is a pass code that will you'll need to share with your students, you can utilize the waiting room.

193
00:32:06,369 --> 00:32:17,589
Joanna Kovacevich: or even said it to only authenticated users can join this means students would need to be logging into zoom with their.

194
00:32:17,589 --> 00:32:37,869
Joanna Kovacevich: Signed into their U of m zoom account, and so this is something you would want to allow extra time in advance and provide some instructions to make sure that they have activated their zoom account by going to umesh that zoom that EDU if you decide to enable that.

195
00:32:37,869 --> 00:32:49,209
Joanna Kovacevich: i've switched my zoom meeting default to apply a pass Code, the waiting room, we found in a couple of classes, is once we're in screen share mode.

196
00:32:49,209 --> 00:33:00,999
Joanna Kovacevich: It can be easy to miss those notifications that there's somebody waiting in the waiting room so sometimes students who joined late once we've already gotten started or maybe they.

197
00:33:00,999 --> 00:33:09,759
Joanna Kovacevich: Their connection was weak and they got kicked out of the meeting, and they rejoined but now they're stuck in the waiting room like in the middle of class.

198
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:16,389
Joanna Kovacevich: So, just a quick word of warning there.

199
00:33:16,389 --> 00:33:20,259
Joanna Kovacevich: And then you can also set your.

200
00:33:20,259 --> 00:33:24,459
Joanna Kovacevich: All of your class meetings to record automatically.

201
00:33:24,459 --> 00:33:30,579
Joanna Kovacevich: So that they get recorded and published back to the canvas site.

202
00:33:30,579 --> 00:33:46,419
Joanna Kovacevich: One word of warning there is that I would suggest not enable join before host and record the meeting automatically, I would say either or because what happens here is students will click on the link.

203
00:33:46,419 --> 00:34:02,859
Joanna Kovacevich: And because they joined because somebody joined the meeting it automatically begins recording and then sometimes you'll have if you have a large class you'll have 10 little you know one minute recordings where someone was really just trying to test the link and not generate a recording.

204
00:34:02,859 --> 00:34:15,819
Joanna Kovacevich: So you know you could do it like that, or you could decide, maybe we're not recording every session and and you can remember to enable that recording.

205
00:34:15,819 --> 00:34:33,759
Joanna Kovacevich: And then alternative host if you have a GSA or ta how it's just go ahead and add them as an alternative host that way they'll have the permissions they may need to assist you during the canvas session so you'd click save here.

206
00:34:33,759 --> 00:34:37,899
Joanna Kovacevich: When you click save you have some poll information.

207
00:34:37,899 --> 00:34:43,029
Joanna Kovacevich: If you want to add poll questions.

208
00:34:43,029 --> 00:34:49,119
Joanna Kovacevich: And then, when I back out notice, I have one upcoming meeting here, and I can start it.

209
00:34:49,119 --> 00:35:07,389
Joanna Kovacevich: If i'm recording setting my meetings to record to the cloud, they will appear in a list here under the cloud recordings tab by default they're unpublished so students will not be able to see these until you come in here and click the slider.

210
00:35:07,389 --> 00:35:21,789
Joanna Kovacevich: So it'll give you a chance to preview the recording see if there's anything you need to make adjustments to before you publish it for them to see.

211
00:35:21,789 --> 00:35:32,799
Joanna Kovacevich: there's one question in the chat that I want to make sure I don't miss is there a way to do surveys in canvas currently, yes, but it's going to be removed.

212
00:35:32,799 --> 00:35:43,539
Joanna Kovacevich: Long term so i'm not sure you would want to do it unless you're Okay, with just doing it this semester currently be quizzes tool.

213
00:35:43,539 --> 00:35:47,949
Joanna Kovacevich: When you create a new quiz.

214
00:35:47,949 --> 00:35:54,699
Joanna Kovacevich: Using classic quizzes again, which is going away.

215
00:35:54,699 --> 00:36:03,789
Joanna Kovacevich: You have the option to set this as a graded survey or upgraded survey.

216
00:36:03,789 --> 00:36:12,729
Joanna Kovacevich: But I would say, you know I wouldn't want you to get used to having this available because they are removing it it s is looking at.

217
00:36:12,729 --> 00:36:16,809
Joanna Kovacevich: replacing it with a quality tricks integration.

218
00:36:16,809 --> 00:36:21,429
Joanna Kovacevich: So I think your best options are to put a.

219
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:32,799
Joanna Kovacevich: Google survey link in your course or a call tricks survey link if you're more comfortable using all tricks.

220
00:36:32,799 --> 00:36:44,169
Joanna Kovacevich: How does canvas interact with yellow dig yellow dig is a newer discussion tool and we've had a few workshops on that.

221
00:36:44,169 --> 00:36:49,539
Joanna Kovacevich: And let's see from the.

222
00:36:49,539 --> 00:36:54,069
Joanna Kovacevich: canvas course checklist page.

223
00:36:54,069 --> 00:37:06,129
Joanna Kovacevich: down here at the bottom, I have a note to try something new explorer instructional tools list and yellow dig is in that list.

224
00:37:06,129 --> 00:37:10,119
Joanna Kovacevich: And we've put together a lot of resources.

225
00:37:10,119 --> 00:37:18,249
Joanna Kovacevich: on how to thinking about how it's used, and we have a sample yellow dig assignment that you can come and try.

226
00:37:18,249 --> 00:37:38,229
Joanna Kovacevich: In our resilient teaching site which is sort of an instructor playground, and we have some get started with yellow to get information and then a link information you could share with your students, basically, what yellow do will do is integrate with your canvas gradebook.

227
00:37:38,229 --> 00:37:55,779
Joanna Kovacevich: We can set yellow dig up as an assignment so students can earn a grade in the gradebook for their participation and yellow dig and it's basically like a social media feed think of it as maybe a Facebook group for your class.

228
00:37:55,779 --> 00:37:59,949
Joanna Kovacevich: and students can.

229
00:37:59,949 --> 00:38:15,999
Joanna Kovacevich: Make posts, they can share article links, they can record or link to videos and other students can react to those with emojis reply as questions so there's a lot of ways that you could.

230
00:38:15,999 --> 00:38:18,009
Joanna Kovacevich: Create.

231
00:38:18,009 --> 00:38:34,479
Joanna Kovacevich: Engagement opportunities using yellow duck or use yellow dig to enhance the engagement activities you already have in your class, for instance, if you have a weekly discussion board yellow because a tool that might help live in that up a little bit.

232
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:48,699
Joanna Kovacevich: And so we have a link to a whole training session that also included some thoughts and feedback and experiences of those who've been using it to instructors who used it in their classes fall and then.

233
00:38:48,699 --> 00:38:59,829
Joanna Kovacevich: One program administrator that is using it as a poster session a virtual poster session environment so we'd welcome you to.

234
00:38:59,829 --> 00:39:03,159
Joanna Kovacevich: view that.

235
00:39:03,159 --> 00:39:11,289
Joanna Kovacevich: i'll try to link that on this page, but from the resilient teaching home if you've come to the workshops tab across the top.

236
00:39:11,289 --> 00:39:14,589
Joanna Kovacevich: We did this follow the yellow brick road.

237
00:39:14,589 --> 00:39:18,819
Joanna Kovacevich: workshop and here's the recording of it.

238
00:39:18,819 --> 00:39:25,149
Joanna Kovacevich: we're also having a part two, yellow did workshop where we're actually going to work, one on one.

239
00:39:25,149 --> 00:39:46,779
Joanna Kovacevich: Helping instructors or anyone who's interested in setting up the led Community actually configure it for the purpose, you want, and so as students interact in yellow dig in this discussion, environment, they will grade will be passed back to the great book.

240
00:39:46,779 --> 00:40:01,779
Joanna Kovacevich: So students actually earn points in yellow dig for the activities and the engagement that they participate in and then that is pass back to your great book.

241
00:40:01,779 --> 00:40:12,489
Joanna Kovacevich: And then, how do I enable life transcript and zoom that's a great question.

242
00:40:12,489 --> 00:40:15,009
Joanna Kovacevich: I me.

243
00:40:15,009 --> 00:40:21,939
Joanna Kovacevich: wonder if I have a knowledge article on that.

244
00:40:21,939 --> 00:40:33,759
Joanna Kovacevich: Let me see if i've put anything in here.

245
00:40:33,759 --> 00:40:44,409
Joanna Kovacevich: So let's see if this zoom meeting accessibility document.

246
00:40:44,409 --> 00:41:01,719
Joanna Kovacevich: So technology this yes exactly good, this is what we want, enabled live transcription so let me put this link in here.

247
00:41:01,719 --> 00:41:09,039
Joanna Kovacevich: But accessibility during our live zoom sessions is is important.

248
00:41:09,039 --> 00:41:26,979
Joanna Kovacevich: And one comment that's come up is, can I just set all of my zoom meetings to have live transcript enabled by default and my hope is that that will be an option at some point, unfortunately it's not yet.

249
00:41:26,979 --> 00:41:40,599
Joanna Kovacevich: That would be ideal just to say always apply it without me having to manually set that up.

250
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:45,579
Joanna Kovacevich: So I hope that helps so that was located under the resources.

251
00:41:45,579 --> 00:41:58,719
Joanna Kovacevich: Under the header of schedule remote class meetings with zoom.

252
00:41:58,719 --> 00:42:03,399
Joanna Kovacevich: Thank you for these wonderful questions.

253
00:42:03,399 --> 00:42:09,699
Joanna Kovacevich: What else in the last 10 minutes, would you like to see.

254
00:42:09,699 --> 00:42:29,769
Joanna Kovacevich: or other questions that have come up.

255
00:42:29,769 --> 00:42:35,829
Joanna Kovacevich: While we're waiting for you to type anything in here.

256
00:42:35,829 --> 00:42:39,879
Joanna Kovacevich: What i'd like to do, and you can go ahead and put these in the chat.

257
00:42:39,879 --> 00:42:46,839
Joanna Kovacevich: i'm going to close this idea boards, because I don't want to miss when make sure I don't miss any.

258
00:42:46,839 --> 00:42:51,789
Joanna Kovacevich: While we're waiting i'm going to show you some things that.

259
00:42:51,789 --> 00:43:00,399
Joanna Kovacevich: I want, I want to make sure you know about so some of these are just.

260
00:43:00,399 --> 00:43:12,549
Joanna Kovacevich: lesser known features so Dana does a new yellow the Community need to be set up for each new semester, it depends on how you're using it if you were using it for a.

261
00:43:12,549 --> 00:43:21,999
Joanna Kovacevich: A class that is just meets for one semester, or maybe if you're setting it up for a year long Program.

262
00:43:21,999 --> 00:43:26,139
Joanna Kovacevich: We can extend the dates.

263
00:43:26,139 --> 00:43:35,799
Joanna Kovacevich: So I hope that helps if you're integrating it with the great book I don't know how that would work, we need to look at that if you're extending it across maybe two courses.

264
00:43:35,799 --> 00:43:39,369
Joanna Kovacevich: But there is the possibility of having.

265
00:43:39,369 --> 00:43:57,729
Joanna Kovacevich: You know, a year long or a two year long cohort yellow did Community so there's some flexibility any yellow to Community that is not set up to integrate with a specific canvas course our team actually needs to set it up so.

266
00:43:57,729 --> 00:44:05,139
Joanna Kovacevich: Yes, so if you're starting fresh and it's assignment, it needs to integrate with the gradebook and it's not something that's spanning maybe a year long.

267
00:44:05,139 --> 00:44:17,979
Joanna Kovacevich: project or your long activity you'll want to create a new and set up a new yellow dig environment, but if you've done special things like setups specific.

268
00:44:17,979 --> 00:44:35,229
Joanna Kovacevich: Special accolades or topic tags in your yellow dig community that you want to reuse, there is a way you can copy your settings from a previous year if that's have any interest in, I will be happy to.

269
00:44:35,229 --> 00:44:43,029
Joanna Kovacevich: Excellent yeah that'll save you that time of naming your topics all over again.

270
00:44:43,029 --> 00:44:46,899
Joanna Kovacevich: So one of the things I would love to show you.

271
00:44:46,899 --> 00:45:08,499
Joanna Kovacevich: Our one feature that in case you don't know is there, you can clear out all your old assignment dates and set up all your new assignment dates in actually one screen if if you want, so let me jump over to those instructions.

272
00:45:08,499 --> 00:45:20,439
Joanna Kovacevich: When you're on the assignments menu, and in the upper right hand corner there's the three dot menu and anytime there's a three dot menu, that means there's more options available.

273
00:45:20,439 --> 00:45:35,679
Joanna Kovacevich: If you click on that there is now a menu item that says edit assignment dates and i'll go ahead and DEMO this in my practice site.

274
00:45:35,679 --> 00:45:41,769
Joanna Kovacevich: This lists all of my assignments that have due dates.

275
00:45:41,769 --> 00:46:02,019
Joanna Kovacevich: And so, if I accidentally copied over old due dates from last semester it's no problem at all, because I can come up here to the top checklist to select everything in this list, most of mine don't because it's the practice site.

276
00:46:02,019 --> 00:46:06,579
Joanna Kovacevich: And there's a batch edit button.

277
00:46:06,579 --> 00:46:12,609
Joanna Kovacevich: And so it will give you a chance to shift these dates.

278
00:46:12,609 --> 00:46:28,029
Joanna Kovacevich: Or, I can remove the dates completely and just start fresh, so I can remove the due dates and the availability dates clear everything so that I can go through my syllabus and set beads how I need them.

279
00:46:28,029 --> 00:46:40,059
Joanna Kovacevich: i'm going to hit cancel but you would want to hit OK, and then here, I can go down the list and set due dates new due dates for all these assignments.

280
00:46:40,059 --> 00:46:57,279
Joanna Kovacevich: And so, a lot of times you know I see instructors naming things week one week two week three so that would be an easy way for you to track what order, all of these go in and then, once you've made changes the blue save button will activate.

281
00:46:57,279 --> 00:47:00,039
Joanna Kovacevich: And then that will all be applied.

282
00:47:00,039 --> 00:47:08,499
Joanna Kovacevich: So I just think that's such a nice batch tool they've been dead.

283
00:47:08,499 --> 00:47:15,909
Joanna Kovacevich: scroll back up.

284
00:47:15,909 --> 00:47:18,069
Joanna Kovacevich: I have some.

285
00:47:18,069 --> 00:47:26,169
Joanna Kovacevich: Steps on how to make sure your gradebook is organized that I would suggest that you take a look at.

286
00:47:26,169 --> 00:47:35,259
Joanna Kovacevich: Organized organizing your menu I have information about setting up put up the recordings, which we have a training session coming up on two training sessions coming up on.

287
00:47:35,259 --> 00:47:44,439
Joanna Kovacevich: And then consider enabling student facing analytics the University has developed a tool called my learning analytics That gives you some options.

288
00:47:44,439 --> 00:47:58,329
Joanna Kovacevich: Of analytics for students to be able to see about their own performance and how they're how how they're doing compared to their peers, but in ways that.

289
00:47:58,329 --> 00:48:02,229
Joanna Kovacevich: are less sort of.

290
00:48:02,229 --> 00:48:19,449
Joanna Kovacevich: Points pointed students can see Oh, the people who are doing this getting a's in class they've reviewed all these materials and things like that I provide a lot more information here and there's a DEMO video you can look at if you'd like to do that.

291
00:48:19,449 --> 00:48:26,979
Joanna Kovacevich: We have a great tool integrated with canvas called you do it that will scan the items you've.

292
00:48:26,979 --> 00:48:34,269
Joanna Kovacevich: The pages in your course and your assignments for accessibility, I recommend you explore that.

293
00:48:34,269 --> 00:48:45,369
Joanna Kovacevich: And just to know just because we tend to copy our sites from Semester to semester I highly recommend using the run link validator.

294
00:48:45,369 --> 00:49:00,429
Joanna Kovacevich: So this shows how to do this and i'll DEMO it really quickly in my site because it's hidden under the settings menu, which is the last menu in the left hand navigation.

295
00:49:00,429 --> 00:49:15,549
Joanna Kovacevich: And this validate links and content it's going to scan now, it will scan the items, you have in your files like if you have pdfs or like your syllabus word documents it doesn't scan those but anywhere, you have.

296
00:49:15,549 --> 00:49:30,039
Joanna Kovacevich: Your page links your home homepage your class meeting your assignments, if you have links that are no longer working it's going to catch them so that you can correct those before your students run into them.

297
00:49:30,039 --> 00:49:39,969
Joanna Kovacevich: So I highly recommend utilizing that tool.

298
00:49:39,969 --> 00:49:49,299
Joanna Kovacevich: i'd also like to encourage you all to consider creating a course tour, and this is basically creating a screen cast video.

299
00:49:49,299 --> 00:50:01,719
Joanna Kovacevich: showing your students how you've set up your course and our motivation for recommending this goes back to a lot of that student feedback about course navigation.

300
00:50:01,719 --> 00:50:10,809
Joanna Kovacevich: Things were organized really well I always knew where to find the information I needed and then, on the other end of the spectrum, we heard a lot of.

301
00:50:10,809 --> 00:50:27,279
Joanna Kovacevich: You know, is there a way that you could force menu items to be in a particular order, because each of my classes is organized in a different way and I feel like it takes, I have to go searching for what I need because everything's in a different order.

302
00:50:27,279 --> 00:50:37,569
Joanna Kovacevich: And so, one way, we could help students know right from the beginning of i'm going to put all your assignment documents here.

303
00:50:37,569 --> 00:50:49,119
Joanna Kovacevich: i'm going to have all of your readings shared here you'll be able to know what's coming up do from this area, and so, in order to help you do that.

304
00:50:49,119 --> 00:51:01,299
Joanna Kovacevich: we've created a sample video and this create a campus tour document is links out to a Google document where we've actually provided a script template for you.

305
00:51:01,299 --> 00:51:10,719
Joanna Kovacevich: And we've outlined what we consider to be the main things that you can demonstrate, and you can record this using pinup dough.

306
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:30,069
Joanna Kovacevich: If you're a MAC user, you can use quicktime player on your computer and upload it to open up doe you can record it with zoom if you're more comfortable and then upload that recording or share the link if that's something you're more comfortable with but we'd ask you to consider that.

307
00:51:30,069 --> 00:51:40,149
Joanna Kovacevich: So I hope you find this checklist helpful as a guide to help you make sure you've dotted all your i's and cross all your t's.

308
00:51:40,149 --> 00:51:45,879
Joanna Kovacevich: We are available always for questions and assistance.

309
00:51:45,879 --> 00:51:51,609
Joanna Kovacevich: And we just wanted to let you know about a couple of our upcoming training opportunities so.

310
00:51:51,609 --> 00:52:00,399
Joanna Kovacevich: we're offering two sessions of classroom recording with Panopticon One of those is on the.

311
00:52:00,399 --> 00:52:11,199
Joanna Kovacevich: Next week, December 15, and these are happening in the building, so that you can actually see how the equipment is set up, and you can also get some hands on time.

312
00:52:11,199 --> 00:52:23,319
Joanna Kovacevich: i'll leave some hands on time, so if you're planning to come to campus for the end of year celebration consider coming in our early for the classroom recording with panoptic demonstration.

313
00:52:23,319 --> 00:52:35,439
Joanna Kovacevich: i'll be offering a second one of these sessions again here in the building, but also having the option to participate remotely if you need to happy to accommodate that.

314
00:52:35,439 --> 00:52:46,689
Joanna Kovacevich: The next one will do on January 4 so the week that classes starts in case you'd rather do it when it's really fresh in your memory to start your classes.

315
00:52:46,689 --> 00:52:54,159
Joanna Kovacevich: And, as I mentioned we're doing a follow the yellow brick road part to let us help you configure yellow dig for your course.

316
00:52:54,159 --> 00:53:06,309
Joanna Kovacevich: And we're doing that on Friday, the 17th so at the end of next week and yeah if you have any interest at all, please feel free to register for any of these sessions.

317
00:53:06,309 --> 00:53:18,849
Joanna Kovacevich: We won't i'll record classroom recording with pinata we won't be recording the yellow dig one just because this is a follow up to the workshop and because we'll just be doing one on one consulting.

318
00:53:18,849 --> 00:53:31,329
Joanna Kovacevich: But let me copy that link, because you can locate these and register on the SP H events calendar.

319
00:53:31,329 --> 00:53:36,849
Joanna Kovacevich: So I want to thank you all for coming and spending this time.

320
00:53:36,849 --> 00:53:53,829
Joanna Kovacevich: hearing me talk about canvas I could probably go on for hours about all the little hidden things that are available that are nice to know about when you're using canvas, but we do encourage you to reach out to us.

321
00:53:53,829 --> 00:54:04,869
Joanna Kovacevich: At any time as you're preparing once you get started, whenever and then, of course, as you're wrapping up this semester, if anything, comes up that you need assistance with.

322
00:54:04,869 --> 00:54:16,929
Joanna Kovacevich: We would be more than happy to support you in that as well.

323
00:54:16,929 --> 00:54:23,889
Joanna Kovacevich: Thank you, you are free to go Thank you again for coming.

324
00:54:23,889 --> 00:54:29,255
Joanna Kovacevich: And i'll go ahead and stop that recording.
