1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:04,540
I'm Josh. And you are. Awesome.

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:13,440
We're glad to interview you for that. So, I mean, there's a lot of positions open and I'm sure even a blind left hander have a lot of opportunities.

3
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:16,900
Why are you interested in this position specifically? Okay.

4
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:25,830
In particular, I am interested in this position because I feel like with my prior experience in

5
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:32,340
research and also a little bit of experience working in a consulting company,

6
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:43,920
I feel like I can amalgamate both these experiences together and be able to give a broader perspective towards understanding

7
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:59,310
current environmental or public health issues and just be able to help and support our clients or companies and,

8
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:08,770
you know, create that good. Thank you.

9
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:17,770
Hopefully just create a good environment and help come up with solutions that help.

10
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:26,870
Flourished. Awesome. So what would you say are some of your strengths and weaknesses?

11
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:36,010
Some of my strengths would be that I am very detail oriented and I make sure that whatever task that I have,

12
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:40,729
I'm being provided with, I make sure that I do it properly.

13
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:46,670
And I'm also very adaptable and always willing to learn new things.

14
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:52,969
So I'm, I, I don't believe in restricting myself to just one field of work.

15
00:01:52,970 --> 00:02:04,300
I'm always open to expanding my horizons and learning a lot of new things of weakness that kind of branches out of that.

16
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:09,889
That very same strength of mine is that I tend to take up a lot of responsibilities and overwhelm

17
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:15,570
myself with the work which ultimately ends up affecting my work life balance that sometimes.

18
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:24,859
But I am working on that by learning how to prioritize things and get all the important

19
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:32,030
tasks done first and at the same time also make sure that I am looking after my kids.

20
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,700
Now we've received a lot of applicants. And why should we hire you over on their efforts?

21
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:46,270
All right. So more than anything, at a job, you know, working,

22
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:55,540
it's one of the most important things is the is how well your passion for the work sustains throughout.

23
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:07,299
And I feel like I can definitely contribute to that because my whole life I've always been associated with within the field of like life sciences.

24
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:20,770
And I have explored different fields within the same but in the same sphere of just biology and human health and environmental health.

25
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:32,290
And I feel like I can contribute well to this particular company by just blending all these experiences together and hopefully build my passion

26
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:45,880
while working for this company and ultimately be able to come up with my own strategies and beliefs to help improve an environmental health,

27
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:53,290
which I think is something that is involved in literally everything that we do.

28
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,050
It's just that people don't realize it that much.

29
00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:03,940
And I'm here to make people realize that, and I feel like that's why I would be a good fit for this position.

30
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,540
Awesome to start tomorrow. Yeah.

31
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:11,350
I can serve you.

32
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:12,790
All right.
