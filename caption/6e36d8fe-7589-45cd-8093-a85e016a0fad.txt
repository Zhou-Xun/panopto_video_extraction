1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:05,430
So let's get the data to where it is.

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:12,030
Somewhere right here. Right now it's working.

3
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:24,540
And I think, again, I could have, as you can tell, very.

4
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:42,930
Okay. Okay.

5
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:51,660
I can have your attention, I think, very gently. And, you know, like, why do you suppose I'm just different?

6
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:54,960
Oh, we're all similar. Okay, everyone.

7
00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:03,920
Um, so Emily and I are both on the HSA, and we wanted to share with you an upcoming auction opportunity that we're all right.

8
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:14,400
The board is starting up, so students, faculty and staff are able to donate items and submit items for the auction.

9
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:21,960
And it's just going to be a fundraiser to help support our movement and everyone in our department.

10
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:31,259
Um, and you'll get a better idea of the type of solutions that we're looking for, for donations for the auction on Wednesday,

11
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:40,980
when we're going to release the form or deciding what to do or how to the mainstream auction, for example.

12
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:47,890
I think one of the items that you can is going to donate to auction is very happy hours.

13
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:53,490
You can buy the first thing you can appetizer for anyone who wants them for that.

14
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:59,819
So just this little head of what we're going to do for the party and what we're

15
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:06,790
more likely is three or four people in the audience that are only epidemiologists.

16
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:18,000
Get out of here while I. You can pretend to be able to exclude them so they don't have any questions.

17
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:23,820
All right. Thank you for the time.

18
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:35,680
Okay. Good afternoon, everybody. We're going to spend the session and a little bit of magic talking about heavy metals.

19
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:41,800
And has anybody looked at the readings for the session of metals here?

20
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:50,230
Anybody look at them, the articles. Okay, just one or two, maybe two articles.

21
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:57,070
One deals with with mostly low level effects of lead in adults,

22
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:09,549
and partly because we don't typically see the effects of very high exposures these days, but it does review high as well as low level exposures.

23
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:15,100
And the other article is by the pediatrician, the lead author, the pediatrician from Flint,

24
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:20,680
who sort of broke the story about the high lead levels in children in Flint.

25
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:31,870
And so that article is really a great article for many, many reasons because it really illustrates multiple issues,

26
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:36,070
not just about what does exposure to the lead cause,

27
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:44,050
but when we talk about reproductive and developmental effects, it's it's a classic description of that.

28
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:53,860
It's a description in terms of disparities because of the exposures tend to be among those who are most disadvantaged.

29
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,909
And so it's really a good article as everybody is following this story.

30
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:02,350
Is that right? Yeah, everybody, you can't not follow the story.

31
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:10,750
Even if you read the newspaper, who gets a newspaper? Who knows a lot above the fold means.

32
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,040
You still know what that means? It's sort of like trending, right?

33
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:21,280
Which means if the newspapers are stacked here, if it's above the fold on the front page, you see it.

34
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:24,280
Even just walking by, even if you don't read the paper. Right.

35
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:34,510
So this is two days ago in The New York Times, and this is, I think, the third front page article about Flint and lead and the water supply.

36
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:39,430
And so it's it's not just stayed national.

37
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:42,880
It's actually international news. And I think in terms of a case study,

38
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:51,550
it's is a perfect time to spend a lot of time reading and listening to the radio and so forth and following the stories on this.

39
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:04,220
And you can see just from this slide here that medals in general are important in terms of, in this case, hazardous waste site.

40
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:10,560
So some general discussion about medals and then we'll talk about individual ones.

41
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:18,240
First of all, led typically with medals, not always, but in many cases, the exposure,

42
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:23,490
especially occupational, is by inhalation, either particulate or fume.

43
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:28,710
There's also exposure, of course, by contaminated water or food.

44
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:39,060
And another thing about Flint that you'll see is that the amount of absorption can vary depending on who is being exposed.

45
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:47,620
There can be skin absorption. It tends to be organic find metals, for example, dimethyl mercury.

46
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:59,499
I'll tell a quick story about that. Once it's in the blood, there's various distribution patterns depending on the particular metal,

47
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:06,280
but also the form that the metal takes, whether it's a salt, whether it's organic or not, and so forth.

48
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:17,020
And also excretion can vary. Lots of metals have impacts on the kidneys, which filter the blood to make urine so we can get rid of waste products.

49
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,540
I just heard about Kyle, and I think that's been in the news as well.

50
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:28,540
All of this stuff is kind of relevant for what's going on in Flint. People want to know about Kilbarchan.

51
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,930
So there are materials, medicines, if you will.

52
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,240
Chemicals that can be ingested,

53
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:48,020
can be administered to a person that will bind to a heavy metal and form a stable compound that is easy to excrete and has preferably low toxicity.

54
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:57,620
A number of agents had to have been used in the past, and currently there are also times when when practitioners are using key location to remove,

55
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:07,760
for example, low levels of metals that aren't demonstrated to be toxic at those levels and wouldn't warrant collation.

56
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:18,320
So for example, in children, the evidence is that levels are lower than 40 or 40 or 45 or so have not been demonstrated to have a beneficial impact.

57
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:22,180
So in those cases, you wouldn't want to keightley.

58
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:27,880
So let's jump in and talk about lead and power.

59
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:35,590
Anybody wonder why PB Is the is the abbreviation for lead on the periodic table?

60
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:40,680
WILL It's the Latin for for plumb, which you can see is where we get the word hammer.

61
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:48,310
It's a great metal for a lot of reasons and for for good reasons why it's been used for so long.

62
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:58,210
Even even physicians have used LED compounds for medical treatment in the past.

63
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:07,720
And you'll see that pattern with a number of heavy metals where we used to use metals for what we thought was beneficial treatment.

64
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:17,480
This is a treatise by a Greek physician discredits who worked for the Romans in the time of Nero.

65
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:26,800
And it's interesting that this thing that he wrote was hidden in publication for about 1500 years,

66
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:32,110
and this is a quote from one of his volumes led makes the mind give way.

67
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:40,840
And to be fair, though, so we knew about lead and in its effect on the central nervous system even 2000 years ago.

68
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:47,470
But to be fair, this is probably based on high level exposure, extreme levels of toxicity,

69
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:54,310
not just subtle subclinical effects that we know today and only in recent decades.

70
00:08:55,300 --> 00:09:00,850
So a little bit about lead or is that it comes from the fact that some salts are soluble,

71
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:06,990
some are not, which would have importance with respect to distribution.

72
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,709
There's a number of heavy metals that have no value in the body.

73
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:15,730
There are no have no biological use, and lead is is one of them.

74
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:24,970
But, of course, we've contaminated our environment significantly because of the various ways we've used lead and disposed of it.

75
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:35,760
Just some examples of occupational uses and exposures that you can just look at radiators.

76
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:42,450
There was a company in Canton that 15 years ago I was doing LED surveillance

77
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:48,150
on them because they were they were using LED and dipping radiators and led.

78
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:57,450
And then they'd come into the clinic to get blood tests and they'd have a solidified lead alloy that had dripped on their boots and,

79
00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:05,880
and under clothing. And so clearly there was some industrial hygiene, basic industrial hygiene practices that needed some improvement,

80
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:14,010
which we offered and provided through the lead based paint, as you probably well know,

81
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:29,400
was used historically and a major source of sort of so for paint inside as well as outside that crumbles that that becomes dust essentially,

82
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:33,540
and that can be trapped in hand-to-mouth ingestion and so forth.

83
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:44,729
And then of course, lead in gasoline. Actually what I read was that General Motors and its big my current employer of course,

84
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:53,880
and its big shareholder, DuPont decided created a tetra ethyl lead as an anti knock compound.

85
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,470
So instead of puttering along at 35 miles an hour, you have very powerful engines.

86
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:01,830
And thus came the Ethyl Corporation.

87
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:10,230
Fill her up, fill them up with ethyl. And that effectively distributed all led throughout our environment for decades.

88
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,430
And again of relevance to Flint.

89
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:26,320
You can see that lead has been used in piping water pipes, also solder that's used in joints that connect one pipe to the next.

90
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:30,250
Also within the fixtures to the faucets of fixtures.

91
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:43,360
And all these have relevance not only in Flint but in places, any place that has lead use in these kinds of water distribution systems.

92
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:52,630
So in terms of exposure in the general population at this point, major sources, lead residues from paint.

93
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:57,969
And of course, as we've talked about and we'll talk more about contaminated food,

94
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:07,090
contaminated water for large population exposures in terms of occupational settings, it's inhalation,

95
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:14,979
as I've talked about, and as a second major source of the general population,

96
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:20,680
especially because of dust and historically inhalation was the primary environmental source.

97
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:32,410
But we did do a good turn by getting rid of lead in gasoline, and you'll see some of the evidence for the beneficial effects of of doing that.

98
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:37,620
And then we'll talk a little bit more to about endogenous exposure.

99
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:46,570
So what do I mean by that? I mean that that when you get exposed to lead, that gains entry into your body, it finds a repository in your skeleton.

100
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:55,720
So bones and teeth, for example. So the lead that accumulates in one's body pretty much resides in the skeleton, in the bones.

101
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:59,919
And so the question is how much can that be?

102
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:07,510
Essentially resuspended re mobilized so that it can circulate in the blood and cause its toxic effect.

103
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:22,270
So let absorption inhalation is very efficient. About 95% of what we inhale in fume or in dust can gain entry to the systemic circulation.

104
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:28,750
If you drink water or eat food as contaminated, it depends with adults.

105
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:32,170
The amount that we absorb through the gut is relatively low.

106
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:40,480
But for children, for a three year old in Flint, you can see that up to 40 to 50% of the lead in the water can be absorbed.

107
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:46,360
And so and not only that, lead acts in many ways sort of like calcium goes.

108
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:54,580
And if you are calcium deficient, if you have poor nutrition, then it'll be more likely that you will absorb lead than if now.

109
00:13:54,580 --> 00:14:00,250
So you may have read or heard that for children, one of the things that are a safe room,

110
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:06,310
for example, in Flint providing lead free water like in in bottled water,

111
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:17,830
but to provide good enough nutrition, enough calcium, for example, so that the efficiency of absorbing lead from the GI tract will be reduced.

112
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:28,840
Typically you don't absorb much let through the skin, but you'll see that organic fired or organic metal compounds tend to,

113
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:34,090
I guess because of their polarity, tend to be more easily absorbed through the skin.

114
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:48,200
So I've already said that once lad gained entry to the body is distributed and eventually most of it will reside in the bone.

115
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:52,609
You know what half lives are more than half. Life is so biological.

116
00:14:52,610 --> 00:15:00,620
Half life is simply the length of time it takes for half of whatever amount you're talking about to be cut in half.

117
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:08,870
And for a lead in bones, the half life can be years or decades, so quite a long time.

118
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:17,930
Which means it takes quite a long time for the cumulative to the accumulated dose to be dissipated from the body.

119
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:26,210
While we do test the blood for lead blood, lead testing is the most common measure.

120
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:32,210
Only a very small portion of the lead that's absorbed is found in the blood.

121
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:40,460
The conventional wisdom has been that that's the most active compartment in terms of toxicity.

122
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:50,150
But also once the the lead is absorbed, it doesn't reside in the blood for a long time.

123
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:52,610
So so there's a problem with that.

124
00:15:52,610 --> 00:16:01,010
You may have read in the paper that it's good for about 30 days after the exposure has stopped, the blood lead levels start to drop.

125
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:07,009
So here's a kind of a picture that tells us a little bit of what we know,

126
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:12,470
but also some of what we don't know about metabolism, distribution of lead in the body.

127
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:20,990
So the vertical line, so the x axis is time and the vertical dotted lines are the period of time of exposure.

128
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:25,580
And that lat and that top horizontal line is environmental lead exposure.

129
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:29,330
And you can see when exposure starts and then when it ends.

130
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:33,350
And the second line from the top is the blood lead level,

131
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:41,240
which will start rising once we start getting exposed and will stay elevated during the time of exposure.

132
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:48,140
But once exposure stops after some period of time, the blood lead level will actually drop.

133
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:57,979
So it's present and during the time of exposure and so for some time after exposure stops,

134
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:05,120
but then it'll drop and then you can see the line below that, which is cumulative or cumulative blood exposure.

135
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:14,659
So you can see that it rises and then it stays elevated because of the half life is so long you don't expected the cumulative dose that you've got,

136
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:19,969
so you get it and it doesn't go away. Arsenic, very different, doesn't get stored.

137
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:23,090
It gets flushed from the body very fairly quickly.

138
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:32,240
And then the very bottom line is the bone lead, and you can see that it rises paralleling cumulative flood exposure.

139
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:39,260
And then it sits there and that first histogram, that reddish thing, it's says bone lead is a repository.

140
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:45,980
That's one paradigm. So that the lead stays there and it's not very toxic.

141
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:51,710
It's sort of locked up. It's sort of like this pestis, you know, locked up in the floor tiles or or something.

142
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:57,460
And so that's at least one theory or one paradigm. Maybe it just sits there.

143
00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:04,310
It's a repository. The second paradigm is born, led as a source, and that's that red and white thing with the red.

144
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:16,729
And that's demonstrates that over time, depending on your condition, may be disease state that causes bone to be turned over.

145
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:20,690
So we metabolize bone and then we rebuild bone.

146
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:24,320
And the more bone is metabolized, bone that contains lead.

147
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:35,899
It can mobilize the lead. So so lead has a at the bone as a lead source then is a repository that can endogenous lead from

148
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:42,620
within the body cause you to be exposed to higher levels of lead as the bone is turned over.

149
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,520
And I don't know if we have a final answer.

150
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:53,629
I don't know if you have an idea about whether there's a final answer about whether it's a repository or whether it's a source of light.

151
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:57,590
It's likely a combination of both, yeah.

152
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:06,490
So important information about how lead is distributed in the body and how it resides for a long time.

153
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,980
Pretty, pretty important stuff about lead.

154
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:16,270
So here's here's just a picture that shows you when you get rid of lead in gasoline and you can see where that is.

155
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:24,430
These but the black triangles led use and gasoline started to drop in the seventies and then at the

156
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:30,130
same time you can see the average blood lead level and in the population dropping at the same time.

157
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:37,990
So that really had a significant impact in lowering blood lead levels in the US population.

158
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:45,970
So you could call it one of the great environmental health successes or you could say we finally cleaned up our mess after we totally failed.

159
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:53,260
So depending on how you look at it, we did correct a grave situation.

160
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:56,829
And the thing is, the lead is still in the soil. It can be resuspended.

161
00:19:56,830 --> 00:20:06,070
So it's still and there is still a repository of lead in and in soils that can be resuspended and cause ongoing exposure.

162
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:10,530
Just another graph to show you that things have changed.

163
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:20,559
This x axis here is not time, but different age groups and the mean blood blood level on the y axis.

164
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:29,230
And you can see from 76 in 1980, the average blood lead levels was over ten micrograms per deciliter.

165
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:35,680
88 to 91, the numbers were between maybe one and four or so, depending on the age group.

166
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:44,530
And in 2002 ten, the level was even lower than that average of 1.2 as a geometric mean.

167
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:50,980
So the levels in the US population have really continued to drop significantly.

168
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:59,870
In this kind of a busy slide. But one more picture to show you improvement in this case with respect to children and

169
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:11,300
with also respect to policy policies devised as a method of reducing exposure in children.

170
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:19,820
So there were two colored bars on the histogram for each time period.

171
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:25,639
And so you can see one.

172
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:29,150
The light blue is the prevalence.

173
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:32,900
What percentage of samples had a blood lead level? Over ten.

174
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:44,520
And that was before we concern considered the level of concern for children as being five so above the level of over ten.

175
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:49,800
And you can see nearly over 80% in the seventies had levels over ten.

176
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:59,940
And then the dark blue is the geometric mean blood lead level in micrograms per deciliter, which is on the Y axis on the right hand side.

177
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:05,040
Anyway, you can just follow it from the seventies to the eighties to the nineties to the 2000.

178
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:09,149
How both the percentage, the light blue histograms,

179
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:18,840
the percentage of samples with elevated blood lead levels defined as ten or more as well as the geometric mean have dropped considerably.

180
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:27,090
And then you can look at what policies were were created to try to achieve that.

181
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:38,220
So this is a list of symptoms that one might expect from acute or chronic lead toxicity.

182
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,010
You can look at them.

183
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:50,340
The take home message here is that there isn't something like a warning sign, like you spilled the ammonia in your nose and your lungs are burning.

184
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:53,910
There isn't something that jumps out and says, Oh, that's lead.

185
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:58,080
That's that's LED toxicity. So that's really the take home message.

186
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:05,370
There are a number of symptoms that are associated with lead, but none that jumps out in and says lead.

187
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:12,430
Historically, there were certain findings on a physical exam that we would see.

188
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:21,460
These are pretty rare these days, at least in the United States. We don't see people with significant high level toxicities too low.

189
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:25,040
So you can see nerve policies.

190
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:35,440
There is weakness. This thing about RBCs, red blood cells, you could do a smear, look under the microscope and you'd see certain findings,

191
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:42,250
a lead line on the gums, which again, is not the kind of thing you typically see these days.

192
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:49,180
It's probably fairly rare. So what kind of which organ systems those let affect?

193
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:55,000
Well, just about everyone. Certainly the nervous system, both the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system,

194
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:02,980
g.i system, bones, kidneys related to cardiovascular disease, reproductive effects.

195
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:08,930
And, you know, so I'm going to just step back a second.

196
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:15,730
There's a lot of detail here. Sort of the trees of the individual facts about what lead can do.

197
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:22,840
But there's also some broader pictures that sort of the force there that you can gain from that.

198
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:26,110
So one is that LED affects almost every organ system.

199
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:32,380
I don't think it causes asthma. There's not much in terms of respiratory findings.

200
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:42,070
But the fact is that there are both findings that we have seen from high level exposures.

201
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:50,140
But over time we have seen findings that were not clinically evident and which we only learned about more recently.

202
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:57,750
So the central nervous system, some of the nonspecific findings that I've already mentioned,

203
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:07,090
but also cognitive impairment of the saturnine encephalopathy, delirium, coma.

204
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:11,160
Again, this is a thing pretty much of the past.

205
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:23,340
With children. And this is something that's only been defined in the last 30 years or so that

206
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:29,010
there is a number of impairments of the central nervous system personality,

207
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:38,730
cognition, behavior, executive function of behavioral changes, for example, linked with, for example, violent behavior.

208
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:48,420
And some of these findings now are being attributed at levels that used to be considered to be acceptable.

209
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:57,860
And and again, what I already mentioned is that when a kid is three years old, the brain is still developing,

210
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:03,440
synapses are still being formed and so forth, so that there were still a significant period of vulnerability.

211
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:09,230
Both fetal exposure then, as well as up to about five years or so.

212
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:22,300
Here's just a table that shows some of the more recent evidence for the effects of low level lead in children.

213
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:30,280
Where you can see there is sufficient evidence for four levels, less than five micrograms per deciliter,

214
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:38,860
decreased academic achievement, IQ specific cognitive measures, attention related behaviors, problem behaviors.

215
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:50,259
And there is a whole literature that is making association between exposures at this level and children and ten,

216
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:54,340
15 years later, violent behavior or even criminal behavior.

217
00:26:57,810 --> 00:27:02,070
So just to show what we've learned and what we've done about it,

218
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:12,780
you can see over time what the lowest blood led level that was considered elevated by the CDC or the public health service in the seventies.

219
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:16,980
We used to think, well, if it was 40 or below, you were okay.

220
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:25,400
And then you can see over time how it's dropped and dropped and dropped as we've learned more about the effects of a flood.

221
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:29,160
And I just throw this thing I was in Baltimore, this thing about Freddie Gray,

222
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:36,239
he's the the young man who was who died in police custody in the van in Baltimore.

223
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,540
And that death triggered that civil unrest.

224
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:43,260
I happened to be at a meeting in Baltimore during that time.

225
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:46,920
And so it it was kind of driven home.

226
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:57,030
So I just thought I'd throw in the fact that Freddie Gray at 22 months had a blood blood level of 37 micrograms per deciliter.

227
00:27:57,630 --> 00:28:03,180
And it's complicated. I'm not saying that that was why. He was in the position he was in.

228
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:13,710
But it's one of sort of multiple factors that that may come into play in trying to explain something like this.

229
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:18,480
And what I'm getting at is this graph here,

230
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:27,690
and it's from a paper describing the effects of a neurotoxic chemical on a population over time and used lead

231
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:36,000
as well as a number of other chemicals or exposures in large population exposures that follow this pattern.

232
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:41,820
And what is sort of summarizing what I've already said, and that is the first evidence is, boy,

233
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:50,310
sort of like the obscurities, you know, where he could say 2000 years ago, that lead is bad for the brain.

234
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:55,350
With high level exposure, you see significant effects.

235
00:28:55,920 --> 00:29:04,590
But what we're talking about is the lower left hand portion of the curve here where we're seeing the y axis, the number of people affected.

236
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:14,700
And the X axis is over time. So early on, we could see in a few highly exposed adults some significant effects.

237
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:25,880
And then here has over time and as more people have experienced exposure, we start recognizing subclinical effects.

238
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:29,430
So, for example, lead causes, anemia, which I talk about.

239
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:33,899
And the fact is that we didn't discover that at first, but over time.

240
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:37,440
So that's a subclinical effect, even, for example, of it's mild anemia.

241
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:47,040
So we start seeing larger groups affected in more subtle ways to the point where we get to the upper right side,

242
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:56,610
where you might consider that large groups within the population, children in the forties,

243
00:29:56,610 --> 00:30:01,320
50, 60, 70 years with high levels of exposure from lead and gasoline, for example.

244
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:13,200
But we might be actually experiencing a pandemic of the central nervous system effects that we wouldn't have had a clue to.

245
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:21,430
I mean, there's some literature that suggests there is a causal link between the two,

246
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:28,530
the crime wave increase up to the eighties and starting and peaking at the nineties and then dropping.

247
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:35,730
But that is linked to whether that is an example of this silent pandemic, for example, that exposure.

248
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:48,329
And this kind of thing has other this kind of pattern is is an example that that is shown with LED.

249
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:53,190
But also if you want to if you want to find that article and look at it's only a few pages long,

250
00:30:54,300 --> 00:31:04,170
you can see that other central nervous system, toxics toxins can show the same kind of pattern.

251
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:09,320
So the summary there is that the idea is that there's a dose dependent.

252
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:16,730
There's a continuum of toxic effects. Some of them are clinically obvious that someone could see 2000 years ago.

253
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:26,960
And and the but however, they may have subclinical counterparts that maybe in some cases we certainly have not even discovered.

254
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:36,280
So we've already talked about Flint. And the thing is, it's not the first.

255
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:43,220
There's there's a literature about what happened in Washington, D.C., about 14 or 15 years ago.

256
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:48,290
Similar kind of situation. And why won't it be the last I think I read there?

257
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:59,930
There's some millions of miles of lead pipe that is around the country that is distributing water in city and water systems throughout the country.

258
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:10,490
There's also, as we talked about, solder, even if it's not lead pipe, it's lead containing solder or lead containing fixtures.

259
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:17,120
And so we have lined much of our water distribution systems throughout the country with lead

260
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:26,390
containing materials that it's okay if it's not released by a change in the water system.

261
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:31,880
If anti corrosive chemicals aren't added in, as was the case in Flint.

262
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:40,520
So the lead time bomb, if you will, that's been that was sitting there for dozens and dozens of years, decades was released.

263
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:50,840
So this is from actually it was just published in the American Journal of Public Health this month.

264
00:32:51,350 --> 00:33:04,040
And so it's a comparison of blood elevated blood lead level is elevated, meaning five micrograms per deciliter or greater.

265
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:12,470
And it compares before the water was switched to two from Detroit to Flint, water and after.

266
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:18,020
So the blue is before, the red is after. And there are several comparisons.

267
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:30,950
So, for example, outside of Flint, there was no significant change and far left 0.7 to 1.2% of the samples before and after.

268
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:41,210
Not a significant increase. All of Flint, there was a doubling in the prevalence of elevated blood lead samples.

269
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:46,260
In high gear.

270
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:54,960
W l l The third tier is high water led levels, so that part of Flint that had the highest water lead levels,

271
00:33:55,350 --> 00:34:03,030
you can see that the prevalence of elevated blood lead levels went from 4 to 10 over ten.

272
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:14,290
And that was also statistically significant. And then for parts of Flint that had low water lead levels, there was not a significant increase.

273
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:18,140
There was 1.8 to 2.3 in the prevalence question.

274
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:29,320
Were they taken at the same time of year? I think they were taking it the same time of year so that they could control for seasonal seasonality.

275
00:34:29,950 --> 00:34:33,420
But. Another question I'm asking is.

276
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:41,200
Yeah. You look at the article. Yeah.

277
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:45,270
Good. Good. Okay. He had read it before.

278
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:50,729
Good. Okay. Excellent. There's much more in the article.

279
00:34:50,730 --> 00:35:00,540
They did a geospatial analysis. They looked at measures of disadvantage, socioeconomic disadvantage, of course, what you might imagine.

280
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:06,540
They found that the levels were higher in those areas where there was greater poverty.

281
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:14,020
Okay. So back to the to the more dense detail.

282
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:20,870
Again, more seen in the past with higher lead levels.

283
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:30,350
There was impairment of peripheral nerve function so that there would be weakness for the wrist drop like this, or when you walk,

284
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:42,139
your foot would slap the floor because the muscles that elevated your ankle were weaker compared to the force as you were walking.

285
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:53,030
So those kinds of things happened certainly much more in the past than they do currently led to does bad things for the kidneys.

286
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:57,560
When kidneys are injured, they tend to spill protein.

287
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:01,670
The kidneys filter the blood, they get rid of waste materials.

288
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:06,020
You want to reabsorb proteins back into the blood because you don't want to lose it.

289
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:10,370
Damaged kidneys tend to spill blood. They call that proteinuria.

290
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:16,270
And there also may be some scarring of the kidneys. And there is a link between.

291
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:21,360
Between light exposure and high blood pressure.

292
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:29,290
So the G.I. effects and again, we're not talking about absorption, we're just talking about the effects on the GI system.

293
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:36,700
Again, historically, if there were significant exposure, there could be abdominal pain or discomfort or cramps.

294
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:45,210
And reproductive effects. Lead is suspected of causing birth defects of a tradition.

295
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:50,940
It's associated with miscarriages, stillbirths, preterm delivery and so forth.

296
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:58,970
There's a suspected increase in miscarriages among women whose husbands were exposed to lead and then dead.

297
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:03,479
Actually, I'm not sure if that's related to occupational exposure,

298
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:09,720
which means let's say the worker brings the asbestos or the letter home in share with your family,

299
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:24,720
or if it's related to exposure, male reproductive effects and because LED can in fact affect sperm quality, density, motility and so forth.

300
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:31,430
So I also mentioned about leaden and anemia.

301
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:33,470
There were a couple of enzymes.

302
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:43,130
I don't think you need to know the names of these enzymes, but these are two enzymes that produced the heme portion of hemoglobin.

303
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:51,680
So heme is a is a cyclic component of hemoglobin.

304
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:55,820
And so lead will interfere with these two enzymes.

305
00:37:56,090 --> 00:38:03,889
And this is just a cartoon that shows that when you put a block in a pathway like this,

306
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:08,230
then you build up products, but you don't get your end product.

307
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:14,870
So the product that builds up is what's called proto porphyrin and there may be zinc in it.

308
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:20,780
So they call it zinc, proto porphyrin or zap. Sometimes they call it free erythrocyte.

309
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:27,590
And I just mentioned that because when we do blood tests for lead exposure, at least historically,

310
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:37,670
we would often test for the zip or the epi as a measure of whether the lead was causing an interference,

311
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:43,790
this subclinical interference that you could only detect by doing a blood test.

312
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:54,390
So typically in the past, what we've done for for the in terms of blood in terms of blood testing is to blood, blood testing.

313
00:38:54,600 --> 00:39:01,950
And then typically, like I say, it was almost always paired with doing a test of ZIP or FFP,

314
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:11,820
which can be elevated for other reasons and typically isn't elevated unless you get fairly high levels, levels that aren't typically seen these days.

315
00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:20,310
There are different ways of assessing how much lead is in your in your system, in your skeleton.

316
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:27,510
You can give a key later to provoke a flush of lead from the body and measure it that way.

317
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:37,739
Actually doing X-ray fluorescence, a couple of methods for doing that is is a way to determine the lead content in

318
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:43,440
bone and that is a better measure of the cumulative dose or your body burden.

319
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:53,560
So typically if you have exposure to lead, the first thing you want to do is prevent further exposure.

320
00:39:54,820 --> 00:40:05,290
I've already mentioned that the CDC now regards five as being a five or greater risk being elevated typically for very high levels.

321
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:15,130
A collection would be advised, and possibly for lower levels, depending on whether there's symptoms associated with it.

322
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:19,090
And I've already mentioned some of the materials used for collation.

323
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:28,540
Also in some ways is still way back in the seventies, literally in the seventies, the standard for lead was adopted in the seventies.

324
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:33,070
Um, it does have a provision, the medical removal provision.

325
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:40,569
They do have exposure levels and they require surveillance, medical surveillance.

326
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:45,250
If you have exposures over the action level and they have this medical removal provision,

327
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:57,160
which means that if your blood lead level is too high, 50 or 60, depending on how it's measured, you are required to be removed from exposure.

328
00:40:57,430 --> 00:41:04,060
So remove from work. But also you also permit you to come back to work if your level is 40 or lower.

329
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:14,610
Which doesn't make a lot of sense to to continue to have exposure to lead with a level of, let's say, 39.

330
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:18,750
But like I say, the it takes.

331
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:25,169
What do we see on average a dozen years or so for the for OSHA to promulgate a standard?

332
00:41:25,170 --> 00:41:31,710
So this kind of thing is so I think they have yet to reassure the state, to reassure any standard.

333
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:38,490
Yeah. So they may not. Yeah. It's almost virtually impossible for them to do that.

334
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:48,700
There's a lot of people estimated, a lot of children estimated in the country with blood lead levels that are over five,

335
00:41:49,450 --> 00:41:59,500
a level that is have it's been demonstrated to cause cognitive impact of thousands of adults as well with blood levels over 40.

336
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:05,740
And globally, you can as you might imagine, that it's actually much worse.

337
00:42:06,070 --> 00:42:14,950
And similar to VCP, we often export some of our hazardous industries, so for example, auto battery plants and so forth.

338
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:27,780
So I mentioned organic lead compounds can be transmitted through the skin relatively easily, primarily a central nervous system system, system toxin.

339
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:37,690
You can see the kinds of symptoms that that organic lead can cause, and it's not measured well by blood in that case.

340
00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:51,340
Doing a urine test is a better index. So that is really distributed widely in our environment as a result of our behavior in the past, over decades.

341
00:42:52,510 --> 00:43:01,420
There are subclinical and serious effects both in children and in adults, some of which have only been recognized relatively recently.

342
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:06,520
And so cumulative exposure is important to consider.

343
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:12,310
It may be a source of endogenous exposure if it's essentially mobilized from bone.

344
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:18,190
Current exposure, of course, as well. Fetal exposures for for children.

345
00:43:18,190 --> 00:43:24,580
Fetal exposures as well as exposures in early childhood are important.

346
00:43:25,330 --> 00:43:30,730
And so. And so that's good.

347
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:36,130
These are old, I guess, what you would consider critical issues in terms of understanding blood.

348
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:42,340
Lowering the level to five for children is probably better in terms of protecting kids,

349
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:53,050
but the levels we have for adults are certainly in the occupational setting, are not are not very protective.

350
00:43:54,100 --> 00:44:00,520
So before we move on to the next metal, any any questions or any comments about lead,

351
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:05,620
any comments about what you've read about Flint or questions or comments about that?

352
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:16,120
First. Yeah.

353
00:44:16,130 --> 00:44:18,630
Well, maybe there must be anecdotes. A couple of things.

354
00:44:18,650 --> 00:44:32,630
One is that currently in the work area in Nigeria, where people are doing informal sector, small scale gold mining and there.

355
00:44:34,390 --> 00:44:40,780
The next mercury with or and then they turn it off to the steadily torches and fairly, you know,

356
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:46,000
it's all sort of mixed up with where people are living in a family that's, you know, it's people without makeup.

357
00:44:46,630 --> 00:44:50,350
So there's been a lot of because of this area in Nigeria,

358
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:57,700
there's lots of red and gold or there's actually been an epidemic where apparently hundreds of children this is going on.

359
00:44:57,700 --> 00:45:01,240
Currently, hundreds of children have actually died of lead poisoning.

360
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:07,450
Dogs don't usually die from it, but children have much more profound effects on central nervous system.

361
00:45:07,990 --> 00:45:15,610
So that's going on. And well, I agree that, well, this is probably 20 years old now, so maybe it's changed more.

362
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:19,330
I agree that it's unusual to see someone with those classic symptoms.

363
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:29,500
I saw a 20 year old who had was hired in to take apart bridges, outdoor, you know, bridges across.

364
00:45:30,010 --> 00:45:33,010
And, of course, you know, lead paint was used.

365
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:38,960
It is still used in some places outdoors because it's extremely weather resistant.

366
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:44,000
And so most bridges, especially this old paint, there's very high content of lead.

367
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:49,879
And his job was to take it to get ready.

368
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:55,430
I'm sorry. It was is to retain it. He had a sand blaster, so he also had to worry about silica,

369
00:45:55,790 --> 00:46:03,739
that he was removing the surface paint and it was not properly set up to follow the regulations.

370
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:08,180
Essentially, he wasn't given any kind of respiratory protection is supposed to have.

371
00:46:08,330 --> 00:46:13,220
He was you know, he was working close, very close to where he was applying this.

372
00:46:13,730 --> 00:46:21,590
So he came in after three months as a summer job, college age, with a blood load of 120 micrograms per deciliter.

373
00:46:21,930 --> 00:46:24,320
All kinds of vague complaints about various.

374
00:46:25,730 --> 00:46:32,900
So you can still occasionally see quite severe cases of poisoning, occupationally, where things are not under control.

375
00:46:33,770 --> 00:46:43,009
And then my last one is, I have to tell you. So you saw that was in the 1970s when the lab was banned and U.S. gasoline, which is true.

376
00:46:43,010 --> 00:46:49,229
You can say either one. But most people will point out and say that's probably the biggest single public health victory that happened

377
00:46:49,230 --> 00:46:55,400
in the US in terms of a single a single public health action to improve the health of the U.S. population.

378
00:46:56,290 --> 00:47:00,170
So in 1992. So we're now like 15 years later.

379
00:47:00,190 --> 00:47:08,889
I went to South Africa and got a tour from one of the the petroleum industry people, and they took me somewhere and they said,

380
00:47:08,890 --> 00:47:17,110
and this is where we're going to build the new Tetra ethanol led plant to sort of put in their gasoline, which,

381
00:47:17,110 --> 00:47:24,100
by the way, it never had, was two years before the the national government, an apartheid regime, went out.

382
00:47:24,370 --> 00:47:29,169
That plant was actually never built. And they eventually led to the gasoline.

383
00:47:29,170 --> 00:47:36,430
But it's I guess it's just to point out that the fact that something's happening and more developed countries doesn't

384
00:47:36,430 --> 00:47:42,130
mean that the same kind of attention or the same kind of information is being applied in other parts of the world.

385
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:46,690
Even sometimes we are relatively sophisticated in other parts of the world like South Africa.

386
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:56,140
Yeah. Okay, I'll start. I think about four years ago, I got a call from a painter who worked solo in Ann Arbor.

387
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:59,889
And his lead level, I think, was sixties or seventies.

388
00:47:59,890 --> 00:48:07,330
And I called a colleague of Dr. Robbins, Dr. Frangela, who's who's still with the university, but is somewhere else.

389
00:48:07,330 --> 00:48:10,470
And she's backstage. He's back.

390
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:14,010
All right. So but very high levels.

391
00:48:15,130 --> 00:48:22,720
Companies that are bigger tend to be a little bit have more resources and take precautions.

392
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:24,400
For example, if you're doing work.

393
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:34,030
And in my house in Ann Arbor, which was built in 1932, there's probably led when you get down to the lower levels of paint on the walls.

394
00:48:34,990 --> 00:48:39,010
But the companies have done work in my house, have taken precautions for that.

395
00:48:39,010 --> 00:48:43,930
They set up clean and they they use respirators and so forth.

396
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:49,160
This guy. Just did his painting on his own.

397
00:48:49,170 --> 00:48:54,510
He was a solo painter and he didn't take those precautions and maybe he wasn't aware of it.

398
00:48:54,780 --> 00:49:01,110
And he had a very high level level. So that's still, I think, unfortunately, pretty common.

399
00:49:01,150 --> 00:49:08,130
Okay. Yeah. So one last comment that I have. It's a critical comment and I realize you're not clinicians, but it's interesting.

400
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:12,460
So that individual I just described, the one that was working on the bridges,

401
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:18,030
which gave him big doses of chelating agents to try to get as much of my life as they could.

402
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:26,140
Different situation. You come in and somebody has got a blood level of 60 or 70 or even 80 micrograms per deciliter.

403
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:34,570
And the reason they have that is because they've been working in some shop that's been making lead acid batteries and with poor controls.

404
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:38,170
And that person has been doing that for the last 25 years.

405
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:44,010
We don't keep those people. The reason we don't killing them is because they're there.

406
00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:51,340
The total mass of lab rats in their bodies, which is of course, more than 90% stored in the bombs,

407
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:56,680
is so high that you kill a person, it will remove what's in their blood.

408
00:49:56,680 --> 00:50:00,309
That level will go down and dramatically.

409
00:50:00,310 --> 00:50:05,010
And then within a few weeks, Max will be right back where it was before.

410
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:09,820
So you essentially can't accomplish anything because the person has somehow stirred in their body.

411
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:16,170
You can never take all of it out, even if you try to kill any agents do have some adverse effects themselves.

412
00:50:16,170 --> 00:50:18,760
So you don't want to just get rid of everyone in the world.

413
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:24,970
Actually, that that's important to know that they have these adverse effects because there's a lot of.

414
00:50:25,950 --> 00:50:31,120
Practitioners, including physicians to. To have different points of view on this.

415
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:38,130
But a lot of people are willing to articulate an individual who has what's considered

416
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:44,790
but most of Western medicine to be very low levels of potentially toxic metals.

417
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:51,480
And I think in that situation, you can accomplish very little articulated person at times.

418
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:55,470
If you're unlucky, you may actually cause renal disease as an example.

419
00:50:55,740 --> 00:51:02,220
So I don't recommend it if you're planning to go get it now unless you really have a high level.

420
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:10,910
I had to talk a family member out of chelating with trace level trace amounts of these heavy metal screens.

421
00:51:11,090 --> 00:51:15,890
Anyway, arsenic has been used also as a medication.

422
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:24,110
Ladies say arsenic, complexion, wafers. I don't know where that's from, what you're that's from, but of course, it's a poison.

423
00:51:24,290 --> 00:51:39,210
And so. So after the good old days, it's good for for suicide, for homicide and and quite notorious use in that way.

424
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:49,110
And also, as I've mentioned, physicians have used it as medication through the years, also as a pesticide.

425
00:51:50,570 --> 00:51:57,230
Also as a gas in World War One, maybe maybe in the Middle East, not sure.

426
00:51:58,550 --> 00:52:09,260
And actually, that can be combined and have lots of different forms which have lots of different sort of behaviors, absorption, distribution.

427
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:18,470
So it can be complex, often released as a byproduct of smelting, copper and lead is an example.

428
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:23,690
And here's a picture of one application.

429
00:52:26,150 --> 00:52:31,310
The picture is of just your neighborhood playground with that kind of greenish wood.

430
00:52:31,730 --> 00:52:42,190
One of the branches of the Cold War immunized. These are copper chromate, arsenic solutions that would is treated under high temperature and pressure.

431
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:50,630
And there was this actually a warehousing company that used my clinic in Westland, I think just 20 minutes from here.

432
00:52:51,410 --> 00:52:59,300
And I tested their workers who worked in this high pressure treatment area for arsenic.

433
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:04,700
Didn't find any. But I'll tell you a little bit about how I tested them.

434
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:08,420
Various ways of absorption for arsenic.

435
00:53:10,010 --> 00:53:19,280
Similarly to lead, arsenic can affect multiple organ systems the skin, lungs, central peripheral nervous system,

436
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:26,360
the GI system, vulnerable liver, kidneys, just about everything similar to, like I say, to lead and.

437
00:53:27,740 --> 00:53:37,100
It all depends what kind of arsenic. And of course, just like anything, the intensity and duration of exposure, perhaps the rate of exposure.

438
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:48,280
And for a lot of these things, there are effects from acute high level exposure, which sometimes are different from chronic low level exposure.

439
00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:53,649
So for example, high level due to ingestion, for example,

440
00:53:53,650 --> 00:54:03,840
high levels in drinking water as an example can cause the kinds of symptoms that you can see on the GI system can affect the heart.

441
00:54:03,850 --> 00:54:07,420
So that's EKG, electrocardiogram, abnormalities.

442
00:54:09,130 --> 00:54:16,720
There can also, in addition to the acute effects, these toxic effects from acute exposures, that can be a delayed effect.

443
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:25,660
We'll see that later on. With certain pesticides, certain pesticides will cause acute systemic effects and then two weeks later can cause

444
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:33,520
a neurological neuropathy or damage to the nerves the skin can peel with arsenic.

445
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:37,960
There can be colored lines in the nails, effects on the bone marrow.

446
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:43,960
So effects of chronic exposure typically.

447
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:49,780
So for for cancer. Skin cancer, bladder cancer and lung cancer.

448
00:54:51,610 --> 00:54:59,260
And for lung cancer, whether the arsenic is inhaled or ingested, there's evidence that even ingested arsenic can cause lung cancer.

449
00:55:00,310 --> 00:55:08,860
And there can also be effects on the skin and the blood vessels and peripheral nerves unrelated to cancer effects on the bone marrow,

450
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:20,550
liver, kidneys and so forth. So The Chronicle talked about neurologic effects that economically is just a fancy word for nerve damage on the skin.

451
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:28,170
There can be thickening thick plaques on the skin that can be hyper pigmented or dark plaques under the skin.

452
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:33,150
And I've also mentioned skin cancer. Three kinds of cancer.

453
00:55:33,990 --> 00:55:41,670
Skin cancer. Here's a picture of these thick plaques and plaques on the palms.

454
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:47,380
There can be effects on the blood vessels, what's called Raynaud's syndrome.

455
00:55:47,710 --> 00:55:51,130
Or the blood vessels will constrict when exposed to cold.

456
00:55:51,430 --> 00:55:56,410
Or your skin will turn various colors white, red and blue.

457
00:55:58,210 --> 00:56:07,720
And there is also an association with long term exposure in cardiovascular disease death related to cardiovascular disease.

458
00:56:09,150 --> 00:56:17,309
And some studies, a number of studies in arsenic smelter workers with increased rates of lung cancer.

459
00:56:17,310 --> 00:56:21,870
So one occupational group where lung cancer has been associated.

460
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:32,610
So our scene is this one form of arsenic that's a gas with a kind of a peculiar odor to it.

461
00:56:33,850 --> 00:56:39,030
It's often frequently found in in semiconductor processing.

462
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:47,070
And it's got its own very special kind of toxicity where it essentially lysis or destroys blood cells.

463
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:55,350
The red blood cells spill their contents. And as they're going through, the kidneys cause damage to the kidney.

464
00:56:55,350 --> 00:56:58,020
So hemoglobin urea area simply means urine.

465
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:04,800
And so the hemoglobin is being flushed out in the urine and causing kidney damage as it passes through the kidneys.

466
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:10,140
So a little bit of metabolism and excretion.

467
00:57:10,690 --> 00:57:20,250
Inorganic arsenic compounds tend to be organic fiber methylated, and that tends to cause them to be less toxic.

468
00:57:20,790 --> 00:57:27,150
So these organic, higher methylated compounds that are arsenic are less toxic.

469
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:37,110
So if you go to a Red Lobster and have a meal of fish yourself, shellfish, and you measure arsenic in your urine, you'll see.

470
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,450
Potentially high concentrations. It's organic arsenic.

471
00:57:41,450 --> 00:57:49,069
It's not inorganic. So it tends to have low toxicity, but it does have ramifications in terms of testing arsenic.

472
00:57:49,070 --> 00:57:54,290
So like I did with these these workers around the UK.

473
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:55,280
What treatment?

474
00:57:56,590 --> 00:58:08,499
So to distinguish it importantly from, uh, from lead, you see that, that the half life is, is much less than led and there are mobilized able stores.

475
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:11,590
So we don't have repositories of arsenic in the system.

476
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:13,990
We tend to flush it out fairly quickly.

477
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:26,290
We can identify it in hair and nails, that sort of and it sort of incorporates integrates exposure over many months.

478
00:58:27,730 --> 00:58:30,790
Typically, we use urine.

479
00:58:31,450 --> 00:58:35,760
And as I've said, you have to distinguish between organic versus not.

480
00:58:35,770 --> 00:58:48,310
It costs more. Or you can ask people not to eat fish or seafood and blood is not as useful since it's clear pretty quickly.

481
00:58:48,550 --> 00:58:56,080
So for these woodworkers, these workers at Weyerhaeuser, I had them collect your urine over 24 hours.

482
00:58:56,740 --> 00:58:59,860
It's not done. It's done not in commonly in medicine,

483
00:58:59,860 --> 00:59:03,189
where we have people collect your urine for 24 hours and it would be at the

484
00:59:03,190 --> 00:59:07,600
end of a workweek where you'd expect if they had exposure through the week,

485
00:59:07,930 --> 00:59:12,490
the exposure would be more evident at the end of the work week.

486
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:20,710
So in terms of environmental exposure, arsenic is found naturally,

487
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:28,900
naturally natural deposits in the earth, agricultural also industrial practices can cause contamination.

488
00:59:29,650 --> 00:59:34,210
So we do have limits for arsenic in drinking water, as an example.

489
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:46,060
You can go to a website and see a map of whatever area you want to look at and see what concentration of arsenic is in in groundwater.

490
00:59:47,110 --> 00:59:56,650
And in this case, and near the Indian subcontinent, perhaps the largest poisoning of a population in history.

491
00:59:56,830 --> 01:00:03,580
Estimates of up to 70 million people from maybe 20, 30, 40 million, up to 70 million people exposed.

492
01:00:05,970 --> 01:00:12,810
From groundwater contamination and accessing that groundwater via a tube.

493
01:00:13,070 --> 01:00:17,370
So the problem was that there wasn't enough drinking water.

494
01:00:18,180 --> 01:00:23,520
There was high infant mortality, diarrheal illness from drinking surface water.

495
01:00:23,790 --> 01:00:33,450
So UNICEF, the World Bank, led a significant effort to put in what were called two wells, fairly shallow wells by the millions.

496
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:40,020
And there were the result was pretty dramatic in terms of reducing infant mortality.

497
01:00:41,010 --> 01:00:51,419
But what they discovered only somewhat later is that a large percentage of these wells had significant concentrations of arsenic,

498
01:00:51,420 --> 01:00:55,530
well above levels that were considered acceptable.

499
01:00:56,610 --> 01:01:04,170
In the numbers, you can see just hundreds of villages, millions of people with high level exposure,

500
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:12,450
some of the effects from chronic and not so low level arsenic poisoning.

501
01:01:13,290 --> 01:01:16,970
Here's a map of Bangladesh with the darker colors.

502
01:01:18,690 --> 01:01:28,020
So the dark purple, for example, the probability of arsenic exceeding the cutoff of point of five milligrams per liter, 70 to 100%.

503
01:01:28,050 --> 01:01:33,180
So large areas where drinking water was significantly contaminated.

504
01:01:33,780 --> 01:01:37,620
This is West Bengal arsenic poisoning.

505
01:01:38,490 --> 01:01:50,459
Again, large swaths of this area with arsenic patients identified with levels above what's acceptable and just a sort

506
01:01:50,460 --> 01:02:00,480
of a table of percentage of patients with arsenic contaminated water and what kinds of symptoms they had.

507
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:11,639
The pigmentation, apparently, which just means liver enlargement, weakness, the precocious, the plaques on the palms and so on and so forth.

508
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:14,760
Nerve damage, skin cancer and so forth.

509
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:22,020
Just. An incredible episode of Population of Poison.

510
01:02:26,030 --> 01:02:29,200
Any questions or comments? One more.

511
01:02:31,270 --> 01:02:38,630
So Mercury. You can see Lewis Carroll's Mad Hatter.

512
01:02:40,870 --> 01:02:50,530
It is a hammer. Used to be that you'd take animal skins in and carrot the skins, meaning you mix it with mercury nitrate,

513
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:57,310
and then they process the skins by actually chewing the skins to soften them.

514
01:02:57,670 --> 01:03:02,650
And of course, it was a great way of getting large exposures to mercury.

515
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:08,860
So these were people who may have spelt out and hence the term mad as a hatter.

516
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:17,260
And again, if you wondered why HD was is the acronym for Mercury and the Periodic Table of Elements,

517
01:03:17,260 --> 01:03:25,990
you can see and it's simply that the I'm not sure if it's Greek or Latin actually for silver liquid silver.

518
01:03:26,030 --> 01:03:34,720
Water, silver. Just like arsenic doctors used to treat people with mercury.

519
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:40,330
It's been used as a preservative, as a fungicide and paints.

520
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:50,290
When I was a resident here, I got a call from we got actually I guess it was a call from somebody who was using paint from

521
01:03:50,710 --> 01:03:57,580
the Detroit based Mercury Paint Company that was using fennel or purick acetate in its paint.

522
01:03:57,820 --> 01:04:03,370
It's good because if you paint it in your bathroom and it's less likely to grow mold because

523
01:04:03,370 --> 01:04:08,320
you don't turn the fan on when you're taking a shower and you get all that moisture exposure.

524
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:20,780
So maybe, you know, this that mercury, contrary to what you might intuit, has a very high vapor pressure,

525
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:28,190
which is why if you dropped a tube of mercury on your carpeted floor, they would only tear up the carpet.

526
01:04:28,190 --> 01:04:36,680
They take care of the floor. And probably the subfloor because it'll penetrate and that'll be a repository that'll be vaporizing until it's all gone.

527
01:04:37,690 --> 01:04:43,840
So we tapped elemental mercury. And mercury also comes in the form of salts and organic salts.

528
01:04:44,110 --> 01:04:51,340
And then there are organic compounds that very small organic compounds are extremely toxic,

529
01:04:53,560 --> 01:05:00,070
much more so than, for example, that fennel, mercury appropriate or acetate that used to be put into paint.

530
01:05:03,020 --> 01:05:12,979
So with the high pressure. Occupational exposure tends to be by inhalation technicians who use mercury, for example, those who prepare amalgams.

531
01:05:12,980 --> 01:05:18,560
So as contrasted to people who have mercury amalgams in their teeth, in their mouths.

532
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:26,330
There are personnel who work with this stuff. I actually worked with a dental supply house in.

533
01:05:28,060 --> 01:05:37,510
Westlund also in Canton. I think actually that not only had a mercury, which they were very careful with,

534
01:05:37,510 --> 01:05:48,430
but also they used a very fine silica dust to make those molds like of your mouth to like make your teeth.

535
01:05:51,390 --> 01:05:54,780
Paul Stevens thought of that kind of implication.

536
01:05:58,430 --> 01:06:04,940
So in terms of our environmental exposure, it's typically this organic fight mercury.

537
01:06:05,810 --> 01:06:14,720
If it's contaminated in the environment as inorganic, it's organic feed by microorganisms and it's kind of passed up the food chain source.

538
01:06:15,470 --> 01:06:18,470
So up to, for example, the fish people eat the fish.

539
01:06:18,950 --> 01:06:21,840
That's the disaster in Japan, the mini mart,

540
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:32,240
a disaster where large numbers of people in the population were poisoned from eating fish with methylmercury.

541
01:06:34,220 --> 01:06:42,680
So if you have occasion, let's say you smoldering something at home, you're you're trying to purify some metal in your basement.

542
01:06:43,070 --> 01:06:47,510
You can get high levels of exposure that can cause severe pulmonary injury,

543
01:06:48,710 --> 01:06:55,220
that can cause an illness like almost like the flu that they call metal fume fever.

544
01:06:55,820 --> 01:07:03,229
Probably not that common where you're going to get high levels of inhalational exposure to mercury, but that can happen.

545
01:07:03,230 --> 01:07:13,220
Mercury chloride is very corrosive and can be a very strong toxin, very strong irritant to the GI tract.

546
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:18,050
And if you happen to get exposure to the skin, it can also cause allergic disease.

547
01:07:18,770 --> 01:07:22,580
I don't imagine typically that people have skin exposure, but it is possible.

548
01:07:23,850 --> 01:07:31,740
So the chronic effects of inorganic and elemental forms. We're focusing on the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system.

549
01:07:32,040 --> 01:07:38,790
And also if there's inhalational exposure, the oral cavity where you get that word, stomatitis,

550
01:07:38,790 --> 01:07:46,080
just means sores or ulcers can cause damage to the kidneys with high level of exposure.

551
01:07:46,530 --> 01:07:49,890
This classic triad is is described.

552
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:55,920
Again, that probably does not occur that often, at least not in the United States,

553
01:07:56,250 --> 01:08:01,799
because pathologic shyness or central nervous system affect ulcers in the mouth and a tremor.

554
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:07,879
Aggressiveness. Resting tremor. Other neurologic effects and inattention.

555
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:14,450
Tremor just means that as you start to reach your point, then you start to get the tremor that may not be present.

556
01:08:14,990 --> 01:08:20,479
Otherwise, when you're not reaching this kind of central nervous system effects, nervousness,

557
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:27,260
irritability and so forth, or behavioral impairment can cause peripheral nerve damage as well.

558
01:08:28,670 --> 01:08:34,850
These changes may or may not be reversible. I've mentioned already for Stomatitis the ulcers.

559
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:44,330
Gingivitis simply means inflammation or sores on the gums. So these these caustic or corrosive irritant effects in the mouth.

560
01:08:46,710 --> 01:08:51,900
So once it gets in the body, mercury tends to be concentrated in the kidneys.

561
01:08:52,260 --> 01:08:59,230
So as you've already heard, damage to the kidneys will show up as proteinuria.

562
01:08:59,250 --> 01:09:05,490
So you do your analysis and you find elevated amounts of protein in the urine.

563
01:09:08,530 --> 01:09:15,910
So the organic compounds, these very short chain alkyl compounds have a very different toxic profile.

564
01:09:16,270 --> 01:09:19,570
You don't have that burning and or the irritation in the mouth.

565
01:09:20,530 --> 01:09:25,930
These substances are neurotoxins that can have lots of different manifestations.

566
01:09:28,690 --> 01:09:32,770
Very young children in the skin and fetal stages.

567
01:09:33,010 --> 01:09:37,330
There could be very serious effects at this stage of development.

568
01:09:38,260 --> 01:09:43,690
You can get this weakness, difficulty with concentration, emotional instability.

569
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:50,709
There can be tingling and numbness, and there can also be what are called cerebellar impairments.

570
01:09:50,710 --> 01:09:55,900
So cerebellar function, it helps you maintain body sense position and so forth.

571
01:09:55,900 --> 01:10:06,219
And without that you can get loss of balance, ataxia, difficulty swallowing, even walking and and so forth.

572
01:10:06,220 --> 01:10:14,650
And that little round circle is my reminder to tell you about that poster child of, in this case, guy Methylmercury.

573
01:10:15,010 --> 01:10:21,790
And this is The New York Times from 1997. This woman, 47 year old Ph.D. at Dartmouth,

574
01:10:22,810 --> 01:10:34,970
was using guy methylmercury and a little drop of this stuff with his kind of his biscuits as Carol served, dropped on her gloved hand on her thumb.

575
01:10:34,990 --> 01:10:38,590
She immediately removed her glove because she knew this stuff was dangerous.

576
01:10:39,310 --> 01:10:42,340
And I think within eight months she was dead with her blood.

577
01:10:42,340 --> 01:10:47,080
That level 80 times the lethal low dose of mercury from that very,

578
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:57,190
very short duration exposure with organic mercury permeated, nodding along not only her glove, but also her or her skin.

579
01:10:57,730 --> 01:11:06,160
So not very common, but just a sort of a an example of what can happen with these kinds of materials.

580
01:11:06,670 --> 01:11:17,170
And you can imagine that there are biosafety policies both there and other universities where they use materials like that.

581
01:11:17,380 --> 01:11:22,900
They had to think about what they had in place and what they needed to have in

582
01:11:22,900 --> 01:11:27,730
place in terms of protecting future investigators from this kind of exposure.

583
01:11:29,300 --> 01:11:39,020
So for mercury, for biological monitoring, typically for non-organic mercury, we're using urine.

584
01:11:40,280 --> 01:11:49,310
And again, we did get a 24 hour urine. And the case of this scientist with organic mercury exposure.

585
01:11:50,210 --> 01:11:51,230
It's a blood test.

586
01:11:54,260 --> 01:12:03,500
So just like about for most of these materials, you want to remove people from exposure as you don't keep late for chronic toxicity.

587
01:12:05,870 --> 01:12:09,710
I don't have any clinical experience with this. I don't know if you do with Mercury.

588
01:12:10,940 --> 01:12:13,400
It's not the kind of thing you typically see very often.

589
01:12:13,700 --> 01:12:24,290
There is some concern that if you use mercury, you can mobilize mercury from from whatever body storage there may be and cause increased toxicity,

590
01:12:24,290 --> 01:12:26,919
sort of what Dr. Hopkins was just talking about.

591
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:33,050
In some cases, you may not do good by using a key later, you might actually cause more harm than good.

592
01:12:34,940 --> 01:12:39,710
Okay. I'm just going to check the time because we have about six more minutes.

593
01:12:41,540 --> 01:12:45,260
And so there's time certainly to go through cadmium and maybe even beryllium.

594
01:12:45,680 --> 01:12:54,889
So cadmium exposure by way, typically by way of smelting, other cause or metals, it's commonly used for corrosion resistance.

595
01:12:54,890 --> 01:13:02,540
So it's an alloy, meaning a mixture of other metals to provide corrosion resistance.

596
01:13:02,870 --> 01:13:09,410
Other uses that you can see, including your rechargeable, you know, sort of the night cat batteries as an example.

597
01:13:11,890 --> 01:13:13,130
For occupational exposures.

598
01:13:13,150 --> 01:13:21,010
Typically, inflation is the most effective route and the most typical route don't tend to get much through the skin or through the GI tract.

599
01:13:22,390 --> 01:13:29,440
But there is some evidence, as with lead, that with calcium deficiency there may be increased absorption.

600
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:33,870
So people who are working with metals like, well,

601
01:13:33,870 --> 01:13:42,480
welding or soldering or cutting and so forth that can generate fumes or does make it exposed to cadmium by that route.

602
01:13:43,710 --> 01:13:47,490
You get enough of an exposure, you can get this metal fume fever.

603
01:13:48,420 --> 01:13:50,909
It's almost like the flu. So some delay.

604
01:13:50,910 --> 01:13:58,980
Some hours later, you get the chills and you start aching all over and it goes away in a day or two all by itself.

605
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:02,940
Significant exposures can cause inflammation of the lungs.

606
01:14:03,180 --> 01:14:11,309
That's what pneumonitis refers to. And again, the symptoms simply clear up on their own, like lead, like mercury.

607
01:14:11,310 --> 01:14:17,100
Cadmium doesn't have any useful purpose in the body. It can target the kidneys.

608
01:14:17,100 --> 01:14:21,990
And as you can probably guess by now, you hurt the kidneys and the kidneys starts.

609
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:33,450
Kidneys start to spill. Urine and kidney can also have effect on these other systems the bones, the skeleton, lungs, liver.

610
01:14:33,780 --> 01:14:38,009
You can get loss of sense of smell and so forth.

611
01:14:38,010 --> 01:14:41,250
And also linked with lung cancer and prostate cancer.

612
01:14:42,930 --> 01:14:48,600
So cadmium is well, was the source of what's called E.T., E.T. disease.

613
01:14:49,410 --> 01:14:55,500
We talked about minimally disease. So this is one of Japan's call for big pollution diseases.

614
01:14:56,160 --> 01:15:02,970
There was massive cadmium discharge into local rivers for mining operations.

615
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:09,450
The river water was used both for drinking and washing and irrigation for rice.

616
01:15:09,450 --> 01:15:15,719
And people eat the rice as well. And a lot of people suffered from the skeletal side effects.

617
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:24,720
So this is an oft seen photo of somebody with E.T. type disease and what happened to the skeleton.

618
01:15:27,700 --> 01:15:33,769
So for cadmium in terms of biological monitoring. It's a combination.

619
01:15:33,770 --> 01:15:37,850
So blood, cadmium is one way to get a handle on it.

620
01:15:38,570 --> 01:15:43,000
24 hour urine, as we did with arsenic and mercury.

621
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:50,750
And also, we're now looking for some of some specific proteins in the urine that tend to be found with cadmium.

622
01:15:51,470 --> 01:15:55,370
These these are low molecular weight proteins.

623
01:15:55,370 --> 01:15:59,480
So there are certain proteins that are found typically with cadmium, poison poisoning.

624
01:16:00,900 --> 01:16:08,520
Okay. So beryllium really, um, also used as an alloy weapons application SAS,

625
01:16:08,850 --> 01:16:15,240
special alloys and aerospace applications, certain ceramics and semiconductors.

626
01:16:15,450 --> 01:16:24,720
Until about the late forties, beryllium was used in fluorescent lights as well with exposures potentially in all of these settings.

627
01:16:25,740 --> 01:16:32,670
So inhalation is the primary means of getting it into your system and causing beryllium related disease.

628
01:16:33,390 --> 01:16:40,050
There's not much absorption through the skin or through the gut, but there is evidence that if you get enough,

629
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:43,679
I guess beryllium dust on your skin, it can sensitize the skin.

630
01:16:43,680 --> 01:16:48,030
You can actually get an allergic rash from beryllium.

631
01:16:50,340 --> 01:16:57,299
If you get a high enough exposure, typically you're not going to see that these days where people are smart enough companies,

632
01:16:57,300 --> 01:17:02,020
occupational settings were really misused. They tend to be aware of the hazards.

633
01:17:02,020 --> 01:17:03,839
So you don't see that tend to see it.

634
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:11,700
But just like with cadmium as an example, you get a high enough exposure, you can get this inflammation in the in the lungs.

635
01:17:14,100 --> 01:17:18,990
Like I say, the companies that use beryllium, pretty much they're aware of it,

636
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:24,840
the rear of the hazards, not always, but they tend to take proper precautions.

637
01:17:25,380 --> 01:17:29,880
So the take home story about beryllium, who's heard of the disease?

638
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:34,230
Sarcoidosis, anybody? All right, some of you.

639
01:17:34,260 --> 01:17:39,650
So sarcoidosis is this disease that primarily affects the lungs.

640
01:17:39,660 --> 01:17:44,820
It can affect other parts of the body where you get these the middle bullet, these granulomas,

641
01:17:45,150 --> 01:17:57,840
these these sort of rounded collections of inflammatory immune cells that are as a reaction to some stimulus.

642
01:17:58,230 --> 01:18:04,940
So. Sarcoidosis is a granulomas disease and beryllium can look for all the world.

643
01:18:04,940 --> 01:18:09,960
Beryllium related disease berlioz's can look for all the worlds like sarcoidosis,

644
01:18:09,980 --> 01:18:14,540
where you get these grammar low grade calamitous collections in the lungs.

645
01:18:14,930 --> 01:18:20,329
It can take a long time of exposure before you actually develop the disease.

646
01:18:20,330 --> 01:18:24,920
So the sensitization process can take quite a quite a few years.

647
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:32,390
And the way to distinguish it is that you have to understand or become aware that someone had beryllium exposure.

648
01:18:32,450 --> 01:18:37,159
So there's an exposure history and then there's a specific way of diagnosing it.

649
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:47,300
So Dr. Robbins talked about hypersensitivity pneumonitis is one type like asthma of an immune mediated lung disease.

650
01:18:47,630 --> 01:18:56,330
And you remember that asthma is a disease of the airways, whereas hypersensitivity pneumonitis is where the air sacs are,

651
01:18:56,330 --> 01:19:01,489
the crank, where the gas exchanges, and that is cell mediated.

652
01:19:01,490 --> 01:19:14,149
So beryllium related lung disease is also cell mediated, like hypersensitivity pneumonitis is mediated and it takes a sensitization period.

653
01:19:14,150 --> 01:19:19,780
So again, the basis for a latency. So how do you do the test?

654
01:19:20,440 --> 01:19:25,840
You have to collect white cells, in this case, lymphocytes, one kind of white cell.

655
01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:33,900
And you measure how the light cell, these white cells, respond to a provocative exposure,

656
01:19:33,910 --> 01:19:40,630
something some beryllium exposure that if they're sensitized to, you'd expect to see them react to that.

657
01:19:40,990 --> 01:19:50,170
And so it's a lymphocyte proliferation test and it's a measure of the sensitization of the white cells to beryllium.

658
01:19:51,070 --> 01:19:58,120
So you get either white cells, either from the peripheral blood, or you stick a tube down in through the trachea into the lungs.

659
01:19:58,120 --> 01:20:02,140
And you do bronchoscopy and you instill some water. You click on water.

660
01:20:02,380 --> 01:20:08,620
And that lavage or that washing fluid is obtained and the white cells are collected.

661
01:20:09,070 --> 01:20:14,890
And you send it to I don't know how many labs in the country do this, maybe three labs or something like that.

662
01:20:14,980 --> 01:20:18,670
Yeah, maybe three labs in the country. It's a highly specialized test.

663
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:27,070
You have to use radio labeled material and you have to expose the white cells and measure their uptake and radioactivity

664
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:35,740
production and special conditions for special metrics for determining whether the test is positive or not.

665
01:20:36,100 --> 01:20:43,480
So there are some chronic changes and early on is is associated with cancer of the lung.

666
01:20:43,750 --> 01:20:49,240
The beryllium related berlioz's is the big deal with with beryllium and.

667
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:53,840
I'll stop there if you have any questions. Feel free to come on down.
