1
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:14,990
So it's giving everything and it broke the silence.

2
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:18,470
Oh, well, yeah.

3
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:28,160
I think for me, one person was glad Jonathan's okay, so to speak, and I met people.

4
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,850
Oh, yeah, it was fun.

5
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:38,540
Oh, that's good to hear.

6
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:45,330
On the finances. So you want your PowerPoint up and then all the videos?

7
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:58,830
Yes, of course. Which progress?

8
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:31,680
Yes. You gave used it. Do you feel you have got to try to.

9
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:46,690
China is the world's healthiest. Well, I'm biased if I don't support the fact that it's.

10
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:59,290
I'm used to having all of the things that are during the pandemic.

11
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:03,160
So doing a science today is not that great without that.

12
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,930
Yeah, but apologies in advance. I'm horrible, so it's probably going to be the end semester by the time I learn everything.

13
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:16,720
And. Just wait a couple more minutes.

14
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:33,550
Do you all know? Is anybody missing or does this look like. To pressure governments to become more free.

15
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:37,420
Okay. With a few minutes then.

16
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:59,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

17
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:19,190
I remember that. Great.

18
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:23,370
So thanks for coming in person. It's good to see everybody in person.

19
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:32,330
Finally, we're going to start off today actually by talking about the assignment, which will be due there in next week.

20
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:39,290
So just like last time, Johnson has completed that assignment, which I will just pull up over here.

21
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:44,210
Actually, Jonathan, that's probably easiest. Can you pull it up on Zoom and then.

22
00:03:44,270 --> 00:04:11,190
Sure. Like that. Thanks. Everybody.

23
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:19,620
Fantastic. So assignment number two will be taking the same context you chose for Simon,

24
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:24,720
number one, and that about the economic, historical and political context.

25
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:30,120
It's the same when you start off talking or just saying what your context is.

26
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:35,400
So John, who is still continuing with HIV in Tanzania, aged 15 to 49.

27
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:39,810
Just one comment on your last assignment. Most of you did this, some didn't.

28
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:46,320
But if you could specify what disease you're looking at or like some kind of things that have a more narrow health focus, that'd be great.

29
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:51,959
Nobody penalized this time. But just going forward. You can specify the health focus.

30
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:57,620
That would be fantastic. And then just like last time, you have a table to fill out.

31
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:04,069
And this is mostly economic indicators. So these top one, two, three, four,

32
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:13,610
five will be the three populated and then three of them over here will be ones that you select by yourself, just like lost.

33
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:19,389
GDP just going through this in case people don't know what they are. GDP is gross domestic product.

34
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:25,240
So how much product is a economy producing and total per capita?

35
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:33,450
Is that divided by the population? HDI Human Development Index is how developed is a population.

36
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:40,420
Those are things like life expectancy, gender rights, education, income, those kind of things.

37
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,249
Total national health spending per year. I'm going to change that two per year, per person.

38
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:53,030
So how much are they spending per person? Per year to make a two per person per capita?

39
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:59,900
The Gini coefficient really interesting that looks at the inequality in the country.

40
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:08,660
So how big is the gap between the highest and lowest? In a country like the US or other EU countries like South Africa that have a really high

41
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:13,250
Gini coefficient because there's so much inequality in the country with less inequality,

42
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:20,000
you have a pretty low Gini coefficient and then Jonathan selected a few other forces over here.

43
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,680
Economic indicator. Jonathan, can you just draw while you select those ones?

44
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:33,720
Sure. Yeah. I would try to identify things that were kind of both health related and more economic or political indicators.

45
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:38,570
So one I was looking at first of health care.

46
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:42,800
So specifically in my context, 10% coming from energy.

47
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:50,150
I was looking at like the stability of the national health infrastructure and how much of that health care spending is

48
00:06:50,150 --> 00:07:00,320
coming from international sources and looking at mental health in particular and also looking at household for electricity.

49
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,580
So that's another economic sector development.

50
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:07,060
Yeah, those all look great.

51
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:13,540
And then, you know, there are obviously quite a few you can choose, but as long as you can justify it like this, that's completely fine.

52
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:25,479
And then kind of going down a bit. Same thing like last time you described the implications of all the indicators you found and you

53
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:30,400
would talk about what you didn't find and why that might be the case and what bias that may be.

54
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:38,200
Next, you're going to talk about the major components of the economy and the burden of poverty.

55
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:42,460
In your context, Jonathan, can you talk us through what you did here?

56
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:53,499
Sure. So I think the website is quite helpful for giving you some kind of general information about background on the country,

57
00:07:53,500 --> 00:08:01,870
but then also feel these other few years probably will have more citations like mine that I think that is mostly as an example for you all.

58
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,080
So I expect some more citations in there.

59
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:18,549
Then I thought I should write off, for example, but looking at the major sectors of the economy and kind of seeing where the wealth is stratified.

60
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:28,330
So like for example, in my context, agricultural accounts for a third or 3.65% of the workforce to looking at where the

61
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:33,790
workforce is stratified and that kind of thing and how that relates to of poverty.

62
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:40,780
Awesome. Thank you. And then Mexico and talk about the political situation and the context.

63
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:45,520
So who is in power? Is that conflict or the power struggles?

64
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:50,589
So going back to who is in power, what party are they from, what kind of political wing are they from?

65
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:57,640
What's their manifesto look like? Conflicts that can be international conflict or or domestic conflict.

66
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:02,259
The election cycle is that election cycle when the next election what's the last

67
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:07,569
election that's actually could you tell us a bit about elections in Kenya?

68
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:14,080
And I know you're on the spot, but this is an example about the instability around elections in Kenya.

69
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:21,440
What exactly? It works just like what it looks like when elections happen and how it impacts the health system.

70
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:24,110
Currently,

71
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:34,670
the current president I was just elected this one week ago is already complaining that the reason why some things in terms of finances is not that.

72
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:43,100
So he doesn't know where to start from. And so very clear what is going on in the country.

73
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:49,069
He gets yeah. For talking about those kind of uncertainties and that kind of thing when there's an election

74
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:54,990
cycle and then what the political system is in a democracy is the monarchy is a dictatorship

75
00:09:54,990 --> 00:10:02,389
because it's some kind of mix of all of those which Johnson did quite well over here and then lost

76
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:12,830
to is the history of the context that Jonathan start of talking about colonialism by Portugal,

77
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:20,260
the trade networks, colonization by the Germans and the British and taking over Zanzibar.

78
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:29,900
And then, you know, a few more things that kind of led Tanzania to what has now been kind of topping off of that by saying,

79
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:34,040
you know, in the component on HIV and how those relate to HIV.

80
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:44,000
Then finally, you talk about constraints on your contracts, ability to provide health services to its population.

81
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:56,509
So we Jonathan, is talking about, you know, the relatively low population density, the high population of youth, the high fertility rates,

82
00:10:56,510 --> 00:11:07,420
which, you know, there have been efforts to reduce and also issues when it comes to child and neonatal, which is fantastic.

83
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:10,700
So just like last time. Thanks, John.

84
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:15,890
And we will upload this online and it's due Thursday of next week.

85
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:26,010
Okay. And then I just want to show you some data sources you can all use as well, which you haven't mentioned before.

86
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:37,290
So one is called DHS program. DHS program is run every year, about five or six years and most low and middle income countries.

87
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:46,050
It's run by USAID, and they collect pretty much anything you can imagine on demographics and health.

88
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:50,839
It's great because, you know, it's a population, it's a population.

89
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:56,510
Groups in the survey and there's so much in there. But the issue is because they collect so much data, it's actually very self-assessment, very broad.

90
00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:00,830
This is still something you should be looking at in case you can't find data elsewhere.

91
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:06,710
Another one is called mix. Which is from UNICEF.

92
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:17,390
It's a multiple indicator cluster survey, and similar to DHS, it collects data from a lot of elamite cities every year, about five or six years.

93
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:22,460
But this is exclusively on maternal newborn child health.

94
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,180
So if you have any if you're working on that, this is another excellent resource.

95
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:30,740
And another good one is.

96
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:43,520
The World Bank Micro Data page. This is now getting pretty down to the weeds, but if you want some really specific data, you can find it here.

97
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:46,620
So let's say, for example, I'm interested in vaccination.

98
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:56,420
And Afghanistan. You know, you can go through these and see if any of these have COVID vaccination looks like it isn't here.

99
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:02,059
But, you know, just kind of click through to see if anything comes up that would help you out of search.

100
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:10,280
Going to this one, for example, includes quite a few indicators on COVID vaccination and prevalence of COVID symptoms.

101
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:17,710
Okay. So that's all for Simon number two. Any questions on that at all?

102
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:25,030
So that example when we uploaded again, like the second one.

103
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:28,750
Yes. Okay. Any other questions?

104
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:33,010
Fantastic. And then next.

105
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:45,990
I will welcome Nancy to introduce herself. Nancy will be speaking today and kind of leading a discussion and very excited for that.

106
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:51,650
The triggers, I don't know. Yes.

107
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:07,800
I probably want to do a little introduction in the class as well.

108
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:15,540
My name is Nancy. I'm from Kenya. I have I have an undergrad in television production.

109
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:20,700
And then my master's is in women's and gender studies. I'm doing it from South Africa.

110
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,230
I'm here for a program called Africa Presidential Scholars Program,

111
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:31,410
which basically sponsors researchers from Africa to come and work on their projects.

112
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:41,810
So I'm working on a research that explores how lesbian subjectivities aren't presented in films, and the film looking at is Rafiki.

113
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:45,000
I hope all of you have interacted in Africa.

114
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:49,500
So a bit of introduction from the team before I proceed.

115
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:54,750
Yep. I would do this myself before I answer that, Jonathan.

116
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:59,640
But maybe if we go around class and everybody can introduce themselves.

117
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:03,980
And if you're interested as well, I would like to love it. Sure.

118
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:09,180
Absolutely. On the Internet, I have Jonathan and I use pronouns.

119
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:19,310
I mean, health management policy program. And I specifically focus my research on health policy more with a domestic focus.

120
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:28,459
But I'm very excited to be here with you all. I have none of my friends as she prefers a global hub AP student and my interest

121
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:35,750
accrued just like communicable diseases and yeah pretty general right now for me.

122
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:42,740
And I'm also Global Health a student and I'm kind of interested in infectious diseases.

123
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:47,850
Jacob Also Global Health and also interested in IP.

124
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:59,120
I'm Rachel. I'm also local health. EPI I'm, I'm interested in looking at how climate change affects vector borne diseases, I mean global health.

125
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:05,840
And I'm interested in looking at race between infectious diseases.

126
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:12,560
I'm Wendy, my producer. She her hers. I'm from microbiology and immunology.

127
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:17,930
So interested in infectious diseases. In this context, I think I want to do women's health.

128
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:23,830
I'm Sophia. I'm a global health student.

129
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:29,499
My general interest is in how climate change is going to change the disease,

130
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:34,600
biogeography and infectious diseases, particularly waterborne diseases and also vector borne diseases to.

131
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:41,570
My name is review. I'm also happy I'm kind of in between.

132
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:50,010
A lot of my interests are. But recently I've been into Kendrick Lamar, who's I'm also a global Africa.

133
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:57,560
I am interested in LGBT and remix health care services for especially folks in Brazil.

134
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:08,410
Front and center is the next round and specifically.

135
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:20,560
Sara I have behavioral health, education. I'm also concerned with health outcomes for people who are more expensive.

136
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:30,710
Chris first year overall interested in and interested in that communicable discourse.

137
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:37,080
I'm also looking healthy and also interested in infectious diseases.

138
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:42,379
I'm not interested in religion.

139
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:52,070
Other. Every small single house effort and some interest and looking qualifications of both of these.

140
00:17:52,110 --> 00:18:03,600
And so I'm very I'm also on the global health stimulus program and my interests include infectious diseases.

141
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:09,110
Awesome. So I just go straight to my PowerPoint presentation.

142
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:19,380
I do. I think I can see the mouse if you go over.

143
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:31,110
Probably. The.

144
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:40,250
All right. So global LGBT health and gaps in medical care.

145
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:48,320
First of all, efforts on getting us to know how we get to different identities.

146
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:52,400
So there's what we call sex and there's what we call gender.

147
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:56,900
I don't know if you know the difference between gender and sex.

148
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:01,970
Anyone. Gender, sex. What is gender and what is sex?

149
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:08,450
Anyone. Thank you.

150
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:15,620
Well, sex is what you're kind of assigned at birth, gender or a social construct of bit more of a spectrum.

151
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:22,350
Any other person. But basically what she says is very true.

152
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:30,930
Sex is what is assigned at birth, and then gender is how you think about yourself, how you choose to express yourself.

153
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:38,880
And this is what we call sexual orientation. Sexual orientation is how you are attracted to someone.

154
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:43,470
You can be attracted to someone physically, you know, according to what they believe in.

155
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:48,690
Depending on what you subscribe to. So that is what we call sexual orientation.

156
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:57,780
And I did mention that gender is mainly constructed by, you know, our societies.

157
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:04,500
So our societies really play a greater role into what gender we identify with.

158
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:11,250
That is just an emphasis of what gender is and sex is.

159
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:14,130
And then there's this Rebecca Cooper,

160
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:24,240
who argues that the gender system is a system of social values and relationships that is externally imposed by people with an aim of exploiting them,

161
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,150
especially the much maligned who agrees? Who doesn't agree in the way?

162
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:42,700
The general system. Are we on the same page?

163
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,770
Yes. What do you think about the agenda system?

164
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,360
The agenda system is the one that assigns roles to people.

165
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:58,040
They say that a woman is supposed to be at home.

166
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:01,580
It's supposed to work. They're supposed to do this.

167
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:04,970
And the man is supposed to do this. So what do you think about the genesis?

168
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:15,270
Yes. I don't know if it was intentionally designed in order to exploit or like put down large numbers of people.

169
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:15,839
But definitely,

170
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:23,520
as people have become more aware and more knowledgeable about like the roles that the gender system has played in like current society,

171
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:33,630
things that people continue to reinforce and I think would lead to like exploiting marginalized groups or any other person.

172
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:39,670
It's in the system. I feel like the in system exploited marginalized groups or minorities because

173
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:45,550
of the status of Western culture with special interests or Europe and the U.S.

174
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:54,819
Whereas, you know, typical woman and gender systems, we have some limits on what I can do and they have been that way tremendously emasculated.

175
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:59,190
Wanted to really desist from something that's very marginalized by all.

176
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:04,250
Okay. Mm hmm. Any other? Yes, I really agree with that.

177
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:13,030
And especially womanhood is tied to long hair and all of these views of what a woman should look like.

178
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,870
Westernized culture. That's not the case.

179
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:25,929
But this images, which are everywhere and very good, also basically like the erasure of like non-binary people, of other genders.

180
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:31,060
It's just like this binary of woman or man. That's it. That's very oppressive to a lot of other people.

181
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:35,650
Mm hmm. That's very good. Thank you for your contributions.

182
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:41,500
Health disparities. And here is why I talk about intersectional factors.

183
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,240
This is a basic structure when it comes to access to health care.

184
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:50,540
There's a point where you develop a health care needs.

185
00:22:51,050 --> 00:23:01,100
For example, for the first three days, I've been having a great time to take care of their needs and then they pass.

186
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:08,090
I mean, I've been taking painkillers every other time. I think every 2 hours I take a painkiller.

187
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:12,409
So I thought I should probably seek attention. That is the desire.

188
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:16,069
I developed a desire and then I started making calls.

189
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:23,870
How can I? I mean, I just came there that day. I didn't know how to go about the healthcare system in this country.

190
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:28,940
So that is me seeking health care. And then it was me reaching out.

191
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:38,000
I went I went to the school of Dentistry and then there's me getting my health, get back to self utilization.

192
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:44,210
You can either be primary or secondary dependent and then there's the consequences to the understanding.

193
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:50,990
So that clinic feeling the thing with the zero, I mean, yeah, I was not helped.

194
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:59,500
So there are so many factors that play a role and that's that is what I'm you to sexual plexus is something like health literacy.

195
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:03,380
I honestly don't know what is the problem with my recruit or.

196
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:14,230
You just keep going over so many points out of reach that we believe in some of our countries.

197
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:22,990
People don't go to hospitals that talk to their religious beliefs that, you know, confine the women from going to churches.

198
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:28,660
So what you do is if you feel sick, you go to your priest, they lay their hands with you.

199
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:33,730
You get that? That is when we believe that trust and expectations,

200
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:41,260
all of these social one use the gender identity a clear greater role of you getting access to health care,

201
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:46,780
giving environment, income, all these things, all of these things play a role.

202
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:50,469
That is what I call intersectional parties.

203
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:55,420
So I wanted us to watch the 12 minutes, but we can do 6 minutes.

204
00:24:55,900 --> 00:25:02,320
Yes. So to just get a glimpse of what it means to navigate these spaces.

205
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:07,940
Yeah. When it comes to access to health care. The rest of the group.

206
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:14,390
I don't know how it should be. If you just want to go into chrome on the bottom and on the.

207
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:21,550
Right. I honestly don't know how to. They minimize that.

208
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:36,310
And for the. So it has six or 6 minutes.

209
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:48,350
You know, to be served in a hospital in the long haul to help a hundred patients have,

210
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:53,180
it has to be appropriate because medication and instruments are in short supply.

211
00:25:56,130 --> 00:26:03,030
One of the world's poorest countries, in particular from the south of the capital, which has a relatively well-equipped hospital.

212
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,050
Doctor to receive aid from generous people.

213
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:11,750
They still can't always give their patients the care they need.

214
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:39,890
So if we don't track where it is pregnant and Dr. Gupta and his assistant are concerned, she has a tumor on one leg and need surgery.

215
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:47,160
Even more complicated movies along the way.

216
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:57,280
Now there is the presence of. So what they.

217
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:10,810
We need to know what it is that we did, the oxygen mask did.

218
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:15,640
This is fortunate they were able to pay for.

219
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:22,180
So it's not like this at all.

220
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:27,020
So let's be honest.

221
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:30,400
It's possible that this is transmitted.

222
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:39,800
Communicating about these two patients is an ultra frequent part of Dr. Vincent's routine.

223
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:51,650
It makes the rounds of the boards twice a week. He and his assistant did a special attention to the more difficult cases.

224
00:27:54,900 --> 00:28:02,550
Every patient they're able to release is another success, such as this woman who came in with ulcerated abdominal muscles.

225
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:12,920
But. Another patient has just been admitted with a suspected rectal tumor.

226
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:20,530
What kind of problems you have? I have blood on my stool that stops.

227
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:25,709
It started when I had the baby with the history.

228
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:33,900
Is she gave birth in March. We will very check that that will have its press passes, too.

229
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:41,850
Okay. I think we can stop the. But, um, what do you think about this video?

230
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:47,670
I mean, this is one doctor slaughtering thousands of patients.

231
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:52,230
So what do you think it comes to such a situation?

232
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:59,120
Okay. This was. Okay.

233
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:02,270
I think both in terms of Western perception,

234
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:08,450
there's this there's this perception that there's not enough acknowledge the doctors kind of professionals don't have enough knowledge.

235
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:13,309
But reality what it really is just like a resource shortage like they don't have the

236
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:18,100
personnel or the equipment to do the procedures or provide the health care that they need.

237
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:26,050
And also think about, you know, most of these African countries then.

238
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:35,350
I mean, the minorities, the LGBT or LGBT in general is not a topic that is entertained.

239
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:42,040
So you can imagine a person in such a setup going to seek medical attention.

240
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:50,170
What will happen to them? So any other reviews or views about that particular media?

241
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:57,600
Yes. I mean, in the video at least say that that clinic was set up and how the doctor was seeing people, there was no privacy.

242
00:29:58,050 --> 00:30:02,100
So, I mean, for a topic that's already sensitive in that culture,

243
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:06,209
like I imagine patients would be incredibly hesitant to share that information with a

244
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:11,010
physician if they're like literally sitting beside somebody else in a hospital bed versus.

245
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:21,000
That's true. And then most of the issues in Kenya. But what we saw quite often in South Africa was people would give HIV to a clinic,

246
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,270
which was outside of what it looks like to take a bus like an hour or 2 hours away.

247
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:33,720
So because the lack of privacy that they wouldn't be seen by the family and their neighbors and their friends, that's something you don't want.

248
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:43,090
Mm hmm. Any other. Anyway, this move on LGBT health.

249
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:51,220
So this, on my own personal findings is limited information in terms of data intensive research.

250
00:30:51,730 --> 00:31:00,309
And then the available information or data proves that they face discrimination when it comes to access to health care services for 47% of

251
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:09,310
transgender individuals say they experience some form of negative or discriminatory treatment from a doctor or a health care provider.

252
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:16,870
And I'm assuming all of you ask health care providers that don't do that because you percent of LGBT individuals see,

253
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:22,540
we have avoided doctor's office in order to avoid experiencing discrimination.

254
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:32,770
That's a huge jump up 20%, 6060 7% of those hospitals that publish or provide an anti-discrimination policy will claim to

255
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:40,090
have a patient nondiscrimination policy that includes both sexual orientation and gender identity.

256
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:49,510
73% of transgender Americans say they believe they would be refused medical services because of their LGBT status.

257
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:58,750
16% of all LGBT Americans have postponed or they have not tried preventive screenings because of disrespect from.

258
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:03,350
I'm the same from you, but here's for health care providers.

259
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:09,920
And then 29 of them, as we put it, expensing discrimination in the past year.

260
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:18,340
Small forward. How does this framework look for the LGBT?

261
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:28,420
This is their identities. And then how stress is exposed, felt, ostracized, these false faces and then is proximal.

262
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:40,060
Proximal is ala concealment. Internalized homophobia is told is baby discrimination, harassment, physical violence, all of that.

263
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:44,500
And then how do they get support from peers and family?

264
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:48,820
Access to technology, most of them resort to online.

265
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:58,720
They do self-medication from you know, they go online, Google, whatever you are suffering from and then you get attention from that.

266
00:32:59,050 --> 00:33:02,290
And then what is the outcome? Physical sexual health problems.

267
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:11,660
Mental health problems, physical security. Forms of discrimination that they face when it comes to access to health care services,

268
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:17,870
those legal barriers, financial barriers, cultural, structural and lack of proper education.

269
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:22,900
This direct and indirect discrimination. So I don't know if you guys have groups.

270
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:27,500
I wanted us to discuss some of these obstacles in our various groups.

271
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:42,680
We don't have subgroups. Maybe if you just got a little of five or maybe five.

272
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:50,209
Yeah, because 3 minutes, okay.

273
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:58,010
Like three or 4 minutes of discussion. Yeah. So you can choose any that you wish to analyze or rather look into.

274
00:33:58,010 --> 00:34:04,830
And then we will discuss that if you have any of that discussion that you wish to also discuss about it,

275
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:34,400
that's something that there was more than one illness, which is like how many works?

276
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:43,820
I'm trying to work in health care insurance.

277
00:34:46,390 --> 00:35:03,230
I'm definitely working on this one and just physically trying to do a lot of research.

278
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:08,510
So we have a great group. So can you hear me? Yeah, that's.

279
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:12,090
I really like that there is. Great.

280
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:26,360
I'm going to go down there.

281
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:34,760
So what we're seeing is. Oh, I'm sorry, but you can just excel there.

282
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:44,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

283
00:35:45,170 --> 00:36:07,940
So I was talking about, you know, like for another two years I've gotten out of the private sector.

284
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:16,830
But it's interesting that you saw the leader or just general.

285
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:27,230
Yeah. I mean, I don't want you to be going obituary, obituaries and how are you going to get involved?

286
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:41,540
What is that?

287
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:52,700
There's more government representation.

288
00:36:53,330 --> 00:37:08,800
Is there another better structure moving out of San Diego?

289
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:17,000
These things? Yeah. Yeah, I got it covered up.

290
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:47,480
Oh, you know, when you look at the even if you don't know if you are being asked to consent to write in your body and say,

291
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:53,840
okay, so we've just got to wrap up in the next.

292
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:19,840
Okay. Awesome. So I think just like we normally do, if we can go to Europe.

293
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:31,410
Go around to every group and every group can report back. So when you start.

294
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:42,630
We talk about cultural and religious prejudice like we saw, and we're still playing that way.

295
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:44,270
And so that's a barrier.

296
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:53,360
But also we talk about how when she was a nurse and the patient didn't want to be touched by her, the interest in her sister, she was a patient.

297
00:38:53,900 --> 00:39:00,750
They may be unwilling to provide her care. Have you had?

298
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:06,390
Oh, you did? Okay. Next group.

299
00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:12,549
We just kind of talked about more like a clinical setting, like what?

300
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:17,820
Like lack of inclusivity looks like in like forms of like medical options.

301
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:22,420
Like Kristen brought up that like people who are gender nonconforming might be transgender,

302
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:27,730
that can't get gender affirming care from their medical providers,

303
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:33,069
might see like testosterone treatments or something like outside of a medical setting.

304
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:36,370
And that can become dangerous if you don't know where you're getting that from.

305
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:41,620
And then we also kind of talked about like more from like in order to expand like in the U.S.

306
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:49,989
Like if you go to like a OB-GYN or something, a lot of definitions of like sexual health are based off of like what we see as heteronormative sex.

307
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:54,549
And there's really not any wiggle room to, like, redefine what sex means to people.

308
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:59,550
And so that leaves a lot of gaps. And then pretty.

309
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:09,000
And it's also groups like People under 18 or whatever that might be in Kenya

310
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:12,870
whose parents might come into the doctor's office that are in there with them.

311
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:17,700
Like they're not going to be as inclined to share that information with a physician if their parents sitting there.

312
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:28,870
I did discuss with the parent. That's The Chronicle.

313
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:38,190
All right. Well, we're still talking about the lack of health care provider patients, whereas in the U.S.,

314
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:43,080
for instance, there is no federal regulation of medical schools to teach about your health.

315
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:50,050
So a lot of doctors are being graduated without knowledge of proper treatment, this community.

316
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:58,500
And then on top of that, the textbook also does not provide any samples of how that condition may affect some of them, but ultimately community.

317
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:04,780
And then to also observe how ultimately members may seek care somewhere else.

318
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:10,890
So they also have the structural barriers or how they have to travel somewhere else to find someone like themselves.

319
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:16,650
To be able to seek proper care. And it's not just medical schools.

320
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:21,610
There's no requirement in the MPH program. We added this session for the first time.

321
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:31,600
This semester hasn't been disclosed. Imagine if anybody wants to learn, but take more courses on LGBT LGBT health.

322
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:37,790
Gary Harper in Speech is fantastic looking at his courses or you know, Gary.

323
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:43,120
Yes, he is amazing. Yeah. Look at him.

324
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:52,090
He's absolutely fantastic. Thank you. So just like you said, like in Kenya, we have all this legal barriers.

325
00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:55,890
The law does not recognize homosexuals.

326
00:41:56,320 --> 00:42:02,530
So it's actually a very big challenge and access to all of those financial barriers.

327
00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:10,540
For example, the Ministry of Health does not allocate funds, supports, you know, their access to healthcare services.

328
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:15,160
Cultural. Religious. Very common in. I mean.

329
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:21,350
Yeah. Christianity. Hmm. Yeah.

330
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:29,560
Structural barriers. I mean, you walk into a hospital, you expect someone to address you as who you are,

331
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:35,230
but they end up, you know, is growing was or lack of health care provider education.

332
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:38,980
Most of our schools actually don't teach about homosexuality.

333
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:49,000
It's a crime. It's immoral. I mean, if you go direct and indirect discrimination, you know what that means.

334
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:58,690
Uh huh. So I also did just mention what I was talking about in terms of the curriculum in our schools.

335
00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:11,530
Lack of specific knowledge. Yes, LGBT organizations like the minority, like lack of the monitoring and surveillance state.

336
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:20,530
Yes. The mismatch between the legislative. Yes, there are countries that have laws that protects, but on the ground, things are very different.

337
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:29,860
You know that. Yes. So it is actually about experiences of LGBT community when it comes to access to healthcare services.

338
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:45,410
Also, we can do 3 minutes. That's one.

339
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:05,060
This is. Why doesn't every home in the U.S. have solar?

340
00:44:05,930 --> 00:44:08,990
The reason it's is a great question.

341
00:44:35,930 --> 00:44:40,820
A few years ago, I was diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome and.

342
00:44:44,490 --> 00:44:51,120
The doctors who treated me wanted to treat me as if I was a cisgendered woman who wanted to have kids.

343
00:44:51,630 --> 00:44:56,910
And didn't really take into account that that's not necessarily the way I identified or what I wanted.

344
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:01,230
Early on coming out, I had a negative experience.

345
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:08,520
Actually, during my first stint in the middle of it started asking me questions about my sexuality and

346
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:16,319
then giving me quite a lecture about morals and about what was right and wrong to do with sex,

347
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:23,820
and about letting down my parents all in the middle of the procedure, which is a really sort of traumatic experience.

348
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:35,060
Just after I received my positive diagnosis for HIV, I sought the services of a critique, you know,

349
00:45:35,070 --> 00:45:45,720
as basically the assumption was made that I was just basically wrong choice of having unprotected sex when actually the case was sexually assaulted.

350
00:45:46,290 --> 00:45:47,640
So I contracted HIV.

351
00:45:48,450 --> 00:45:56,250
When I came out, I had a lot of issues with my family and then accepting that, which led to a few years being estranged with my mother in particular.

352
00:45:56,670 --> 00:46:02,400
And to rebuild that relationship, we had actually mediated sessions with the therapist.

353
00:46:02,910 --> 00:46:10,540
And this issue became about how I'd left my mother in the dark and how I'd done right by her.

354
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:22,650
I ended up in a psychiatric ward where the doctors refused to acknowledge AIDS trends and used the Koreans to deliberately.

355
00:46:25,670 --> 00:46:35,020
I've never had a good experience in. Maybe feel like I can trust countries.

356
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:43,590
They feel like I had very much really who I am and just pretend to be normal, I guess.

357
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:48,780
This experience made me feel really vulnerable and not safe in my vulnerability.

358
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:53,160
And. This experience that we tried to humanize.

359
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:58,630
You made me feel like I wasn't worth as much as other patients.

360
00:47:01,690 --> 00:47:09,770
I had one. Really? Really. Any response to this as well.

361
00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:16,880
I know not everybody will be working in the clinical setting, some of you, but most of you will be population health level stuff.

362
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:20,720
So think about when you're conducting surveys, doing surveillance activities.

363
00:47:21,530 --> 00:47:31,100
This. Data on sexual identity or orientation or gender expression has probably never been collected in most populations,

364
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:32,930
and it's going to be difficult to do that.

365
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:39,710
You know, a lot of times when I'm conducting surveys, I go and I ask people, what gender do you identify in very different places?

366
00:47:39,710 --> 00:47:44,420
What gender do you identify as is your spouse? What's that sex and that kind of thing?

367
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:50,959
People fight back against that. But it's really important that you advocate when you're collecting data to include

368
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:54,500
all of these different variables and all these different demographic data points.

369
00:47:56,250 --> 00:48:00,390
Q Any comments about the video we've just watched?

370
00:48:03,210 --> 00:48:09,040
Any comments? What is the emotion in the room?

371
00:48:15,490 --> 00:48:20,350
Very disappointed, but not surprised because medical school is very hierarchical, very wise.

372
00:48:22,310 --> 00:48:29,150
It was not the first analysis that. Any other motions?

373
00:48:29,450 --> 00:48:37,610
Any other comments? And it's it's also amplified even more in other countries.

374
00:48:37,650 --> 00:48:45,800
My mother went to medical school in Pakistan. They only allowed 25% of people admitted to be women semi-trucks and had to be met.

375
00:48:46,670 --> 00:48:52,710
And that happens, you know, quite often as well all around the world. All right.

376
00:48:53,850 --> 00:48:57,150
Mental health and addiction among the LGBT community.

377
00:48:57,390 --> 00:49:01,680
Is it just statistics? 4.5, of course, of the U.S. population?

378
00:49:01,690 --> 00:49:06,630
This is. I think as a to 2005 Starbucks.

379
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:14,520
So for what, 4.5 of the U.S. population, which is nearly 10 million people, is LGBT.

380
00:49:15,570 --> 00:49:22,140
A lot of them experience mental illness, 60% more than heterosexuals.

381
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:28,350
And 2 to 3 are more likely to have long term psychological or emotional problems.

382
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:34,860
And then transgender people tend suicide nine times more than the entire U.S. population.

383
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:41,430
LGBT adults are 56% more likely to develop alcohol abuse.

384
00:49:41,910 --> 00:49:45,720
And then there's also the same.

385
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:51,210
Almost three times as likely to develop another substance abuse disorder.

386
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:57,110
HIV and AIDS among them as well.

387
00:49:58,340 --> 00:50:06,770
Most new HIV diagnosis among is among many that you tend to know, not know sexual contact.

388
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:10,280
And you can see the figures as well. 81% notes.

389
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:14,360
No sexual contacts. 10% heterosexual.

390
00:50:14,810 --> 00:50:19,030
Five injection and all that. Mm hmm.

391
00:50:19,810 --> 00:50:23,680
Now, let's talk about monkeypox. The current outbreak.

392
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:35,560
I believe you went through the materials I sent, and I wanted us to look through some of these questions and answer them.

393
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:41,270
When did the US response begin? What is the main focus?

394
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:45,710
Who are the most affected? And what are some of the input agencies?

395
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:50,240
What is the status of monkeypox testing, for example, in this country?

396
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:55,040
What is the supply of the vaccines? Is that federal funding?

397
00:50:55,700 --> 00:51:02,420
And what are the means of communication? So I don't know if we'll go into our groups as well.

398
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:10,000
I. You're looking at some three or 4 minutes of difficult.

399
00:51:19,170 --> 00:51:29,300
One turned out to be better your vaccine card.

400
00:51:31,180 --> 00:51:38,150
And we didn't know we could be done in the next 10 minutes.

401
00:51:38,870 --> 00:51:57,670
Old age. But I think they want us to excel in the proof of just because that clears up your education.

402
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:02,800
Second time, some of the 20 minutes. We don't know what you mean.

403
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:13,550
Oh, okay. I like that more very well, because agency and something else are going to be talking about if you're going to call.

404
00:52:17,330 --> 00:52:24,360
You know, that was something I think I saw that in a few years ago in general,

405
00:52:25,010 --> 00:52:40,999
even when it was more like like a couple months before going to be the other ones in New York and everywhere else.

406
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,299
And it was just representation, I guess. I don't know.

407
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:47,690
But that doesn't make a difference.

408
00:52:49,450 --> 00:52:55,600
Yeah. You know, I mean, the or something,

409
00:52:55,680 --> 00:53:10,580
you can look a certain way and it's pretty clear that some people think they're obviously she has been at the grocery store.

410
00:53:10,990 --> 00:53:30,360
She is completely free of there.

411
00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:39,530
Yeah. I don't know how they focus.

412
00:53:39,970 --> 00:53:52,250
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

413
00:53:52,480 --> 00:54:07,750
So my sister and I said, yeah, that's the basis that we are like, Oh, great.

414
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:23,060
I felt like I was very explicitly that and it was like, Yeah, know, just about one more minute.

415
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:42,250
So can I just the General Motors and not real money in your life and like how do you want me to do anything?

416
00:54:43,810 --> 00:54:58,040
I gave him like an instrumental Bible study sitting next to somebody on the train.

417
00:54:58,040 --> 00:55:13,940
And then just like in the third draft, he had no chance of doing it also before.

418
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:19,040
Okay. So let's start maybe from that side.

419
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:37,350
You're going to start on. You're looking for some sort of brief overview of the questions.

420
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:41,650
One of the points of focus that we talked about was that.

421
00:55:43,710 --> 00:55:48,750
Monkeypox and the virus itself can infect anyone.

422
00:55:48,750 --> 00:55:56,250
But the response from the U.S. and other restaurant countries has been to stigmatize the LGBT community,

423
00:55:56,250 --> 00:56:02,650
particularly networks of men and sex workers as well. But we wanted to make the point clear that if.

424
00:56:04,210 --> 00:56:10,900
Any population or whatever population that the virus first infected in the US, for example,

425
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:17,290
is the one that's going to be most affected and that's why vaccines are being distributed and prioritized for them right now.

426
00:56:17,770 --> 00:56:19,610
But the messaging as well,

427
00:56:19,630 --> 00:56:29,740
messaging is harmful and that it's saying that those people are the source of the infection when in reality anyone is susceptible to infection.

428
00:56:31,450 --> 00:56:39,000
What else? We noted that the US response began not long ago, in June or July of this year.

429
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:47,370
Very limited testing available. There's only five laboratories in the US.

430
00:56:50,650 --> 00:56:57,250
Monkeypox vaccine supply was also an issue in terms of production, but also stockpiling by wealthier nations.

431
00:57:01,430 --> 00:57:04,690
Other's answer. Yeah, I'm just on first, though.

432
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:09,170
So you spoke about how it's going to be stigmatized and they say it's the disease.

433
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:12,470
Most effects like men of sex, men and sexual abuse.

434
00:57:13,550 --> 00:57:20,030
What do you think that means to people who think they might have monkeypox, for example, might not have come out yet or might,

435
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:25,340
you know, just don't want people to think that they might have been MSM or sex work or something like that.

436
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,450
How do you think that kind of impact surveillance efforts and response efforts?

437
00:57:30,110 --> 00:57:38,480
I think there's a clear hesitation in terms of reporting your case and also for spreading it to anyone that you've been in close contact with as well.

438
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:42,710
So there's also a lack of data collection if you're not reporting your individual case,

439
00:57:43,570 --> 00:57:47,330
and that's sort of biasing the data collection towards groups that are reporting.

440
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:58,450
Yes, absolutely. Okay.

441
00:57:59,350 --> 00:58:05,400
So I'm not just German, but kind of like echoing a lot of what we just said.

442
00:58:05,410 --> 00:58:10,209
Like we all kind of started like hearing about the U.S., like acknowledging it.

443
00:58:10,210 --> 00:58:18,730
It's not like notices and like it being in the news here when it kind of started to manifest in Europe like mid this year.

444
00:58:19,270 --> 00:58:23,830
And that was like really the first we heard of the US being concerned about it really at all.

445
00:58:24,430 --> 00:58:30,729
And then for the vaccine like just like supply shortages like again like we had mentioned,

446
00:58:30,730 --> 00:58:36,250
like Jacob had mentioned that he had read somewhere that there like a lot of like the U.S. stockpile of vaccines,

447
00:58:36,250 --> 00:58:41,140
like Congress isn't willing to like bite the bullet on actually spending the money to ship them here.

448
00:58:41,470 --> 00:58:50,350
And so that's causing a supply chain issue just because it's not prioritized in that way, and especially that for the vaccine.

449
00:58:50,590 --> 00:58:55,479
Rachel had mentioned that like in the email that the university sent out about potentially getting a vaccine,

450
00:58:55,480 --> 00:59:04,420
there is a list of requirements for eligibility and they were pretty like along the lines of what we would talk about being stigmatizing.

451
00:59:04,420 --> 00:59:10,690
Like if you're a man who had sex with a man and you've had X amount of sexual partners in a certain time period

452
00:59:12,100 --> 00:59:17,020
so that the vaccine isn't like they're not communicating the message that anybody can contract monkeypox.

453
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:25,650
Like they're really like honing in on the fact that this population and then on the public communication and stuff like that, we were just saying,

454
00:59:25,690 --> 00:59:29,769
like we all see like reputable journals and stuff like that that we typically

455
00:59:29,770 --> 00:59:35,380
would trust debating if it is like an X or should be classified as just an SGI.

456
00:59:35,590 --> 00:59:44,170
And we're kind of unsure where that's coming from because it's restricted and it obviously can contract it outside of sexual acts, but then also.

457
00:59:46,620 --> 00:59:52,199
That's just also that that does it send the message to people who maybe haven't had sex or something like that,

458
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:55,530
that they're immune and that they're safe and don't need to be worried about.

459
00:59:59,820 --> 01:00:02,660
To say something before we proceed to through.

460
01:00:03,220 --> 01:00:11,500
No, I think I mean, some things you were saying last time and it was interesting, you brought up the universes kind of picture of vaccinations.

461
01:00:11,890 --> 01:00:14,950
I will touch on this actually probably in the next lecture.

462
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:19,390
But I'm saying, you know, I mean, it makes sense why they have all these criteria, but then, you know,

463
01:00:19,430 --> 01:00:24,480
them saying go ahead for the sake of vaccination, essentially having the same thing, go here.

464
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:28,239
If you're a MSM who's had sex like some people today.

465
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:32,049
So there's certain ways of doing it which are difficult vaccine.

466
01:00:32,050 --> 01:00:36,820
No right or wrong answer, but it's something to keep in mind if you're designing an intervention like that.

467
01:00:38,190 --> 01:00:43,360
I had a question actually about that. You mentioned what is the set of some of the sexting?

468
01:00:43,380 --> 01:00:51,650
And when you say multiple sex, is that an attempt to screen for monkeypox or to see like,

469
01:00:51,650 --> 01:00:57,710
oh, I think it was kind of potential cases of monkeypox by patients.

470
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:11,960
I think generally everything is I mean, I don't know that the who, when declared, kind of looking at it as like a public health emergency.

471
01:01:12,890 --> 01:01:22,200
And I think it was I think they had two testing kits in place at the time they're being distributed.

472
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:25,520
I don't know if it was in the US alone or around the world globally.

473
01:01:27,050 --> 01:01:35,210
So I mean, that was, I think declared and I mean, that was good because technologically speaking that was nice to have.

474
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:44,740
And in the previous pandemic with COVID, I think that it was like, I think a step forward in terms of technological advances.

475
01:01:44,750 --> 01:01:54,680
So I think with the pandemic was to say that, you know, that that won't push things forward in terms of technology.

476
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:59,000
So it's interesting. You mentioned different screening and diagnostics.

477
01:02:00,070 --> 01:02:09,690
You have you learned about a difference between screening and diagnostic test at the primary versus secondary tertiary?

478
01:02:09,690 --> 01:02:18,230
It's sort of the same if the primary is going like look at disease early or preventing disease secondary.

479
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:26,120
So that screening is kind of like a low cost way of looking for disease and it's very sensitive,

480
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:32,600
which means you will find a lot of diseases that it's not very specific to get a lot of false false positives.

481
01:02:33,140 --> 01:02:37,700
So screen might be, which actually I think is something like this, the CDC, monkeypox,

482
01:02:38,030 --> 01:02:45,370
if you've been exposed and you have a new rash and one of another symptoms, you screen positive monkeypox.

483
01:02:46,850 --> 01:02:49,250
Anyway, monkeypox probably falls into that category,

484
01:02:49,550 --> 01:02:53,959
but you're going to have a lot of people who don't have monkeypox at all in that category, which you have screen.

485
01:02:53,960 --> 01:03:03,190
It's so public, you're just finding anyone who has it and you're like, okay, well, be sacrificing specificity, finding elasticity.

486
01:03:04,370 --> 01:03:07,180
Then the diagnostic test is like the perfect temperature.

487
01:03:07,190 --> 01:03:14,650
Play a PCR and then you actually find out who is properly positive and properly negative that.

488
01:03:16,700 --> 01:03:26,520
But we discussed a lot of what are and so there's a stigma around sex with men past.

489
01:03:26,690 --> 01:03:33,740
And I would add I guess my perspective about technological advancement brought about

490
01:03:34,010 --> 01:03:40,590
by folks probably less likely than COVID because of COVID if they were pushing this.

491
01:03:40,950 --> 01:03:50,780
Like anyone can get it because they're leaking this to men who have sex with men, it's not going to be as much of a push to get someone to.

492
01:03:54,530 --> 01:04:07,820
Right. Well, I think that's a very powerful incentive possible because you have a small population, as is pushed with the.

493
01:04:10,010 --> 01:04:15,410
More of like a social population than what's political power.

494
01:04:16,430 --> 01:04:19,460
Well, that covered mostly affects elderly white men.

495
01:04:19,700 --> 01:04:24,260
So of course politicians. But the fact that it's minority probably not.

496
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:34,630
Okay. So there's a lot of politics as well as some of the.

497
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:48,780
But the proof of teaching is not being able to use it.

498
01:04:50,460 --> 01:04:54,120
What are we going to do as everybody video? No, no, no.

499
01:04:54,120 --> 01:05:05,020
It's too much of an aspect of. So this is just general findings that it will output again in 2022.

500
01:05:06,590 --> 01:05:17,690
Direct contact with infectious states or body fluids in the US, 99% of the cases will in men, 94% of them with some movement.

501
01:05:17,930 --> 01:05:21,680
It's not like many is saying there's a lot of politics around that.

502
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:26,399
But I do want to talk about 2015.

503
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:38,270
The US tends to when the reports say that 85% why we need insurance cover up over months 55% were denied coverage for gender affirming surgery.

504
01:05:38,780 --> 01:05:47,270
33% of those who saw a healthcare provider reported being refused treatment, not only harassed, physically or sexually abused,

505
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:56,310
and then just 3% did not seek needed care because of fear of mistreatment from healthcare providers.

506
01:05:57,110 --> 01:05:59,690
What are some of the consequences of the discrimination?

507
01:06:00,380 --> 01:06:10,880
LGBT people tend to avoid regular access to healthcare, and so, like you said, they switch to social media, a social media technology, technology.

508
01:06:11,270 --> 01:06:15,380
They showed abuse involvement in screening programs and checkups.

509
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:20,360
They also receive listed issues that lead to higher rates of.

510
01:06:21,460 --> 01:06:26,110
How do you pronounce that? What is it? What is co-morbidity?

511
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:32,370
That disease that's happening in Africa.

512
01:06:32,390 --> 01:06:36,280
The current is that you have. Okay. Yes.

513
01:06:36,310 --> 01:06:39,980
That's what's co-morbidity, right? Yeah. Okay.

514
01:06:40,460 --> 01:06:42,670
Yeah. What is the solution?

515
01:06:42,670 --> 01:06:51,520
When it came up with healthcare spaces to be really to promote a culture of inclusion, mental health, mental health support systems,

516
01:06:51,850 --> 01:07:01,440
more funding, some programs, medical support, LGBT and healthcare services, and then investing in this safety.

517
01:07:04,910 --> 01:07:11,719
Africa. Africa, where I come from, LGBT people, especially those living in Africa,

518
01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:17,720
are particularly touched by such multiple and intersectional vulnerabilities.

519
01:07:18,140 --> 01:07:21,790
And these are excerpts from newspapers in Uganda.

520
01:07:22,220 --> 01:07:25,580
Have you ever heard of Uganda? You know Uganda, right?

521
01:07:26,060 --> 01:07:29,650
The country. So one of the newspapers headline.

522
01:07:30,530 --> 01:07:35,960
Well, they are up our kids and anyone exposed.

523
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:47,620
Hmm. So do you think someone who identifies as an LGBT will come out in such a set up to look for health care services?

524
01:07:48,580 --> 01:07:52,150
Would you come out of the closet behind?

525
01:07:52,180 --> 01:07:57,100
Come on, guys. Uh huh. The public service is my friend.

526
01:07:58,210 --> 01:08:04,840
She's called Sheila. Sheila lost her life two months ago.

527
01:08:05,470 --> 01:08:11,830
She was actually brutally murdered because of her sexual orientation from Kenya.

528
01:08:12,430 --> 01:08:21,790
So that shows you how tough it is to identify as a sexual minority in Africa.

529
01:08:22,670 --> 01:08:28,000
Now this is where we talk about the film that I sent you guys graphically.

530
01:08:29,090 --> 01:08:33,390
What are your opinions? Anything.

531
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:38,580
Anything. I won't have to. What do you think of our.

532
01:08:39,070 --> 01:08:50,590
So I'm from Brazil. So they like our current president there because they know Brazil is tends to be more accepted in China

533
01:08:50,590 --> 01:08:56,990
for instance with she'll have a lot of hours between us being murdered before it's like go where they go.

534
01:08:57,010 --> 01:09:03,610
One of them, they have to go through some power control stream that would just see your couples for like the alliance,

535
01:09:03,610 --> 01:09:08,790
the ones who have things in their heads to strengthen about them, like, you know, this kind of artists.

536
01:09:09,730 --> 01:09:20,530
And I know that in the northeast region of people murder group and murder of transgender folks and just dump their bodies in the rivers and all that.

537
01:09:20,530 --> 01:09:22,480
So I saw some similarities,

538
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:30,550
but then I also enjoy them over to a point that was very racial racial unrest level worse to all the elements mobs out there.

539
01:09:30,790 --> 01:09:35,270
So I really appreciate it. And because it shows how this actually happened in China.

540
01:09:35,290 --> 01:09:37,520
And if we don't have this notion that, you know,

541
01:09:37,540 --> 01:09:43,150
other countries out of which is members have pretty much as they have in the U.S. or Western tourists.

542
01:09:51,270 --> 01:09:54,470
I really appreciated the fact that it is on the hopeful note.

543
01:09:55,790 --> 01:10:03,260
A lot of times like when you have like LGBTQ films which are like not those or something that is like pillow

544
01:10:03,290 --> 01:10:08,089
suffering and then there's no like resolution up then and it's like everything is always going to be terrible.

545
01:10:08,090 --> 01:10:13,640
So I really appreciate the fact that that did and I hope that the doom and gloom.

546
01:10:13,790 --> 01:10:28,159
Yeah, but then the other comments, I also the addition of having the men in the community that everyone knew was homosexual.

547
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:36,860
And so she had to sort of be complicit in France talking about him and she couldn't say anything.

548
01:10:36,860 --> 01:10:41,580
And so she was sort of complicit in in that speech because there was no other option for her.

549
01:10:41,970 --> 01:10:46,700
Yeah. And of course, many of my own friends have had similar experiences.

550
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:54,120
And you're. And.

551
01:10:56,440 --> 01:11:09,740
If possible. I was just looking at the headlines and it's really it's really kind of like kind of like right now within certain.

552
01:11:11,420 --> 01:11:15,710
I know you do a lot of politics which isn't like our political.

553
01:11:16,890 --> 01:11:26,560
Parties or one of the political parties. Yeah, it's really just reminiscent of an.

554
01:11:26,580 --> 01:11:30,240
And can you speak more? Well.

555
01:11:32,970 --> 01:11:38,879
Well, yeah, cause like, there's now this I mean, it's always been like a thing,

556
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:42,870
like how like people are ultimately trying to bring their children and,

557
01:11:43,230 --> 01:11:47,879
you know, do like all these horrible children that's kind of had a that's an that's always been an issue,

558
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:53,240
but now it's kind of having this, like, resurgence of especially like, um,

559
01:11:53,580 --> 01:11:59,909
like there's this whole thing about, like having LGBT, like, teachers in the classroom.

560
01:11:59,910 --> 01:12:04,880
So, um. So what if they're like, they're, they're after your kids?

561
01:12:04,930 --> 01:12:07,950
Like, oh, like, that's all I know.

562
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:20,100
Yeah. Yeah. Uh huh. Especially thinking about it now and or to the point that Marcus brought up

563
01:12:20,550 --> 01:12:25,710
was the reason that I was thinking about it when I was watching it through.

564
01:12:26,610 --> 01:12:32,850
There was some cultural points that I didn't quite like watching it.

565
01:12:33,150 --> 01:12:37,980
I didn't quite pick up on that. I was wondering if they why don't they pick up on that?

566
01:12:38,550 --> 01:12:47,910
And I think that points to why the kind of racial diversity exists in the culture, electricity.

567
01:12:48,090 --> 01:12:54,670
And Marcus was alluding to and it was like, it's set in Africa, it's set somewhere else.

568
01:12:55,710 --> 01:13:01,110
And who's the director of the movie Africa is going to America here.

569
01:13:01,410 --> 01:13:05,220
I think that's why it's it's something different.

570
01:13:05,610 --> 01:13:08,970
Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's true. Yeah. And she is different.

571
01:13:11,030 --> 01:13:16,220
Okay. Okay. Yeah. Differently from own culture.

572
01:13:16,230 --> 01:13:21,370
So I was like, what the way to some of these different nuances is.

573
01:13:21,460 --> 01:13:25,660
Pick up on it. Okay. Okay. That's right.

574
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:39,870
Mhm. Mhm. Um, and why is this film allowed to be screened and can you know, was it filmed in Cannes.

575
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:46,319
Yeah, it was filmed in Kenya and then it was banned for quite some time.

576
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:55,440
And then it was, they give them like I think a week to screen in theaters and then after a week it was again, you know, funny.

577
01:13:59,810 --> 01:14:06,720
And what are the laws look like around homosexuality and how restrictive are they on Craigslist?

578
01:14:08,940 --> 01:14:12,510
They are not allowed. It's clear in the law and isn't enforced.

579
01:14:13,300 --> 01:14:19,120
It is like, for example, when. Sheila.

580
01:14:20,370 --> 01:14:27,540
She has happened when she was murdered, different LGBT communities went on the streets.

581
01:14:27,780 --> 01:14:30,840
You know, we demand for justice for Sheila.

582
01:14:32,010 --> 01:14:35,100
And they did it for a day.

583
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:40,080
And then the next day no one was on the streets and were like, Where are they?

584
01:14:40,710 --> 01:14:44,340
And reports are there that they were profiled.

585
01:14:44,340 --> 01:14:48,600
And I mean, things happened to them that we don't know.

586
01:14:50,100 --> 01:14:54,750
So it is very intense to go off.

587
01:14:54,930 --> 01:15:03,500
Well, I think while you done. Yeah. I just wanted to know if you all follow the example, the power relations separate in Brazil.

588
01:15:03,510 --> 01:15:15,950
It's totally legal to discriminate in favor of, like the political opponents or homophobic people is really, really on top of it.

589
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:22,350
Farai. So even though there is some kind of regulation, I feel like it's not everywhere going to be respected.

590
01:15:24,620 --> 01:15:28,980
Yeah, it is. So we've to consider like what's allowable and actually what's happening.

591
01:15:29,160 --> 01:15:32,600
Yeah. Always the same thing, right? Yeah. And then Chris.

592
01:15:32,610 --> 01:15:38,969
Right. Yeah. Just to get across what you're saying. What you're saying highlights how one has been arguing some of this kind of like know your own

593
01:15:38,970 --> 01:15:43,560
expertize and like what you're there for and and not try to make kind of the trouble like,

594
01:15:44,010 --> 01:15:51,600
you know, work with people who then the experts who are in the country to design your programs because, you know, coming from the U.S.,

595
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:56,040
coming from where we are going in another country, I never truly could understand what's happening over there.

596
01:15:57,210 --> 01:16:04,290
So I just want to bring up as well. Basically, it was a. I think someone that was he.

597
01:16:05,110 --> 01:16:11,850
Okay. It's not related to what we're talking about. Was the point about the movie and we talked about religion a little bit already.

598
01:16:11,950 --> 01:16:16,270
Just how the pastor was preaching that like marriage is between a man and a woman.

599
01:16:16,660 --> 01:16:23,790
And it was interesting because all the other like heterosexual relationships and chemo's like there are all kinds of like abusive,

600
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:30,010
not healthy, pretty toxic, like your parents and then like her friend and the other woman.

601
01:16:31,030 --> 01:16:37,480
And so it's interesting that that's portrayed as healthy and normal, whereas that's not reality and hypocrisy.

602
01:16:39,370 --> 01:16:44,410
Thank you. I think we need to move forward. So what happens in Kenya?

603
01:16:45,370 --> 01:16:49,850
Nephew organizations come up like men and women.

604
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:54,670
To move to is a Swahili statement or whatever phrase that means.

605
01:16:55,120 --> 01:17:04,540
Talk to your daughter. And what do they do? They offer contraceptive or family planning services, HIV, AIDS counseling, screening for breast cancer,

606
01:17:04,540 --> 01:17:11,530
cervical cancer screening, mental health support, antenatal youth club and education.

607
01:17:12,510 --> 01:17:20,130
So that's what happens. And that's one last we give up before I finish our trip.

608
01:17:20,340 --> 01:17:24,930
Do you know how the organization operates? Homosexuality is illegal in Kenya.

609
01:17:25,620 --> 01:17:29,460
How the organization operated. Homosexuality is illegal. Oh, Kenya.

610
01:17:31,950 --> 01:17:39,220
How does this operate? I think sometimes you have to go against the law and that's fine.

611
01:17:39,250 --> 01:17:44,440
I mean, obviously, if the labor police aren't coming after them.

612
01:17:47,410 --> 01:17:51,940
You know, there's a right for life or right to life for everybody.

613
01:17:52,540 --> 01:17:59,860
So despite what you are doing, it should be okay for you to I don't know.

614
01:18:01,210 --> 01:18:06,630
But I think, you know, to answer that question.

615
01:18:08,290 --> 01:18:19,300
But the thing is, they are there there are organizations that are just doing things by force or, you know, just not doing as a way Lou sees.

616
01:18:19,900 --> 01:18:23,920
And that's what I think some of them are not driving some of them.

617
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:32,080
And, you know, you have to know someone for you to you know, there's that thing about if you know someone, you can do something.

618
01:18:32,350 --> 01:18:33,790
And especially if it's, you know,

619
01:18:33,790 --> 01:18:43,420
bringing money to the country or to the people or and the people who are benefiting from it know people who are poor these or they know.

620
01:18:43,450 --> 01:18:51,310
So there's all those things that are involved. So despite the losses, this whatever is in the ground is sometimes very different.

621
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,879
Yep. So does this work?

622
01:18:54,880 --> 01:19:04,000
Still are finished with health care systems and health care providers hold a crucial role in the fight against transphobic discrimination.

623
01:19:04,820 --> 01:19:11,250
Fundamental social actors need to be principal interlocutors of LGBT politics.

624
01:19:11,770 --> 01:19:23,170
They can also provide a solid contribution in transforming laws into practices, becoming reference points for activists, and, if needed,

625
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:36,300
being the light in the of the light at the end of the tunnel for LGBT patients as the end and as of video clip,

626
01:19:36,310 --> 01:19:42,549
I don't know what that is on the phone, but we can I don't know.

627
01:19:42,550 --> 01:19:50,210
I just want to add maybe 2 minutes to. Is basically something to do with.

628
01:19:58,350 --> 01:20:01,780
I mean, there is a major thing. I mean, we ought to have a different path.

629
01:20:02,630 --> 01:20:07,110
You know, a tremendous difference between what it is and what it's like for how it's affecting.

630
01:20:09,550 --> 01:20:13,290
And you can show them. I work at the university.

631
01:20:13,650 --> 01:20:17,150
We. I think I've done some.

632
01:20:17,170 --> 01:20:27,430
It is good. Any question for Nancy? The questions.

633
01:20:28,420 --> 01:20:32,410
Will, thank you very much.

634
01:20:34,310 --> 01:20:39,670
So. That is all for today.

635
01:20:40,360 --> 01:20:46,900
We'll be back here on Thursday. On Thursday, we will have guest speakers on humanitarian aid coming in.

636
01:20:47,350 --> 01:20:50,350
So one person just in the act would be a young person.

637
01:20:50,650 --> 01:20:57,520
He's responded to a million different imagined emergencies lasting 15, 20 years for this kid.

638
01:20:57,940 --> 01:21:01,540
We'll also have Suzanne Angel. She's such a badass. She's amazing.

639
01:21:02,070 --> 01:21:09,000
Well, for you and for like ten years that she moved International Medical Corps and the health program over there,

640
01:21:09,030 --> 01:21:18,160
now she has a visa to back in the UK. And Richard Golden, who's a professor of disastrous principle in the university in the UK.

641
01:21:19,330 --> 01:21:22,330
So I will see you all on Thursday next week.

642
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:27,879
Not this week. And yet that is all.

643
01:21:27,880 --> 01:21:36,960
So take care. Have a good few days. No, no, no, no.
