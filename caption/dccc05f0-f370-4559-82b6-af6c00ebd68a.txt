1
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:06,470
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:14,280
I got it right the first time.

3
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:21,900
It's the second quarter comedy clubs.

4
00:00:26,390 --> 00:01:23,730
Right. Okay. Oh, I'm so excited because like, you know, I have to be like, all right, that's where I'm together.

5
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:43,070
So it's like, yeah, so yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

6
00:01:43,170 --> 00:02:01,980
And the new people, I have another team in my life just because I take care of the stars for the audio line.

7
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:11,850
Oh, that's cool. I would like to be, you know.

8
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:25,140
Oh, my God. Yeah. I was like, Yeah, because I was not thinking about what happened yesterday.

9
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:33,959
There was an overpass and stuff like that about the past time.

10
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:48,780
It's time for the party.

11
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:59,700
So now I'm just, you know that that's not true.

12
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:17,100
Yeah. You know, it's like you're like, oh, my God.

13
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:26,070
Oh, my favorite half of it. Because I guess she was out on it.

14
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:45,780
But I did. I got in touch with I don't think I was I feel like a little uneasy when I was like, I can't really think of the last people to get here.

15
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:49,540
Look at me. First of all.

16
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:57,150
Such. The screen is all I've taught in this room many years.

17
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:03,850
I think it's been 3 to 4 years since that screen moved back to the top down.

18
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:17,320
Make my life enormously easier and I'm very happy right now. You know, 4 hours a day you have really, I think, a lot about sort of audience and goals.

19
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:23,770
Most of what you have to do is actually watch videos of me doing lectures on this topic,

20
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:29,020
which is not usually what I'm going to ask you to do, but I happen to have these videos from a previous class.

21
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:33,580
There's one reading on YouTube audience personas.

22
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:41,120
This sometimes leads to some confusion, sort of like, what are we supposed to write our musings about?

23
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,899
Remember? For Thursday. Tomorrow by four.

24
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,340
You need to write your musings.

25
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:55,700
What I want you to do is to write about some kind of a situation where you saw health communication misaligned with its audience.

26
00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:03,050
So think about a situation in which you've seen a communication where, you know, they just didn't.

27
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:11,510
If there were some mismatch between the characteristics of the audience in any way, shape or form and the design of the communication.

28
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:17,960
I want to try and get as many examples of situations where we have those kinds of mismatches that we can talk about in class on Thursday.

29
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:22,250
After that, however, the musings are really going to be grounded in the readings.

30
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:28,280
So for the most part, I just want you to be thinking about stuff that pops up as you're doing the readings.

31
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:34,010
Make sure you got the book. We will be reading from it for next Tuesday.

32
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:39,500
So there's lots of verses around it. And I think I think somebody found it.

33
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:45,469
You found the link to the audio version that is available through something in the U of M.

34
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:52,250
And if you want to try and get a hold of that, I get the links for that. I actually keep a copy of this book on a regular basis and refer to it.

35
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:59,750
So I think it's worth if you're the kind of person like you want to use a book as a reference tool to get it and it shouldn't be hard.

36
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:05,899
But if you run into trouble, I mean, know. All right. Today, as I said up here, don't get settled.

37
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,120
We're going to be moving because I'm going to break it up into groups.

38
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:18,200
As promised, I have chocolates as incentive to make sure that you engage in this task.

39
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:24,740
So what are you going to do today? I'm going to pass out these once we break up into groups.

40
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:29,000
I'm going to break this up at the six groups. And.

41
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:37,710
Take some order to go in, it doesn't really matter. And then to do is I will be timing all this sort of shout out.

42
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:44,910
Okay 3 to 1 start. One person goes for reads off or gives off their speech.

43
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:51,629
Everybody else listens. All you have to do is write down on these rating sheets a 0 to 10 rating of.

44
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:54,690
How persuasive did that speech feel?

45
00:06:56,250 --> 00:07:00,960
Notice. Remember, I'm not actually caring at this point about what you're arguing.

46
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:06,050
You can be arguing for making Lyme disease a public health priority.

47
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:09,780
You can be arguing against making Lyme disease as a public health service.

48
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:13,980
What I want you to be thinking about as you're listening to these speeches is, are you being moved?

49
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:18,350
And pay attention to like what are the different things that people are doing?

50
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:24,380
Part of the purpose of this assignment is to get you to recognize there's lots of different ways to take the same topic and approach them.

51
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:28,100
Where to do this.

52
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:35,470
And we're going to look at some public service announcements, the middle class, and then I've got another activity towards the end of the class.

53
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:44,259
So that's the goal for today. Just get us sort of thinking through different ways of being persuasive, however, to get us going on this.

54
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:50,920
I want to break you break us up into six groups and basically use the room as best as possible.

55
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:58,630
So like group one or number one over here to in the back quarter, there's three here, four in the back corner.

56
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:05,800
That's the middle five. Six. Feel free to move the tables, rearrange the chairs.

57
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:11,380
We got to put it back at the end. But we'll make little circles so that you're going to be facing each other as you're talking.

58
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:17,140
Okay. What am I to do with my. Count us off. So, however, if you would start.

59
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:22,180
Count one, two, three, four, six.

60
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:25,810
One, two, three, four, five, six.

61
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:29,380
One, two, three, four, five, six.

62
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:34,239
One, two, three, four, five, six.

63
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,830
One, two, three, four. Yes.

64
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:41,170
One, two, three, four, five, six.

65
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:47,050
You all right? You know where to go. One, two, three, four, five.

66
00:08:48,770 --> 00:09:06,400
I want to see how you know what I'm saying.

67
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:19,300
You know, I don't know which one.

68
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:25,270
But I don't know. I don't know for you, sir.

69
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:29,560
Oh, no, no. You're sorry.

70
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:46,460
I can only tell you is that you can see me wondering this.

71
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:49,890
You? Yeah.

72
00:09:50,260 --> 00:10:03,000
I am going to ask you some sheets to get out of here, okay.

73
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:24,870
I got stuck. We don't think they're testing instructions to be over the first name of the people in the group in future who want to talk to you.

74
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:31,490
I think that you do not have to label them with your own name, but just for your own notes, just as you're going through each person.

75
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:37,320
Feel like, sure, your name's got down of there. Don't have to worry about order.

76
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:43,500
Yeah. Yeah. She should be extra somewhere.

77
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:49,980
Anybody got extra sheets? So they're an extra sheet over here.

78
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:55,800
I am worried about. Yes. I don't think that I should have one or two extra.

79
00:10:55,860 --> 00:11:02,280
We have extra to do with you.

80
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:14,620
I have no problem. Well, everybody has their own direction.

81
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:23,520
So they are 832 1130.

82
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:28,050
But I can shoot you triple.

83
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:41,030
Hello. Okay. I'm sorry.

84
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:44,570
I am Anna.

85
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:55,770
Just a couple of minutes into this and everybody sort of settled in shared names.

86
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:05,960
I not ready to get going. How are you? Okay.

87
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:14,610
Yes. I'm Sam.

88
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:20,320
Yeah. Oh, okay.

89
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,900
And and and and so we we don't score.

90
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:30,220
You're not score yourself. Right, right.

91
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:34,570
Maybe I'm just I'm not into. That's why that's so important.

92
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:44,440
I understand. I mean, there is I don't like dark training, but I'm not going to do is not going to do this.

93
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:48,490
I have not done training. I did not do it.

94
00:12:51,420 --> 00:13:24,030
I know I do research on own just once to get myself into the person that I was account.

95
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:31,600
I was like, all right, everybody basically know their names.

96
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:36,610
Okay. Think somebody to go first.

97
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:41,020
Younger person. There is no great advantage to going first or last.

98
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:45,340
This is not that formal. Don't stress about it, you know.

99
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:50,780
Oh, okay. I still like to read. I think I will be timing.

100
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:55,690
Remember, you got to get this done in 60 seconds and everything.

101
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:59,020
So I'm really not ready to get going.

102
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:05,080
Nobody's going first reading this. All right, what I'm gonna do is I'm going to count down.

103
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:11,229
I'm also going to give you, like, a 32nd mark, 15 second mark, five second mark.

104
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:16,660
And then when you're done before the group, do a quick rating.

105
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:23,080
Don't have to do anything more than that. Make sure you know who's going to second rotate through these relatively quickly.

106
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:29,190
Then everybody ready? Seeing the argument.

107
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:35,040
Okay. Three, two, one, go.

108
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,710
This is a true story for 2020 is the pandemic.

109
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:50,390
My grandparents beaches, like basements based around the intensive care unit, were getting ready to do the work.

110
00:14:50,420 --> 00:15:05,420
We heard so many great results in an area where you have to wonder if there was some providers, you were doing whatever they were hurting.

111
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:14,370
So I came back with all sorts of reasons for considered.

112
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:19,849
The dogs come inside now. So as we all know,

113
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:47,160
something for the average Broughton High or really know is that there is a risk that your notes not to take any notes on is just downgraded.

114
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:55,990
You can put your money. Yeah, I'm going to go in next.

115
00:15:56,270 --> 00:16:02,570
Roughly, the judge says we're going to do everything right.

116
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:06,800
You ready for next round? Okay. All right. All right.

117
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:14,870
Everybody ready? Second person. Three, two, one, go.

118
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:41,180
It's a pleasure to talk to you. About $120,000 and counting the number of information about the United States without prejudice.

119
00:16:41,970 --> 00:17:07,900
United States, your early voting, something that I can find here that was later that you might imagine that leads to more challenging, more basics.

120
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:12,430
This fall. This will be the case by now.

121
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:24,820
You know, I'm not I'm not finished yet.

122
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:42,520
So the things that I know you're going through, you know.

123
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:47,050
Oh, right. I'm going. Ready.

124
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:53,710
Three, two, one, go. You know what my problem is?

125
00:17:56,230 --> 00:18:14,360
This existence requires a lot of social interaction.

126
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:25,810
I'll believe it. I just thought it would be over there.

127
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:42,730
I want to make sure this time of night is very simple.

128
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:48,940
You know, the eyes are great.

129
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:53,680
Oh, my God. All right.

130
00:18:56,620 --> 00:19:01,749
That's the third round. Great job.

131
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:05,290
Here. Go next.

132
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:11,670
All right. You ready for the next round and.

133
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:17,200
All right. Fourth round.

134
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:24,940
Three, two, one, go. I feel like I'm already in Michigan for two main reasons.

135
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:29,620
The first cases have been on the rise over the last decade with a significant increase in second.

136
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:40,450
It is treatable and as much as 4000 in 2014 really know about the rules, about giving our public adequate definition, which is much easier.

137
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:52,090
The treatment is working and I think is it is so low has not been able to tell the public it was later.

138
00:19:53,980 --> 00:20:08,890
So while the prevalence isn't perfect, it is decreasing and we are sort of approaching it our based on our recent risk or otherwise,

139
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:39,520
as much as what we've seen now is that people getting ready for the next one.

140
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:48,470
So that's not true. All right, now, ready?

141
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:55,300
Okay, three, two, one, go.

142
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:05,760
Lyme disease is spectrum isn't really transmitted,

143
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:21,710
was kind of like untreated and has fallen by 70% long until the total number of cases has doubled from 2010 and again in 2014 2020.

144
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:29,350
The good news is, is that lives and even more proactive measures taken by public health agency is maintaining

145
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:51,180
a zone on the table promoting the spread of the disease by the simple reason why.

146
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:55,180
All of three. Why.

147
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:15,720
And so I was like, Oh, yeah.

148
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:22,360
All right, ready for the next round?

149
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:28,800
And then we'll heads going. Okay, we're ready. All right.

150
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:41,010
Three, two, one, go. And the last time she went a date with your friends or someone warming your face.

151
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:52,910
Why do you see an animal who most people not thinking about?

152
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:53,330
Take a look.

153
00:22:53,340 --> 00:23:11,050
Stanzel has told you about these cases in many races across particularly my parents expertise, disease, something similar to what is 16 year old.

154
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:20,840
Imagine if you thought you actually did not see Lyme disease by educating people on change.

155
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:25,410
That must be a priority to ensure that we can keep enjoying the great powers that make mistakes.

156
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:32,190
Because by law, we really want.

157
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:40,680
All right. Some works are done. Hundreds have wandered around to go.

158
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:45,990
If you're done, whatever process you want and come up with the totals.

159
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:52,590
So add up the scores for people that just passed the streets around.

160
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:56,100
Read them off. I don't really care. Just eventually work towards getting a total.

161
00:23:56,430 --> 00:24:00,300
All right. So we got one more round to do. That person ready to go?

162
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:08,080
Ready to work in the bar.

163
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:19,350
Just let me in my country now, Michigan, for a little bit of difference.

164
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:22,970
That would happen in the winter. Come see you do that. Wondering why we deliver.

165
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:28,799
That is why we all love dogs. So I like dogs in the hopes of having a dog.

166
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:43,260
One day you might be wondering why and reading to go and I will show you why by hiring as a scout to be taken too many things for nothing.

167
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:52,890
This is one of those things that I don't know.

168
00:24:53,100 --> 00:25:14,400
I mean, I do think that because it is so passionate about five or one year over year.

169
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:22,850
Yeah, right there they kind of start adding up that.

170
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:34,470
I know who's got the highest total score. I don't think I was going to get one number.

171
00:25:40,740 --> 00:26:01,630
So I, I might have started there that I thought that I just felt like, I don't know, I think if I was scored 30.

172
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:12,630
But I think, you know, because I feel like I think the city of Miami right now just, you know, feels like it's good.

173
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:17,480
So I'm doing okay.

174
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:27,300
Make it was like someone did you did you have to get here?

175
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:41,430
And I was like, you know, so I think that's great.

176
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:45,240
I just feel better.

177
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:52,020
I guess. I think we're the winner with nine last time or.

178
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:57,660
Oh, yeah, that's great.

179
00:26:57,670 --> 00:27:02,710
And and then I stopped.

180
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:09,180
It was like, this is like narrative in my life.

181
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,690
So I'm not like here.

182
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:21,780
I didn't know how know, you know.

183
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:35,240
That just doesn't make any sense at all.

184
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:42,140
I don't know about other people. Oh, is that you?

185
00:27:42,620 --> 00:28:04,520
I think we just keep using your beautiful fountain for the third time this year.

186
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:14,980
So you're not going to get my life story?

187
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:28,480
Oh, because I feel like I'm all right.

188
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:36,740
Yes, that's exactly what they're talking about.

189
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:41,780
I don't know why that might be.

190
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:50,330
Okay. He didn't have to tell you something.

191
00:28:54,110 --> 00:29:02,330
I mean, I love him.

192
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:16,730
And I think that's really you're going to be interesting numbers, whatever you want.

193
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:27,930
I know what I'm going to do not know.

194
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:41,760
I was going to ask you because it's a bit more complicated because it's like underneath the building and like.

195
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:51,240
I don't know. Yeah. Oh, no, I don't know.

196
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:58,410
I'll just go almost like where we've hit.

197
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:02,200
Like. Like I was like.

198
00:30:03,290 --> 00:30:14,119
Oh, I started writing it with her. I was like, no, you know, those people.

199
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:43,520
But I knew that I was going to be trying to do it right now.

200
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:47,070
That so cool.

201
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:59,920
So you're doing this for people.

202
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:05,470
Don't just to do this thing.

203
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:10,040
Just ready?

204
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:17,180
That's right. I was at the gas station speaking about someone.

205
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:24,680
All right, let's go. Easy as promised.

206
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:39,530
Coming up. What we have here is far as a shark fin burger, 62%, semi-sweet dark chocolate profitable, which I always bring for this class.

207
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:48,580
So I'm going to go around and I make no claims as to what the winner of each group chooses to do with their chocolate that you got to find with you.

208
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:54,680
Keep it there. I don't care. So look over here.

209
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:59,870
Who is the winner? By a very close margin.

210
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:04,100
Yeah. And you are so, so hot chocolate.

211
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:14,240
But I'd really rather work my way over here.

212
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:27,400
You know, Amy. In the front seat, Aaron.

213
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:33,500
All right. Well, ya.

214
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:44,740
I'm if you had an idea. And here we go.

215
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:52,099
So we're going to talk.

216
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:55,170
Come back to these in a bit. Most of this, again,

217
00:32:55,180 --> 00:33:01,610
the purpose of this exercise is not whether you've got right or wrong to get us to think about the different ways in which we make arguments.

218
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:10,480
The constraints of persuasive approaches that you can use different types of data that you choose to use or not use when making a persuasive argument.

219
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:15,040
What I want to do right now is to think about other messages that we've seen.

220
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:19,420
So just talk out loud, by the way. Don't move.

221
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:24,399
We'll do more stuff in groups that don't like, rearrange itself. But I will be showing something up here in a little bit.

222
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:31,540
So if you have to turn around the result of the public service announcements like this versus things

223
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:40,660
in the media environment of the public service of an ad that is not actually selling a product,

224
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:48,970
but selling an idea of health or exercise or cancer screenings or whatever.

225
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:52,149
So think about let's share,

226
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:59,500
just shout out examples of the raise your hand our find examples of public servant health focused public service announcements that you've seen.

227
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:04,690
What kinds of stuff is put into the media environment about public health?

228
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:12,190
Yeah, there was the big truth initiative about smoking, at least in the media.

229
00:34:12,490 --> 00:34:19,060
Yeah. So there's this whole, you know, I mean, you're not selling cigarets in quite the afternoon selling,

230
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:23,560
quitting, cigarets selling the idea that tobacco is dangerous.

231
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:31,090
The idea that there is, you know, companies are persuading us or distorting us through marketing of tobacco.

232
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:35,830
Absolutely. That's one big one. What else? So when you spend a lot of time around pools drowning.

233
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:37,050
Yeah. Yeah.

234
00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:46,720
So we see I've seen public service announcements, video and otherwise about, you know, school safety, keeping kids out of pools, things like that.

235
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:50,650
What else? Yeah. Interesting. That one particular ticket.

236
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:54,430
Yeah, absolutely. Driving safety? Yes. What else?

237
00:34:55,030 --> 00:35:00,090
Yeah, we got ones in California about, like, being prepared to evacuate, which is adjacent.

238
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:03,220
Help adjacent. We had a few things.

239
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:06,490
Actually, if you think about disaster preparedness.

240
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:10,710
So there's a whole set of public service announcements about disaster preparedness.

241
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:15,490
There's a general stuff sort of like have a plan, you know, how to evacuate from your house,

242
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:17,920
those kinds of I've seen public service announcements about that.

243
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:24,430
And then there are more regional ones, whether we're talking about earthquake safety, whether we're talking about hurricane safety, things like that.

244
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:31,180
What other topics do we see in the public service announcements face? Yeah, like I'm driving like friends.

245
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:35,850
Yeah. Lots of drunk driving lines. And notice that they're different.

246
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:40,540
Kind of like. So there's the drunk driving, one's up, you aren't safe to drive.

247
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:48,100
And there's the drunk driving ones that are about Don't let your friend drive drunk, etc.

248
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:51,760
What else? Yeah. I'm starting to see a lot with marijuana.

249
00:35:51,760 --> 00:36:00,200
I'm keeping edibles away from children. Oh, yes. I was just driving along a road recently and I saw really, I think.

250
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:06,859
Nice. Billboard that was on that topic about you know, and I think if I remember right,

251
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:12,270
it had these pictures of gummy bears and you're like, you know, they don't know what that is.

252
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:16,520
Basically, the message was they don't know what's in these with the implied message of, look,

253
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:21,200
you better lock these up because the kid's going to look at this and they get the gummy bear and you're going to know, is marijuana edible?

254
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,450
What else? Yeah.

255
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:34,960
Physical materials like this, you see, is the more you burn, the more you learn things like 60, 40, 60.

256
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:41,300
What else? Gun safety and locking up ammunition as well as firearms.

257
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:45,320
You. What else comes to mind?

258
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:50,510
Yeah, I've seen some around, like how to do CPR if you're in a situation like that.

259
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:56,150
Interesting. That's an unusual type of public service announcement because it's a much more directive

260
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:02,000
like you have this skill type of thing as opposed to pay attention to this topic.

261
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:07,720
Like most of the things that we've been talking about thus far, I've been paying attention to this topic, attention to gun safety,

262
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:15,500
pay attention to hurricane, attention to driving, drunk, etc. Whereas learn CPR is a very specific behavior.

263
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:19,980
There are other specific behaviors that we've seen in public service announcements.

264
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:27,630
Yeah, I know this sounds like the billboards that are like four casinos and then they say have a gambling problem call or whatever.

265
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:37,590
Oh, that's an interesting one, isn't it? Like we know that those are mandated legally by because the casinos have to pay for

266
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:41,010
it as part of trying to essentially mitigate the public health cost of gambling.

267
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:45,000
There's some public service announcements we ought to be.

268
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:58,350
Skeptical of whether those messages are optimally designed to minimize people gambling, given their funding source.

269
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:05,410
And by the way, we have similar kinds of questions about anti-tobacco campaigns that are funded by the tobacco industry.

270
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:12,070
You can think of a number of different public service announcements that on the surface purport to be about supporting health,

271
00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:17,920
but for which we might raise questions about whether they were designed to be optimally persuasive,

272
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,820
optimally memorable, given what the source that they're coming from.

273
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:27,229
Other thing. Yeah. Is that the same thing for a lot of alcohol?

274
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:30,560
Commercials say please drink responsibly. Is it the same idea for that?

275
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:38,480
Absolutely. You know, the not that this is a public service announcement,

276
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:42,140
but there's a theme that we're going to have to get into here is that there's a distinction between,

277
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,700
as we talked about in the first class,

278
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:50,510
providing information and providing in a way that's likely to be most influential, most informative, most persuasive.

279
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:59,210
Think about drug ads and the way they talk about side effects. You might have like, I don't care.

280
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:07,700
I'm just looking at the happy person running through the field. But this is I mean, part of what I want us to be thinking about here is.

281
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:13,110
Obviously we're bombarded by messages in the context of selling products.

282
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:15,480
Some of those products have to do with health.

283
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:27,840
But really, I mean, the public health community, the medical community are just as much part of the communicators in this space as anybody else's.

284
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:36,839
But there are still Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, but as acts for purpose,

285
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:42,570
it's by the way, it's interesting to me that none of you have mentioned anything.

286
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:53,790
Thus far about how often, not how many public service announcements we've seen in the last year years about this.

287
00:39:55,290 --> 00:40:08,159
About mask wearing, about vaccination, about distance and about, you know, some of these funded by the companies who who put out the vaccine.

288
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:14,580
But most of them not. Most of them funded by government agencies to support specific behaviors.

289
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:21,120
We see vaccination, by the way. We also see public health service announcements about influenza vaccination.

290
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:29,610
Again, a specific behavior, but one that has broader public health implications.

291
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:40,610
I want us to note, though, is. Think about what is not in the media landscape around public health.

292
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:47,270
Most of the things we've talked about are sort of more emotional.

293
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:57,629
Not all of them, but many of them are sort of emotional. So we've got the disasters, we've got the drunk driving and the crashes, we've got marijuana.

294
00:40:57,630 --> 00:41:00,750
And underneath that might be imagining, you know,

295
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:07,500
a kid getting poisoning because they unintentionally consumed marijuana edibles or something like that.

296
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:12,450
We don't see a lot of public health messages around.

297
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:23,960
Eating your broccoli. See if I sicko is actually an interesting exception to that like basic physical activity in that marketing.

298
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:33,760
But even there, it's focused on kids, not on adults. We don't see a lot of messaging around.

299
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:45,239
Obesity. You don't see a lot of messaging around many of the things which are responsible

300
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:49,470
for a substantial amount of the mortality that exists within our society.

301
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:59,580
And in fact, even if we look at things like cancer, what do we see ads for related to cancer?

302
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:07,120
Specifically. Firms.

303
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:11,560
Mammograms, breast cancer, breast cancer.

304
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:16,440
What color is breast cancer? Everybody knows the answer.

305
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:26,889
Let me just pause for a second and think about that. We have a color association with a cancer screening test that was intentionally created.

306
00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:31,719
And by the way, all of you are right now thinking about exactly what color that pink is.

307
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:36,010
It's not hot, fuchsia, you know what color it is.

308
00:42:36,970 --> 00:42:47,560
That association was built a long time ago and very intentionally so that if you ever if you see a ribbon shaped thing in that color,

309
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:54,140
you know what it means. So.

310
00:42:55,330 --> 00:43:00,790
Again, part of this is just about getting us to pay attention to the features of messages.

311
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:06,070
What do we see? What do we not see? How much time gets spent on these different types of things?

312
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:13,330
All right. I want to show us a few all of this on the service announcements.

313
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:16,750
Just want you to react to them, see what you think of them.

314
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:27,310
I do not in any way claim that this is the best, highest quality public service announcements we will ever see rip apart.

315
00:43:27,790 --> 00:43:45,820
But. Sure your mother said you found your closet.

316
00:43:47,050 --> 00:43:51,520
I don't know what I guy was once the one. Sometimes I could get into it.

317
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:55,810
I had to be tortured to do this stuff.

318
00:43:57,070 --> 00:44:00,670
You are right. I learned it by watching you.

319
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:12,850
Parents who use drugs and children who use drugs for their actions.

320
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:19,130
Persuasive. Well, first of all, let's ask this. Who is this tour?

321
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:25,320
Who is the audience for this? Aaron. This is not James.

322
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:32,020
Do you think it is persuasive? Two parents.

323
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:37,620
It's compelling for a parent. I'm not arguing.

324
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:43,229
I'm just as a parent, I don't want to feel fault for something.

325
00:44:43,230 --> 00:44:45,290
It's like detrimental for your kid.

326
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:51,750
And so if this is going to make you feel like you're the reason that they're a failure because they did drugs then.

327
00:44:52,170 --> 00:44:59,580
So it's tapping into an identity here, the parental sense of responsibility for their actions of their kid, the sense of being a good parent.

328
00:44:59,970 --> 00:45:06,630
And they're building an association that says, look, if you use drugs, you may unintentionally what not.

329
00:45:07,170 --> 00:45:13,440
Nobody is arguing here in this that the parent is doing this intentionally. You may be unintentionally doing something that violates that identity.

330
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:20,100
I don't think we can argue about whether it's actually effective at changing behavior.

331
00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:28,430
Is it memorable? If it is or is not.

332
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:32,740
Why? Let's see a few heads nod.

333
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:34,650
Why are you surprised? Why not? Yeah.

334
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:45,900
And I found it memorable because it surprised me like it started out, and I expected that it was going to be about teens doing bad things.

335
00:45:46,350 --> 00:45:50,190
And it changed at the last moment. Yeah. Being about the.

336
00:45:50,770 --> 00:45:55,500
Yeah. So there's that surprise element that helps us hold on to it.

337
00:45:55,530 --> 00:46:03,260
Yeah. I would say that considering it's in the eighties, it's probably more effective than it would be now.

338
00:46:03,290 --> 00:46:06,980
It's clearly dated and we're all looking at it through that lens.

339
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:13,940
And part of the let's be honest, humor value of it is looking at it and going, wow, look at that hair.

340
00:46:14,030 --> 00:46:17,300
Like, really? That's what they do. It's okay. That's fine.

341
00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:24,050
I will also note, I mean, let's when we want to critique these things, let's get really specific about it.

342
00:46:24,770 --> 00:46:30,050
I got pissed at the parent even before we get to the end in terms of the way they're talking to the kid.

343
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:40,540
So that's another thing that's being brought up here, both from a messaging standpoint, but also from a memorability standpoint that I.

344
00:46:40,850 --> 00:46:48,850
And by the way, I remember this one. I saw this one when it came out as I'm that old and.

345
00:46:50,630 --> 00:46:57,680
It's memorable precisely because it triggers these emotions that sort of thought about surprise, etc.

346
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:03,920
Okay. I'm not going here about is this aligning well with behavior change theory?

347
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:09,340
Is this going to be something that's going to like actually predominantly motivate the parent to change their behavior?

348
00:47:09,730 --> 00:47:16,720
I'm stepping aside from that from the moment. I'm just looking at this from the standpoint of is this going to be something you will pay attention to?

349
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:21,040
Is this something you will remember? A day later.

350
00:47:21,850 --> 00:47:28,750
Can I show you another one? I got four of these. I just again, these are all just classic old public service announcements.

351
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:38,560
And I had to show this one because this. Is there anyone out there who still isn't clear about what doing drugs does?

352
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:46,000
Okay. Last time. This is your brain.

353
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:55,750
This is drugs. This is your brain on drugs.

354
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:09,120
And of course, this. Lectures, things and people laughing.

355
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:15,260
Why? Yeah. It reminded me of something in the first grade.

356
00:48:15,870 --> 00:48:23,750
My teacher was like, This is going to happen this year if you drink a beer about fixing it.

357
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:31,110
Remember that? Yeah. Yeah.

358
00:48:31,470 --> 00:48:34,890
I think it's interesting because in that situation, the egg is no longer useful.

359
00:48:34,890 --> 00:48:46,500
But in this one, like, yeah, that's what you do with an egg. So I think that this ad really just misses the mark because you making the egg matter.

360
00:48:49,450 --> 00:48:58,560
It's not like part of what's conflicting here is this sense of we may be talking about drugs, but I'm hungry.

361
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:04,230
Like if the visual images are representing multiple things, there is.

362
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:07,860
Here is an egg we're looking at. I might want to eat that. Yeah.

363
00:49:09,210 --> 00:49:13,410
To the extent that I'm holding on to the metaphorical analogy of my brain is drugs.

364
00:49:13,410 --> 00:49:20,340
Do I want to be a zombie and eating my brains? No. So we're caught in that metaphorical tension.

365
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:27,480
How much am I actually being persuaded by this argument of This is my brain, this is my brain on drugs, etc.?

366
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:30,470
So I'm going to work my way across because I've got hands there any first.

367
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:33,990
I think you sort of still run into that issue, though, where the metaphor is lost.

368
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:39,420
I think like that demonstration with the Coke makes a lot more sense because you're talking about like there's die, there's as if it's breaking down.

369
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:43,910
That's what it's going to do to my teeth or whatever. But when you're here, I'm not buying.

370
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:49,530
That's my brain. I'm definitely not buying that my brain on drugs. I'm like, I'm lost in like, this is funny.

371
00:49:49,530 --> 00:49:54,360
You're making it more useful or whatever. But I've totally abandoned the idea that this is my brain.

372
00:49:54,980 --> 00:50:00,710
All right. In your opinion, was this perceived was this advocacy perceived different?

373
00:50:01,170 --> 00:50:09,090
You know, back in the day when the connotations around drugs were also very different than they are now, and also like range of drugs,

374
00:50:09,090 --> 00:50:15,440
you could talk about marijuana, you know, like those side effects long term, short term might be different than doing like coke.

375
00:50:15,450 --> 00:50:18,390
And so, like, there's this whole range of things, so.

376
00:50:19,470 --> 00:50:24,810
Part of me thinks that this might definitely was more effective when drugs just weren't, you know, a huge thing.

377
00:50:25,110 --> 00:50:28,170
Like it wasn't as common as it is today. So, like, saying something like.

378
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:33,410
Like, I mean, I mean, as. As openly and openly, openly congruent as it is.

379
00:50:33,450 --> 00:50:38,370
Like, you can like you can go to a dispensary, you can buy a drug that back in this day was considered illegal.

380
00:50:38,370 --> 00:50:40,170
So, like, obviously, there's difference.

381
00:50:40,650 --> 00:50:49,260
But, you know, I would think that looking at this like this egg being fried did for when drugs were still a little bit like.

382
00:50:49,950 --> 00:50:53,160
So I'm going to agree, but I'm going to put a slightly different spin on it.

383
00:50:53,170 --> 00:50:57,180
Like I do think it was fundamentally differently seen at that time versus now.

384
00:50:57,180 --> 00:51:04,379
Part of it is the binary of drugs was an unequivocal so at least from a societal norm standpoint, negative thing.

385
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:11,220
At that point in time when marijuana was fully illegal, there was a lot about drug war occurring in the 1980s, etc.

386
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:17,720
On the other hand, the other lens to look at this is we are all like when I put that up.

387
00:51:17,810 --> 00:51:21,500
Most of us already knew where this was going. Like brain on drugs.

388
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:30,440
We've heard this before. It's a meme. The very first time somebody saw this, having never seen or heard this idea before,

389
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:34,160
is a very different experience than way we are experiencing it back.

390
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:44,260
So the surprise element, the what my brain is like, that the novelty is going to make this scene differently.

391
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:51,579
And that's a key thing to take away from any messages like how something looks and feels the first time we see it,

392
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:55,300
when we've never seen it or heard it before. It is fundamentally different than the 40th time.

393
00:51:56,770 --> 00:52:05,170
Now somebody else had to go. I'm just going to say that I think his, like, really authoritarian tone is, like, not persuasive.

394
00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:11,230
It's like, very stigmatizing. And I think, like, the audience you're targeting.

395
00:52:11,410 --> 00:52:16,629
Like, when you have, like, that kind of like tone, it's not somebody who's, like, already experiencing drugs.

396
00:52:16,630 --> 00:52:21,490
It's like you're already, like, alienating that population. So I'm just going to reflect back here.

397
00:52:21,490 --> 00:52:28,330
A question that you're raising is who do we want to listen to the context of this topic?

398
00:52:29,290 --> 00:52:37,050
Reframing this speaker as one who is being called paternalistic, sort of moralizing in the way in which they're presenting.

399
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:41,990
You're clearly an actor, but there's no authority associated with them.

400
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:49,959
They're just somebody on this air. We can think of many alternate people who could be the source of information, including,

401
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:54,760
for example, people who might have experienced drugs, had used drugs before, etc.

402
00:52:55,030 --> 00:53:00,880
Being a different source of information is a question we're going to come back to repeatedly in this course.

403
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:04,060
How do we look at information coming from different sources?

404
00:53:04,930 --> 00:53:12,759
So regardless of how you see this and this is an important question, note that it's important to ask how does the audience see it?

405
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:16,000
And different audiences might see the same person differently.

406
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:22,750
It's always important to ask, is this going to be somebody who I think of as I want to listen to on a given topic?

407
00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:28,750
That doesn't mean that they I might want to listen to them on one topic and not on another, because this could be very specific and funny.

408
00:53:28,910 --> 00:53:35,770
Yeah. So as a child of the eighties, we got a lot of messages that drugs are bad and spent a lot of time and dear.

409
00:53:35,770 --> 00:53:37,300
Drug abuse, resistance, education.

410
00:53:37,370 --> 00:53:44,079
Yeah, I think that this commercial is actually effective for me because I may not have really understood completely what you were saying with the ad,

411
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:47,410
but I still got the drugs or it was just another reinforcement of that.

412
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:52,270
And that's a key point I want to make here. Like, there's no apologies.

413
00:53:55,460 --> 00:54:04,370
There's. What we a nuanced public health audience find when we.

414
00:54:05,590 --> 00:54:08,620
Break it apart into its all components, all of these different components.

415
00:54:08,950 --> 00:54:18,069
And there's the simple, larger takeaway message of drugs are bad that may in fact be memorable and may in fact be influential,

416
00:54:18,070 --> 00:54:23,110
at least at that surface level. Not every message has to be complicated at all.

417
00:54:23,110 --> 00:54:26,380
BE If somebody takes away from this is any drugs are bad.

418
00:54:27,850 --> 00:54:34,720
And I think there's a lot of public health messages that are basically at that level, like driving without a seatbelt is bad.

419
00:54:35,050 --> 00:54:38,830
We're not going to get into the details of crashes in back like we're done.

420
00:54:39,590 --> 00:54:45,460
Yes, if you like. It can also be taken very wrong in this situation.

421
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:52,660
I know like my brother's like I don't know exactly when they played this ad, but when my brother was five years old,

422
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:56,920
he'd see this commercial and be like, Oh my God, I want my brain to be a scrambled egg.

423
00:54:57,610 --> 00:55:02,980
So, like, I feel like it doesn't fully portray the metaphor for fear has its strengths and its weaknesses.

424
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:09,460
And we're going to talk about metaphors in this course. And then we have to talk about is when do they work well and when do they not?

425
00:55:09,850 --> 00:55:20,230
All right. I got two more I want to do quickly. I'm want to move on. Lindsay.

426
00:55:27,850 --> 00:55:33,280
I wish you didn't smoke weed. You're not the same when you smoke.

427
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:39,210
And I miss my friends. I'll be outside the.

428
00:55:47,750 --> 00:55:50,790
All right. Quick thoughts on this one. Yeah.

429
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:56,700
I what strikes me is like the biggest difference is it's not playing into the stigma and the stereotypes as

430
00:55:56,700 --> 00:56:02,909
much where it's like we're not automatically assuming someone is a bad person for doing drugs and in fact,

431
00:56:02,910 --> 00:56:07,200
we're trying to draw on strengths instead. Was this targeted to.

432
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:20,390
So you think more specific individuals using email or do you actually believe that the target is the people who are currently using marijuana?

433
00:56:20,450 --> 00:56:24,560
It's their friends. Their friends. Notice that sentence at the end.

434
00:56:24,830 --> 00:56:28,489
How would you tell a friend that sentence is speaking?

435
00:56:28,490 --> 00:56:32,690
Not to the person who has used it is the person who is the friend of the person who is using.

436
00:56:35,060 --> 00:56:42,380
I guess I'm wondering how effective this is because usually people who smoke weed hang with people who smoke weed.

437
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:49,280
So. So we could ask the question here, is this are there?

438
00:56:51,030 --> 00:56:54,480
Is this going to land on an audience that is going to be responsive to it?

439
00:56:55,620 --> 00:57:03,000
So we have a fit between zero and five on Thursday. Do we have a fit between the audience and the message that this is providing?

440
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:05,780
That's a fair question. Yeah.

441
00:57:05,970 --> 00:57:12,570
I also feel like there's some tension between the shock factor of the dog where like the not with the surprise factor reference point,

442
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:16,680
but then also like it being kind of absurd and so to take it seriously.

443
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:24,060
QUESTION So we can go through lots of these things. Like these are all the kinds of questions we need to be asking about how our messages are landed.

444
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:27,650
Sometimes weirdness is good. Makes us pay attention.

445
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:34,260
Sometimes weirdness is just weird. And you got to we got to wrestle with that because there's one more I want to get and I'm moving

446
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:41,220
fast because there's something I want to make sure we have time for the last part of this class. And yet within several weeks, the earth.

447
00:58:05,570 --> 00:58:13,890
Seems. What?

448
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:24,450
Right just the last 2 hours, like compared to the first the first one,

449
00:58:24,450 --> 00:58:32,519
at least there's some like specificity that they've like picked a drug and they've picked the side effects to target instead of just drugs are bad.

450
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:37,349
And so that's why that's a little bit more compelling. Okay. What else do you know about this?

451
00:58:37,350 --> 00:58:41,040
Right. Well, let me ask you this. Were you paying attention?

452
00:58:44,780 --> 00:58:48,060
Yeah. Why? You're confused.

453
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:51,660
As I was, I didn't know what was going on. I didn't know what was going on.

454
00:58:51,870 --> 00:58:56,190
You were curious. You knew something was going to happen, and we didn't know what it was.

455
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:59,690
So this is not hitting you with the message right up front. This is wait.

456
00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:05,490
Making you wait to find out what's going to go on. And as we'll talk about later in this course,

457
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:13,620
that power of I don't yet know can be very powerful in bringing you in and forcing you to pay attention to a message.

458
00:59:15,330 --> 00:59:24,410
Okay. So again, I feel like the experiential learning, because this is targeted, I'm guessing, towards the actual smoker themselves.

459
00:59:25,380 --> 00:59:33,060
I'm wondering what type of smoker they're targeting, because what if people are functioning smokers that may owe cannabis after they work?

460
00:59:33,060 --> 00:59:36,270
So you may not be solo for a month, if that makes sense.

461
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:40,050
So you're now raising this question of this is showing an experience.

462
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:47,070
If my lived experience doesn't align with that experience, how am I going to take this message?

463
00:59:48,300 --> 00:59:53,940
Is pushing the idea that there may be some consequences of using marijuana?

464
00:59:56,190 --> 00:59:59,999
Whether that lands as being Oh yeah, that's an important thing for me to pay attention to.

465
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,470
Or are you kidding me? And fine is an open question here.

466
01:00:05,820 --> 01:00:09,750
So all of these things, you have one last one, but there's also the. Are you kidding me?

467
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:13,160
I'm fine. But they are actually fine. They just think they are right.

468
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:16,529
Like those drunk driving ads where it's like, no, I'm okay to drive.

469
01:00:16,530 --> 01:00:20,220
And it's like, you really aren't. So I just think that you are.

470
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:25,979
And we could have a fair conversation about if that's what we want to get across.

471
01:00:25,980 --> 01:00:30,600
Is this, in fact doing that cleanly? That would be a fair message for us to get across.

472
01:00:30,810 --> 01:00:32,190
You think you're fine, but you're not.

473
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:39,270
Now then we can look at what was presented there and ask, did that in fact convey that message in a clear and effective way?

474
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:47,370
I'm a tossed. No [INAUDIBLE]. These are just simple name and status for notes.

475
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:52,440
Jot down the names of the people in your group when you get this.

476
01:00:59,470 --> 01:01:12,120
That's when I doubt it was probably short.

477
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:23,650
Changed the group somewhere. You do this because that's the only thing we can do.

478
01:01:24,250 --> 01:01:28,440
I just need another one.

479
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:40,820
Okay. Just shut. Jot down and pronounce your name down.

480
01:01:40,830 --> 01:01:45,180
It's just for you. All right.

481
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:54,330
You got your names started down in space. Okay, so here's your task with no talking.

482
01:01:56,970 --> 01:02:04,980
Write down as many specific details of the speeches that your people in your group gave you.

483
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:13,410
You didn't remember. So no sharing, no topics.

484
01:02:14,250 --> 01:02:17,270
Do this by memory. This was 30 minutes ago, guys.

485
01:02:18,330 --> 01:02:23,160
You were being persuasive. What do you remember?

486
01:02:25,210 --> 01:02:29,470
You're not going to get it all. It's okay. Do it the easy ones first.

487
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:35,980
Don't try and be complete. Don't try and go linearly. Jot down what you can remember as quickly as possible.

488
01:02:40,940 --> 01:02:43,980
Okay. I think that everything. But.

489
01:02:59,140 --> 01:03:02,650
I'm going to give you, like, 2 minutes. Just make quick notes.

490
01:03:02,650 --> 01:03:33,350
You don't have to have everything but jot down what you got. One more minute.

491
01:03:54,520 --> 01:03:59,340
All right. You keep making notes as I go, but let me just read all the stuff about pieces.

492
01:03:59,660 --> 01:04:03,190
This is filler. This is why we're spending today on this course.

493
01:04:03,190 --> 01:04:06,880
This moment. That moment when you went, Oh, [INAUDIBLE]. How do we pay?

494
01:04:08,380 --> 01:04:15,380
That's what today's course is about. This is the challenge of stickiness.

495
01:04:16,620 --> 01:04:23,580
So what I want us to do, shout out, I'm not going to do this in order, but shout out things that really stuck with you.

496
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:27,650
What was the easiest thing for you to remember? As soon as I said Drop down to no.

497
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:32,810
I want to put up as many examples as we can put up on the board in the next 5 minutes.

498
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:39,450
So what is that? What was easy to remember any braided described a story about her grandparents.

499
01:04:39,490 --> 01:04:49,850
That was a story about a grandparent. Good.

500
01:04:50,250 --> 01:04:55,540
Yeah. Crystal made us imagine a tech stuck in your head, and it was bloody and mad.

501
01:05:00,390 --> 01:05:05,220
Right? Yeah. Martin had a really nice catch phrase that zero lime is possible.

502
01:05:06,540 --> 01:05:12,630
Zero. Great.

503
01:05:12,990 --> 01:05:18,120
What else? Yeah. Can I talk about a story about her uncle having one?

504
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:24,120
Because his uncle is good.

505
01:05:24,690 --> 01:05:31,500
Yeah. He had a good example of, like, summer in Michigan and why that's a risk for Lyme disease and discharges to nature.

506
01:05:32,210 --> 01:05:39,200
Right. Good.

507
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:51,890
Yeah. Andrew gave us a fun fact about how car accidents happen more frequently than Lyme disease, and those are in a public health problem, he said.

508
01:05:52,220 --> 01:05:57,410
Yeah. Laura used humor. She compared something to zombies.

509
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:02,510
The number of counties was great. Yeah.

510
01:06:02,870 --> 01:06:09,290
But they also used humor and pretended to be grouchy. And Julia pretended to be Foushee.

511
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:21,170
Julia worried about climate change, which was.

512
01:06:21,170 --> 01:06:30,740
I was angry with that. I wasn't like, I feel good.

513
01:06:30,860 --> 01:06:39,060
What else? And we shared a story about a basketball opponent that she had as a child that got Lyme disease and that stuck with me.

514
01:06:39,990 --> 01:06:45,330
Sorry. There's a story about a basketball opponent that she played basketball with.

515
01:06:54,330 --> 01:07:01,080
Oh, yeah. Uh, yes. Annie had a graph of, like, Lyme disease cases increasing.

516
01:07:01,170 --> 01:07:04,690
So that visual was.

517
01:07:12,730 --> 01:07:16,140
Okay. Yeah, that could talk about fear. Fear?

518
01:07:16,490 --> 01:07:27,020
How? What specifically? Not knowing what's going on. Good.

519
01:07:27,660 --> 01:07:33,110
I'm not scared of dogs and how I feel like I'm. Besides, a lot of people want dogs, but they're vectors for you.

520
01:07:36,210 --> 01:07:41,620
Good. What else? I need to finish with.

521
01:07:41,620 --> 01:07:43,270
When you're in the woods, you're at risk.

522
01:07:51,650 --> 01:08:08,870
We are at risk or at least heard about like a medical student that was all thrown off school in because of Lyme disease.

523
01:08:16,940 --> 01:08:23,450
But. Anymore.

524
01:08:24,530 --> 01:08:28,070
Yeah. Said it ticked off Michigan. Call to action.

525
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:31,640
I get ticked off. Get ticked off. Excellent.

526
01:08:35,630 --> 01:08:39,980
Wow. Good luck. Well, exact same thing.

527
01:08:40,070 --> 01:08:55,810
Okay. Now. If you have started reading the book, which you probably haven't, which is totally fine,

528
01:08:56,620 --> 01:09:01,629
you will quickly run across in the monarch, the Chip and Dan Heath.

529
01:09:01,630 --> 01:09:06,100
You can remember the principles of stickiness and how I got it.

530
01:09:07,150 --> 01:09:25,740
It is this sense of simple, unexpected and free radical emotion.

531
01:09:27,310 --> 01:09:32,049
Sorry, Mubarak. Believe me, you can write it down.

532
01:09:32,050 --> 01:09:36,340
You will see this 47,000 times. You will remember it before the end of this class.

533
01:09:37,180 --> 01:09:41,469
What I am going to do is map what you just told me.

534
01:09:41,470 --> 01:09:51,490
You remembered that arc simple and not as in short, as in one core idea.

535
01:09:52,810 --> 01:09:56,260
Like zero. Lyme disease is possible.

536
01:09:56,470 --> 01:09:59,620
One clean core idea.

537
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:16,090
There's another one I was thinking of that you can't avoid your at risk limelight, theme or unexpectedness.

538
01:10:16,300 --> 01:10:20,140
Surprise, humor. Okay, so we got the song.

539
01:10:21,700 --> 01:10:25,660
We got the Julia. Uh.

540
01:10:27,770 --> 01:10:31,610
Those are probably the two biggest 1041 core idea.

541
01:10:32,090 --> 01:10:38,450
This is in that space to some degree, but it also has a little bit surprise, like a little bit of humor from the get picked off play on words.

542
01:10:38,450 --> 01:10:41,930
So that's good because that's going to tap into just that. All right.

543
01:10:42,590 --> 01:10:52,750
Concreteness. Imagine a tequila on your head and it's bloody heck, you're a whole lot more concrete than that.

544
01:10:58,980 --> 01:11:03,950
The specific specificity of dogs as a possible vector.

545
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:09,420
Like thinking about that, we're not just talking about, oh, you might get a tick planning, but how does having a dog interact with that?

546
01:11:09,420 --> 01:11:17,710
That's also an element of something that's. I don't want to hit on this one.

547
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:26,799
Here. Notice, by the way, that the concreteness is not necessarily measured in numbers, but is it measured in experiential things?

548
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:31,800
Like we have a sense there are a lot of car accidents and that's more than Lyme disease.

549
01:11:31,810 --> 01:11:35,440
This is a little bit fuzzy. How we deal with numbers is a more complicated topic.

550
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:40,340
We'll get into that in this course later on. Credible.

551
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:45,000
This is one you hit multiple times. Let's see. We've got the transparent.

552
01:11:45,510 --> 01:11:50,160
We've got the med student. We've got the basketball opponent.

553
01:11:50,670 --> 01:11:55,190
We've got the full. Not quite sure.

554
01:11:55,190 --> 01:12:00,799
Capturing this one depends upon how it was framed in terms of how who's providing that information.

555
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:05,110
But that's okay. Um. Emotional.

556
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:12,690
But we certainly had the kick in the head emotion and we got fear.

557
01:12:12,850 --> 01:12:20,670
Yeah, that's emotion. If you're a student like you get knocked off, you're off your studies because you've had Lyme disease that's going to kill you.

558
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:27,570
What else comes to mind, depending upon how this one is framed?

559
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:33,470
Could have some emotion here. Stories.

560
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:40,670
Stories accompanies many of these different principles. Stories are often concrete, credible emotion.

561
01:12:40,970 --> 01:12:44,960
And we have let's see one story. True story.

562
01:12:49,610 --> 01:12:54,740
Story. But you see, the graph tells the story. But when you see the graph tells the story.

563
01:12:55,220 --> 01:12:59,000
Well, so this is a question. How the graph was presented.

564
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:07,280
Could tell a story or could not. And I'm being ambiguous here because a lot depends upon is there a story that has been

565
01:13:07,310 --> 01:13:13,129
told for which the graph is representing that information or is it here is information.

566
01:13:13,130 --> 01:13:17,030
What is that process analytically? Numbers are hard.

567
01:13:17,300 --> 01:13:22,660
Going to spend a lot of time in the middle of this course talking about when does when do numbers be persuasive and when not.

568
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:28,490
But notice that even in the context of presenting numbers, what's the characteristic that was presented?

569
01:13:29,150 --> 01:13:33,290
It's going up. It's not. There was a hundred or a thousand.

570
01:13:33,470 --> 01:13:42,770
It's not what the number is, it's the pattern. Which is why most of the context in which we use numbers persuasively are not actually concreteness.

571
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:48,910
They're emotion. When the numbers evoke emotion, that's when they're persuasive.

572
01:13:49,620 --> 01:13:55,330
You know, that's not discourse. That doesn't pass.

573
01:13:55,810 --> 01:13:57,970
I've done this exercise every month.

574
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:06,940
I have never been unable to hit every single one of those principles with what you guys remember actually doing this exercise.

575
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:12,040
This is experiential learning. Remember this moment?

576
01:14:14,940 --> 01:14:18,960
I gave you an exercise where you wanted to be persuasive. There's no instruction.

577
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:24,810
And what did you gravitate toward? What were the things that made the most impact on the peers in your group?

578
01:14:25,290 --> 01:14:30,190
This stuff. We're going to do it. The rest of this course is teach you how to do this.

579
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:38,639
Intentionally the clear and focused way, not just random, that if you happen to use one of these, great.

580
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:44,700
If you didn't, don't worry about it like this is the whole purpose of this is to show the many different

581
01:14:44,700 --> 01:14:49,860
ways in which we approach trying to be persuasive and some of the challenges that we face.

582
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:53,729
Yes. What did you say? 945 is the time frame. Yes, it is.

583
01:14:53,730 --> 01:14:58,670
And thank you for reminding me. So.

584
01:15:14,050 --> 01:15:18,900
What do you want to remember? Yeah.

585
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:26,989
Okay. So thinking about the samples, I guess I was wondering, like, maybe I misunderstood this.

586
01:15:26,990 --> 01:15:34,550
Like, is the audience, I mean, is it the general public or is it because you could be doing any or all of that?

587
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:39,830
But really, the question as to whether or not these approaches are going to make a message memorable.

588
01:15:40,770 --> 01:15:45,110
On the question of fit to the audience, but it doesn't change the power of the audience.

589
01:15:46,550 --> 01:15:50,140
Yeah, I guess I'm just wondering because like the first question I've always gotten,

590
01:15:50,140 --> 01:15:55,250
if I'm like logging into something after telling a story is like, okay, how many people will get to that?

591
01:15:56,060 --> 01:16:06,320
Hold that thought. We'll get to it. Okay. So as we do every class wrap up with this big sticky note, short phrases, couple of words.

592
01:16:06,710 --> 01:16:09,710
What do you want to remember from today?

593
01:16:09,830 --> 01:16:13,880
This can be the principles we're talking about. This could be Julia Foushee.

594
01:16:14,390 --> 01:16:20,660
Yeah, I remember. I remember you don't leave until that thing gets filled.

595
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:33,070
Yeah. For thinking about who is the audience and who's the source of information and who is audience.

596
01:16:34,630 --> 01:16:37,830
Who is the source? Yeah.

597
01:16:39,160 --> 01:16:47,740
How fast the 60 seconds is 60 seconds fast.

598
01:16:49,020 --> 01:17:08,829
The numbers are affected more because of their emotion rather than its unexpectedness.

599
01:17:08,830 --> 01:17:22,030
And humor are really important. I'm sure it just mentioning unexpectedness and humor because we're going to go into these in more detail.

600
01:17:22,030 --> 01:17:26,470
They're not always helpful. Yeah, not every message has to be complicated.

601
01:17:27,100 --> 01:17:42,010
Not every message has to be complicated. But. Yep.

602
01:17:45,870 --> 01:17:49,060
Check yourself for ticks. Don't forget.

603
01:18:00,030 --> 01:18:03,690
Yeah. Stories stick with you. Stories stick with you.

604
01:18:13,050 --> 01:18:16,560
Be intentional. Intentional about what we are naturally drawn to.

605
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:25,440
I'm just going to leave it as being factual, focused on that last night.

606
01:18:25,830 --> 01:18:29,790
Make sure your message is memorable after 30 minutes. I thought that was really interesting.

607
01:18:40,890 --> 01:18:47,550
You happens every time we're going to do this, all with this appearance, thinking about what is it you want to hold on to.

608
01:18:48,240 --> 01:18:50,129
And by the way, this can be totally silly stuff.

609
01:18:50,130 --> 01:18:56,600
Like, I'm serious when I say maybe what you want to remember is Julius about you or anything you might remember.

610
01:18:59,140 --> 01:19:05,790
All right. So this is an experiential that is getting us to realize the challenge that we're facing.

611
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:13,170
You have lots of knowledge. We have lots of information. We can prevent it as persuasive in one sense.

612
01:19:13,660 --> 01:19:16,170
Well, I mean, I guess the question is, one,

613
01:19:16,860 --> 01:19:27,179
sometimes the ones who are not one of them that I want to remember old returns from the current stuff folder

614
01:19:27,180 --> 01:19:35,850
because I do want to talk about audience and role really foundational stuff in communications design on Thursday.

615
01:19:36,390 --> 01:19:42,090
On Tuesday, because I was doing a reading, which is the first chapter and the introduction to the book,

616
01:19:42,090 --> 01:19:49,330
which focuses on simple battle books, says that you want to be memorable if you want to be seen.

617
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:56,610
Two things you need to do. One is simple to everything else.

618
01:19:58,230 --> 01:20:04,680
Yes, this is the logic of being simple is probably the more important.

619
01:20:04,860 --> 01:20:06,810
The most important thing I'm going to talk about in this course,

620
01:20:07,410 --> 01:20:13,170
the little challenge yourself to think about how does this apply to the kinds of messages you want to be a part of?

621
01:20:14,280 --> 01:20:27,270
So that's what we're going to do all Thursday, you and your chocolate gallery.

622
01:20:29,720 --> 01:20:40,380
Yeah, but I thought it was pretty excited today.

623
01:20:43,590 --> 01:20:56,200
So I hear you.

624
01:20:57,150 --> 01:21:05,670
I'd like to say hello to you.

625
01:21:05,880 --> 01:21:15,120
That's me. I want to know how you tend to be.

626
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:22,910
I just started, you know. Did I say you're not listening?

627
01:21:24,060 --> 01:21:30,250
I don't know. I know who you are.

628
01:21:30,780 --> 01:21:55,740
So that's what I want to show you, what I thought was also moving on from one year ago.

629
01:21:56,590 --> 01:22:14,670
I want to thank my friends and my friends and we're going to hear the first half of the comments, I'm sure my friends from college.

630
01:22:15,980 --> 01:22:21,850
Are you going to find out everything going on?

631
01:22:22,770 --> 01:22:33,150
Yeah. I mean, if you're if you're in five, 12, 1230, six, 50, what have I also happen to be in a row?

632
01:22:35,580 --> 01:22:40,750
I made my other three announcements.

633
01:22:41,180 --> 01:22:46,200
When we do not intervene. Oh, you are the other.

634
01:22:46,590 --> 01:22:51,280
Yeah. In the evening or so you get involved.

635
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:56,180
There is an opportunity at 11:00.

636
01:22:58,150 --> 01:23:02,940
Usually Friday afternoons. Okay. Probably for a few reasons.

637
01:23:03,140 --> 01:23:07,220
I don't know. All right. You can email me the email.

638
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:12,640
Just put you on the list. We can go from his office in this building.

639
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:19,480
Oh, that's so I can, like, reunites all of those centers in the labs.

640
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:23,530
And he wasn't sure that next to me.

641
01:23:24,040 --> 01:23:29,619
Yeah, like, obviously sci fi and, like, know it doesn't look like it was available or if it was on here.

642
01:23:29,620 --> 01:23:33,710
But he doesn't think that is his home near his home.

643
01:23:34,510 --> 01:23:42,540
I wonder what building it had, but I think I think I think this is the home base apartment of movie studios,

644
01:23:43,210 --> 01:23:48,970
which is that because he hasn't seen that?

645
01:23:50,460 --> 01:23:53,840
No, not at all. I. Right.

646
01:23:55,280 --> 01:24:00,830
But she said it was three days ago.

647
01:24:00,910 --> 01:24:04,610
It was like, oh, I saw this plane crash.

648
01:24:05,350 --> 01:24:09,130
I remember they're talking about it like this. I'm behind that.

649
01:24:10,240 --> 01:24:15,180
What about like a similar like like number one?

650
01:24:16,300 --> 01:24:23,760
It doesn't make any sense. Like, you want to do things to be trained on the stuff around you.

651
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:27,700
You're probably going to say, Oh, I knew it when I sent it to that.

652
01:24:27,700 --> 01:24:31,870
I, I went to the module when you did it and there's no way.

653
01:24:31,960 --> 01:24:36,850
The other one. Yeah. I mean, talk to your manager.

654
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:40,620
So basically I have no idea what's okay now, but.

655
01:24:40,630 --> 01:24:47,090
85. Yeah, that's. Yeah.

656
01:24:47,110 --> 01:24:51,489
I'm not even I get to everyone's like. Okay.

657
01:24:51,490 --> 01:24:57,879
So if you go back and you're 75, you get through a lot of years and I think it's just all.

658
01:24:57,880 --> 01:24:58,053
But yeah.
