1
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:30,910
Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Nice to see you all again back into the warm room, 11, 20 feet or whatever,

2
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:35,710
and no of things like extreme temperature changes right to come from outdoors,

3
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:45,130
indoors and then like all the condensation inside your mask, of course, and it's like a nasty mess inside or pleasant.

4
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:50,450
Uh, I wanted to start off and actually, we'll probably stare the slide for for a little bit here.

5
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:54,650
And there's there's a lot on there, even though it's only a few bullets.

6
00:00:54,650 --> 00:01:04,970
Uh, I wanted to start with you an intro as we've continued to kind of evolve from, of course, enrollment standpoint today is actually the final drop.

7
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:09,850
And so I think this should be pretty much where we land.

8
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:20,100
But I wanted to invite give me a quick hand raise if this is your first time joining class in person today, if you give me a minute to get settled.

9
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:27,310
I mean, if he had a chance to watch some of the course recordings from the first couple of seconds,

10
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:34,160
each student went around and just did like a quick 60 second kind of self introduction to your name.

11
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:39,970
Uh, what program of study, what year you're in and what, if anything, you know,

12
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:45,150
drew your interest in this class, if you wouldn't mind giving a quick self introduction?

13
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:57,200
Oh, so I feel it. I'm the second year MPH, and what drew you to this course is, I mean, out of interest in terms of policy like I am,

14
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,560
maybe one day if I want to do even more school hoping to do law school.

15
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,040
So policies relevant to that stuff.

16
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:12,700
Thank you so much feeling. All right. So that was bullet number one.

17
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:16,210
Uh, the second one. This is kind of like taking a step back.

18
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:27,640
No, I promised I was going to do this before opening required that, uh, I am definitely feeling it.

19
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:32,440
Just to kind of share a little bit. I want to just ask how people are doing.

20
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:39,760
Does anyone else just feel like it's crazy madness that it's impossible to keep up with life in general?

21
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:45,080
Lots of head nods. OK, thank you. I feel like I'm not alone.

22
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:54,610
Um, do you folks have anything show to share? I mean, I kind of committed to, you know, like our goal is to learn.

23
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:57,310
Right? We want to learn as much as we can in this class.

24
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:04,540
But I also don't want to just blindly overlook barriers to learning right or mean teaching effectively.

25
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:12,580
And so I, you know, prompts periodically, folks on just kind of how they're doing and and sharing anything that you feel comfortable sharing.

26
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:18,030
And to the extent that actually a couple of levels, to the extent that they can help our class, that's great.

27
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:23,320
Um, I also. And please don't take away that like that.

28
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:29,350
I'm like, important in any way. I I have a couple of roles that I serve.

29
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:34,540
One is within my Department of Environmental Health Sciences. I'm the associate chair.

30
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:43,610
And then at the school level, I serve on a on an executive committee, which is basically an advisory committee to the dean, the Dean Bowman.

31
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:49,990
Uh, so I'm a pretty good conduit to kind of feedback to higher levels of what's going on.

32
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:55,120
And it's a pretty common topic or prompt in some of those meetings and a faculty

33
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:02,380
meeting or in this advisory meeting with the dean is to be asked How are things going?

34
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:07,900
You know, how are things in research labs? How are things in classrooms?

35
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:13,210
And so even if it's not something that can specifically be addressed in this class,

36
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:22,940
to the extent that it's information that I can relate to, that's really important people to help in any way.

37
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:31,360
And what what do people what are your biggest barriers right now to being a student?

38
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:38,410
And these in the you're the possible responses can be things that have nothing to do with being a student.

39
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:44,830
If that's not the case, I feel like I'm probably not the only one who is in fact about my semester.

40
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:51,010
Literally, on the first day of classes, I tested positive for COVID and I kind of just threw me off for the rest of my sister,

41
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:58,750
and I feel like a lot of other people have been in and out, and I feel that's kind of been making everything a lot more hectic for everyone.

42
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:05,260
Yeah. Thanks for sharing that, Josh and I, you know, I think you already acknowledged you're not alone in that in that regard.

43
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:11,590
And you know, when we start on the first day of class and say the most important thing we want to have is to to be

44
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:17,320
feel like we are comfortable enough to have in-depth discussions around topics that we know each other,

45
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:25,660
what our backgrounds are and so forth and not being present. Classes is absolutely a barrier right to that whole, that whole concept.

46
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:32,200
I thought Caitlyn, yeah, just blew it off. But I think just kind of the readjustment to like most new year,

47
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:38,980
like half in person when like there's still like obviously people who could not be in person in the nick.

48
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:45,220
So it's just kind of like there's almost this vagueness with all my classes of like, I should be there.

49
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:51,070
But also like if you can't be there, don't be there, but you should, you know, like it's it's weird.

50
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:56,560
Yeah, middle. And I just don't. I just feel like I have like a foot in the door door.

51
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:02,110
Sure, sure. Or you don't know where you stand from from. It's like it changes our day to day basis.

52
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:10,190
I'm always great what you think is your plan for this week. There's a wrench thrown in and suddenly the equation changes.

53
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:17,780
Yeah, I appreciate that. Thank you. Thank you, Caitlin. A quick show of hands for how many people are you?

54
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:22,420
Um, almost entirely in person in your class classes.

55
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:32,230
Anybody who's not anybody who like it's a minority thinks, OK, so this is one of the of few courses that you're gathering in person.

56
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:39,910
Okay. Um, any any other responses or thoughts that folks have got?

57
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:47,380
I think there's a lot of like intentional kind of mindfulness around, like where students and faculty and staff are coming from last term.

58
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:51,370
Like, if you don't have the fast return on your cameras today, totally valid,

59
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:56,050
like all those kind of pieces of like, you know, please do what's best for you and your families.

60
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:57,790
I haven't seen that as much this year.

61
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:03,470
Like, I hear a lot more living classes with professors being like, Yeah, if you can turn off the camera, you turn on a camera, you should.

62
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:10,360
And um, not as much of that mindfulness when it's like the reason I turn off my cameras because I'm a good wife, I aware at home.

63
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,610
Sure, I think is also another barrier. Yeah.

64
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:21,850
So I think kind of for the classes that can happen in-person, continuing the mindset of like, OK, all the same pieces, yet the same.

65
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:26,860
And that's a great point. And just because you're in the classroom doesn't mean that,

66
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:33,460
like you don't have some of the same issues or reasons for why you might turn off your camera in a remote.

67
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:41,770
That's an excellent point. Thank you so much. That is something I can absolutely take back and share with others.

68
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:46,720
Um, along the lines, a little bit of a Segway,

69
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:56,530
but I've gotten some feedback as part of some other discussions about frustration with some of the communication.

70
00:07:56,530 --> 00:08:03,340
Like at a higher level, whether it's at the school level or even at the university level around expectations.

71
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:09,940
And maybe it's a little bit along the lines of what you mentioned, Caitlin, like I should be coming, I shouldn't be going or what?

72
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:14,200
You know, what bar do I hit where it's just that that decision point?

73
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:24,940
And even with masks, this is like a frustratingly but continually evolving and not going away issue, right?

74
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:29,770
It's a whole nother topic to talk about, like federal level mask guidance and communication,

75
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:38,160
which it would be a great focus of discussion in this class. Um, but just just for now at the university level,

76
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:49,460
do folks feel like other experiences you can share or where you see things that conflict with information or messaging?

77
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:57,760
Yeah, I work at the COVID testing center like the 60p program, and we get so many questions every day about COVID protocol.

78
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:05,950
People have no idea what's going on. People come in when they're positive and try to get tested again when we have like no PPE to deal with it.

79
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:09,700
And I feel like we're kind of fielding the questions like for the university.

80
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:15,270
But then the university are telling us that, yeah, so no one knows anything.

81
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:23,200
Okay, so here I am to make a perfect example of your of your, uh, the comment that you made.

82
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:29,950
I'm going to ask you what one of the discussions that I was involved in centered around.

83
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:36,010
I think it's been 95 masks that there was some sort of communication that they're available at some places,

84
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:42,520
including the campus testing locations and people saying, Yeah, I went,

85
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:50,740
I grabbed a bunch I brought into my classroom and sent them over my students and then other people who said, Yeah, I went to me,

86
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:58,360
they didn't have any, you know, and that that was like a source of confusion around, Okay, is that a thing or not?

87
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,070
Do you know more than I do? Yeah.

88
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:09,670
So there's like several distribution sites, but this last shipment that they gave us, the kind of screwed up and give us have like child size.

89
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:14,390
No kidding. And then we found that, yeah, only a little child.

90
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:17,870
Yeah, yeah. Like so we run out pretty fast.

91
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:22,830
We had to like limit the amount that we're allowed. What gives her, okay?

92
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:28,050
Okay, so it's hard of like an instructor is trying to come in and get them for their class.

93
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:33,960
You don't have that right. So I don't know if that was just like an ordering issue or if that's like, I don't know,

94
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:41,250
it's kind of a mess because people are like holding up these like teeny tiny little masks that obviously are not going to be an adult, right?

95
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:44,850
But we'll see what happens with that. Okay, interesting.

96
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:52,320
Thanks for sharing on a very personal note. After class, I have a 3:15 appointment over comments to go forward.

97
00:10:52,320 --> 00:11:01,020
Just a routine, even automatic tests. But I plan to ask whoever is there at the same question Hey, I just came from my class.

98
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:07,380
Any chance I can get some math to make available to students? OK, thank you.

99
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:12,710
Any other comments, like most people, my experience or because how I received the communication,

100
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:18,360
but seems like a very different mindset between fall and now that from the top down in

101
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:23,490
the sense of like there was a big period for about a week or two before classes started,

102
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:27,210
where I think a lot of students don't know where they're going to be in-person.

103
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:36,060
And then the communications from, I think, our former president, the tone of it basically seemed to be kind of Colvin's over deal with it.

104
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:39,330
And like I've kind of seen that went around, it's global.

105
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:45,120
Health is good because public health students, but like whenever I go like the busses or like,

106
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,740
I think the undergrads maybe have gotten that message somewhere there.

107
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:56,990
This is for my experience, but it seems like a very different tone and acceptable risk level than the fall.

108
00:11:56,990 --> 00:12:01,950
So, yeah, yeah. Thanks for sharing that, Josh.

109
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:07,950
And I think, I mean, as a faculty member and colleagues, I can share that, you know, everybody I think,

110
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:14,490
considered the break as almost like a waiting for waiting for some new news to drop, right?

111
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:20,820
Because there were other institutions that didn't hesitate and said, we're going to delay reconvening our semester by three weeks.

112
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:25,510
We're going to go or we're going to start on time, but we're going to go remote indefinitely.

113
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:33,270
Um, and I again, it's a whole nother discussion, but at the national level, I think that's absolutely the case, right?

114
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:40,020
Or it was the interpretation. It was literally days before the holidays.

115
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:53,160
And you know, our our biggest, uh, policy representatives were on national TV saying, yes, it's okay to gather with your family and your friends.

116
00:12:53,160 --> 00:13:00,240
As long as you're vaccinated. You don't need to worry about, you know, masks and enjoy your time together and all these things, right?

117
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:06,360
And it was within a matter of days. It was a complete 180 on that.

118
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:14,170
Um. So in terms so I can I can also take back, though some of that.

119
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:27,710
I agree with you. And take back some of that messaging or input to others kind of as some as some feedback because you're right,

120
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:34,840
you know, you're a public health student. I'm a faculty member based on public health, so it's a little bit of an island.

121
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:40,850
You know, I think across the campus, actually, you mentioned undergrads. We have several undergrads in this class.

122
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:44,950
Do folks want to share like what your kind of perceptions are?

123
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:49,510
The hands are going up as I've tried Victoria, and I'm sorry.

124
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:54,100
Oh, OK. So before we leave that topic, same thing when I was like reading the email.

125
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:54,490
Yeah.

126
00:13:54,490 --> 00:14:05,320
And it's like to me, like the whole vaccine messaging from the government and everything is like ridiculous to me because we know that that is not.

127
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:09,080
Do you want that for us and we need to wear high quality masks and stuff?

128
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:12,700
Yeah. I was also frustrated in the messaging from the school.

129
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:19,090
They were like, No one's getting COVID in the classroom. So I'm like, You can't prove that no is getting COVID in the classroom.

130
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:23,320
So they probably are because you don't have like high quality masks.

131
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:30,920
We're students. We can't buy a nice pass by yourselves. It was like stuff like that has also been frustrating.

132
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:36,700
Thank you for sharing that. Bridget, speak to the undergrads, I guess.

133
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:45,050
Yeah, I'm a senior in the folks in the undergraduate program here, but I was also an R.A. and it's predominantly freshmen during this time of year.

134
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:48,710
So yeah, that's an exceptional perspective to have.

135
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:57,350
It's a good time, isn't it? Especially for one student, I felt like I was gathering playgrounds, but I think that, first of all,

136
00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:02,180
I know there's such a lack of trust in the university kind of administration,

137
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:08,040
and that's valid from our last president being removed in the way he did.

138
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:13,250
And I think even before that, with what we're talking about, the lack of clear messaging, I mean, not to be crass,

139
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:18,620
like I think we've all seen the likes of some kids like messaging across campus, much less space on that.

140
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:24,950
In case you don't know that that was like something that was on bus stops. Yes. Yeah, it's really nice to see, especially the talk as well.

141
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:29,420
So parents are like, what's that like?

142
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:37,040
But um yeah, I think that it's valid and like students are very unclear as to what they're supposed to be doing.

143
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:43,430
There's also all that very deep exhaustion with COVID procedures as much as they try to build community.

144
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:50,150
And then there's this other kind of scary mindset, especially among like healthy young folks that I've seen.

145
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,950
And that's not everyone.

146
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:59,030
Like, COVID is going to become endemic at some point, and I'm young and I'm healthy and omnipresent as far as harsh things like Delta was.

147
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:06,590
So why wouldn't I go out? And that's not everyone. And I don't think undergrad should be lumped into that kind of mindset.

148
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:13,070
But there's like I think those three things culminate together to form something particularly ugly at times,

149
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:19,370
but that's kind of the three major opinion areas I've seen.

150
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:21,260
Thank you so much for sharing that.

151
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:27,900
And I, you know, I told you a little bit about myself and my background and most of that research stuff so I can share some family things.

152
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:35,270
I have this ridiculous context, I guess, that spans different age groups and different experiences.

153
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:40,460
So my Christine and I have four children together.

154
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:49,130
Three of them are undergrad students at different institutions, so I absolutely get the perspective from them, right?

155
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:54,540
And uh, you know, we're healthy. It's really not a big deal.

156
00:16:54,540 --> 00:17:00,350
Okay. I promise not to kill grandma, you know, but, uh, this kind of stuff.

157
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:05,900
But at the same time, our youngest, our fourth, uh, at the start of the pandemic was a fourth grader.

158
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,940
Now is a sixth grader.

159
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:17,380
And up until early December wasn't vaccinated at all right, because he was in that at least the latest age category to become eligible.

160
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:22,740
Right. So we're stressing about, you know, college kids are coming home to visit and like, Yeah, yeah, what happened?

161
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:29,300
Really? Oh my gosh, we have this kid who's, you know, highly vulnerable and has no vaccine.

162
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:39,410
So, yeah, so I'm, you know, when I'm when I'm soliciting comments and sharing experiences, it's not from a single, you know, from a faculty member.

163
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:43,220
And that's all I know. Uh, so thank you.

164
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:46,490
Was there another hand up? Yeah. Yeah. I'm also an undergrad.

165
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:52,190
I think that with the uncertainty in the district of mistrust, that's something that I've definitely heard a lot.

166
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:56,150
The uncertainty of not the school counselor could be different, but I think a lot of classes,

167
00:17:56,150 --> 00:18:00,830
it was important policy around a business minor and then my focus areas, social stuff.

168
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:08,630
So I've seen a lot of different schools and I don't know the protocol is here, but when people are second professors, they don't commit, obviously.

169
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:13,850
But then there's no requirement the person recording anything for classes.

170
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:19,610
So then students who are like, Well, I don't feel like I've heard people in class, but I don't feel that well.

171
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:26,300
But I have already missed like two classes or something like that, and they're not recording and they're not telling me what I'm supposed to do.

172
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:32,600
And there's undergraduate worried about like grades for grad school or grades for jobs and things like that that they're going to right now,

173
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:38,450
especially. I'm also a senior. So I think that that in addition to the semester,

174
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:45,350
just be more difficult because it's in-person and that makes school just harder, I think, at least for me in school and online.

175
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:52,580
And so now I don't know, like all of that together has made students just want to go in person and be like,

176
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:58,550
just screw to that kind of stuff, which is not good, but it puts a lot of the attitudes out here.

177
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:03,870
That's great. Thank you for sharing that. Um, and I agree that's really important, right?

178
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:08,930
Uh, and that's also, you know, some feedback I can I can take back and try to reemphasize, right?

179
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:15,470
And some sort of strong encouragement to instructors to record class.

180
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:24,250
It's super easy, right? You see me hit the record button at the beginning of Class Panopto within canvas that automatically makes it available, right?

181
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:27,650
I have to do very, very little in order to do that.

182
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:29,840
And that's the case for I think for.

183
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:36,320
Much in class, you know, on campus, I have the same frustrations as a parent, I mentioned my three that are in undergrad.

184
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:42,120
They have courses. That's not the case. And, you know, I don't know, my roommates just tested positive.

185
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:47,270
I'm going to get tested should I go to class? Oh, you really shouldn't go to class, but I'm going to fall behind.

186
00:19:47,270 --> 00:20:01,550
I'm going to miss everything, right? It's a disincentive to actually, you know, how people practice healthy behaviors.

187
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:06,860
Thank you for sharing that. Yeah, it's just it was like an offhand comment that you made, but like,

188
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:12,110
I have literally heard someone in class say, Oh, I was exposed to this person over the weekend.

189
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:18,860
I had to go get a test. Yeah, well, yeah, that's the soonest.

190
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:26,180
You can get an appointment, right? Because you know, there's a demand and you can't just get it on demand.

191
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:28,220
Yeah, for sure. Also,

192
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:36,080
with the testing exposure is there's like this weird gray area that I feel at least like where people are getting exposed or them like

193
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:46,370
they're testing negative on an at home test or like positive on the like steps or this like spit test that school does or not getting like,

194
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:53,420
I don't know, I just feel like there's so many mixed messaging on what to test, like trust or not trust timing wise, especially like, I don't know,

195
00:20:53,420 --> 00:21:02,240
like I had friends who like, traveled and then came like, knew they were exposed, then tested negative, like immediately upon returning, like one day.

196
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,350
You know what I mean? So it's kind of like, I don't know. Hard to manage,

197
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:11,240
at least socially to like when I should be concerned or not concerned about an exposure

198
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:14,810
that I've had based on the timing of testing and what kind of tests they took.

199
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:23,770
And like that alone is very like information overload and like, I can't imagine to like, I'm a peer facilitator for your students.

200
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:31,110
So like freshmen, sophomores, lot of housing. And like, I'm imagining they're going through that way, worse living in those situations.

201
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:35,870
So in the end, just a lot of ambiguity that I definitely can like soul.

202
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:42,710
Hey, do you have a comment that's really gonna answer your question that I've worked at the testing site for so long?

203
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:51,650
It's just like so beaten into my brain. But so that's PCR tests at CSDP, and it's only if you're asymptomatic.

204
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:57,530
You can still go if you're exposed as long as you're not like, you know, sore throat, whatever.

205
00:21:57,530 --> 00:22:07,430
So if you test positive on that, like you're still you're like pretty much 100 percent positive if you test negative on an at home test,

206
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:15,660
like some threshold to me, that is so high. But even if you like test negative on it, you can still be positive.

207
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:21,350
It's like on a PCR. But if you test positive on an at home on like your symptomatic were not symptomatic,

208
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:25,100
like you're very contagious, like you should not be around people.

209
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:33,110
So if you're I guess in summary, positive PCR, you're definitely positive negative on a PCR,

210
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:40,790
you're likely definitely negative negative on an at home test out of the home and positive on an at home test.

211
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:46,490
You're like really contagious. So think you know, that makes sense that I'm going to spread that to people because like,

212
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:51,110
that's been part of the thing that I've been seeing is people being like, I was exposed by just taking at home.

213
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:56,850
So it's fine. And like, I've kind of been like, there's no way this is why this whole time.

214
00:22:56,850 --> 00:23:00,950
But now and we get we get that question all the time.

215
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:05,180
And I just that was something that was like message. Yes, better.

216
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:08,090
Yeah, because I feel bad because there's people more like, you know,

217
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:11,420
I have a sore throat, but I took it at home test most negative, some kind of test.

218
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:19,310
So I'm like, Yeah, breathing under this, I got a positive out of that home test and I don't believe it.

219
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:23,210
Can I give a test here like, please leave the building right away? Yeah.

220
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:31,730
And this was this was part of a, uh, mixed messaging or inaccurate messaging right leading into the holidays that there

221
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:36,410
was like this huge reliance on gathering with family and friends and so forth.

222
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:41,900
And if you hate, get an at home test, you know, wait as long as possible to take it.

223
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:45,830
And then if you take it, then great now you can safely get it right.

224
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:55,220
And as was explained there, there truly only certain certain and positive confirmation.

225
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:57,560
For the most part, if you already have symptoms, right?

226
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:07,580
And without symptoms, it's a little bit of an assurance, but it's that short of a, well, sort of a guarantee.

227
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:18,560
Yeah, I think it's uh, so my sixth grader had a full blown fever, sore throat, fatigue, whatever, right?

228
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:26,390
And Christine and I thought, OK, that like we're ninety nine point five percent sure he has, you know, code.

229
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:38,550
It's highly contagious. Whatever he's in person school. And we had a PCR tested when he's highly symptomatic and he's negative.

230
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:40,320
And he had the flu. Right?

231
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:49,950
So in this case, you know, perhaps an at home test would help to differentiate whether you're ill with it with another type of virus instead of COVID.

232
00:24:49,950 --> 00:25:00,740
But I think that's the exception right now. With that, with that instance was.

233
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:03,470
Any other thoughts or our comments?

234
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:15,110
I also wanted to offer this, especially today, just based on recent conversations that I've been in with feedback from students in general,

235
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:25,070
Nathan, that you all that students in general and because of this very rigid protocol that we have, we come into the building, right?

236
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:31,850
We show a screen, we have a mask on, we sit in class, we go to class and then we all disperse.

237
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:38,210
Right. There is not any time for just kind of like normal interaction,

238
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:46,550
even if it's only a few minutes of opportunity to talk about things that are real right and highly relevant and important.

239
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:54,080
And I think that's been part of the, I think a shared frustration that maybe wasn't expected, right?

240
00:25:54,080 --> 00:26:02,360
It was like we were all caught off guard a little bit, both from a student perspective as well as from a from an instructor faculty perspective.

241
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:08,390
All right, we're finally back in person, right? How great it's going to be.

242
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:18,620
And it's, you know, it's it's good. It's better, but it's not, not at all what it was pre-pandemic, right?

243
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:27,440
And what we even maybe hoped we were going to be able to achieve or for having the real interactions that took place,

244
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:34,820
you know, in the hallway, right or in the common area or wherever it is that are harder and harder to come by right now.

245
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:38,490
And you know that that goes beyond classroom learning. Right?

246
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:46,850
That's about you. Learn something about an internship opportunity right through those like hallway discussions or some,

247
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:52,510
you know, research project to get involved in or where is a cool place to live next year.

248
00:26:52,510 --> 00:27:03,730
I mean, all of these things that like that don't have the same venue to be able to host, you know, in terms of just basic level of communication.

249
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:07,750
If anything else, it's just going back to this like basic level question,

250
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:18,430
we kind of went down like a really interesting and super valuable kind of radical but broad taking a step back now just with how folks are doing.

251
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:34,610
Are there other other things that are kind of weighing on people that we haven't discussed?

252
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:39,080
All right, well, thanks again, so much for sharing.

253
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:47,330
As far as this class goes, I'm going to continue to do as much as I can, right, in recognition of all these barriers and challenges.

254
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:54,890
I'm going to record, you know, and make those available to the Panopto recordings where they're not taking attendance in class, right?

255
00:27:54,890 --> 00:28:01,160
Yes, participation is a component of the course grade. But there's lots of ways to participate.

256
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:08,180
I'm not expecting that anyone is going to miss class, you know, for 14 weeks straight.

257
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:15,810
But uh, if there are other things that occur to you that you think I could,

258
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:22,940
you could suggest that I could implement in the classroom to help in this, you know, it might not last.

259
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:26,390
Caitlin mentioned it might not be something that's relevant now today,

260
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:30,860
but a week or two from now, right, as things kind of evolve, it might be more relevant.

261
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:39,620
So please don't hesitate to raise those things to me through an email before class, after class or whatever it is.

262
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:51,200
Thank you so much. All right, number three on our list updated the class schedule and I go pull up the canvas right here.

263
00:28:51,200 --> 00:29:00,680
There's been a couple of changes and I don't think they're ones that people are going to have any issues with scrolls a little bit.

264
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:11,620
So we are at the 25th today. Previously, on February eight, that set exam one.

265
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:24,730
And in order to accommodate the virtual tour of the human central power plant and their availability, we've needed to bump the exam back a week.

266
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:29,000
Does anyone strongly object to that?

267
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:40,180
OK, I wasn't expecting so, but if anyone did, let me know I'll talk about the exam first and then go to the steward.

268
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:45,670
So nothing about the exam will change because it's now one week later.

269
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:50,320
The content that you'll be examined on won't change.

270
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:58,000
It's still basically everything that will cover through February 1st through next week's class period.

271
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:03,610
So even though we're then going to go ahead and do this central power plant tour

272
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:08,680
and actually start to work on begin to work on an in-class project related to it,

273
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:19,870
nothing about what we discuss on February eight will be considered part of the material for the exam.

274
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:25,750
So it's, I think overall probably a benefit to have the exam pushed back one week.

275
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:36,850
One of the things that's not so beneficial is previously the topics of these two class periods used to be back to back, and they are no longer.

276
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:39,340
So it's going to be a little bit awkward.

277
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:48,820
We're going to have folks join us from the central power plant here in class that will actually give kind of a formal presentation with slides.

278
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:55,090
And then also have just a little bit of class discussion. Questions and answers and so forth.

279
00:30:55,090 --> 00:31:02,740
On the back side of that class period, well, actually, that bill they'll leave will thank them and thanks for joining us.

280
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:10,480
And as a class, they will dig into kind of the start of what this project will look like.

281
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:15,490
Then you're going to turn your focus back to the exam, right, and prepare for that in the coming week.

282
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:16,990
Do well on it.

283
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:23,890
And then when we come back together on the 22nd, it's going to be shifting that mindset back into this kind of being class project around it.

284
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:31,090
So that might be a little bit to manage and keep organized, which is maybe less beneficial with the schedule change.

285
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:39,060
But I did want to point that out. Any any questions?

286
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:47,940
OK. I was really I was caught off guard actually when I reached out in early January to the folks over at the power plant.

287
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:55,800
They've had this expansion project, which they're going to tell you all about going for for a few years now started actually before the pandemic.

288
00:31:55,800 --> 00:32:00,750
And then once COVID hit and with the various restrictions and so forth,

289
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:05,850
in-person tours were just, you know, not possible for a multiple, really important reason.

290
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:14,160
And when I reached out, they said, Well, how many students you have in the class? We've just started to do in-person tours again for small groups.

291
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:18,660
Unfortunately, the group has to be under 10 and we don't we don't fit that.

292
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:23,550
So they're still happy to come and kind of present and use slides and so forth.

293
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:31,290
But it's a really, really cool tour that maybe, hopefully during your time here, there'll be another opportunity,

294
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:41,250
if not as part of this class, and it's something that we can arrange in the future for anyone who's interested as a follow up.

295
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:45,610
OK. So I think that was what I wanted to highlight there.

296
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:51,750
Let's go back to this slide. We talked about updated class schedule.

297
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:59,100
All right. So turning to term project topics.

298
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:04,380
So actually, it was on the campus site. Those are due today.

299
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:08,100
Several of you have sent those to me already.

300
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:14,640
Thank you very much. Um, several of you have done it a few days ago, several days ago.

301
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,270
So you early. Really good job. Others have. You haven't yet.

302
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:26,520
So if you haven't yet, please go ahead just by email. Send me a draft title, a sentence or two description of what you're thinking.

303
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:30,350
And I can give some feedback. All right.

304
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:40,770
Since I wasn't here earlier, earlier weeks for for that, are most assignments going to be via email and will there not be campus based?

305
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:53,490
So for the paper, for the project, yeah, I'll have like an assignment where you submit it, you know, upload your uh, for the abstract.

306
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:58,540
You folks have a strong preference. This is something that you know, this is a challenge.

307
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:03,810
Are are people okay? Emailing me, you know, small amounts of text.

308
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:07,080
I just think I'm nuts, but you don't have to agree with it.

309
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:12,750
Would you folks prefer using the canvas mechanism for submitting?

310
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:17,040
It's mixed. Well, you have a comment.

311
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:23,790
Sometimes it's easier when there's like you can just click on an assignment tab on canvas and then see everything, especially since for this class,

312
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:30,060
there's not that many things would be nice, I think, to be able to like, click and see the description, even if we're not submitting it to there.

313
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:34,020
Just like, I don't know right now, it's on the syllabus from an organizational perspective.

314
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:40,810
Yeah. And then like it shows up on people's canvas dashboard. OK, now like I look at like the upcoming OK.

315
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:44,520
OK, so how about this? I think I can do both.

316
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:48,720
It's a small enough group, right? If this was like a hundred and fifty students or something, I wouldn't order it.

317
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:53,610
But this with this number, I'll do both. I'll make an assignment.

318
00:34:53,610 --> 00:35:03,650
You can submit it that way. But if you also just want to email something to me, that's not that's not much effort for me to to keep track of.

319
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:11,360
So, so that's today is just the topic, uh, there'll be some feedback.

320
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:16,520
Did you have any examples of what people have done like concerns?

321
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:26,250
Yes, you already did this, but I missed it. No, we have not discussed that, but I do have an activity that I think might help address a little bit.

322
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:32,330
Um, so today is the topic this evening.

323
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:36,950
I was kind of waiting until I got most of the topic ideas from everyone.

324
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:41,600
Part of my feedback is to mitigate any like overlapping topics, right?

325
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:46,220
So that's kind of why I pulled back from giving any specific feedback this evening.

326
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:51,140
I'll respond to all of you with some feedback specific to yours.

327
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:53,990
And then next week, it's an abstract.

328
00:35:53,990 --> 00:36:01,310
So it's just a little bit more development that we're talking a page between a half a page to one page, please no more than one page.

329
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:08,420
Maybe that will be a challenge to you. Um, but just to kind of develop your thought a bit further, that will be due next week.

330
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:13,040
I'll make an assignment and canvas. You can also email it to me.

331
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:22,430
But what I was going to suggest is that we actually take a little bit of time here in class and discuss.

332
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:29,450
So for those of you that have already turned it in, you're totally fine. For those of you who haven't yet, I put you on the spot a little bit.

333
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:32,390
So how about if we just kind of go through the room?

334
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:38,450
And part of my rationale for doing this is kind of like this to address your questions to the extent that it actually

335
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:46,610
helps you think about your own project by hearing what other folks ideas have in the way that they're approaching things.

336
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:49,880
Not that you're going to like, take their idea and duplicate it,

337
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:56,240
but that the way that the context that people are approaching it, I think previously we started in the back.

338
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:01,850
So what? Mix it up and start maybe in the front and zigzag our way back.

339
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:06,740
You don't need to spend, you know, an elaborate amount of time to explain it.

340
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:12,890
Maybe keep it somewhere between 30 and 60 seconds, something like that.

341
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:18,170
So the one that I'm in, something I'm interested in writing my term paper about is like indigenous water rights.

342
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:23,480
And so I particularly focused around like Native Hawaiians rights to Redhill

343
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:31,780
and then also to the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and the Delta Access Pipeline.

344
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:35,860
Which my feedback is going to start with tonight when I get to sending those emails.

345
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:42,880
Very cool. What a great topic, and I should preface this actually before we started the process.

346
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:53,170
The general feedback that I'll give to everybody, um, is to to narrow this scope as much as possible.

347
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:56,980
And then some of you have emailed me topics that are very broad.

348
00:37:56,980 --> 00:38:04,720
It's like an entire legislative package, which is really hard to try to tackle for the focus of a of a term project paper.

349
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,780
So it's great you're starting with something,

350
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:13,510
but that's going to be the general feedback I'm giving to almost everyone is now that you have this topic,

351
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:20,260
continue to try to refine it and narrow the scope. That's going to allow you to go into more depth than the way that you tackle it.

352
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:28,030
You've achieved, I think, already a fair amount of a narrow focus, which is awesome in the topics I'm really, really interested in.

353
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:33,390
Thank you so much. Yeah. So I was thinking about my I.

354
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:41,140
So that is a pretty broad. Generally, like the topic of antibiotics and the environment and like how they are just like

355
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:45,970
kind of in the environment now due to the use of them in livestock raising.

356
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:53,200
So that's probably how we'll begin to narrow it is to think about how waste is managed and how antibiotics are used in that setting.

357
00:38:53,200 --> 00:39:00,100
And like potentially, I guess, how that's regulated by policy currently or if it's not at all.

358
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:02,680
I honestly don't know a lot about the policy side of it,

359
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:12,550
but I know that that's an issue that is considered to become a bigger and bigger problem in the years coming as like

360
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:19,480
antibiotic resistance in the environment then gets higher and starts infecting people with antibiotic resistant.

361
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:25,930
Yes, it is bacteria, so a big area of concern. I absolutely agree, and I think that's a that's a great topic.

362
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:32,020
And yet just in general, you know, the more that you can narrow the focus, the better.

363
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:40,570
So I always wanted to look into like the Superfund areas and the Superfund law, which I'm realizing is super broad.

364
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:46,600
So I don't really know much about it, my friend, who's an apartment major, that it would be interesting to look into.

365
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:50,900
Um, so yeah, I guess I'll narrow it down.

366
00:39:50,900 --> 00:40:01,480
Yes, maybe like a specific area or something. Yeah. And you know, just a thought might be to, um, to pick a couple of cases, right?

367
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:11,020
One way. And this applies to everyone that if you want to tackle a topic is is to pick two examples

368
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:17,710
to compare and contrast within within a policy framework that that can be very effective.

369
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:22,480
Um, in helping to kind of draw out the analysis that you're trying to accomplish.

370
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:27,340
So this might be something that you you consider your focus is around Superfund.

371
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:35,980
There are some really interesting cases out there within that that ball under that that you might use for for relevant reasons,

372
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:41,260
right to to be able to compare contrast. Perhaps they're quite similar and the differences are subtle.

373
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:45,310
Or perhaps they're different, you know, on purpose. And that's the kind of your rationale.

374
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:49,360
Kind it. Thank you. Awesome. Oh yeah.

375
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:55,300
So I was kind of thinking of doing some work on the Tough Substances Control Act and so kind of get very

376
00:40:55,300 --> 00:41:02,890
into the weeds of how exactly to classify substances as harmful or not because you can look into the truth,

377
00:41:02,890 --> 00:41:11,830
cancer and non-cancer risk very differently. And there's been no water and power amendments kind of get water better,

378
00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:21,790
but I don't want to see how we can shift from reactive to like almost more like you reach kind of a preventative approach and like,

379
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:25,630
it's almost purposefully complex, needlessly complex.

380
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:31,090
In many ways, we're going to ask if they will keep the public from kind of knowing myself and stuff.

381
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:34,210
It's that kind of hard to get. Sure. Sure, that's that's great.

382
00:41:34,210 --> 00:41:41,110
And that's I mean, I think you already came up with some really cool potential contrast, right with reach, you know, for example.

383
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:53,050
And you know, one idea that comes to mind is just picking a contaminant, uh, setting an exposure setting.

384
00:41:53,050 --> 00:42:01,540
And, you know, see how differently they're they're managed from a policy perspective within something like Tasca.

385
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:07,840
And it sounds really good jobs, I think over here.

386
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:12,730
Yeah, I honestly like I emailed you an idea, but it's kind of really brought more in here.

387
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:18,060
You're going to say to them, I've researched it. I think I'm not really sure where it is, but what I had written down.

388
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:23,410
I said something about toxic exposure to the pollutants from different products impacts.

389
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:30,130
You're not sure whether I'd want to do fertility outcomes of mothers living in certain areas or live health or development of children.

390
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:37,340
And there's. Interrelated with different. And there's one thing that I'm going to upset some spelling call or the disclosure

391
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:42,740
of certain chemicals or toxic toxins that companies are using or really factories,

392
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:50,330
or whether they will go into those in some areas, whether that is disclosed to local and state governments.

393
00:42:50,330 --> 00:42:53,870
Right, right. Exactly. Yeah, yeah.

394
00:42:53,870 --> 00:43:01,010
And we can we can have them back and forth to kind of help narrow that to something that's of interest to you.

395
00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:06,590
Um, but it might, you know, not that I want to send you off on like reading entire legislative acts,

396
00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:17,440
but what Josh was mentioning between the task, which is the US federal policy and then Reach, which is European Union federal based policy.

397
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:24,600
There are two very different approaches to to addressing this problem and or not addressing this problem.

398
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:27,920
That's a good idea. Thank you. That's cool. Yeah.

399
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:34,340
Well, it's also pretty broad, but I wanted to touch on like international trade and then environmental policies.

400
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:38,960
So obviously trade certain countries and areas has a lot of pollution.

401
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:49,870
And then maybe seeing like what like environmental policy or. Like that, or like incentives for sustainable trade very broadly now,

402
00:43:49,870 --> 00:43:55,900
but I'm thinking of even like choosing two countries and seeing that what's been effective and what hasn't?

403
00:43:55,900 --> 00:44:00,310
Sure, sure. And I mean that one that one's tough.

404
00:44:00,310 --> 00:44:06,670
It's broad, as it can be super interesting topic and highly relevant. So I applaud you for that.

405
00:44:06,670 --> 00:44:13,120
Narrowing it, you have a couple of different directions you might consider.

406
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:13,780
Again, it might.

407
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:26,170
There might be a specific environmental health exposure issue contaminant if you, um and go from there and then assess like specific to that.

408
00:44:26,170 --> 00:44:34,080
What types of policy approaches? Three. Tariffs, whatever might be effective with it.

409
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:45,270
I mean, one of the. Very quickly evolving issues around electric vehicles.

410
00:44:45,270 --> 00:44:51,840
Is the mining of all the products that are needed to make the batteries for the electric vehicle where right,

411
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:57,250
where those elements of the metals come from something like that?

412
00:44:57,250 --> 00:45:03,210
Right. And I'm not suggesting you study electric vehicles and mining of batteries, but we're here for batteries,

413
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:13,140
but trying to maybe start with a specific environmental health issue and then look at it through the lens or scope of international trade taxes,

414
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:19,320
tariffs and so forth. And I also want to invite, you know, I can give you some feedback,

415
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:23,550
but it's already happened a couple of times where others have, you know, ideas or suggestions.

416
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:31,500
Please go ahead and speak to those on the policy to like those words.

417
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:38,610
We call order adjustments right. Or I've seen those that I called where I just trying to think is that the terms there are multiple

418
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:46,080
different terms for like applying U.S. regulations to countries like kind of the climate change report,

419
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:53,760
the carbon border. Right, right, right. Right. Yeah. And there's I mean, there's it's a it's a given broader topic than than that.

420
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:58,020
Um, but yeah, that's one. One important component to it, for sure.

421
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:06,060
And. So I'm interested in investigating like oil pipelines and both the like health effects and

422
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:11,520
social impacts and environmental impacts they have on the areas that are implemented,

423
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:18,150
especially in native populations. So what's the field focusing on like the Keystone XL and Dakota Access Pipeline?

424
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:24,720
Those were like the normal that I about free.

425
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:27,000
I know those were some pretty hot topics couple of years ago,

426
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:35,940
so I'm hoping there's more like formal research on other their impacts or like looking at these older ones and why this happened.

427
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:43,020
So so perhaps I could find and compare and contrast scenario. Okay, that sounds great.

428
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:54,600
I do not have an idea yet. So any anything at all that you're just wondering about, you know, I'm for it seems like a good thing.

429
00:46:54,600 --> 00:47:03,660
Yeah. And I'm kind of thinking like maybe do something like climate change, like international policy right now, I'm up to that as lot.

430
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:10,680
So, yeah, we'll see. But with most of these, you know, they have a very broad basis, right?

431
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:14,400
And that's the challenge that every student has to face in their focus.

432
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:19,710
So don't don't be afraid, you know, don't be dissuaded because what you're thinking is is big.

433
00:47:19,710 --> 00:47:25,280
We can we can work to narrow it.

434
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:32,540
Yet another suggestion for anybody who's still on the fence, and we haven't got that memo yet because we started in the front this time.

435
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:36,350
But Emma actually has an idea that's a bit more occupational focused, right?

436
00:47:36,350 --> 00:47:43,970
And so I was kind of encouraging like, I kind of bring a bias. My own kind of research interests are more kind of community environmental oriented.

437
00:47:43,970 --> 00:47:49,040
And so I try to guard against that a little bit and try to mix in as much as I can.

438
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:56,300
You know, occupational based, workplace based health and safety issues, environmental exposure issues into the class.

439
00:47:56,300 --> 00:48:05,270
But you have a case study focused on ergonomics, which is one of the way, um, from that standpoint as well, that might be something to consider.

440
00:48:05,270 --> 00:48:12,800
The workplace is much more controlled with from a policy perspective and in for a longer history of it.

441
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:21,380
But severely lacking still, depending on, you know, where and what type of industry.

442
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:33,110
So let's I guess we're going to that corner feeling. Yeah, so the one kind of broad idea I have right now is I was a microbiome leader in undergrad,

443
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:40,400
so I like I like microbes, but I thought it'd be cool to do something on a nutrient pollution and half of a bloom.

444
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:47,750
And I don't know whether that relate to like policy interventions to just reduce the nutrient pollution or like trapping I.

445
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:53,300
And for my job, I sat on this like this meeting government.

446
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:59,300
But there'll be a lot of like a big problem they said was like they make these action plans and like,

447
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:06,740
they're not necessarily seeing the results they want, but they don't know whether that's because the action plan is failing or because the

448
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:13,650
landowners are actually implementing look like they're not actually reacting like that.

449
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:20,990
So like, I don't know if there could be maybe a policy to track whether I don't even know that's like a policy related thing.

450
00:49:20,990 --> 00:49:23,330
But yeah, that was something that stuck with me.

451
00:49:23,330 --> 00:49:28,880
And then also just like taking a one off approach towards like monitoring the environment and like a huge

452
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:34,590
weakness we have is like human and animal exposure events as well as like the diagnostic tool we know.

453
00:49:34,590 --> 00:49:44,810
So yeah, and then another broad thing is just a policy to like bush kind of like a basically it's like something that would

454
00:49:44,810 --> 00:49:50,870
establish more of the precautionary principle when it comes to a lot of a lot of the environmental law issues,

455
00:49:50,870 --> 00:49:55,940
we're kind of like tackling problems as because like they're occurring rather than like the prevention standpoint.

456
00:49:55,940 --> 00:50:03,770
So it's like maybe policies to like, push these kind of like checkpoints, like in lieu of not having a scientific evidence,

457
00:50:03,770 --> 00:50:10,760
like maybe there should be like almost like a punishment if you just skip over like this because we don't know, it doesn't mean we shouldn't.

458
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:14,970
Yeah, yeah. So I don't really know about the policy either.

459
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:23,210
But yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, just really quick feedback on what you started with with the nutrient contamination, right?

460
00:50:23,210 --> 00:50:28,490
And, you know, algal blooms water. This is this is, uh, this is a really interesting topic.

461
00:50:28,490 --> 00:50:36,470
And unfortunately, it's not something that, you know, on the downside, it's it's worsening, right with time and with with space especially.

462
00:50:36,470 --> 00:50:43,220
And it's also one that would be really conducive to comparing and contrasting

463
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:47,900
very different like geographical areas or chronic water bodies or whatever.

464
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:54,270
Um, whether it's domestic or even comparing, uh, you know, internationally,

465
00:50:54,270 --> 00:50:59,660
but the different approaches, different policies a.k.a. lack of policy or lack of effective policy.

466
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:05,600
And then you mentioned like tracking, right? And kind of questioning whether that's part of policy.

467
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:15,580
Absolutely. Tracking would kind of fall under the or be equivalent to monitoring in a way that you would think of it or consider it for sure.

468
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:18,710
Yeah. Awesome. Thank you, Emma. Yeah.

469
00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:28,760
So I look forward to ideas and find leaning towards, um, to like parallel policy for staff in hospitals and like nurses,

470
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:39,560
especially when I feel like that's a really big thing now. And so like kind of examining how the nation works and how do they help reduce burnout?

471
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:46,590
Who is like? There's definitely stuff because I know a lot of nurses who are kind of front guys scandals and then they have time on,

472
00:51:46,590 --> 00:51:55,190
but it's like the best way to do it. So, yeah, my second option was like, sit there policies and take care of them at school.

473
00:51:55,190 --> 00:52:00,050
And like one, do a lot of things that you know, my life, like I was in daycare, wasn't like,

474
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:07,800
you have to even throw up like a few times, just like, that's not maybe the best way to do that.

475
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:14,870
So, yeah, but I'm leaning more towards the first one to learn how to be a little bit more research about it.

476
00:52:14,870 --> 00:52:24,620
And that was going to be my feedback, as well as to suggest the nursing situation and health care scenarios that couldn't be a hotter,

477
00:52:24,620 --> 00:52:29,810
more relevant right topic without without answers or solutions do.

478
00:52:29,810 --> 00:52:40,850
So, you know, I can hear your product might be distributable at the end of the semester to some decent folks that would be interested in feeding.

479
00:52:40,850 --> 00:52:48,560
Thank you so much. Yeah, I know I'm thinking about like housing infrastructure, and I found recently, like,

480
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:52,430
there are some bills like being proposed at the federal level and like the

481
00:52:52,430 --> 00:52:59,300
House and Senate related to like basically creating like funding specifically

482
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:10,430
for updating housing infrastructure and different states specifically like in vulnerable populations like bring them up to date because a lot of um,

483
00:53:10,430 --> 00:53:18,470
like housing is. Today and the greenhouse in preventing like, of course, like blood poisoning.

484
00:53:18,470 --> 00:53:22,030
Not like indoor air pollution issues.

485
00:53:22,030 --> 00:53:29,350
So yeah, that's kind of what I'm thinking of a party from like to I'm like, what do you call it like?

486
00:53:29,350 --> 00:53:35,290
I guess, like like sources that like relate specifically to these policies when they're being proposed,

487
00:53:35,290 --> 00:53:40,570
really, you know, like, I like Bernie Sanders, apparently.

488
00:53:40,570 --> 00:53:46,120
So like trying to just like I can't figure out like how I want to,

489
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:50,440
it would be good thing, but I think it also relates to doing a lot of background music.

490
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:54,190
Sure, sure. Yeah, I think that's going to be your challenge, right?

491
00:53:54,190 --> 00:54:03,190
Because there's going to be so much of interest to you. And my my feedback is maybe looking at it two different ways.

492
00:54:03,190 --> 00:54:15,400
One is focus on a particular piece of policy like you talked about housing policy and explore how many different

493
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:24,100
kind of environmental exposure issues could be addressed through housing policy and or take a specific,

494
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:30,190
I guess, ED board. Oh, it's an art or take something like away.

495
00:54:30,190 --> 00:54:33,920
Right? But then not limit yourself to housing policy.

496
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:42,190
Say, OK, we're worried about environmental exposures to lead through how many other, more indirect policy routes could.

497
00:54:42,190 --> 00:54:49,000
Could we effectively address mitigating, you know, net exposures, something like that.

498
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:58,390
But it's really great ideas. Nice, nice work. And so I was looking into the Endangered Species Act of 2020 and how different the

499
00:54:58,390 --> 00:55:03,040
federal local state governments work together to help those species environment.

500
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:06,790
And I guess, like the community indirectly, I just didn't know.

501
00:55:06,790 --> 00:55:12,400
Should I take the lines of just one species that interests me, or maybe multiple, but in the same area?

502
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:16,330
Yeah, that's a great idea. I love the topic.

503
00:55:16,330 --> 00:55:24,940
And then, yeah, what you just kind of finished with would be, you might think that maybe take us to two different examples that are a little bit

504
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:29,620
different from each other and use that as a kind of a compare contrast mechanism.

505
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:41,970
And you may be able to highlight other areas where where the acts are effective and maybe where they fall short something along those lines.

506
00:55:41,970 --> 00:55:52,610
Yeah, that's cool. And last but not least, yeah, I was kind of reading about our data support system that you have inside, particularly a black hole.

507
00:55:52,610 --> 00:55:57,100
And you know, and I remember being here several months ago.

508
00:55:57,100 --> 00:56:07,120
Is there a really clear environmental justice issue in this case? I also think it might delve into the probability and be responsible for updating

509
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:12,310
things you considering these kind of steps towards the residents in South Carolina.

510
00:56:12,310 --> 00:56:17,080
Very little. Right, right. Oh, that's a that's a great, great topic.

511
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:22,430
And you know, unfortunately, you don't have to go far geographically, you know, right here in Shelby, Michigan.

512
00:56:22,430 --> 00:56:26,740
That would be a problem that I guess I would ignore would be my only other suggestion.

513
00:56:26,740 --> 00:56:28,480
If you might, you might want to,

514
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:35,530
whether it's whether you can find two very different scenarios that are close in proximity geographically or if you just want to purposefully,

515
00:56:35,530 --> 00:56:45,640
like, prepare something in two different areas and regions, one that you know is more successful or has been kind of a partial solution to the issue,

516
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:51,310
whereas in others where the where the need is still there and you know, what are the challenges in place and so forth?

517
00:56:51,310 --> 00:56:59,570
Sounds great. Very cool. Well, thank you so much for that and for sharing those and hopefully with a little bit

518
00:56:59,570 --> 00:57:04,660
of a benefit as well to kind of hear from each other what you're all thinking.

519
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:09,580
This is going to be cool, right? I think we'll take, you know, with your abstract submission.

520
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:17,650
Next week, we'll spend a little bit of time in class as well if you kind of do like a round robin and let people share or even prompt questions.

521
00:57:17,650 --> 00:57:24,400
And at that point, you know, addition to my own feedback, you might be able to get a little bit of input from your from your peers.

522
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:28,570
But to see this develop over the course of the semester, right, we're going to get to the end where,

523
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:33,550
yes, I'll get to read all of your papers, but you'll all have a chance to present to your classmates.

524
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:42,790
So for me, a little bit of anticipation from everyone. So I'm paying attention at the time we are at one fifty eight.

525
00:57:42,790 --> 00:57:49,960
Let's go ahead and do our kind of middle class break. Uh, it's just my phone is flipped to 159.

526
00:57:49,960 --> 00:58:05,109
Let's, let's say two or five will kind of reconvene here back in the classroom.

527
00:58:07,338 --> 00:58:12,578
Yeah, it's like there's like a bit of work.

528
00:58:12,578 --> 00:58:15,818
Yeah, you can only take a few times like they diver.

529
00:58:15,818 --> 00:58:27,308
And then there's like, we discussed this with chefs and we go so hard as we are going through and talking about this one,

530
00:58:27,308 --> 00:58:29,108
this topic, how's everyone doing?

531
00:58:29,108 --> 00:58:36,908
And we were talking about, you know, issues on campus and miscommunications or poor communication and understandings.

532
00:58:36,908 --> 00:58:44,288
There was a thought that came to my mind and it escaped and I wasn't able to bring it up and I wanted to go ahead and do that now.

533
00:58:44,288 --> 00:58:49,738
How many of you have been in the classroom? Uh, well, I guess it could have been last year.

534
00:58:49,738 --> 00:58:57,688
Or this year where there was monitoring going on in your in your classroom.

535
00:58:57,688 --> 00:59:03,598
Two. OK, the two of you. So, yeah, so this is something I wanted to share.

536
00:59:03,598 --> 00:59:07,768
And you know, we're all a little bit of an expert on certain things,

537
00:59:07,768 --> 00:59:13,338
so I'm not afraid to kind of share my own perspective on some of the things we're talking about.

538
00:59:13,338 --> 00:59:23,488
Um, there's a large, externally funded project going on on campus right now around wastewater.

539
00:59:23,488 --> 00:59:28,108
So sampling wastewater across many on campus buildings,

540
00:59:28,108 --> 00:59:36,898
as well as off campus residential complexes that have a high fraction of university students living in them.

541
00:59:36,898 --> 00:59:42,238
And it's supporting the concept of something called the wastewater epidemiology.

542
00:59:42,238 --> 00:59:46,798
So those samples are analyzed here in the School of Public Health.

543
00:59:46,798 --> 00:59:57,958
One of my colleagues, I'm part of this project and it's looking at basically RNA fragments that are in waste that are excreted,

544
00:59:57,958 --> 01:00:05,338
that are basically serve as a tracer of the level of virus prevalence within a building, right?

545
01:00:05,338 --> 01:00:09,868
So it's it's very qualitative, but it has a pretty high detection limit.

546
01:00:09,868 --> 01:00:17,008
And so it doesn't take a major outbreak to detect a positive case somewhere in that building.

547
01:00:17,008 --> 01:00:22,618
A much, much smaller component of that project that is internally funded,

548
01:00:22,618 --> 01:00:30,298
kind of as a pilot that has turned out to be pretty informative to in all of this data, go straight to the campus.

549
01:00:30,298 --> 01:00:31,738
I forget the acronym for it,

550
01:00:31,738 --> 01:00:42,328
but how something something something group that basically distributes all the campus policies around related to the pandemic,

551
01:00:42,328 --> 01:00:51,508
so they receive weekly data on this. A small part of this project in the pilot was looking is doing environmental monitoring,

552
01:00:51,508 --> 01:01:01,618
indoor environmental micro environmental monitoring for the same presence of these SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments.

553
01:01:01,618 --> 01:01:09,068
So that is involves doing air sampling in various places across campus.

554
01:01:09,068 --> 01:01:17,428
Um, it's involved some common areas in dorms, in rec buildings, in classrooms.

555
01:01:17,428 --> 01:01:24,598
And in addition to the air samples, which is an active air sampler, um, it's a little bit noisy for the two of you that experience it right?

556
01:01:24,598 --> 01:01:35,008
It's slightly distracting, but the goal is hopefully not too much, but it's actually pulling air through and it ends up with a small lot of sample,

557
01:01:35,008 --> 01:01:41,938
liquid sample and purified water, and then that goes and gets analyzed through the PCR.

558
01:01:41,938 --> 01:01:48,748
And the second component that is surface sampling.

559
01:01:48,748 --> 01:01:52,458
So using a pretty crude approach, but it's pretty effective.

560
01:01:52,458 --> 01:02:02,248
These surface wipes. And so whether at one of the campus buildings or in a classroom after the class has let out,

561
01:02:02,248 --> 01:02:08,108
one of the project's staff would go around and swipe basically high contact surfaces.

562
01:02:08,108 --> 01:02:08,338
Right.

563
01:02:08,338 --> 01:02:16,708
So after we leave, for example, somebody might do the keyboard, you know where you've been sitting, the doorknobs in the classroom and so forth.

564
01:02:16,708 --> 01:02:27,958
In the building, they're doing weight benches and all the water and whatever else might be kind of a high contact surface.

565
01:02:27,958 --> 01:02:38,338
And I can share with you the sense this started, which is going back to the fall of 2020, its pilot funds.

566
01:02:38,338 --> 01:02:41,728
So it's not like it's been every classroom since it closed.

567
01:02:41,728 --> 01:02:44,308
It's a very, very small fraction of classrooms.

568
01:02:44,308 --> 01:02:51,358
They've hopefully been representative classrooms, but we were talking about spread right or not in classrooms,

569
01:02:51,358 --> 01:03:03,208
and we've not had a single positive sample in a classroom for one to three.

570
01:03:03,208 --> 01:03:07,288
This is the fourth semester of doing this.

571
01:03:07,288 --> 01:03:16,468
So it's not an assurance, it's that we can't prove that transmission is not happening in the classroom.

572
01:03:16,468 --> 01:03:22,258
Um, that the approach has a detection limit, right?

573
01:03:22,258 --> 01:03:32,578
And so it's possible that transmission can occur, uh, with resulting viral load on surfaces,

574
01:03:32,578 --> 01:03:37,318
that's below the detection limit of our of our method in our approach.

575
01:03:37,318 --> 01:03:41,678
We don't feel that's the case, but it's possible and there's no way to know it.

576
01:03:41,678 --> 01:03:54,138
Um, but it's it's pretty sensitive what we what we would detect as a positive sample is dead virus at that point.

577
01:03:54,138 --> 01:04:00,308
Right. We're not looking to culture and determine. Live virus or active virus?

578
01:04:00,308 --> 01:04:05,408
These are just fragments of the virus that remain, and we don't we don't see those.

579
01:04:05,408 --> 01:04:12,578
So the conclusion so far there's a manuscript that's been submitted to a peer reviewed journal that's under review right now.

580
01:04:12,578 --> 01:04:21,398
Um, the conclusion is that and again, we uh, what was submitted and what's been analyzed was kind of pre Omicron, right,

581
01:04:21,398 --> 01:04:34,328
which is a whole nother layer of, uh, viral load and how contagious it is and so forth in terms of transmission or highly transmissible.

582
01:04:34,328 --> 01:04:41,318
But the conclusion so far is that the mitigation strategies in these classrooms with masking,

583
01:04:41,318 --> 01:04:48,038
with vaccination being required, um, we talked about that inconsistency in distancing in the classrooms, right?

584
01:04:48,038 --> 01:04:54,788
Some classrooms have quite a bit of distancing between, uh, you know, allocated seats and others.

585
01:04:54,788 --> 01:05:04,358
Not so much, I think, in this classroom. Um, but it seems to be effective, you know, that multilayered approach as far as that,

586
01:05:04,358 --> 01:05:11,978
that would be an interpretation from the micro environmental sampling that we've been doing from the surface waves and the indoor classroom.

587
01:05:11,978 --> 01:05:19,778
Air sampling is we don't see, uh, or, you know, SARS-CoV-2 RNA in any of these samples.

588
01:05:19,778 --> 01:05:26,138
Um, I don't know. It's it's not something you can say, Oh, I don't have to worry, right?

589
01:05:26,138 --> 01:05:36,158
But it's it's uh, it's data that that kind of supports continuing to practice these, these protocols that are in place.

590
01:05:36,158 --> 01:05:41,388
Anybody have any any questions or or comments about that?

591
01:05:41,388 --> 01:05:50,968
Actually, have a slide, I can bring a data slide, but kind of helps you envision what this what this looks like with some photos.

592
01:05:50,968 --> 01:05:59,008
All right, cool. Anyway, that was something that was it was in my mind, and then it was gone as we were kind of moving from one topic to the next.

593
01:05:59,008 --> 01:06:05,908
The last one on this slide. Thanks to all of you that have weighed in.

594
01:06:05,908 --> 01:06:07,798
I have it all.

595
01:06:07,798 --> 01:06:18,418
I wasn't organized to actually have a slide displaying it, but I will this evening as I'm responding to everybody on your term project topic.

596
01:06:18,418 --> 01:06:29,318
I will also just post like a canvas announcement that that list was assigned to which a student led class discussions.

597
01:06:29,318 --> 01:06:39,488
So that's more of an update, and then this one with many thanks to Victoria, she sent this article yesterday.

598
01:06:39,488 --> 01:06:48,038
I converted it into a kind of a messy PDF. I don't know how to get rid of all the advertisements and stuff it's in, like newspaper or online.

599
01:06:48,038 --> 01:06:52,598
But anyway, I posted it onto the canvas late this morning.

600
01:06:52,598 --> 01:06:55,728
Really cool article. I made a slide out of it.

601
01:06:55,728 --> 01:07:00,668
I'm going to invite Victoria if you want to introduce what caught your eye about this.

602
01:07:00,668 --> 01:07:05,318
Sure. I mean, I feel like many of us are in Michigan.

603
01:07:05,318 --> 01:07:10,448
Kind of know you become a baby tour guide and like the sixth grade when they teach you about the Great Lakes.

604
01:07:10,448 --> 01:07:14,708
But I found this one particularly interesting because it talks about the Great Lakes compact

605
01:07:14,708 --> 01:07:20,948
and kind of policy around the way that we can distribute water from the Great Lakes.

606
01:07:20,948 --> 01:07:31,448
And this one was particularly talking about an understanding of climate change and the need for fresh water and safe fresh water,

607
01:07:31,448 --> 01:07:42,188
especially in the coming years and lack of safe fresh water that it is going to happen of having more clear policy around the way that we distribute

608
01:07:42,188 --> 01:07:52,328
water from the Great Lakes is going to be necessary and also needs to be updated because of things that we've learned about rights to water.

609
01:07:52,328 --> 01:07:55,568
The way we should talk about water, indigenous rights to water,

610
01:07:55,568 --> 01:08:00,578
all these other things that have developed since the Great Lakes contacts first formed.

611
01:08:00,578 --> 01:08:04,388
And then also what was interesting was that Ontario, in fact,

612
01:08:04,388 --> 01:08:11,288
the two provinces of Canada that also border the Great Lakes are not legally bound within the Great Lakes compact,

613
01:08:11,288 --> 01:08:16,508
even though they do what other lakes are there voluntarily so they can really do what they want?

614
01:08:16,508 --> 01:08:23,648
They just choose not to. Thank you to our Canadian neighbors.

615
01:08:23,648 --> 01:08:30,638
Thanks so much for sharing that, Victoria. So do you folks have any reactions or comments?

616
01:08:30,638 --> 01:08:34,778
Or maybe this is something you've looked at a little bit previously?

617
01:08:34,778 --> 01:08:40,058
I thought this article was really cool and like I've been, I'm from Michigan, so I've been here my whole life.

618
01:08:40,058 --> 01:08:47,198
And like, I feel like every four or five years, there's like whispers of like from white people out of state or like,

619
01:08:47,198 --> 01:08:52,478
we should divert the water to California or something like that and like it just always kind of never dies.

620
01:08:52,478 --> 01:09:00,728
So it's kind of I've always addressed it. Can they come back, come back on and on, read the book that the guy mentioned in a book there.

621
01:09:00,728 --> 01:09:02,198
And actually, that's really good about the Great Lakes.

622
01:09:02,198 --> 01:09:07,538
It's called the Death and Life of the Great Lakes by Dan Egan, and it goes right really into the history of the Great Lakes.

623
01:09:07,538 --> 01:09:14,348
And like, I think just how much like man made engineering has already happened in the Great Lakes,

624
01:09:14,348 --> 01:09:20,918
especially with regards to fish populations, is pretty crazy, and it's not really as natural as we think at this point.

625
01:09:20,918 --> 01:09:26,758
So, yeah, all Michiganders like zebra mussels and Asian carp, it's like part of our personnel.

626
01:09:26,758 --> 01:09:28,058
And I think at this point,

627
01:09:28,058 --> 01:09:43,318
so and I I'm not going to go into the bizarre or invasive species collaborative to see here that terrible, scary looking, in fact.

628
01:09:43,318 --> 01:09:53,368
Any other comments or even questions? Yeah, it's a go and take a look, it's posted on a canvas site.

629
01:09:53,368 --> 01:09:57,598
It's really a short read. Actually, it's not anything to me.

630
01:09:57,598 --> 01:10:00,288
The book itself might be a little bit different, although it night.

631
01:10:00,288 --> 01:10:06,598
I think the the the person who wrote the story mentions that it's a great compact book itself.

632
01:10:06,598 --> 01:10:15,298
So, yeah, so maybe the book itself is something to check out. A couple of things that struck me in the article and actually you raised the point.

633
01:10:15,298 --> 01:10:23,878
Victoria as a statistic that 20 percent of the world's freshwater resides in the Great Lakes surrounding us.

634
01:10:23,878 --> 01:10:32,068
You don't hear as we speak. That's a lot. Uh, and the article in the book, I think, alludes to more.

635
01:10:32,068 --> 01:10:37,948
We think about the surface water component, but the groundwater is a huge issue as well.

636
01:10:37,948 --> 01:10:46,348
There's been talk about policy issues. This might be a policy topic for anyone who's who's still looking for something different,

637
01:10:46,348 --> 01:10:54,178
but the company nationally with the the label is Ice Mountain, right?

638
01:10:54,178 --> 01:10:58,438
Anybody who's bought bottled water that says Ice Mountain, they're using that.

639
01:10:58,438 --> 01:11:08,338
It's owned by Nestle, and they have a lot of, call it, a mine, right where they basically have gotten rights from the state to set up.

640
01:11:08,338 --> 01:11:12,868
It's like sitting in Central Michigan, the central lower peninsula ish.

641
01:11:12,868 --> 01:11:20,398
Yeah, my geography is not strong, but yeah, they're it's like pulling up tons of groundwater in Michigan,

642
01:11:20,398 --> 01:11:25,708
sticking it in plastic bottles, you know, backing into cases and shipping it all over the place.

643
01:11:25,708 --> 01:11:29,878
Know to be sold on grocery store shelves. Yeah.

644
01:11:29,878 --> 01:11:36,748
And if I remember correctly like the way they got rights from the state was under a kind of shady go like,

645
01:11:36,748 --> 01:11:40,678
Oh, we're doing this to help the farmers and like help local agriculture.

646
01:11:40,678 --> 01:11:44,788
And then but obviously they're right. Yeah, yeah.

647
01:11:44,788 --> 01:11:49,808
Don't buy products mostly shady for other reasons besides.

648
01:11:49,808 --> 01:11:54,328
So that's the article.

649
01:11:54,328 --> 01:11:59,128
It's actually in the first sentence there. And then and Josh alluded to it as well.

650
01:11:59,128 --> 01:12:03,538
But yeah, in Victoria introduced the climate change component and drought, right?

651
01:12:03,538 --> 01:12:10,108
And we've got we've had huge population shifts in the air and just this is just talking about the domestic component,

652
01:12:10,108 --> 01:12:16,468
the West and to the south, where they would really appreciate more access to fresh water.

653
01:12:16,468 --> 01:12:19,498
So yeah, there's lots of ideas.

654
01:12:19,498 --> 01:12:32,638
I'm really bad at like political history, but there was a presidential candidate going back to maybe the two thousand and seven.

655
01:12:32,638 --> 01:12:38,068
How would that work? Twenty eight would have been the McCain election.

656
01:12:38,068 --> 01:12:45,418
Yeah, he wasn't. He was a party like a primary candidate was the governor of New Mexico.

657
01:12:45,418 --> 01:12:54,748
I think at the time, Bill Richardson, maybe like I don't think he was anybody who made it very far in that presidential primary,

658
01:12:54,748 --> 01:13:00,418
but part of his platform that he was running on was around access to fresh water.

659
01:13:00,418 --> 01:13:04,828
And as the governor of New Mexico, right? Hey, we need water here. But yeah, it was.

660
01:13:04,828 --> 01:13:17,278
His brilliant idea was that president, I'm going to build a pipeline to service, you know, the southwest us with the Great Lakes, uh, fresh water.

661
01:13:17,278 --> 01:13:21,808
And yeah, this article also kind of talks about the modern day politics, right?

662
01:13:21,808 --> 01:13:29,218
About, uh, shifting, uh, what's the word representation with those policy shifts?

663
01:13:29,218 --> 01:13:38,848
So within with each census, which the 2020 census just concluded a little bit late because of the pandemic that we're losing,

664
01:13:38,848 --> 01:13:49,948
uh, representatives in Congress, in Michigan as our other kind of Great Lakes, border states and areas in the Sun Belt and in the,

665
01:13:49,948 --> 01:13:54,878
you know, the southwest and west are gaining representation.

666
01:13:54,878 --> 01:14:01,228
And so it might, you know, it might just be enough by congressional willpower to say, you know what?

667
01:14:01,228 --> 01:14:06,748
That's fine. And people are objecting. The majority says we should do this and we're going to do it.

668
01:14:06,748 --> 01:14:14,968
I saw a hand go up and flip on this thing where it's like when you're from, if you absolutely have, it's never like the Great Lakes.

669
01:14:14,968 --> 01:14:21,358
Obviously believe one of my friends. She's from Michigan, but she moved to Idaho for grad school and she's like,

670
01:14:21,358 --> 01:14:25,588
when she got out there, she like, I've always been really against like the Great Lakes.

671
01:14:25,588 --> 01:14:31,678
But now that I'm out here like we need water, we should take, like, what are you saying?

672
01:14:31,678 --> 01:14:36,928
Right? Yeah, no. And there's this is the tip of the iceberg. Well known as a lake.

673
01:14:36,928 --> 01:14:43,168
Um, but uh, it the demand is growing.

674
01:14:43,168 --> 01:14:47,308
Right? And uh, it's there's so much related.

675
01:14:47,308 --> 01:14:52,578
Outright, I mean, the wildfires are a huge issue, not so much in the South, but in the West.

676
01:14:52,578 --> 01:15:03,618
And you know, there's I used to show our video with like an admitted student day event.

677
01:15:03,618 --> 01:15:09,498
It was a video that the magazine Popular Science made, and it had all of these.

678
01:15:09,498 --> 01:15:16,938
It was like an animation, and it had all these icons representing different climate change related threats, right?

679
01:15:16,938 --> 01:15:26,778
Mosquitos, right for vector borne disease and how their prevalence is changing geographically within regions due to the changing climate.

680
01:15:26,778 --> 01:15:32,598
Severe weather like tornadoes. Increased frequency and strength of hurricanes.

681
01:15:32,598 --> 01:15:39,738
Coastal flooding, wildfires, you know, basically added all this stuff up, and it was kind of like blocking off parts of the US.

682
01:15:39,738 --> 01:15:45,948
And what was left was basically the state of Michigan, and it was jokingly through this animation suggesting,

683
01:15:45,948 --> 01:15:50,388
Hey, you know, I think it was looking at the year 2100 or something. We should all move to Michigan.

684
01:15:50,388 --> 01:15:55,968
And this was my silly, you know, hey, you should all come to Michigan for school.

685
01:15:55,968 --> 01:16:01,458
But yeah, I think that, you know, there's some there's some legitimate.

686
01:16:01,458 --> 01:16:11,238
I don't know if it would be a hard policy to implement. Um, but some some good rationale for slowing population shift.

687
01:16:11,238 --> 01:16:20,898
Right. And a lot of ways it doesn't make sense to kind of knowingly or even incentivize people moving from places to others.

688
01:16:20,898 --> 01:16:23,448
And it tackles all kinds of other issues, right?

689
01:16:23,448 --> 01:16:30,458
Like Will's topic on the infrastructure that you're leaving behind her management of wastewater, for example.

690
01:16:30,458 --> 01:16:34,158
Um, but yeah, that, you know, maybe you're just creating,

691
01:16:34,158 --> 01:16:39,708
you're facilitating bigger and bigger problems by kind of standing by the wayside and watching this happen.

692
01:16:39,708 --> 01:16:43,458
Anyway, thank you so much. Victoria, perfect example.

693
01:16:43,458 --> 01:16:49,428
If you guys see stuff that's just it doesn't have to be like something we just discussed in class or something you just read about,

694
01:16:49,428 --> 01:16:54,138
like environmental, health and policy is a pretty broad topic, so it's something that catches your eye.

695
01:16:54,138 --> 01:16:58,068
Don't be afraid to just shoot me a quick note and say, Hey, check this out.

696
01:16:58,068 --> 01:17:02,358
I'll say I'll do the work of making a slide. You don't have to introduce it.

697
01:17:02,358 --> 01:17:08,718
Thank you for doing it today. But if you want to put it back on me, I'm happy to kind of lead a short discussion on it.

698
01:17:08,718 --> 01:17:12,018
All right. Let's go ahead and get into a little bit of material.

699
01:17:12,018 --> 01:17:16,948
We've managed to complete use of almost all of the class period without talking about anything of substance.

700
01:17:16,948 --> 01:17:26,058
I'm joking. So and this is not comprehensive at all in terms of the readings that you've been doing,

701
01:17:26,058 --> 01:17:33,318
the talking a little bit today around environmental statutes and focusing on on four in particular.

702
01:17:33,318 --> 01:17:38,298
And then there was a separate reading from the Pew Research Center that I want.

703
01:17:38,298 --> 01:17:48,858
I have a couple of slides that we can talk about that are a bit more apply or identify challenges and or effective strategies.

704
01:17:48,858 --> 01:17:55,038
So the that we're going to step through are public health tradition here of catastrophic events,

705
01:17:55,038 --> 01:18:05,928
opportunistic conditions and then also compliments of special interests around environmental statutes.

706
01:18:05,928 --> 01:18:17,298
So when we talk about public health tradition, we're talking about the tradition, meaning that it's something that we've been doing for for decades.

707
01:18:17,298 --> 01:18:25,548
The process of conducting scientific research and part of it is actually a few steps prior,

708
01:18:25,548 --> 01:18:31,188
is actually funding that scientific research in the first place on specific

709
01:18:31,188 --> 01:18:35,598
environmental hazards and then assessing what their public health significance is.

710
01:18:35,598 --> 01:18:37,098
Right,

711
01:18:37,098 --> 01:18:50,928
that information and providing services to states that are tasked with controlling exposure or limiting exposure to those environmental hazards.

712
01:18:50,928 --> 01:18:58,398
And there's a couple of examples I have listed here. This is primarily, you know, a legislative process.

713
01:18:58,398 --> 01:19:06,138
So science informs legislation. Uh, I can talk about the Clean Air Act all day long, right?

714
01:19:06,138 --> 01:19:14,808
That's kind of my my thing is this air quality work and exposures.

715
01:19:14,808 --> 01:19:23,478
Before I do that, I'm going to I'm going to turn it over. You know, you've done some of the readings on the topic of public health tradition.

716
01:19:23,478 --> 01:19:33,148
Does anyone have a specific example that they would like to put forth that illustrates this?

717
01:19:33,148 --> 01:19:40,518
I mean, it's not necessarily just like a three letter alphabet soup of aviation like sanitation kind of goes all the way back there.

718
01:19:40,518 --> 01:19:44,958
Maybe the O.G. public of environmental protection?

719
01:19:44,958 --> 01:19:50,088
Absolutely. So this is from a historical perspective, right?

720
01:19:50,088 --> 01:19:59,418
We can go back to the broad street pump, even although that probably was poorly funded research.

721
01:19:59,418 --> 01:20:12,018
But yeah, so in effect, scientific based data and information gathering to then inform a policy process.

722
01:20:12,018 --> 01:20:20,288
So very good. Any others that come to mind. Yeah.

723
01:20:20,288 --> 01:20:22,478
Not precisely environmentally related.

724
01:20:22,478 --> 01:20:31,478
More kind of sanitation, but like immigration services and like keeping track of who has what are they organized and where they live?

725
01:20:31,478 --> 01:20:34,748
Absolutely great. Great example.

726
01:20:34,748 --> 01:20:45,638
And you know, this is going to be I'm going to step through the Clean Air Act in a minute, but this is the concept of public health tradition.

727
01:20:45,638 --> 01:20:52,718
Uh, being reliant on legislation is something that previously worked better.

728
01:20:52,718 --> 01:20:58,478
I'm not sure it ever worked well in terms of a characterization, but it used to work to some extent.

729
01:20:58,478 --> 01:21:10,358
And in more recent, uh, decades, especially a decade, it works less well in terms of successful legislation being enacted.

730
01:21:10,358 --> 01:21:11,888
So, you know, the Clean Air Act,

731
01:21:11,888 --> 01:21:28,988
and this is going back to the late 1960s and acknowledging that air quality is poor and it's harming health of many people across this country.

732
01:21:28,988 --> 01:21:35,768
And it is around this time actually with the Environmental Protection Agency was was formed as a as a federal

733
01:21:35,768 --> 01:21:44,318
government agency tasked with enforcing standards and regulations that were basically forthcoming at that point.

734
01:21:44,318 --> 01:21:46,748
And a more widespread basis.

735
01:21:46,748 --> 01:21:57,668
The Clean Air Act also was implemented in 1970, the Clean Water Act soon after the Safe Drinking Water Act as examples here on the slide.

736
01:21:57,668 --> 01:22:05,318
And then the US EPA was tasked with with regulating the standards that were imparted as part of these legislative acts.

737
01:22:05,318 --> 01:22:10,268
Those acts were informed by science, by research.

738
01:22:10,268 --> 01:22:17,438
But a huge component of the original acts wasn't that we we know what we need to know.

739
01:22:17,438 --> 01:22:25,868
It was a starting point. So a big part of those acts was actually funding both engineers also within the agency.

740
01:22:25,868 --> 01:22:35,138
But importantly, lots of extramural funding for research to continue to learn and identify where are the problems,

741
01:22:35,138 --> 01:22:41,918
what would be safe levels of contaminants in air, in water and so forth.

742
01:22:41,918 --> 01:22:46,778
And so there have been amendments to each of these acts in time that have been

743
01:22:46,778 --> 01:22:52,238
informed by the research that was funded by the original acts themselves.

744
01:22:52,238 --> 01:23:02,668
So these are all kind of examples of of this public health tradition that facilitates the formation of environmental statutes.

745
01:23:02,668 --> 01:23:05,768
Europe catastrophic events.

746
01:23:05,768 --> 01:23:18,188
So in this case, we have legislators, policymakers, decision makers and in many cases in elected positions that don't want to be approved,

747
01:23:18,188 --> 01:23:30,218
accused of of ignoring bright signs that were they were present that there could be a catastrophic event coming,

748
01:23:30,218 --> 01:23:35,108
especially if there's something that's under the control of humans.

749
01:23:35,108 --> 01:23:49,898
And so a product of of the public fearing this catastrophic event can enable legislation right by these policy makers and legislators.

750
01:23:49,898 --> 01:24:00,038
So attempting to control a potential hazard before that catastrophic event even has a chance to do a cart.

751
01:24:00,038 --> 01:24:03,758
And Palin actually was talking about this previously.

752
01:24:03,758 --> 01:24:10,628
So in effect, this is kind of the precautionary principle is not waiting until something bad happens and then reacting to it.

753
01:24:10,628 --> 01:24:14,918
It's, you know, acknowledging and being informed that it could happen.

754
01:24:14,918 --> 01:24:21,308
And so instead of waiting for it to happen, let's suppose preempted and prevented in the first place.

755
01:24:21,308 --> 01:24:26,648
What what are some examples that that come to mind with regards to environmental

756
01:24:26,648 --> 01:24:33,438
statutes or health and safety statutes around fear of catastrophic events?

757
01:24:33,438 --> 01:24:41,118
Yes, I like I don't know if it's like exactly like a vertical like reading this,

758
01:24:41,118 --> 01:24:45,758
I thought I was like to line, which was typically with like New Orleans and like that,

759
01:24:45,758 --> 01:24:57,198
like there are spots for like natural hazards that might appear that we can't predict and like other issues like earthquakes like that, for sure.

760
01:24:57,198 --> 01:24:57,868
Absolutely.

761
01:24:57,868 --> 01:25:10,878
So the having Federal Emergency Management Agency in the first place is acknowledging that these things are possibly very possibly going to happen.

762
01:25:10,878 --> 01:25:15,918
And so we're not just going to sit back and wait and then try to figure it out.

763
01:25:15,918 --> 01:25:25,718
We're going to try to do our homework and have kind of the scientific process inform how we might best mitigate those those catastrophic events.

764
01:25:25,718 --> 01:25:30,498
So, yeah, in the case of natural disasters, you know, absolutely great. Great example.

765
01:25:30,498 --> 01:25:37,638
Yeah. You know, the early 2000s, the like post-9 11, there was a lot of like bioterrorism like proportions passed,

766
01:25:37,638 --> 01:25:42,368
especially after something like anthrax something. Yeah, yeah.

767
01:25:42,368 --> 01:25:48,918
Yeah, I remember like, you're not wise about it. So that's like a really hot topic, for sure.

768
01:25:48,918 --> 01:25:57,168
For sure. Yeah. Now and it's, you know, the whole thing around September 11th that was, you know, it was a single day,

769
01:25:57,168 --> 01:26:10,608
2000 one year old, you know, too young to remember this, but just around flying right and restrictions now to fly.

770
01:26:10,608 --> 01:26:19,248
I actually was on a flight from Seattle to Detroit that landed in the early morning hours of September 10, 2001.

771
01:26:19,248 --> 01:26:28,818
And you know, then you could go with a friend or family member to the airport you had to walk through like

772
01:26:28,818 --> 01:26:32,808
a metal detector to make sure you weren't bringing anything like weapons or something,

773
01:26:32,808 --> 01:26:41,478
but otherwise you could go to the gate with them. Wait until their flight ready to leave, you know, give a good goodbye hug.

774
01:26:41,478 --> 01:26:45,348
See you later. You know, and then after the flight,

775
01:26:45,348 --> 01:26:48,348
if you wanted to wait to make sure their flight took off or whatever or they

776
01:26:48,348 --> 01:26:53,268
were delayed or you're hanging out with them like you could do these things,

777
01:26:53,268 --> 01:26:58,098
you don't have to take off any shoes, right? You didn't have to limit your liquids.

778
01:26:58,098 --> 01:27:02,748
And so, yeah, so you gave a really great example around bioterrorism.

779
01:27:02,748 --> 01:27:10,998
But this this single event triggered so many events right now based on prevention,

780
01:27:10,998 --> 01:27:19,038
and it was there was studying the issue and identifying, Okay, this happened.

781
01:27:19,038 --> 01:27:25,398
What other things along these lines could now happen, even tangentially related?

782
01:27:25,398 --> 01:27:32,188
And what protective measures and regulations and policies can we put in place to prevent them?

783
01:27:32,188 --> 01:27:36,498
You know, those catastrophic things from happening in the first place? Great example.

784
01:27:36,498 --> 01:27:43,488
This is kind of, do you know, one smoking on planes with bad fact that you should know or no, I don't.

785
01:27:43,488 --> 01:27:51,768
I don't. It didn't have much to do with September 11th. Fortunately, there was a very good other data to support.

786
01:27:51,768 --> 01:28:01,308
We implemented that policy. It was it was less from from a health standpoint.

787
01:28:01,308 --> 01:28:04,698
It was more from a safety standard for the fear of fires, right?

788
01:28:04,698 --> 01:28:14,468
Fires on an airplane are generally not good. I think that was the original bigger driver versus, you know, secondhand smoke exposure or something.

789
01:28:14,468 --> 01:28:24,008
Yes, and I was thinking, too, about like gun violence and like gun policy that's supposed to be impacting that.

790
01:28:24,008 --> 01:28:30,128
And I guess it's an example of something where maybe the fear hasn't been successful in pushing through effective policies.

791
01:28:30,128 --> 01:28:32,048
Yes, I know in another year, of course,

792
01:28:32,048 --> 01:28:38,378
we talked about how like agenda setting differs immediately following mass shooting events versus what happens actually,

793
01:28:38,378 --> 01:28:44,438
like a few months out or like a year out after the fear sort of like subsides immediately in the community.

794
01:28:44,438 --> 01:28:48,138
That's active. Yeah, great. Great example.

795
01:28:48,138 --> 01:28:57,368
And it's, you know, it's so tempting in my own mind, just because we're living in this moment to have examples that are pandemic related come to mind.

796
01:28:57,368 --> 01:29:04,058
Right. And this is a little bit of what I uh, you know, how I interpret.

797
01:29:04,058 --> 01:29:07,868
I guess it's I mean, I think it's fair to call it a catastrophic event, right?

798
01:29:07,868 --> 01:29:20,888
An emerging global pandemic. Um, there was a reasonable amount of fear, right, that that people felt and realized and that informed their actions.

799
01:29:20,888 --> 01:29:32,018
It also helped to form policies that were put in place at very different levels of government governance.

800
01:29:32,018 --> 01:29:34,538
And you could make the case, you know, months.

801
01:29:34,538 --> 01:29:40,418
In this case, you know, two years down the road we were talking about, you know, the sharing experiences here on campus,

802
01:29:40,418 --> 01:29:54,828
how the fear, the residual fear is, you know, I think understandably or arguably much less than what it was two years ago.

803
01:29:54,828 --> 01:30:02,808
Which is which is the challenge to the present day policy enactment and the limitation, for sure.

804
01:30:02,808 --> 01:30:14,488
And the other examples on this one. OK, opportunistic conditions.

805
01:30:14,488 --> 01:30:24,088
So this one we're talking about legislation occurs simply because the conditions were opportune.

806
01:30:24,088 --> 01:30:31,378
So there's been cases where attaching legislation to an existing body of amendments

807
01:30:31,378 --> 01:30:38,428
that were already under consideration allows something to be passed and implemented.

808
01:30:38,428 --> 01:30:59,088
So this one has very much again a legislative basis to it. Are there other examples that came to folks mind or from the readings?

809
01:30:59,088 --> 01:31:02,388
So, yeah, there was a couple on this line, right?

810
01:31:02,388 --> 01:31:14,298
Supply, so the emergency response a community right to know component of supply was one the Toxics Release inventory,

811
01:31:14,298 --> 01:31:22,128
which is which is a huge amount of public disclosure of the amount of contaminants

812
01:31:22,128 --> 01:31:28,998
that are emitted from from known industries and facilities and so forth,

813
01:31:28,998 --> 01:31:35,358
where alone. They didn't really have a whole lot of support.

814
01:31:35,358 --> 01:31:43,578
Right. And just, you know, passing them as a standalone, there was a lot of work to do and they weren't likely to go through.

815
01:31:43,578 --> 01:31:53,178
But there was an existing body of legislation that was, you know, perhaps just a couple of votes short and in order to get those couple of votes.

816
01:31:53,178 --> 01:32:03,468
Somebody said, Yeah, I'm willing to to support this whole piece of legislation, if you would add this toxic release inventory to it.

817
01:32:03,468 --> 01:32:09,198
And so that would be an example of kind of an opportunistic condition.

818
01:32:09,198 --> 01:32:23,178
And this is, uh, for benefit and detriment, a policy that's still, or I guess, a mechanism that's still still utilized.

819
01:32:23,178 --> 01:32:29,598
The fourth one here is keeping track of the time, a confluence of special interests,

820
01:32:29,598 --> 01:32:37,188
and on the surface, a lot of these might sound or look similar, but they're actually quite different.

821
01:32:37,188 --> 01:32:40,638
So if we're talking domestically here and in many of these examples,

822
01:32:40,638 --> 01:32:47,568
so a political consequence of the separation of power where we have different controlling parties, right?

823
01:32:47,568 --> 01:33:00,288
Either in Congress, in the White House. So the different branches of government in the US and the inherent necessity for in space,

824
01:33:00,288 --> 01:33:07,818
for negotiation and compromise in order to actually accomplish successful legislation.

825
01:33:07,818 --> 01:33:17,028
So in this sense, the confluence of special interests can assist in the legislative process.

826
01:33:17,028 --> 01:33:29,608
So what are what are examples that folks can bring on this one?

827
01:33:29,608 --> 01:33:36,928
I mean, honestly, the bipartisan infrastructure bill, kind of a couple of special interests in terms of like everyone,

828
01:33:36,928 --> 01:33:39,928
no matter what party, you are a lot of spending in your home district.

829
01:33:39,928 --> 01:33:46,348
And so after two years of infrastructure, a weaker and the real lines like everyone wanted to bring home the projects.

830
01:33:46,348 --> 01:33:52,888
But then also trade associations love the steel workers love if this is something that worked.

831
01:33:52,888 --> 01:34:07,018
Sure. Yeah. And I guess, you know, acknowledging as kind of the the caveat or the preface to that is a larger or broader scope,

832
01:34:07,018 --> 01:34:11,278
you know, wasn't right, wasn't able to be supported.

833
01:34:11,278 --> 01:34:17,248
And so through kind of negotiation and compromise, a smaller but yet still, you know,

834
01:34:17,248 --> 01:34:22,828
very important and impactful piece of legislation was able to be passed as as a result of that process.

835
01:34:22,828 --> 01:34:33,718
Yeah, it's a great example. Many others.

836
01:34:33,718 --> 01:34:50,108
All right. Any questions on any of these that we've discussed kind of mechanisms in the silica environmental statutes?

837
01:34:50,108 --> 01:34:55,778
OK. In the remaining amount of time, I don't think we'll be able to go through all of this.

838
01:34:55,778 --> 01:35:00,968
Please check out this. This is one of the readings. It's not much.

839
01:35:00,968 --> 01:35:12,158
It's actually in an interview with a with a researcher entitled and Gave Me with a range of stakeholders can lead to environmental health solutions.

840
01:35:12,158 --> 01:35:18,968
And this researcher discussing how cross-sector collaborations boost health equity and

841
01:35:18,968 --> 01:35:25,058
there are a number of questions posed and then some answers given in the time we have.

842
01:35:25,058 --> 01:35:29,678
We can get you a couple of these and kind of discuss them, but probably not all of them.

843
01:35:29,678 --> 01:35:39,368
So one of the questions was what are some of the first steps for communities facing public health issues?

844
01:35:39,368 --> 01:35:44,198
And the answer provided is in each of the cases in the book,

845
01:35:44,198 --> 01:35:50,978
community members identified in environmental public health problem and sought help from government professionals,

846
01:35:50,978 --> 01:35:57,728
academics and or non-governmental organizations to understand what was driving the problem,

847
01:35:57,728 --> 01:36:04,058
who it was affecting and what gaps and policies and programs allowed it to continue

848
01:36:04,058 --> 01:36:11,528
so effectively addressing the gaps required change in policy systems or environments,

849
01:36:11,528 --> 01:36:18,068
and working together to reframe a longstanding environmental health problem as an equity issue

850
01:36:18,068 --> 01:36:23,948
brought new stakeholders to the table who provided the energy needed to develop a new approach.

851
01:36:23,948 --> 01:36:32,168
So there was an iterative process of increasing understanding of the problem and bringing in new stakeholders to come up with solutions.

852
01:36:32,168 --> 01:36:38,768
So the article was framed around real problems in communities, right?

853
01:36:38,768 --> 01:36:47,738
And there is a lot of history that a top down approach of implementation simply isn't effective.

854
01:36:47,738 --> 01:36:52,778
In many cases, it misses the mark. Right? We thought this was the problem.

855
01:36:52,778 --> 01:36:56,828
We implemented this policy, but we in the end,

856
01:36:56,828 --> 01:37:06,458
we learned that we kind of provided a solution to a problem that didn't exist and or we didn't provide a solution to the problem that truly exists.

857
01:37:06,458 --> 01:37:18,568
And so the article and the research here is is speaking to ways to engage stakeholders that these multiple levels.

858
01:37:18,568 --> 01:37:28,808
Right. So it's not just government, it's not just academia. It's community based organizations that can serve as a true voice for communities.

859
01:37:28,808 --> 01:37:33,668
And so talking about this iterative process? OK, who?

860
01:37:33,668 --> 01:37:41,798
Whoever is, you know, kind of organizing this in the first place can maybe say, we think this is the problem, but give us some feedback.

861
01:37:41,798 --> 01:37:46,658
Are we are we do we have this prioritized correctly? Is this accurate?

862
01:37:46,658 --> 01:37:58,718
And through that iteration, the view and the definition of the problem can be refined and more accurately addressed.

863
01:37:58,718 --> 01:38:08,648
And in the end, you provide a better result in terms of a policy framework, tackle one more.

864
01:38:08,648 --> 01:38:15,878
So, you know, a lot of this is is not there's not so much offering or recipe book for it.

865
01:38:15,878 --> 01:38:18,728
This is the way to achieve all the solutions.

866
01:38:18,728 --> 01:38:26,588
Probably the biggest result from some work along these lines is highlighting where the where the challenges are right,

867
01:38:26,588 --> 01:38:31,028
and at least you're giving yourself a chance that you can identify where the challenges are,

868
01:38:31,028 --> 01:38:36,578
then you know what needs to be addressed in order to have a chance of success.

869
01:38:36,578 --> 01:38:43,388
So the question on this line? What are some of the key challenges in advancing cross-sector collaboration?

870
01:38:43,388 --> 01:38:48,008
And how did the communities highlighted in this book tackle that?

871
01:38:48,008 --> 01:38:53,978
And so, you know, talking about public health professionals for the most part in this area.

872
01:38:53,978 --> 01:38:59,468
People recognize the importance of collaboration and being able to promote health equity objectives.

873
01:38:59,468 --> 01:39:04,628
But the reality of sustaining impactful collaborations is really challenging.

874
01:39:04,628 --> 01:39:07,808
And I can share some kind of personal examples here in a minute,

875
01:39:07,808 --> 01:39:12,968
but it's talking about how it's hard to find dedicated funding to bring people together

876
01:39:12,968 --> 01:39:20,498
and support their work outside of the scope of their home institution where they reside.

877
01:39:20,498 --> 01:39:27,638
Resource limited institutions might not even have the time to devote to to a collaboration.

878
01:39:27,638 --> 01:39:34,328
Sounds great. But you know what I'm up to here in my own work, I can't take anything else out.

879
01:39:34,328 --> 01:39:43,298
There might also be internal barriers such as staff incentives, training cultures and kind of just conflicting objectives of organizations.

880
01:39:43,298 --> 01:39:49,538
And the point here is that overcoming all of these challenges doesn't just happen by.

881
01:39:49,538 --> 01:39:58,568
Chance, it takes a lot of energy and commitment and perseverance and persistence in each of the initiatives examined here.

882
01:39:58,568 --> 01:40:03,248
There was at least one party with mission driven to promote partnerships,

883
01:40:03,248 --> 01:40:10,208
and that dedicated capacity was modest but essential to finding and leveraging support from diverse sources

884
01:40:10,208 --> 01:40:14,738
so that the really quick one here before we wrap up that I'll share from my own personal experiences.

885
01:40:14,738 --> 01:40:19,568
When I kind of gave my introduction my self introduction, I talked about the research that I've done.

886
01:40:19,568 --> 01:40:24,638
It's been community based, participatory research, right?

887
01:40:24,638 --> 01:40:29,558
Sounds great. You're writing the grant proposal. We're going to engage everyone in the community.

888
01:40:29,558 --> 01:40:33,278
They're all going to be involved. It's going to be perfect, right?

889
01:40:33,278 --> 01:40:41,648
Where are the resources for to allow representatives and stakeholders in the community to come

890
01:40:41,648 --> 01:40:48,458
and sit at this table to help identify what are the high priority environmental health issues?

891
01:40:48,458 --> 01:40:52,118
Which one should be addressed and what's the best way to do it right?

892
01:40:52,118 --> 01:40:59,408
There needs to be real resources associated with it in order for that to even have a chance of happening.

893
01:40:59,408 --> 01:41:04,268
This article goes on and talks about give some examples of, uh,

894
01:41:04,268 --> 01:41:11,438
a National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences grant mechanism, which basically did exactly that.

895
01:41:11,438 --> 01:41:21,518
And this was this was a huge hurdle to overcome NIH institutes and now specifically just funded research, right?

896
01:41:21,518 --> 01:41:30,908
It wasn't allowable to put in funds in your research grant proposal to pay community stakeholders to attend,

897
01:41:30,908 --> 01:41:37,628
right to host an event to pay for space, whatever it is, that's not research.

898
01:41:37,628 --> 01:41:47,378
And it took about probably a solid decade of people that do community based participatory research work to convince needs that you know what,

899
01:41:47,378 --> 01:41:56,228
if you want the best and most, not just the best research, but the most impactful research with the biggest benefits to actual communities.

900
01:41:56,228 --> 01:42:03,368
This has to happen, and it did start to happen. So it was both a challenge, but then a little bit of a success story.

901
01:42:03,368 --> 01:42:07,058
Of course, there's never enough resources. There's always more needed.

902
01:42:07,058 --> 01:42:15,968
But at least it became a real way for NIH institutes to actually find the projects to support this type of stakeholder engagement.

903
01:42:15,968 --> 01:42:24,818
I think we are pretty much at yes, we were at the end of class. Any questions before we part?

904
01:42:24,818 --> 01:42:30,398
All right. Thanks again, you guys so much from the earlier class discussion, I really, really appreciate it.

905
01:42:30,398 --> 01:42:38,348
I will absolutely take that feedback back to others and hopefully some of it can be addressed.

906
01:42:38,348 --> 01:42:48,708
Have a great afternoon.
