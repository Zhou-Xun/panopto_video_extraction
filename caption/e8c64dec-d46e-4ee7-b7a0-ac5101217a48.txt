1
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:10,279
In today's session of HMP600, The Health Services System,

2
00:00:10,279 --> 00:00:14,040
we will be talking about drug pricing in the US.

3
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,967
So today we will look at and identify and

4
00:00:17,967 --> 00:00:23,930
define different mechanisms used to price drugs in the US.

5
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:30,102
We'll describe the various entities who are part of the drug distribution and

6
00:00:30,102 --> 00:00:34,965
reimbursement system in the US and will evaluate how this drug

7
00:00:34,965 --> 00:00:39,642
distribution and reimbursement system affects prices and

8
00:00:39,642 --> 00:00:43,411
spending on drugs in the US health care system.

9
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:51,669
So this graph shows the change in the price index for

10
00:00:51,669 --> 00:00:58,506
prescription drug prices, brand names in the red color,

11
00:00:58,506 --> 00:01:04,367
generic drugs in the blue compared to a collection

12
00:01:04,367 --> 00:01:11,622
of commonly used household goods and the changes in prices for

13
00:01:11,622 --> 00:01:16,820
those goods over the same five year period.

14
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:20,651
So you can see that the sort of list price for

15
00:01:20,651 --> 00:01:25,441
brand name drugs in the US has gone up substantially,

16
00:01:25,441 --> 00:01:30,250
has increased substantially in the last five years.

17
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:34,629
While somewhat surprisingly, the generic drug

18
00:01:34,629 --> 00:01:39,560
prices have actually declined over this same period.

19
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:47,828
And we see that the prices of household goods have risen about 7% overall.

20
00:01:47,828 --> 00:01:55,249
So today what we're gonna do is look at what the price is in drug pricing and

21
00:01:55,249 --> 00:02:00,996
of course there are [LAUGH] like elsewhere in healthcare,

22
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:05,083
where we may not even use the term price.

23
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:08,094
We talk about charges and reimbursements.

24
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:14,316
In pharmaceuticals we actually can see that there are multiple prices for

25
00:02:14,316 --> 00:02:19,536
drugs based on different mechanisms, different benchmarks

26
00:02:19,536 --> 00:02:24,354
used depending on the transactions across the different

27
00:02:24,354 --> 00:02:29,695
entities in the drug distribution and reimbursement system.

28
00:02:29,695 --> 00:02:34,921
Now in some ways, other industries also have multiple prices.

29
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:39,310
So consider the automobile in industry, for example.

30
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:43,718
So, we might talk about an invoice price and

31
00:02:43,718 --> 00:02:49,555
the invoice price is what the car dealer, the retailer for

32
00:02:49,555 --> 00:02:55,530
cars pays to the manufacturer to get the car to the lot.

33
00:02:55,530 --> 00:03:01,507
Invoice prices are private information between the car manufacturer and

34
00:03:01,507 --> 00:03:02,870
the car dealer.

35
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:09,740
Second, we have the manufacturer's suggested price.

36
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:16,372
This is sometimes also called a list price and this is what the manufacturer of

37
00:03:16,372 --> 00:03:21,800
the car suggests to the car dealer as the price for the vehicle.

38
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:27,484
This is public information and it is a universally listed price for

39
00:03:27,484 --> 00:03:31,230
that vehicle that anyone can look at.

40
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:36,483
Now, the car dealer, the retailer for the car will take this

41
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:42,354
information when they get the car and they will set a sticker price,

42
00:03:42,354 --> 00:03:47,730
which is the price the car dealer offers the car to consumers.

43
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:52,727
The advertised price, sometimes it's also called.

44
00:03:52,727 --> 00:03:57,409
And then for cars, we actually could identify 1/4 price,

45
00:03:57,409 --> 00:03:59,669
which is the purchase price.

46
00:03:59,669 --> 00:04:03,367
What the consumer actually pays for the car,

47
00:04:03,367 --> 00:04:09,302
which is typically negotiated between the consumer and the car dealer,

48
00:04:09,302 --> 00:04:15,528
drawing from the sticker price and negotiating some final purchase price,

49
00:04:15,528 --> 00:04:19,631
which is typically lower than the sticker price.

50
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:26,524
We can also even think about this in, say, the retail clothing

51
00:04:26,524 --> 00:04:31,921
industry where we might identify similarly an invoice price

52
00:04:31,921 --> 00:04:37,314
with the retailer, like a large retailer, like a Macy's or

53
00:04:37,314 --> 00:04:42,312
a Walmart will pay to the manufacturer of the clothing.

54
00:04:42,312 --> 00:04:45,962
That will lead to a sales price,

55
00:04:45,962 --> 00:04:52,600
which is the tagged price for an item sold at the retailer.

56
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:58,333
That sales price might be somewhat similar to the manufacturer's suggested price,

57
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:02,631
although the same item might have very different sales prices at

58
00:05:02,631 --> 00:05:04,250
different retailers.

59
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:10,610
The retailer then might also mark down the sales price.

60
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:16,620
They put it on sale for some reduction in the sales price.

61
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:22,458
The purchase price then that the consumer pays, is the sales price multiplied

62
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:27,880
by any, say percentage reduction or markdown that the retailer makes.

63
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:32,398
You can see a difference in the purchase price in the clothing industry is gonna be

64
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:35,863
very different from the purchase price in the auto industry.

65
00:05:35,863 --> 00:05:42,185
Because the consumer is not negotiating the price at all with the retailer,

66
00:05:42,185 --> 00:05:47,321
though, the consumer may rely on seeing the markdown that any

67
00:05:47,321 --> 00:05:52,381
particular retailer might make to the sales price, right?

68
00:05:52,381 --> 00:05:57,601
So these are different prices that we could talk about and

69
00:05:57,601 --> 00:06:00,872
compare in different industries.

70
00:06:00,872 --> 00:06:04,041
What about the price for drugs in the US?

71
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:10,364
And here, I'm gonna be talking about the drug pricing for

72
00:06:10,364 --> 00:06:14,752
drugs sold in pharmacies to patients for

73
00:06:14,752 --> 00:06:19,420
patient administered outpatient drugs.

74
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:25,671
So not those that would be administered in a hospital or in a clinic setting.

75
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:33,952
First, the first price we could talk about in the drug distribution and

76
00:06:33,952 --> 00:06:39,568
reimbursement system is the wholesale acquisition cost price,

77
00:06:39,568 --> 00:06:42,860
often referred to as the whack price.

78
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:48,289
This is published by the drug manufacturers for

79
00:06:48,289 --> 00:06:54,005
sale to wholesalers or via a wholesaler of drugs.

80
00:06:54,005 --> 00:06:57,855
You've probably heard of some of the largest drug wholesalers.

81
00:06:57,855 --> 00:07:05,367
McKesson, AmerisourceBergen and Cardinal Health are some of the largest ones.

82
00:07:05,367 --> 00:07:11,081
And so, this is the price used to benchmark

83
00:07:11,081 --> 00:07:15,390
pharmacy purchasing of drugs.

84
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:19,451
It is sort of similar to the invoice price for cars.

85
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:30,118
So consider a large pharmaceutical manufacturer such as Lilly for

86
00:07:30,118 --> 00:07:35,930
example, Lilly manufacturers the Cymbalta tablet.

87
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:40,885
So if Lilly will sell the Cymbalta tablet

88
00:07:40,885 --> 00:07:45,839
to a wholesaler based on this WAC price,

89
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:49,629
the wholesaler then stocks and

90
00:07:49,629 --> 00:07:54,610
deliver Cymbalta to a retail pharmacy.

91
00:07:54,610 --> 00:08:00,896
And the pharmacy will purchase that from the wholesaler

92
00:08:00,896 --> 00:08:06,915
based on the WAC price plus typically some markup that

93
00:08:06,915 --> 00:08:12,011
the wholesaler will charge to the pharmacy.

94
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:20,797
A second type of price we can talk about in the drug distribution system,

95
00:08:20,797 --> 00:08:23,620
is the average wholesale part price.

96
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:27,855
So this price is the AWP is

97
00:08:27,855 --> 00:08:33,120
identified by third parties.

98
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,818
Third party data aggregators who look at the wholesale

99
00:08:37,818 --> 00:08:41,291
prices across multiple wholesalers and

100
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:46,215
then they published this average wholesale sale price.

101
00:08:46,215 --> 00:08:49,155
This becomes a public price.

102
00:08:49,155 --> 00:08:56,638
And this is what many payers will base their drug reimbursements to a pharmacy on

103
00:08:56,638 --> 00:09:02,780
based on the average wholesale price that they are expecting that

104
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:08,266
the pharmacy is paying the wholesaler to stock the drugs.

105
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:16,220
So this is similar to a list price or the retail tag price or

106
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:20,511
sticker price in other industries.

107
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:27,753
A third type of price that we can talk about in the drug industry

108
00:09:27,753 --> 00:09:32,682
is the maximum allowable cost price, the MAC price.

109
00:09:32,682 --> 00:09:36,806
So this applies to generic drugs.

110
00:09:36,806 --> 00:09:41,168
So generic drugs by definition are drugs that can be

111
00:09:41,168 --> 00:09:44,940
manufactured by multiple manufacturers.

112
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,750
So, they're multi source generic drugs.

113
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:53,494
And the MAC price is the price that the payer is an insurer or

114
00:09:53,494 --> 00:09:57,970
a pharmacy benefit manager will determine.

115
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:02,792
And so, they look at the multiple manufacturers of generics who

116
00:10:02,792 --> 00:10:05,490
have different published prices.

117
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:08,119
The payers don't want the pharmacy

118
00:10:08,119 --> 00:10:12,773
to purposely choose the most expensive generic on the market.

119
00:10:12,773 --> 00:10:17,376
So the payers calculate a price based on looking at

120
00:10:17,376 --> 00:10:22,749
the published prices of the manufacturers of generics and

121
00:10:22,749 --> 00:10:27,920
they establish their own often proprietary MAC price.

122
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,310
That is what they then pay to the pharmacies for

123
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:36,927
generic drugs, no matter which manufacturer,

124
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:41,891
the pharmacy might be purchasing those drugs from.

125
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:51,500
Another type of price we can identify is the average manufacturer's price.

126
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:57,590
This price was established as part of the omnibus budget budget.

127
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:04,284
The OBRA, I'm forgetting what they are is,

128
00:11:04,284 --> 00:11:10,458
in 1990 the federal budget process.

129
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:15,565
And the AMP is the average price paid to the manufacturer for

130
00:11:15,565 --> 00:11:20,281
the drug in the United States by wholesalers, right?

131
00:11:20,281 --> 00:11:25,538
So it is thinking about that average

132
00:11:25,538 --> 00:11:31,340
wholesale price that was set earlier.

133
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:36,440
But then this is actually trying to establish what it is

134
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:43,800
that the manufacturer is actually charging in the whack to those manufacturers.

135
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:47,958
So it is a retro effectively calculated price.

136
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:51,360
That is calculated actually by CMS.

137
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,890
And is proprietary information held by CMS.

138
00:11:54,890 --> 00:12:00,076
And in some ways it's the purpose is so that Medicaid through

139
00:12:00,076 --> 00:12:05,058
the federal government, even though Medicaid is state,

140
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:12,810
given that many all state Medicaid budgets are partially coming from federal sources.

141
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:20,573
The average manufacturer price is to ensure that that Medicaid and

142
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:26,674
the federal government through Medicaid is never

143
00:12:26,674 --> 00:12:31,802
paying a higher price than what is available

144
00:12:31,802 --> 00:12:36,820
through the average wholesale prices in.

145
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:41,361
So this was after this was calculated began to be

146
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:46,490
calculated in in way back from 1990 in 2006.

147
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:47,201
The A.

148
00:12:47,201 --> 00:12:47,731
M. P.

149
00:12:47,731 --> 00:12:53,624
Was made available to state Medicaid programs monthly to ensure that

150
00:12:53,624 --> 00:12:59,631
those programs were not over paying for drugs paid for by Medicaid.

151
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:01,761
And the A.

152
00:13:01,761 --> 00:13:02,401
C. A.

153
00:13:02,401 --> 00:13:08,000
Actually built on this average manufacturer price.

154
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,661
And so the A.

155
00:13:09,661 --> 00:13:10,341
M. P.

156
00:13:10,341 --> 00:13:14,520
Helps determine the federal upper limit price.

157
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:18,620
Yet another price that is now part of the Affordable Care Act.

158
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:23,228
And it is basically defines what federal

159
00:13:23,228 --> 00:13:28,647
Medicaid will pay into state Medicaid programs

160
00:13:28,647 --> 00:13:33,680
as the upper limit for for generic drugs.

161
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:38,666
And it is to prevent over reimburse rover reimbursing when

162
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:41,931
a cheaper alternative is available.

163
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:49,873
And you know another example of this or

164
00:13:49,873 --> 00:13:56,031
a building on what has been done for generics through the A.

165
00:13:56,031 --> 00:13:56,960
M. P.

166
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,541
And the federal upper limit prices.

167
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,670
We now also have yet another price.

168
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:09,620
This is the national average drug acquisition cost price.

169
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,721
And this is C.

170
00:14:11,721 --> 00:14:16,793
M. S. Publishing a benchmark through a national

171
00:14:16,793 --> 00:14:21,902
survey of the the prices that retail pharmacies

172
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:26,910
are paying to wholesalers for brand name drugs.

173
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:32,806
And so some states started specifying this benchmark

174
00:14:32,806 --> 00:14:38,583
through these surveys within their own states again so

175
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:42,914
that Medicaid was not paying more than what

176
00:14:42,914 --> 00:14:49,150
the pharmacy was paying for the price to wholesalers.

177
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:51,986
So today many Medicaid programs,

178
00:14:51,986 --> 00:14:57,074
state Medicaid programs are considering using this national

179
00:14:57,074 --> 00:15:03,173
average drug acquisition cost price as a benchmark for brand name drugs.

180
00:15:03,173 --> 00:15:07,835
And states that implement this benchmark,

181
00:15:07,835 --> 00:15:16,540
will likely increase their dispensing fee via Medicaid through this mechanism.

182
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:21,520
And Michigan actually implemented

183
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:25,836
the Medak price in 2017 for

184
00:15:25,836 --> 00:15:32,147
all covered outpatient drugs via Medicaid.

185
00:15:32,147 --> 00:15:36,707
So we've talked about six different prices for

186
00:15:36,707 --> 00:15:40,925
drugs in the US that are sold in pharmacies.

187
00:15:40,925 --> 00:15:45,598
The whack price which is similar to the invoice price,

188
00:15:45,598 --> 00:15:52,210
the AWP the Average Wholesale Price is sort of like the suggested list price.

189
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:56,445
We have the Mac price, which is what payers,

190
00:15:56,445 --> 00:16:00,020
third party payers set for generics.

191
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:04,322
We have the average manufacturer price which is

192
00:16:04,322 --> 00:16:08,090
a price that Medicaid pays for generics.

193
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:15,742
The ACA Established the federal upper limit price for Medicaid to pay.

194
00:16:15,742 --> 00:16:25,389
And now the this National Average Drug Acquisition Cost Price is used

195
00:16:25,389 --> 00:16:32,540
by some Medicaid programs including in Michigan,

196
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:38,876
for Medicaid payment for non generic drugs.

197
00:16:38,876 --> 00:16:45,252
All right, so why do we have so many different prices for drugs in the US?

198
00:16:45,252 --> 00:16:51,290
And the answer is because of the drug distribution and reimbursement system.

199
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:56,082
And so surprise surprise the US Drug Distribution and

200
00:16:56,082 --> 00:16:59,712
Reimbursement System is very complex.

201
00:16:59,712 --> 00:17:06,624
With lots of different entities, lots of different types of transactions and

202
00:17:06,624 --> 00:17:11,346
contracts leading to all of these different prices.

203
00:17:11,346 --> 00:17:15,866
So let's take a look at this drug distribution and reimbursement system.

204
00:17:17,996 --> 00:17:21,010
So this is a simplified version.

205
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:25,152
That is in some ways not surprising to you,

206
00:17:25,152 --> 00:17:32,540
when we think about our third party payment system for healthcare in the US.

207
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:36,403
So, we have parties one and two.

208
00:17:36,403 --> 00:17:43,791
The patient, party one going to the pharmacy who is the health provider.

209
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:47,496
The pharmacy and the pharmacist in this case,

210
00:17:47,496 --> 00:17:51,394
dispensing prescription drugs to the patient.

211
00:17:51,394 --> 00:17:55,656
We of course have party three who is the payer,

212
00:17:55,656 --> 00:17:59,482
the third party payer, the health plan,

213
00:17:59,482 --> 00:18:04,640
the private insurer, the Medicaid or Medicare payer.

214
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,438
And for outpatient drugs that is typically

215
00:18:09,438 --> 00:18:13,842
Medicaid, even for people over 65.

216
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:17,639
Because Medicare does not pay for

217
00:18:17,639 --> 00:18:21,979
drugs outpatient drugs initially and

218
00:18:21,979 --> 00:18:29,444
we have now the pharmaceutical drug benefit as part of Medicare.

219
00:18:29,444 --> 00:18:32,067
So we'll kind of look at that a little bit.

220
00:18:32,067 --> 00:18:35,323
And in addition to these three parties,

221
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:40,593
we also have the manufacturers, the pharmaceutical industry,

222
00:18:40,593 --> 00:18:45,410
the pharmaceutical manufacturers who produce the drugs.

223
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:50,158
And as if these four parties weren't complicated enough as in

224
00:18:50,158 --> 00:18:54,085
the rest of healthcare, the drug distribution and

225
00:18:54,085 --> 00:18:58,670
reimbursement system is actually even more complicated.

226
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:03,321
And this is the full picture, of this system and

227
00:19:03,321 --> 00:19:07,159
this is for just for outpatient drugs,

228
00:19:07,159 --> 00:19:12,180
dispersed through a retail pharmacy to a patient.

229
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:17,318
So now we're gonna go through this different system

230
00:19:17,318 --> 00:19:23,749
to identify these different entities, that make up the system.

231
00:19:23,749 --> 00:19:29,889
And these different flows of products of financial payments and

232
00:19:29,889 --> 00:19:36,720
contracts between the different entities who are part of this system.

233
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:41,772
Are what is responsible for all of those different

234
00:19:41,772 --> 00:19:46,463
prices that we see in the drug distribution and

235
00:19:46,463 --> 00:19:50,510
reimbursement system in the US.

236
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:56,150
Okay, let's start with retail pharmacies in this system.

237
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:59,523
So what is the pharmacy role?

238
00:19:59,523 --> 00:20:05,554
The pharmacy obtains drugs from drug wholesalers

239
00:20:05,554 --> 00:20:11,451
that are based on the WAC price plus some markup.

240
00:20:11,451 --> 00:20:16,745
So the wholesaler is selling directly to

241
00:20:16,745 --> 00:20:24,080
retail pharmacies at the whack price plus some markup.

242
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:29,004
Or in some ways the pharmacies might be purchasing via,

243
00:20:29,004 --> 00:20:35,082
not a direct relationship between the wholesaler to the pharmacy but

244
00:20:35,082 --> 00:20:40,341
through what's called a group purchasing organization.

245
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:50,818
In addition the pharmacies may contract with a pharmacy benefit manager or

246
00:20:50,818 --> 00:20:54,709
and or with a third party payer at for

247
00:20:54,709 --> 00:20:59,020
predetermined reimbursement rates.

248
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:06,528
And those rates would be based on the average wholesale price for

249
00:21:06,528 --> 00:21:11,115
brand name drugs or on the mac prices for

250
00:21:11,115 --> 00:21:15,441
generics that are set by the payers.

251
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:22,985
Again, the retail pharmacies may be working through a privacy benefit,

252
00:21:22,985 --> 00:21:27,900
pharmacy benefits manager through a third party payer.

253
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:31,402
Or they may be operating through a pharmacy

254
00:21:31,402 --> 00:21:34,920
services administration organization.

255
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,401
Yet another entity in this system.

256
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:45,470
The pharmacies may also contract directly with the drug manufacturer for

257
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:51,970
some kind of negotiated discount or rebate on the price of the drugs that they stock.

258
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:54,910
And then of course the pharmacy is

259
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:59,540
dispensing the drugs to patients for some payment.

260
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:04,930
And the payment might be a complete cash payment for

261
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:08,000
the total cost of the drug.

262
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,082
It might be the copayment or

263
00:22:10,082 --> 00:22:15,431
coinsurance if that patient has a health plan from a 3rd party payer.

264
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:20,090
So that's the role of the pharmacy.

265
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:20,851
Okay.

266
00:22:20,851 --> 00:22:24,491
So what about this drug wholesaler?

267
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:30,516
The drug wholesaler is purchasing the drugs

268
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:35,689
from the drug manufacturer via the wack price,

269
00:22:35,689 --> 00:22:40,800
the wholesale acquisition cost price.

270
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:44,627
The drug wholesaler then distributes the drugs to

271
00:22:44,627 --> 00:22:48,470
the pharmacies based on a whack plus some markup.

272
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:54,230
And this is pricing agreements directly with the pharmacies as we just discussed.

273
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:59,922
Or it might be through agreements that are negotiated

274
00:22:59,922 --> 00:23:07,521
with those group purchasing organizations and you can see those here.

275
00:23:07,521 --> 00:23:10,890
The wholesaler is purchasing from the manufacturer.

276
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:15,300
The wholesaler is selling and contracting directly with the pharmacies.

277
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:19,914
The wholesaler might also be working through a group purchasing

278
00:23:19,914 --> 00:23:24,021
organization between the wholesaler and the pharmacy.

279
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:26,080
Okay.

280
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,260
Who's next in this entity?

281
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:33,211
The third party payers, what is their role?

282
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:39,139
The 3rd Party payers of course are providing a drug

283
00:23:39,139 --> 00:23:43,671
benefit as part of the premium to the insured party or

284
00:23:43,671 --> 00:23:48,421
as part of their agreement with a self insured entity.

285
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:57,128
The third party payers may contract with a pharmacy benefit

286
00:23:57,128 --> 00:24:04,050
manager in order to get access to a network of retail pharmacies.

287
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:09,003
And the pharmacy benefit manager might also help negotiate rebate

288
00:24:09,003 --> 00:24:11,931
rebates from the drug manufacturers.

289
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:19,620
The payer is deciding whether a drug will be covered for

290
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:27,680
insurance and and to decide that drugs that are covered by that insurance plan.

291
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:32,330
Our call are put on a list which is called a formulary.

292
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:36,957
The formulary is the list of drugs that are covered by

293
00:24:36,957 --> 00:24:41,170
that insurance plan, that health plan.

294
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:46,427
And the the payers the insurers are not only deciding the formulary,

295
00:24:46,427 --> 00:24:51,412
they might have utilization management criteria which might say

296
00:24:51,412 --> 00:24:56,667
that the beneficiary must first start with a generic before they will

297
00:24:56,667 --> 00:25:02,230
approve a brand name drug on the formulary and those kinds of decisions.

298
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:06,991
Those kinds of determinations are carried out by the payers.

299
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:16,521
The payers may also negotiate and collect rebates directly from drug manufacturers.

300
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:21,609
So here this is the third party,

301
00:25:21,609 --> 00:25:26,818
the third party is potentially contracting with

302
00:25:26,818 --> 00:25:32,533
a pharmacy benefit manager in order to negotiate with

303
00:25:32,533 --> 00:25:38,270
the retail pharmacy and handle the the process here.

304
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:43,841
The third party payer will also be working with the patient,

305
00:25:43,841 --> 00:25:49,085
they will be getting the premiums from the patient As well

306
00:25:49,085 --> 00:25:54,330
as potentially from the employer sponsored contract for

307
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:58,700
for those kind of third parties And the copay and

308
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:06,130
coinsurance that the patient will pay is partly determined by the third party and

309
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:11,045
the third party might also be able to benefit from some

310
00:26:11,045 --> 00:26:15,561
of the rebates directly from the manufacturer.

311
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:24,160
So who is this pharmacy benefit manager and what is the role that they play?

312
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:29,294
So as we have been discussing the pharmacy benefit

313
00:26:29,294 --> 00:26:33,574
manager will negotiate price rebates and

314
00:26:33,574 --> 00:26:38,720
discounts directly with the manufacturer.

315
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:43,530
The pharmacy benefit manager will then contract

316
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:48,223
with the retail pharmacies to receive the drugs

317
00:26:48,223 --> 00:26:53,268
from the manufacturer at this discounted rates And

318
00:26:53,268 --> 00:26:58,196
the pharmacies will agree to participate in those

319
00:26:58,196 --> 00:27:03,430
networks in order to get those discounted drugs.

320
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:08,306
The pharmacy benefits manager will also contract

321
00:27:08,306 --> 00:27:12,949
them with a third party payers Some of this is for

322
00:27:12,949 --> 00:27:18,174
the the rebates and access to the retail pharmacies,

323
00:27:18,174 --> 00:27:21,307
some of it is also for billing and

324
00:27:21,307 --> 00:27:26,441
claims processing that is done for the third party.

325
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:33,662
And the the pharmacy benefits manager will

326
00:27:33,662 --> 00:27:39,942
also then be invoicing the third party payer for

327
00:27:39,942 --> 00:27:47,820
payment for covered drugs dispensed by the pharmacy.

328
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:55,200
So this pharmacy benefit manager is playing a crucial role.

329
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:02,117
Intermediary role with the payers with the drug manufacturers and

330
00:28:02,117 --> 00:28:08,551
with the retail pharmacies in in all of these different ways.

331
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:16,717
Finally in our system we can talk about the drug manufacturers themselves,

332
00:28:16,717 --> 00:28:21,826
the pharmaceutical industry that is producing and manufacturing

333
00:28:21,826 --> 00:28:28,040
the drugs that then get dispensed and distributed through this system.

334
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:33,551
So what is the role of the drug manufacturer other than producing and

335
00:28:33,551 --> 00:28:36,660
distributing the drugs themselves?

336
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:42,340
They published the price for sale via the wholesaler.

337
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:47,734
And this is as we noted, the wholesale acquisition

338
00:28:47,734 --> 00:28:53,129
cost price that is then used to sell make those drugs

339
00:28:53,129 --> 00:29:00,291
available to the wholesaler who then sells them to the pharmacies.

340
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:06,990
The drug manufacturers distribute the drugs to the wholesalers.

341
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:10,230
And and established these prices.

342
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:15,326
They also are negotiating the discounts and rebates to various

343
00:29:15,326 --> 00:29:21,770
entities to the pharmacy benefit managers to directly to the third party payers

344
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:27,634
if they If the third party payers decide to put the drug on the formulary,

345
00:29:27,634 --> 00:29:32,058
they might get a direct discount or rebate from the drug

346
00:29:32,058 --> 00:29:37,471
manufacturer themselves based on the volume or the market share.

347
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:43,610
Or if the third party payer decides to put the drug in

348
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:50,819
a preferred place on the formulary, meaning ahead of some other drugs,

349
00:29:50,819 --> 00:29:55,548
then the manufacturer might actually give some

350
00:29:55,548 --> 00:30:00,170
discount to directly to the third party payer.

351
00:30:01,885 --> 00:30:08,266
And finally the drug manufacturer is also negotiating discounted costs and

352
00:30:08,266 --> 00:30:13,451
rebates directly with the pharmacies who are distributing or

353
00:30:13,451 --> 00:30:16,455
dispensing the drugs to patients.

354
00:30:16,455 --> 00:30:21,357
And the drug manufacturers will also be doing some things similar to

355
00:30:21,357 --> 00:30:23,507
providers like hospitals and

356
00:30:23,507 --> 00:30:29,013
physicians who also dispense pharmaceutical drugs directly to patients.

357
00:30:29,013 --> 00:30:34,320
But we've been looking really at just the relationship through for

358
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:39,642
drugs dispensed through retail pharmacies directly to patients.

359
00:30:39,642 --> 00:30:44,834
Okay, so how can we think about

360
00:30:44,834 --> 00:30:50,828
the relationship of this system and

361
00:30:50,828 --> 00:30:55,837
the relationship to prices.

362
00:30:55,837 --> 00:31:03,136
So here let's take an example of the EpiPen.

363
00:31:03,136 --> 00:31:09,613
So Mylan Pharmaceutical is the manufacturer of the EpiPen.

364
00:31:09,613 --> 00:31:16,955
And we can think about the the pricing and these various prices and

365
00:31:16,955 --> 00:31:22,563
transactions that have occurred for the EpiPen,

366
00:31:22,563 --> 00:31:28,436
how they have changed and what is the role of the price

367
00:31:28,436 --> 00:31:34,872
set by the manufacturer which we can see here has gone up.

368
00:31:34,872 --> 00:31:39,032
And this price here is the average wholesale price.

369
00:31:39,032 --> 00:31:42,645
So remember the pharmaceutical company

370
00:31:42,645 --> 00:31:47,532
like Mylan Pharmaceutical is setting a whack price for

371
00:31:47,532 --> 00:31:51,901
the EpiPen, the wholesale acquisition price.

372
00:31:51,901 --> 00:31:56,390
And then the wholesalers are selling

373
00:31:56,390 --> 00:32:00,734
the EpiPen at the average wholesale

374
00:32:00,734 --> 00:32:05,658
price to various pharmacies to pharmacy

375
00:32:05,658 --> 00:32:10,871
benefit managers like here this example is

376
00:32:10,871 --> 00:32:17,406
the CVS Health Pharmacy Benefit Management System.

377
00:32:17,406 --> 00:32:23,194
And then ultimately what the third party payers are paying.

378
00:32:23,194 --> 00:32:29,697
So here we see the average wholesale price for

379
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:36,031
the two pack EpiPen went from about $200

380
00:32:36,031 --> 00:32:43,234
in 2013 up to just over $700 in 2017.

381
00:32:43,234 --> 00:32:49,274
But what this red line is showing that because the pharmacy

382
00:32:49,274 --> 00:32:54,206
benefit manager was negotiating discounts and

383
00:32:54,206 --> 00:32:58,891
rebates from the average wholesale price for

384
00:32:58,891 --> 00:33:06,042
the payers who contracted with the CVS Pharmacy Benefit Manager That

385
00:33:06,042 --> 00:33:11,590
the actual third party payers who had those contracts

386
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:16,767
were really paying a much lower price than what was

387
00:33:16,767 --> 00:33:22,455
the sort of list price in the average wholesale price.

388
00:33:22,455 --> 00:33:26,382
And this graph shows that even more clearly.

389
00:33:26,382 --> 00:33:31,946
So the average wholesale price Is shown

390
00:33:31,946 --> 00:33:37,178
at $730 for the two pack EpiPen.

391
00:33:37,178 --> 00:33:45,405
The CVS Health Management Pharmacy Benefit Management System

392
00:33:45,405 --> 00:33:50,372
negotiated $440 in discounts and

393
00:33:50,372 --> 00:33:54,417
rebates off of that $730.

394
00:33:54,417 --> 00:34:00,099
So then when the patient goes to the pharmacy,

395
00:34:00,099 --> 00:34:05,926
the CVS Pharmacy to pay for that to pack EpiPen,

396
00:34:05,926 --> 00:34:09,868
they have to pay a $70 copay.

397
00:34:09,868 --> 00:34:15,860
And then that means that the payer, the third party insurer,

398
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:22,546
is paying really only $220 for the price of that two pack EpiPen,

399
00:34:22,546 --> 00:34:29,947
which is really not very much higher than what they were paying in 2013.

400
00:34:29,947 --> 00:34:34,915
So for them, they didn't really care a lot about

401
00:34:34,915 --> 00:34:40,005
the change in the average wholesale price because

402
00:34:40,005 --> 00:34:45,460
they were relying on if they were able to contract with

403
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:51,952
the CVS Pharmacy Benefit Manager Contract,

404
00:34:51,952 --> 00:34:59,324
they would be receiving a stiff discount on that average wholesale price and

405
00:34:59,324 --> 00:35:03,827
so would still be paying only about $220.

406
00:35:03,827 --> 00:35:09,710
And so while the actual average wholesale

407
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:17,105
price increased 150% in a short period of time,

408
00:35:17,105 --> 00:35:21,979
the payers net cost only increased

409
00:35:21,979 --> 00:35:26,530
about 10% over this period.

410
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:32,017
And this is just an example of the drug distribution and

411
00:35:32,017 --> 00:35:39,295
reimbursement system and all of the different entities in that system,

412
00:35:39,295 --> 00:35:44,067
getting paid basically via the cost of drugs and

413
00:35:44,067 --> 00:35:48,861
the various prices that we looked at for drugs.

414
00:35:48,861 --> 00:35:54,397
So Mylan Pharmaceuticals was actually

415
00:35:54,397 --> 00:36:01,614
really getting paid a net price of about $274.

416
00:36:01,614 --> 00:36:07,960
But remember the the average wholesale price was much higher than that.

417
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:12,294
And that was partly because all of these

418
00:36:12,294 --> 00:36:17,417
different entities in that drug distribution

419
00:36:17,417 --> 00:36:22,406
system were adding quite a lot to that price,

420
00:36:22,406 --> 00:36:28,865
that then got to a price that the patients saw of $608.

421
00:36:28,865 --> 00:36:34,218
And that's in for patients in retail

422
00:36:34,218 --> 00:36:41,991
pharmacies after this system extracts prices from or

423
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:49,775
payments across all of these various transactions.

424
00:36:49,775 --> 00:36:54,480
Now, most patients who were covered by insurance

425
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:59,296
weren't paying that $608 list price either,

426
00:36:59,296 --> 00:37:06,928
they were paying a copayment that varied quite a lot and was much lower than this.

427
00:37:06,928 --> 00:37:12,586
But for a patient who did not have insurance coverage or

428
00:37:12,586 --> 00:37:17,754
did not have the significant reductions that some

429
00:37:17,754 --> 00:37:26,241
pharmacy benefit manager were able to extract from the average wholesale price,

430
00:37:26,241 --> 00:37:31,284
some patients were paying a much higher price for

431
00:37:31,284 --> 00:37:36,472
the two pack EpiPen depending on their coverage.

432
00:37:36,472 --> 00:37:41,335
And this is part of the reason that the spending

433
00:37:41,335 --> 00:37:45,210
on drugs has gone up so much in the US.

434
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:49,771
There are lots of hands in the register,

435
00:37:49,771 --> 00:37:54,200
ultimately lots of different entities

436
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:59,029
extracting profits out of the payments for

437
00:37:59,029 --> 00:38:05,486
drugs through the retail pharmaceutical supply chain.

438
00:38:05,486 --> 00:38:12,229
Now there's one more thing we need to look at as we consider drug pricing in the US.

439
00:38:12,229 --> 00:38:17,109
So overall drug prices in the us are 2 to 5 times

440
00:38:17,109 --> 00:38:22,114
higher when we compare them to other countries.

441
00:38:22,114 --> 00:38:26,507
And some of that has to do with what we just

442
00:38:26,507 --> 00:38:31,435
discussed in the system and its complexity.

443
00:38:31,435 --> 00:38:37,788
And some of it has to do with higher prices overall in the US,

444
00:38:37,788 --> 00:38:42,874
that are often justified by the pharmaceutical

445
00:38:42,874 --> 00:38:47,322
industry as saying that the US payment for

446
00:38:47,322 --> 00:38:52,660
drugs is required in order to fund the research and

447
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:55,737
development for new drugs.

448
00:38:55,737 --> 00:39:03,540
And that is a very costly high risk research program to develop new drugs.

449
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:07,511
Not all of them are effective and work out and can be brought to market.

450
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:13,212
And so the pharmaceutical industry justifies the higher prices in the US as

451
00:39:13,212 --> 00:39:19,557
saying that that's really what is funding research and development on new drugs.

452
00:39:19,557 --> 00:39:24,264
And we all value new drugs being brought to market that

453
00:39:24,264 --> 00:39:29,180
are more effective, that might be lead to treatment for

454
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:34,320
conditions and symptoms that are currently not treated.

455
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:39,758
So we accept those higher prices in many ways because

456
00:39:39,758 --> 00:39:44,337
of this need for research and development.

457
00:39:44,337 --> 00:39:49,209
Yet we really should consider the question as to whether those higher

458
00:39:49,209 --> 00:39:54,081
earnings from US drug prices really do match spending on research and

459
00:39:54,081 --> 00:39:57,459
development by the pharmaceutical industry.

460
00:39:57,459 --> 00:40:01,481
And I'm gonna rely here on a brief study by Yu et al,

461
00:40:01,481 --> 00:40:06,255
that was published in 2017 that you can click the link and

462
00:40:06,255 --> 00:40:08,989
go and look at the study directly.

463
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:13,954
But these are some of the findings from this study.

464
00:40:13,954 --> 00:40:19,521
So the Yu et al study was a study of 15 of the largest manufacture

465
00:40:19,521 --> 00:40:24,484
pharmaceutical manufacturing companies in the world.

466
00:40:24,484 --> 00:40:32,341
The 15 companies that produced the 20 top selling drugs in the year 2015.

467
00:40:32,341 --> 00:40:38,149
And what they did, they compared the excess revenue

468
00:40:38,149 --> 00:40:43,429
from the higher prices of drugs of these 20 top

469
00:40:43,429 --> 00:40:48,709
selling drugs in the US compared to those prices

470
00:40:48,709 --> 00:40:53,725
on those 20 drugs in four other countries,

471
00:40:53,725 --> 00:40:59,687
Canada, Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom.

472
00:40:59,687 --> 00:41:04,651
On average they found that the prices for

473
00:41:04,651 --> 00:41:10,053
these 20 drugs in the four other countries

474
00:41:10,053 --> 00:41:15,163
were only 41% of the prices in the US for

475
00:41:15,163 --> 00:41:18,973
those 20 top selling Drugs.

476
00:41:18,973 --> 00:41:24,545
So less than half the price in these other countries, patients in

477
00:41:24,545 --> 00:41:31,454
these other countries can purchase these drugs compared to what we pay in the US.

478
00:41:31,454 --> 00:41:38,040
So for example, let's just take a drug that we might

479
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:44,788
buy in the us you go to the pharmacy and it is $100.

480
00:41:44,788 --> 00:41:50,273
They used the whack prices adjusted for rebates,

481
00:41:50,273 --> 00:41:55,367
which is the absolute lowest possible price,

482
00:41:55,367 --> 00:42:02,172
right, as we looked through that drug distribution center.

483
00:42:02,172 --> 00:42:05,893
In the US if you're paying $100,

484
00:42:05,893 --> 00:42:10,314
in one of these other countries on average for

485
00:42:10,314 --> 00:42:14,035
the same drug, the same proportion,

486
00:42:14,035 --> 00:42:19,036
same number of pills same milliliters of the drug,

487
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:25,699
you'd be paying $41 whereas in the US you're paying $100.

488
00:42:25,699 --> 00:42:30,569
Okay, so we all ready knew that the prices were higher in the US.

489
00:42:30,569 --> 00:42:35,446
What the us all study calculated was that

490
00:42:35,446 --> 00:42:40,466
the revenues from the US price drugs was

491
00:42:40,466 --> 00:42:46,791
$116 billion 15 pharmaceutical companies.

492
00:42:46,791 --> 00:42:52,471
And so then they calculated the spending for

493
00:42:52,471 --> 00:42:59,381
research and development in those 15 companies and

494
00:42:59,381 --> 00:43:04,754
found that that was $76 billion 116

495
00:43:04,754 --> 00:43:11,067
billion is much greater than 7076 billion.

496
00:43:11,067 --> 00:43:14,593
About $40 billion dollars higher.

497
00:43:14,593 --> 00:43:19,863
And so us drug prices are even higher than

498
00:43:19,863 --> 00:43:24,513
we would expect if we if we justified

499
00:43:24,513 --> 00:43:28,853
those higher prices required for

500
00:43:28,853 --> 00:43:34,444
investment in research and development.

501
00:43:34,444 --> 00:43:40,083
So what are some conclusions we can make about drug pricing in the US.

502
00:43:40,083 --> 00:43:45,351
Drug pricing is variable based on the transaction and

503
00:43:45,351 --> 00:43:48,987
who who the transaction is between.

504
00:43:48,987 --> 00:43:52,749
Is it between the wholesaler and the pharmacy?

505
00:43:52,749 --> 00:43:56,022
Is it between the pharmacy and the third party payer?

506
00:43:56,022 --> 00:43:59,232
Is it between the pharmacy and Medicaid?

507
00:43:59,232 --> 00:44:00,356
As the payer?

508
00:44:00,356 --> 00:44:07,014
Is it between also the wholesaler and the manufacturer should be listed there.

509
00:44:07,014 --> 00:44:11,775
It's difficult to determine the true cost of a drug given

510
00:44:11,775 --> 00:44:16,039
complexity of the supply chain and the flow of funds

511
00:44:16,039 --> 00:44:20,920
between all the different entities in that supply chain.

512
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:26,663
And finally pharmaceutical manufacturers claims that higher prices for

513
00:44:26,663 --> 00:44:28,426
drugs in the in the US.

514
00:44:28,426 --> 00:44:31,915
Are needed to support research and

515
00:44:31,915 --> 00:44:36,606
development seems questionable given that

516
00:44:36,606 --> 00:44:42,138
the US the drug prices in the US exceed even the amount

517
00:44:42,138 --> 00:44:46,589
needed to cover investments in research and

518
00:44:46,589 --> 00:44:51,663
development by pharmaceutical manufacturers.

519
00:44:51,663 --> 00:44:57,231
And that concludes our discussion of drug pricing in the US.
