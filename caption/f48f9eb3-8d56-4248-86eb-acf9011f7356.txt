00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:14,930
Hello, my name is Lesliey Welch, and I am one of your primary instructors for the FPHLP program,

2
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:20,390
and I would like to introduce to you an activity, called

3
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:38,270
what is your why? And what this activity invites you to do is to share with me and with your fellow FPHLPers, what it is that brings you to this work,

4
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:43,250
who you are, and what your inquiry question might be.

5
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:48,620
A couple pieces of information that I will give you before I give you instructions,

6
00:00:48,620 --> 00:01:00,960
are first, I want to acknowledge that this activity does require you to take some risk,

7
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:11,330
and I understand that the risks we are willing to take and able to take varies greatly based on our social position and our lived experience,

8
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:16,820
the dynamics of a group, and the topics we're discussing.

9
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:27,860
I know that this time of virtual learning and virtual programing adds an additional layer of risk on to this experience,

10
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:34,640
but I invite you into brave space as you consider your why,

11
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,380
what is bringing you to population health work and learning?

12
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:48,020
And I invite you to share, to the extent that you feel comfortable, as much about your why,

13
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:56,610
right, as you would have us know. The structure I would offer, and invite you into

14
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:01,950
for the activity is to consider telling us a story.

15
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:13,070
Right? I typically, you know, try to share my why in a story that's approximately two minutes,

16
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:23,930
because, you know, it is known, right, that we connect to each other.

17
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:28,490
We connect to each other, right? Not in data, numbers, and credentials,

18
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:39,500
but in stories, and in feeling and and being anchored in a time and a space with one another and being proximate to another's experience.

19
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:50,530
Right? So I'm gonna share with you my why, why I came to work in population health in the form of a story,

20
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:58,130
and that is approximately two minutes. And then give you some instructions for

21
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:14,630
your why, which you will record on your cell phone or computer and upload to share with me and your classmates.

22
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:20,190
It was 1998 in Durban, South Africa,

23
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:31,550
four years out of apartheid and during a time when HIV and AIDS medications were becoming

24
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:41,180
increasingly available and I was an undergraduate student and doing a research project,

25
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:45,890
working on a research project at King Edward Hospital,

26
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:51,020
it was called at the time, now it's named for Nelson Mandela.

27
00:03:51,020 --> 00:04:04,910
And in this research project, I was working with pediatricians who were looking at the impact of HIV and AIDS on children and babies in South Africa.

28
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:16,760
And this one particular day I had on my, you know, white lab coat, I had my clipboard and I had gone to the ward where where the babies were,

29
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:26,570
and so as a small room with sort of rows and rows of cribs, I had been working, I would say, for at least a week and a half, maybe two,

30
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:36,710
and when I stood in the doorway, this particular day, there was a mom there who was crying over her baby's crib.

31
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:48,170
And in that moment, I realized that all of the babies I'd seen before then, who had gone, had not gone home.

32
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:58,850
I realized and understood that at that time, babies in South Africa were dying of HIV and AIDS.

33
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:05,450
That baby's here in the United States were receiving anti-HIV medications,

34
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:16,370
but the babies I was seeing in South Africa, were receiving vitamin A and an antibiotic.

35
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:28,460
And it was that moment that crystallized for me that health is not only about good doctors,

36
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:34,250
the opportunity to be healthy is not only about good doctors. South Africa had great doctors,

37
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:43,640
I was working with a whole department full of them. But that our opportunities to be healthy are about whose lives we value, and how, and

38
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:52,550
how much. Opportunities to be healthy are about business, and money, and politics.

39
00:05:52,550 --> 00:06:05,720
And that moment forever changed my career trajectory, because the questions it prompted me to ask were the questions of public health.

40
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:13,460
I would later go on to learn more about population health,

41
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:18,200
to finish my graduate degree in women's studies and go on to study health behavior, health

42
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:23,180
education, and women's reproductive health, and go back and forth, actually, to South

43
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:32,090
Africa for years doing work in townships and informal settlements around HIV and AIDS.

44
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:43,940
And that time in my life is the inspiration and the beginning of the career that I have today.

45
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:53,240
And I think of my work not only as a quote unquote career, but as my heart's work in the world.

46
00:06:53,240 --> 00:07:02,960
And I firmly believe, and this is one of my favorite books you see here, Strength to Love by Dr. Martin Luther King Junior,

47
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:14,720
that the hope of a secure and livable world lies with disciplined nonconformist who are dedicated to justice, peace and love.

48
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:23,150
And I see public health in the words of another public health scholar, not my own, public health,

49
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:34,530
as a way of doing justice, a way of asserting the value of all human lives.

50
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:40,830
With that, I would ask you to consider what is your why?

51
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:50,040
I invite you to share with us a two minute story that represents your why it can be two minutes, give or take.

52
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:53,890
And then, who are you?

53
00:07:53,890 --> 00:08:05,830
And what is your inquiry question, or what question represents what you are hoping to learn in our time together over these next few weeks?

54
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:14,470
You're invited to record your why using your cell phone or your computer. It should be

55
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:24,450
relatively simple to do and then upload it so that I, and your classmates may see it.

56
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:31,540
And there will be more instructions for you on how to do this on Canvas.

57
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:38,840
Thank you, and I look forward to our conversations in the coming weeks.
