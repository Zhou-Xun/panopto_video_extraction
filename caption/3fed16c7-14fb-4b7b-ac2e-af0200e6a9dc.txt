1
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:53,640
Here. Oh, no.

2
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:28,360
And. Good morning, everybody.

3
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:37,900
Hope you all have a good weekend. How many people dressed up?

4
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:43,060
How many people dressed up for Halloween?

5
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:51,160
Sorry. I'm born and bred in the Midwest, so when we do Halloween.

6
00:01:55,030 --> 00:02:03,150
Yes. If I could get that to go down. Okay. So I have the firm opportunity.

7
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:07,240
I sit on the board of an organization in southwest Detroit.

8
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:12,060
It's a community development organization called Urban Neighborhood Initiatives.

9
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:20,100
If you're looking for somewhere to volunteer, it's a great place. But anyway, I sit on the board and I did a trunk retreat on Saturday.

10
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:24,570
It was fun and I won. I have the best trunk.

11
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,840
I don't know what the prize was, though, so don't ask me. I just gave it back.

12
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:37,050
So. But I know what the prize was. But bragging rights.

13
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:49,620
Sierra. Give me. Okay, let me see my way sometime, like I did with my son.

14
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:57,240
And I want to talk about my daughter. One day I'm like, I sit here, I'm like, I'm going to have to, like, figure out.

15
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:04,280
I'm going to have to figure out, like, how to show you my daughter. But let's see.

16
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:18,530
I don't know if it's on the Facebook page. Oh, boy.

17
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:24,000
Yeah, well, yeah. Let me see. Let me say.

18
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:32,990
Like I'm like like all the community people. And that.

19
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:38,780
Oh, any adorable pasta, huh?

20
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,260
Your son? No, no, no, no. He's. He's one of the sons of one of the, um.

21
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:49,250
The staff people. But he is walking around like you are superior shopping.

22
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,690
Like I got me going through all these pictures. I cannot believe it. But.

23
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:58,190
But look. But it's wonderful, isn't it? And wait, wait.

24
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:01,400
I got it. I got to go back. See the cut that the.

25
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:05,030
But is that Sally or whatever she made that she is?

26
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:08,749
She's the director of Land Use and Development.

27
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:14,330
She made that whole thing. And that's our that's our executive director, Christine Bell.

28
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:19,300
All. They put my picture on there. Come on. You promised me.

29
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:24,160
I was just going to show it to I only care because I want to show it to my kids.

30
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:29,080
Like, Hey, I won the thing. But they they put it up there.

31
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:33,550
I'm going to get Brooke. Brooke is the name of the person who is.

32
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:42,920
Have the chicken. So. The chicken, son.

33
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:50,010
I'll have to put the I have to put it out later. I was like, Yeah, I won anyway.

34
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:58,110
So announcements. One.

35
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:12,350
Next Thursday, the 10th. There will not be class in here because I will be in New Orleans with for the American Evaluation Association conference.

36
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:18,970
That's right. Yeah. Conference was in person in New Orleans.

37
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:22,510
I'm so excited. So on.

38
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:28,080
So on Thursday, I will likely record the lecture.

39
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:35,050
So you could just watch it. But do not come here unless you just want to sit here and feel sentimental.

40
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:44,010
So that's announcement one and actually.

41
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:48,030
Huh? November 3rd or no?

42
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:52,540
November next. You know what? So I always do that the 10th.

43
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:57,459
So not next Thursday, but the Thursday after. I just want to start priming you for that.

44
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:04,780
So thank you for because I say next Thursday and I'm like, Oh yeah, there is a Thursday before that.

45
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:10,600
So yeah. So won't be here will likely record the lecture.

46
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:18,290
Shoot. There was something else I wanted to say. Oh, yeah.

47
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:28,309
Thanksgiving. So. And just in case you hadn't noticed in your syllabus, for those who are still trying to figure out your Thanksgiving plans,

48
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:32,030
do not let me stay in your way if you want to go on home.

49
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:41,780
I've canceled class. That was already canceled in the syllabus the Tuesday before, but I'm just giving you a heads up.

50
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:49,640
Doesn't matter, though, if you have to fly the tickets. The prices still are high, so I'm sorry.

51
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:54,470
So those are the announcements that I have.

52
00:06:55,340 --> 00:07:00,770
Oh, and other than that, if I haven't answered an email that you have sent me, you.

53
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,770
I tried to clear out my emails, but I may have missed one.

54
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:17,219
So if you sent the email in the past couple of weeks and I haven't responded to you, just send me an email and say, Hey, guess what, lady?

55
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:23,550
You didn't answer my email. It gets a little messy in there because that email is.

56
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:31,060
From 1997. So I have a lot of emails and I get that I can unsubscribe from for some reason.

57
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:38,640
All right. So we'll get started. So this week we're talking about qualitative methods.

58
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:48,750
But last week, last Thursday, we talked about probability sampling and probability sampling.

59
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:55,260
What distinguishes that from non probability is that it uses some kind of random assignment.

60
00:07:56,910 --> 00:08:04,410
The four types of strategies that we talked about on Thursday, simple random sampling.

61
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:16,180
So just randomly pulling people out. You know, often with like a random number generator, systematic sampling where you start from one point,

62
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:22,850
some random point and then systematically sample, you know, in a pattern.

63
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:26,200
So it can be every three people, every five people.

64
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:33,730
Stratified sampling where you divide your sampling frame.

65
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:38,890
So your list of people that you can sample from.

66
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:45,370
You take that divide it into stratified categories,

67
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:51,549
could be a demographic category or some other type of category that typically you think is

68
00:08:51,550 --> 00:09:02,320
meaningful on has a meaningful relationship to the outcomes or activities that you are evaluating.

69
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:08,300
Or a cluster sampling where you are typically taking advantage of preexisting

70
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:14,750
groupings like schools and you are randomly sampling within those clusters.

71
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,800
On Thursday we will talk about non probability sampling.

72
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:29,000
Which. I like, you know, there are strategies that you use to make qualitative methods,

73
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:36,570
which we're talking about today a little bit more systematic in terms of how you use who you choose to speak with,

74
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:41,930
which is why I chose take it or place it after qualitative.

75
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:49,050
But again, probability and probability can be used with either quant or call.

76
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:55,820
But today we're still gathering credible data.

77
00:09:57,050 --> 00:10:01,640
We've been talking about sampling strategies and data collection methods.

78
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:06,560
And today, what we're going to talk about is qualitative research.

79
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:17,149
I my background is actually I even though I have experience in mixed methods, I came here fully with the intention of being a qualitative researcher.

80
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:23,450
So this is. By far my most favorite unit and favorite thing to do.

81
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:29,570
As you can tell, I probably I like talking to people even though I'm an introvert and finding out things about them.

82
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:35,809
So I just love to do I just love qualitative research.

83
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:44,870
And if I'm speaking more likely than not speaking in a workshop, I'm probably doing it either on evaluation or qualitative methods.

84
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:55,070
Qualitative methods. It really involves any research that uses data that doesn't indicate ordinal values.

85
00:10:56,390 --> 00:11:08,110
So essentially, it's it involves any data collection that doesn't involve numbers and where you are.

86
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:11,890
What I mean by that is that you're not analyzing numbers.

87
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:15,440
You're analyzing and gathering anything.

88
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:22,930
Anything else. So text images.

89
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:31,740
Video. These are all examples of information that would fall under qualitative research.

90
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:37,940
And again, because I'm a qualitative research snob,

91
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:46,340
I will give the disclaimer that this isn't going to give you everything you need to be able to do qualitative research.

92
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:55,430
But the idea is, is that if you have not been exposed to it before, this will give you a sense of how to think about how to use it.

93
00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:01,490
We'll talk a little bit about analysis next week, but.

94
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:10,580
There's a lot that goes into analyzing qualitative data systematically, as well as different approaches to gathering that data.

95
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:24,530
So to think of today as just a primer. But one thing that distinguishes qualitative and quantitative is this idea of detailed description.

96
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:33,810
So it gives you the ability to. Gather information in a more open and detailed fashion.

97
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:42,959
So, for example, in contrast to a survey question where there's an answer, just a short answer,

98
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:52,050
qualitative data collection allows you to be able to gather multiple pieces of information about a subject.

99
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:56,840
So for example, if I'm doing observations,

100
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:08,630
I might collect information about how in this room that is about how your cluster together or not cluster together.

101
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:18,420
I might gather information about how the room is set up, what the temperature in the room is.

102
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:23,420
These are all kinds of things that I might gather because I think that they might be.

103
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:30,810
Useful. And understanding the results that I find.

104
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:36,890
The design often emerges as the study unfolds.

105
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:47,570
So, for example, there are approaches where you're coming in almost completely empty of hypotheses.

106
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:58,100
That figure is one such approach. Another thing that distinguishes.

107
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:06,900
Qualitative research from quantitative. Officially is that the researcher is the data gathering instrument.

108
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:14,250
And the reason why that is important to distinguish is that what it means is that everything about

109
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:23,370
my about me as a researcher is going to have some type of presence in that data collection moment.

110
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:28,320
My gender, my race. How much I talk.

111
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:34,190
You know, my presence in the room, the way that I say things.

112
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:38,420
All of these things are part. Okay.

113
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:43,040
All of these things are part of the data collection.

114
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:49,510
And so there's. Actually, I'm going to save that for this next point.

115
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:54,010
The research is also subjectively immersed in subject matter.

116
00:14:55,330 --> 00:15:02,650
So again, there's a there's a concept and that's often connected to qualitative research,

117
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:10,840
call it reflexivity, and it's where you are reflecting on your role in the data.

118
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:22,960
It makes more sense if you're thinking about a ethnographic study where you are spending time in a community, in a culture and immersing yourself.

119
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:33,390
But it still applies even if you're only contact with data collection is saying the interview or focus group setting.

120
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:40,060
What you're doing in that setting is making a difference on what results you're seeing.

121
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:48,100
And then finally, data is rich, so it's more descriptive as well as interpretive.

122
00:15:48,430 --> 00:16:05,050
It allows you to document your interpretations in emerging theories, emerging ideas, emerging ideas of constructs, concepts, outcomes, activities.

123
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:08,590
It allows you to document that as you are going.

124
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:15,520
And then when you are describing your findings, it allows you to be able to talk more about.

125
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:21,520
Interpretation of the data, that data as you're presenting them.

126
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:30,459
Now, with that said, it's very important that you distinguish whether you are taking notes during data collection or writing

127
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:39,970
it up for dissemination purposes that you are clear what's description and what interpretation,

128
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:48,460
so that you are not implying something about a program that is more about your interpretation than if they are something you actually observed.

129
00:16:52,140 --> 00:17:00,660
When do we use it in general? We use it when we are concerned with analyzing text or other media, such as images or archives.

130
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:06,020
For example, I did my actually my first study.

131
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:18,000
I feel like all sentimental. I analyzed or a cold it and analyzed hip hop videos back in.

132
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:25,260
There are early 2000. When exploring subjects in depth.

133
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:31,540
So with programs, for example, if you really want to be able to understand context, you know,

134
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:38,330
I've talked a lot about context and how it's important to think about that when you're thinking about how a program operates.

135
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:49,670
Qualitative methods allow you to be able to capture that contextual information, as well as not only what a person says about our program,

136
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:57,800
but even the way that they're saying it, because there is a difference between somebody saying, I really like that program and.

137
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:04,420
And I like that program. So it allows you to be able to kind of.

138
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:11,420
Really unpack some of those dynamics that you might see and that you can't really

139
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:17,210
capture through a survey when you're seeking to understand meaning and meaning making.

140
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:24,410
So this is helpful, especially if you're working with stakeholders and you're working together to analyze qualitative data.

141
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:30,080
It allows you to be able to look at, for example, a focus group.

142
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:39,220
Transcript. And listen to the discussions of your stakeholders about how they.

143
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:44,720
About how they under how they're making sense of what they're reading.

144
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:50,510
For example, when I did a project with,

145
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:57,919
I ran a series of focus groups with people who either sit on food policy councils

146
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:04,130
or had some relationship to food policy councils and food policy councils.

147
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,350
You're not aware simply.

148
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:20,780
Local, local group, local committees or councils of people who are making recommendations about food policies in a given area.

149
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:28,920
So like Ann Arbor has a Food Policy Council. But when I ran those focus groups there,

150
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:39,780
we I did an initial analysis and presented those results to some of the participants and then worked with them to find out,

151
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,450
okay, what are your thoughts about this?

152
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:49,320
What does this mean to you when you see this result, which gave me even more data to present in the final paper?

153
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:54,460
And then again exploring day behavior and context.

154
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:08,760
So some challenges to qualitative research. One, it is more difficult to generalize findings.

155
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:16,410
Again, what you're doing is that you're not only taking information about the context in that moment.

156
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:26,350
You are also typically impacting the data that as it is coming in again,

157
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:35,980
thinking about your presence in the data collection moment, that makes it difficult to generalize findings because.

158
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:44,390
Well, what happens if. Instead of a black female, it is a white male.

159
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:48,860
What kind of results were that? What kind of responses with that person give in that moment?

160
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:58,700
So it becomes difficult to generalize the findings because you don't know if your findings are do the research or bias or participant bias,

161
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:04,850
or it is findings that are more close to the idea of being the truth.

162
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:14,300
It is not predictive. You really cannot do a predictive analysis with qualitative data.

163
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:23,540
So unlike quantitative, where you could run the regression model and potentially understand,

164
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:33,620
you potentially understand if I have this, if I have A and B, I will get C, you can't use qualitative data to do that.

165
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:38,320
There's also a higher potential for bias. Bless you.

166
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:43,809
So, for example, participant bias, acquiescence, bias we talked about.

167
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:47,950
So the fact that people are more likely to agree or share good things.

168
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:55,310
Which is really important when you're asking about feedback and satisfaction about the program.

169
00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:02,660
You know, that's probably the biggest bias that I see with participants when I interview them.

170
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:06,230
Social acceptability bias.

171
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:15,560
If, for example, the outcomes that you are measuring have to do with some type of sensitive behavior like sexual risk behavior,

172
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:19,700
drug use, it can be a little bit.

173
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:29,360
You have to work and anticipate that there will be some social acceptability bias that is going to impact.

174
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:39,260
How much people share with you. And there are ways to kind of balance that, but you have to anticipate that there will be those types of biases.

175
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:53,750
But there's also a researcher bias. You know, unlike a certain you know, in this and I like to think of it as with qualitative data, the bias start,

176
00:22:53,750 --> 00:23:04,160
the bias is introduced more so with the collection and analysis, whereas with quantitative biases are often embedded in the development.

177
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:10,280
Um, you know, for example, you know my biases about how,

178
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:17,240
how many genders there are that's going to show up in a survey when you're developing it versus when you are working.

179
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:24,110
You are interviewing somebody and your assumptions about, oh, you identify as female.

180
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:34,060
Then maybe you don't when the person does it. So those are some biases that show up confirmation bias.

181
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:43,570
And this is one that, again, thinking about being reflexive, thinking about your presence in an interview or data collection moment.

182
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:52,729
You have to challenge any potential ideas you have about confirming a hypothesis.

183
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:59,030
You might have leading question bias where you might be.

184
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:06,760
Instead of keeping a question neutral, you lead it toward a certain directionality.

185
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:10,940
You might try, for example, to confirm that something is.

186
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:15,579
Having is causing an increase in healthy,

187
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:26,110
healthier behaviors or attitudes toward healthier behaviors where it might actually be causing someone to not do that.

188
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:31,560
And then finally, our challenge is that it's time intensive.

189
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:39,420
It is much more time intensive to deal with climate or qualitative data.

190
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:44,850
You have to clean it in the same way that you do quantitative AI doing transcripts.

191
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:58,320
You need to analyze it through processes such as coding versus running something in SPSS or AR or SAS or whatever you're running it in.

192
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:02,040
It takes a lot more time to manage the data.

193
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:10,590
One thing I always thought was interesting, for example, is that if you've ever heard of Brené Brown, she's like a psychologist.

194
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:18,570
She does all this self-help stuff. She once said that she spends a year analyzing data that she collects for her books.

195
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:24,090
It takes her a year to go through the interviews that she's collected and then write the book.

196
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:28,240
Which is. I'm like, okay.

197
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:31,839
She also does it completely manually. At least she used to.

198
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,470
Which is also. Impressive.

199
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:43,660
So it's time intensive and you have to keep that in mind when you're thinking about evaluation design.

200
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:47,470
Again, we've talked about resource limitations and allocations.

201
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:58,120
Do you have enough resources to be able to manage qualitative data regarding, you know, regardless of the benefits that you would get from it?

202
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:09,380
So we'll talk about three kinds of qualitative methods today, today.

203
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:21,300
And these are the ones that are pretty standard or common in program evaluation, work observations, focus groups and interviews.

204
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:29,180
Another thing that you do use that I'm not talking about today is documentation review.

205
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:33,860
So you're reviewing notes from meetings reviewing.

206
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:40,520
Maybe they have transcripts from different events.

207
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:44,090
They have materials related to the program.

208
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:53,320
That is also a common method. But. It's because it's pretty self-explanatory.

209
00:26:53,330 --> 00:27:04,930
I'm not going to share it in this context, but just know that document review is also a pretty common method that is used for program evaluation.

210
00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:13,770
So observations. So the first thing we're talking about is observations.

211
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:18,160
I don't know why this picture tickles me. It's like, you think I've never seen it before.

212
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:32,020
Maybe because I just got dumb. Pass. Now, candy, the kids. One teenager, one side story and one teenager promises like 16 years old.

213
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:37,020
He walks up to me. He walks up like our driveway with like a cape.

214
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:42,740
Like he's a vampire. And he's just like. What he is really committing to this bit here.

215
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:46,870
And then he got. Like I didn't know what to do.

216
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:51,890
I'm like, okay. Like, if you were five, I'd certainly mess with you.

217
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:56,870
But I don't want to, you know, make you feel like I'm treating you like a child.

218
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:02,790
But I laughed anyway. Observation. But he looked like this little boy.

219
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:04,470
That's why it made me think about it.

220
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:14,400
But observations are data that's collected by watching and studying phenomena as they naturally occur in the environment.

221
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:27,040
So regardless if I'm structured or unstructured in my observation work, it's ultimately coming down to watching things as they're happening.

222
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:40,980
So field observations are an example, participant observations where you are participating in something as you're observing it.

223
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:45,510
So you might be observing an event and.

224
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:51,480
Interacting with people at the event, for example.

225
00:28:56,010 --> 00:29:01,940
In program evaluation. We use this often to document activities,

226
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:10,040
behaviors and physical environments without having to depend on what people remember

227
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:17,420
or what they're willing to share with you when you engage in some question asking.

228
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:34,850
So, for example, in a process evaluation, I might use this strategy or this method to observe how well a program or how closely a program facilitator.

229
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:39,410
Sticks to their program plan.

230
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:44,540
You know, they might have an agenda that's been tested.

231
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:48,920
And the CDC is like, this is a great agenda.

232
00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:53,840
You know, we're going to give you some you know, we're going to recommend you use it.

233
00:29:54,410 --> 00:30:04,010
And as an evaluator, my role might be watching that program facilitator to see are they doing the.

234
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:09,670
Are they presenting the components of a program in the order that they were?

235
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:12,640
In the order they were written?

236
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:22,550
An outcome evaluation example might be observing participants cooking skills during a nutrition education cooking workshop.

237
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:27,110
Maybe observing. Are they?

238
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:30,830
You know how much you know how many vegetables are they using?

239
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:43,880
Are they using techniques to make sure that as they're cooking vegetables, that the vitamins aren't cooked out of out of the food, for example?

240
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:51,350
So I can be watching and I can have things in mind as I'll talk about in a second.

241
00:30:51,380 --> 00:31:00,260
Or I might just be watching the C when I learn. And so many things that you can observe.

242
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:07,700
Right. You know, I've already alluded to this. You can look at different characteristics of the people in the room.

243
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:13,510
You know, you can listen to how they talk about a program.

244
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:21,340
You might have two youth who are engaging in a cooking class and they might, you know.

245
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:29,380
They might talk about how they're actually enjoying this or joking around how all of them learning how to cook some broccoli,

246
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:33,280
you know, or you could be watching this.

247
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:38,620
See if they talk about the knowledge they have about cooking vegetables,

248
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:46,540
attitudes, demographics, nonverbal behavior, which is, I think, great to observe.

249
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:54,840
Are people excited about what they're doing? Are they participating because they are they they frown?

250
00:31:54,850 --> 00:31:59,170
Are they frowning? Are they jumping up and down?

251
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:08,650
And they laughing, are they not, you know, are their faces flat of affect?

252
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:16,910
So these are things that you can observe as well. Interactions, for example, if you want to know how well does.

253
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:24,230
How well do participants appreciate you work with the facilitator?

254
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,390
You can observe how they're interacting with the facilitator.

255
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:31,080
Are they asking questions? Are they?

256
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:38,290
Are they responding in a positive way to a facilitator?

257
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:45,310
You can also look at prisoners. How clear are the instructions that they're presenting?

258
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:50,890
How are they using materials? Physical surroundings as well.

259
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:57,070
Is it hot? Is it cold? Are people sitting close to the facilitator?

260
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:04,150
And then finally, products of a program. Are participants giving demonstrations?

261
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:10,570
How are they using brochures? Are they leaving the brochures in the room after they leave?

262
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:18,580
So there are lots of things that you can actually observe that relate to program evaluation.

263
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:25,180
So some considerations when you're using observations.

264
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:30,790
One is ethical considerations. It is not a good idea.

265
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:40,750
It is not particularly ethical to do observations without letting people know that you are there as an observer,

266
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:51,410
even if you are a participant observer. And whether that means that somebody introduces you at the beginning.

267
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:57,810
Or you if you're engaging with people and you let them know, hey, I'm an evaluator.

268
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:01,220
I'm, you know, taking notes on what's going on.

269
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:07,910
It's important that you let people know that your presence in the room is as a data collection instrument.

270
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:12,780
Level of interaction with participants.

271
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:20,400
Again, it can range the gamut from being a part to our being somebody who is not participating.

272
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:27,870
So that means the creepy person in the room. I'm sure you see a man just sitting in the corner staring.

273
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:36,540
Or are you actually talking with people as they're engaging?

274
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:40,980
But they also need to be balanced with not swaying the results.

275
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:49,260
Because it's one thing for me to talk with youth who are trying to exhibit leadership skills by working in a team.

276
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:57,540
And it's enough, you know, to solve a problem. Say they're doing like building a tower with marshmallows in toothpicks.

277
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,100
That's their activity.

278
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:07,900
It's one thing for me to observe them as they're doing it and to talk with them as they're doing it, to see what they're thinking in that moment.

279
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:14,530
But it's another thing for me that actually helped them build the toothpick and marshmallow tower.

280
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:24,280
So you have to keep that in mind when you're doing observations that you don't want to actually sway results in one way or the other.

281
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:32,140
There's also, again, that susceptibility of the bias, and that relates to that last example.

282
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:35,830
How much is your presence swaying what you're seeing?

283
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:43,480
Obviously, participating and helping is one and of bias.

284
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:53,500
But again, also surprisingly, standing in the corner introduces a lot of bias on the part of the people you're observing.

285
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,470
Resource availability.

286
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:08,470
It costs money to be able to observe because you're, you know, typically paying somebody to do that work and you're not getting a lot of data.

287
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:18,300
Comparatively speaking. As you would if you were doing a survey or even doing a focus group.

288
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:26,400
You don't get a lot of data when you're observing in comparison to those other methods.

289
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:31,550
And then finally, the type of observation, the conduct.

290
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:42,460
Which relates to the level of interaction with the participants, but also relates to how structured your data collection instrument is.

291
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:55,540
And you can classify observations and you know, too broad categories structured and unstructured.

292
00:36:56,260 --> 00:37:07,640
And this really relates to. The in some ways is the difference between taking a deductive versus a inductive approach to observing.

293
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:18,470
When you are doing a structured observation, you decide in that moment or you decide prior to the moment, rather what it is you're going to observe.

294
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:23,620
So oftentimes you see this in the form of a checklist.

295
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:29,370
You already decide. I'm looking for, you know.

296
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:35,170
You know, how many interactions do you have with the facilitator?

297
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:42,260
Tom, some examples or you're counting the total number of people at a community garden.

298
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:53,390
And some considerations that you need to make when you're doing structure is that you meet some type of checklist.

299
00:37:55,710 --> 00:38:07,410
Excuse me and know that it's typically typically providing quantitative data from either counting or ranking or rating.

300
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:11,160
So, for example, there are tools that are used to.

301
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:18,640
Tools used to observe environment and youth programs that I've used before.

302
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:21,520
And so those are on a rating basis.

303
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:32,500
You rate, for example, the size of the room from 1 to 5 or you rate the availability of snacks or the quality of snacks from 1 to 5.

304
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:40,570
So those are examples of structured observations that you might make or see on the tool.

305
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:47,340
In contrast, your unstructured observation is a more inductive approach where you.

306
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,970
You might have, like, a rough sense of what you're looking for.

307
00:38:51,980 --> 00:39:00,800
Like I have a unstructured observation template form that I use and there is a space for.

308
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:05,060
What does the room look like or what?

309
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:08,120
What is the event? How are people responding?

310
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:18,580
So it doesn't mean that you're completely. That you're always just completely without some kind of data collection structure.

311
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:29,200
It just means that you are open to whatever you are observing and you would document things, even if they don't necessarily fall within a checklist.

312
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:37,569
So what that would look like in contrast to a structured checklist or a structured observation,

313
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:43,990
is that in this example you see here, it says, go to the community garden and write everything down.

314
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:48,520
You see here, touch, case, mail, etc.

315
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:56,960
So you're being a little bit more open ended and some considerations is that it is inclusive.

316
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:02,660
So you can that it allows you to be able to document things that you hadn't thought about before.

317
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:10,010
And then it provides more qualitative data about the subject at hand.

318
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:25,019
So some common uses of unstructured evaluation or observations are too many in shins in this sentence.

319
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:35,280
Common uses of unstructured observation in evaluation, documenting interactions, documenting nonverbal cues.

320
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:44,430
You know how participants, for example, express their opinions, describing the quality of the delivery,

321
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:50,250
or capturing how staff and participants talk about their experiences.

322
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,329
And some best practices.

323
00:40:53,330 --> 00:41:04,010
If you're going to do unstructured observation, it's helpful to have some kind of framework or theory or idea of what you're observing ahead of time.

324
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:08,720
So, again, you're not just going in completely empty.

325
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:15,880
You might have a template that has, you know, I'm going to look in, I'm going to look at interactions.

326
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:25,340
I'm going to look at the state of the room, for example, if it's possible, observe on multiple days and have multiple observers.

327
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:30,290
Typically, if I'm working with a client and I'm engaging in a lot of meetings,

328
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:37,670
I'm going to be observing those meetings as well as just attending to report on.

329
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:44,930
Evaluation activities and their use of technology can make field notes more efficient.

330
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:54,920
I used to carry around, for example, a note, a Galaxy Note, because it had a pen and it was big.

331
00:41:55,310 --> 00:42:03,500
So, you know, if I were doing like a site visit, I could just take notes on my phone,

332
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:12,590
in my little pen and transfer those notes to a template form later on.

333
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:17,840
Also take pictures to help remind me of what I saw.

334
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:22,370
So those are two uses of technology that you can use in observation.

335
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:34,050
Some common uses of structured observations and evaluation if you're assessing specific processes according to an established standard.

336
00:42:34,610 --> 00:42:37,820
So, for example, you already know that you are looking for.

337
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:43,620
Vegetable, fruit or vegetable intake, as you'll see in the checklist.

338
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:52,590
Next, you're documenting things that you have predetermined and then again, gathering information that will be quantified.

339
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:58,990
So here's an example of a checklist that you might use and notice that it has,

340
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:06,820
you know, basic questions like does the sell the store sell fruit and vegetables?

341
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:15,280
And if so, you have a list of vegetables and a place where you can know how many that you see on sale.

342
00:43:17,150 --> 00:43:27,350
And then what that would do is connect to an indicator like the percent of stores in the region offering various types of fruits and veggies.

343
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:37,310
Some best practices when it comes to structured observation.

344
00:43:38,330 --> 00:43:45,830
Using clear and detailed observation forms and checklists, record observations as they happen.

345
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:51,440
And then having multiple observers and assessing integrator reliability.

346
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:02,930
Any questions about observations? Yes.

347
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:14,600
My favorite place. These are.

348
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:22,560
I made. We might actually.

349
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:27,430
Now. Not.

350
00:44:29,010 --> 00:44:32,850
No. So I'm going to answer the second question first.

351
00:44:32,890 --> 00:44:42,719
So the second question, if you didn't hear it, was what your presence potentially change what you're seeing like, for example,

352
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:49,230
are people doing something, they're paying more attention to what they're doing so they can, you know, look good.

353
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:55,479
Yes. It does change, but that is a limitation.

354
00:44:55,480 --> 00:45:01,090
And. That's why it helps to triangulate that data.

355
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:11,350
So, for example, I have my observations about their engagement and participants engagement and activity, but then also do a focus group.

356
00:45:11,830 --> 00:45:19,090
And so if they say, Well, I wasn't so excited about it in the focus group, then I might counter with,

357
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:24,730
oh, well, you know, when you when I was observing you, you did blah, blah, blah.

358
00:45:24,790 --> 00:45:26,170
Can you say more about that?

359
00:45:26,530 --> 00:45:39,250
So I'm online and I'm looking at results from different data sources to help better understand if there is a bias that was introduced.

360
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:47,080
But typically, yeah, there's going to be an impact. And so part of your role as the evaluator is to try and.

361
00:45:49,610 --> 00:45:56,480
At least at the very least flagged that that better limitation in terms of IRB approval.

362
00:45:57,890 --> 00:46:02,090
I'll be honest with you. The IAB is amazing to me.

363
00:46:03,550 --> 00:46:10,870
I'm looking at the owl like the owl as a person. Typically, evaluations are not subject to IAB oversight.

364
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:15,700
And the reason why is because we're studying programs that people which.

365
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:18,610
Doesn't. Like.

366
00:46:18,610 --> 00:46:29,440
I do think that the distinguish distinguishing of those two doesn't necessarily make sense, but because there are no technically human subjects,

367
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:34,810
even if we're talking to people according to the RB, we're not doing human subjects research.

368
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:47,040
With that said, typically it helps just to pretend that you have IAB oversight to make sure that you're being ethically being ethical about the work.

369
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:56,990
But. Unless you're collecting like blood or something like that as part of the evaluation, they're usually like, okay, you're cool, you're good.

370
00:46:57,910 --> 00:47:02,470
Even with sensitive, vulnerable populations like prisoners.

371
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:11,050
Although they will kind of. Or pregnant women they'll they'll try to be a little bit more active and keeping track.

372
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:25,090
Any other questions about observations? So out west over here, an evaluation land, according to the IAB.

373
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:30,130
They are doing all kinds of stuff. Anyway.

374
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:38,070
What is a focus group. So we'll talk about focus groups. I started my I film myself telling another story.

375
00:47:38,370 --> 00:47:43,350
I'm like, I'm not going to do it. This doesn't relate to this at all. Focus groups.

376
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:49,300
People. Most people know what a focus group is.

377
00:47:50,650 --> 00:48:02,530
The points that I will emphasize here, though, is that if you are thinking about the optimal size of a focus group, you want 6 to 12 people.

378
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:07,030
I've done Amy. I've done up to.

379
00:48:09,430 --> 00:48:14,410
In one ridiculous moment last winter, 30 people in a focus group.

380
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:21,310
I would not recommend that. It was totally ridiculous and it was not planned.

381
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:26,380
I'll just say that it was not planned. It was people hearing about the incentive.

382
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:30,890
And we just had a whole bunch of people show up. I.

383
00:48:35,550 --> 00:48:38,800
You can't really. Well, you can't get everyone to talk.

384
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:45,510
And so part of the part of the benefit of a focus group is that you're capturing that human interaction.

385
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:52,860
And if you have a huge group of people, some things are definitely going to happen.

386
00:48:53,550 --> 00:48:56,700
Some people aren't participating or interacting.

387
00:48:57,210 --> 00:49:00,660
And if it's in person, people are interacting with each other.

388
00:49:03,510 --> 00:49:14,550
And not with him in the group. So keeping it to about 12 or 15 people at the most allows for a little bit more control of the space.

389
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:21,360
It's just really hard to facilitate a conversation when it's that big and to be able to capture human interaction.

390
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:35,700
Can I come by? I would not recommend it only because I'm.

391
00:49:37,330 --> 00:49:44,200
I mean, you could do them two separate times. Like you can have an observation moment one day and then you can have a focus group another day.

392
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:54,850
But if you're talking about doing them at the same time, I would not recommend that because people are either there for something like an event or,

393
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:59,260
you know, a workshop or they're there for a focus group.

394
00:50:01,570 --> 00:50:05,260
And so that the logistics of trying to grab people.

395
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:10,470
To participate in an impromptu focus group is.

396
00:50:11,230 --> 00:50:14,370
It's just probably not going to happen.

397
00:50:14,670 --> 00:50:20,100
Now, you can combine interviews and observations, but I would not do that with a focus group.

398
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:25,790
Mm hmm. Um. Yeah.

399
00:50:26,090 --> 00:50:30,680
Oh, and so the other point I want to emphasize is that there's some similar characteristic.

400
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:35,390
So it can either be their part, you know, and they could be as basic as their participants.

401
00:50:36,790 --> 00:50:42,820
Generally, though, even if we are doing participant focus groups, we want to try and find some.

402
00:50:43,450 --> 00:50:50,589
We're also working with some additional layer of idea of similar characteristics.

403
00:50:50,590 --> 00:51:01,570
So I might have same gender focus groups, or I might have a focus groups divided by age or by geographic locale.

404
00:51:04,710 --> 00:51:14,640
Why do we use them? They're relatively low cost unless you offer an incentive of $75, and then everybody in their mama comes to your focus group.

405
00:51:15,210 --> 00:51:18,570
That's what I learned last year. Don't do that.

406
00:51:19,890 --> 00:51:27,020
It. And I could write a paper usher write a paper on that one the time efficient.

407
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:35,500
So instead of doing five or six one hour interviews, you can do one focus group with six people.

408
00:51:36,610 --> 00:51:45,960
Provides a deeper level of understanding about a subject because in part you're seeing how people are interacting and talking about a subject.

409
00:51:46,510 --> 00:51:55,720
So you're kind of getting a sense of the group norms or groupthink or cultural norms around a given issue or behavior or program.

410
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:05,060
Even if it's something that people might in an interview disclose that they disagree with.

411
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:19,790
For example, attitudes about. Like if you are looking at a program that's meant to promote inclusion or understanding about people of different races.

412
00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:31,460
If, for example, you're operating in a discriminatory environment or a biased environment, chances are people are going to either endorse or be quiet.

413
00:52:31,580 --> 00:52:40,970
They're not one to challenge in the focus group. And so that gives you a sense of what's going on in the context, the environment.

414
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:54,040
It does overcome literacy barriers. So if you're working with a population as low literacy or you know, or you're working, for example, with children.

415
00:52:55,100 --> 00:53:01,230
I can't imagine doing the focus group with children, but. You know.

416
00:53:02,270 --> 00:53:11,180
It's possible. A focus group allows you to overcome some of those barriers that you would see with survey administration.

417
00:53:14,930 --> 00:53:18,920
So in terms of program evaluation, how do we use it?

418
00:53:20,270 --> 00:53:26,270
We use it to get more in-depth information on people's perceptions, attitudes or beliefs.

419
00:53:29,110 --> 00:53:38,200
And that again can also refer to their the group attitudes about a program or a facilitator or setting.

420
00:53:39,310 --> 00:53:46,150
We also use it to supplement or I prefer to think of it more, speak to quantitative data.

421
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:56,659
So for example. You might have done a survey and realized that there a survey on sexual risk behavior

422
00:53:56,660 --> 00:54:05,750
and condom use and you realize that condom use drops with 16 to 17 year olds.

423
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:11,870
So you can do a focus group to find out what's the drop between 14 and 15.

424
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:20,040
216 the 17. You could also use a focus group to pretest a newly developed questionnaire.

425
00:54:20,430 --> 00:54:27,630
So when we talked last week about pre-testing or pilot testing an instrument, a focus group is a good way to do that.

426
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:34,320
Some planning considerations for using focus groups.

427
00:54:34,770 --> 00:54:45,220
You need space. You know, sometimes nonprofits don't have a space for you to use it or to be able to do a focus group.

428
00:54:45,230 --> 00:54:51,020
So you just need to keep that in mind. You also want the space to be somewhere that can be confidential.

429
00:54:53,230 --> 00:54:56,530
You know, so you could do a focus group in an open space.

430
00:54:56,530 --> 00:55:08,140
But generally it's better to have such a space that somewhat closed off so that people feel a little bit more secure in sharing sensitive information.

431
00:55:09,070 --> 00:55:14,280
And when I say open, like. I mean, like a space where people are going in and out.

432
00:55:17,990 --> 00:55:23,130
Mm hmm. Yeah.

433
00:55:23,270 --> 00:55:28,049
Yeah that's what I that's why I got bit in the but but the 50 because what they did is they shared

434
00:55:28,050 --> 00:55:34,150
the link even though they were supposed to register they all shared the link and that shows up.

435
00:55:34,150 --> 00:55:38,850
There's like 90 people on the thing and we already had multiple facilitators that day.

436
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:47,570
So, yes, I have done it and. But when you know it's okay, it's okay.

437
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:52,860
There are limitations. But people, if they know each other, it's better.

438
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:58,470
You get better results, more engagement. Oh.

439
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:03,080
Sorry, I'm having flashbacks. I was like, This sucks.

440
00:56:04,490 --> 00:56:09,350
Hey, don't focus groups also, but I like to engage with people.

441
00:56:11,090 --> 00:56:17,020
Recruitment. You know, just the even the simple thing of what time are we going to have the focus group?

442
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:24,760
So, you know, if you're doing this in real life, I recommend lead time.

443
00:56:24,790 --> 00:56:29,980
So because then you can, you know, for example, you schedule it six weeks out.

444
00:56:30,490 --> 00:56:32,980
Typically, six weeks is my little metric.

445
00:56:33,670 --> 00:56:42,459
I like to schedule it six weeks out so people have a chance to adjust their schedules or, you know, recruitment in terms of drawing people in.

446
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:51,380
You know, I talked about incentives. Typically at this point, I would not offer less than.

447
00:56:53,130 --> 00:56:57,060
$30 per person to do a focus group.

448
00:56:57,570 --> 00:57:02,970
And I think that's low. Like, that's the low end unless unless I'm doing it for free.

449
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:06,780
Meaning the people are participating in not giving an incentive.

450
00:57:06,780 --> 00:57:13,380
But if I'm offering an incentive, usually the metric I use is what's a reasonable hourly rate.

451
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:21,770
Like if you get paid $15 an hour and a job in a focus group for 90 minutes.

452
00:57:23,110 --> 00:57:29,830
You know, 25 and 25, but still you want to up it a little bit more the facilitator.

453
00:57:30,220 --> 00:57:35,350
So you definitely need with focus groups, not a person who likes to tell stories all the time.

454
00:57:35,350 --> 00:57:44,440
Although I don't do this and focus group facilitation. You want somebody who can remain neutral, keep it keep control of the conversation,

455
00:57:44,470 --> 00:57:54,200
especially in those moments where it can get a little bit contentious or when people are not speaking.

456
00:57:54,220 --> 00:58:00,730
So you need to have a facilitator that's trained to be able to keep conversation going while also.

457
00:58:02,490 --> 00:58:09,510
Not leading the conversation. Discussion guide.

458
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:14,050
You have to think about the questions because you want them to be quashed.

459
00:58:14,180 --> 00:58:20,160
You want to write questions that are. Appropriate for a group.

460
00:58:21,590 --> 00:58:26,360
And you have to make sure that your you don't have too many questions, so you leave room for speaking.

461
00:58:26,930 --> 00:58:33,920
So generally, if I'm doing a 90 minute focus group, I'm keeping the questions to about nine or ten at the most.

462
00:58:34,550 --> 00:58:40,010
And at least one of those question is questions are something a variation on.

463
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:44,380
Tell me about yourself. Or tell me about this program.

464
00:58:44,740 --> 00:58:53,110
Tell me about your organization and then the method of recording.

465
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:57,610
Typically, it helps the audio record a focus group.

466
00:58:58,210 --> 00:59:07,060
But if you're having something that is related to a sensitive subject, it might be more appropriate to have somebody taking notes.

467
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:11,519
Only ideally you're having both.

468
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:22,500
You have a recording and a note taker. And that way that note taker is making notes about things, about how people are interacting with each other or.

469
00:59:24,540 --> 00:59:30,000
You know, those nonverbal cues. Some limitations.

470
00:59:31,180 --> 00:59:35,770
There are power dynamics and pressure pressure. So, you know, you think about the 50 people.

471
00:59:36,220 --> 00:59:40,630
If you are working with too big of a group, somebody is taking charge.

472
00:59:41,860 --> 00:59:45,940
And that defeats the purpose of having a focus group.

473
00:59:45,950 --> 00:59:51,100
So you need to know how to manage that. It's susceptible to facilitator bias.

474
00:59:51,370 --> 00:59:56,199
Just like with our qualitative data collection, there's a lack of armament.

475
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:59,950
And in there many people are seeing each other.

476
01:00:00,340 --> 01:00:06,340
Even if it's on Zoom, they are seeing each other to a certain extent.

477
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:18,360
Although I didn't notice that with Zoom focus groups, people tend to keep their cameras off, especially if they were younger and use the chat a lot.

478
01:00:18,370 --> 01:00:23,320
So one thing that we have to learn with the Zoom focus groups is that the chat.

479
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:29,430
So you have to accommodate questions that allow for chat use.

480
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:44,280
Like how many of you, you know? How how many of you know what a ERP is as a focus set of focus groups I did with the 50 people for AARP.

481
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:54,030
How many of you know who it is, what it is? So we started reframing our questions for chat and then it's time consuming to analyze the data.

482
01:00:55,300 --> 01:01:00,100
And I feel like I've seen a couple of hands start to go up. So any questions about focus groups?

483
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:18,100
Yeah. So the question is if you got a private message on Zoom.

484
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:23,420
While facilitating what you share that with the larger group.

485
01:01:24,510 --> 01:01:25,880
The best answer I can give you.

486
01:01:25,900 --> 01:01:34,710
It depends if I think it's something sensitive or something like the tone of it suggests that they they knew they were sharing it only with me.

487
01:01:35,250 --> 01:01:44,620
Then, though, sometimes, though, you can tell that they're they meant to share it with the whole group and they just forgot to click.

488
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:47,790
Everyone versus a specific person.

489
01:01:49,230 --> 01:01:55,500
Then in that case, I would say, you know, Lauren and Lauren said blah, blah, blah.

490
01:01:56,010 --> 01:02:08,280
So in that, actually, to be honest with you, I do that even if the chat is for everyone because that's a way of prompting more conversation.

491
01:02:08,940 --> 01:02:17,820
So you might need to see if any of you have taken online classes the same thing your instructors do it like, Oh, Lauren said this in a chat.

492
01:02:18,180 --> 01:02:21,540
Susan said this in the chat. Ronald said this in the chat.

493
01:02:23,870 --> 01:02:27,260
It's just a good practice to do to make the conversation keep moving.

494
01:02:31,550 --> 01:02:39,690
Any other questions about focus groups? All right.

495
01:02:41,090 --> 01:02:44,510
Okay. So the last thing we'll talk about are interviews.

496
01:02:45,940 --> 01:02:48,999
I surprisingly could not find the definition for interviews.

497
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:52,870
I'm actually really surprised by this. So I made this one up.

498
01:02:53,740 --> 01:02:58,900
Data collection data collected by asking questions 1 to 1 with a respondent.

499
01:03:01,790 --> 01:03:06,530
I will say that you could do an interview with, like, two or three people.

500
01:03:07,310 --> 01:03:16,930
There's. Probably not a hard and fast rule about whether it's a focus that becomes a focus like when it becomes a focus group.

501
01:03:18,070 --> 01:03:21,110
And a lot of ways it's about intention. Right.

502
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:27,100
So again, I'm using a focus group because I want to ask questions that refer to the group.

503
01:03:27,670 --> 01:03:32,260
What do you all think about how did you all feel about participating in this program?

504
01:03:33,970 --> 01:03:38,680
But sometimes when you're doing interviews, a one person interview turns into a three person interview.

505
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:51,610
Just but typically it's 1 to 1. Three approaches to qualitative interviews.

506
01:03:52,270 --> 01:03:55,270
Unstructured interviews. That's where you go in.

507
01:03:56,660 --> 01:04:07,040
Completely without questions. And so this is what for one, this is one example where I might combine observations and interviews.

508
01:04:07,970 --> 01:04:17,060
I might be observing an event and decide I want to speak to ten people about their well, about what they're learning during this event.

509
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:24,340
So I approach ten people and say, What are you learning? And I write in document that data.

510
01:04:24,370 --> 01:04:32,470
It's a mini interview, but it's unstructured and it's a mini, unstructured interview, semi-structured interviews.

511
01:04:33,190 --> 01:04:38,259
These are these tend to be the ones at least that I do most commonly.

512
01:04:38,260 --> 01:04:46,660
And honestly, you know, any evaluators I work with typically using this by structure interviews that are baby.

513
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:54,880
Oh, babies. Sorry. If any of you have babies, feel free to bring them.

514
01:04:54,890 --> 01:04:59,340
I like to play with babies. I'm not.

515
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:06,720
I promise you, I'm not a weirdo. I just like babies. They're funny questions and topic with semi-structured interviews.

516
01:05:07,710 --> 01:05:14,250
Questions and topics are outlined, but the interviewer has freedom to vary the wording in the order of questions.

517
01:05:16,460 --> 01:05:22,130
I like semi-structured the most because it allows for the conversation to flow.

518
01:05:22,490 --> 01:05:29,810
So typically I'm going to write again about if I'm doing the hour long interview, I'm going to write about 8 to 10 questions.

519
01:05:30,890 --> 01:05:36,900
I'm assuming that there are some prompts as well. Like, How do you feel about that?

520
01:05:38,190 --> 01:05:41,760
But I don't count those in the the the main count.

521
01:05:44,170 --> 01:05:50,920
But it allows me, you know, if and when I ask one, a person responds to one.

522
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:55,360
But also question six, I don't have to say, okay, wait, stop.

523
01:05:55,900 --> 01:06:03,340
That's question six. Let's wait to you know, I can actually ask a question six and then go back to two.

524
01:06:03,700 --> 01:06:13,750
So that allows for more conversational conversational interview and then standardized open ended interviews.

525
01:06:14,140 --> 01:06:20,200
Questions and probes are fully written out, and the interviewer must follow the protocol for each interview.

526
01:06:20,650 --> 01:06:30,860
Um. These are typically used, especially if you are confirming something like a theory.

527
01:06:32,990 --> 01:06:41,880
And so for that reason, I don't see it used a lot in program evaluation because we're not typically confirming a theory or a hypothesis.

528
01:06:41,900 --> 01:06:50,240
What we're doing is trying to learn more about the program. In interviews.

529
01:06:50,410 --> 01:06:56,500
You know, as I mentioned, there are several other focus groups, some considerations between the society,

530
01:06:56,500 --> 01:07:03,820
between the interview and the focus group and group interaction, if you want for.

531
01:07:05,710 --> 01:07:15,850
If you're looking for more group level response or maybe some more thoughts that get generated.

532
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:22,990
In the space of multiple people talking about something you think that's likely to happen?

533
01:07:23,410 --> 01:07:29,290
Use a focus group. Use interviews when it's likely that.

534
01:07:33,430 --> 01:07:40,570
Like if the group interaction is likely to be to undermine the purpose of the interview.

535
01:07:42,070 --> 01:07:49,030
So again, if you think that, for example, you're doing something that might be contentious, like racial dynamics,

536
01:07:49,570 --> 01:07:57,160
it might be better just to do the interview instead of having like a mixed race focus group where there might be some issues.

537
01:07:58,900 --> 01:08:01,720
Another consideration is group or peer pressure.

538
01:08:02,380 --> 01:08:12,490
If you think that in doing the data collection process that conflicting opinions gathering, that might be helpful.

539
01:08:14,110 --> 01:08:18,040
Feel free to use a focus group in interviews again if.

540
01:08:20,170 --> 01:08:26,170
You think that peer pressure is actually going to inhibit your response from your participants?

541
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:37,059
And similar to sensitivity of topic. If you think that it's not that sensitive, self really is a focus group,

542
01:08:37,060 --> 01:08:46,030
but if it's a seriously sensitive topic and people wouldn't be willing to talk about it in a group like for example,

543
01:08:47,770 --> 01:08:59,080
you are working to evaluate a program that works with street level sex workers and not going to really talk to other people about what they're doing.

544
01:09:00,650 --> 01:09:05,180
It'd be better to use it. Interview and then focus groups.

545
01:09:05,690 --> 01:09:10,520
If you have a limited number of topics to cover, it's good to use it.

546
01:09:11,410 --> 01:09:17,080
But if you have a lot of things you want to talk about, use interviews,

547
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:24,040
and so that way you have the time to do it, even if it ends up being, for example, a two hour interview.

548
01:09:28,210 --> 01:09:31,210
Some of the advantages of focus groups.

549
01:09:31,390 --> 01:09:37,210
I'm sorry interviews is the same as focus groups. You get face to face contact.

550
01:09:38,470 --> 01:09:45,130
You have some flexibility in administering the interview depending on the circumstances.

551
01:09:48,110 --> 01:09:50,930
And it allows you to be able to clarify things.

552
01:09:51,260 --> 01:09:59,360
That's probably the biggest benefit to focus groups and interviews is that allows you in real time to be able to clarify what people are saying.

553
01:10:03,110 --> 01:10:06,920
So some common uses of interviews and program evaluation.

554
01:10:07,490 --> 01:10:10,490
Learning about people's experience in a program.

555
01:10:11,450 --> 01:10:22,120
Concerns that they might have. You know, again, especially with interviews, there's a little bit more confidentiality.

556
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:28,270
So people might be willing to share more concerns with you than they would even in a focus group.

557
01:10:29,950 --> 01:10:40,780
What we also use interviews for learning about people's expectations for a program or even the stakeholders expectations.

558
01:10:48,130 --> 01:10:56,010
I can also use interviews if I want to know what's most salient or what stands out more to participants.

559
01:10:57,840 --> 01:11:04,530
And I can even, you know, for example, quantify that information if I have enough interviews and it's worth quantifying.

560
01:11:05,970 --> 01:11:14,590
And then what changes do people perceive? I think like documenting change is possible in a focus group,

561
01:11:14,590 --> 01:11:21,989
but you get more detail and more space to unpack how the change occurred within

562
01:11:21,990 --> 01:11:27,149
the interview because you have that one on one interaction where you can say,

563
01:11:27,150 --> 01:11:37,380
okay, well tell me more about how you experienced, you know, going from thinking about using a condom to using it in a particular situation.

564
01:11:38,420 --> 01:11:42,020
It's a little harder to do that in the focus group. You just don't have the time.

565
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:47,290
You're waiting, you know? You have to wait for everyone to respond. For example.

566
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:55,000
And then in a little bit to some quiet types of questions that you would use.

567
01:11:56,950 --> 01:12:02,140
You can use these both in interviews and focus groups direct questions.

568
01:12:03,090 --> 01:12:08,540
So are you happy with the way things went? Or How happy are you?

569
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:15,500
I feel like that's a little leaving, but that's certainly a direct question.

570
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:24,320
An indirect question, which is probably more likely. More often use what most of you think about this intervention.

571
01:12:24,860 --> 01:12:28,490
Tell me more about what you thought about this intervention.

572
01:12:29,260 --> 01:12:36,650
Um, structuring questions. And those are really questions that are used to control the conversation.

573
01:12:37,490 --> 01:12:41,030
So I would like to now move on to a different topic.

574
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:45,680
Another variation of that is I'd like to pivot.

575
01:12:46,040 --> 01:12:50,600
Now we're going to pivot. I'd like to pivot us to blah, blah, blah.

576
01:12:52,850 --> 01:12:58,640
Probing questions are another type of question. And probing is essentially.

577
01:13:00,700 --> 01:13:03,939
When I say I'm packing something, I mean getting more detail.

578
01:13:03,940 --> 01:13:11,350
And so a probing question is a question that allows that you ask to get more detail on something they've said.

579
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:14,110
So could you say some more about that?

580
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:27,610
Or you could, for example, say, you know, a few minutes ago you said that you really liked working with different organizations.

581
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:43,100
Can you tell me more about that? You know our you can also and I'm I really like to use the ignorant observer posture that's what I call it.

582
01:13:43,580 --> 01:13:48,170
So I might say, oh, I don't understand what you mean by that. Can you tell me what you mean by that?

583
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:55,150
Because it plays on people's desire to help.

584
01:13:55,630 --> 01:14:00,760
Acquiescence bias. Event interpreting summarizing questions.

585
01:14:01,180 --> 01:14:06,640
So I hear you saying that you enjoy working with different partners.

586
01:14:08,410 --> 01:14:15,130
Is that fair? Or is that is that, you know, is that a true understanding of what you said?

587
01:14:15,610 --> 01:14:24,270
And so it's really about rephrasing. And then finding out how people respond to that rephrase or rephrase statement.

588
01:14:27,550 --> 01:14:32,140
And there are some planning considerations for interviews setting.

589
01:14:32,950 --> 01:14:40,690
So, you know, it's a little easier to find a space for interviews, but again, you need to have space.

590
01:14:41,410 --> 01:14:45,580
It also helps to be in a space where somebody is comfortable.

591
01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:50,870
And I mean comfortable emotionally, but also physically,

592
01:14:51,290 --> 01:14:57,230
because it's one thing to do an interview and chairs that look like that versus chairs that are couch.

593
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:01,780
So the more comfortable somebody is, the more likely they are to talk.

594
01:15:04,410 --> 01:15:07,690
Interviewers. You really have to think.

595
01:15:07,690 --> 01:15:15,490
About what? What is the potential interaction of a person with the interviewer?

596
01:15:16,090 --> 01:15:19,310
So. And sometimes it helps.

597
01:15:19,710 --> 01:15:28,550
Well, sometimes it helps to have a person who is similar identify like if I a, you know, I'm a black female.

598
01:15:28,550 --> 01:15:33,680
So if we have we're interviewing black women.

599
01:15:35,150 --> 01:15:41,080
In some cases, it might make sense to have a, you know, somebody like me interview that person.

600
01:15:41,830 --> 01:15:49,030
But depending on the topic in might actually make sense to have somebody who isn't part of that same group.

601
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:54,780
And so it just depends. You have to kind of think through that.

602
01:15:55,770 --> 01:16:02,850
That decision are if somebody, for example, more likely to share their perspectives on race,

603
01:16:03,060 --> 01:16:08,130
if they're speaking to somebody who is not part of their community versus is.

604
01:16:10,510 --> 01:16:15,310
Method of recording is similar to focus groups. So you want some you know it.

605
01:16:15,490 --> 01:16:32,030
Ideally it helps to have. Somebody who's asking questions and somebody who's doing notes, which makes it a 2 to 1 interview, which is sometimes okay.

606
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:41,300
I mean, like, if I'm working with staff and I'm trying to capture what they thought about our program, usually having to the one is not a big deal.

607
01:16:41,310 --> 01:16:50,400
But if I'm working with somebody who already is a member of a marginalized community, maybe having two of the one is a little bit intimidating.

608
01:16:50,420 --> 01:16:58,760
So those are choices you have to think through. And then recording is the same way.

609
01:16:58,790 --> 01:17:06,260
Is is recording potentially going to have an impact on what a person says and.

610
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:12,490
In a way that they're not going to want to share with you. They're not going to talk.

611
01:17:15,630 --> 01:17:25,290
And then the questions I've already mentioned. I would still keep it about 8 to 10 questions to make sure you have space for the conversation

612
01:17:25,290 --> 01:17:32,630
to breathe or that for it to open up and for you to be able to ask follow up questions.

613
01:17:36,740 --> 01:17:40,040
Their time and, you know, some limitations of time consuming.

614
01:17:40,310 --> 01:17:46,350
They're expensive. Um. Susceptible to interviewer effects.

615
01:17:48,150 --> 01:17:53,700
And then there is greater flexibility. But that means a more challenging data analysis.

616
01:17:54,490 --> 01:18:01,480
So in the contrast of Focus Group, where you got one transcript, you might have six or seven for every one focus group.

617
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:06,400
Transcript. Depending on, you know, roughly how many people you interview.

618
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:13,210
So that's something to keep in mind. So any questions about interviews?

619
01:18:14,470 --> 01:18:19,000
Yep. Yeah.

620
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:25,680
Now, so a key informant interview is. Basically, the interview is just referring to somebody who.

621
01:18:25,710 --> 01:18:37,860
You're considering a key informant. Yeah. Some people said that.

622
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:48,750
Apparently. Yeah.

623
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:52,810
So in terms of giving questions out beforehand.

624
01:18:52,810 --> 01:19:03,520
So there's kind of two things I consider do I think not giving you the questions is going to negatively impact the interview?

625
01:19:06,140 --> 01:19:17,330
Like, for example. If if I'm asking you about how the program went and I'm asking you for things like what were your goals for the program?

626
01:19:17,990 --> 01:19:24,440
I'm probably just going to give you the questions so that you can prepare to ask those, to answer those.

627
01:19:24,980 --> 01:19:30,740
The other thing is, if you ask for them, if a person asks me for the questions, I'm probably just going to give them the questions.

628
01:19:31,490 --> 01:19:34,790
And I do that because it shows good faith.

629
01:19:35,770 --> 01:19:43,900
And it helps build rapport because, you know, you go into to an interview and you refuse to tell them what you're talking about.

630
01:19:44,260 --> 01:19:50,410
You that creates unnecessary tension, which may impact the amount of information you get.

631
01:19:51,790 --> 01:19:54,940
Yeah. Over there.

632
01:19:55,020 --> 01:19:55,550
Everything.
