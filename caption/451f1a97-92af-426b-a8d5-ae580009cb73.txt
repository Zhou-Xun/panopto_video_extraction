Hello, this is Teresa Roscoe on the EHS five, nine six podcast.

2
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:15,550
My guest today is Lesley Slavitt. Lesley is the managing director of the Boston Society for Architecture.

3
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:20,920
Lesley, would you share a bit about your background? Delighted to thank you Teresa.

4
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:28,210
So I have a doctorate in urban planning, and I've spent about two thirds of my career in corporate philanthropy looking at how we make communities

5
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:38,380
more resilient and sustainable and share economic opportunity across different types of communities.

6
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:43,810
I've also spent the remainder of the career in higher in higher ED, and I'm currently,

7
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:49,460
as you mentioned, managing director of the Boston Society for Architecture.

8
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:53,150
Great, that sounds like a really interesting area to work in right now.

9
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:57,440
When we think about climate change and some of the health, potential health effects,

10
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:03,250
what do you see as some of the dangers that climate poses for the Boston area?

11
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:09,850
Well, they're profound as they are across the world, not just the United States.

12
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:14,710
We have extreme weather events, they're, more intense.

13
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:17,980
The 100 year flood is happening every couple of years.

14
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:26,860
And so the frequency and the intensity of extreme climate is really having a profound effect in terms of the life and well-being of communities,

15
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:33,640
whether that's food sources, whether that's infrastructure, whether that's mass, including mass transportation,

16
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:38,260
whether that's affordable housing and the resiliency, particularly in low lying areas.

17
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:45,490
Boston, is a very old community, particularly by US standards and the infrastructure built more than 100 years ago,

18
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:50,590
is not prepared for what we're seeing at this day and time.

19
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:56,950
Do you see a lot of variation in different parts of the Boston metropolitan area in terms of risk?

20
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:57,730
Well, it's interesting.

21
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:07,090
So, you know, it's really the low lying areas so that, you know, the areas that abut the sort of, you know, coastal areas of Boston.

22
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:15,490
And so it's not just the city of Boston itself, but it's really a regional issue up and down the coast of those communities.

23
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:24,790
And so it's really the low lying areas that have the most exposure and the most profound concerns related to climate change,

24
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:30,960
particularly an adaptation to changes in water and coastal resilience.

25
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:37,520
Are there any particular communities or groups of people that are at greater risk based on where they live?

26
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:47,030
Oh, look, you know, those people obviously living in those coastal areas, you know, when you think about resiliency and you think about adaptation,

27
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:52,970
you also think about those people in those communities that have historically been disenfranchized

28
00:02:52,970 --> 00:03:01,070
and have less access to opportunities to relocate, to make improvements to their homes.

29
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:08,930
If you look at homeownership rates and the interest people have with the improvements they

30
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:12,710
can make in their own homes versus the improvements that landlords are willing to make.

31
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:15,950
And obviously, you know, housing is exceedingly expensive.

32
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:23,930
Affordable housing is it is a challenge across the United States is incredibly difficult and profound problem in Boston.

33
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:31,610
And so you have this intensity of these layers of issues, particularly with communities that have historically been,

34
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:40,790
you know, sort of pushed to or been redlined into areas where the land has less economic value over time.

35
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:45,380
And are there currently any actions being taken or things being done in the

36
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:50,120
Boston area to prevent or mitigate some of the risks for those populations?

37
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:54,290
You know, absolutely. And though it's not just happening today.

38
00:03:54,290 --> 00:04:00,860
It sort of seems like yesterday wasn't that far away when these issues really began to be looked at and addressed.

39
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:03,200
And it's complicated and it's messy.

40
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:10,710
And people have different levels of experience, different opportunities to have voice and different ability to sort of make change.

41
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:19,430
And so certainly the city of Boston from a public policy and zoning perspective has been looking at these issues and has been looking at different

42
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:29,180
ways to plan for it to incorporate the necessity of living with water into the way the Boston Department of Planning and Development operates.

43
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:32,900
And also, it's become something that's been necessary to look at regionally, right?

44
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:36,620
Because, you know, municipal boundaries sort of with that municipal line.

45
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:41,780
But you know, water and the necessity of living with water crosses those boundaries.

46
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:46,160
And so I think increasingly looking at a regional perspective is something that's

47
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:51,590
necessary in testing and seeing and understanding what solutions can really make change,

48
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:57,290
right? And so when you have vulnerability to water, you know, you sort of have two options that are being looked at.

49
00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:06,680
One is try to keep the water out with things like levees and barriers or try to raise the land so that it's less prone to flooding.

50
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:12,200
And so as people are grappling with those sort of different perspectives and different approaches,

51
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:21,950
while I think really community activists and voices really being raised up and empowered to try to understand the implications for their homes,

52
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:30,500
for their communities, for their neighborhoods and their role as critical stakeholders to having voice of the decision made over where they live,

53
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:37,370
where their homes are, and how to bring these multidimensional stakeholders together to make good decisions over time.

54
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:41,900
And of course, infrastructure is an incredibly expensive investment.

55
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:49,130
And looking at how to make those wise wisely and thoughtfully while improving the quality of life and economic opportunity for those

56
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:58,150
traditionally most disenfranchized is something that's really been increasingly an important part of the conversation in Boston.

57
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:58,540
Thank you,

58
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:05,440
I'm so glad to hear you talk a little bit about engagement of those community members to ensure that they're not left behind in the conversations

59
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:14,110
and that they can actively participate in what some of these these efforts are to kind of mitigate the possible damage that could affect them.

60
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:21,820
This has been a really great conversation. I so appreciate you coming on our podcast today and look forward to some future conversations.

61
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:25,750
Thank you so much. My pleasure. Thank you, Teresa. Thanks.

62
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:33,921
Bye bye. Bye bye.
