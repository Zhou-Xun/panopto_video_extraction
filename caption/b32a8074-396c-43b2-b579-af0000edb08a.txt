1
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:26,490
And then he gets on the boat to do because they've just been forced to make such.

2
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:43,110
If you like. You look no further than that.

3
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:53,310
Yeah, there's a lot of demand for it out there.

4
00:00:53,610 --> 00:01:02,850
Like, I'm going to maybe just take that one for the property.

5
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:11,870
And I just got very excited is to look out for you.

6
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:21,180
I drove around. You have a cheeseburger. If I do that, you'll have an extra incentive.

7
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:28,350
Easier and full of hope and excitement.

8
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:33,749
Yeah. Yeah. Good morning, everyone.

9
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:41,070
For this week's post, our search.

10
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:50,530
Anyhow. It's cold in here this morning.

11
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:55,090
Are you cold? I am cold to regulate the temperature.

12
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:03,970
So just one announcement before you start today.

13
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:16,540
The twins number ten will drop on Friday afternoon and it will cover the last two lectures, this one and the previous lecture on Natural.

14
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:23,890
Well, today we're going to talk about cardiovascular disease and obesity.

15
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:26,080
And here are the learning objectives.

16
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:33,790
I would like you to be able to describe the relationship between my dominant possibly and cardiovascular disease.

17
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:39,820
Describe the mechanism by which obese increases the risk of cardiovascular disease.

18
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:47,800
Describe the impact of obesity and the risk of of other types of heart diseases such as arrhythmia,

19
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:57,040
heart failure, left ventricular hypertrophy, stroke, twice the ability to explain that obesity paradox.

20
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,400
This is the or I should probably say of my paradox.

21
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:07,720
This is this phenomenon in which people in some of these studies have been looked at retrospectively.

22
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:15,580
People with a higher BMI seem to have a greater survival after they've been diagnosed with heart failure.

23
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:29,559
We'll go over that for. And then again, the metabolically healthy obesity is not a stable condition in regard to cardiovascular disease events.

24
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:37,450
And I thought that a little bit from the Whitehall study and then there's one last slide on bariatric

25
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:43,840
surgery at risk of coronary heart disease that we'll talk about at the very end of the lecture.

26
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:52,440
So we've seen graphs like this and they have similar shapes.

27
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:59,460
They're J-shaped or U-shaped, depending on the cohort study that is used.

28
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:08,370
This is a study showing showing you men and women relative risk of death.

29
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:11,730
And the relative risk of death is from cardiovascular disease.

30
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:17,310
Cancer of heart is the difference between the lines here.

31
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:29,210
So all cause it's this heavy line decline that's underlying cardiovascular disease is this dotted line and then cancer has this dashed line.

32
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:34,890
And for men and women, you see a little bit of a difference in the relationship here.

33
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:43,260
Now, in this particular study, this is a this is a very large study that the details are listed down here.

34
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:50,730
So you had a million adults in the U.S. and during the time a follow up period of 14 years,

35
00:04:51,420 --> 00:05:01,739
they're looking at the causes of death here and they're relating that's relevant to these different causes based on the BMI index.

36
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:08,709
And notice how they set the the value here for the for the control.

37
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:15,750
They're the reference category, rather, between 23.5 and 24.9 BMI index.

38
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:23,070
And for men, we noticed that there is a decrease as we go up the BMI scale.

39
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:29,540
And for cardiovascular disease shown here, definitely cardiovascular disease.

40
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:40,900
And for women, you don't see the same type of a steep incline with body mass index and death from cardiovascular disease.

41
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:43,040
You a little bit of a different shape here.

42
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:52,250
There seems to be more of a uptick when we go below the reference value and if individuals and particularly for women.

43
00:05:54,130 --> 00:06:00,790
So you've seen these types of relationships before, and they're repeated over and over again a number of times.

44
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:09,190
And again, this is a this is a this is a longitudinal study based on this in this particular case, a 14 year follow up.

45
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:16,840
So what what other studies have been done here that are famous for this relationship where

46
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:22,210
there's this monster heart study that was done in Germany and the monster heart study,

47
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:30,520
they followed people. That is a cohort of people falling between 1979 and 1991.

48
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:37,760
You know, we're looking for risk factors for cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular

49
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:43,880
events and women at work so that assessments were done at their place of work.

50
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,180
So they were able to follow these people up for a long period of time.

51
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:53,000
And this what this did is it increased the retention of people in this particular cohort.

52
00:06:54,440 --> 00:07:05,450
And they looked for cardiovascular events like myocardial infarction, stroke or just mortality from cardiovascular disease.

53
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:17,960
And in this particular study, they were able to show a graded relationship between BMI, H total serum cholesterol,

54
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:25,160
LDL cholesterol, systolic and diastolic blood pressure and markers of inflammation and thrombosis.

55
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:33,320
And they could in terms of the association between BMI and coronary heart disease,

56
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:38,990
it could be completely accounted for by these risk factors that they've mentioned here.

57
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:49,850
So it was these risk factors that were elevated that was thought to be the primary cause of cardiovascular disease in these individuals.

58
00:07:53,370 --> 00:08:04,520
So when you take a closer look at these risk factors, I find that they have a significant modifying effect on these cardiovascular outcomes.

59
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:11,320
This is another study that included 21 different cohort studies.

60
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:18,500
So they're following people longitudinally and within this group of 300,000 people.

61
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:27,080
And they're in this case, they're looking at the association between overweight and they concluded individuals who would be in the obesity category,

62
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:35,720
and they're looking at the increase of coronary heart disease. And here in this study,

63
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:40,520
they're going to control for these risk factors that I mentioned here and trying to

64
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:46,400
determine what contribution that had to the risk of cardiovascular disease outcomes.

65
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:54,320
So this is a table that shows you the relative risks of coronary heart disease for people

66
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,450
who were moderately overweight or in the obvious category compared with normal weight,

67
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:03,200
with and without adjustments for blood pressure and cholesterol.

68
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:13,610
So they're looking here at the relative risk of moderate overweight in terms of these cardiovascular disease outcomes.

69
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:19,670
And they find this significant relationship for moderate overweight.

70
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:29,750
When they look at people who have this BMI a little over 30 and over this relationship, is this a bit stronger and more significant?

71
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:35,990
The top portion is adjusted for age, sex, physical activity and smoking.

72
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,829
Look what happens when they control for factors,

73
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:47,930
risk factors that are known to contribute to an increased incidence of cardiovascular disease, blood pressure and cholesterol.

74
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:54,440
So with moderate overweight, yes, there's this significant increase.

75
00:09:55,010 --> 00:10:03,380
But the effect is much, much smaller. Actually, it's it's it's actually you after you make these adjustments, it's no longer significant.

76
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:11,030
And when you look at that BMI of 30 and over category, it's it's less significant.

77
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:16,970
So all studies, they're showing a significant effect with people who live 30 and over.

78
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:24,470
What do you control for blood pressure and cholesterol? You don't see this same relationship.

79
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:33,380
So it's these risk factors that are associated with excess adiposity that are contributing to this increase of cardiovascular disease.

80
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:43,970
You can have a normal BMI, but if you have your risk factors and elevated blood pressure blood lipids,

81
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:48,950
it's going to significantly contribute to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.

82
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:55,870
So. Those are studies looking at BMI.

83
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:02,890
I've shown you this relationship or this graph before in a previous lecture.

84
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:12,160
And in this particular study, they're looking at coronary heart disease in men, and there's a higher risk for cardiovascular disease in women.

85
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:24,070
And they're looking at BMI and waist to shift ratio as red represent I and the blue bars represent

86
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:32,020
this waist hip ratio relationship and looking at coronary heart disease per 1000 people.

87
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:38,080
And the categories here are broken down to low, medium, high and highest.

88
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:47,260
You see a more of a linear relationship between waist to hip ratio of coronary heart disease.

89
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:50,230
That's compared with BMI,

90
00:11:50,230 --> 00:12:00,040
which gives you kind of this j-shaped pattern where it's elevated at low BMI and then it increases as you go up the BMI scale.

91
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:10,450
So the waist hip issue or waist circumference is going to be a much better predictor of cardiovascular disease risk than BMI.

92
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:17,260
What about race and ethnicity and heart disease?

93
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:23,710
This is a study that I just found on the Center for Disease Control website,

94
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:33,340
and it gives you deaths per 1000 persons from cardiovascular disease, from heart disease, I should say.

95
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:36,880
And in the green line, we have black non-Hispanic.

96
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:43,510
That's Gold Line, white, non-Hispanic, followed by Hispanic and Asian Pacific Islanders.

97
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:52,780
We noticed that there say the deaths per 100,000 persons and that this racial group affects is higher than all of the rest.

98
00:12:53,650 --> 00:13:04,460
But over time, since 1999, we see a decrease in the numbers of individuals per 100,000 that are dying from cardiovascular.

99
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:14,280
So racial disparities due to lots of socioeconomic factors.

100
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:23,580
Racial prejudice. Lots of things that can affect this relationship.

101
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:36,980
Why is it declining? The decline in cardiovascular disease deaths has been attributed to the use of statin drugs drugs that lower LDL cholesterol.

102
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:46,220
Do you have a figure for you showing that relationship to see that the second or the last on the slide in the top?

103
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:52,610
So overall, the number of people dying from cardiovascular disease has gone down.

104
00:13:53,290 --> 00:14:01,160
There are significant racial disparities in regard to people dying from cardiovascular disease due to a number of reasons.

105
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:10,690
The science, some of the things that are already mentioned. So let's talk about what's going on in the heart and cardiovascular disease.

106
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:16,280
The first bit of today's lecture is going to focus on atherosclerosis.

107
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:31,100
So here you have an image of the heart and here's the anterior descending cardiac artery, and it has these branches off of this main artery.

108
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:37,270
And usually you see the blockage forming close to or right at the branch.

109
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:43,850
And this represents an area that you're going to find more atherosclerosis occurring.

110
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:53,870
And that's because the low characteristics of blood going through these vessels at these different points, the bifurcation changes a little bit.

111
00:14:54,440 --> 00:15:04,490
And it's these are areas that are impacted by the low density cholesterol particles that can get inside of the arterial wall.

112
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:19,910
So with atherosclerosis, you're having a buildup or a fatty streak that occurs within the vasculature, and this occurs to a greater extent as we age.

113
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:33,740
It occurs due to elevations and LDL cholesterol, triglycerides and your inability to safely store lipids and adipose tissue.

114
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:43,700
So the other thing that can occur besides the blockage of flow here is in this case,

115
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:49,010
you see the brown tissue that's downstream from this particular blockage.

116
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:52,940
And what you're seeing here is ischemia occurring.

117
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:58,099
So there's not enough blood available to perfused this tissue adequately.

118
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:02,379
So the heart undergoes cell death.

119
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:08,090
That's the population of muscle cells within this region, start to die off as a consequence of this.

120
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:14,750
And it can this large area can completely restart of oxygen through a blockage of this vessel.

121
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:24,470
So here you have some platelets now that have been forming a clot here in front of this blockage,

122
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:30,530
this fatty streak, causing ischemia and a myocardial infarction.

123
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:36,169
So a lot of things are going on here.

124
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:41,570
And let's take a closer look of this next slide.

125
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:43,250
We'll take a closer look at this.

126
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:52,340
And I put this in kind of this morning to alert you to what's going on in terms of what the role of the deficits are in vascular function.

127
00:16:53,300 --> 00:17:01,129
So this is part of your reading and this information that we've gotten in terms of how the different

128
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:07,520
adipose tissue deposits could contribute to cardiovascular disease is evolving and changing all the time.

129
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:18,170
So in this particular figure, you have remote starting here on endocrine signaling here in a remote adipose tissue post.

130
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:27,500
And the one that is talked to, talked about most frequently in cardiovascular disease is the visceral compartment.

131
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:32,749
So if there's an expansion of the visceral compartment,

132
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:43,670
it's suggested that that would indicate that you can't store this triglycerides in the subcutaneous compartment well enough.

133
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:58,700
And as a consequence, the visceral compartment expands and you have a greater tendency to not store rice and free fatty acids safely,

134
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:09,709
and then they can circulate. You have the collaboration of mediators from the adipose tissue depots and

135
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:16,670
they circulate in the blood and they affect the heart and the arterial wall,

136
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:21,740
different kinds of lipid factors.

137
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:28,790
The paper also mentioned a number of things that can travel to different regions of the body,

138
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:35,390
and the cells are microRNA, for example, that can affect vascular function.

139
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:43,250
This next section of this figure is the pair signaling that would occur around the artery.

140
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:53,119
And we're learning a lot more about this vascular adipose tissue and how it can regulate, regulate vascular function.

141
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,290
And that's what's shown here.

142
00:18:55,460 --> 00:19:09,590
So here you have adipocytes that are around the arterial wall and the vasculature that perfused this tissue can extend into the arterial

143
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:22,580
wall and anything that is produced within this compartment can drain into the arterial wall and affect the function of this artery.

144
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:36,020
So there are a number of factors that were mentioned here that could affect the tone of this blood vessel, its capacity to dilate or constrict.

145
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:45,139
So you have elements that are released into the vasculature that can affect signaling

146
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:51,920
events within the blood vessels that control phase of dilation and constriction.

147
00:19:53,270 --> 00:20:04,200
And there's been an awful lot of interest in this type of cardio of adipose tissue before this that was mentioned within the paper.

148
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:10,790
So you have a layer of adipose tissue that sits directly above the heart muscle itself.

149
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:24,590
And beneath that pericardium, this adipose tissue, it can also be a source of adipocytes and hormones and lipid mediators and then the songs as well.

150
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:28,160
And it can have direct effects on the heart muscle itself.

151
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:36,920
So there's there's a lot of interest in this area and it's an intensive area of research now.

152
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:47,780
So getting back to atherosclerosis, this particular figure relates to the flow of blood through the vasculature.

153
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:53,720
So in a normal artery where you have this, you don't have any body build up here.

154
00:20:54,650 --> 00:21:02,030
There's a flow of blood through this that that allows tissues to be perfused adequately.

155
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:11,480
But as plaque builds up in the arterial wall, not only kind of reduces the flow of blood to the muscle in the heart,

156
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:16,370
but it can change the flow characteristics of the blood.

157
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:25,700
And when that happens, you have a greater tendency to have coagulation occurring through activation of platelets.

158
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:32,490
So this is another event that can occur as a consequence of this fatty tissue that.

159
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:40,990
This is another view of this process of atherosclerosis.

160
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:50,640
In this time, we're looking at the formation of the fatty streak and how it can be disrupted and cause a myocardial infarction.

161
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:57,660
So on the very top of the figure, we see the different layers within the artery from the outside.

162
00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:05,610
The advantage that you have, that the media layer, which is composed of smooth muscle into the layer and the endothelium,

163
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:22,620
and you have LDL cholesterol that can deposit within the it's in the layer and forming this fatty streak that you see here.

164
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:33,490
And this fatty streak formation distorts the shape of the artery and reduces the size of the limiter, the diameter of the artery.

165
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:42,970
And as that fatty streak develops, it can form right up close to the endothelium.

166
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:53,230
Shown here. And this structure here is less robust than the normal structure of the vasculature.

167
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:57,820
It's vulnerable. It can break away.

168
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:07,870
It can be disrupted. And it can lodge into smaller vessels, vessels downstream, causing a heart attack or a myocardial infarction.

169
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:17,350
So that's what's shown here in this particular section of the figure of plaque rupture and thrombosis occurring here.

170
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:27,010
And after this structure, it's rupture keels.

171
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:32,910
You notice that the moment here, it's even smaller after this is occurred.

172
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:44,910
So there can be resolution of the plaque, but the diameter of the vasculature is much reduced compared to a healthy artery.

173
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:50,310
Now, that didn't have this flag.

174
00:23:52,510 --> 00:24:06,820
So the the structure of the the fatty Clark can contain lipids, it'll contain immune cells, it'll contain some calcification within the artery.

175
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:13,480
And so this is a complex structure within the fatty streak.

176
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:20,860
She Did you have a comment or a question I'm glad to say is behind interestingly, yes.

177
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:32,760
And when the merger approached, was that. Suicide is so successful it can be fit inside the vessel.

178
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:38,850
Yes. Yes. And where is the calcium positive calcium deposits.

179
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:43,740
That's associated with within the fatty streak itself.

180
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:56,940
Yes. Thank you. So in terms of of other risk factors, I'm mentioned here.

181
00:24:56,950 --> 00:25:07,200
So most people are, I should say 47% of Americans adults have one of three key risk factors hypertension, elevated cholesterol,

182
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:18,540
LDL cholesterol, cigaret smoking rates have gone down but are still at around 1916 to 19% of the adult population still smokes.

183
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:26,070
So significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease, smoke oxidizes, the LDL cholesterol,

184
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:36,299
making it more prone to form a series or a greater risk and have a greater tendency to

185
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:44,640
have problems with containing triglycerides safely in the subcutaneous compartment.

186
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:55,440
And as a consequence, we see more lipid abnormalities in men that limit a family history of cardiovascular disease.

187
00:25:56,100 --> 00:26:00,570
It's a significant factor here, but this is a modifiable risk.

188
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:06,900
If you have a healthy diet and have physical activity, this can reduce this risk.

189
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:14,160
Physical inactivity is a risk factor for heart disease as well.

190
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:22,109
So people who don't engage in at least 30 minutes of modest physical activity five days

191
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:30,880
a week for 30 minutes are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes.

192
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:41,100
I believe I gave you that figure. Six out of ten people who have diabetes also have cardiovascular disease.

193
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:47,160
So this is a very important risk factor for vascular disease.

194
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:53,280
So what's going on inside inside the body? I have a question about the family.

195
00:26:53,640 --> 00:27:02,130
Yes. You said that's modifiable. But I mean, is that something modifiable like cigaret smoking or is family history?

196
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:09,210
You can't. So if you have the example here would have to do with.

197
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:15,480
So if you have a family history of cardiovascular disease and you increase your physical activity.

198
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:29,790
Right. Right. And you have a you have a greater ability to expend energy and are more physically active.

199
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:34,830
This can reduce your risk of having a cardiovascular disease event earlier in life.

200
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:40,200
So the modifiable modifiable component in this class is physical activity.

201
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:48,900
So if you had somebody the same risk, people who are inactive versus people who are active.

202
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:53,670
Unhealthy diet, healthy diet, excess adiposity.

203
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:00,120
Those people are going to have a higher risk even though they have the same genetic background.

204
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:04,379
So it's that other risk factors that you can change that are modifiable,

205
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:11,160
that can instead of having a significant event at 49 years old, it might occur much later in life.

206
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:22,469
You still at an elevated risk. So the example is if you have illegal hypercholesterolemia, those people are going to be treated with statin drugs now.

207
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:28,350
And that's what reduces has the most important impact on reducing your risk of cardiovascular events so

208
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:35,130
drugs can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease in people who are genetically predisposed as well.

209
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:41,260
So in that way, it's modifiable. You're not modifying the genotype, right?

210
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:50,060
So what's going on in terms of the static stream formation?

211
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:53,330
Well, it's a complex event,

212
00:28:53,720 --> 00:29:07,310
a set of events that occur and how the lipids get there and how they expand and form this amount of tissue within the arterial wall.

213
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:15,680
So one of the first events that occurs is the oxidized lipoproteins,

214
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:26,660
low density lipoproteins that are found within the vasculature, and you have in circulation a number of different immune cells.

215
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:31,280
And the one that is the focus of research in this area is the monocyte.

216
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:37,759
The monocytes circulate in your blood and you have different types of monocytes.

217
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:42,470
You have some that express different adhesion molecules.

218
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:53,360
And so it's the one that expresses this particular type or set of adhesion molecules that are more likely to be found within the arterial wall.

219
00:29:54,800 --> 00:30:01,850
So we've learned a lot about this through studying atherosclerosis, development in mice and other types of animal models.

220
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:14,600
So traveling along the epithelial layer here, you have a monocytes and it first binds to the endothelial cells through these types of interactions.

221
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:22,190
So you have a receptor expressed by the MONOCYTE and by the end of Celia's cell and in an inflammatory environment,

222
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:27,470
you have an upregulation of these receptors both in the monocytes and in the end of the earlier layer.

223
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:35,720
And this slows down a lot of site as it gets into the vasculature within the arterial tree.

224
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:46,010
The second event that occurs is adhesion to these other types of molecules that mediate

225
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:52,550
the diabetes or the movement of the monocyte from the vasculature into the arterial wall.

226
00:30:54,020 --> 00:31:08,089
And so here's the monocyte. After it's gotten into the underneath the endothelial layer and it's attracted there because it is responding

227
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:16,820
to human tactic signals produced within the arterial wall and you have oxidized LDL particles here as well.

228
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:26,690
The monocytes become bone cells by taking up these oxidized LDL particles.

229
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:37,810
Now the oxidation occurs from the production of reactive oxygen species that LDL can be oxidized by cigaret, smoke and so on.

230
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:44,870
So these particles are avidly taken up by the monocytes that's gotten into the arterial wall.

231
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:51,060
And it forms these this foam cell, the foam cell itself.

232
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:57,530
It's not a passive and it's these cells can produce pro-inflammatory cytokines.

233
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:07,250
They can produce chemokines that attract other monocytes into the arterial wall,

234
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:15,319
and they can express molecules that maintain that cell within the arterial wall.

235
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:24,300
So it stays there. And over time, those cells build up, they die, they undergo a tells us.

236
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:31,849
And what remains is the lipid and danger associated molecular patterns from the

237
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:35,990
death of these cells that contribute to more inflammation in the arteries.

238
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:46,970
And over several years, as these cells filled up, they attract more monocytes, other types of immune cells, and the fatty streak continues to grow.

239
00:32:49,730 --> 00:33:01,940
So what's going on in terms of the adipose tissue, the very vascular adipose tissue and this fatty acid fatty streak within the arterial wall?

240
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:06,500
So there's a two way communication here going on.

241
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:20,959
So you have within the outside of the blood vessel, here's the true vascular adipose tissue producing gasses, messengers, hydrogen, hydrogen sulfide.

242
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:25,370
You have nitric oxide, you have reactive oxygen species,

243
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:34,370
you have microparticles that can get into the arterial wall and contribute to the growth of this fatty streak.

244
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,210
And then here are some of the cells that I told you about.

245
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:49,100
You have proliferation of the smooth muscle that can contribute to the size of the fatty stream, this this kind of as well.

246
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:56,750
So there are a number of things that are getting to this fatty streak that contribute to its growth and its development.

247
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:03,470
You have reactive oxygen species formed by the energy oxidase.

248
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:12,350
You have nitric oxide, which is normally helpful in terms of allowing the vessel to expand.

249
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:20,299
But here you have an uncoupled effect on uncoupling effect.

250
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:27,230
In other words, instead of producing nitric oxide, you're producing more reactive oxygen species.

251
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:40,970
Within this particular area, the macrophages become the classically activated phenotype here that produce more pro-inflammatory cytokines.

252
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:51,469
And then, as I mentioned, you've got you get this smooth muscle proliferation here and then more monocytes being attracted

253
00:34:51,470 --> 00:35:01,010
to the fatty regime and then a number of things occurring that can affect vascular tone.

254
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:12,350
I know the regulation of basal constrictors affecting calcium channel of potassium channels and then you

255
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:19,130
have local regulation by the renin angiotensin astronaut system causing some phase of constriction here.

256
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:25,850
So the foam cell can also release things that can signal outside of the vasculature.

257
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:34,940
So there's this bi directional interplay between what's going on and the fatty acid streak and what's going on in the vascular adipose tissue.

258
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:49,740
So this is a list of physiological metabolic changes associated with having excess adiposity that contribute to cardiovascular disease risk.

259
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:53,970
So it's some resistance and hyperinsulinemia.

260
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:58,730
That's insensitivity and hyper left anemia.

261
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:15,479
So within the frame you become less sensitive to let within immune cells and within other tissues you have a different relationship.

262
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:18,420
In other words, the evidence for leptin,

263
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:28,080
insensitivity in immune cells and let's say an increase are the effect of leptin on the sympathetic nervous system is less so.

264
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:37,920
In other words, you may be insensitive to leptin in terms of hunger and appetite, its ability to reduce appetite.

265
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:47,550
But leptin can still increase sympathetic nervous system activity and activation of immune cells during the development of cardiovascular disease.

266
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:50,669
Do to connect.

267
00:36:50,670 --> 00:37:02,460
And so remember it did the acting was that it did a kind that has favorable effects in terms of metabolic function and insulin sensitivity.

268
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:13,920
It is protective in cardiovascular disease development by down regulating monocyte activation, preventing foam cell formation.

269
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:19,320
These the levels of it are reduced and excess adiposity.

270
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:24,990
The metabolic syndrome. This is certainly a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.

271
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:28,110
And we talked about that as well as type two diabetes.

272
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:33,480
And then importantly, having a pathogenic lipids profile.

273
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:44,290
Some other things systemic inflammation, increased sympathetic nervous system activation,

274
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:53,440
increased renin angiotensin aldosterone system and endothelial dysfunction.

275
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:56,620
So in regard to endothelial dysfunction,

276
00:37:56,620 --> 00:38:07,810
we're talking about the loss of and ability of the vasculature to highlight in response to vasodilators signals or for of a

277
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:18,850
stricter type of response mediated in part by an elevation of the ceiling one as a consequence of having excess adiposity.

278
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:23,650
So all of these things can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.

279
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:29,050
Did you see any kind of activity? Sympathetic nervous system?

280
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:45,340
Okay. So that was atherosclerosis in regard to having excess adiposity.

281
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:53,770
What about other types of heart disease? This particular figure looks at the probability of atrial fibrillation.

282
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:56,890
This is a type of arrhythmia that occurs in the atria.

283
00:38:57,610 --> 00:39:06,459
And we're looking at individuals with, again, using BMI as a measure for adiposity here.

284
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:14,770
And we're looking at years of time and we're looking at the probability of atrial fibrillation in the different BMI categories.

285
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:22,210
And with men in particular, we see a greater probability of atrial fibrillation.

286
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:30,610
We do see an increase in women, but this increase is not as great as what we've seen compared to that.

287
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:36,129
The norm, the so-called normal BMI in the different categories is different.

288
00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:41,860
Again, men are more likely to have cardiovascular disease in women.

289
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:51,100
So the effect of higher BMI and the probability of hope relation, you see a much greater tick here than what you see in women.

290
00:39:51,280 --> 00:40:00,820
But in all cases, we see a greater risk as we we go up the BMI scale from overweight or obese, particularly men who have obesity.

291
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:10,930
So in regard to obesity and arrhythmia, there are several risk factors.

292
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:16,630
So left ventricle, high ventricular hypertrophy is more common in obesity.

293
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:20,650
And this probably relates to peripheral vascular resistance.

294
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:34,989
And as a consequence, you get a beginning of the left ventricle and this in itself can contribute to a greater risk of Parisian heart disease is

295
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:43,719
another trigger for arrhythmia do occur and this occurs in response to ischemia that can occur from narrowing of the arteries.

296
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:50,799
And this can increase arrhythmia, increase sympathetic nerve activity.

297
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:54,090
And leptin has been shown to directly affect this.

298
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:59,050
So if you have more out of passive that you have more leptin, you have greater sympathetic nerve activity.

299
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:03,970
And this can increase risk of arrhythmia, which increases heart rate.

300
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:12,670
A prolonged interval has to do with the relaxation of the heart muscle after the event.

301
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:21,250
Ventricles attract contract. And I have a subsequent slide that describes this relationship in much better detail.

302
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:29,169
Obstructive sleep apnea. So we're going to talk about that in great detail on Monday.

303
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:33,400
But when you have somebody who has obstructive sleep apnea,

304
00:41:35,350 --> 00:41:48,190
their ability to breathe while they sleep is significantly compromised to the point where they can have several APNIC events while they're asleep.

305
00:41:49,270 --> 00:42:00,700
So they're breathing against the closed airway, and that builds up a lot of pressure and increases blood pressure in.

306
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:06,070
And it's this very profound activation of the sympathetic nervous system as well.

307
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:14,650
So not only do these people get more sleep, but it's a lower activation of the sympathetic nervous system.

308
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:17,470
And this has been shown to increase the risk of.

309
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:33,740
And there are some studies looking at lifestyle intervention and looking at weight loss and its relation to atrial fibrillation.

310
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:43,280
And it's been shown in people who have arrhythmia and have excess adiposity that after they go through a lifestyle modification,

311
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:50,510
they can't they've been found to have a reduction in atrial fibrillation.

312
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:59,740
So let me walk you through the normal heart rhythm and we'll talk about some different kinds of arrhythmias.

313
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:07,620
So here's a cross-section of the heart, and this is in the intrinsic conduction system of the heart.

314
00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:12,130
What we have starting out here with the sign of atrial note or S.A. note,

315
00:43:12,430 --> 00:43:21,190
and this is where you have the initiation of the electrical impulses that cause contraction, different regions of the heart.

316
00:43:22,510 --> 00:43:26,560
So it's not atrial load, it's activated.

317
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:38,950
It has branches coming off of the same note that innervate the atria they contract in response to this.

318
00:43:39,430 --> 00:43:49,120
And then you have this other note the the A.V. Node or the atrium ventricular node, which takes these impulses.

319
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:52,960
And there's a bit of a delay between the contraction of the atria and the ventricle,

320
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:59,560
and this signal travels down the bundle branches within the set here,

321
00:43:59,950 --> 00:44:07,540
and then they diverge it to the potentially fibers that innervate to extend ventricles the heart.

322
00:44:08,770 --> 00:44:13,209
And if you were to record the electrical impulses that occurs,

323
00:44:13,210 --> 00:44:18,430
you would see a tracing that looks like this or like this depending on where you have two leads.

324
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:27,670
So you have a a curve here that represents different electrical impulses.

325
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:36,220
The first is this P wave, the smaller little hump here, and then you have the q r s t complex.

326
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:50,650
Then you have this, you are T and then you have this q this this additional wave that occurs indicating the different electrical

327
00:44:50,650 --> 00:44:56,650
events that occur in the heart so that you get a p wave right before you get the atrial contracting.

328
00:44:57,220 --> 00:45:06,459
You get this curious q r s complex when the ventricles contract right before the ventricles contract and then you get this T wave,

329
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:10,600
which is that represents repolarization within the ventricle.

330
00:45:11,410 --> 00:45:17,680
So this is the normal rhythm that would occur. What happens in atrial fibrillation?

331
00:45:18,010 --> 00:45:29,200
Well, instead of having one p wave here, you see lots of waves crying before the q is complex.

332
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:37,080
So there is an elevated rhythm that affects the contraction of the space.

333
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:47,830
Signals are affecting the contraction of the atria and instead of the yes, a node controlling the rhythm within the atria,

334
00:45:48,190 --> 00:45:56,440
you have different sites within the atria that are being activated and causing the contraction of the atrial muscle.

335
00:45:58,390 --> 00:46:03,130
And instead of having one p wave, you're having several of these.

336
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:08,170
And this can affect the flow of blood within the atria.

337
00:46:08,710 --> 00:46:16,330
And you have an increased risk of forming a blood clot as a consequence of having atrial arrhythmia

338
00:46:16,870 --> 00:46:23,350
so that blood clot can travel to the vasculature anywhere in the body and it can cause a stroke.

339
00:46:24,130 --> 00:46:32,709
So people who have atrial fibrillation are put on drugs to control this, first of all, and then to control the clotting.

340
00:46:32,710 --> 00:46:41,770
So they'll be blood thinners if they do form a clot as a consequence of these events, reduces the risk of having a stroke.

341
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:51,940
So this is what occurs in atrial fibrillation with the long shooting syndrome.

342
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:59,470
So here's the normal tracing here. They're not showing very much of a risk to complex anyhow.

343
00:47:00,010 --> 00:47:05,110
Here's this the distance between the normal acute interval.

344
00:47:05,470 --> 00:47:12,190
So that's what's shown here. The screen boxes for long for abnormal acuity interval.

345
00:47:12,310 --> 00:47:22,570
There's this greater spacing here. So it takes a longer period of time now for the repolarization of the ventricles to occur.

346
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:35,800
And because of that time period, it's a little bit longer that can increase the risk of ventricular tachycardia.

347
00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:43,089
So in that instance, the signals that would normally arise from the SCA,

348
00:47:43,090 --> 00:47:51,640
not because of this delay you get activation of places within the ventricles to activate the.

349
00:47:52,160 --> 00:48:01,670
Contraction of the electrical impulses travels through the heart, causing this normal contraction in the form of tachycardia.

350
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:09,560
So this is associated with increased sympathetic nerve activity and electrolyte imbalances.

351
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:13,380
All of these things can cause this long, acute syndromes.

352
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:22,340
So if you have this long acute syndrome, it puts you at a greater risk for this unstable ventricular arrhythmia.

353
00:48:22,970 --> 00:48:29,810
So ventricular arrhythmia or tachycardia is shown here where you get a rapid heartbeat

354
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:35,090
that's initiated with the ventricles instead of the same note in the atria.

355
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:40,040
So somebody who has this condition would have a rapid resting heart rate.

356
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:46,400
Again, the rhythm is initiated in the ventricles instead of the atria.

357
00:48:48,020 --> 00:48:56,319
And somebody who has ventricular arrhythmias might have a really high heartbeat, 160 to 240 points per minute.

358
00:48:56,320 --> 00:49:03,980
And this is way above normal. And this sequence of events can cause sudden cardiac death.

359
00:49:06,590 --> 00:49:16,819
So this is a very serious condition. If you people are some people who have a high risk factors may be monitored for their the heart rhythm.

360
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:22,490
They might wear a monitor if they're suspected to have an abnormal heart rhythm.

361
00:49:23,090 --> 00:49:38,930
And if they find that they have a pre ventricular contraction or ventricular tachycardia, they would be put on an medication to control this.

362
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:47,809
So if you have these events occurring and a number of events in a row,

363
00:49:47,810 --> 00:49:55,490
so you have this activation of this rhythm 3 to 3, four or five times, and then you go to a normal rhythm.

364
00:49:55,880 --> 00:50:02,720
Once you get to a six of these types of events or ocular contractions that occur in the row, in a row,

365
00:50:04,030 --> 00:50:11,930
it significantly increases your risk of having tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia and then sudden cardiac death.

366
00:50:12,350 --> 00:50:15,830
So this is a very serious sequence of events.

367
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:23,970
So what happens in left ventricular hypertrophy?

368
00:50:24,790 --> 00:50:29,180
Well, your heart is working against an increase in peripheral vascular resistance.

369
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:31,350
So here's the normal heart shown here.

370
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:39,090
And you can see that left ventricle is thicker than the right ventricle because it's pushing against greater resistance.

371
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:46,590
But over time, over many years, you start to see this increase,

372
00:50:46,590 --> 00:50:56,280
thickening of that ventricular wall and the growth of the heart muscle occurs concentric,

373
00:50:57,060 --> 00:51:01,890
such that it reduces the volume of blood within the left ventricle.

374
00:51:04,170 --> 00:51:16,230
So you're going to have less blood being pushed out. And after each beating, the increased muscle thickness in the ventricle is problematic as well.

375
00:51:17,730 --> 00:51:29,940
So this is what causes this and increased plasma volume and increased left ventricle and diastolic volume and pressure.

376
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:37,500
So it's the greater pressure that leads to this concentric formation of muscle within the left ventricle.

377
00:51:39,910 --> 00:51:45,309
Resistance, and this can lead to more arrhythmia,

378
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:54,370
sudden cardiac death and heart failure as a consequence of having this concentric accumulation of heart muscle.

379
00:51:55,150 --> 00:52:09,850
In response to this, the greater alert. So this increases the death and it is a particular problem in that it can increase all kinds of other issues,

380
00:52:09,850 --> 00:52:14,710
such as atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter.

381
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:28,120
There is a an increase in a lot of stroke as a consequence of things that occur downstream of this left ventricular hypertrophy.

382
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:39,060
So so endurance athletes have decrease in this if the musculature within the left ventricle.

383
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:47,450
However, it's not a muscle instead of forming eccentrically or eccentrically.

384
00:52:47,450 --> 00:52:52,250
In other words, the chamber itself in the left ventricle doesn't get smaller.

385
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:57,650
With with endurance training, it may stay the same or might even get a little bit bigger.

386
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:05,810
So that's the difference between endurance training, left ventricle hypertrophy and this kind of logical loss.

387
00:53:13,910 --> 00:53:17,180
So stroke is another type of vascular disease.

388
00:53:18,530 --> 00:53:24,710
It's caused by the interruption of blood supply to the brain and can be caused by different things.

389
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:33,650
Obviously, there's a risk factor as well. And hypertension associated with obesity and other things is certainly a risk factor.

390
00:53:34,190 --> 00:53:40,580
If you have elevated cholesterol and elevated blood levels, lipids, this is a risk factor.

391
00:53:42,050 --> 00:53:48,050
If you have a metabolic disease, hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, these are all risk factors.

392
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:58,620
So you can have a situation in which you have a greater tendency to form blood clots.

393
00:53:59,610 --> 00:54:05,070
Chronic inflammation is one condition in which you have a greater tendency for the blood to clot.

394
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:18,150
This can form blockages within the heart. This can impair the process in which the analysis of the process in which the blood clot is broken down.

395
00:54:20,370 --> 00:54:26,160
Stroke or the increased risk of thrombosis can be due to end of filial disruption.

396
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:31,140
Rupture. Platelet Activation.

397
00:54:32,820 --> 00:54:38,790
So these are a number of events that increase risk of thrombosis, thrombosis and stroke.

398
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:48,450
So two types of stroke. So we have hemorrhagic in a schematic of a tragic stroke.

399
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:52,350
It is caused by a bleed within the brain.

400
00:54:52,530 --> 00:54:55,559
So the arterial wall weakens over time.

401
00:54:55,560 --> 00:55:02,820
And you can have a genetic risk for this or you can have hypertension and this can increase your risk for this.

402
00:55:05,190 --> 00:55:17,160
The schematic throw is, as this occurs, as a consequence of that atherosclerotic process occurring in arterial steps perfused the brain.

403
00:55:17,550 --> 00:55:30,060
So that's what's shown here in this figure. You have a buildup of plaque within the artery, within the brain, and you have an infarction,

404
00:55:30,510 --> 00:55:37,230
a starvation of blood supply to this region of the brain that causes this stroke.

405
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:48,420
So in terms of other types of stroke that you may have thrombotic stroke.

406
00:55:50,190 --> 00:55:54,750
So I mentioned earlier that with atrial fibrillation,

407
00:55:54,900 --> 00:56:02,430
you have a greater risk of stroke because of the apparent pattern of beating

408
00:56:02,430 --> 00:56:07,290
in the atria can cause blood clots forming and that can get into the brain.

409
00:56:07,830 --> 00:56:16,739
So that would be a thrombotic stroke, so that the thrombus itself can form a blockage within the brain,

410
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:25,860
causing ischemia and a stroke that occurred and ballistic stroke in this case, it's a fatty plaque that breaks off.

411
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:37,740
And this this can this epileptic stroke that the embolism here floats into the brain, blocks the vasculature,

412
00:56:38,130 --> 00:56:43,380
that the artery that confuses a certain region of the brain in this can cause of stroke as well.

413
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:51,510
So you can have a fatty streak and embolism can break off and that can can cause this.

414
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:54,930
But more commonly, this is caused by a bone break.

415
00:56:55,860 --> 00:57:03,180
So somebody who breaks a long bone, you can have an emblematic stroke that can occur as a consequence of this.

416
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:11,120
And then cerebral hemorrhage. This is this is what we've talked about before.

417
00:57:11,130 --> 00:57:22,320
This is an aneurysm. This is the leak of blood into a region of the brain that causes pressure on those tissues and causing a brain bleed.

418
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:28,920
And this can damage the tissues as well. Okay.

419
00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:32,370
So now let's talk a little bit about heart failure.

420
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:37,710
Heart failure is a condition that you usually see later on in life.

421
00:57:38,970 --> 00:57:42,690
So as you get older, you have a greater risk of heart failure.

422
00:57:43,530 --> 00:57:53,670
It's a life threatening condition in which the blood can the heart can no longer refuse the systemic vasculature adequately.

423
00:57:54,390 --> 00:58:01,380
And then you have an inability to deliver oxygenated blood to the rest of the body.

424
00:58:02,970 --> 00:58:09,480
And if you have coronary artery disease, this can this can turn into a heart failure.

425
00:58:11,130 --> 00:58:22,890
If you have hypertension, that increased peripheral vascular resistance over time can cause the heart to fail the left side of the heart.

426
00:58:23,370 --> 00:58:33,210
If you have other types of hypertension, like pulmonary hypertension, this can cost the right side of the heart to fail.

427
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,090
So it's a chronic long term condition.

428
00:58:39,090 --> 00:58:47,700
It can develop suddenly, but most of the time it occurs in people who are after the age of 60, 65,

429
00:58:49,170 --> 00:58:58,140
and it may affect the left side of the heart where you have systemic peripheral vascular resistance in terms of hypertension.

430
00:58:58,740 --> 00:59:07,320
It can be in the right side at heart where you have someone who has pulmonary hypertension to the right heart,

431
00:59:07,650 --> 00:59:16,640
right side of the heart can kill or both sides can be in this process of inadequately perfusion tissue for blood.

432
00:59:19,830 --> 00:59:25,110
So obesity is the leading cause of heart failure.

433
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:34,829
There is the study, the Framingham Heart Surgery, a study I'm sorry, the Framingham Heart Study, where they had 6000 adults.

434
00:59:34,830 --> 00:59:38,760
And that baseline age was about 55 years of age.

435
00:59:39,420 --> 00:59:45,300
So they followed these individuals prospectively for 14 years.

436
00:59:46,110 --> 00:59:48,810
And you looked at the incidence of heart failure.

437
00:59:49,930 --> 00:59:59,410
And people who had a BMI of older if they had a two time a doubling of their risk of heart failure and a set of BMI 30 and over.

438
01:00:00,670 --> 01:00:12,850
And then after adjusting for hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes, ventricular hypertrophy for every one kilogram per meter cube,

439
01:00:12,850 --> 01:00:22,240
increasing BMI is associated with a 5 to 7% increase in heart failure for men and women, respectively.

440
01:00:24,390 --> 01:00:35,660
So here is the graph from this study for looking at EMI categories in different colors here for obesity, overweight and normal weight blue.

441
01:00:35,970 --> 01:00:41,280
And we're looking at the cumulative incidence of heart failure at baseline.

442
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:50,609
And then following up, we see that both women and men that the higher BMI is associated with a greater incident,

443
01:00:50,610 --> 01:00:54,450
heart failure percent and this in this particular study.

444
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:17,010
So. In terms of what's going on here so that the heart is responding to different things that can lead to cardiomyopathy.

445
01:01:17,030 --> 01:01:23,660
So you have in this case, you're starting here with excessive adipose tissue accumulation.

446
01:01:24,410 --> 01:01:26,570
This increases blood volume.

447
01:01:27,410 --> 01:01:38,180
And then in some individuals with obesity, you see obstructive sleep apnea and other conditions associated with obesity hyperventilation syndrome.

448
01:01:39,830 --> 01:01:44,060
You have hypoxia and acidosis.

449
01:01:44,420 --> 01:01:48,620
This can contribute to the development of pulmonary arterial hypertension.

450
01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:55,639
In the case going down this part of the pathway, increased circulatory blood volume increase,

451
01:01:55,640 --> 01:02:01,580
left ventricular stroke volume, increased heart attack output, the heart becomes enlarged.

452
01:02:02,030 --> 01:02:06,170
You have greater left ventricular walls, stress, more hypertrophy,

453
01:02:06,530 --> 01:02:14,840
and then you have some inadequacies in terms of left ventricular diastolic systolic dysfunction,

454
01:02:16,610 --> 01:02:19,820
left ventricular diastolic dysfunction leading to heart failure.

455
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:27,110
And so this is a sequence of events that occur downstream of an excess adipose tissue accumulation.

456
01:02:30,530 --> 01:02:41,540
Whenever there's this obesity paradox or some people say it's more of a BMI paradox and in this particular relationship shown here.

457
01:02:42,750 --> 01:02:45,840
And described in this particular paper.

458
01:02:46,590 --> 01:03:00,300
We're looking at the relative risk of COVID mortality here in regard to cardiovascular mortality from heart failure in relation to PMI.

459
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:14,040
And we see here that total mortality, cardiovascular mortality, rehospitalization, you see that as you get into these higher BMI categories,

460
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:21,990
it seems to go down actually, after everything I've told you, this has been referred to as the obesity paradox.

461
01:03:22,710 --> 01:03:31,320
So this is obviously in older subjects or patients with several chronic diseases where this having a higher BMI,

462
01:03:31,950 --> 01:03:34,530
according to this graph, may be protective.

463
01:03:35,340 --> 01:03:45,510
So we're looking at, you know, people that have had a diagnosis of heart failure and we're following them after this initial event.

464
01:03:47,670 --> 01:03:54,300
So these data come from six different studies, about 22,000 people, 23,000 people.

465
01:03:54,660 --> 01:04:01,530
And we're looking at the impact of BMI on mortality and cardiovascular mortality and rehospitalization.

466
01:04:01,530 --> 01:04:09,900
So it seems to there may be a protective effect. Some said, well, this is maybe not an obesity paradox, but a BMI paradox.

467
01:04:11,510 --> 01:04:21,320
What do I mean by that? Well, there have been a number of individuals who have looked at this and describe potential confounders with this.

468
01:04:22,220 --> 01:04:27,470
From looking at here, people after they've been diagnosed with these conditions.

469
01:04:28,010 --> 01:04:35,960
So we're we're looking after people have had this this disease or have been diagnosed with with heart failure.

470
01:04:37,820 --> 01:04:42,190
So. What might be happening here.

471
01:04:42,190 --> 01:04:49,330
These are possible confounders that have been described that might explain this relationship age.

472
01:04:49,750 --> 01:04:57,670
So people who develop heart failure, who have obesity, may develop heart failure in younger age.

473
01:05:00,300 --> 01:05:05,910
Your baby, unintentional weight loss associated with heart failure that occurs,

474
01:05:06,180 --> 01:05:12,510
that reduces the risk and increases their mortality, reduce the risk of survival and increase their mortality.

475
01:05:14,590 --> 01:05:20,010
The individuals who have a higher BMI may also have a greater muscle mass and may have,

476
01:05:20,100 --> 01:05:31,530
and with a higher adipose tissue mass may have greater reserves, metabolic reserves, there may be less CapEx yet in people who have this higher BMI.

477
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:44,500
Earlier presentation of these lower nature peptide levels, restrictive lung disease, venous insufficiency and other co-morbidities.

478
01:05:45,700 --> 01:05:49,930
So this is a potential confounder.

479
01:05:51,110 --> 01:05:52,690
Of higher blood pressure.

480
01:05:52,700 --> 01:06:08,180
So individuals who have obesity may have been treated more aggressively with antihypertensive medications, different cause of heart failure,

481
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:17,420
increased muscle mass and strength with a higher BMI and differences in perhaps cardiorespiratory fitness.

482
01:06:17,780 --> 01:06:37,520
So this is a this is an area of continued investigation and lots of confusing arguments in terms of why this obesity paradox occurs in heart failure.

483
01:06:38,990 --> 01:06:49,729
So this is questioned, at least in the next questions of why are we using BMI to describe risk of mortality in individuals?

484
01:06:49,730 --> 01:06:55,490
Again, heart failure happens in older people. We're finding out people who are at least 60 years of age.

485
01:06:57,050 --> 01:07:11,209
Why are we using BMI as a measure of this? So if you look at in the literature, there's the description of or the discussion of not using BMI at all.

486
01:07:11,210 --> 01:07:19,880
After somebody reaches the age of 65 and looking at waist circumference in other assessments for adiposity rather than BMI.

487
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:28,250
And perhaps what we're seeing here is a BMI paradox rather than an obesity paradox.

488
01:07:28,910 --> 01:07:41,120
So these are some of the explanation as to why this obesity paradox in heart failure have been described in discussed in the literature.

489
01:07:45,020 --> 01:07:51,860
We've already talked about this. Metabolically healthy obesity and cardiovascular disease are carding heart, heart disease.

490
01:07:52,430 --> 01:07:59,900
So you could have somebody who has an elevated BMI and they could have normal blood glucose, lipids and blood pressure.

491
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:09,650
And so from some of the graphs that I showed you earlier, you have people with a BMI of 30 to 30% of that group.

492
01:08:09,660 --> 01:08:16,070
Around 20, 25 to 30% could have normal blood glucose, but lipids and normal blood pressure.

493
01:08:18,530 --> 01:08:23,190
But if you follow these people over time, so there's there's initially not an increased risk.

494
01:08:23,210 --> 01:08:25,160
It's unclear whether there's an increase initially.

495
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:32,060
But after you follow these people over a long period of time, you start to see an increase in cardiovascular mortality.

496
01:08:33,140 --> 01:08:37,640
So the paper that I'm referring to here was published in 2013.

497
01:08:38,660 --> 01:08:41,670
It included eight different studies.

498
01:08:41,690 --> 01:08:51,530
We're looking at about 62,000 adults, and there were 4000 adverse cardiac events over more than a period of ten year follow up.

499
01:08:52,550 --> 01:08:56,960
And you're following people who have metabolically healthy obesity,

500
01:08:57,710 --> 01:09:04,220
and we're finding that they have an increased risk for events compared to metabolically healthy,

501
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:11,060
normal weight individuals when only studies with ten or more years of follow up were considered.

502
01:09:12,690 --> 01:09:21,840
So all metabolically unhealthy groups had a similar elevated risk, whether they were normal weight, overweight or had obesity.

503
01:09:23,490 --> 01:09:33,360
So the Whitehall study that I mentioned earlier is another indication that this having metabolically healthy

504
01:09:33,360 --> 01:09:41,310
obesity is an unstable condition and over time we see a greater incidence of cardiovascular disease.

505
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:47,600
All right. So how do you treat this condition? How do you treat coronary artery disease?

506
01:09:47,660 --> 01:09:55,280
First of all, so first of all, you want to relieve the symptoms and this can be done in a number of ways.

507
01:09:55,670 --> 01:10:03,350
So if somebody has significant coronary artery disease, they may be experiencing angina,

508
01:10:03,350 --> 01:10:08,330
pectoralis, which is a chest pain that arises from the ischemia in the heart.

509
01:10:09,020 --> 01:10:17,060
And you can address this by surgically widening the clogged artery, which is shown here in this diagram.

510
01:10:17,810 --> 01:10:27,650
So you introduce a stent and the stent widens the diameter of the artery and it's left in.

511
01:10:28,010 --> 01:10:35,540
So it's this stainless steel mesh that's put into the artery and it mechanically widens.

512
01:10:36,850 --> 01:10:44,450
And so that's a way to relieve this at this cirrhotic narrowing of the area in the heart.

513
01:10:47,020 --> 01:10:52,870
You can take medication, nitroglycerin, tabs that somebody would find underneath their tongue.

514
01:10:53,300 --> 01:11:02,110
And what this does is it causes phase of dilation. And that phase of dilation can relieve the ischemia temporarily.

515
01:11:02,650 --> 01:11:08,320
So if somebody is experiencing chest pain or has been experiencing chest pain,

516
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:17,110
they may be prescribed nitroglycerin tablets to relieve some of that pain so they can take this medication and it's fast acting.

517
01:11:19,480 --> 01:11:26,770
They would ultimately want to reduce the risk factors slow, stop or reverse the buildup of plaque.

518
01:11:27,850 --> 01:11:33,430
And this can be done very effectively through the use of standard drugs.

519
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:41,320
These are HMG, REDUCTASE inhibitors, and they essentially lower LDL cholesterol.

520
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:44,770
It's a very effective treatment. There are side effects.

521
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:57,280
But what we've seen in the past 20 years or so is that the death rate from cardiovascular disease has declined largely due to this type of medication.

522
01:11:58,030 --> 01:12:03,760
A figure for you here at the end, weight loss and diet modification.

523
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:15,670
So you would want to improve lipid profile, which would increase insulin sensitivity and with lower your hemoglobin payments over time.

524
01:12:16,270 --> 01:12:24,610
This has been associated with a reduction in inflammation so there's less blood to form a blood clot.

525
01:12:26,050 --> 01:12:32,290
The other thing that can be done that is often done is people may be prescribed blood thinners to

526
01:12:32,290 --> 01:12:40,300
reduce the risk of a blood clot formation and to strengthen the heart itself through exercise.

527
01:12:41,290 --> 01:12:47,979
People who have had heart disease, maybe given their insurance company,

528
01:12:47,980 --> 01:12:55,750
might be able to pay for cardiac cardiac rehab in which they go through a program where they increase their physical activity,

529
01:12:55,750 --> 01:12:59,590
which increases their overall fitness and the fitness of the heart.

530
01:13:00,220 --> 01:13:10,810
And this has been shown to prevent cardiovascular disease and a subsequent heart attack after they've had an and it helps overall

531
01:13:10,810 --> 01:13:19,690
strengthening of the individual and improves their rate of recovery and it reduces the risk of having a second heart attack.

532
01:13:21,010 --> 01:13:33,790
Okay. So in regard to the use of statin drugs, this is a holder figure from a paper published a while ago and it's looking at the cumulative event,

533
01:13:33,790 --> 01:13:42,580
free survival in terms of heart disease in individuals who were not treated with death.

534
01:13:43,540 --> 01:13:50,950
So what you're looking at here, years of follow up on the x axis and the blue line,

535
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:56,710
those who had been treated with a stent in the dash red line, people who had not been treated this step.

536
01:13:57,550 --> 01:14:05,080
And you see that there is a much better occurrence or lack of an occurrence of

537
01:14:05,770 --> 01:14:11,160
cardiovascular disease events that occur in people that are taking step twice.

538
01:14:12,310 --> 01:14:26,770
So this is this is this is probably why we're seeing a dramatic reduction in cardiovascular deaths in people who have aspirin disease risk factors.

539
01:14:27,070 --> 01:14:32,380
And so statin drugs are very useful in this regard.

540
01:14:33,550 --> 01:14:40,510
There are side effects that affect people that people shy away from taking this medication.

541
01:14:40,510 --> 01:14:48,790
But there are tons of evidence that would suggest that this is a very effective way to prevent cardiovascular disease in people with elevated blood,

542
01:14:48,790 --> 01:14:55,840
cholesterol and lipid profiles. Does bariatric surgery improve cardiovascular outcomes?

543
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:59,290
Well, there have been a number of studies that have looked at this.

544
01:14:59,590 --> 01:15:08,499
Whenever you talk about people who have had bariatric surgery, people have a very high BMI,

545
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:20,229
at least a BMI of 35 with other risk factors or a BMI of 40 people have either a sleeve gastrectomy or roon y gastric bypass,

546
01:15:20,230 --> 01:15:30,070
and they follow them over several years. And you're looking at here cardiovascular mortality in these individuals.

547
01:15:30,430 --> 01:15:39,430
This is one year post-op, three year post-op, and five years from start to see a separation of these groups where we have in the control group,

548
01:15:39,580 --> 01:15:45,400
those who have had have a similar risk factor profile, similar BMI.

549
01:15:45,510 --> 01:15:56,900
Having greater cardiovascular mortality versus those who have had the bariatric surgery or getting less cardiovascular mortality after that,

550
01:15:56,910 --> 01:16:07,899
the surgery is a five year follow up. So if you talk about cardiovascular disease and medical nutrition therapy, yet you've talked about this.

551
01:16:07,900 --> 01:16:20,580
So a lot of this is for you. For many of you. Okay. So that's all I'm going to present to you today is number and we'll drop on Friday afternoon.

552
01:16:21,720 --> 01:16:30,800
And I will also post some readings for sleep apnea and osteoarthritis.

553
01:16:30,900 --> 01:16:39,510
Very. Okay.

554
01:16:43,520 --> 01:17:04,389
So, you know, there's a lot of little sleep, so it's going to be a lot easier to use it than.

555
01:17:04,390 --> 01:17:11,980
Yes. I know, right?

556
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:17,239
Like something like this, you know? And I was like, Ethan.

557
01:17:17,240 --> 01:17:20,720
So me. What you love?

558
01:17:20,840 --> 01:17:27,190
Oh, yeah. This is the Marilyn Monroe.

559
01:17:27,730 --> 01:17:39,600
They'd be like, Oh, my God.

560
01:17:39,620 --> 01:17:43,040
I don't know. I don't know.

561
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:52,850
It's like, I mean, I started selling clothes.

562
01:17:52,850 --> 01:17:58,430
It's when you, like, just get over it.

563
01:17:58,460 --> 01:18:01,730
No question.

564
01:18:02,890 --> 01:18:07,400
She also, like, it's like the same thing.

565
01:18:07,900 --> 01:18:18,920
So when she's feeling her, I decided to go to a meeting also.

566
01:18:20,390 --> 01:18:27,830
I think it's about that. I haven't heard about that. You know, they gave you a chance.

567
01:18:28,850 --> 01:18:31,470
So you can get you can have, you know,

568
01:18:31,580 --> 01:18:48,730
that was absolutely normal and still have forgotten one person that also increase Chris Christie of times try to meet people

569
01:18:48,740 --> 01:19:08,480
and it won't be even to the elders which is old enough and chunky not to go to one small one to make some discomfort for me.

570
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:22,920
I used to think I knew it was for you.

571
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:33,100
I just knew it was not going to it.

572
01:19:35,490 --> 01:19:40,800
How long are you going to wait? He was supposed to with for many months.

573
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:45,570
It was quite a switch so easily. You have to wait.

574
01:19:46,290 --> 01:19:49,770
Isn't life or darkness. Or if some are not here.

575
01:19:50,310 --> 01:19:57,680
Okay. So not only is it difficult to succeed.
