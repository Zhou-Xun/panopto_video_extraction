1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:10,139
Hey. Good morning, everybody. So I realize they have not I think I haven't kind of.

2
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:15,450
Emily slides from the IMF lecture. I'll ask her again.

3
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,090
Kind of nudge for those or else I. What I'll do is I'll post last year's slides.

4
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:25,020
They're pretty similar. Just so you guys at least have access to that information.

5
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:28,770
That content will not be covered on in the exam.

6
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,260
That was just more for your information and exposure to that content.

7
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:46,620
So I think we'll we'll finish up our lecture where we left off Tuesday and then we'll get into the MMT portion today,

8
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,950
which will hopefully finish next week, Tuesday.

9
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:53,490
So I don't expect us to get through all of our our slides today.

10
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,360
Does anybody have questions on anything before we get started?

11
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:10,800
Okay. So think we left off saying we would talk about the diet, which we will begin today.

12
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:17,390
But just some other risk factors to consider. So psychosocial factors are important.

13
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:27,150
These can be difficult to measure, like measuring somebodys degree of stress that can be hard in terms of capturing that data.

14
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:33,150
But psychosocial factors can contribute to the early development of atherosclerosis,

15
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:39,450
as well as the acute to the acute precipitation of an MRI and sudden cardiac death.

16
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:50,130
So those have been linked. So the link between psychological stress and atherosclerosis can have direct or and or an indirect pathway.

17
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:56,909
So when we think of like a direct pathway, stress can cause damage to the endothelium.

18
00:01:56,910 --> 00:02:05,850
And remember, that's where that that initial damage to the intima is what can trigger the series of events that lead to atherosclerosis.

19
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,850
There's also indirect, so that could be aggregation of traditional risk factors associated with stress.

20
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:19,680
So if somebody is more likely to smoke or smoke more frequently when they are during periods of stress,

21
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:26,370
that can also cause hypertension both through smoking and also just potentially independently through stress alone.

22
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:39,360
And there can be an effect on lipid metabolism. So things like depression, anger, stress, other factors have correlated with cardiovascular outcomes.

23
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:52,329
All right. So numerous inflammatory markers have been reported to be associated with increased risk of CVD.

24
00:02:52,330 --> 00:03:01,840
And the clinical use of these, I would say, is potentially increasing as we learn more about the utility of these.

25
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,770
So we do remember the reactive protein or CRP levels.

26
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:14,560
That's the most extensively studied marker of inflammation and definitely the marker most widely used in clinical practice.

27
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:25,180
So the precise role of CRP assessment using a CRP and the assessment of cardiovascular risk does continue to evolve.

28
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:36,130
But a person's baseline level of inflammation as assessed by a plasma CRP can predict long term risk of a first MRI and ischemia,

29
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:44,259
stroke or peripheral artery disease. So the precise role does remain uncertain.

30
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:47,499
But there is that that, again, it's kind of evolving.

31
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:55,180
So you may see that used more routinely potentially as a determining risk for some of these things.

32
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:02,590
Epidemiological studies have also shown that proinflammatory markers like interleukin six or eight,

33
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:07,580
IL six has a direct causal role in the development of HD.

34
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:13,710
So that's really. Big two here like a puzzle roll.

35
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:23,940
So what is causing that increase in those inflammatory pro-inflammatory cytokines that then can lead to have a direct role in CHP is,

36
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:27,060
I think, definitely under investigation.

37
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:36,040
All right. Let's talk about these risk calculators.

38
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:45,400
So there are these algorithms or essentially these calculators that do consider a variety of factors that can then

39
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:53,980
predict risk of somebody is it could either be a hard outcome like an MRI or just incidents of cardiovascular disease.

40
00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:03,910
And we'll look at just a few different ones. But the Framingham study, again, we talked about that on Tuesday.

41
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:14,350
So that was really kind of our first cohort study, really first designed observational design, set the stage for future epidemiological studies.

42
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:21,879
So the Framingham data demonstrated the lifetime risk for individuals at 840 or at age 40.

43
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:27,459
So this is for coronary heart disease or atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

44
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:38,680
Sometimes those are used interchangeably. So the lifetime risk for coronary heart disease for people at age 40 was 49% in males and 32% in females.

45
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:48,730
Persons free from disease at age 70 had a lifetime risk of 35% and 24% in males and females, respectively.

46
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:57,970
So if you get to age 70 without evidence of cardiovascular disease, you still have a risk of developing it,

47
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:02,920
but it is considerably lower than if you had disease, of course, earlier.

48
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,220
So the lifetime risk of CHC varies.

49
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:15,770
Importantly, with the aggregate of risk factor burden, which is what these calculators attempt to consider in terms of someone's risk.

50
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:25,760
So precise estimation of absolute risk for a first atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease event is desirable.

51
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:33,050
So we want to be able to find those folks that are most at risk to have some type of coronary event,

52
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:39,050
whether that's an abnormal stroke, whatever it may be, so that we can prevent having.

53
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:49,920
Okay. So here are just a couple examples of these risk scores.

54
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,030
You could see these started with the Framingham risk score.

55
00:06:54,930 --> 00:07:00,690
Now there are a ton I think I looked at over 20 of these and I'm just going to present a few here.

56
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:11,650
So there are a number of multivariate multivariate risk models that have been developed for estimating the risk of an initial coronary event.

57
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:15,810
So again, some type of event, we'll look at these endpoints that are assessed.

58
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,079
So this is for use in apparently healthy,

59
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:27,330
asymptomatic individuals based upon assessment of multiple multi factors and many more than are presented here.

60
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:36,100
While all the risk models have advantages and disadvantages, no single risk model will be appropriate for all patients.

61
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:46,090
So there isn't like one kind of go to model or although there are some that are tend to be used more often in a clinical setting.

62
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:52,690
The choice of a specific risk model for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

63
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:58,059
Risk assessment should be individualized based on patient specific characteristics.

64
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:03,639
So age, sex, ethnic self-identification,

65
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:09,640
those are all things that might be considered in terms of what what the cardiologist would choose in terms of a risk model.

66
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:22,360
Most experts feel that the use of risk models that predict hard outcomes or actual events such as death, myocardial infarction, stroke.

67
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,389
So those are considered hard outcomes.

68
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:30,400
Like the patient died from a cardiovascular event. They had an MRI, they had a stroke.

69
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:38,139
So risk models that predict those events are preferred over others that include other endpoints.

70
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:51,620
So maybe it's a non heart outcome would be considered potentially something like angina which is like chest pain or clot occasions.

71
00:08:51,620 --> 00:09:00,100
So like risk of blood clots in the peripheral in the peripheral lens.

72
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:10,660
So things that predict these more heart outcomes are preferred because sometimes these can be more subjective and less,

73
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:14,800
I guess, less objective in terms of an outcome that's assessed.

74
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:25,290
So the prediction of atherosclerotic cardiovascular cardiovascular disease is based on a set of risk variables.

75
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:33,390
This is usually assessed in the outpatient setting. Okay. So this might be with a patient with their primary care physician are more likely.

76
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:41,760
Well, yeah, potentially with their primary care physician. If they're disease free, if they have risk factors, it might be with a cardiologist.

77
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:52,410
Most estimated ers use the variables of age, gender, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, systolic blood pressure,

78
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:58,440
diabetes, which is kind of a newer addition to some of the newer risk scores in current smoking.

79
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:02,670
So let's look at the Framingham risk score from 1998.

80
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:12,910
This was the original kind of cardiovascular risk score, and this was derived again from a largely Caucasian population in this town in Massachusetts.

81
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:17,340
So that's that population that was partaking in that study.

82
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:23,850
Subsequent studies have suggested that the Framingham risk score does perform well

83
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:29,000
for prediction of coronary heart disease events in black and white men and women.

84
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:37,770
So although the population from which this was derived was largely homogenous, it has done well in prediction in different ethnicities.

85
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:46,050
So the Framingham Risk Score was modified in 2022 by the third adult treatment panel.

86
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:47,880
The 83, which we'll discuss,

87
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:57,210
may get to that today or definitely next week for their use and for use in their recommendations for screening and treatment for dyslipidemia.

88
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,760
So the modifications included elimination of diabetes from the algorithm.

89
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,700
So some had that added early and some had that added later.

90
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:14,610
So there's you'll see that there is discordant use of diabetes as a variable.

91
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:24,760
Broadening of the age range and inclusion of hypertension treatment and age specific points for smoking and total cholesterol.

92
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:31,180
So you can see here how these were adjusted in terms of what variables are included in that calculator,

93
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:36,490
what has been excluded, and then the endpoints assessed.

94
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:41,560
So what do you guys think about excluding family history?

95
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:53,130
Why might they do that? I don't really know.

96
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:56,650
I think it's probably because people sometimes don't know.

97
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:04,230
And what is defined as a family history can be variable, but that's definitely a risk factor, right?

98
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:10,450
If you have a family history of CVD, but you can see those are not included in these risk assessments.

99
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:18,560
So I can play that like like if somebody hands on the generations, right?

100
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:26,250
Like, so for example, I know all my relatives smoked so that was not lifestyle.

101
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:35,710
Sure that contributed to that person's like my mother and I smoked so yeah.

102
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:39,730
You know so I think so that's why. Yeah, that's a good point.

103
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:43,840
Like if there's a removal of a person's risk factor, ah,

104
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:52,540
is there still like a considerable family history if you remove potentially one of the risk factors that led to that family history?

105
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:56,489
That's a really good point. Okay.

106
00:12:56,490 --> 00:13:03,630
So again, the Framingham risk score was revised in 2008.

107
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:11,520
And I think what they added here were some important vascular outcomes included in this risk score,

108
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:16,379
which has shown to have some reliable predictive ability.

109
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:23,130
But again, those those harder outcomes would have been more desirable for in terms of use.

110
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:33,870
So the one we'll use in class is going to be this American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association risk calculator.

111
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:38,160
So there's one from 2013. They've also updated it in 2008.

112
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:45,809
But you can see here what they included in that those variables.

113
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:52,020
So age, gender, total cholesterol, HDL, cholesterol, systolic blood pressure,

114
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:57,690
if they're on blood pressure, treatment, diabetes, yes or no, current smoking, yes or no?

115
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:09,990
Okay. So several cohorts of patients were used to develop these, the 2013 HCC Age and Cardiovascular Risk Calculator.

116
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:16,420
The first risk model to include data from large populations of both white and African-American patients.

117
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:26,190
So a little bit more representative in terms of the populations that were studied to actually develop the risk calculator.

118
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:34,880
The potential limitation of this one is that family history of premature cardiovascular disease is not included in the model.

119
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:40,440
This may under estimate risk in patients with very strong family histories of cardiovascular events.

120
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:52,470
Remember that risk of having, let's say, a sibling or a parent that had an event very young, like a heart attack in the age 40.

121
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:57,540
That is a significant risk factor so that this calculator does not capture that.

122
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:01,050
So they are saying that it may underestimate risk for those folks.

123
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:10,700
Okay. So now I don't want to spend a ton of time on these calculators, but you will use it if you choose to do the hypertension case study.

124
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:18,530
I'll have you pull up the tool and plug in the data and then we'll also use it next week for a case study we'll do in class.

125
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:24,450
So I've been having questions on this. I know this is very medical.

126
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:30,500
In terms of like nutritionally, we wouldn't be using these necessarily.

127
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:36,110
This would be between the patient and the physician. How often these are used in the clinical setting, I'm not really sure,

128
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:43,220
but I know that they are used to evaluate this and potentially maybe start somebody on medication.

129
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:49,370
Okay. So that's the one we will use.

130
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:57,440
All right. Let's pop over to our inventory slides for today.

131
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:09,280
Okay. So the objectives for our discussion on M.A. for cardiovascular disease is

132
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:14,920
to recognize the role of dietary fatty acids on cardiovascular disease risk.

133
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:20,560
Understand the role of diet and our nutrients in the management of blood lipid levels.

134
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:25,800
And consider and describe the role of various dietary patterns on heart health and CVD risk.

135
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:33,549
So we're going to kind of go from fatty acids to foods and nutrients to dietary patterns,

136
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:40,060
and then we will kind of consider as a class what we think is most important to consider.

137
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:48,099
Do we want to look at nutrient specific data, food specific data, or like an entire dietary pattern?

138
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:52,960
What makes the most sense in terms of how we practice as dietitians?

139
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:59,380
Okay. So we'll start with the role of dietary fatty acids on CVD.

140
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:08,630
So who's this? Does anybody know? This is our friend from earlier in the semester.

141
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:17,419
This is. It's okay. So, remember, we learned a lot about starvation from ants of his disabling or what other type

142
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:25,490
of information he was really instrumental in developing for that heart disease.

143
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:32,750
Yes, that's right. So he was a big he had this ecological study which will talk about the seven countries study.

144
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:44,690
He gets blamed for probably unfairly, in my opinion, for a lot of the current dialog, which was kind of getting away from in terms of low fat diets.

145
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:47,810
And we'll talk about how that stemmed from some of his work.

146
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:56,620
So yes, this is answer kids. He was an epidemiologist. He looked at rates of heart disease in different populations.

147
00:17:56,630 --> 00:18:00,950
So the seven countries study is the study.

148
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:08,000
The answer is what's involved in among others, of course. But that was the first major study to investigate diet and lifestyle,

149
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:17,000
along with other risk factors of cardiovascular disease across contrasting countries and cultures and over an extended period of time.

150
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:27,620
It was an ecological study. Who can just tell me, what does that mean if we're looking at a study that's ecological in nature?

151
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:32,210
Yeah. So great collecting data.

152
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:40,700
Yeah. It's as a good data. So we can't we don't have data on individuals.

153
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:48,170
So when we think of that, we're collecting data on like a group level.

154
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:53,930
Hemingways heard of the ecological fallacy. What does that mean?

155
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,290
What's the population?

156
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:11,100
Well, if you like, at the individual level, it's just like an overarching observation idea, specifically what's going on on a different level.

157
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:22,590
Yes, it's the ecological fallacy is essentially we're going to make individual level conclusions based on group level data.

158
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:30,450
So a famous example of this is that intake and breast cancer risk.

159
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:36,810
So there were ecological data on countries and it was like per capita consumption.

160
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:42,340
And then so they looked at per capita fat consumption and how how would you collect that data?

161
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:48,689
It might be like data on like purchasing of like how much of this food was

162
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:56,880
purchased on like a countrywide level or like even imports of foods high in fat.

163
00:19:56,890 --> 00:20:06,930
So that's like the kind of data that would be collected. So you're looking at per capita fat consumption and breast cancer risk in a population.

164
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:17,390
So this show, like countries with higher per fat cat per capita consumption, have higher rates of breast cancer.

165
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:25,200
So how that got translated was what? High fat intake can cause breast cancer.

166
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:31,350
That has not been shown to really be the case, that it's not a real risk factor.

167
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:41,770
There may be some studies that show that that was largely kind of removed once we had a really good, well-designed observational data.

168
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:46,230
So that can happen if we look at these these ecological studies.

169
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:53,340
So what Ansel Pease found was populations whose diet was rich in plants tended to have

170
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:58,140
lower rates of heart disease in populations with higher intakes of meat and dairy.

171
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:03,150
So we kind of already touched on this, but how did this get translated?

172
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:17,620
That is that is right. So we should have we should recommend low fat diets to prevent heart disease.

173
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:22,359
And that's not what we said. This was just that association.

174
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:31,599
And of course, some of the countries in the seven countries studies have very high fat populations and low levels of cardiovascular disease.

175
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:36,129
So but this is how that data got translated.

176
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:40,630
So he is largely blamed for like our big low fat diet craze.

177
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:46,880
All right.

178
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:54,870
So historically, a chief concern, health concern about dietary fat has been their role in promoting or protecting against coronary heart disease.

179
00:21:55,170 --> 00:22:01,620
Other concerns relate to the possible role in the genesis of diabetes, stroke, obesity and cancers.

180
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:12,119
So there's lots of research that's looked at the relationship between fat intake and health outcomes and it is becoming more clear,

181
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:16,529
although I think it's still really confusing with regard to certain types of fats.

182
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:26,340
But the overall body of research indicates that the type of fat is far more important than the proportion of calories from total fat.

183
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:32,709
And consistent with the 2015 dietary guidelines,

184
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:40,270
the advisory committee of the committee that recommends what is actually published in the Dietary Guidelines.

185
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:50,830
Now, what they recommend isn't always what ends up in the actual report recommended no upper limit on the percentage of calories of total fat.

186
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:55,240
And then the 2020 dietary guidelines did not review this evidence.

187
00:22:55,240 --> 00:23:01,180
So that was kind of a big shift. Right. We're not going to cap total fat per se as a percentage of calories.

188
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,540
Did everybody know that that that recommendation existed?

189
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:12,730
Or do you still think of fat in terms of what percentage of our calories should come from fat?

190
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:21,790
I think a lot of people still I mean, I know a lot of dietitians do still really working with those macronutrient distribution.

191
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:28,360
So we'll talk about that as a class, what we think, where we think we should move with with that and how to talk to our patients about it.

192
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:35,589
Okay. So populations with higher total fat intake do not always have more heart disease.

193
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:45,490
Does anybody know of an example? Kind of a classic example.

194
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:50,910
Yes, you. Think of.

195
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:58,100
Well, okay. Think of it more in terms of like a population or like a culture, something cultural.

196
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:05,970
Yes. Like something like the Inuit or Eskimo populations have very high fat intake and they do not have heart,

197
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:11,210
high heart disease relative to the U.S. population.

198
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:17,360
Yeah. And there's other countries as well. And we'll talk a little bit more about like Mediterranean diet and all of that.

199
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:25,680
Okay. So in the past we said reduced total fat intake.

200
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:33,940
Should be below 35% of calories. Now it's more.

201
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:42,270
Multiple cohort studies, randomized clinical trials have shown that lowering total fat intake has no meaningful effect on heart disease,

202
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:45,870
stroke, cancer, diabetes, or even long term weight control.

203
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:53,129
Why do you think that is? Why are these studies showing this?

204
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:57,840
And we do have pretty good, clear, consistent data to demonstrate that.

205
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,900
So if you lower your total fat intake,

206
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:11,250
we don't necessarily see that there's a meaningful impact on your heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes, even with.

207
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:17,670
Yeah. You introduce a discovery that the loss of dietary cholesterol.

208
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:26,010
A direct link to a set of.

209
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:33,670
Yes. Right. Well, we will talk about like dietary cholesterol.

210
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:38,990
Yes. Is that important in terms of raising blood cholesterol?

211
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:44,430
Well, yeah, because I think that that becomes a lot of it.

212
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:49,130
So now we know that these are important.

213
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:54,710
Are they? Well, it's not. A lot of clients have heard that about my husband, so to speak.

214
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:58,710
Right. That's exactly.

215
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:05,250
Yeah. If we put all that together, that's not going to give us a clear understanding.

216
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:14,300
So we know that different fatty acids have divergent a divergent relationship with blood lipid levels, different outcomes.

217
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,120
So and just divergent effects on health.

218
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:27,980
And because a reduction in dietary fat is almost a company is almost always accompanied by an increase in what happens in carbohydrates,

219
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:29,200
in particular,

220
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:38,600
refined starches and sugars and emphasis on total fat intake has thus tended to obscure our appreciation for disease protecting dietary patterns,

221
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:42,890
which are based fundamentally, fundamentally on types of foods rather than macronutrient targets.

222
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:53,090
So when people especially like in the nineties, early 2000, there was like a lot of low fat foods,

223
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:58,820
but these were tended to be things that were high in refined carbohydrate.

224
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:03,290
What happens when we replace fat with refined carbohydrates?

225
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:09,479
Does our risk of heart disease go down? No.

226
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:14,490
And in fact, there are some studies that show it actually goes up and makes that replacement.

227
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:23,380
Okay. So issues with recommending a low fat diet. We kind of talked about that.

228
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:28,450
The role of dietary fat and the ideology of obesity remains controversial.

229
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:37,430
So for a long time, the dietary guidelines were hesitant to remove that limit on percentage of calories from fat.

230
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:45,429
They didn't want to take that away because they worried that some people would increase their fat consumption that is calorically dense,

231
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:49,450
that's going to lead to weight gain or more obesity.

232
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:54,729
That's very simplified. And who really reads the dietary guidelines?

233
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:59,500
I'm not sure. But that tends then tends to dictate a lot of national guidelines or vice versa.

234
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:05,050
So some scientists and organizations continue to recommend low fat diets.

235
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:11,080
Others recommend only calorie counting without regard to specific macronutrient targets.

236
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:14,950
And still others recommend high fat, low carbohydrate diets.

237
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:25,240
So the role in the ideology of obesity is still kind of controversial compared with making recommendations about specific foods.

238
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:31,510
It is difficult to communicate to patients how to achieve a target level of total fat intake.

239
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:40,030
It's a little bit easier now because a lot of patients do use like apps to track their intake and kind of track their macronutrients.

240
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:47,970
But it can be difficult to communicate how to consume like 30% of your calories from fat.

241
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:53,380
That doesn't always translate to people. Okay.

242
00:28:53,460 --> 00:29:01,950
In the message to reduce dietary fat has been translated by food manufacturers and consumers into a potentially harmful set of food choices,

243
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:06,570
particularly these ultra processed foods which are rich in starch and sugar,

244
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:11,610
which appear to have contributed to obesity and type two diabetes epidemics.

245
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:17,009
So this may have done more harm than good, but the fat is bad.

246
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:23,070
Let's cut fat. Now we're going to make all these products that are very low fat but have very low nutrients,

247
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:30,030
highly refined in their carbohydrate and sugar content that is proven to be more dangerous.

248
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:37,750
All right. Let's talk about trans fatty acids.

249
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:46,700
Low levels of trans fatty acids do occur naturally in some foods, especially dairy and needs from ruminant animals.

250
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,340
So cattle, sheep and goats.

251
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:59,290
However, much higher levels of trans fatty acid consumption did occur as a result of industrial partial hydrogenation of unsaturated fatty acids.

252
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:08,710
So adding hydrogen to unsaturated unsaturated fatty acids to make them solid at room temperature and essentially more stable.

253
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:14,470
So that was kind of the the idea between behind these trans fatty acids.

254
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:23,280
Why are trans fatty acids so bad? So industrial trans fatty acids do confer harmful cardiovascular effects?

255
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:30,160
This is another area in epidemiology where there would be good argument for a causal relationship with cardiovascular disease.

256
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:34,230
So consumption of trans fatty acids causes heart disease.

257
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:41,850
Why are they so harmful? Yeah, they're not naturally occurring, so everybody can't digest them.

258
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:46,559
Not naturally occurring. So usually in highly processed foods.

259
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:50,190
How is our body managing them? Well, yes.

260
00:30:55,320 --> 00:31:00,390
Okay. So how. Yes. How do we actually process these foods, these nutrients?

261
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:08,580
What else in terms of measurable things, like in terms of blood lipid levels, what are they shall do?

262
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:16,320
Yeah. Increase. Yes. So they're bad because they raise LDL in lower HDL.

263
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:22,890
That's why they're so problematic. And we see that has very harmful effects.

264
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:35,090
Okay. So the FDA ruled that partially hydrogenated vegetable oils are no longer generally generally regarded as safe.

265
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:40,489
So that's a huge that's a huge thing. That's a huge public health decision.

266
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:43,490
That was years in the making to get to that point.

267
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:48,620
Do you guys know what year these were actually banned from the food supply?

268
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:52,760
Yeah, 2018. So not that long ago.

269
00:31:54,320 --> 00:32:00,170
So there really are there should not be industrial trans fatty acids in our food supply.

270
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:04,120
Are there still trans fats globally? Yes.

271
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:14,270
Yes, there are. So it's now that we've kind of tackled that problem with some public health measures, the FDA stepping in, U.S. as well.

272
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:18,540
Other countries still have industrial trans fatty acids.

273
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:26,640
Yes. So not only those who have less trans fat, you don't have to disclose it.

274
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:35,240
So it is still like art and sex scenes, like you said in there and it's still seen on the market.

275
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:44,130
So the artificially made trans fatty acids are banned.

276
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:48,470
Now we'd have to look at the specific language of what is a total ban.

277
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:54,200
There are some foods that they actually have trans fatty acids that that, you know, we can't.

278
00:32:55,280 --> 00:33:00,960
Yeah. So like, if you look at crystal, which is like shortening.

279
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:08,420
If you look on the label now, it'll say fully hydrogenated palm oil instead of partially hydrogenated.

280
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:15,590
So it's it's just the way they're so processed, they're still not like plastic, but they don't have trans fats.

281
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:20,450
Yes. Jesus Christ.

282
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:27,900
So is quite stable. Well, it's probably an oil one.

283
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:36,600
Yeah. The palm oil and coconut oil that you should be able to hear what they have to say.

284
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:42,330
Like, as as scientists. Like, I used to work this.

285
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:47,730
It's like the dog. It's hard to control the temperature in a factory.

286
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:53,760
So you need that additional leeway so that you aren't, like, losing every time you get.

287
00:33:54,030 --> 00:34:01,020
Sure. And, you know, also, like, application wise, you like.

288
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:07,559
You sometimes need that buffer because people want a certain texture or a certain flavor.

289
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:14,460
And if they don't get it. Yeah. So you have to like put, you know, you can't have like not clean.

290
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:19,560
So it's something. It's like a texture and flavor profile.

291
00:34:20,970 --> 00:34:24,720
Mm hmm. Yeah.

292
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:25,350
Yeah.

293
00:34:25,890 --> 00:34:37,230
You need more solid fats that you can keep at a certain temperature consistency that's going to lead to the product that people were questioning.

294
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:43,350
Like, I wish I would know.

295
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:50,130
It's a balance between what we expect as consumers and what tastes good and is acceptable.

296
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:53,910
Like a person. It kind of that's the whole point of it, right?

297
00:34:53,910 --> 00:34:56,950
To have this, like, flaky, buttery pastry.

298
00:34:56,970 --> 00:35:00,500
And so if you remove that, if you change it too much, you're going to lose that.

299
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:07,360
A big customer experience. And I get upset about that.

300
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:21,269
Sure. I'm not saying that, you know, in palm oil is I won't get off on a tangent, but there's a lot of, not rightfully so,

301
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:28,620
noise about palm oil and how it is not sustainable because of the the removal of habitat to produce it.

302
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:36,540
But I read an interesting article like if we were to shift to something else because palm oil is so prevalent that the effects

303
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:43,670
of like changing to something else could be kind of equivalent in terms of how detrimental that would be to the environment.

304
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,740
So I think, yes, it's bad.

305
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:49,630
The alternative may not be better.

306
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:58,680
When we think about how much we have to achieve from other sources and to the detriment that would be so it's really

307
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:04,980
complicated in terms of when we think about the the environmental impact over our food supply and our food choices.

308
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:14,819
Okay. Talked about that 2018. So we'll look at this table with all of our other types of fat.

309
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:22,290
But trans fatty acids, again, part of partially hydrogenated vegetable oils, the cheap food sources in the US adults.

310
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:29,220
And yet we're sick in full fat margarine, commercial baked goods and deep fried foods.

311
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:35,519
So leading contributors in the diets of us adults who are fast food margarines again,

312
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:42,720
these commercial baked goods, sweet rolls, cookies and the effects on cholesterol that increase LDL, lower HDL.

313
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:49,260
And then you can see here in very clear language, this is like a conglomeration of data.

314
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:52,050
It increases risk of coronary heart disease.

315
00:36:52,560 --> 00:37:00,420
So much so that we actually had the FDA ban these partially or industrial trans fatty acids from the food supply.

316
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:06,020
So very dangerous. All right.

317
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:15,560
Let's talk about saturated fatty acid. So I think this is the most confusing and controversial currently, in my opinion.

318
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:23,060
So while recommendations on saturated fat have conventionally grouped all saturated fatty acids together,

319
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:26,840
increasing evidence indicates that different saturated fat,

320
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:34,850
fatty acids and different food sources of saturated fat have divergent effects on cardiovascular and metabolic health.

321
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:49,069
Consumption of saturated fats as compared with carbohydrate raises LDL concentrations also lowers triglyceride rich lipoproteins.

322
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:53,750
And then you can see to a lesser degree will also raise HDL.

323
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:59,160
So this is kind of what this is showing. These are some different saturated fatty acids.

324
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:06,350
So we do see, yes, they raise LDL, which is the lipoprotein most intimately involved with atherosclerosis,

325
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:12,560
but they also to a lesser degree, and that's important in my opinion, raise HDL.

326
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:25,910
So you hear the argument for saturated fats, not being bad is generally due to this that has been looked at in terms of the effects on LDL and HDL.

327
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:33,500
So often this can equate to no net change in total to HDL cholesterol ratios.

328
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:41,120
So these effects of saturated fats on the lipid profile are less adverse than those of trans fats.

329
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:45,800
I don't think that's controversial at all. Right. These are not as harmful as trans fats.

330
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:57,250
But are they as benign or now it's like they're not as harmful to once thought I take that is true but

331
00:38:57,250 --> 00:39:03,310
I think we'll put that into some some context to see what we really think about about saturated fats.

332
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:13,690
Okay. So this figure demonstrates changes in total in the ratio of total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol for

333
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:20,080
consumption of different chain length saturated fatty acids as an ISO caloric replacement for carbohydrate.

334
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:25,300
And this is based on a meta analysis of randomized controlled feeding trials.

335
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:32,880
So some do consider the ratio of total to HDL cholesterol to be more of a discriminant predictor of risk.

336
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:43,080
Although LDL is still probably regarded as the most discriminative feature of risk if we're thinking about blood levels so

337
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:50,880
consistent with the neutral effect of the most common dietary saturated fatty acids which are palmitic in the stearic acid.

338
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:55,650
These ratios. Based on systematic reviews and meta analyzes,

339
00:39:55,950 --> 00:40:02,620
have found no association between the overall intake of total saturated fat intake and coronary heart disease.

340
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:12,990
So we're going to talk about this further. So there's been a lot of analysis that have come out to say that that there is no

341
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:17,280
association between overall intake of saturated fat and coronary heart disease.

342
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:26,070
What do you guys think about that as a just a conclusion in general based on your knowledge and nutrition expertise?

343
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:32,830
I think the context matters, and it's really hard to say that, obviously,

344
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:42,460
but I think the context in which it seems like we're not when we consume saturated fats like we might be saturated fats,

345
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:47,010
like protein bars, you know, whatever, it's on your plate.

346
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:54,160
So if they can do something along those lines, that I would say is more realistic.

347
00:40:56,110 --> 00:41:07,900
Yes, I agree that the context matters. The foods that saturated fatty acids tend to be and also may have health benefits or be high health risk foods.

348
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:14,520
I do think it is a problem to look at data this way with individual separate occasions.

349
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:20,920
It's definitely important. Like this is why we have nutritional science is they looked at the nutrient level.

350
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:25,480
We do not eat single nutrients, correct? So we can't.

351
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:31,689
This is what bothers me about a lot of the dialog about these studies when they're looking

352
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:37,480
at individual saturated fatty acids because we do not consume nutrients in a single form.

353
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:46,410
So we'll talk about this. And when you say something, no association between something and risk of coronary heart disease.

354
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:52,860
So the last thing I'll say is that our risk for coronary heart disease is high in this country.

355
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:56,190
Right. So we have very high risk.

356
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,390
So to say that consuming something will not increase your risk.

357
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:04,290
Your risk is already very high. That doesn't make me feel like.

358
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:09,030
Right. Maybe we should think about, well, what's actually going to lower our risk.

359
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:14,040
And that's what we'll we'll explore a little bit. Okay.

360
00:42:14,050 --> 00:42:24,410
So in some and again, we'll look at a meta analysis that caused quite a stir, but in some the divergent associations of different individuals,

361
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:30,479
saturated fatty acids with blood lipids and clinical endpoints and the divergent

362
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:35,790
association of different major food sources and clinical endpoints have called into

363
00:42:35,790 --> 00:42:40,709
question the wisdom of maintaining a dietary recommendation that limits total saturated

364
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:45,840
fat intake from all sources as as compared with food specific recommendations,

365
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:54,840
which I think we would all support if we can just go and specifically focus on the more harmful foods, I think that would be appropriate.

366
00:42:55,890 --> 00:43:04,170
Nonetheless, this does remain controversial. The 2018 draft of the World Health Organization report on fatty acids maintains

367
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:08,880
a recommendation to keep saturated fat consumption below 10% of total calories.

368
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:15,950
The 2020 Dietary Guidelines report while maintaining this general recommendation.

369
00:43:15,950 --> 00:43:20,390
So they still kind of hung on to that less than 10% of calories from saturated fat.

370
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:29,450
They did add that the health effects, dietary saturated fat or any other nutrient depends not only on the total amount consumed,

371
00:43:29,990 --> 00:43:38,750
but also the specific type of saturated fatty acids inherent within the food matrix sources and degree of processing in the overall dietary pattern.

372
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:49,460
So that's important language. But how we translate that to actual work with individuals can get a little bit of.

373
00:43:54,200 --> 00:44:00,349
Okay. So just some quick food base guidance. So this is from the 2020 Dietary Guidelines report.

374
00:44:00,350 --> 00:44:03,620
Again, substituting some animal sourced foods,

375
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:10,639
especially processed meats and certain dairy products with sources of polyunsaturated fats such as seafood, seeds, nuts,

376
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:16,040
legumes and appropriate vegetable oils would be an appropriate recommendation,

377
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:24,080
rather than just focusing on avoiding all saturated fat or just maintaining that specific calorie level of saturated fat.

378
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:31,560
Okay. So let's move on to model and saturated fatty acids.

379
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:40,560
Data has shown that replacing carbohydrate with model unsaturated fatty acids may decrease LDL cholesterol and triglycerides

380
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:50,430
and have no real impact on HDL model in such a saturated fatty acid can also decrease the oxidation of LDL cholesterol,

381
00:44:50,430 --> 00:44:58,290
which is that kind of key step in atherosclerosis. Once that and LDL both undergoes that modification and becomes oxidized,

382
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:05,190
that's when it becomes problematic and is consumed by those macrophages and then turns into foam cells.

383
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:13,740
So model unsaturated fatty acids may help prevent or at least protect against the oxidation of LDL.

384
00:45:15,870 --> 00:45:20,129
Mediterranean populations that consume high amounts of monounsaturated fats.

385
00:45:20,130 --> 00:45:28,560
Yes, fats. Monounsaturated fatty acids from extra virgin olive oil and nuts appear to be protective against heart disease.

386
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:36,180
And there are some really good studies that looked at that. A really big one that actually got retracted for some reasons, all discussed.

387
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:40,319
But that has been shown really important.

388
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:46,230
So that that study looked at monounsaturated fatty acids from extra virgin olive oil and nuts.

389
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:53,460
Does anybody know what the leading source of monounsaturated fatty acids is in the US diet?

390
00:45:59,110 --> 00:46:07,839
It's actually red meat. So our population doesn't eat high amounts of milk from these plant sources.

391
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:11,110
There are mammals, natural gas and dairy and animal products.

392
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:20,380
So we will see different studies that really show no benefit in terms of heart protection from unsaturated fatty acids.

393
00:46:21,130 --> 00:46:27,400
So you have to consider what food sources they were looking at when they do those studies.

394
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:32,710
And that's going can be a big problem with that analysis where you don't get that level of information.

395
00:46:36,490 --> 00:46:39,610
All right. Let's move on to polyunsaturated fatty acids.

396
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:47,320
We have omega six polyunsaturated fatty acids, which includes linoleic acid, arachidonic acid.

397
00:46:47,470 --> 00:46:50,740
And then we have omega three polyunsaturated fatty acids.

398
00:46:51,900 --> 00:47:01,950
So which of these are essential fatty acids? I guess this little alpha.

399
00:47:01,950 --> 00:47:05,610
Little is an alpha in a letter. These are essential fatty acids.

400
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,780
Okay. So that is they cannot be synthesized by humans.

401
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:16,410
We have to get them from the diet. So if we don't have them in our diet, we can develop the central fatty acid deficiency.

402
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:25,950
So intake of both omega three and omega six polyunsaturated fatty acids have been associated with a decreased risk of coronary heart disease.

403
00:47:29,670 --> 00:47:38,159
Okay. So based on randomized controlled feeding trials, which is when we think about diet studies,

404
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:41,610
that's kind of like a little bit of a gold standard, I would say.

405
00:47:41,610 --> 00:47:47,670
Yes, there's limitations, but you have randomized group that's going to eat this, which you control and this group eats this.

406
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:52,620
So it can be very hard to control diet to people.

407
00:47:52,650 --> 00:47:56,640
Right. So that's why we don't see these feeding trials a lot.

408
00:47:57,300 --> 00:48:01,110
But when we do, we probably do give them this amount of weight.

409
00:48:02,550 --> 00:48:07,320
But it is well-established that omega six fatty acids from plant oil.

410
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:16,320
So this is things like soybean oil, safflower oil, sunflower oil, corn oils do improve lipid in lipoprotein profiles.

411
00:48:18,390 --> 00:48:23,520
So what effect do omega six fatty acids have on cholesterol levels?

412
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:38,829
They're going to lower LDL cholesterol apolipoprotein B which remember is the the apolipoprotein

413
00:48:38,830 --> 00:48:49,120
most often LDL and also can lower triglycerides while also increasing HDL cholesterol.

414
00:48:49,690 --> 00:48:55,720
So this leads to a significant overall reduction in the total to HDL cholesterol ratio.

415
00:48:58,180 --> 00:49:05,440
So what have you heard about potentially? What have you heard about omega six fatty acids that maybe it's not so favorable?

416
00:49:06,190 --> 00:49:10,600
Yeah, cause if you have it there pro-inflammatory is a pretty for that.

417
00:49:11,650 --> 00:49:13,390
That's like a big talking point.

418
00:49:15,670 --> 00:49:23,650
So despite the rise pro-inflammatory effects of omega six fatty acids, these effects have not been shown in human trials.

419
00:49:23,950 --> 00:49:31,329
So that's important to point out. You will hear that a lot in mouse models or I hear a lot of dieticians say

420
00:49:31,330 --> 00:49:35,740
this not to increase omega six fatty acids because they're pro-inflammatory.

421
00:49:36,370 --> 00:49:44,199
That really has not been shown to translate translate from animal to human models and again, single nutrients.

422
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:53,470
We do not consume single nutrients, types of foods that maybe also how polyunsaturated fatty acids could combat inflammation.

423
00:49:53,500 --> 00:50:00,070
So we don't know. Like if we look at the effects of a single nutrient on a single cell in a mouse model,

424
00:50:00,490 --> 00:50:06,040
that does not dictate what's going to happen when we adjust, ingest just a variety of nutrients.

425
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:16,870
So I would say be very careful with with some of that dialog around these imagery effects on omega six fatty acids.

426
00:50:18,550 --> 00:50:21,760
Studies will evaluate the ratio of omega six to omega three.

427
00:50:21,790 --> 00:50:25,630
We've heard about this like we have a really poor ratio in this country.

428
00:50:26,470 --> 00:50:28,780
We eat a lot more omega six than omega threes.

429
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:38,290
So studies evaluating these ratios in the diet or blood or sometimes showed higher ratios are linked to worse health outcomes.

430
00:50:38,830 --> 00:50:39,250
However,

431
00:50:39,250 --> 00:50:47,650
such associations in humans are driven by differences in the levels of omega three fatty acids rather than differences in the levels of omega six.

432
00:50:47,830 --> 00:50:57,190
So kind of the general guidance is don't change your omega six fatty acids, just try and increase your omega three fatty acid consumption.

433
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:05,299
That does not always get translated that way. Okay.

434
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:13,080
So meta analyzes of both estimated dietary consumption or objectively measured blood biomarkers of total MGO SIC

435
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:19,730
Omega six fatty acids and linoleic acid in particular have been associated with lower risk of coronary heart disease.

436
00:51:21,170 --> 00:51:23,329
Notably, benefits for coronary heart disease.

437
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:31,760
In observational cohort, studies are seen whether lentil linoleic acid is consumed in place of total saturated fat or total carbohydrate.

438
00:51:31,770 --> 00:51:41,150
So that's important. Studies have shown when you replace omega six fatty acids for either saturated fat or if you replace them for carbohydrate,

439
00:51:41,450 --> 00:51:48,260
you see a benefit in lower risk of cardiovascular disease. And not all the other fatty acids showed that.

440
00:51:50,730 --> 00:51:58,860
So based on the lipid and other physiologic benefits, meta analysis of observational cohort studies and older clinical trials,

441
00:51:59,370 --> 00:52:05,610
the US dietary guidelines and many other guidelines do recommend diets that are rich in omega six fatty acids.

442
00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:15,910
Okay. So let's move on to omega three fatty acids. These have been associated with a decreased risk of coronary heart disease.

443
00:52:17,170 --> 00:52:27,249
So omega three family of polyunsaturated fatty acids includes EPA and DHEA, which are found in fish oil, especially cold water, oily fish.

444
00:52:27,250 --> 00:52:31,420
So salmon, anchovies, mackerel, herring, sardines, tuna.

445
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:40,120
A third member of the family is the alcohol in a lab which is found in the oil of plants such as walnuts, soybeans and canola oil.

446
00:52:41,530 --> 00:52:45,580
Consumption of consumption of omega three fatty acids can reduce triglycerides,

447
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:51,790
but some studies have shown it may also affect so it can raise or lower cholesterol levels.

448
00:52:51,790 --> 00:52:58,090
So in general, they do lower LDL, lower triglycerides with some maintenance of HDL.

449
00:53:02,090 --> 00:53:12,770
Omega three fatty acids may increase total LDL cholesterol, total and LDL cholesterol, particularly among those that have elevated triglycerides.

450
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:16,660
So the dose, the source of omega three fatty acids.

451
00:53:16,690 --> 00:53:22,110
We'll talk about foods versus supplements. The composition of the omega three fatty acids.

452
00:53:22,110 --> 00:53:27,860
So if it's EPA alone or EPA plus DHEA can markedly modify lipid responses.

453
00:53:28,610 --> 00:53:32,570
And so, again, health effects of like fish oil supplements. We'll talk about a little bit later.

454
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:39,950
Yeah. Can you repeat that part again? You said something about in high triglycerides and then eating fish.

455
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:51,020
Yes. So omega three fatty acids can increase total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol, especially among folks that have high triglycerides.

456
00:53:51,350 --> 00:53:55,850
But if not, they can lower it. Can it it can have divergent effects.

457
00:53:55,850 --> 00:54:02,330
So I think this data is not as clear as I think we once thought it was.

458
00:54:02,670 --> 00:54:08,059
You think like, yes, it'll lower your triglycerides, lower LDL, it'll raise HDL.

459
00:54:08,060 --> 00:54:14,030
We actually don't see that effect on HDL as clearly now that we have a lot better studies.

460
00:54:15,410 --> 00:54:21,170
So in people with high or low triglycerides, there can be divergent effects of these things.

461
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:25,760
And it really matters. The source. How much all of that.

462
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:34,720
So we'll look at this table. This was from a few years ago, and we'll we'll also look at the updated table.

463
00:54:36,550 --> 00:54:39,790
So this is looking at the different classes of fatty acids.

464
00:54:39,790 --> 00:54:43,410
So we have polyunsaturated fatty acids.

465
00:54:43,430 --> 00:54:50,210
These are mega systemic acids here that lower LDL lowers HDL and triglycerides.

466
00:54:50,250 --> 00:54:54,640
So all of these in the section coronary heart disease is uncertain.

467
00:54:54,970 --> 00:55:02,440
So I think this was this was the slide or this was the table up until like 2019.

468
00:55:03,430 --> 00:55:13,570
And if we look at the updated table, especially from polyunsaturated fats, omega six, we see it lowers LDL triglycerides and increases HDL.

469
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:19,240
So the data has really kind of a fall and polyunsaturated fatty acids.

470
00:55:20,740 --> 00:55:25,050
And now this language went from uncertainty to neighborhoods, risk of coronary heart disease.

471
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:28,300
So you have pretty strong evidence for that.

472
00:55:28,930 --> 00:55:34,419
So let's look at each of these. We talked about trans fatty acids, saturated fatty acids.

473
00:55:34,420 --> 00:55:41,830
So cheap food sources are dairy foods, red meat, some plant oils, specifically coconut and palm oil.

474
00:55:42,610 --> 00:55:49,330
Leading food contributors in the US diet of adults is dairy foods, especially cheese, milk, ice cream and red meat.

475
00:55:51,130 --> 00:55:53,890
It increases total cholesterol, right?

476
00:55:53,890 --> 00:56:01,990
Because we see an impact on LDL and to a lesser degree, it also raises HDL, may increase risk of coronary heart disease.

477
00:56:01,990 --> 00:56:05,410
So this conclusion and this is from up to date, this is kind of like the.

478
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:16,480
Scientific evidence, the body of experts, they have come together to make their overall conclusions based on the data.

479
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:20,810
So stay still may increase risk of coronary heart disease.

480
00:56:20,830 --> 00:56:26,950
We'll see if that language evolves over time. Monounsaturated fatty acids.

481
00:56:26,950 --> 00:56:31,180
Okay. Vegetable sources. The chief food sources are canola oil and olive oil.

482
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:38,500
What are the lead? The leading sources of these and in the US diet beef, margarine, chicken and olive oil.

483
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:46,240
So it lowers LDL cholesterol and triglycerides and has been found to have no real effect on HDL.

484
00:56:46,630 --> 00:56:50,260
So probably has no association with the fats, important parts.

485
00:56:51,940 --> 00:57:01,810
So even though we have all this data on Mediterranean diets and why they're so good, it's when it's actually looked at in studies.

486
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:07,570
I think the reason there's no association is probably because a lot of the populations,

487
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:14,200
main sources of model and saturated fatty acids are potentially from these animal based

488
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:19,300
sources where we maybe don't see as big of a benefit would be my kind of thought on that.

489
00:57:21,460 --> 00:57:23,980
Okay. We talked about polyunsaturated fatty acids.

490
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:33,549
You can see the key food sources and then the leading contributors in other diets lowers LDL, lowers triglycerides, increases.

491
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:36,610
HDL may reduce risk of heart disease.

492
00:57:37,150 --> 00:57:46,270
Here's how omega three polyunsaturated fatty acids lowers LDL and lowers triglycerides and potentially no effect on HDL.

493
00:57:46,270 --> 00:57:56,660
And it still may reduce risk of coronary heart disease. Anybody have questions on these fatty acids?

494
00:57:57,410 --> 00:58:10,700
Yeah. So there's a. See that again is pretty cool.

495
00:58:10,750 --> 00:58:16,479
So maybe cruciferous vegetables, maybe have some omega three fatty acids.

496
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:20,680
I didn't know that. I'm glad you pointed that out.

497
00:58:20,740 --> 00:58:24,520
It will be interesting to look at. Yeah, we should.

498
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:30,130
I mean, there's tons of health benefits from those foods, but I did not know that omega three fatty acid content was one of them.

499
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:35,700
What I would suggest. Yes, can be just kind of a random question.

500
00:58:35,710 --> 00:58:37,450
I think we talked about this last time,

501
00:58:37,450 --> 00:58:50,769
but with like saturated fat and LDL or some other like effects with like the different types of saturated fatty acid.

502
00:58:50,770 --> 00:58:59,649
So we talked about the different types or like I thought it kind of like affected LPL with like inhibiting maybe the breakdown.

503
00:58:59,650 --> 00:59:12,280
I can't remember exactly what it was, but so are there divergent effects of specific saturated fatty acids on LP, little A or lipoprotein lipids?

504
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:15,580
Yeah, maybe. Possibly.

505
00:59:16,450 --> 00:59:19,180
Okay. I'd be good to look at.

506
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:26,830
I can't say that I know that data offhand, but I would guess that that might be involved in why we see the divergent effects.

507
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:35,750
Yeah. So what I would suggest is print this out or have this as a research.

508
00:59:36,210 --> 00:59:40,480
You know, it's just helpful to have and some of these things may change over time.

509
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:46,960
All right. Let's talk about dietary cholesterol.

510
00:59:47,170 --> 00:59:55,900
So dietary cholesterol raises the total serum cholesterol, but is a less important contributor than saturated fat.

511
00:59:55,910 --> 01:00:02,710
So cholesterol we get from foods can affect our cholesterol levels, but to a much lesser degree than saturated fat.

512
01:00:03,820 --> 01:00:10,990
So for most individuals, only a minor emphasis on reducing dietary cholesterol alone is it's kind of awkward.

513
01:00:13,590 --> 01:00:18,809
Okay. So does anybody know what the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Committee said about cholesterol?

514
01:00:18,810 --> 01:00:22,050
Because the language on it changed in those guidelines.

515
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:35,739
So that was the first cycle that de-emphasized the importance of previous

516
01:00:35,740 --> 01:00:40,120
recommendations to limit consumption of dietary cholesterol to 300 milligrams a day.

517
01:00:40,130 --> 01:00:45,660
That would be the the recommendation we had and cycle after cycle, the dietary guidelines.

518
01:00:45,670 --> 01:00:56,230
So they really didn't have any limit set for dietary cholesterol and they simply said it's no longer a nutrient of concern for Americans.

519
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:05,080
We'll talk. We'll see what we think about that. So what is a source of dietary cholesterol in our diets?

520
01:01:06,010 --> 01:01:09,879
Animal products? Yeah. Animal products. Eggs.

521
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:12,790
Right. So they're cheap source of dietary cholesterol.

522
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:19,870
The association between regular egg consumption and risk of coronary heart disease and stroke is uncertain.

523
01:01:21,220 --> 01:01:24,790
It's still kind of controversial. It's like really back and forth.

524
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:33,490
As an example, in 2013, a meta analysis of eight prospective cohort studies with almost 500,000 participants found

525
01:01:33,490 --> 01:01:38,380
no association between egg consumption and risk for coronary heart disease and stroke.

526
01:01:38,950 --> 01:01:47,229
So for most individuals, only a minor emphasis on reducing dietary cholesterol alone is needed since it is a less important

527
01:01:47,230 --> 01:01:52,660
contributor to serum cholesterol levels and clinical endpoints than saturated fat or trans fat.

528
01:01:54,340 --> 01:01:59,110
However, some patients who either consume very large amounts of dietary cholesterol or in

529
01:01:59,110 --> 01:02:04,780
whom serum LDL cholesterol response to moderate cholesterol intake is unfavorable,

530
01:02:04,780 --> 01:02:08,620
may benefit from a reduction in total cholesterol.

531
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:17,019
So maybe some that are having little effect on their LDL through dietary changes may have to restrict their cholesterol further,

532
01:02:17,020 --> 01:02:20,500
but for most, it's not a huge point of emphasis.

533
01:02:22,090 --> 01:02:27,790
Okay. So I spoke about that big that analysis looking at 500,000 participants,

534
01:02:27,790 --> 01:02:32,500
no association between egg consumption and risk for coronary heart disease and stroke.

535
01:02:34,270 --> 01:02:40,870
This study came out in 2019. It is a relatively large sample size.

536
01:02:41,170 --> 01:02:45,790
Long duration of follow up. So you can see here findings.

537
01:02:45,790 --> 01:02:51,640
If we look at just that, I would say never just read the abstract, but for today we're going to look at that.

538
01:02:51,670 --> 01:02:59,530
So among U.S. adults, higher consumption of dietary cholesterol or eggs were significant, significantly associated with higher risk of incident.

539
01:02:59,530 --> 01:03:04,000
CVD and all cause mortality in a dose response manner.

540
01:03:06,070 --> 01:03:10,330
So another kind of conflicting that analysis here.

541
01:03:12,610 --> 01:03:20,680
See what you guys think about this. So this study looked at a single measure of diet.

542
01:03:23,420 --> 01:03:27,290
As the exposure and then 30 years later looked at outcomes.

543
01:03:28,430 --> 01:03:33,770
What do you think about that? No, that's a huge limitation.

544
01:03:33,770 --> 01:03:36,350
That's like asking us, what did you eat yesterday?

545
01:03:37,430 --> 01:03:43,669
And then 30 years from now, we're going to look at our risk of heart disease and refer back to what we ate at one time.

546
01:03:43,670 --> 01:03:46,790
Point that's problematic. A lot of studies do that.

547
01:03:47,210 --> 01:03:51,620
They have one measure of dietary intake. So I think this is potentially really misleading.

548
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:58,670
So I would say interpret these findings in the context of several previous studies which have shown

549
01:03:58,670 --> 01:04:05,390
that low to moderate intake is not associated with a higher risk of CVD in generally healthy people.

550
01:04:07,780 --> 01:04:13,480
All right. So let's look at kind of the timeline with our recommendations about that.

551
01:04:13,630 --> 01:04:19,600
So in the eighties, moderate use of eggs, what does that mean then?

552
01:04:19,630 --> 01:04:28,410
It's like, no, it's really just the adults that are problematic. 99 These try using two egg whites in place of a whole egg in 2018,

553
01:04:28,810 --> 01:04:34,660
1995 limit in places like you also said that they're twice and use egg yolks and

554
01:04:34,660 --> 01:04:40,840
whole eggs in moderation use egg white connect substitutes really qualified.

555
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:45,549
No specific guidance about eggs 2010 one egg yolk remains.

556
01:04:45,550 --> 01:04:51,100
It's not raise blood cholesterol levels, nor does it increase risk of cardiovascular disease.

557
01:04:51,100 --> 01:04:55,030
And now in 2015, this is where this is most updated No.

558
01:04:55,030 --> 01:05:00,520
Ten recommendations, but does note that men, if you need boys, may be in the community eggs.

559
01:05:00,970 --> 01:05:10,300
So maybe certain populations could cut back and then says, oh, well, vegetarians made of eggs.

560
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:16,780
So I'm still kind of confused, like what we should be doing with eggs.

561
01:05:16,780 --> 01:05:21,940
But for most people it's probably pretty safe to have an egg a day.

562
01:05:22,810 --> 01:05:27,250
We'll see if that I know, right? Like my dad eats them often.

563
01:05:27,870 --> 01:05:35,019
We'll always ask, like, is this okay? Yes. And then was like, I don't know, maybe, maybe do like just one.

564
01:05:35,020 --> 01:05:39,819
Don't do the two every day. So it's very confusing.

565
01:05:39,820 --> 01:05:44,020
I think it's I'm still kind of confused about it. For the most part.

566
01:05:44,020 --> 01:05:44,889
They're probably okay.

567
01:05:44,890 --> 01:05:53,760
So what is the other health benefit of eggs calling in the egg yolks, all the vitamins and minerals in the egg yolks, complete source of amino acids.

568
01:05:53,760 --> 01:06:00,550
So good source of protein. So we have to also think about like net benefit against the the evidence there.

569
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:09,350
For some people, it may be a very good protein source. Yeah, it's okay for eggs.

570
01:06:09,750 --> 01:06:32,200
And as you can see, this video shows that they were able to do it in a week.

571
01:06:32,740 --> 01:06:37,780
Yeah, so. So I think for FDA.

572
01:06:38,050 --> 01:06:41,290
Yeah, I think you'll find what I would say.

573
01:06:41,290 --> 01:06:45,220
Well with most things nutrition will to discuss this further,

574
01:06:46,810 --> 01:06:56,190
especially maybe for if you can find a article or paper to suggest and to support your point of view on that.

575
01:06:56,560 --> 01:07:02,889
Right. So that's the problem with nutrition. You can find ten that show this association and five that show the opposite.

576
01:07:02,890 --> 01:07:10,060
So people really feed off of that in terms of like writing books, blogs, they can find data to support their point of view.

577
01:07:10,450 --> 01:07:16,360
So just be careful. What I would say is the most boring advice is usually the best advice with regard to nutrition.

578
01:07:19,060 --> 01:07:23,620
Okay, so let's kind of sum this up. Fat and heart health.

579
01:07:23,620 --> 01:07:27,070
In the past we said reduced intake of total and saturated fat.

580
01:07:27,370 --> 01:07:33,640
There is a shift toward replacing saturated fat with polyunsaturated fats while eliminating trans fats.

581
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:38,170
Replace refined carbohydrates with fat sources can be helpful.

582
01:07:39,490 --> 01:07:42,670
And there's literature still full of opposing positions.

583
01:07:44,140 --> 01:07:46,930
But I will say that the saturated fat conundrum.

584
01:07:48,710 --> 01:07:54,290
Maybe there is our study that showed an increased risk with saturated fat consumption and heart disease.

585
01:07:54,290 --> 01:08:01,969
But we definitely see definitely see a decreased risk when we replace saturated fats with some of these other fats.

586
01:08:01,970 --> 01:08:08,780
So probably unsaturated fatty acids. So that I think may be where we should focus our energy.

587
01:08:09,740 --> 01:08:12,080
We do see a risk reduction when we do that.

588
01:08:12,620 --> 01:08:21,260
So we can keep our risk very high and not mess with our saturated fats or we can work on risk reduction when there is such a big disease burden,

589
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:28,370
number one, cause of death in the country. I think that's where maybe more energy should be focused in terms of that dialog.

590
01:08:30,750 --> 01:08:36,700
All right. So let's we'll just do a couple of sides on food and coronary heart disease.

591
01:08:36,700 --> 01:08:42,300
So move away from single nutrients. And now let's look at the data on foods and or food groups.

592
01:08:44,850 --> 01:08:46,920
So what have we heard about fruits and vegetables?

593
01:08:47,160 --> 01:08:53,969
Fruits and vegetables are generally high in vitamins, minerals, fiber, water, content, low and total energy.

594
01:08:53,970 --> 01:09:00,660
So these are nutrient rich foods and energy poor.

595
01:09:00,660 --> 01:09:03,180
So you'll hear nutrient dense energy poor.

596
01:09:03,570 --> 01:09:12,030
That's how we would probably describe most fruits and vegetables, and that's the qualities that are postulated to play a role in weight management,

597
01:09:12,030 --> 01:09:16,680
promotion of healthy blood sugar levels and blood pressure regulation.

598
01:09:18,210 --> 01:09:24,690
So there is considerable evidence that fruit and vegetable consumption is associated with reduced risk of coronary heart disease.

599
01:09:24,690 --> 01:09:29,819
So the nurses health study and the health professionals follow up study.

600
01:09:29,820 --> 01:09:35,940
So have we heard of these? These are like where a lot of these recommendations come from.

601
01:09:35,940 --> 01:09:42,000
So the Nurses Health Study, this is a cohort, a longitudinal cohort study out of Harvard,

602
01:09:42,330 --> 01:09:47,040
the health professional follow up study and slightly male equivalent to that.

603
01:09:49,770 --> 01:09:57,210
So these are population based cohort studies evaluating the association of fruit and vegetable consumption with risk for coronary heart disease.

604
01:09:57,690 --> 01:10:06,540
And they found that in persons with the highest quintile of fruit and vegetable intake had a relative risk of coronary heart disease of 0.08.

605
01:10:06,540 --> 01:10:09,810
So what happens if a relative risk is below one?

606
01:10:12,330 --> 01:10:18,750
Yeah. It's protective, right? So that is like a 20% reduction in risk of coronary heart disease.

607
01:10:18,750 --> 01:10:23,310
That is a big reduction. Okay.

608
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:25,800
That's compared to those with the lowest quintile of intake.

609
01:10:26,310 --> 01:10:35,310
It's also observed that for every daily serving increase of fruit or vegetable intake, there is a there was a 4% lower risk of heart disease.

610
01:10:37,020 --> 01:10:44,980
Okay. So data from the inner heart study that was again, that case control study of myocardial infarction in 52 countries.

611
01:10:44,990 --> 01:10:52,799
So identifying people that have had an MRI and then looking back at their exposures revealed that daily consumption

612
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:59,940
of fruits and vegetables was associated with a 30% reduction in odds of MRI compared to lack of daily consumption.

613
01:11:02,150 --> 01:11:07,010
So pretty good data there to support intake of fruits and vegetables.

614
01:11:09,380 --> 01:11:13,520
All right, let's talk briefly about fiber and then I think for we'll stop here.

615
01:11:15,710 --> 01:11:21,380
Okay. So research has shown that high dietary intake of fiber, including the fiber found in fruits and vegetables,

616
01:11:21,380 --> 01:11:26,870
can produce a modest reduction in total and LDL cholesterol levels in adults.

617
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:32,540
This is especially true when foods rich in fiber replace those that are high in saturated fat.

618
01:11:34,730 --> 01:11:38,000
And then there are some studies that looked at biomarkers.

619
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:45,890
So high serum concentration of something called enteral lactose, which is a biomarker of dietary high,

620
01:11:46,550 --> 01:11:54,740
high fiber intake potentially have been inversely correlated with the risk of acute coronary events and mortality.

621
01:11:56,990 --> 01:12:00,680
So there is pretty good evidence that there is an inverse association between

622
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:06,410
dietary fiber specifically or most notably soluble fiber and serum lipid levels.

623
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:15,280
So if you've seen the Cheerios commercials where the dad's eating it to protect his heart, why?

624
01:12:15,340 --> 01:12:18,640
What is the association there with the Cheerios?

625
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:25,280
Probably the soluble fiber content in Oats cereal.

626
01:12:25,730 --> 01:12:33,080
Why they're saying that's protective. So soluble fiber especially helpful in lowering LDL cholesterol.

627
01:12:33,650 --> 01:12:37,760
Soluble fiber can reduce both LDL and overall cholesterol,

628
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:46,160
perhaps by binding with total or binding with cholesterol particles in the digestive system, moving them out of the body before they're absorbed.

629
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:52,430
So we can suggest like these are some things we can actually suggest to people.

630
01:12:52,730 --> 01:12:56,320
So very low risk interventions that are potentially very helpful.

631
01:12:56,330 --> 01:13:00,360
So try to eat 10 to 25 grams of soluble fiber per day.

632
01:13:00,380 --> 01:13:07,550
So really specifying these soluble fiber choices work towards this goal gradually and be sure to drink enough fluids.

633
01:13:08,090 --> 01:13:13,650
So here are some examples of soluble fiber rich foods.

634
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:22,600
So you can see this is where those old products come in, which is why we see the the big heart on materials that.

635
01:13:25,900 --> 01:13:28,910
Okay. Finally, just let me see.

636
01:13:28,930 --> 01:13:32,440
When was the study? 2019. Suzanne in The Lancet.

637
01:13:32,860 --> 01:13:41,970
So in a recent research study, this investigators pooled the results from 243 studies looking at the health effects of dietary fiber.

638
01:13:42,340 --> 01:13:46,060
Think excluded all studies and any studies about fiber supplements.

639
01:13:47,080 --> 01:13:49,270
So this was fiber from food sources.

640
01:13:49,900 --> 01:13:59,200
So they ended up with data from over 4600 people which to make sure that's correct, that doesn't sound like not many studies,

641
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:06,550
but maybe they were small studies found a very strong relationship between high dietary fiber intake and better health outcomes.

642
01:14:07,270 --> 01:14:12,249
So basically intake of at least 25 grams of food fiber per day.

643
01:14:12,250 --> 01:14:21,639
And this doesn't necessarily differentiate just soluble fiber is associated with lower weight, lower blood pressure, lower blood sugar level,

644
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:30,520
lower cholesterol, and a lower risk of developing or dying from diabetes, heart disease, stroke, breast or colon cancer.

645
01:14:31,510 --> 01:14:36,549
So the study's results were consistent and those were consistent.

646
01:14:36,550 --> 01:14:41,930
And the dose response curve was very linear, meaning more fiber, the better the outcome.

647
01:14:41,980 --> 01:14:47,140
So I think we have pretty good data to support the role of fiber,

648
01:14:47,590 --> 01:14:55,659
the ability to kind of grab on to that excess cholesterol and take it to the digestive system and excrete it.

649
01:14:55,660 --> 01:15:02,530
But also the type of foods that tend to contain fiber probably also have a lot of really good health benefits as well.

650
01:15:04,830 --> 01:15:11,670
Same have questions on any of that? Yeah. You're saying soluble fiber is the one that gets the cholesterol, right?

651
01:15:11,700 --> 01:15:18,300
That mechanistically? Yes. That would be the type of fiber that has that will.

652
01:15:22,460 --> 01:15:28,070
Does anybody know how much soluble fiber they eat a day? No, I don't either.

653
01:15:28,370 --> 01:15:33,260
It has been interesting to track the rate of beer recommending 25 grams of soluble fiber day.

654
01:15:33,830 --> 01:15:37,910
It would be interesting to see what that actually looks like in terms of a day of

655
01:15:38,300 --> 01:15:41,900
eating food and like how easy that is if we're going to be recommending that.

656
01:15:43,460 --> 01:15:47,230
Okay. Well, we'll pick up here on Tuesday.

657
01:15:47,390 --> 01:15:54,170
So you guys have a great weekend. Oh, great.
