1
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:17,530
Just four months ago.

2
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:29,860
Hooking up two of the I don't know, no matter what.

3
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:33,390
Yeah, look at it. Yeah, it's on here.

4
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:47,070
Anybody seen any chemical hazards used for?

5
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,710
Yeah, that's pretty much remembered for.

6
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:11,850
Look, I saw something about DuPont losing, like, a legal challenge against the people that I care about that can make a lot of stuff like chemicals.

7
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:32,740
I think I think it was people. Yes.

8
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:50,230
Okay. Hi, everyone. This is our presentation about the investigation of people's exposures here in the state of Michigan.

9
00:01:52,460 --> 00:02:01,460
So this introduced our scenario. Michigan is currently experiencing a heat bath exposure crisis within several communities.

10
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:10,820
So today we will be presenting more about magnitude, sources, pathways, routes and related risks of P force in this specific Michigan community.

11
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:19,490
We're just using community broadly and talking about what could be done in specific Michigan communities in the state.

12
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:28,620
So just to start off with what our key force key force, our widely used chemicals that break down very slowly over time,

13
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:36,179
and they're used on a variety of different products such as food packaging, fire extinguishing,

14
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:43,559
foam, manufacturing facilities, household products, you name it probably has passed on.

15
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:52,250
It was used commercially starting in the 1950s and thousands of chemicals in many different types of products.

16
00:02:52,260 --> 00:03:00,510
So this studies for human health, while we do know a lot about the facts, we don't know the effects of every single fine chemicals.

17
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:07,080
People can be dangerous to health because there's a variety of different health effects.

18
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:16,200
So just broadly speaking, reproductive affects, developmental, increased risk of cancer related, reduced ability and immune system suppression.

19
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:23,160
So like I just said, like some of the key chemicals are do cause one of these more so than the other.

20
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:28,380
But it's hard once you've been exposed to directly source your exposure.

21
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:42,719
Yeah we're still investigating what people what exactly PFAs chemicals cause each human health problem and so many different variables.

22
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:48,480
It can be hard to track what exact chemical, but we have a general idea of the most commonly used chemicals.

23
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:59,490
Just the history of he in Michigan. And there was a tannery called Wolverine Worldwide and they operated for about 100

24
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:05,010
years and they contaminated large areas of water and land with PFOA chemicals.

25
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:13,950
So once they detected this contamination, this triggered the big p fox investigation within the United States, but especially here in Michigan.

26
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:22,200
And so for us, locally, in reliably 2017, they found PFOA contamination just right here in the Huron River.

27
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:28,950
So currently there's 231 people sites under investigation by Eagle.

28
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:41,070
These sites are sites where they have confirmed data that p force was found in these sites here and that the site is contaminated.

29
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:47,370
So this is a just a good map of Michigan and their current sites that are marked as key force sites.

30
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,580
And I think this was updated just this month. Yeah, December 2nd.

31
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,720
So getting into our roots a little bit.

32
00:04:56,020 --> 00:05:02,500
So this little graphic we found stuff that we see pretty commonly for a lot of the exposures we've talked about.

33
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:06,340
So you have some of the more direct effects just using consumer products.

34
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:10,630
We also have industry into the waste, into the environment.

35
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,220
Yeah, just getting into our bodies in a lot of different ways.

36
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:21,760
So I said there's some of the direct exposure that we get with the consumer products.

37
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:30,850
Then there's the air and dust. We talked a little bit how those household products can just like lead to the air a little bit getting into the air.

38
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:38,140
We primarily see, though, the indirect ingestion with the contaminated drinking water bioaccumulation in seafood.

39
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:43,820
We do see some increased risks in people eating more fish, however.

40
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:53,140
So while the indirect direct ingestion is the primary exposure we see, we are getting decreases in novel exposures and novel spills.

41
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:59,139
But due to just the persistence in the environment, we're still getting a lot of that contaminated drinking water,

42
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:03,610
even though our consumer products don't necessarily have PE for us any more.

43
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:10,780
This is just kind of a timeline that shows that we see the phase outs, reductions and alternatives,

44
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:17,710
which is why we're not having as much of the direct exposure and less of the novel exposure in water.

45
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:23,770
But like I said, it is a persistent Campbell. So it is still going to be around even with these phase outs.

46
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:29,920
Yeah. So just kind of summarizing that with the ingestion exposure,

47
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:36,160
we're still getting increases in exposure to the legacy piece for us as it accumulates and persists.

48
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:41,350
Yes, that's going to be the greatest concern in terms of the consumer products.

49
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:46,929
You can see it's just found in tons of things, just how it gets directly in there with people, you know,

50
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:52,930
especially children, putting some things in their mouth, all of that, but also the dusts in the household environment.

51
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:58,600
But again, general decrease in concern with the direct increase in concerned with the indirect.

52
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:08,650
So for exposure assessment, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services and the Michigan PFA Action Response

53
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:14,950
Team already have a very in-depth past readiness plan that utilizes a phased approach.

54
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:18,490
We will be building upon that in this proposal.

55
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:27,489
So before we continue with our proposals or proposed additions, it's going to be important to take note of what it currently entails.

56
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:32,740
And the phases are monitoring, detection, investigation and intervention.

57
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:39,070
Yeah. Super exposure assessment. Right now we're focusing on monitoring.

58
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:46,899
So for this scenario, we're looking at drinking water that's suspected to be contaminated in surface and groundwater,

59
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:57,850
in public waterways and in private wells will be use it utilizing EPA Method five 37.1 and EPA S.W. 846.

60
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:10,150
Method 3727. So Method five 37.1 was published in 2009 and revised in 2018 to include 18 analytes.

61
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:13,780
So since this is four plus levels in drinking water,

62
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:20,439
we would have to go to wells and collect 250 milliliters samples and then we'll send it out to the

63
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:27,669
lab where it will be analyzed using their spectra to figure out which Analyte is in drinking water.

64
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:36,960
And according to Washtenaw County, it would cost about $290 per well or like family that we look at.

65
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:50,370
So it is very costly. So the next phase would involve detection of farms and water systems, and this largely involves two separate actions.

66
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:56,770
So we'd like to determine if there are interconnected water systems with nearby municipalities,

67
00:08:56,780 --> 00:09:01,220
and this can be useful for intervention, which we'll discuss about later on.

68
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,739
And then after that,

69
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:12,020
you want to develop procedures to assure that the water after connection and or flushing will meet Safe Drinking Water Act requirements.

70
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:19,940
The third phase is the investigation or the actual exposure and self assessment,

71
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:26,150
and this involves sending out letters of invitation and consent forms.

72
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:34,880
Next, you have bio sampling, which involves collecting blood serum samples as fast as found to bind serum albumin.

73
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:38,910
And within this, you can take convenient samples.

74
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:44,180
However, that's typically not the best thing to use because they're not representative.

75
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:48,320
So you can't extrapolate your results to the broader community.

76
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:54,740
And most typically we would see the use of one stage cluster sampling,

77
00:09:54,740 --> 00:10:00,560
which is representative, and within that you have to develop eligibility criteria,

78
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:06,409
a sampling frame and then calculate sample sizes for the number of individuals

79
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:10,730
and the number of houses you would need to reach that number of individuals.

80
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:16,280
Lastly, we would hand out questionnaires for adults and children.

81
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:27,980
Within one stage cluster sampling. It's important to note that a cluster is considered a household and all individuals within the household.

82
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:34,339
The first step of this sampling method would be developing eligibility criteria,

83
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:41,360
which are community specific and largely based on the extent of contamination in the area.

84
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:48,950
The next step is developing the sampling frame, which involves all households within the geographic region of interest.

85
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:58,430
And the data for this or the information for this will typically come from local, local water suppliers.

86
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:08,899
Water billing. Local health departments typically have a list of who's on a private well in the area, and if those are harder to obtain,

87
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:16,639
you can gather your data from U.S. Census information for sample size calculations for individuals.

88
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:25,250
You can use these two equations and you can further adjust at least the number of households based on your expected response rate.

89
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:36,020
And it's also important to note that the standard deviation is based on population parameters obtained from NHANES 2011 2012 data.

90
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:45,120
These are example calculations, which if we have time or if there are questions at the end, we can go over these.

91
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,660
It's a very timely slide to explain.

92
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:59,970
Within bio sampling or after you do bio sampling and you get results from the samples, you have to analyze that data.

93
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:05,580
And to do so, you calculate a geometric mean, a confidence interval for that mean.

94
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:13,709
And you can also stratify the data to estimate high and low areas of exposure or even to look at individuals.

95
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:26,910
Specifically, the results from the bio sampling analysis will then be compared to national levels, which again is obtained from NHANES.

96
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:35,579
And then the questionnaires that are handed out provide a little bit of insight into the exposure pathways and roots,

97
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:39,790
and these answers can be related to specific magnitudes of exposure.

98
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:45,650
For a better characterization, to reduce participation bias,

99
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:53,940
we want to be sure to not replace households that do not participate or choose not to participate, as this would increase participation bias.

100
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:55,290
However,

101
00:12:55,290 --> 00:13:05,310
we can replace households that do not meet the eligibility criteria and we can also increase the sample size if we have a low participation rate.

102
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:16,500
The questionnaires for adults and children have three overlapping questions or groups of questions involving demographics,

103
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,930
exposure, assessment and health conditions.

104
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:30,629
The exposure assessment questions more or less go over where your sources of water come from and potentially other exposure routes.

105
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:39,690
But because drinking water or ingestion is going to be the main one that's going to talk about water predominantly for adults,

106
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:48,330
there is one one more group of questions that involves occupational history and again, that can help characterize your exposure better.

107
00:13:49,920 --> 00:14:01,110
The fourth and final phase of the current readiness plan involves intervention, and there are many steps or steps you can take within this phase.

108
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:06,600
However, there are three that are more or less pertinent to exposure assessment itself.

109
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:17,370
These involve local health departments providing point of use filters to residents on private wells and if only non-certified filters are available.

110
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:24,420
You must perform post filter p fast testing using EPA Method five 37.1.

111
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:32,400
Next, you can also flush the water system if there is access to emergency interconnection with nearby municipalities.

112
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:33,090
However,

113
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:42,930
this can only be done if there has been a thorough assessment of the known contaminated water and the water system of the nearby municipality.

114
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:51,600
This also requires post filled, post flushing, testing or analysis utilizing EPA Method five 37.1.

115
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:59,490
And lastly, given the results from bio sampling, the questionnaires and water sampling,

116
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:10,350
you can develop associations which will further allow you to develop a predictive multivariate model of serum fast levels only within the community.

117
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:20,550
It's important to note that that model can't be used to look out a region broader than the community because the eligibility criteria are specific.

118
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:27,900
Yeah. So now we're going to talk about our proposed changes to the Michigan readiness plan.

119
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:33,750
So we didn't propose any changes to the detection or the intervention.

120
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:44,600
So I proposed changes to monitoring involve developing geographic information systems that can predict

121
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:50,870
pulse drift throughout the community so we can go directly to the source and stop it from spreading.

122
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:56,300
This would utilize method as w 846, 830, 27.

123
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:02,300
And then we'd also began taking tissue samples of wildlife and fauna within that area,

124
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:08,450
because it's important to take into consideration the fact that people might be hunting and consuming wildlife.

125
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:12,320
So then just modifying our plan to include that as well.

126
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:16,670
And then we'd involve industry with detection and Model X.

127
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:28,280
So EPA Method S.W. 846 Method 8327 is specifically used to identify people in drinking water.

128
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:32,780
So there's 24 different types of people that can be detected from this method.

129
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:38,809
So for our scenario, we would go out into different bodies of water within the neighborhood like lakes, ponds,

130
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:49,400
rivers or water treatment plants to see directly what is like where the contamination sources and it's a very similar method to 537,

131
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,729
but it's more specific because there are 24 different types.

132
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:56,960
So retention times are also taken into consideration in the lab.

133
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:05,640
And some more proposed changes are to start collecting urine and blood samples,

134
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:14,190
no urine samples instead of blood samples and hair samples instead because they're cheaper and noninvasive.

135
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:24,150
And we would develop a separate sampling frame or stratify data to compare past levels between households that use filters and those that don't.

136
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:28,049
And then we would start testing locally grown foods and drinks,

137
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:34,170
especially if they're shipped to see if we are impacting people's levels across the country as well.

138
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:43,530
And some strains are that collecting hair and urine samples instead are easier, faster and cheaper.

139
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:48,780
It's also a noninvasive way, and then having an approved population risk assessment.

140
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:54,210
Since testing would be local and more specific to that community.

141
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:03,910
So the limitations of the current plan currently deal with water testing, convenient sampling,

142
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:12,010
one stage cluster sampling and the fact that bio samples are currently sent to a lab in California for analysis.

143
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:14,350
As far as water testing goes,

144
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:22,930
there could be privacy concerns over testing officials entering private homes or being on their property for data collection and analysis.

145
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:29,890
And the cost of water testing is rather expensive at about $300 per sample.

146
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:36,790
Convenience sampling has limitations because it's prone to bias and it's not representative.

147
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:44,320
You can't use it to extrapolate one stage cluster sampling, whereas it is representative.

148
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:51,640
You can use census data and that data may be inaccurate because it's collected once every ten years.

149
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:59,889
And the fact that samples are sent to California means that shipping costs are typically going to be

150
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:08,260
quite high and there's only a 14 day stability and transport or storage which may impact analysis,

151
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:13,900
ultimately leading to underestimation of exposures.

152
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:24,700
Limitations of the proposed changes. Of course, if we're taking tissues from animals, we have to take into consideration that these animals roam.

153
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:27,819
They may not stay in the exact area that we're analyzing.

154
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:34,150
So that may not be an accurate, completely accurate telling of people's exposure in that area.

155
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:42,010
That's also expensive and requires more sampling and for utilizing jazz analysis to predict p force drift.

156
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:45,940
That just requires more costs and sampling as well. More analysis.

157
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:56,590
And then for our limitations to the investigation slash exposure assessment phase our and Haines data starts collecting data at the age of 12.

158
00:19:56,590 --> 00:20:04,510
So since we will be trying to compare data to children younger than the age of 12, there's just that limitation there with a comparison of data.

159
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:14,410
And then there's currently no health screening levels for specific P force, so interpreting individual P force concentrations is limited in use.

160
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:23,030
So cutting into some of the regulations and guidelines after our of exposure assessment here.

161
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:30,770
So we have in the state of Michigan, there are some maximum contaminant levels that have been identified.

162
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:36,350
These are primarily identified at the state level, and not even every state has identified these.

163
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:43,220
But for some of the major ones, PFOA, we've got eight parts per trillion and PFOA we've got 16.

164
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:47,060
We also had some additional ones added in December.

165
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:57,560
So as we talked about the jelly at the beginning, the responsibility is to test that drinking water, ground water, bodies, water, soil, waste water.

166
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,570
These are conducted in areas of interest and known as sites.

167
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:09,770
So the known ones are ones where, you know, we've identified exposure and contamination in the past, just checking in on them.

168
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:19,730
The areas of interest are determined by some extrapolation of data or requests, but that's kind of where our monitoring changes are going to come in.

169
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:23,660
Just better identifying those areas of interest, testing more areas,

170
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:26,899
and just kind of getting a better sense of what's actually going on as opposed

171
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:31,850
to just doing it based off request or just random information that pops up.

172
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:37,790
And the HHS and Department of Natural Resources are going to work on testing the

173
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:42,730
Fish and Wildlife and working with the local health department on advisories.

174
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:46,640
That's kind of where that intervention is going to come in.

175
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:51,380
These will also work with our increased monitoring efforts and our proposed plan.

176
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:55,369
In terms of the national guidelines.

177
00:21:55,370 --> 00:22:04,999
Like many of these chemicals, it's a little bit weak. The EPA right now, any of their statutory bodies, it's not identified as a hazard.

178
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,510
So there's not really much we can do about it that's required legally.

179
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:18,600
So the EPA and the FDA have more guidelines and initiatives, is not included as an official hazard in the Safe Drinking Water Act.

180
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:26,030
So again, legally, nothing is super enforceable, but they do have these unregulated contaminants monitoring,

181
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:36,050
monitoring rules which set some more guidelines of where monitoring is going to be required and just the levels regarding that.

182
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:40,040
And then we have the Toxic Substances Control Act,

183
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:48,710
and that's going to be where we get most of the regulation for not using PBS and newly made manufactured products like we discussed before.

184
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:58,400
So they have these significant new use rules like we kind of saw in that timeline that started in the early 2000 and has been expanding,

185
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:04,850
which is good. So we have just the notifications voluntary phase out covers a lot of them.

186
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:11,930
So that's a pretty good start, even though our regulation and monitoring isn't super legally enforced at the national level.

187
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:15,469
So in terms of those guidelines the EPA put out,

188
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:24,890
we can just kind of see here the reference doses for PFOA and PFOS and then the advisory notices we have there.

189
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:28,400
So it's kind of the best we have in terms of guiding this, of course.

190
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:33,860
Again, not enforceable, unfortunately, but that is what we have so far.

191
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:40,130
And we got all of our resources here and pretty much wraps it up.

192
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:47,270
So thanks, guys. Any questions?

193
00:23:52,090 --> 00:24:01,870
Yes. You mentioned sort of like the wildlife peace.

194
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:06,230
That's good. And you mentioned food. I missed you cover to frequently.

195
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:08,080
Did you say something else? What other types of food?

196
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:19,399
Oh, we kind of met like in packaging if there's a in that like if anything, like if there's farming going on or anything like that,

197
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:23,080
if that's contaminated food that gets shipped and sent out throughout the country.

198
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:32,500
So we know whether or not we'd have to broaden our plan to encompass a different sample size because of the readiness plan.

199
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:41,260
Also currently specifies that local health departments can interact with restaurants within areas or other companies

200
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:49,750
that utilize the potentially contaminated water for any of their procedures that lead to a finished food product.

201
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:56,820
Local health departments can work with them to figure out alternative methods to not utilizing.

202
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:04,630
You come across any particular types of foods that would be more likely to take the people and potentially.

203
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:11,740
No to certain types here, I would assume mostly focused on Bush.

204
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,020
I would assume things like in agriculture and things like grow and I'll take water.

205
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:23,320
That's very normal. Whereas if you have something where you just wash it with water, it's there.

206
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:30,850
The other issue is, you know, they use as fertilizer, a lot of different types of sludge is the things that make the concentration.

207
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:38,590
In my research, I came across some stuff about bio solid applications because we do see the silver and wastewater and you know,

208
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:41,920
we know it's just really hard to get out of things.

209
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:48,610
So a lot of the fields will be using that, those biosolids as fertilizer, and that just gets in it pretty easily.

210
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:52,830
But that's what we're asking.

211
00:25:55,060 --> 00:26:01,510
I like hearing, you know, trying to think outside the box a bit on the bio monitoring as far as different types of samples.

212
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:05,140
Were you able to locate a uranium method at all that people used?

213
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:11,379
Niger Not a specific one. I read a couple studies.

214
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:23,920
One of them was actually relating to detecting PFC in urine with people who had COVID 19 to kind of see how P fast exposure impacts COVID 19.

215
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:37,600
But I saw in recent years, it's kind of become a slightly more efficacious way to start collecting samples or analyze samples to determine exposure.

216
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:50,390
But it's still not as good as blood serum. And yeah, and specially when you think about the long chain versus the short chain that's focusing on.

217
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:56,800
One of the studies I cited on here actually said that it was from 2021,

218
00:26:56,810 --> 00:27:06,230
they were able to find PFOA, I think with like 98% accuracy, but PFOA was still 65%.

219
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:13,670
Yeah. Some of the metabolism and then some of these genetics.

220
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:18,870
Yeah, for sure. Yeah. Yeah. I think they're trying to use the hair samples.

221
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:24,920
I also saw a couple of studies, one stuck out from India, and that one,

222
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:32,090
I think had like a 99% success rate with detecting defects in hair, especially long term.

223
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:38,440
So I would. Oh, go ahead. I don't want to cut you off. Oh, please do.

224
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:43,090
Okay, you guys considering urinary biomarkers,

225
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:49,440
any thought towards wastewater surveillance and determine areas of interest to examine further is not applicable.

226
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:57,610
It's kind of a little bit, um, just in some of those like regulatory bodies we were discussing kind of more on the state level,

227
00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:05,409
those do wastewater a little bit, mostly focusing on groundwater and the bodies of water, but it is being tested.

228
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:09,490
Yeah. In method 8327 is specific for non drinking.

229
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:13,540
So wastewater treatment plants or water facilities.

230
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:17,440
So this is being used. I don't know how much.

231
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:22,790
Yeah. Actually.

232
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:30,459
So I like the description of the sampling strategy and the clustering to get a more representative sample.

233
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:40,350
That's great. Often. Oftentimes over most. Efforts like this from taking something they are experiencing of this devastating low participation rates,

234
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:47,040
especially when they want to collect the blood samples. So what do you what do you think about that?

235
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:50,990
Are there ways you think they can improve participation rates?

236
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:53,670
And how do you think that might impact sample?

237
00:28:55,140 --> 00:29:03,720
Part of that was suggesting the urine hair samples and the hair samples, mainly because they're less invasive to get done.

238
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:07,710
So to say, oh, I can't, like, give blood right now. Just just.

239
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:12,780
Yeah. Dancing. So piece of here.

240
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:24,420
Swag for participants. How does it maybe like a gift card or raffle or something that way?

241
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:28,280
Less expensive than the blood sample. Yeah, but it would still be less expensive.

242
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:36,250
Sometimes we have to get creative purchase presents because there's rules, so you can't make the amount you give them, like coercive.

243
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:40,870
Mm. But, you know, depending on the population, certain types of gifts.

244
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:48,430
So we 3000 other questions.

245
00:29:50,740 --> 00:30:08,390
All right. Thank you. I I'm going to ask both groups though for some yea, yea, yea, yea.

246
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:20,390
You know anything about it?

247
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:25,640
I know, I know. I just can't see it on my laptop.

248
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:34,970
I to see. And they were like.

249
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:47,930
Since there's only one. What I have to do is to.

250
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:07,900
Want to make 100.

251
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:20,940
I don't know if you know. I.

252
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:39,330
I want to change that. I used to have to do a lot of my own growth and it won't let me add another device for some reason.

253
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:47,800
So I get the calls that I was wondering why that is so close to home.

254
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:56,370
There is a seventh floor office in the tower and it would be the screen setting.

255
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:00,690
So yeah. Except for I don't think my notes are useful.

256
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:07,270
I guess I don't really know. Maybe I don't middle.

257
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:14,570
I usually do it once, even though I know the doing it.

258
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:26,280
It's still gets kind of boring. Answer others once you just don't read before everything works.

259
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:29,940
It's just like I feel the reverse of what it should be. But.

260
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:42,070
Oops. As soon as others.

261
00:32:53,070 --> 00:33:11,150
At that. Yes, there. This is the law that's really going to reverse, basically.

262
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:17,120
Okay. Let me go. All right.

263
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:24,230
We are group two. And today we'll be pitching our proposal for assessing children's exposure to pyrethroids in a northern Michigan town.

264
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:30,050
So we'll start out with an introduction or review our approach and methods for assessment.

265
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:33,740
Talk about some applicable regulations and then end with a brief conclusion.

266
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:40,700
So just an introduction to Pyrethroids. First, we'll introduce you to a scenario.

267
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:44,239
We have our town crier in Michigan here,

268
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:53,540
and it's a small town in northern Michigan where a pediatrician has been observing some neurodevelopmental delays among their patients.

269
00:33:53,540 --> 00:34:01,220
So they had two of their patients blood sent out to test for pyrethroids and found that levels were above the average U.S. population.

270
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:09,379
And now the state wants to do an exposure assessment to determine the extent of children's exposure and potential sources,

271
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:14,660
pathways and routes of exposure. As you can see on our map here, this is kind of the layout of our town.

272
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:20,420
To the north, we have an orchard. To the west, we have a large golf course.

273
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:24,110
And then to the south, we have a relatively new cannabis growing operation.

274
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:34,450
So what are pyrethroids? So pyrethrum is a naturally occurring pesticide found in some chrysanthemum.

275
00:34:34,450 --> 00:34:38,440
Flowers and its insecticidal properties were discovered in about 1800.

276
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:46,030
Powdery threads are a synthetic version of pyrethrum that have been developed to be more toxic and more persistent in the environment.

277
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:54,579
The first Pyrethroid was left there in that it was marketed in 1952 for the control of household insects.

278
00:34:54,580 --> 00:35:00,760
So they've been in use for a really long time. This is the mechanism of action.

279
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:11,739
So pyrethroids function by affecting nerve impulse transmission, mainly through their action on voltage and voltage sensitive sodium channels.

280
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:17,020
So you can see up at the top here we have a normal functioning sodium channel and neuron activity.

281
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:23,620
So the channels open, sodium goes in and then eventually as close to the sodium is being controlled,

282
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:27,490
the sodium goes through the neuron and we have a normal muscular contraction.

283
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:33,730
But with pyrethroids, they don't they prevent the closing of these channels.

284
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:39,550
So sodium is just constantly flooding in, which causes either repetitive firing or depolarization of the neuron,

285
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:43,599
which ultimately causes all these side effects in mammals.

286
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:50,879
But for insects, it kills them. So pyrethroids themselves are fairly toxic,

287
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:56,460
but in commercial mixtures there makes the synergies and carriers and solvents that make them more persistent in the environment,

288
00:35:56,820 --> 00:36:00,840
which ultimately results in a more toxic chemical.

289
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:08,010
But it's important to note that pyrethroids this this isn't a toxic chemical,

290
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:18,030
but relative to the other insecticides that are on the market historically and currently, it's has lower mammalian toxicity.

291
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,700
And generally biodegradability is better with this one.

292
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:31,459
So some physical and chemical properties of pyrethroids, they have a high optimal water partition coefficient,

293
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:36,830
so they're highly non-polar and they have a high affinity to soil and sediment.

294
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:43,760
So when they're sprayed on crops, they really bind to their soil, which prevents them from generally getting into the waterways freely.

295
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:49,580
So generally, unless there's a chemical spill, it doesn't really get into our water.

296
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:57,950
However, the photo will great. And the degradation rate in soil is variable and really depends on the specific mixture of chemicals.

297
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:10,010
So it it can have a half life in soil from 3 to 96 days, just depending on the specific mixture.

298
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:16,659
So those physical and chemical properties of these mixtures, depending on what they're mixed with,

299
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:19,660
again, makes them either less or more persistent in the environment.

300
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:22,780
And of course, for agricultural uses,

301
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:30,190
the more persistent ones tend to be used because you don't want to spray an insecticide on your plants and then have it just biodegrade rapidly.

302
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:32,230
You want it to stick around so that it can be used.

303
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:39,880
So how do I read through to enter the environment generally through an agriculture applications on crops and livestock,

304
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:45,580
and also their use commonly in residential insecticides on sprays and aerosol bombs.

305
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:56,980
But some specific exposures that can be kind of scenario specific, I guess it's pyrethroids are commonly used in lice treatments,

306
00:37:57,490 --> 00:38:03,730
permethrin, which is a mosquito repellent that sprayed on clothing and mosquito nets as well as dog flea and tick treatments.

307
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:10,479
So how did Pyrethroids from the Environment enter children's bodies?

308
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:17,140
So primarily most people, including children, are exposed to the ingestion typically of food, fruits and vegetables.

309
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:22,380
The second most common is inhalation, especially shortly after it's been sprayed on crops.

310
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:28,870
And then finally less common is dermal. Just because it doesn't penetrate the skin very well.

311
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:39,700
So occupationally, this is more of a concern. Or in children who are living in households that commonly use parathyroid insecticides.

312
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:48,100
But also children. They tend to become dehydrated more easily through exercise and illness, so that makes their skin more penetrable.

313
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:52,300
So that kind of puts them at an increased risk of dermal exposure.

314
00:38:53,470 --> 00:39:01,150
As for distribution and metabolism, it does have a really, Perry points out a really short metabolic clearance,

315
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:06,580
16 to 24 hours, which typically makes them less toxic because they're not going to build up in your system.

316
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:12,300
But like I've said about a lot of other properties of pyrethroids, it really depends on the mixture.

317
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:23,760
So I think it's Fan Valley rate, for example, is one that has been found to be really highly accumulated in fat tissue.

318
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:28,000
That's more lipophilic than the others. So it depends on the specific mixture.

319
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:36,240
As for clinical manifestations, for acute exposures, we know a lot about this, but chronic exposure is especially in children.

320
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:44,470
There is not a lot of research, especially outside of the last couple of years for endpoints outside of carcinogenicity.

321
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:50,889
So there have been some recent studies showing that there are potential neurodevelopmental

322
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:58,600
interferences and an increased risk of ADHD for children who are chronically exposed to pyrethroids.

323
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:03,680
And one of the bigger,

324
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:16,100
more recent studies that have been pushed just this year is a systematic review evaluating 25 epidemiologic studies on exposure to pyrethroids in.

325
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:22,549
I think pregnancy, women exposed during pregnancy and then early childhood.

326
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:30,830
And they concluded that these rates are likely neurotoxic events for children exposed both prenatally and in early childhood.

327
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:35,630
So it's definitely a relevant concern right now, but we don't have a lot of information.

328
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:42,900
Okay. So the next step in our proposal is the Approach and methods section.

329
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:54,960
So for the exposure assessment methodology, our objective with this assessment is to essentially determine the risk characterization for this town.

330
00:40:55,650 --> 00:41:03,600
Based on the anecdotal evidence that was received. So we decided to follow the EPA human health risk assessment guideline.

331
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:08,310
That's a four step process, with the first one being just hazard identification.

332
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:14,580
And for our specific situation, the stressor was identified to be the synthetic pyrethroid pesticides.

333
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:18,690
And essentially in this step, you determine what are the human health effects.

334
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:27,210
And in our situation, it's the young children and infants that are of most concern due to animal studies supporting risk of developmental delays.

335
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:37,140
And then in non occupational environments such as this community, the major form of or rate of exposure would be ingestion from,

336
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:42,720
as Haley mentioned, produce and other food consumption and also application at the home.

337
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:54,030
And then also step two of our process will be just establishing the dose response relationship and seeing if the chemical is of concern.

338
00:41:54,030 --> 00:42:02,400
And then in an oral application of these pesticides in a rat study, it was determined that there's a linear dose response relationship.

339
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:09,300
So essentially what that means is that this chemical, like theoretically at any level has a risk,

340
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:12,720
even though it's small but finite of being a carcinogen.

341
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:19,080
And then ultimately, it will move into the next phase of exposure assessment, which will be outlined more on further slides.

342
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:23,170
But our objective with this step would be to basically quantify the magnitudes,

343
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:26,640
the frequency and duration of the exposure to the pesticides in the community.

344
00:42:27,270 --> 00:42:34,649
And then finally, the risk characterization of basically giving a risk estimation and also a risk description to the community,

345
00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:41,460
including any ways to reduce exposure if it comes out of concern.

346
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:48,220
So as her specifics, the first step is just narrowing in on the exposure profile.

347
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:53,350
Once again, our target population is that infants and young children in this community.

348
00:42:53,650 --> 00:43:00,800
Children are just naturally at a higher risk due to higher interest rates and also more contact with contaminated surfaces.

349
00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:07,150
As you can see in my very scientific diagram, kids playing dirt and ultimately usually end up putting it in their mouth.

350
00:43:07,690 --> 00:43:11,019
So specifically in our study,

351
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:19,150
the media that we're going to be looking at as possibly contaminated are food like from a local store or even the orchard soil,

352
00:43:19,870 --> 00:43:28,540
drinking water and also consumer products. And then within these media, the application or sources of contamination are the intentional application,

353
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:32,620
for example, in like residential homes or even outside of residential homes.

354
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:39,100
Also, like I said, the deposition of the actual particulate matter like dust and other objects into edible produce,

355
00:43:39,430 --> 00:43:46,930
and then ultimately persistent environmental accumulation of this pesticide in soil and drinking water.

356
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:58,780
And so for the planet, the qualitative aspect of our exposure assessment for looking at specific data collection activities,

357
00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:03,669
including conducting an interview with a pediatrician that reported this and

358
00:44:03,670 --> 00:44:07,850
understanding the thought process and why the connection was made between the neuro,

359
00:44:08,110 --> 00:44:15,040
the the developmental delays and the actual concern.

360
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:20,080
And then ultimately you are going to consult with and likely analyze the local industries,

361
00:44:20,770 --> 00:44:28,059
including just determining what type of pesticides are used at these facilities and what their industry standard is.

362
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:37,090
And also look for application, but also disposal of the chemicals and then also using regulatory requirements to our advantage.

363
00:44:37,090 --> 00:44:42,760
For example, at CRI, which is the Emergency Planning and Committee or Community Right to Know Act,

364
00:44:43,810 --> 00:44:51,490
where essentially if you have on site any hazardous materials and that's classified as anything that needs MSDS and certain qualities,

365
00:44:51,490 --> 00:44:54,760
you have to report it to the state, but you're also required to have an inventory.

366
00:44:54,760 --> 00:45:01,299
So using that documentation to find out what is being used at the sites and then additionally working

367
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:06,460
with Egle compliance officers because more than likely if there is industrial use of pesticides,

368
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:09,159
eagle, which is the Michigan EPA,

369
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:18,910
is going to know about it and likely just finding out if there's any like site history that's relevant or past exposure assessments,

370
00:45:18,910 --> 00:45:22,120
even just using that as additional data points.

371
00:45:22,870 --> 00:45:30,070
And then ultimately we're going to be administering a survey to the community to find out

372
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:36,370
certain data points that will be relevant and building the actual exposure profile like,

373
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:45,970
like household size, where the children attend school, any symptoms, where do the employees or this where do the actual community members work?

374
00:45:46,870 --> 00:45:56,319
And then ultimately in specifically the two kids that have the higher level in the urine looking at what household products are used

375
00:45:56,320 --> 00:46:05,709
in that home and then also identifying any possible confounding exposures if this is basically another relevant pathway to take,

376
00:46:05,710 --> 00:46:14,650
if there's no pesticide concern in the community understanding that, yes, these children are enduring developmental delays,

377
00:46:14,650 --> 00:46:18,160
but it might be something like lead exposure in the home eating chips,

378
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:27,070
etc. And once the quality of side of the sampling strategy is done, move more into the quantitative.

379
00:46:27,070 --> 00:46:34,570
And this is determined to be like a two part process with bio monitoring to determine what the children are actually like,

380
00:46:34,570 --> 00:46:36,940
their dose, what they're actually having in their bodies.

381
00:46:37,180 --> 00:46:46,660
And this would be done via urine and quantifying the pyrethroid metabolites in the urine and this would be done via the mouse method.

382
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:50,530
And then the next step would be environmental sampling of like the food,

383
00:46:50,530 --> 00:46:56,710
the soil, the water for specifically fruit and soil would be like surface tests.

384
00:46:57,160 --> 00:47:04,360
And then the two chemicals or pesticides that we're focusing on are the self-hatred and the cyber mathurin.

385
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:08,230
And these were picked because they're persistent in the environment and are commonly

386
00:47:08,230 --> 00:47:13,510
used pyrethroid pesticides as a whole are like over a thousand of pesticides.

387
00:47:13,510 --> 00:47:21,880
So these are basically going to indicate in theory, if these are present, there's going to be the other classes of presence as well.

388
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:24,220
And then specifically for analytical method.

389
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:31,930
So you throw in is determined by reverse phase, high pressure liquid chromatography done with the V detector.

390
00:47:31,930 --> 00:47:38,470
And then similarly the safer method is the high pressure liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection as well.

391
00:47:38,830 --> 00:47:42,910
And then also for future reference, if there's a concern identified in the environment,

392
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:46,780
there's probably going to be another aspect in the occupational realm.

393
00:47:47,110 --> 00:47:52,569
So just for reference, Nilesh and OSHA have analytical methods for quantifying that exposure,

394
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:58,870
but that's definitely more on the inhalation route as people who are actually applying the pesticides.

395
00:47:59,410 --> 00:48:06,310
And then once we gather all that information, go into the calculations of adjusting the average daily dose for surface residue,

396
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:16,540
and then these will be adjusted for like ingestion, rate, body weight, etc. based on the Exposure Factors Handbook from the EPA.

397
00:48:18,690 --> 00:48:22,290
Okay to talk a little more of those environmental assessment.

398
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:26,400
So the first entertainment kind of thing, Richard, a couple of questions to ask you.

399
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:30,870
Firstly, it was the two children of Axis Orchard. Are they picking their own apples?

400
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:37,709
Just determining if those two trees would be fair on those apples or if not all the apples locally

401
00:48:37,710 --> 00:48:48,180
to that positive contributor to the local increasing or neurodevelopmental slowness or if not.

402
00:48:49,230 --> 00:48:53,520
Of course, obviously, we're going to ask them what they're using, how they applied, all that sort of stuff.

403
00:48:53,910 --> 00:49:01,360
So our main concerns of exposure for migraines, exposure, this area would be substitute for the wash apples on soil,

404
00:49:01,590 --> 00:49:04,650
solid clothes and then inhalation just for dust downwind.

405
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:14,430
So the golf course. So when we ask asked what assets they use, do children have access to this facility?

406
00:49:14,430 --> 00:49:19,740
Is it open to have parents working there and then really tracking home soil and dirty clothes, stuff like that?

407
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:25,259
So possible exposure to construct that we saw from some of the clothes and that in relation to spray or dust,

408
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:31,050
if done with an area or second class area boots or what would be the cash facility.

409
00:49:31,470 --> 00:49:35,060
Obviously the children should have access to that and they shouldn't be just in.

410
00:49:35,070 --> 00:49:37,680
Give us a we. It's a bigger problem than just us.

411
00:49:38,490 --> 00:49:44,040
So mostly consider the pesticides they're using and how they're applying them and if there's any, you know, inhalation spray dust downwind.

412
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:49,650
So again, possible exposure, concern over the soil from civilian clothes and then inhalation is fairy dust.

413
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:55,770
The final areas we're gonna want to look at is not those industrial areas, but it's general areas.

414
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:00,750
Well, first of all, there are times which their homes, schools, parks, recreation centers,

415
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:05,340
anywhere that the children would gather a lot would be getting those exposures.

416
00:50:05,950 --> 00:50:13,070
So if we can get information on how many kids have been suffering from, so it would be helpful to kind of try and map out where they live,

417
00:50:13,090 --> 00:50:19,229
see if there's any sort of pattern of other local exposure would be also concerned about would be residential insecticides,

418
00:50:19,230 --> 00:50:23,130
light treatments, cedar repellents, pet sprays, all things that range from the intro.

419
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:29,670
So we'll look at those and test those. And again, the local water source, well, make sure that it hasn't been contaminated.

420
00:50:30,850 --> 00:50:39,150
So somewhere in the test that we're doing test the water test or just the surface of apples, the surface throughout the orchard.

421
00:50:39,570 --> 00:50:48,270
So if we want to take surface samples of clothes or boats, we set anything for a home and we'd want to take samples of soil from the common areas.

422
00:50:52,570 --> 00:50:56,050
We're going to compare those results when I was.

423
00:50:56,620 --> 00:51:06,340
There are some international guidelines for parents. The International Agency for Research on Cancer classified three parents or two groups?

424
00:51:06,350 --> 00:51:12,580
Two group groups, three, which means that they are not classifiable as to be AIDS.

425
00:51:15,050 --> 00:51:30,670
Now I say no gymnast to humans, and the W.H.O. recommended that the level of Hamas reign in drinking water not exceed 20 macro micrograms per liter.

426
00:51:31,390 --> 00:51:33,140
Yeah. Next expertise.

427
00:51:33,940 --> 00:51:47,140
There are also some national guidelines for references to HGH and Nelson and Osaka stated level of reference in what they desire.

428
00:51:47,410 --> 00:51:54,250
The occupational exposure limits for an eight hour workday on a 40 hour work week.

429
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:59,950
Five milligrams per cubic meter expertise.

430
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:08,260
And the EPA has recommended of daily oral exposure limits for ten different parasitic pyrethroids.

431
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:18,880
And this is name is range from 0.4520.05 milligrams per kilogram per day.

432
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:33,450
Well. And in September of 1997, the EPA issued a request to pesticide formulators to change the terms,

433
00:52:33,730 --> 00:52:37,810
nurture the ingredients to other ingredients and pesticide labels.

434
00:52:38,050 --> 00:52:44,800
Because the general public health and really fascinating arts and ingredients and meanings, harmonies and readings.

435
00:52:45,130 --> 00:52:51,600
Since the federal law started to define the emerging varieties on the basis of the top dog,

436
00:52:51,640 --> 00:53:00,160
so toxicity of hazards to humans, it should not be assumed that diets that all ingredients are nontoxic.

437
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:04,700
The EPA published a list of all the ingredients in the.

438
00:53:04,740 --> 00:53:14,010
It is the encounter that you just heard. It asks for the pesticides where you evaluate the pesticide on the ground.

439
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:29,079
Often authority granted in two major statutes the federal insecticide fungicide and rolling in the that ordinance aside acts and the Federal Food,

440
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:37,930
Drug and Cosmetic Act. The federal law requires all pesticides sold or distributed in the United States,

441
00:53:37,930 --> 00:53:44,410
including imported and pesticides to be registered by EPA and the FTC.

442
00:53:45,190 --> 00:53:53,340
FTC A requires us to use that pesticide tolerance for all pesticide use the in or out

443
00:53:53,360 --> 00:54:02,409
food in a manner that will result in the residue in or on food and feed intolerance.

444
00:54:02,410 --> 00:54:11,470
Stated that the maximum permissible level for pesticide residues allowed in human food and animal feed.

445
00:54:15,470 --> 00:54:18,680
So in conclusion, some of the strengths and limitations of our method,

446
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:22,940
the strength is it's a pretty comprehensive exposure assessment to be able to look at a

447
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:26,290
lot of potential sources and hopefully determine where the chemicals are coming from.

448
00:54:27,830 --> 00:54:32,060
We will need to be able to accept their findings into recommendation and this review will help with that.

449
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:36,110
And then because we're making a recommendation, there'll be time.

450
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:39,169
And so committee members will be able voiced concerns.

451
00:54:39,170 --> 00:54:46,190
And in fact, the process, the limitations, of course, the actual evidence was the basis of finished report.

452
00:54:46,190 --> 00:54:54,139
We only have one pediatrician's word for it. It's not ideal has been a ton of money just based on that is challenging to effect the true

453
00:54:54,140 --> 00:54:58,490
exposure patterns and there is some uncertainty when it's reading concentration for reference.

454
00:54:59,990 --> 00:55:06,050
Of course, somewhat difficult to distinguish site specific contamination of history and background concerns.

455
00:55:06,620 --> 00:55:10,310
And finally, research regarding central health subjects is relatively new.

456
00:55:10,910 --> 00:55:18,060
And so, you know, we hope that was a little more fresh. Thank you.

457
00:55:21,770 --> 00:55:40,960
Questions from the committee. I might have some, but a good job not chasing the clues of the golf course.

458
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:45,909
I like the golf course because a lot of people don't take this class.

459
00:55:45,910 --> 00:55:49,809
You know, they me go directly to those. So I like how you thought.

460
00:55:49,810 --> 00:55:55,410
Firestone pediatrician. And I think think about those residential exposure.

461
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:59,460
So to dig in a little bit more, what kinds of questions would you ask of?

462
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:06,400
So in the in the original scenario, if you recall, is to high levels that were measured in it was a a brother and a sister.

463
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:16,240
What kinds of questions would you would you ask? I know specifically what we thinking of is just understanding what they use in the home and

464
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:22,030
then also kind of following the questionnaire outline like what your parents do for work.

465
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:30,170
Where do you go? Basically just trying to establish more than likely it's residential use.

466
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:34,660
So just trying to figure out and hopefully variety recommendations on how to use it.

467
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:43,240
As for the pediatrician, I would just one. More about what they're seeing.

468
00:56:44,870 --> 00:56:49,020
And a lot of members just. You have high levels and we're seeing a lot.

469
00:56:50,660 --> 00:56:55,430
Issues. So just wondering what what the neurodevelopmental issues are.

470
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:08,589
Because you have a lot of clinicians who do great work, but they're not trained in public health.

471
00:57:08,590 --> 00:57:15,159
So, you know, they don't maybe they haven't taken classes on treatments and things like that.

472
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:19,879
So. You anecdotal versus. Representative information.

473
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:27,990
Sometimes there's a there's a gap. The, uh, the biomarkers.

474
00:57:28,620 --> 00:57:33,300
So you said you'd do some blood monitoring. Would you compare those concentrations to.

475
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:42,840
I'm. So I didn't have anything specifically to do compared to is more for detection.

476
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:52,950
Um, and that's why I found the limitations. Just one of them was distinguishing between just background concentration and actual concerning levels.

477
00:57:53,830 --> 00:58:00,389
Um, so I have nothing directly to compare to other than the occasional loss which aren't necessarily relevant.

478
00:58:00,390 --> 00:58:04,800
So there's just a lack of actual regulatory stuff to compare to.

479
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:12,320
So this is where in Heinz the previous group mentioned, and so they only clip blood down to 12, but just click here and up to six.

480
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:17,040
So. They do measures compare this distribution.

481
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:20,849
I mean, it's not that far, but it at least gives you some indicator.

482
00:58:20,850 --> 00:58:23,399
And then what I do is probably dig into the literature,

483
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:27,600
some of the epidemiologic studies that have been done in what kinds of distributions are these?

484
00:58:35,250 --> 00:58:40,840
There you go. There's one. I'm sorry you guys got into this.

485
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:46,260
You're talking about how they are persistent because you don't want something that just degrades, kind of.

486
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:50,040
Do you know, like, how long that persistence lasts?

487
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:53,940
And, like, kind of how long is it a concern for the concern levels?

488
00:58:54,120 --> 00:59:04,199
Yeah, I briefly touched on it. Um, so there is a lot of info on how long it last through soils on the soil both of and how fast it degrades.

489
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:05,610
Really depends on the mixtures.

490
00:59:05,790 --> 00:59:12,689
Um, because there's the high returns, but then there's all this other stuff that's mixed with it to make it last longer in the environment.

491
00:59:12,690 --> 00:59:21,240
So anywhere from three to I think only seven days is how long it takes to degrade the soil.

492
00:59:21,810 --> 00:59:27,660
Most of them are also they degrade just with contact with sunlight.

493
00:59:28,290 --> 00:59:33,110
Most of them are just one or two days in the air, like through through that.

494
00:59:33,180 --> 00:59:37,400
So the timing of application does kind of. Quite an effect on exposure.

495
00:59:38,030 --> 00:59:45,140
You can see. Yeah, but it's mainly just the specific chemical properties of these specific insecticides that they're using.

496
00:59:47,390 --> 00:59:53,520
Yeah. Just to follow up on that, I'm curious, um, so if you think it might have been like a residential exposure,

497
00:59:53,540 --> 00:59:59,330
do you know if there would be a difference in like how long it would take to degrade the used residential versus agricultural?

498
01:00:00,330 --> 01:00:07,440
It's a really good question. I mean, I'm sure it depends on which type of thought is used to which substance is put in.

499
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:14,669
There's a lot of variables, and that's it's hard to say. What do you do with your stuff?

500
01:00:14,670 --> 01:00:18,870
You find you think it can persist as ballast for quite a while?

501
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:23,700
Yeah, right. That's what they found in indoor environments because it's not exposed to a lot of sunlight.

502
01:00:23,790 --> 01:00:27,110
Yes, sure they can. You can find really high levels.

503
01:00:27,130 --> 01:00:32,960
Very pretty doesn't. Yeah. That's right.

504
01:00:33,060 --> 01:00:35,680
Yes, that's what we did, focused mainly on ingestion,

505
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:39,370
because that's more than likely like the little kid isn't going to be out spreading the pesticide.

506
01:00:39,610 --> 01:00:45,690
They're going to be more. So, yeah, that's a concern.

507
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:53,829
But yes, that's why we did focus on because I know the pediatrician was and totally connecting the two,

508
01:00:53,830 --> 01:00:58,090
but it was more of, at least in my eyes, a concern in the home.

509
01:00:58,930 --> 01:01:01,690
That's why I didn't put like focus on the questionnaire, too.

510
01:01:03,730 --> 01:01:10,260
Not sure if you had done this radical, but did you look into what kinds of pesticides are used typically in orchards or cannabis grown?

511
01:01:10,690 --> 01:01:19,060
Golf courses. I did. I found yeah, I was going to put it out, but I decided in like for a time I cut it out.

512
01:01:19,070 --> 01:01:24,550
But yeah, there's that's why there is industry standards for like cannabis and orchards and um,

513
01:01:25,030 --> 01:01:28,240
so I just kind of put in a point to look at those, but I didn't actually want.

514
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:36,030
The Saudis. Because there have been. Expansion of canvas, for example.

515
01:01:37,620 --> 01:01:40,560
It's all over the place now. So it would be interesting to know.

516
01:01:43,150 --> 01:01:48,580
And you know, he said, I play golf and some of these really fancy courses like Bill Banks and all this time,

517
01:01:49,270 --> 01:01:54,760
oh, I'll be playing some if I like to do that.

518
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:58,940
So. Other questions from this group.

519
01:02:00,610 --> 01:02:05,500
Future research themes and subjects. I know religion.

520
01:02:05,820 --> 01:02:14,580
Yeah. I mean, it's just a lot of animal studies. So, like, for even that normal or neurodevelopmental delays kind of set the target like it's likely.

521
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:22,950
So just more research needed and it just seems like in a lot of exposure assessments,

522
01:02:22,950 --> 01:02:27,419
carcinogenicity is like the only endpoint that anyone cares about.

523
01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:30,780
So it's always really thoroughly investigated, but.

524
01:02:33,530 --> 01:02:39,110
In human studies of carcinogenicity with chemicals are really difficult to.

525
01:02:44,330 --> 01:02:50,540
All right. Good job, everybody. I want to thank you all for taking this class and a lot of it is probably required.

526
01:02:52,250 --> 01:02:56,930
Thanks for hanging with me all semester. It's been great having you and hopefully you learned a thing or two.

527
01:02:56,930 --> 01:03:01,490
And I did. And of course, have a good break next semester.

528
01:03:02,540 --> 01:03:05,540
Yeah. And fun for you guys.

529
01:03:11,140 --> 01:03:22,810
Don't forget the fear assessment, because here's a little step one I have.

530
01:03:25,580 --> 01:03:31,800
The generic. Right.

531
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:37,420
Because even during the politics years later. Yeah.

532
01:03:37,770 --> 01:03:43,870
Yeah. When I was underground.

533
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:44,912
Before I got.
