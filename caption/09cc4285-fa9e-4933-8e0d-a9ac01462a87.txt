Hi, I'm Melissa Creary and
I study health policy and

3
00:00:17,579 --> 00:00:22,490
the relationship between the state and
social movements.

4
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:27,010
Government's role in healthcare is
pervasive and will continue to be so.

5
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:30,940
In the United States, governments
at all levels, federal, state, and

6
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:34,940
local, have responsibility to create
conditions in which its citizens can be

7
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:37,460
as healthy as possible.

8
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:41,890
In this unit, I'll explain when and
why intervention should be considered,

9
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:44,670
the legal role for government
involvement on both the federal and

10
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:48,880
state level, institutional structures
of the public health system,

11
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:53,610
including the federal, state, local,
and other structures, stakeholders and

12
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:58,520
interest groups, and major challenges
seen within the public health system.

13
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:02,340
A strong and effective public health
infrastructure is essential to respond to

14
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:07,130
health crises and address challenges
like preventing chronic illness,

15
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:11,940
controlling infectious disease, and
monitoring safety of food and water.

16
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:13,840
But who has the authority?

17
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,550
Let's start at the beginning with
the United States Constitution.

18
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:21,460
The Preamble to the US Constitution
states, one of the fundamental

19
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:24,950
purposes of government is to
promote the general welfare.

20
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:28,130
Well how was general welfare
interpreted exactly?

21
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:28,850
This is still up for

22
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:34,300
discussion since health is not mentioned
anywhere in the US Constitution.

23
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:37,930
In the Tenth Amendment however,
it states, The powers not delegated to

24
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:42,940
the United States by the Constitution,
nor prohibited by it to the States,

25
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:47,410
are reserved to the States respectively,
or to the people".

26
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:50,070
So what this means is that
the Federal Government doesn't have

27
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:51,750
ultimate responsibility.

28
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:55,282
So this plays out in many
ways on the state level.
