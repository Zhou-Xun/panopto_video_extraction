1
00:00:02,735 --> 00:00:15,665
Thank you for returning diligently for lunch. So I am happy to announce our first annual inaugural student speaker competition.

2
00:00:15,735 --> 00:00:20,585
Like I said, everybody's like, Oh, I did this for the people that did all the work.

3
00:00:21,145 --> 00:00:31,535
Oh. So we had it with ten applicants to the competition and they were scored by three people.

4
00:00:33,035 --> 00:00:36,694
Not me. I was not one. But using the rubric.

5
00:00:36,695 --> 00:00:42,125
Those of you taking my class, using a scoring rubric that was developed by me that was standardized.

6
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:51,975
And so we've got our three top scores are going to be presenting to you today their research in the interest of, I think, time and flow.

7
00:00:52,295 --> 00:00:57,905
I'm going to have Aaron and then Gregory and then Hannah all present and then take a

8
00:00:57,905 --> 00:01:02,435
seat up here when you're finished and we'll do questions and answers for everybody.

9
00:01:04,055 --> 00:01:13,955
So with that, all ready.

10
00:01:14,165 --> 00:01:17,865
Everyone in here. Okay, ready?

11
00:01:18,605 --> 00:01:23,855
I'm going to be presenting some recent work that was completed over the summer,

12
00:01:24,885 --> 00:01:28,685
besides with SARS-CoV-2 and a household study that we have done in Nicaragua.

13
00:01:31,325 --> 00:01:36,845
So just as some some general background, many children have already been infected with SARS-CoV-2.

14
00:01:37,355 --> 00:01:43,565
Vaccine availability for kids has been limited, and when available, uptake has also been limited.

15
00:01:44,495 --> 00:01:49,205
These kinds of factors is what contributes to the wide number of infections in children.

16
00:01:50,465 --> 00:01:55,805
Children have always kind of been an interest of mine. I have three and expecting our fourth already.

17
00:01:56,645 --> 00:02:02,944
So I've always kind of honed in on the kids. Yes, it's a lot, but I really like it.

18
00:02:02,945 --> 00:02:10,115
And it's been it's been interesting to work with children, the data from children, and then focus my research also on them.

19
00:02:11,795 --> 00:02:16,955
There's also some mixed evidence about the contribution of prevention to transmission.

20
00:02:17,645 --> 00:02:21,754
Broadly, it's kind of accepted that kids are less infectious than adults.

21
00:02:21,755 --> 00:02:27,725
But some recent studies that use some more sophisticated modeling methods suggest that may not be the case.

22
00:02:28,025 --> 00:02:31,175
So there's there's a little bit of conflict there.

23
00:02:31,835 --> 00:02:34,625
And then the effect of infection induced immunity.

24
00:02:34,635 --> 00:02:42,335
So what children primarily have because of the lack of access to vaccines on SARS-CoV-2 transmission has not been well established.

25
00:02:44,105 --> 00:02:50,525
We've talked a little bit at earlier in the day about SARS-CoV-2 transition into an endemic city.

26
00:02:50,525 --> 00:02:56,045
And children as this as this transition occurs, are going to represent the greatest proportion of primary cases.

27
00:02:56,345 --> 00:03:01,175
We're going to see more and more more and more children cases as as time goes on.

28
00:03:01,745 --> 00:03:07,535
So we need to really understand the association between infection induced immunity and SARS-CoV-2, between transmission,

29
00:03:08,195 --> 00:03:16,925
as well as just general transmission by children to to inform how this transition to having SARS-CoV-2 to be fully endemic is going to occur.

30
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:20,825
And so these, like I mentioned, these are results from an ongoing community,

31
00:03:21,065 --> 00:03:27,255
community based household transmission study Managua, Nicaragua, from June 2020 to June 2022.

32
00:03:27,575 --> 00:03:37,125
Pretty recent data. This work was supported by grants and contracts from from the NIH that were awarded to Omri Gordon.

33
00:03:37,305 --> 00:03:42,225
It was my mentor to talk a little bit about the study design of the credit.

34
00:03:42,225 --> 00:03:48,075
I had MER research scientist in our group for creating these figures that everyone

35
00:03:48,075 --> 00:03:51,675
now just uses repeatedly because they're great explanations of how it works.

36
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:59,864
So we have a we have a family, a household cohort, so a group of people living within one household that are monitored over time.

37
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:07,655
When somebody presents to the study clinic with fever or symptoms of respiratory disease, they are tested for influenza and SARS-CoV-2.

38
00:04:08,235 --> 00:04:13,185
If they are positive for either of those, they enter into an intensive monitoring period.

39
00:04:13,195 --> 00:04:19,805
So this this diagram right here is is the sampling frame for SARS-CoV-2.

40
00:04:19,815 --> 00:04:27,825
So all participants that consent within the household then have a respiratory sample collected on the first day,

41
00:04:28,575 --> 00:04:36,285
three days, 714 2130 with the idea of truly trying to capture a transmission that's occurring within the household.

42
00:04:36,585 --> 00:04:40,005
In addition, we have symptom diaries that are collected daily,

43
00:04:41,145 --> 00:04:46,305
and this really again allows us to hone in on transmission dynamics with within the household setting.

44
00:04:48,065 --> 00:04:57,784
So those that are, you know, more familiar with kind of the math and statistics of household studies, this isn't anything new,

45
00:04:57,785 --> 00:05:05,944
but it's been not widely implemented by traditional epidemiologists that statistical transmission models do a much

46
00:05:05,945 --> 00:05:16,075
better job at really honing in on the probability of of the infection given contact than any other kind of models.

47
00:05:16,085 --> 00:05:19,025
Other models, the traditional regression models,

48
00:05:19,025 --> 00:05:24,545
will inflate statistics and make it such that you can't really interpret it as a as a probability of transmission.

49
00:05:25,655 --> 00:05:34,595
But these these statistical transmission models of what your pairwise model is, they allow us to get a much better estimate and how to hone in.

50
00:05:34,655 --> 00:05:40,785
And there are less bias in that in that regard. Additionally, a lot of concern with household studies is, okay,

51
00:05:40,865 --> 00:05:45,365
you're looking at transmission within a household context, but what about people who travel outside of the household?

52
00:05:45,365 --> 00:05:53,674
Can infections be introduced from there? So these models simultaneously can account for that risk of infection from outside the household.

53
00:05:53,675 --> 00:06:01,295
So we're really kind of honing in on a variety of different areas of bias to to address them, to to look at the factors that we're interested in.

54
00:06:01,685 --> 00:06:04,865
So we we estimate household secondary attack risk,

55
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:14,705
which is that probability of transmission or infection given contact with somebody that's infectious and then also rate ratio.

56
00:06:14,705 --> 00:06:17,885
So we presented and the other and relative scales.

57
00:06:18,665 --> 00:06:23,495
And again, the secondary attack risk can be interpreted as the probability of transmission.

58
00:06:25,095 --> 00:06:33,645
So during this time period, we had just about 2400 active participants, almost 300 household activations,

59
00:06:34,095 --> 00:06:44,385
just under 1200 household contacts with within those 300 household activations, of which about 41% of participants were PCR positive.

60
00:06:45,225 --> 00:06:52,725
So this little figure right here shows the presents of households within kind of brackets of transmission.

61
00:06:52,725 --> 00:06:57,735
So a large proportion, about 28%, we didn't see any transmission.

62
00:06:57,735 --> 00:06:59,894
So we have the primary case within the household,

63
00:06:59,895 --> 00:07:08,115
but know no other household members who are infected all the way up to 75% plus where you have about 22%.

64
00:07:08,505 --> 00:07:15,435
So we have kind of these kind of extremes. You either have very little transmission or a lot of transmission,

65
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:19,935
which is which is relatively consistent with what we've seen with super spreader events.

66
00:07:20,295 --> 00:07:26,085
There are some people that are just incredibly more infectious than others and higher and spread the virus rapidly.

67
00:07:26,835 --> 00:07:31,605
And then again, there's lots of people that are not as infectious for a variety of different reasons.

68
00:07:31,605 --> 00:07:38,225
And so you don't you don't those that are spread or get into some reasons why this is why this may be occurring,

69
00:07:39,945 --> 00:07:49,515
recognize that this is a little small. But these are these are the result our overall results from these pairwise statistical transmission models.

70
00:07:49,845 --> 00:07:56,955
So we estimated the secondary attack risk and then also the rate ratios which on the underpinnings they

71
00:07:57,075 --> 00:08:03,285
accelerated fairly over time models if anyone wants to know really what's kind of going on under the hood there.

72
00:08:03,795 --> 00:08:11,745
So the way to look at this, we have two blue boxes. We have factors associated with infectiousness and factors associated with susceptibility.

73
00:08:12,555 --> 00:08:20,085
So during this time period overall, we saw about a 13% chance of infection giving contact for all people.

74
00:08:20,415 --> 00:08:25,755
So if I'm infectious and I have a meaningful contact with you in the household over this time period,

75
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:29,205
there's about a 13% chance that you would become infected.

76
00:08:29,435 --> 00:08:36,315
That's how I interpret this. We see a decreased probability of transmission by age.

77
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:45,284
So we see that those that are 11 plus are the are the most infectious, then followed by 5 to 10 and then 0 to 4 asymptomatic infections,

78
00:08:45,285 --> 00:08:53,325
which is something that we that we long know have known are much more likely to be infectious contacts that results in infection.

79
00:08:53,335 --> 00:09:02,055
So we see about 17% of those results in infection, whereas just about 1% of asymptomatic contact results.

80
00:09:02,595 --> 00:09:13,125
So you see this very wide gap. You look at our rate ratio of 24.4 that really hones in on truly symptomatic.

81
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:17,775
Individuals are a lot more infectious than that, asymptomatic about 24 times more.

82
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:23,145
So again, we wanted to focus on prior infections.

83
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:34,634
We did not see, unfortunately, any protection or any decreased infectiousness as a result of having a prior SARS-CoV-2 COVID to infection.

84
00:09:34,635 --> 00:09:39,164
So that's what we would have hoped, right? If I've already been infected, am I going to infect somebody else?

85
00:09:39,165 --> 00:09:42,765
Hopefully I'm less likely to infect somebody else because I've already been infected.

86
00:09:42,765 --> 00:09:51,494
We did not find that to be the case. Unfortunately, however, prior infection still remains protected on an individual basis.

87
00:09:51,495 --> 00:10:01,365
So if I am not infected but I had a prior infection, my contact with somebody else is less likely going to result in infection.

88
00:10:01,365 --> 00:10:08,775
So we still see protection on an individual basis, but from transmission we're not seeing any decreased severity or decreased infectiousness.

89
00:10:11,775 --> 00:10:19,305
So that's great overall, right? Mostly in these households, in this house, etc., I have a large, large number of adults.

90
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:23,275
So what about age? How to how do we kind of how does that play into it?

91
00:10:23,295 --> 00:10:30,435
So these are the results of the secondary attack risks stratified by age groups with

92
00:10:32,415 --> 00:10:37,545
infectious factors here on the top and then susceptibility here on the bottom.

93
00:10:37,995 --> 00:10:46,755
So looking here across the different age groups, they have young children, zero for children, 5 to 10 and adults in adolescence, 11 or older.

94
00:10:47,295 --> 00:10:51,405
And you see kind of a similar pattern for children in terms of infectiousness.

95
00:10:51,405 --> 00:10:54,554
It's basically the same no matter what's going on.

96
00:10:54,555 --> 00:10:58,575
So symptoms don't seem to make a difference in terms of infectiousness for children.

97
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:07,365
Prior infection doesn't seem to make a difference for infectiousness of children, but it does for for adults and adolescents.

98
00:11:07,405 --> 00:11:12,015
You see these widen this wide gap again, of likelihood of infection of.

99
00:11:14,655 --> 00:11:17,715
Symptomatic individuals compared to asymptomatic individuals.

100
00:11:17,725 --> 00:11:25,155
So you see these this this this large gap that that continues that we see in these large overall associations.

101
00:11:25,155 --> 00:11:29,025
But then when you hone in on to kids, that's not really what's going on. We see something different.

102
00:11:29,985 --> 00:11:38,114
And so you may say, oh, well, maybe is just a result of having lots of adults that are primary cases that are more symptomatic.

103
00:11:38,115 --> 00:11:42,315
That's that's driving this and you're capturing kids that are that are probably less infectious.

104
00:11:42,675 --> 00:11:48,345
So these statistical transmission models don't just rely on the first person to be infected.

105
00:11:48,585 --> 00:11:52,425
We're able to also look at the probability for infection for household members.

106
00:11:52,425 --> 00:11:59,955
So once a kid becomes positive for SARS-CoV-2, that plays into the probabilities and calculation.

107
00:11:59,955 --> 00:12:11,744
So when you are capturing these these children infections that traditionally in household studies are usually are usually missed for infectiousness,

108
00:12:11,745 --> 00:12:17,265
we still did not see an association with prior infection for adults or children.

109
00:12:17,265 --> 00:12:23,805
So that held true for the overall results and then for susceptibility that associate that

110
00:12:23,805 --> 00:12:28,094
positive association that we saw is mainly being driven by the adults in adolescence,

111
00:12:28,095 --> 00:12:32,565
whereas for young children in children there doesn't seem to really make a difference.

112
00:12:32,565 --> 00:12:36,374
So again, for kids, they're going to get at about the same rate,

113
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:44,115
kind of know regardless of what's going on, regardless of how many of prior infection at this point.

114
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:48,615
Um, so what about Comic-Con, right?

115
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:56,145
They scrape, you have lots of data from early on in the pandemic we're past that does on kind of come and put everything on its head.

116
00:12:57,125 --> 00:13:04,115
So these are about 37% of the cases of the households.

117
00:13:04,145 --> 00:13:14,775
So just around 100 houses are during the summer period, we did not see a difference in transmission based on age as as we previously did.

118
00:13:14,795 --> 00:13:20,735
So children were less infectious, broadly speaking, for Omnicom, that does not seem to be the case.

119
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:31,295
This may be a little bit of a power issue, given a large of fewer cases during this time period compared to the overall results.

120
00:13:31,295 --> 00:13:34,295
But it's something to pay attention to as we kind of move on.

121
00:13:34,565 --> 00:13:38,525
How are the transmission dynamics changing as the results of emerging variants?

122
00:13:39,695 --> 00:13:47,095
However, what is encouraging as we do see protection against prior against infection, given prior infection, even for our economy.

123
00:13:47,105 --> 00:13:48,514
So that's been a lot of concern, right,

124
00:13:48,515 --> 00:13:57,305
with vaccination right now is our cotton is breaking through the vaccines and the original strain vaccines that that we've been using.

125
00:13:57,785 --> 00:14:00,095
But what about prior infection? Already seen the same thing.

126
00:14:00,105 --> 00:14:05,995
So infection at any test with any time frame within the pandemic, whether it be, you know,

127
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:13,875
the original virus or more recent variants, it's still associated with protection against infection against our cotton.

128
00:14:13,925 --> 00:14:17,585
So that that is good news moving forward.

129
00:14:18,965 --> 00:14:26,765
So overall, an infection induced immunity is associated with protection against infection for adults, adolescents and children.

130
00:14:27,455 --> 00:14:35,075
Although children are less infectious, their infectiousness a similar kind of regardless of their symptoms, regardless of prior infection.

131
00:14:35,435 --> 00:14:42,664
And this suggests an age dependent immune response. Older individuals are likely developing broad immunity,

132
00:14:42,665 --> 00:14:51,575
while young children are not in immunologically naive and mounting responses to different parts potentially of the virus.

133
00:14:52,895 --> 00:14:56,255
So during this time, as this transition occurs to endemic city,

134
00:14:56,435 --> 00:15:00,215
young children are likely going to become more important to these transmission dynamics.

135
00:15:00,515 --> 00:15:06,905
And it's something that we need that we need to pay attention to. Moving forward, just some acknowledgments.

136
00:15:06,905 --> 00:15:12,175
Want to acknowledge Aubrey Gordon, my my mentor for supporting me through all this work,

137
00:15:12,185 --> 00:15:18,575
the entire team in Nicaragua that puts on this unspeakably amount of amazing work,

138
00:15:18,665 --> 00:15:24,125
honestly, to interact with all of the participants, collect all the samples without this,

139
00:15:24,725 --> 00:15:30,634
without all of that, this work, one of these won't be possible and then be shot.

140
00:15:30,635 --> 00:15:38,014
Well, for helping with the data side of things and then I've been of is a professor at the Ohio State University who

141
00:15:38,015 --> 00:15:44,405
developed these pairwise models and consulted with him on the implementation them the entire group as a whole.

142
00:15:45,635 --> 00:16:03,665
So that's what I think you. We want to take one question while we switched microphones.

143
00:16:05,415 --> 00:16:09,165
It was really interesting that the young kids act differently.

144
00:16:09,755 --> 00:16:18,195
You have blood samples collected from from then on. Are you thinking about looking at whether or not they were infected with common coronaviruses?

145
00:16:18,295 --> 00:16:24,035
Uh, uh, it's just that the, you know, maybe common coronavirus infection timing are good.

146
00:16:24,045 --> 00:16:25,694
Yeah. So it's going to resolve. Yeah.

147
00:16:25,695 --> 00:16:35,035
So one, one of the aims of my dissertation is we're looking at cross-protection for seasonal proto viruses, specifically in children.

148
00:16:35,055 --> 00:16:38,775
I know that opera is is planning more looks looking at that.

149
00:16:39,425 --> 00:16:46,095
I do think that there's probably a good likelihood that the seasonal coronavirus or at least,

150
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:49,465
you know, maybe immune imprinting related to that moderate.

151
00:16:49,515 --> 00:16:56,084
So a lot of the response to SARS-CoV-2 that there's been some really good work that showed that adults

152
00:16:56,085 --> 00:17:02,985
respond to variable regions of of the coronavirus when they when they are presented with infection,

153
00:17:02,985 --> 00:17:10,065
whether that be SARS-CoV-2 or the endemic viruses, whereas kids are responding to more structurally conserved regions of the virus.

154
00:17:11,355 --> 00:17:15,975
Now, the reason reason for that being, you know, kind of remains to be seen.

155
00:17:16,365 --> 00:17:21,525
And it is kind of a direction, I think lots of people, including opera, are trying to push things to look at.

156
00:17:23,555 --> 00:17:37,335
And. Okay.

157
00:17:37,455 --> 00:17:49,585
Perfect. Everyone.

158
00:17:49,915 --> 00:17:56,815
It's a real honor to be here. Thank you to the mysterious panelists that really show this this abstract.

159
00:17:57,265 --> 00:17:58,914
And there's also Emily's lovely regret,

160
00:17:58,915 --> 00:18:04,855
but it's a real honor to be able to talk about my work on the spectrum of influenza, including in Managua, Nicaragua.

161
00:18:05,095 --> 00:18:13,165
I was fortunate enough that Aaron went first because a lot of his studies, a lot of the data are drawing from drawn from the same same studies.

162
00:18:14,985 --> 00:18:20,485
Okay. So I want to start with a bit of background. Why children, why Nicaragua, why influenza?

163
00:18:21,325 --> 00:18:25,314
So really, though, this project does have some data on adults for comparison,

164
00:18:25,315 --> 00:18:28,825
our primary interest is what is the clinical presentation like in children?

165
00:18:29,185 --> 00:18:35,705
And the reason for that is multifactorial. We know that children are commonly infected with influenza an estimated 100

166
00:18:35,705 --> 00:18:40,494
million cases per year globally in children over the last several years extended.

167
00:18:40,495 --> 00:18:45,145
Of course, we know that those infections are not just a biologic phenomena.

168
00:18:45,145 --> 00:18:48,475
They also have socioeconomic impacts on children in their families.

169
00:18:49,715 --> 00:18:53,975
We know that children are the primary drivers of influenza transmission within a community.

170
00:18:54,555 --> 00:19:04,764
The mechanisms of that are still being sorted out. Children in general do relatively well with influenza, but they can get, of course, very sick.

171
00:19:04,765 --> 00:19:11,775
And the bulk of the burden of influenza in children is is not the primary infection, but rather post influenza sequelae.

172
00:19:12,055 --> 00:19:15,325
Things like secondary bacterial pneumonia is the quietest media.

173
00:19:15,895 --> 00:19:19,794
And that makes it difficult sometimes to quantify that exact burden in children,

174
00:19:19,795 --> 00:19:23,455
because often these things are taken out several weeks after the initial infection.

175
00:19:24,055 --> 00:19:32,485
On the other end of the spectrum, it's difficult to it has been difficult to quantify how common asymptomatic influenza is in children.

176
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:38,545
We know that adults between 20 to 40% of Adult England's infections are asymptomatic,

177
00:19:38,815 --> 00:19:43,405
but there's reason to believe that may look different in a child in a population of children.

178
00:19:45,615 --> 00:19:48,075
And then finally, mortality is a component of the story.

179
00:19:48,075 --> 00:19:56,955
Unfortunately, with 20 to 30000 deaths occurring from influenza annually in children, and the vast majority of these are in low income settings.

180
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:05,605
So really with all that in mind, there are two big questions I want to try and address today and that that this project is aimed at addressing.

181
00:20:05,965 --> 00:20:09,834
The first is the frequency of asymptomatic infections in children and whether there are

182
00:20:09,835 --> 00:20:15,505
associations between the symptoms a child has and whether they should virus detectable by PCR,

183
00:20:15,775 --> 00:20:19,015
which of course has implications for transmission dynamics.

184
00:20:19,225 --> 00:20:22,735
It seems like a simple question, but it's really something we don't have a good grasp of.

185
00:20:24,355 --> 00:20:32,155
And then secondly, we are interested in the full spectrum of medically attended influenza in a not necessarily hospitalized population.

186
00:20:32,455 --> 00:20:36,715
We have a lot of studies on how common these sequelae are in a hospitalized population.

187
00:20:36,955 --> 00:20:41,695
But of course, there's reason to believe that it would look different in the community due to differences in severity.

188
00:20:42,385 --> 00:20:49,255
And then also whether there are associations between the particular infecting strain and the risk of these sequelae occurring,

189
00:20:49,555 --> 00:20:55,495
which is a question that's been asked over and over in the literature. But there's no real consensus on whether there are important differences.

190
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:06,415
Okay. Moving into that package. So the data and presenting today are all drawing from several studies based in Managua, Nicaragua.

191
00:21:07,355 --> 00:21:09,934
Two of them are household B studies. So one of them, Aaron,

192
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:16,925
and really talked about these are household influenza transmission study or hits in the household influenza cohort study or six.

193
00:21:17,885 --> 00:21:23,704
And then one of them is a pediatric cohort that is primarily clinic based and is

194
00:21:23,705 --> 00:21:27,035
a prospective cohort called the Nicaraguan Pediatric Influenza Cohort Study.

195
00:21:27,425 --> 00:21:31,955
And I'm going to spend the next few slides describing some of the important details of these designs.

196
00:21:33,425 --> 00:21:35,075
And I loved Aaron's figure so much,

197
00:21:35,075 --> 00:21:45,035
I decided and thanks again to Hannah in the audience for for helping our lab out and communicating these studies, because they can be complicated.

198
00:21:45,755 --> 00:21:50,045
So this figure depicts both of the household studies. They are not the same exact design.

199
00:21:50,045 --> 00:21:53,915
It is a case ascertained study and X is a prospective cohort study.

200
00:21:54,095 --> 00:22:00,485
So some of the details differ. But the important point here is that when index cases are identified in either of these studies,

201
00:22:00,905 --> 00:22:07,954
the entire household from which that index case came undergoes intensive monitoring for influenza or COVID,

202
00:22:07,955 --> 00:22:13,595
as the case may be, and their samples are collected every 2 to 3 days.

203
00:22:13,805 --> 00:22:17,434
Respiratory samples that can be tested for influenza individuals,

204
00:22:17,435 --> 00:22:22,085
complete symptom diaries so that we know what sort of symptoms they have across the duration.

205
00:22:22,535 --> 00:22:27,575
And blood samples are collected at the initial activation, as well as 30 to 45 days after.

206
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:32,374
So the important point here is that many of these individuals enrolled in these household

207
00:22:32,375 --> 00:22:36,365
studies are being tested independently of the symptoms that they may or may not have.

208
00:22:36,875 --> 00:22:43,025
The index cases have symptoms by definition, but everyone else is being tested regardless of if they have a clinical presentation,

209
00:22:43,325 --> 00:22:47,075
which of course, is important if we're trying to understand asymptomatic influenza.

210
00:22:49,485 --> 00:22:53,835
The pediatric cohort. On the other hand, I should have mentioned the household studies had both children and adults.

211
00:22:54,195 --> 00:22:57,645
The pediatric cohort, as the name implies, is Children zero and 14.

212
00:22:58,425 --> 00:23:05,055
Much of the design features are similar in terms of the yearly data collection, but importantly children enrolled in the pediatric cohort.

213
00:23:05,055 --> 00:23:09,584
If they become ill, they are brought to the health center where they are only tested for influenza.

214
00:23:09,585 --> 00:23:15,665
If they meet certain symptom criteria, if they're tested, if they test positive, they have the normal standard of care,

215
00:23:16,095 --> 00:23:22,305
which often includes follow up medical visits in order to assess for complications of influenza.

216
00:23:22,545 --> 00:23:25,665
And we have very, very rich clinical data from this study,

217
00:23:25,965 --> 00:23:31,695
but obviously we're not ascertaining asymptomatic individuals because these kids have to be symptomatic to be tested.

218
00:23:32,465 --> 00:23:37,514
And so that's sort of the important difference. That is why we're using data from a lot of sources to answer these questions

219
00:23:37,515 --> 00:23:40,755
because they're sort of subtly different and what they allow us to address.

220
00:23:43,745 --> 00:23:45,365
The outcomes of interest.

221
00:23:45,575 --> 00:23:52,045
I've already alluded to a little bit, but I'm interested in the symptoms, clinical signs and sequelae associated with an influence infection.

222
00:23:53,195 --> 00:23:54,905
And these come from several sources.

223
00:23:54,905 --> 00:24:03,575
So individuals that visit the health center, they have a very robust, very robust, very standardized forms that are filled out by study physicians.

224
00:24:04,115 --> 00:24:09,665
So we have all this data that includes symptoms, signs, as well as any medical diagnoses associated with that visit.

225
00:24:10,625 --> 00:24:15,424
Individuals in the household studies have symptom diaries that are daily recollections of

226
00:24:15,425 --> 00:24:20,435
the symptoms and then add that 30 to 45 day follow up visit after the monitoring period.

227
00:24:20,795 --> 00:24:25,505
They are again asked what sort of symptoms they had over the course of of the monitoring period.

228
00:24:25,685 --> 00:24:30,245
So it's a relatively robust way of trying to make sure we're capturing any symptoms that are occurring.

229
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:34,265
And importantly, for the sake of this talk,

230
00:24:34,265 --> 00:24:43,775
I'm defining asymptomatic infection as the absence of fever and cough in no more than one other minor symptom, such as a sore throat or a runny nose.

231
00:24:44,315 --> 00:24:48,335
The reason for that is that children, if you ask any given child, those are your parents.

232
00:24:48,365 --> 00:24:53,975
If I were to ask you if your child had a runny nose in the last month that we're monitoring you, the answer is probably yes.

233
00:24:54,015 --> 00:24:58,875
And so we're trying to be a little bit more specific to symptoms that have an underlying pathogenesis.

234
00:24:58,895 --> 00:25:00,244
But with that being said,

235
00:25:00,245 --> 00:25:08,045
I will also present the results of a sensitivity analysis that uses the strictest possible definition of the complete absence of symptoms.

236
00:25:08,495 --> 00:25:15,805
But for now, this is the running definition. And I don't expect you to necessarily even be able to see all this.

237
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:20,675
But I put this slide up just to say that it's data from a lot of different sources, a lot of different studies.

238
00:25:20,965 --> 00:25:23,605
But overall, there are two populations are interested in.

239
00:25:23,815 --> 00:25:28,825
We have the household studies that we are using to answer questions on subclinical and asymptomatic flu.

240
00:25:29,005 --> 00:25:36,795
And we are using the pediatric cohort to answer questions about about the severity of medically attended influenza as well as the risk of supply.

241
00:25:37,345 --> 00:25:42,174
And in both of these sort of arms of the study were decently powered.

242
00:25:42,175 --> 00:25:49,375
We have we have you can see in the household studies with over a thousand infections, 1200 infections in children.

243
00:25:49,675 --> 00:25:53,365
And for the pediatric cohort, we have 2140 infections in children.

244
00:25:56,505 --> 00:26:00,825
For the analysis in order to answer questions about frequency.

245
00:26:01,125 --> 00:26:07,095
Unsurprisingly, we're using simple frequency analysis into how common asymptomatic clues across age groups,

246
00:26:07,335 --> 00:26:15,135
as well as how common these sequelae are in the community frequency analysis such as Chi Square, Fisher Exact and the Cochrane Heritage Test of trend.

247
00:26:16,235 --> 00:26:19,384
For our questions on the weather.

248
00:26:19,385 --> 00:26:24,244
The risk of these influenza sequelae differ by infecting strain are usually generalized.

249
00:26:24,245 --> 00:26:29,135
When you mix models with categorical age adjustment, that is so that we can account for repeated measures.

250
00:26:29,645 --> 00:26:33,395
If the same child has multiple infections across the illustration.

251
00:26:35,835 --> 00:26:36,165
Okay.

252
00:26:36,405 --> 00:26:43,195
We think they knew the results when I first talked about the results pertaining to the asymptomatic influenza derived from the household studies.

253
00:26:44,575 --> 00:26:49,525
So this figure represents the fraction of infections that are asymptomatic.

254
00:26:50,395 --> 00:26:55,345
Both panels, the x axis is h categories. The y axis is the proportion who are asymptomatic.

255
00:26:55,705 --> 00:26:59,034
I will note it's actually kind of poorly, poorly done.

256
00:26:59,035 --> 00:27:02,215
The panel on the left is 50 plus years. That includes adults as well.

257
00:27:02,225 --> 00:27:13,525
That's not just older adolescents. What we see is that can get to the the children ages 214 were very unlikely to be asymptomatic.

258
00:27:13,705 --> 00:27:21,534
6.6% of those infections are asymptomatic compared to 26.6% of older adolescents and adults on the right.

259
00:27:21,535 --> 00:27:25,914
I further stratified the children just to show that there's a clear age trend where the youngest

260
00:27:25,915 --> 00:27:30,865
children are the least likely to be asymptomatic and older children are more likely to be symptomatic.

261
00:27:33,285 --> 00:27:36,075
This figure represents the exact same data as the last one.

262
00:27:36,075 --> 00:27:42,945
I just also stratified the adults to show that while there is this clear age trend in young children below age 14,

263
00:27:43,245 --> 00:27:49,395
there is no age trend in older adolescents and adults. And I think there are several explanations for this.

264
00:27:49,395 --> 00:27:56,835
I think we know that children are biologically different. They are they have smaller airways, less ability to clear their airways than adults do.

265
00:27:57,315 --> 00:28:03,975
And so it may be that an infection of the same sort of circumstance may be more likely to be symptomatic in young children for those reasons.

266
00:28:04,455 --> 00:28:10,485
We also know that children are immunologically naive. They don't have the exposure history that older adolescents and adults would.

267
00:28:10,725 --> 00:28:18,735
So that may play a role here as well, although it's unlikely just the binary first infection versus not given the actual age here.

268
00:28:19,095 --> 00:28:25,875
And we've also discussed whether there are other explanations. Age 15 is kind of a weird threshold to transition from, you know,

269
00:28:25,875 --> 00:28:32,115
from from gaining this protection against symptomatic infection to do not is age further increases.

270
00:28:32,325 --> 00:28:36,885
It's possible that social factors such as you know, the onset of adolescence,

271
00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:41,385
your ability to communicate with the physician, those sorts of things can also come into play here as well.

272
00:28:44,465 --> 00:28:49,834
Shifting gears a little bit, this figure represents the proportion of infections that exhibited viral shedding,

273
00:28:49,835 --> 00:28:57,095
detectable by PCR, and it's also stratified by asymptomatic in the sort of red color in symptomatic is the greatest clue.

274
00:28:57,725 --> 00:29:06,845
And what we see is that both adults and children here on the left, if they are asymptomatic, they are relatively likely Irish, detectable by PCR.

275
00:29:07,115 --> 00:29:12,485
But even if they're asymptomatic, about 40 to 50% of these infections are still shedding virus.

276
00:29:13,235 --> 00:29:18,605
If you look on the right, we see that individuals so this is this is children for the stratify.

277
00:29:18,905 --> 00:29:23,165
What we see is that the youngest children, though they are the least likely to be asymptomatic.

278
00:29:23,465 --> 00:29:26,975
They're the most likely to still spread virus if they are asymptomatic.

279
00:29:27,545 --> 00:29:32,465
And that trend is also significant for kids in junior 14, but not so in adults.

280
00:29:34,125 --> 00:29:36,434
And again, viral shedding is not synonymous with transmission,

281
00:29:36,435 --> 00:29:41,985
but this certainly implies that there may be some dynamics at play in terms of in terms of young kids,

282
00:29:41,985 --> 00:29:45,915
especially propensity to to transmit infection if asymptomatic.

283
00:29:48,545 --> 00:29:51,325
As promised earlier, I know you were waiting in anticipation.

284
00:29:51,515 --> 00:29:57,575
Here's a sensitivity analysis where I've defined asymptomatic infections, the complete absence of symptoms.

285
00:29:57,995 --> 00:30:02,315
And as you would expect with the stricter definition, the overall proportions are lower.

286
00:30:02,975 --> 00:30:08,675
But all the trends are still holding. We see that it's 5.4% of young kids as opposed to 6.6%.

287
00:30:09,395 --> 00:30:12,155
But the trend in the youngest kids still holds for the youngest.

288
00:30:12,155 --> 00:30:18,185
Kids are the least likely to be asymptomatic in the absence of a trend still holds in older adults.

289
00:30:21,025 --> 00:30:23,425
Okay. The next president drills, I promise this one is shorter.

290
00:30:23,435 --> 00:30:30,265
But I want to briefly talk about the clinical presentation in this medically attended group from the pediatric cohort.

291
00:30:32,515 --> 00:30:39,745
So this figure represents the frequency of these posts influenza sequelae in confirmed PCR infections.

292
00:30:39,985 --> 00:30:44,215
I mean, again, these are kids who are seeking care who meet certain symptom criteria to be tested.

293
00:30:44,965 --> 00:30:48,405
What we see, first of all, is that these are all relatively rare.

294
00:30:49,015 --> 00:30:53,424
The most common of which was acute has to be at a little over 3%, followed by pneumonia,

295
00:30:53,425 --> 00:30:58,975
followed by hospitalization, such as sinusitis and probable seizures for very rare.

296
00:30:59,155 --> 00:31:06,445
And fortunately we were underpowered to detect more severe sequelae such as encephalitis or something like this.

297
00:31:09,175 --> 00:31:17,655
And finally, this figure represents the odds ratios of of these certain sequelae as a function of the virus strain.

298
00:31:17,665 --> 00:31:21,805
So type subtype and lineage on the top middle and dogs of corresponding group.

299
00:31:22,285 --> 00:31:25,705
There were no differences in the odds of sequelae I These are aged just as well.

300
00:31:25,705 --> 00:31:29,095
There's no difference in the odds of quality for influenza A versus B.

301
00:31:29,485 --> 00:31:35,575
However, for H1N1 pandemic strain, we see higher highs of hospitalization and acute today's media risk.

302
00:31:35,575 --> 00:31:41,995
For for Victorian Yamagata, we see higher odds of pneumonia for Victoria when compared to Yamagata.

303
00:31:42,535 --> 00:31:47,184
The point isn't on that, but it was 10.99, so a relatively large amount of uncertainty,

304
00:31:47,185 --> 00:31:51,685
but at least from a point estimate standpoint, a relatively large increased risk.

305
00:31:52,195 --> 00:31:57,345
I will say this last one is especially interesting given the seemingly global absence of flu.

306
00:31:57,425 --> 00:32:04,795
They've got it since the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. If we see a higher proportion of flu cases due to young occurred due to Victoria in the future,

307
00:32:05,005 --> 00:32:08,995
we may see proportionally more pneumonia in children than we are used to.

308
00:32:09,405 --> 00:32:16,465
I will also, after making that broad statement, I will say I'm a firm believer that these sort of analyzes are incredibly context dependent,

309
00:32:17,125 --> 00:32:24,865
especially dependent on the exposure, history and sort of endemic history of influenza and whatever community you're looking at.

310
00:32:25,135 --> 00:32:29,274
And so part of the story here is also probably one of original antigenic said,

311
00:32:29,275 --> 00:32:33,115
one of how these kids have developed, how they've grown and what they've been exposed to.

312
00:32:33,355 --> 00:32:36,895
And that's something that's really difficult to account for in this sort of analysis.

313
00:32:39,095 --> 00:32:45,275
Okay. So finally, I know there was a lot of a lot of points to this on to leave you with a few big picture conclusions to take away.

314
00:32:46,595 --> 00:32:54,365
One is that asymptomatic flu is rare and it's age dependent and children with the youngest children being the least likely to be asymptomatic.

315
00:32:55,295 --> 00:33:02,735
Asymptomatic individuals, both adults and children, are less likely to shed virus in asymptomatic individuals, but it's not zero.

316
00:33:02,745 --> 00:33:04,385
About half of those infections still do.

317
00:33:05,885 --> 00:33:11,764
This is clear, very rare in the community setting and perhaps more rare than many of our commonly accepted estimates.

318
00:33:11,765 --> 00:33:14,945
Or part of that is that this is not a hospitalized population.

319
00:33:15,095 --> 00:33:19,415
This is probably more representative of your general sort of outpatient setting.

320
00:33:20,135 --> 00:33:23,975
And then finally, virus strain may be important in terms of the risk of these sequelae,

321
00:33:24,305 --> 00:33:31,855
but but equally important is sort of the immune context that I think studying the interplay of these things is certainly something I'm interested in,

322
00:33:31,865 --> 00:33:35,345
but we don't have data on yet. So with that, I will close.

323
00:33:35,675 --> 00:33:41,705
I don't know if I I guess it's important to think people first of all, regarding my wonderful advisor,

324
00:33:41,705 --> 00:33:47,284
as well as other members of the court and group members of our Nicolaides study in this area so eloquently

325
00:33:47,285 --> 00:33:53,995
said none of these data would be possible without without these these wonderful individuals and of course,

326
00:33:54,005 --> 00:33:57,725
our funders as well. I don't know if I left time for questions,

327
00:33:57,725 --> 00:34:04,025
but I feel free to reach out on social media or email if you have questions that are unanswered after this session.

328
00:34:04,355 --> 00:34:08,705
And with that, thanks again to the organizers. And questions are now.

329
00:34:08,705 --> 00:34:11,915
No, go ahead. Take one while we kind of move and then we will.

330
00:34:17,355 --> 00:34:24,895
A quick question for you about the rates of asymptomatic disease by age.

331
00:34:26,305 --> 00:34:36,565
Could you comment on the kind of data collection methodology inasmuch that a three year old won't report symptoms?

332
00:34:37,025 --> 00:34:40,375
They are observed symptoms by presumably parents,

333
00:34:40,735 --> 00:34:50,284
whereas a 15 year old and you pick the 15 year olds is the kind of cutoff they have a greater propensity to self-report symptoms.

334
00:34:50,285 --> 00:34:54,295
So is that interfering with the data? That's a great question.

335
00:34:54,295 --> 00:34:58,075
And you're exactly right that in certain symptoms, we don't even collect in younger kids,

336
00:34:58,075 --> 00:35:02,905
because if I ask a one year old if they have a headache, they sort of look at me and go, right.

337
00:35:04,705 --> 00:35:10,255
It actually probably would. But I agree that probably the results are slightly biased due to that.

338
00:35:10,795 --> 00:35:15,655
I think they're biased in a direction that it would actually be it would reinforce these findings.

339
00:35:15,865 --> 00:35:24,115
If we had a lot of kids who were symptomatic, who were 0 to 1 year old or 1 to 2 year old that weren't able to communicate that that actually would

340
00:35:24,505 --> 00:35:30,295
further inflate the number of symptomatic cases and further deflate the number of asymptomatic infections.

341
00:35:31,195 --> 00:35:36,135
And so I think those trends would actually be even stronger. If that makes sense.

342
00:35:36,615 --> 00:35:41,865
Yeah. Yeah, I think it makes sense if you don't think it would be.

343
00:35:42,495 --> 00:35:46,365
The counterfactual might be the parents kind of imagine.

344
00:35:47,305 --> 00:35:53,655
That's that's a good point. Yeah. So in that scenario, if, you know, if parents are more likely to report, I will say that.

345
00:35:53,835 --> 00:35:57,765
For for symptoms that we know are going to be unreliable, something like a headache,

346
00:35:57,765 --> 00:36:04,575
something like a a stomach ache, anything that doesn't have some flavor of objectivity.

347
00:36:04,755 --> 00:36:06,405
We're not even included in that.

348
00:36:06,405 --> 00:36:13,035
The younger children in the analysis of the younger children, because we think that even if there are data there, it's probably not reliable.

349
00:36:13,305 --> 00:36:16,485
So I think we avoid that a little bit, but it certainly is a concern.

350
00:36:16,485 --> 00:36:20,325
I mean, symptoms by definition are subjective, so it's difficult.

351
00:36:21,045 --> 00:36:27,645
There is no gold standard. And so how that shifts by age, how that shifts at certain thresholds like adolescence, I mentioned,

352
00:36:27,645 --> 00:36:32,565
I think is is important, but it's something that it's a little bit difficult to tease out.

353
00:36:34,265 --> 00:36:39,935
Great question. Thank you for your time, sir.

354
00:36:41,645 --> 00:36:48,585
I hope people get here. Sorry. This is of.

355
00:37:01,255 --> 00:37:10,765
And then. I agree. Erin Hannah finishes up, make your way to the table so that you can answer a couple more questions.

356
00:37:11,435 --> 00:37:16,485
Right. Hi, everyone. Experiencing food, confusion.

357
00:37:17,635 --> 00:37:22,194
So I'm going to talk about some of the work we've been doing on how change in

358
00:37:22,195 --> 00:37:28,645
particular temperature changes are impacting bigger and bigger risk in Brazil.

359
00:37:28,925 --> 00:37:34,195
And we are using a temperature dependent basic reproduction number to investigate this, which I will explain.

360
00:37:36,485 --> 00:37:43,625
So quick background knowledge. They're both arboviruses and they're transmitted by the mosquito.

361
00:37:44,405 --> 00:37:49,745
Huge burden of disease. Globally, they infect around 100 to 400 million people.

362
00:37:50,765 --> 00:37:55,805
They're pretty common throughout Latin America, South Asia and parts of Africa as well.

363
00:37:57,875 --> 00:38:01,505
So oftentimes we want to measure how infectious these viruses are.

364
00:38:02,315 --> 00:38:06,275
And one great way to do that is the basic reproduction number or not.

365
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:10,085
And it's basically measuring epidemic potential.

366
00:38:10,415 --> 00:38:18,005
So basically, it's trying to determine the number of secondary infections expected from a single infection.

367
00:38:18,005 --> 00:38:22,085
And then the assumption under here is that it's a fully susceptible population,

368
00:38:22,655 --> 00:38:28,114
which means that the number might seem high sometimes to some people because like normally

369
00:38:28,115 --> 00:38:32,465
there's some prior immunity going on either through natural infection or vaccination.

370
00:38:34,115 --> 00:38:39,965
So one of the reasons we're interested in Zika and danger in general is because if you look at this graph,

371
00:38:39,965 --> 00:38:43,715
you can see that they peak at relatively high temperatures.

372
00:38:43,715 --> 00:38:49,684
And what that means is that basically this graph is showing the relative or not

373
00:38:49,685 --> 00:38:55,385
or the the risk for a bunch of different viruses across different temperatures.

374
00:38:55,865 --> 00:39:03,275
And so most of the viruses, you can see their risk peaks at around like 20 to 26 degrees Celsius.

375
00:39:03,785 --> 00:39:13,955
But then on the right in like sort of colors, you go and then they are kind of outliers in that they're peaking at around 30 to 31 degrees Celsius.

376
00:39:15,035 --> 00:39:21,695
So obviously, this is kind of concerning because, you know, if on average the globe is heating up and getting warmer,

377
00:39:22,685 --> 00:39:31,505
the frame of reference sort of might shift to the right and these diseases might become more sort of able to spread in different climates.

378
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:37,355
So there's a like I was just saying, climate change is one factor.

379
00:39:37,775 --> 00:39:43,415
But then the other factor is some countries like Brazil have had previous Zika outbreaks.

380
00:39:43,985 --> 00:39:53,045
So we know that they're suitable for transmission currently, but we sort of want to look into how that's going to change in the coming years.

381
00:39:53,585 --> 00:40:00,905
So we're focusing on Brazil here, particularly because they were hit pretty bad with Zika in 2015 to 2016.

382
00:40:01,835 --> 00:40:06,605
However, Brazil is a really large country and there's a lot of spatial heterogeneity.

383
00:40:07,055 --> 00:40:08,945
There's a lot of different climates throughout the country.

384
00:40:09,755 --> 00:40:17,255
So as you can see in this graph on the left, the country tends to be a little bit warmer the further north in the Amazonian region,

385
00:40:17,255 --> 00:40:19,385
and then it's a little cooler to the south.

386
00:40:21,125 --> 00:40:26,405
And then on top of that, we're not actually sure like how climate change is going to influence temperatures.

387
00:40:27,155 --> 00:40:30,635
There's different estimations based on different scenarios.

388
00:40:30,725 --> 00:40:34,744
So this graph right here on the right is showing different RCP scenarios.

389
00:40:34,745 --> 00:40:37,865
RCP stands for representative concentration pathway.

390
00:40:38,915 --> 00:40:46,145
Basically, a bunch of climate scientists got together and came up with these four possible scenarios for how severe climate change could be.

391
00:40:46,685 --> 00:40:55,265
And the worst case scenario is RCP 8.5 corresponding to the red line, and that's about four degrees warming by the year 2100.

392
00:40:55,895 --> 00:41:02,735
And then the best case scenario, which requires really severe mitigation efforts on a global scale,

393
00:41:03,305 --> 00:41:07,025
is RCP 2.6, and that corresponds to about one degree of warming.

394
00:41:07,145 --> 00:41:12,515
So not only do we have we're kind of investigating this from a large spatial area,

395
00:41:12,935 --> 00:41:17,405
but we're also trying to sort of look at a bunch of different climate change scenarios and what could happen there.

396
00:41:18,305 --> 00:41:20,735
So that brings us to the research question,

397
00:41:20,735 --> 00:41:30,395
which is primarily we want to look at how temperature changes specifically driven by climate change can impact Zika risk in Brazil.

398
00:41:30,785 --> 00:41:36,184
And then we're going to be looking about 30 years into the future because we didn't want to look too soon,

399
00:41:36,185 --> 00:41:40,325
because you might not expect that much changes in the next five or ten years.

400
00:41:40,775 --> 00:41:45,665
And you don't want to point out because there's more uncertainty out towards like 2100 in these models.

401
00:41:47,825 --> 00:41:56,375
So then back to this idea of heterogeneity, we want to look both like around how the risk looks and then year to year how the risk changes.

402
00:41:56,795 --> 00:42:03,935
And then we also want to look again over that sort of like spatial area, different climatic regions in Brazil.

403
00:42:04,385 --> 00:42:09,235
And then as promised in the title, we're also going to be looking at dengue.

404
00:42:09,725 --> 00:42:12,725
This is primarily to contextualize our results for Zika.

405
00:42:13,415 --> 00:42:17,015
Dinghy is a lot more prevalent worldwide and so we know a lot more about it.

406
00:42:17,015 --> 00:42:23,325
So it's good to have that sort of for comparison. So I'm going to walk through the methods really quickly.

407
00:42:24,915 --> 00:42:30,945
So we have a temperature dependent or not equation and it has a lot of different parameters in it.

408
00:42:31,185 --> 00:42:36,885
Most of them are related to sort of like the biology of the mosquito and they're empirically informed.

409
00:42:37,905 --> 00:42:44,714
So for example, we have the baiting rate, which is a and then we have the adult mosquito mortality rate,

410
00:42:44,715 --> 00:42:48,165
the virus extrinsic incubation rate, and then vector competence.

411
00:42:48,675 --> 00:42:52,755
And then these graphs on the right are just showing what the distribution looks like over temperature.

412
00:42:53,445 --> 00:42:56,535
And as you can see, particularly for vector competence,

413
00:42:57,285 --> 00:43:03,605
dengue on average has much higher vector competence and it is a aegypti mosquito than Zika does.

414
00:43:04,095 --> 00:43:05,325
So that's going to sorry,

415
00:43:06,045 --> 00:43:12,285
that's going to kind of drive like some of the differences we're seeing between these two viruses in the results section, which is coming.

416
00:43:13,815 --> 00:43:19,755
And then we also have temperature independent parameters, which are going to be constants here.

417
00:43:20,085 --> 00:43:27,015
So we have the human birth and death rate, human latency rate, human recovery rate, and then the ratio of mosquitoes to humans on the right.

418
00:43:28,765 --> 00:43:33,475
So as promised, we wanted to look at a different set of climates.

419
00:43:34,435 --> 00:43:42,085
So we're looking here at four cities in particular, sort of representative of the heart of the Amazon is Manaus,

420
00:43:42,625 --> 00:43:46,885
which is according to the global climate classification. It's a monsoon climate.

421
00:43:46,895 --> 00:43:55,045
It's very warm and very humid. And then we have his CV, which is a coastal city in a kind of a tropical savanna climate.

422
00:43:55,555 --> 00:44:00,595
Still pretty warm, but not as cool as the last two cities, which are Rio de Janeiro,

423
00:44:01,585 --> 00:44:06,175
which is sort of straddling different climates, but it's mostly a warm oceanic climate.

424
00:44:06,745 --> 00:44:11,805
And then Sao Paulo is going to be the coolest of all of the cities on average. And it's a subtropical climate.

425
00:44:13,845 --> 00:44:19,815
So the first thing we did is we expected five years of temperature data, historical temperature data.

426
00:44:19,905 --> 00:44:24,465
So that's years 2015 to 2019 for each of the four cities.

427
00:44:24,735 --> 00:44:31,335
And then this last panel here is just the five year averages of the.

428
00:44:32,315 --> 00:44:34,505
Of the temperatures across the five years in the forties.

429
00:44:36,675 --> 00:44:47,715
And then the next thing we did in order to make the projection, we got what the temperature is expected to be by that 30 year projection.

430
00:44:48,075 --> 00:44:54,375
So for the year 2045 to 2049, and we think Cuba explains just to sort of smooth out.

431
00:44:54,885 --> 00:45:01,065
You saw on the previous slide is a bunch of dots that we wanted to see that I would keep explains and note that

432
00:45:01,065 --> 00:45:08,625
there's four lines so like the RCP it's it just got updated to SSP which is shared socioeconomic pathways.

433
00:45:08,635 --> 00:45:15,555
So SSP 126 is sort of the best case scenario like in terms of climate change mitigation.

434
00:45:15,795 --> 00:45:21,855
And then SSP 585 is the worst case scenario and then this is averaged over the five years.

435
00:45:22,125 --> 00:45:25,815
That's why there's only one year shown on the x axis.

436
00:45:26,535 --> 00:45:32,175
So as you can see, the cities are not expected to be impacted uniformly by climate change.

437
00:45:32,535 --> 00:45:36,225
And also in particular, it looks like in the worst case scenario might even.

438
00:45:37,955 --> 00:45:41,555
Be a couple of degrees warmer, particularly at the end of the year.

439
00:45:43,835 --> 00:45:45,935
So I'm going to move on to the results.

440
00:45:46,745 --> 00:45:51,965
So the first thing we did is we just plug the temperature into the equation to see what the distribution looks like.

441
00:45:52,535 --> 00:45:59,095
And we thought like doing it on average is a much higher risk than because.

442
00:45:59,585 --> 00:46:05,375
Oh, and I want to highlight real quick that dotted line across the one that's

443
00:46:05,405 --> 00:46:08,765
there's like an importance of whether or not is greater than or less than one.

444
00:46:09,275 --> 00:46:15,725
Greater than one means that we would expect an outbreak or transmission to, you know, continue to happen.

445
00:46:16,115 --> 00:46:21,725
And then less than one means you might expect it to die out. So that's why I've indicated that on the graph.

446
00:46:22,625 --> 00:46:28,795
So they both peak at around 30 degrees Celsius, although dengue is way more infectious than Zika is.

447
00:46:29,935 --> 00:46:36,295
And this is pretty consistent with existing research. I think generally scientists agree that dengue is more infectious than Zika.

448
00:46:38,065 --> 00:46:41,575
So this is now we're actually plugging in not just the temperature,

449
00:46:41,575 --> 00:46:45,375
but we're putting in actual temperatures for these four cities to get these results.

450
00:46:45,385 --> 00:46:53,815
So the top row is Zika and the bottom is dengue. And basically sort of as one might expect,

451
00:46:54,025 --> 00:47:01,435
there's like a there's an increase in risk throughout the different scenarios and like not uniform throughout the year.

452
00:47:03,315 --> 00:47:10,665
So I wanted to highlight a couple of things in these results. The first one is potential for extended risk season.

453
00:47:11,745 --> 00:47:16,695
So things like runoffs. There are Earnhardt is pretty much always above one.

454
00:47:17,205 --> 00:47:24,135
So that's kind of year round risk. But if you look at ACP and Rio, they are not always suitable for transmission.

455
00:47:24,915 --> 00:47:29,925
In particular, the beginning of the year, consistent with the 2015 to 2016 outbreak,

456
00:47:30,105 --> 00:47:35,115
is when risk is greater than one or the answer is greater than one.

457
00:47:35,505 --> 00:47:42,975
So you can sort of see that the percentage of the year that these middle two cities spend above one is increasing.

458
00:47:43,365 --> 00:47:49,605
It doesn't look like much, but it is actually better a couple of months. So that's the first thing that we've noticed in our results.

459
00:47:50,805 --> 00:47:57,975
And then basically we took this last scrap I just showed and we split it out year by year

460
00:47:58,395 --> 00:48:04,155
to sort of show how there's a lot of heterogeneity between the different eras as expected.

461
00:48:05,685 --> 00:48:12,075
So this slide is sort of highlighting the year to year variation of seasonal epidemic potential.

462
00:48:13,095 --> 00:48:18,495
Some of the cities, more than others, like minus the each column looks completely different,

463
00:48:19,095 --> 00:48:30,945
seems like usually pretty consistent with the temperature. So the other thing we noticed is I think something that a lot of scientists and infectious

464
00:48:30,945 --> 00:48:35,805
disease epidemiologists are interested in is is climate change going to reduce risk?

465
00:48:36,525 --> 00:48:43,184
And we actually didn't really find evidence of this only in extremely severe, really,

466
00:48:43,185 --> 00:48:47,505
really hot climates under really hot or really high climate change scenarios.

467
00:48:48,015 --> 00:48:58,455
So minus in the year 2045 and 2049, you can see that there's a pretty notable decrease in risk in the month of October,

468
00:48:59,505 --> 00:49:06,795
but that's only in the worst case climate change scenario. So SSP 585 and it's also not for the entire year, right?

469
00:49:07,395 --> 00:49:10,125
So you can still see like January through July,

470
00:49:10,365 --> 00:49:17,535
the risk is still significantly higher than it was for the historical baseline window, which again was 2015 to 2019.

471
00:49:18,615 --> 00:49:25,005
So it's not like any sort of massive decrease in risk when you're around around the world or anything like that.

472
00:49:26,605 --> 00:49:32,545
And then again highlighting the heterogeneity year to year and between SSP scenarios.

473
00:49:33,565 --> 00:49:38,845
So I think this was most noticeable for our coolest two cities.

474
00:49:38,935 --> 00:49:50,695
So we have Rio and Sao Paulo and you can sort of see both like the lines are really distinct in that depending on which SSP scenario actually happens,

475
00:49:50,935 --> 00:49:55,855
our model is showing drastically different risk and then also year to year.

476
00:49:57,645 --> 00:50:02,955
The results are really different, especially one of the highlights of Apollo in the year 2049,

477
00:50:03,475 --> 00:50:11,415
65, 85 is now shifting it into a much more likely four figure transmission suitability.

478
00:50:12,465 --> 00:50:16,125
So that's that's one thing that's sort of interesting about the results.

479
00:50:17,085 --> 00:50:27,465
So to conclude, our model did show inevitable increase in risk by the 30 for the 30 year projections by 2045 to 2049.

480
00:50:27,915 --> 00:50:30,975
And this is true in four of the most mitigated climate change scenarios.

481
00:50:30,975 --> 00:50:37,815
So P 126 Even that climate change scenario is still showing some degree of increase in risk.

482
00:50:38,385 --> 00:50:44,565
And then I think the final sort of implication of this work is national level

483
00:50:44,565 --> 00:50:51,494
preparation should probably be more prepared for both extended risk seasons,

484
00:50:51,495 --> 00:50:55,425
especially as we saw in Rio and then earlier risk seasons.

485
00:50:56,565 --> 00:51:01,964
Some cities currently are the risk season is sort of like in the earlier months of

486
00:51:01,965 --> 00:51:05,355
the year and we saw that it was sort of shifting maybe closer to like October.

487
00:51:06,825 --> 00:51:10,835
So, yeah, that's that's the main takeaway. Thank you so much for your time.

488
00:51:19,045 --> 00:51:27,014
She professional, everybody get settled. A question.

489
00:51:27,015 --> 00:51:34,725
So you're are not I mean, typically it's done with cases, not infections, but obviously tendency and gay and Zika have a lot in a parent infection.

490
00:51:34,725 --> 00:51:44,615
So you were looking kind of looking at cases, right? So, you know, so higher temperature does lead to higher knots.

491
00:51:44,625 --> 00:51:50,024
But, you know, at least for there's it's kind of been postulated that for some diseases like chicken go near,

492
00:51:50,025 --> 00:51:56,354
for instance, that it may have to do not with as much of impacting infection rates,

493
00:51:56,355 --> 00:52:00,135
although it does because it impacts the replication of mosquito gut,

494
00:52:00,135 --> 00:52:07,665
but also impacts the in a parent to the apparent ratio so that the the amount of infections that are clinically apparent.

495
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:10,934
Did you take that into account in the models?

496
00:52:10,935 --> 00:52:15,915
I'm not sure how you would, but are how are you thinking about how temperature change would impact the organs?

497
00:52:16,545 --> 00:52:24,645
Yeah. So we're not taking into account like the in a parent versus the parent infections in our model currently.

498
00:52:24,885 --> 00:52:29,355
So if that is impacting like the previous presentations in the same way,

499
00:52:30,315 --> 00:52:37,664
how likely you are to transmit or the viral load then that that's not taking into consideration in our results.

500
00:52:37,665 --> 00:52:41,895
It's mostly based on like the mosquito biology, the parameter ization of the model.

501
00:52:44,115 --> 00:52:46,315
Yeah. So when you when the are not goes up. Right.

502
00:52:46,335 --> 00:52:52,405
That the, the average like the infection risk goes up, then the average age of first infection decreases.

503
00:52:52,665 --> 00:52:55,755
Like I guess this is my question so.

504
00:52:57,395 --> 00:53:03,094
So for Zika, which I believe we all still believe, you can only get infected once in life.

505
00:53:03,095 --> 00:53:08,015
And children are highly symptomatic, although not quite as systematic as we thought.

506
00:53:08,075 --> 00:53:12,485
If you look closely, have you kind of have you thought about that?

507
00:53:12,515 --> 00:53:22,834
It feels like you're like maybe these these models are a little bit not taking into account the kind of underlying biology and epidemiological trends,

508
00:53:22,835 --> 00:53:27,545
right? Because if your infection risk goes way up, everybody's going to then get it as a young child.

509
00:53:27,875 --> 00:53:30,934
And then you've got a very high rate of like asymptomatic.

510
00:53:30,935 --> 00:53:36,155
So then you shouldn't actually see these are not increasing it or not as much of your counting cases.

511
00:53:36,455 --> 00:53:41,045
Yeah. So the are not we're assuming a fully susceptible population.

512
00:53:41,345 --> 00:53:43,175
It's a measurement of epidemic potential.

513
00:53:43,445 --> 00:53:50,344
And so immune effects would be something like totally like a totally different thing to take into consideration.

514
00:53:50,345 --> 00:53:54,935
And then the other thing is it's currently not really endemic in a lot of areas.

515
00:53:54,935 --> 00:54:03,905
And so we can sort of expect like immune effects, like maybe to be less of a consideration than it would be for other arboviruses, such as dengue.

516
00:54:04,955 --> 00:54:11,945
But yeah, we're sort of just solely focused on the epidemic potential here, and we're not actually completely 100% susceptible.

517
00:54:12,065 --> 00:54:16,924
So if you thought about like kind of going more into real world application by then,

518
00:54:16,925 --> 00:54:20,915
trying to modeling what would be happening with the populations as well.

519
00:54:21,665 --> 00:54:24,875
Yeah, I think I think that's kind of what I was originally doing,

520
00:54:25,655 --> 00:54:31,335
but I kind of was talking to my advisors and we switched it to are not like the very purpose of like

521
00:54:31,355 --> 00:54:36,935
just how complex like the immunity is and like how you don't really know much about figure immunity.

522
00:54:37,745 --> 00:54:41,045
But yeah, that would be really cool to look at for sure.

523
00:54:43,095 --> 00:54:51,595
You can go ahead and have a seat at the table. And I have a question for you.

524
00:54:51,795 --> 00:54:57,885
I'm going to take other people's questions first. So those were really great presentations.

525
00:54:57,895 --> 00:55:05,145
Thank you. And the Nicaragua cohort. I'll start with a flu question and then if there's time, I'll ask a Kovic question.

526
00:55:06,015 --> 00:55:15,825
You know, you may be familiar. Cheryl Cohen in South Africa has prospective cohorts and she sees much more asymptomatic flu in children.

527
00:55:15,825 --> 00:55:22,395
And it may be a factor of your definition. And you did define that, which is great.

528
00:55:22,425 --> 00:55:27,585
You said this is the way we're defining asymptomatic. So I'm going to ask you another definition question.

529
00:55:28,125 --> 00:55:37,035
How did you define shedding virus and how did you differentiate that from infection?

530
00:55:37,625 --> 00:55:43,094
Yeah, great question. Given another minute to present evidence that we had it out ahead of time,

531
00:55:43,095 --> 00:55:47,255
but for the household over which we also did, hemagglutinin patient division has.

532
00:55:47,985 --> 00:55:57,794
And so essentially the individuals who were infected but did not shed virus were those who were positive for HIV, but not for PCR and PCR.

533
00:55:57,795 --> 00:56:00,914
Serially, every 2 to 3 days we have samples.

534
00:56:00,915 --> 00:56:05,625
We ran PCR up to five times across intensive monitoring period for each individual.

535
00:56:05,865 --> 00:56:11,415
If they showed a seroconversion on a high but never popped a positive on those samples.

536
00:56:11,625 --> 00:56:17,685
That's what we consider to be infected, but not shedding. So shedding is viral detection.

537
00:56:18,135 --> 00:56:21,375
That is qualitative. A yes or no? Correct? Yes.

538
00:56:21,855 --> 00:56:27,825
Okay. Thank you. Yeah. I would love to get into a more quantitative amount of shedding and stuff like that.

539
00:56:28,005 --> 00:56:34,365
It was a little bit beyond the scope of this project, but I certainly think there is this is sort of scratching the surface of of,

540
00:56:34,665 --> 00:56:40,605
you know, whether there are, you know, quantitative differences as well and in the amount how that may correspond to transmission.

541
00:56:40,815 --> 00:56:43,725
I think there's a ton of interesting untapped questions there as well.

542
00:56:44,175 --> 00:56:50,685
And we could debate this, but I might call I might call it viral detection in the nose or in the respiratory tract.

543
00:56:50,805 --> 00:56:58,614
So. Okay. Thanks. You know, I have a question about the sauce.

544
00:56:58,615 --> 00:57:04,434
Could be, too. So are the Bivalent boosters going to become available in Nicaragua, do you know?

545
00:57:04,435 --> 00:57:11,095
And because it seems like a sort of a perfect cohort to look at, look at that and we're going forward.

546
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:16,855
I'm not I'm not sure I'm ready to know if that's going to be available, hopefully eventually.

547
00:57:17,125 --> 00:57:24,325
But there's been very little in any vaccine. I will say that the cohort is now highly vaccinated.

548
00:57:24,625 --> 00:57:31,524
Erin didn't kind of concentrated on that, on his on his presentation, but vaccines became available very late in Nicaragua.

549
00:57:31,525 --> 00:57:37,765
But at this point, vaccine uptake, at least in cohort participants, has been over 93%.

550
00:57:38,545 --> 00:57:49,615
But with a big mix of like Sputnik light, but Sputnik five, AstraZeneca, a bit of covishield that had come in early, some Pfizer.

551
00:57:50,635 --> 00:57:56,175
I'm trying to think of their. Oh, and then the Cuban vaccine. So Soberano and abdala for the children.

552
00:58:00,435 --> 00:58:03,235
So I'll ask my probing question now.

553
00:58:03,255 --> 00:58:15,795
So so you made a point, which I think is an important one at the beginning, that your model can account for household and community transmission.

554
00:58:16,185 --> 00:58:21,255
I'm wondering because we did some prospective household studies in the U.S.

555
00:58:22,725 --> 00:58:29,114
How you accounted for that? And if that might partially explain why you weren't seen with Omicron?

556
00:58:29,115 --> 00:58:33,795
Because there was more community transmission that overwhelmed that household transmission.

557
00:58:34,185 --> 00:58:43,424
Yeah. So the way that the way that the model works basically is it's running two pairwise accelerator failure time models in the background.

558
00:58:43,425 --> 00:58:48,615
So one is in contact in or both of an infectious individual with a susceptible person.

559
00:58:48,615 --> 00:58:53,865
So each each infectious person is paired with each susceptible person within the household.

560
00:58:54,315 --> 00:59:02,534
When somebody newly becomes infected, then they're also paired with everyone in that same and their time point of infectiousness,

561
00:59:02,535 --> 00:59:06,625
which in these models we used ten, ten days was closer once.

562
00:59:06,675 --> 00:59:13,595
That was the parameter that we used. And then what we do for the background is we have all the participants in the entire cohort.

563
00:59:13,605 --> 00:59:19,514
So all 2400 participants saying do they do they test positive for SARS-CoV-2?

564
00:59:19,515 --> 00:59:27,915
And at a time point independent of the household study, does that account for the difference?

565
00:59:27,975 --> 00:59:34,575
I would say no, because at the beginning we did not include that community transmission and we don't see changes

566
00:59:34,575 --> 00:59:40,995
necessarily in the associations and the direction of associations excluding an incidence.

567
00:59:48,205 --> 00:59:52,125
So in the last park. I'm sorry. No, no, no. You.

568
00:59:54,555 --> 00:59:58,155
He can do more.

569
00:59:58,165 --> 01:00:05,185
I guess this applies to both of the Chicago studies. I'm just curious what because you're looking at households in your studies,

570
01:00:05,665 --> 01:00:13,165
what consists of a household in Nicaragua and how might that differ than what we might think about as a household here?

571
01:00:13,165 --> 01:00:17,845
And if you think there that those results can be applied to a setting like in the U.S.

572
01:00:17,845 --> 01:00:21,505
or if there's different factors that we might have to consider when comparing the two.

573
01:00:21,565 --> 01:00:25,344
Yeah. So this is a little bit of an interesting debate within our group.

574
01:00:25,345 --> 01:00:34,585
So there's oftentimes there will be what we consider multiple households on one property that either, you know, shared some, some spaces.

575
01:00:34,945 --> 01:00:41,215
But for the definition of the transmission studies, they are limited to people that are part of the same family unit.

576
01:00:41,215 --> 01:00:49,495
So they usually have some familial relationship and it does not include people that live on the same plot of land that share maybe,

577
01:00:49,705 --> 01:00:56,185
you know, facilities or something like that. So it's really limited to those that you have most frequent interactions with.

578
01:00:59,315 --> 01:01:02,565
Thank you. And so my question was on the last target,

579
01:01:03,235 --> 01:01:07,014
you had the slide where like 2045 there is going to be a lower or not and I

580
01:01:07,015 --> 01:01:10,045
was making a mental note like that would be a perfect time to go to Brazil. Right.

581
01:01:10,375 --> 01:01:14,875
But but so how did you have it year by year?

582
01:01:14,875 --> 01:01:19,555
I mean, obviously it was just the model was like trading each year.

583
01:01:19,555 --> 01:01:23,935
How do you how did you have that year to year variation? I didn't quite understand that part.

584
01:01:24,235 --> 01:01:31,035
Yeah, I didn't go too much into depth with that. But basically there's this thing called CMC.

585
01:01:31,045 --> 01:01:39,265
It's the couple of model entrepreneurism projects and it's like climate scientists from around the world all develop different climate models,

586
01:01:40,015 --> 01:01:45,174
sort of projecting what they think various climatic variables are going to be like.

587
01:01:45,175 --> 01:01:48,775
So in our case we were just using temperature, but they also had like precipitation.

588
01:01:49,645 --> 01:01:53,155
It's like super complex and I don't really know how they do it,

589
01:01:53,155 --> 01:02:01,434
but basically I chose one of the models from this group and they provide the temperature

590
01:02:01,435 --> 01:02:08,545
for a set of coordinates basically every single day from like 2015 all the way to 2100.

591
01:02:09,085 --> 01:02:15,385
And so I can't really speak to like the statistical models behind like why 2049 was like so different.

592
01:02:15,475 --> 01:02:18,594
But it's basically just like the variation.

593
01:02:18,595 --> 01:02:22,555
It completely comes from the model that we're sourcing our temperature data from.

594
01:02:25,895 --> 01:02:39,815
So just to follow on to that, I'm curious if you account for the the temperature could also affect the rainfall in the length of rainy season,

595
01:02:39,815 --> 01:02:44,305
etc., that affects a mosquito lifestyle and a transmission.

596
01:02:44,315 --> 01:02:48,905
How should that be accounted for him and how would you account for that?

597
01:02:49,115 --> 01:02:53,305
Yeah, I would absolutely love to account for that because rainfall is extremely important.

598
01:02:53,315 --> 01:03:01,625
Humidity is extremely important. And we know that there is every mosquito biological trait is basically related to that.

599
01:03:01,985 --> 01:03:08,314
The problem with that is it introduces so much uncertainty into the model because I was doing some

600
01:03:08,315 --> 01:03:15,485
research on this and apparently precipitation is like notoriously more uncertain than temperature is.

601
01:03:16,175 --> 01:03:19,805
Usually climate forecasts are more accurate when it comes to temperature than precipitation.

602
01:03:20,195 --> 01:03:27,155
And so we're already dealing with so much uncertainty with the temperature because, you know, it's like adding precipitation.

603
01:03:27,155 --> 01:03:35,105
It would just I think you would just take it one step too far and add another layer that it's just I think it just wouldn't have been doable.

604
01:03:35,625 --> 01:03:38,975
Yeah, it's interesting because I mentioned typhoid and climate change.

605
01:03:38,975 --> 01:03:40,294
We don't think it's temperature.

606
01:03:40,295 --> 01:03:49,235
We actually get rainfall, which makes sense because you'd have more flooding or longer rainy seasons or but they're tied together in some way.

607
01:03:49,235 --> 01:03:54,425
So thank you. I would love to have super accurate precipitation for us.

608
01:03:56,615 --> 01:04:02,035
Well, I think I get really brief question since I get a lot of questions asking my later connection.

609
01:04:02,465 --> 01:04:07,895
If so, I am struck by how interesting it would be to apply this model to other areas of the world.

610
01:04:08,285 --> 01:04:12,575
If you could go to one other area, what would be kind of your next priority to do this?

611
01:04:12,575 --> 01:04:22,084
Kind of. Yeah, some studies they do it for like every single GPA is pertinent, but you can show like the figures graphs.

612
01:04:22,085 --> 01:04:25,655
When you do that, it's like, do you only get like one pixel per place, right?

613
01:04:26,355 --> 01:04:31,535
Um, I don't know. I think like I would probably want just out of curiosity to compare it with the rest

614
01:04:31,535 --> 01:04:37,265
of South America and then also compare it like maybe with south south Southeast Asia,

615
01:04:37,535 --> 01:04:41,175
because I think it's fairly endemic there. Yeah, I.

616
01:04:43,285 --> 01:04:46,555
All right. Well, thank you, everybody, for coming.

617
01:04:46,585 --> 01:05:00,125
Thank you so much for your presentation. Your competition, our speakers will be receiving a T-shirt and indeed cash prize.

618
01:05:01,355 --> 01:05:04,715
I'm sure you like one of those things better than me, so congratulations.

619
01:05:04,715 --> 01:05:13,285
And thank you. And I think we're all going to make your way down to 10 to 1 in the process for you to get ready for a chance.
