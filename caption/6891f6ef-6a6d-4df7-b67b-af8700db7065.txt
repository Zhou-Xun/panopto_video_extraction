1
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:14,400
Okay. So good morning everyone and welcome to Public Health 513 Policy Lab Section four.

2
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,930
My name is Brian Hicks and I will be your guest eye for this semester.

3
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,340
A couple quick things about me before we really deep dive.

4
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:26,400
Um, or correction, let's run it back.

5
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:34,110
Today's agenda, we're going to do GSI Student Introduction give you a brief overview of Canvas and where to look at your materials.

6
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:38,430
Um, intro to Policy Lab go over group assignments and questions.

7
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:43,200
So just a quick disclaimer. I am a commuting student.

8
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:50,570
I live about an hour away. For those of you who drive between trying to find parking and walking and, you know,

9
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:55,470
managed to get here, I pretty much kind of come in around the time that you saw me come in.

10
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:00,690
If you need to beat me earlier, I will try to get here earlier.

11
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:09,149
But I just practice that because we are in winter season so I my bad or trying to get here and understanding your bad or trying to get here,

12
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:12,330
we may have to go virtual. So I just want to let that be known upfront.

13
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:16,590
That'll be communicated in advance. Just look for your slack.

14
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:21,960
Cool. We use Slack last year. Just look for that announcement on campus.

15
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:26,960
And speaking of announcement, did everyone receive that announcement about where to meet today?

16
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:30,420
Okay. All right. All right.

17
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:34,980
So first thing, give me GSI and then meet your classmates.

18
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:38,509
So. Quick little background about me.

19
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:42,350
For those of you who may or may not have been here on that first class,

20
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:47,870
which is Monday, my name is Maria Hicks, born and raised here in Southfield, Michigan,

21
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:53,090
graduated from Harvard University for my undergrad and I am a current dual

22
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:58,729
m.p.h. and HSA candidate during my MPH in health behavior and health education,

23
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:05,870
as well as getting my Master's of Health Services Administration degree with a concentration in health management and policy.

24
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:11,930
So this is my last and final year and excited to be closing that out with you all.

25
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:19,520
Considering the fact that this is my third year with this course, I took it during my concentration as a student.

26
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:23,209
So any thoughts that you have? Please feel free to share them.

27
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:32,390
I completely get it. Being in your shoes when I first took this course as well as I taught this class previously regarding internship experience,

28
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:37,459
I spent one summer as a health care consultant with Deloitte and this past

29
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:42,110
summer intern with UnitedHealth Group and their Community and State Division.

30
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:52,430
Click background about me really interested in solutions that drive equitable and sustainable health care in underserved communities,

31
00:02:52,970 --> 00:03:01,580
both domestically and internationally. So bringing it back and also before we get into introductions, please bear with me,

32
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:06,230
considering the fact that the first two years this course was taught so virtual.

33
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:11,690
So this is my first time in-person, so we'll navigate any hiccups accordingly.

34
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:17,720
Now I like to call cold call anybody, but would anybody like to volunteer to kick us off?

35
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:23,240
Okay, you know, I can start. Okay, I'll start with you.

36
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:26,540
Just state your name, pronouns, department.

37
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,149
And if you feel so inclined to, I'm not going to make you.

38
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:35,389
But anything you're looking to gain better understanding out of this course and Hayley my pronouns

39
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:44,900
are she her hers and I am in the MPH program and my department is general epidemiologist Stephen.

40
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:49,850
My pronouns are heat him animals and epidemiology department and back up.

41
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:58,570
My pronouns are she her and I'm all about citizen and I'm glad my pronouns are here and I'm in the hospital.

42
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:02,150
Like, go out with you, tell them I will beat up my friend.

43
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:13,690
And she turned and I'm also in my age program and I see her and I'm also and each of those Mackenzie actually are sometimes I'm in the general.

44
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:18,530
I'm still Alexander I was in the Department of General.

45
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:29,690
I am Boucher and I'm from General AP as well and I use she recommends my name is Millie she her pronouns and I'm also here in the general

46
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:39,440
area just hoping to learn about health insurance and patient advocacy because I'm Sarah she knows I'm also in the general program.

47
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:45,920
My name is Abby. I use your program and I use her pronouns.

48
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:50,440
So I know with the Global Health Epidemiology Program as I'm in my second year,

49
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:56,420
that and then for this class I feel like with epidemiology we learn a lot, a lot about the research behind that.

50
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:59,690
I don't know a lot about policy, implementation and developing policy.

51
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:11,570
So generally in this class and everyone my name is again I use them pronouns and global health and hi my name is Paige she her class that I am

52
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:23,690
a subject that I'm having now I use your pronouns and I'm a second year for the health of the patient on him pronouns and I'm also the general.

53
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:30,290
Hi, my name is Alicia. Are you she her pronouns? I'm also a first year general and the student.

54
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:34,819
But I'm interested in health care policy effects. Hi, I'm Jenny.

55
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:44,160
I use your pronouns and I'm not muscular. I'm alone on your pronouns, and I'm okay.

56
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:48,210
Okay. I mean, I see.

57
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:51,330
Hold on to.

58
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:57,590
Hi, my name is Joe Cohan. Is he in Cambridge?

59
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:03,440
Okay. Thank you all for your introductions, for transparency.

60
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,130
I'm terrible with names, so if I ask you to write your name.

61
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:11,150
So sorry. Um, on Zoom, we had the luxury of saying your name up here.

62
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:15,350
So if you do have, like, those name tags, please bring em.

63
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:21,260
If not, bear with me if I ask your name, especially as some of you wear a mask.

64
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:26,480
Full disclosure with my class, whatever you're comfortable with, there's no mask mandate.

65
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:32,510
So if you want to wear one, by all means, wear one. If you don't want to wear one, perfectly fine.

66
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:41,509
All right. So some general expectations when emailing regarding any questions,

67
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:48,740
please use the format public health 513 followed by your section number and just to minimize delay.

68
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:57,230
Go ahead and CC Sheila or Professor Kennedy in it and expect 24 to 48 hours for response.

69
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,000
Class related. You'll hear me sometimes refer to Slack.

70
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:07,399
Last year we used Slack for discussions and any general questions you don't have to do

71
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:13,400
that in the works will be setting up a canvas discussion board for any general questions.

72
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:18,770
And regarding policy, you have prepared, come prepared and on time.

73
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:29,490
So from discussion expectations, how will be how will we be respectful of each other during our discussion sections?

74
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:36,290
So these are just some overall compilations of what you all did as an activity on Monday.

75
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:42,950
We felt that it was important to set the ground moving forward just because some of the cases that you will be working with,

76
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:49,430
which I'll talk about later, do have some sensitive or controversial.

77
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:55,620
Decision. Excuse me? It can be sensitive or controversial.

78
00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:03,270
So we want to use this policy lab as a learning experience and just kind of set that president precedent of that, you know,

79
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:08,250
just being open minded to other people's perspectives that you may or may not necessarily disagree with,

80
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:12,060
but also give your peers the opportunity to speak.

81
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:19,080
I feel like you all will learn the best by collaborating.

82
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:25,440
I get to see how the break out groups working in person and you'll be doing these policy labs in class.

83
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:29,610
So it's completely up to you what you would like to gain from this experience.

84
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:33,470
No need to further drag out discussion expectations.

85
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:43,560
I think we kind of all understand how we work in groups and just a general understanding of with some good group working skills to keep in mind.

86
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:47,940
So overview of Canvas. Really quickly.

87
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:55,840
There is no course syllabus. The syllabus is kind of embedded in the canvas page.

88
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:01,330
Canvas will give you an overview of the topics covered this semester.

89
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:04,330
If you haven't already, I assume you did.

90
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:13,390
You should have created that pre course assessment to give you access to the class from now until spring break, which will be coming around quickly.

91
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:18,310
February 23rd ish, you have access to Unit one.

92
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:28,480
They don't. They kind of overlap. So just we don't necessarily disregard what you learn in unit one when we go on to unit two.

93
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:35,770
It's all building blocks, but just broken up in a digestible format to help you learn the best as well as assignments.

94
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:38,910
So just a quick overview.

95
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:50,049
When you log into your page, you're going to go home to public health systems and management and policy courses or Public Health Systems.

96
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:53,590
Policy Management Records Assessment Unit one.

97
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:58,060
Unit two. Even when you click course syllabus.

98
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,959
Oh, change it this year. Hi, Ben. Hi.

99
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:07,320
Welcome. I'm sorry about that.

100
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:15,240
It used to be embedded, but nonetheless, just an overview of like what you expect to learn during this time.

101
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:20,970
Unit one it'll be set up for the week. Kind of doing a balance of, like, asynchronous learning.

102
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:30,870
So watch the lectures to get that baseline understanding, which Sheila will go over more in depth in on that Monday.

103
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:37,200
Here's some supplemental readings or mandatory readings that will help you

104
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:43,230
get additional understanding of relevant course content started at the time,

105
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:49,560
as well as just what to expect for the week. So I'll repeat it at the end.

106
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:58,590
Homework for this class is to read how to analyze a case that'll help you as we start preparing for our policy laps.

107
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:08,370
Moving back to the PowerPoint. So as mentioned Policy Lab, you'll be working on a case analysis.

108
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:13,920
I don't like to subject you all to time just because some cases are shorter than others.

109
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,640
But essentially for those who work better in like quantifiable metrics,

110
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:24,210
each week you will have approximately 40 to 50 minutes to create the case presentation slide deck with your group.

111
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:28,740
So in the case of this class, this class starts at 1010.

112
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:36,270
The way it's going to work is you're going to come in first ten to 20 to 15 minutes.

113
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:39,120
I'm going to recap what was learned on Monday,

114
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:48,600
and then I'm going to set you up with some frequently asked questions that may be related to either the case or what was posed in class.

115
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:52,080
Give you an overview of the case that you read.

116
00:11:52,110 --> 00:12:00,870
And hopefully by that 1020 mark, I will tell you, are two working your breakout routes where you'll be working 40 to 50 minutes,

117
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:12,360
cutting that working time at about 1105 11:10 p.m. to kind of come back and discuss in the class what your findings were and then.

118
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:18,490
We're not going to go to 1120. Sometimes we will pass 1120.

119
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:23,709
But essentially discussion between 1105, 1115 ish, give or take,

120
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:30,700
and then 1120 class concludes regarding those cases, cases are due at the end of class.

121
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:36,130
So we did build in some buffer room. This class is 10 a.m. to 1130.

122
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:41,680
You have until 12:00 if your group needs extra time to finish those cases.

123
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:47,190
This is not a take home assignment. This is not do it on your own time.

124
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,260
It's purely every Wednesday.

125
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:55,960
10 to 12 technically is your block to work on everything.

126
00:12:56,050 --> 00:13:04,720
Aside from doing the reading in advance, you do not need to do external research to support your case with everything that you're going to

127
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:12,970
need is going to be right in that Harvard Business case study book package that you'll purchase.

128
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:19,570
If the slide is turned in late without prior approval, they will be deducted accordingly.

129
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:27,550
With how? In accordance to how many days that assignment was late, you have to attend this discussion to get credit.

130
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:33,639
Please let me know if you cannot attend your discussion session section.

131
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:39,670
And for those who miss, I'm going to tell you which I'll get into like make up policies at the end.

132
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:50,640
But for those who do miss, I'm going to tell you when you do submit your makeup policy lab that it should not be the same as your your groups.

133
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:58,420
So unfortunately, if you miss your group, submit, you still can see what your group submitted when you do.

134
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:03,430
If it went in, if you do a makeup assignment, it should not look like your group.

135
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:13,240
But I'll delve into that later. But moving on to our case analysis, this is a format that you should be very familiar with.

136
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:23,830
You're always so how submission works for this class is you're going to have a slide, PowerPoint presentation.

137
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:31,300
It's going to be six, six slides. Is the minimum slash maximum requirement there's no need to make.

138
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:37,810
Ten slides, 12 slides. Some of the information is content dense.

139
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:41,010
So if it goes to like eight slides, that's okay,

140
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:47,850
but it really should be within six in the way you're going to structure your slides are you're going to have your first title page that says,

141
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:56,520
hey, we're group A, we consisted of Mary, Sally, Joe, John for this first week, if John or Sally wasn't there,

142
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:01,920
just put the names of the people who were there so that you can create credit excuse me, that you can receive credit.

143
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:10,170
And then your next slide will be your situation. Slide your question, slide hypothesis, slide proof and action and alternatives.

144
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:16,709
So you'll become more familiar with this when you read the How to Analyze the Case slide,

145
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:26,730
I want to preface this that some of you may have worked with consulting, and I know you have to do case analysis to prep for that interview.

146
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:36,120
Completely different case. I would basically say rely on this case analysis policy structure within the confines of this class.

147
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:42,720
As previously mentioned, many of you want to get more familiarity with the health management and policy side of things.

148
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:49,230
So this policy lab serves as a way to take you out of your traditional epidemiologist hat and get

149
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:54,750
you to thinking of how you would address these issues from a public health policy decision maker.

150
00:15:54,750 --> 00:16:02,190
ANGLE So kicking off, as I mentioned in that slide deck that you'll be submitting,

151
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:06,150
you're going to start with your situation each and every time you read a case.

152
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:11,100
You're going to identify the situation as a problem, decision or evaluation,

153
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:20,400
and you're going to describe any ideas about that framework or criteria that describes the situation and provides evidence as such.

154
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:31,410
So just to simplify, a problem is a situation in which something important has happened, but we don't know why did the decision is more so.

155
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:38,430
Or if you're choosing to decide and decide that that case is a problem, you'll refer to that.

156
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:44,190
If you're deciding that it's a decision, it's going to be a case organized around an explicit decision.

157
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:50,250
And an evaluation is an assessment or value of an effectiveness of an intervention.

158
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:56,580
Do not get stuck here. Do not get stuck here. This is very quick.

159
00:16:56,790 --> 00:17:03,779
It's like, hey, you know, based off this reading, did you all feel like this was a problem or decision and provide that supporting context?

160
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:11,340
I'm going to give an example that will hopefully provide more clarity, but this is not a place to get stuck.

161
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:17,250
Also, adding to this class, there's no right or wrong answer.

162
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:22,980
The way I'm going to great is as long as you can prove that it's correct, you will get credit.

163
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:29,370
So, for example, if I go outside and I see that the sky is blue because X, Y and Z, the sky is blue.

164
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:36,660
But if you tell me the sky is purple and you can say that because the way the sun hits the concrete and it actually gives a purple hue,

165
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,339
I will give you credit. So that's how I'm grading. It's not right or wrong.

166
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:44,520
As long as you can support it and back it up, you will receive credit.

167
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:52,320
So for an example, I do understand that you all have not read this opioid epidemic case.

168
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:57,030
This used to be a very popular case that was offered in previous course packs.

169
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:58,500
However, it is not bear.

170
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:08,040
So bear with me as I try to explain it and also understand that you have not read it to really get the full scope of how it will go.

171
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:13,390
So. Assuming that you ready the opioid epidemic.

172
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:18,700
Oh, my theology of AIS and I stated that this is a problem.

173
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:26,400
So when you're assessing that, it's a problem. Some of the questions that you might be thinking in the process is like, What is the problem?

174
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:32,230
What is the magnitude of the problem? Are we trying to account for failure, success, or is it more ambiguous?

175
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:37,540
These are some of the thoughts there that are going to appear or that hopefully you'll be thinking of.

176
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:44,110
So when you say it's a problem, you always have to provide supporting context, context or evidence.

177
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:52,900
So we felt that this was a problem because between 1999 and 2017, 400 Americans died from the opioid overdose.

178
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,240
That is essentially the gist of this whole case.

179
00:18:56,890 --> 00:19:05,740
This led many decision and policy makers to talk more about the opioid epidemic, despite increasing knowledge of the problem.

180
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:13,210
The last decade has seen an increase in overdose deaths from synthetic synthetic opioid such as fentanyl.

181
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:18,190
So stated that the situation. We stated that this is a problem.

182
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:22,540
Why is it a problem? Because of the supporting evidence provided below.

183
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,200
So. Um. Your questions.

184
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:33,690
These two. Sorry. Okay.

185
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:39,120
There we go. So the question side is going to be the slide that you're going to be providing

186
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:45,840
more supporting context of why you decided in the filing regarding the situation.

187
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:52,620
So regarding what questions do I need to adequately answer to or to adequately assess the situation?

188
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:59,640
If it if you're declaring that it's a problem, what is the problem that you are trying to address and who was responsible?

189
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:03,540
Here's where you identify any basically underlying factors.

190
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:08,100
If it is a decision, then what are the decision options and what is at stake?

191
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:12,090
If it is an evaluation? Who is responsible for that evaluation?

192
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:17,160
And what is the criteria or criteria and also within any problem?

193
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:24,689
What we're really trying to drive in this class is that we're bringing awareness to is that there is always an

194
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:30,450
issue of health equity or systemic racism that needs to be addressed in any of these cases that you'll read.

195
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:36,360
So we really want you to really start thinking outside the box. If you don't have any comfortability or familiarity with that,

196
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:42,990
what are some potential health equity and systemic racism issues that need to be addressed in this process?

197
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:49,860
But also primarily for, like I said, epidemiologists put your public health policy decision,

198
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:57,719
make your thinking hat on and really focus on some underlying mechanisms from that policy and health management decision.

199
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:03,960
ANGLE So this is for your question.

200
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:13,799
What is your problem that you're trying to address? The problem is that an increase in overdose deaths from synthetic opioids or excuse me,

201
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:19,800
there was an increase in opioid deaths from synthetic opioids over the last decade.

202
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:27,669
Who is responsible for this problem. There is no right or wrong answer here.

203
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:34,870
We just spewed out some different examples. So understanding that you are read this case, you would have come across that.

204
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,980
Multiple angles that you could approach the situation from.

205
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:47,590
In this case specifically, there were changing attitudes towards pain management that led to the opioid epidemic.

206
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:56,280
There was deceptive marketing campaigns and complicit or insufficiently trained physicians that contributed to the opioid.

207
00:21:57,310 --> 00:22:02,260
Their appeal mills, which dismissed high volumes of opioids in some part of the U.S.

208
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:10,030
There was intense, intense lobbying from drug manufacturers that contributed to the issue, as well as curative dominance.

209
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:17,790
So here are. Five examples of what could have contributed to this problem.

210
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:22,200
As long as you can provide 2 to 3, you'll get credit.

211
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:28,200
Since you have to answer What's the problem?

212
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:33,390
Who's responsible? And health equity. That's why I said it should be six sides.

213
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:38,580
But considering in this case, if you felt like you needed to address all of these five points,

214
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:42,030
this is where your slides could go over in that question mark.

215
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:46,500
Okay. You have one slide that's highlighting who's responsible.

216
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:53,280
But then on the next slide, you have or you you have the you have one slide highlighting the problem within.

217
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:59,760
On the next slide, you have who's responsible for the problem as well as what are the health equity considerations.

218
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:06,250
So as long as it's within that. Excuse me.

219
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:11,620
As long as it's within that kind of range, you won't be docked for going over on flights.

220
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:15,340
Regarding your health equity component.

221
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:25,270
Here are your proposed questions or statements of how can we reach marginalized communities, racial minorities, or rural areas?

222
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:32,470
Because those were the ones who didn't have access to the necessary pharmacies or prescription medications that they needed for whatever reason.

223
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:39,490
Or how can we ensure that the opioid epidemic doesn't disproportionately affect marginalized communities?

224
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,940
Moving forward, that will be your questions.

225
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:48,410
Excuse me. That will be it. Regarding that question inside.

226
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:59,210
Moving on to your hypothesis. Here is where you identify a hypothesis and describe how it will impact your problem, decision or evaluation.

227
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:05,000
So a hypothesis is a potential explanation that can explain the set of facts shown in the case.

228
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:08,930
A good hypothesis is one that can be tested empirically.

229
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:15,650
So here your choose the strongest explanation you're generating in that question and brainstorming section.

230
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:26,060
And as previously mentioned here, be sure to include how you address any issues of issues related to health equity and systemic racism.

231
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:31,160
So moving on to the examples, this is provided for simplicity purposes.

232
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:41,510
But I know from that traditional research component, most hypotheses are, you know, if such such happens, then this is the result.

233
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:48,590
Not asking you to do that at all here you should refrain from making a statement as an improve physician,

234
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:52,760
improve, improve physicians, pain management training.

235
00:24:52,790 --> 00:25:03,010
That's a statement. A hypothesis will look something like we recommend that to prevent the next opioid epidemic,

236
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:08,240
there needs to be more emphasis on private physician pain management training.

237
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:13,460
Acceptable. Why do you feel that way?

238
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,690
In the text, it would say something like, you know,

239
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:27,470
studies have showed that physicians relax days are lackadaisical at about their training or just careless about how many doses,

240
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:34,940
dosage, medications they prescribe. And therefore, we feel that this is an opportunity to help prevent the next opioid epidemic.

241
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:41,330
Those are what some of your supporting arguments would be if you're providing that following hypothesis.

242
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:51,320
Another example with reference to the case is that increasing transparency,

243
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:59,450
so something that also contributed to that opioid epidemic in the case is that there was a lack of transparency between the physicians,

244
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:02,090
lawmakers, policy, you name it.

245
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:12,650
So a hypothesis will look like, considering that price transparency was the sole reason for the spiral of the opioid epidemic,

246
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:18,110
providing more transparent parents in moving forward is a way to further prevent the issue.

247
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:25,110
Provide your support. Context and. You'll get full credit for your hypothesis.

248
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:32,010
And then a last example with regarding a potential direction that you can go in.

249
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:39,300
The hypothesis is that modifying payment and reimbursement schemes a little background.

250
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:44,800
A lot of health care is kind of changing to that value based care.

251
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:51,430
More so promoting quality and getting rewarded for quality of care as opposed to the number of patients seen.

252
00:26:51,700 --> 00:27:03,700
So here's an angle that you can go in to aspect, because there was incentive for physicians in this case that read that prescribing most there was

253
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:10,000
financial incentive for physicians that prescribe the most prescription medications during that month.

254
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:19,990
Changing how physicians are modified and reimbursed during this process is a way to prevent the another opioid epidemic.

255
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:23,560
That was that's the way that you can tackle that hypothesis.

256
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:28,480
Before I close out on hypothesis here, we wanted to iterate.

257
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:34,660
All of these happened in the case, but there's no right or wrong answer in which direction that you can go in.

258
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:39,370
As long as you feel that you can provide support, you'll get credit.

259
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:44,989
So. Moving on to that proof in action.

260
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:56,140
Slide correction. Provide context for the hypothesis will provide more support in the you in the proof in action side.

261
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:00,640
So the proof is the evidence that you have to support your hypothesis.

262
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:06,700
And then here you should also consider what additional evidence is needed to support that hypothesis.

263
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:12,910
The action is how you will go about implementing that decision that you're recommending in your hypothesis.

264
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:24,910
So bringing it back to the case example the proof is that whichever hypothesis that you chose, there are statistics on opioid consumption,

265
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:34,480
overdoses in death by race and economic status that will further prove the reason why we need to adopt this hypothesis or the data.

266
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:43,840
One. The financial ties between opioid and physician is another reason that we are proposing the hypothesis to prevent this issue.

267
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:57,560
Your action is. The opioid prescriptions and pain management will follow revised guidelines drafted by professional societies.

268
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:04,100
So it's I kind of in that aspect of how do you guess you're stating this, but how do you make it actionable?

269
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:09,440
How do you bring it into context? How do you make sure that it happens in this case scenario?

270
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:19,759
Other actionable ways to address this is that state health departments and the FDA should have one shared central system in which allows them

271
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:30,050
to collect data and monitor opioid prescriptions as well as a potential supporting answer is federal health agencies will work with the state.

272
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:37,100
And county health officials and some community leaders to create consistent and effective messaging to communicate risk.

273
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:40,640
So that drive hypothesis, you had the proof that didn't need it.

274
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:49,190
But how are these actions? How are these proposals actionable or how do you make them actionable?

275
00:29:50,330 --> 00:30:00,880
And then lastly, you'll conclude. Any weaknesses in your hypothesis would provide to alternatives to what you're recommending.

276
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:08,380
And in this process, you would describe how these alternatives might be stronger or weaker based on your responses to the case.

277
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:18,070
So based on whichever hypothesis that you chose in the beginning, your alternative might be.

278
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:27,120
In the UK. Sorry, you just drew a blank in one of the hypotheses where it said Implement pain management training.

279
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:33,540
Maybe a weakness in that pain management position training is that although we

280
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:38,070
know that pain management training is the sole cause of the opioid epidemic,

281
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:48,000
research says that it's expensive to. Provide pain management training to physicians across the board.

282
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:53,880
That's not set in stone. I just made that up as an example to show you that would be the weakness in your hypothesis.

283
00:30:54,690 --> 00:31:00,150
And by proposing that weakness, your alternative based on whatever hypothesis you chose,

284
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:12,720
is that restricting the use of opioids to cancer patients who are weaker would restrict the use of opioids to cancer patients.

285
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:23,350
Because they're weaker or it's medically appropriate and unfair to patients suffering from chronic pain or trauma.

286
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:24,899
I realized that could have been written better,

287
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:38,010
but isn't that essentially a better way to say this would just be to restrict the use of opioids to patients with high medical priority?

288
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:46,510
That would be an alternative. Another alternative would be strengthening the regulatory oversight for opioid manufacturing.

289
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:55,260
But the FDA may not have the capacity or resources to closely monitor drug manufacturers during the pre and post-market phases.

290
00:31:55,500 --> 00:32:00,070
Those would be some alternatives. Weaknesses.

291
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:03,520
Weaknesses should always be before the alternatives.

292
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:07,390
But in this case, as long as they're on the side, you'll get credit for them.

293
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:14,620
In this case, weaknesses. There is political and private sector pushback against measures seeking to improve transparency,

294
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:22,660
revising pain management guidelines and changing attitudes about pain management takes time and won't solve the current crisis.

295
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:29,020
So that also gives you an angle to think about it. Some of you might be solving this from a long term point.

296
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:35,680
Some of you might be solving this from a. 30, 60, 90 day implementation.

297
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:39,160
As long as the support is consistent, you will receive credit.

298
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:47,610
So as I mentioned earlier, when you're submitting these slide decks both on an individual and group basis,

299
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:55,440
it should always have the following format covered slide situation, question, hypothesis, proof, action.

300
00:32:55,710 --> 00:33:01,800
Therefore six slides. If it goes over, as long as it's reasonable, you'll still receive credit.

301
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:09,209
I've had some students who are very artistic and want to express themselves as such and you know,

302
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:16,920
they had different templates for each submission, if that's what you want to do, by all means, you don't get extra credit for it.

303
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:20,129
I'm sorry, but there's no pressure to make.

304
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:23,520
Your slides are pretty as if you want to do this standard. Whatever.

305
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:26,940
You open Google slides in and just submit it like my group did.

306
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:37,110
By all means, you can do that as well. Moving on into the late work policy, as always, we're understanding.

307
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:41,760
But you know, submit your assignments on time.

308
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:47,550
I'd encourage whatever happens, come speak to me or email me sooner rather than later.

309
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:53,940
Each late work policy will be approved on a case by case basis.

310
00:33:54,450 --> 00:34:03,030
However, we have implement it that each student is eligible for one extension for any reason for three days among the following assignments.

311
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,380
But please, please contact me in advance.

312
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:16,740
I'm speaking from both the student and the GSI as I talk about these to assignment these assignments briefly in the health system assignment.

313
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:21,660
Don't wait for the last minute to do it. As a student, I waited till the last minute to do it.

314
00:34:21,910 --> 00:34:26,640
I was still fine. But that assignment is right do right before break.

315
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:30,690
You don't want to spend your break doing that assignment. It's not fun.

316
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:36,000
I mean, it's fun, but doing it as a break is coming up.

317
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,580
It's not fun and we'll kind of work.

318
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:47,950
Maybe like a month out to kind of get your wheels spinning on how to assess that health assignment, the budgeting and negotiation exercises.

319
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:52,059
Those are not bad. So I wouldn't belittle the ability.

320
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:56,380
It's the assignment. Many of you are second years or final years.

321
00:34:57,070 --> 00:35:03,450
Get that done as soon as possible. You do not. Graduation for us is the 27th.

322
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:09,380
You do not want to prolong advocacy assignment out any longer than it needs to.

323
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:16,660
Once, once again, we are understanding. But from student experience, please don't do with yourself, please.

324
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:23,560
But any additional extensions will be available only in emergent situations.

325
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:33,430
Policy lab attendance and regarding policy lab policies.

326
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:38,140
So we recognize that this can be a challenging time for students.

327
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:42,940
Policy lab presentations will be completed in teams during your discussion section.

328
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:50,260
Students who are unable to attend discussion and work in their teams due to extenuating circumstances can submit

329
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:58,180
individually developed case presentations on the same case that was covered in the policy lab discussion that was missed.

330
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,720
This will replace the participation with their team.

331
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:11,590
This makeup assignment will be available for up to two policy lab presentations without penalty and must be submitted within a week of the policy lab.

332
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:18,490
So like I said, class will be 10 to 1120 or 1130 what it formally says.

333
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:24,580
Your policy lab is due at 12 of that day. For some reason, if you're not going to be here.

334
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:30,350
Next week, your policy lab for section four is due.

335
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:36,750
What's it over 11? Your policy lab is due the 18th at 12 p.m.

336
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:41,629
That will be the format if you have to make do a make up lab.

337
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:43,680
But by all means, please contact me first.

338
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:50,060
And when you do, or if you have to make up, please email at me so it won't override like the submission in canvas.

339
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:57,900
Last steps before we conclude my office hours.

340
00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:02,730
I'm still setting them up, but I also wanted to check in with you all.

341
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:08,340
I think this is the first time we've actually had the same degree concentration.

342
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:12,390
Normally it'll be mixed up with like somebody from MHRA, DHS,

343
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:25,230
Adrian G Do you all have a like mandatory class Wednesday 1130 to 1230 or like Friday to Friday?

344
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:30,130
1132 1239. Maybe.

345
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:38,270
Yes. No. Okay. But my office hours will be virtual for the most part, and they'll be ten minute fly and sign up slots.

346
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:44,270
Just because I think somebody else has this room. So I'll just have to do it virtually.

347
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:49,700
But they are me. I'm a student too, so I'm as I'm walking to my next destination.

348
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,150
If you have a question, you want to carry it that way.

349
00:37:53,330 --> 00:38:02,130
Always able to do that. I. Shouldn't be doing this, but for some reason I am up doing work.

350
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:05,460
So if you get an email from me, it's who I am.

351
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:09,870
Don't need to respond back. It it just is what it is.

352
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:15,660
You understand the grad school struggle. So when I respond is when I respond.

353
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:18,290
I'm pretty good about checking my email.

354
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:30,450
And if you put that section, public health section for public health by 13, section four, I'll be able to look for a clicker before we finish.

355
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:38,010
The one thing that I really want to do while we're here and I hope it works is you're going to be signing up for groups.

356
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:44,800
So on the campus page. When you click people.

357
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:53,210
When you can hook people, there's going to be a everyone tab is going to be a case group analysis.

358
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:58,760
There's going to be discussion sections. I think that's for me.

359
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:04,820
And then there's going to be project groups. You're going to do the Case Analysis Group tab.

360
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:09,470
You're going to see it. Whoever your GSI is it me?

361
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:19,070
But for this case example, if you're Maya Wednesday, you're going to drag and drop your name to the zero out of five section.

362
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:23,660
So I'm going to ask you all to do that within the next 5 minutes.

363
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:26,630
You're going to choose your group, whoever you want to work with in this class.

364
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:43,470
Can't work with somebody in the Friday section, but you'll have groups 4 to 5, and that is how we will have groups moving forward.

365
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:48,750
Once they are solidified, you can't change them. And that will be the group.

366
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:53,820
When I say movements here, breakout groups. That's what you'll move into.

367
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:59,819
I'm not going to do a sign signing, but considering I can't just click you all the way and you dispersants here,

368
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:09,719
breakout rooms might be beneficial to actually sit next to your group coming in at class next Wednesday.

369
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:15,570
So I'm gonna give you like 5 minutes to do that just so I can make sure it works on this end and then we'll pick it back up.

370
00:40:23,080 --> 00:41:01,950
I just of a new sheriff agencies in terms of trying to move or to pay as you go to a building.

371
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:19,230
There's a song for some other Hey, yeah, yeah, we know a lot about it because I think we can search for train.

372
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:30,270
Anybody who had success yet was dragging and dropping or, you know, it's like our screen doesn't look like that.

373
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:41,440
So somebody screamed, you know, so you just didn't get to come to your world.

374
00:41:42,310 --> 00:41:53,850
Yeah, I know. I mean, I hear, you know, there's another school.

375
00:41:54,290 --> 00:42:05,400
All right. So for an example, not to put you all on spot for those who were able to join appear apparently on your site, you can just click join.

376
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:10,710
So if you find yourself without a group, it is 4 to 5.

377
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:21,300
So if you don't have a group, maybe you could join group for a if you do have a group and you're at five, clearly you can't join.

378
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:30,900
But that's how it all the way. There's a main question that was raised by a lot of discussion.

379
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:50,700
But again, it's a fun you can and I think if 25 students giving away.

380
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:54,360
And how did you pick this up? I've never seen this.

381
00:42:54,810 --> 00:42:59,460
Yeah, right. Professor Kennedy, she set this up.

382
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:06,450
I don't know how to set it up, but in one of my business classes, we've had to drag and drop to sign up.

383
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:11,040
And I think I don't know if it allows you to switch.

384
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:15,570
In my case, I wasn't allowed to switch, which I was, you know.

385
00:43:15,870 --> 00:43:21,660
Okay, now I was not already. Oh, my God.

386
00:43:21,870 --> 00:43:26,159
Oh, my God.

387
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:33,510
This is our presentation.

388
00:43:34,830 --> 00:43:52,020
This was an easy way to do that. Okay, now you have to talk to your family member like I don't want to be.

389
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:57,090
I like working with you. I'm all right.

390
00:43:57,810 --> 00:44:04,350
I'm gonna give you one more minute, and I'm gonna give you all one more minute.

391
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:11,280
And then if you're already. If your room is already created, great.

392
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:15,210
If not, one more minute, and then I'm going to close this out, and then we'll get out early.

393
00:44:19,470 --> 00:44:24,900
Yeah, yeah. I was going to ask a question that needs to be successful.

394
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:45,120
And if I could just log like, Yeah, yeah, like, this is what I like to.

395
00:44:47,790 --> 00:45:00,060
I just to at the assignment is out with publishing and I know that individuals have been mentioned as a possible.

396
00:45:02,090 --> 00:45:07,550
I'll give you a quick one. All right.

397
00:45:07,570 --> 00:45:12,520
I'm going to ask you all if you switch seats. Just have you all returned back to your seats.

398
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:20,570
And then what closes out in the next 5 minutes and give you all 35, 45 minutes back to you.

399
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:27,160
All right. So as previously mentioned, some last steps are those virtual hours sign up in advance by appointment.

400
00:45:27,490 --> 00:45:31,180
Walk with me to next class. However, depending on the length of your question.

401
00:45:31,390 --> 00:45:35,420
Very flexible with it. There was a question that came up regarding submissions.

402
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:40,870
Our policy lab will they'll be individual submissions and policy lab or is it only group submissions?

403
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:48,730
You will have group submissions in policy lab assuming that you don't miss any class or policy lab discussion.

404
00:45:48,730 --> 00:45:57,580
If you do miss a policy lab discussion, you're going to submit that individually and email me regarding the different assignments that I mentioned,

405
00:45:57,580 --> 00:46:00,740
like unit one, help system budgeting exercises.

406
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:11,830
Those are all individual. So you'll submit those individually regarding how to access these classes and some next steps for next week.

407
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:19,270
Come prepare to conduct a policy analysis on January the 1918.

408
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:26,650
Whatever that class day is, come prepared. You're going to do so by purchasing the course pack from the Harvard Business School.

409
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:32,500
It should be linked in the on the campus web page.

410
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:37,720
Your first reading is How Geisinger Health Reduce Opioid Prescriptions.

411
00:46:38,290 --> 00:46:46,210
And if the case analysis that we went over was a little fuzzy for you are by all means,

412
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:52,600
please read how to analyze a case that'll give you more context of how to analyze it

413
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:58,870
from this public health policymaker decision angle regarding the Harvard course pack,

414
00:47:00,370 --> 00:47:04,070
you're going to go to home, you know.

415
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:07,389
Wait a minute. Yep.

416
00:47:07,390 --> 00:47:14,170
So you're going to go to home. And I apologize if it does not look the same when you're in, but you're going to go to home click syllabus.

417
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:20,350
And then you're going to enter here for the course, Peg.

418
00:47:21,010 --> 00:47:28,630
This, of course, Peg, does have a cost. So be prepared to pay for that to access there.

419
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:32,620
I don't think that's anything we can waive. That's beyond my scope.

420
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:41,920
If there's any financial difficulties with paying for the course, peg, please email me separately and CCR professor.

421
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:45,610
Any other than that?

422
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:56,740
Are there any questions? Yes, I will be glad to be posted somewhere.

423
00:47:57,730 --> 00:48:01,150
Yes, they should. We're working out that before.

424
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:08,110
Like I said on Slack, it was just the group. I would just send them to you after class and you would have them.

425
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:15,820
I'm going to double back to one when we posted where that was posted and any other questions?

426
00:48:21,470 --> 00:48:25,790
All right. Well that is offer me. It is lovely meeting you all today.

427
00:48:25,790 --> 00:48:43,759
Are looking forward to getting to know you and working with you all this semester and nice for them.

428
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:48,790
And I think it has been hard to believe.

429
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:54,870
Yeah, sure. Excuse me.

430
00:48:56,450 --> 00:49:03,760
I thought I might even be able to avoid Massachusetts.

431
00:49:08,870 --> 00:49:33,010
I'm so glad that you have the why when we all know that to make it.

432
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:42,980
And now we learned this.

433
00:49:42,990 --> 00:49:58,270
Yes, but yes, I have to say something about yourself.

434
00:50:00,570 --> 00:50:15,380
I wasn't sure. I mean, you know.

435
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:48,730
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

436
00:50:48,830 --> 00:50:54,740
I'm trying to remember that the last year I saw that right.

437
00:50:55,050 --> 00:50:59,570
That's right here in the U.S. class.

438
00:50:59,570 --> 00:51:09,720
But no more than that once year, because I know there is one day the manager I usually I get like, you know Leo fliers,

439
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:30,610
I don't want to cut the articles that once they say, oh, now I have to do something else, but what the well, we'll figure it out next class.

440
00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:47,200
You can do that? Yeah. He's looked at some of the 20th century stuff to some degree.

441
00:51:55,990 --> 00:52:11,880
Want you to know that.

442
00:52:12,310 --> 00:52:34,920
I think I know what you're saying, and I know I.

443
00:52:47,340 --> 00:53:00,760
In. Oh, that's right.

444
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:25,480
I think I was using the tone of the transcript anyway, but I don't want to do that.

445
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:59,920
Right. Yeah.

446
00:54:05,630 --> 00:54:29,040
Who's the man who used to practice?

447
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:56,220
Try. Hmm.

448
00:55:16,370 --> 00:55:20,590
Wait my hand. Where is it?

449
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:29,020
If the arrow opened at a quarter. Stop!

450
00:55:29,710 --> 00:55:30,130
Stop!
