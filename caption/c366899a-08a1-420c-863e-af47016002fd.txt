1
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:11,350
All right. Okay.

2
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:19,820
So today I'm going to talk about living in a world of uncertainty now that we're living in a post-racial United States.

3
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:23,840
I just want to give a little bit of context about why this is something that I'm

4
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,190
really passionate about and how this ties in with my career in genetic counseling.

5
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,950
So I'm planning on being a prenatal genetic counselor after I graduate and and prenatal genetic counseling.

6
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:38,209
We work with a lot of patients who have late term abortions because we're working with people

7
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:44,160
who have anomalies found on ultrasound that might be from a lethal or severe genetic condition.

8
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:49,880
So it's really important to me as a provider that my patients have all of the options on the table in front of me.

9
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:59,760
So just a little quick rundown. Some of the main types of bands that are kind of involved in this that we'll talk about art of spatial balance.

10
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,160
So that's what people are typically familiar with, like a six week ban, 20 week ban, etc.

11
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:11,480
Pre-roll bands are important stuff like what we have in Michigan. So it's a 1931 band that was still on the books.

12
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:15,200
They just essentially get like an activated after Roe was put in place.

13
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:20,480
And then now that Roe is gone, depending on the state and how things are played out, those might be in place now.

14
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:23,809
And then the other important type of band is trigger bands.

15
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:30,920
So these are bands that were specifically designed to go into effect either immediately or very quickly after Roe v Wade is overturned.

16
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:38,310
So examples of that would be like in Louisiana or in Tennessee. There's, I think, 13 states that had trigger bands next.

17
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:43,310
So just a little bit of quick background there.

18
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:47,540
So like decades of lead up to all of this, but we don't have 3 hours to go over that.

19
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:55,759
So what is quickly run through dogs really quick? So in 2018, that's when the state of Mississippi enacted their 15 week ban.

20
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:59,710
And then that was subsequently challenged by the Jackson Women's Health Organization.

21
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:00,860
They got that blocked.

22
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:09,860
And in June 2020, Mississippi appealed to the US Supreme Court at this point in time with the five, four majority or conservatives.

23
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:17,120
And then December 20, 21, six three Conservative majority on the court, the court took it up for their arguments.

24
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,040
That was when we knew things were not looking good.

25
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:29,180
And then April 20, 21, this past year, season had the draft opinion that was going to overturn Roe v Wade got leaked.

26
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:34,670
And then subsequently in June 2024, 2022, v Wade got overturned.

27
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:41,959
So arguably, I mean, this was like six months ago. You might say that this is not a current event, but over the next handful of slides,

28
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:47,690
I'm going to highlight why this very much is a current event and something that we are still working on next.

29
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:55,980
So this is. Producer of this is America with Roe v Wade in place.

30
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:59,590
This is pre overturn here. And just to kind of explain some of the graphics.

31
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:07,900
Gallagher Institute has classified all of the states depending on certain types of restrictions and certain types of protections.

32
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:15,760
And based on what they have in place in each state, they've classified them on this sliding scale, going from most restrictive to most protective.

33
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:20,860
So in the visual, essentially, if something is dark red like this, that means that there's a total ban.

34
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:24,279
If it's dark orange like that, that usually means there's a six week ban.

35
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:28,870
And then, you know, these yellow ones are just kind of in between with a mix of restrictions and protections.

36
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:36,310
So you can see here at this point, this is after the league. So Oklahoma said okay and put their ban through because we knew it was coming.

37
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:42,700
Texas still had their six week bounty hunter ban in place. And then if you go to the next slide.

38
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:47,350
So this is the first this is Monday after Roe v Wade got overturned.

39
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:51,010
So you can see dark red, lots of those trigger bans went into effect.

40
00:03:52,330 --> 00:04:00,250
And then over the last five, six months, things have just continue to shift and change, like on a weekly or monthly basis.

41
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,720
And being a provider in that space is really difficult when the laws are changing all of the time.

42
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:13,030
So if you go to the next slide, just don't click. So you can see over months, weeks, all of this playing out in real time here.

43
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:18,180
It's constantly shifting that you create this wheel.

44
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:23,860
So I had I just took like all the, like the screenshots and then I just like did a little animation to my website.

45
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:28,510
I thought it would really highlight just how much this is changing.

46
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:32,320
And so this is dated October 10th, but this is the current map at this point.

47
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:39,040
So I believe there's 12 states with total bans. There is Arizona's a little bit messy?

48
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:44,260
That's a little bit messy right now. But Georgia has a six week ban and there's a couple of different states with 15 make bans.

49
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,040
So you can see it just got progressively more dark red.

50
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:53,950
And then you can also see access is looking really, really iffy in here.

51
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:59,790
And people are having to drive across multiple states at this point to access care and for you to be able to see.

52
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:07,149
All right. So the next slide. So what happens when abortion gets banned?

53
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:10,950
Well, like I was just saying, there's a multitude of things.

54
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:19,000
First off, clinics closed. And when I say close, I don't just mean like stopping offering abortion services or clinics that fully closed down.

55
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:24,309
So good marker institute to study that 100 days out from the overturn 26

56
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:28,780
clinics had fully closed down and 66 total had stopped offering abortion care.

57
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:34,410
Additionally, like I was saying, the drive times to access abortion care increased greatly.

58
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:39,850
There was a new study in JAMA that actually just came out last week that was saying the average drive

59
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:46,630
time or average travel time went up from 27.8 minutes pre overturned to 100.4 minutes posts overturned.

60
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:50,409
And I mean, frankly, that feels low because everything is averaged out right.

61
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:54,160
Like if you're living in the south, it's over an hour and a half to get somewhere.

62
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,899
You're having to drive across multiple states to access care at this point. And then additionally,

63
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:04,330
there was increased maternal mortality when there are abortion plans in place because people are having

64
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:09,550
unsafe pregnancies where you can access care if you have a high risk pregnancy and you need an abortion.

65
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:15,070
There's also people who are not able to access safe abortions.

66
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:20,170
So people will self-manage abortions in unsafe ways because they don't have other options.

67
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:27,579
And a recent study at University of Colorado, Boulder, was looking at and seeing if there were to be a nationwide ban in place,

68
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:31,090
there would be approximately a 24% increase in maternal mortality.

69
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:35,680
And that number, of course, is higher for people of color x three.

70
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:43,630
So who's affected by abortion bans? You know, I would say overall, anyone with a uterus was of reproductive age,

71
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:49,390
but specifically whether or not people of color are disproportionately affected by abortion means

72
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:55,630
they're more likely to have lower socioeconomic status and with that access to health care,

73
00:06:56,110 --> 00:07:02,290
more likely to be on Medicaid. And the issue there is that per the Hyde Amendment, federal dollars cannot go to abortion care.

74
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:04,930
So if you're on a medicaid abortion care, it's not going to be covered.

75
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:10,450
And additionally, it's just hard to take time off work and to travel and have the means to do so.

76
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:18,430
So there's a couple different scenarios there. The New York Times laid out a handful of these.

77
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:26,469
And I'm curious looking at this first one, so this is someone who needs hospital based care because of a fetal anomaly.

78
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:30,280
And I will say with a little more context that would be likely later in pregnancy.

79
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:36,190
How much do people think that an abortion would cost for this scenario?

80
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:39,580
Does anyone have any guesses, any ideas on the procedure cost for that?

81
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:46,720
This is in Chicago. This will be if you're traveling from Wisconsin to likely Chicago.

82
00:07:49,270 --> 00:08:00,870
Guess it's. Is it around a thousand or over a thousand, which is within two years, as we said, by like next year?

83
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,519
So just the procedure alone is 3450.

84
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:08,680
So the later on in pregnancy, the more expensive it's going to be because it's not just the two you'll see.

85
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:15,380
And then when you factor in travel, hotel, food, etc., all of that, that's a really high cost.

86
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:22,850
So let's think about the other scenario where someone is eight weeks pregnant so a lot earlier and they're seeking medication,

87
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:26,690
abortions, abortion pills. What do you think the procedure cost is for that?

88
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:35,040
I'm. 20.

89
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:39,990
So it's still $640. So, so expensive.

90
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:45,960
And then again, if you're having to travel just to go get these pills, that adds all of these other costs.

91
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:52,229
So having a procedure or getting access to these pills is expensive in the first place.

92
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:55,620
And then when you factor in all of these other things, it's just even more inaccessible.

93
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:06,180
But that is where abortion funds come in. And so for my nonprofit, I chose the Coble Abortion Fund, which is located in Colorado, where I'm from.

94
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:13,980
And their mission is that they're committed to working toward a future where no person of person faces a financial barrier to the care that they need.

95
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:18,590
And they believe abortion is health care and nothing should stand between you and your health decisions.

96
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,230
So they also this is kind of a discussion we've had on the dig a little bit.

97
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,350
They also have a CE for arms, so that's cobalt advocates.

98
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:31,969
I've got a little bit of lobbying with them and they were formerly a branch of all pro-choice America,

99
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:37,250
but they in 2020 split off because they want to really focus on Colorado itself.

100
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:46,100
So, you know, given the costs and everything wrapped up in travel, accessing procedures, etc.,

101
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:51,500
it's going to be really important to have abortion funds around for people to be able to have the means to do so.

102
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:54,919
You know, they've been around a different forms like friends and family back in the day,

103
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:58,580
but they've gotten much more formalized in the last 20, 30 years.

104
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:07,520
And they're just even more important moving forward right now. So for Cobar Services they provide procedure funding.

105
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:10,850
They can also help pay for lodging for people who are traveling.

106
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:14,420
They help line up and get assistance for travel.

107
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:19,550
It sounds like that's a little bit of a messier process for them, but they do have a means to help people with that.

108
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:25,760
And then they also try to provide reimbursement for food costs and everything for people who are traveling and staying in Colorado.

109
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:30,559
And a really important thing, too, is that this fund can be used by anyone.

110
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:35,270
It's not just for people living in Colorado. This is for people who travel to Colorado for abortion care.

111
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:41,310
And Colorado has a really long history of being a safe haven for abortion.

112
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:45,630
It's one of the few states that has offered late term abortions for a long time.

113
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:51,989
Dr. Hern in Boulder, Colorado, is someone that in genetic counseling, like we refer patients there for late term abortions.

114
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:59,790
I know people in the field across the U.S. refer to them. And the other thing, too, is at this point,

115
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:06,839
because there was such a massive influx of people from all these states and Colorado right now, wait times have gone way up.

116
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:10,590
So it's getting even harder for even people living in the state to access abortion as well.

117
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:14,129
Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains was reporting that their wait time and

118
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:17,940
this is just a few weeks after the overturn went from 2 to 3 days to two weeks.

119
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:23,190
So I don't even know what it looks like at this point. I couldn't find numbers on that, but I'm assuming it's not any better.

120
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:31,440
Yeah. So in terms of the discussion, my first question, I'm curious what people think.

121
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:39,450
Abortion funds. I got a lot of donations and because people were rage giving, you know, after the league and after the overturn of everything.

122
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:43,620
But at some point this is kind of the new normal and those are probably going to dwindle.

123
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:51,150
So I'm curious what people think nonprofits like Co-op can do to try to maintain a steady flow of funding moving forward.

124
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,250
So I want to just add to your question because it's an excellent presentation.

125
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:10,550
Just to add to that question and maybe everyone kind of also consider this is a good example of.

126
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:17,570
Organizations in the moment where there is an impetus to give,

127
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:23,359
but then the organization is now filling the social need that the government is not providing,

128
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:30,200
that there's not anything else to provide that service the the organization itself.

129
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:37,900
Is it adequate or is it appropriate to serve all the different people who need it?

130
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,490
And, you know, what's the path to sort of having it be sustainable in that regard?

131
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:51,260
You know, it's not just limited to a few people who were able to get services until the organization doesn't have the resources anymore to do it.

132
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:56,370
Yeah. Going back to branding like tying brands together.

133
00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:11,220
I know I don't know the details about this, but I can't say when they are giving all of the money from any purchases to apportion funds.

134
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:19,050
And if someone clicks like I don't want my money to go to abortion funds, they add an extra $5 if you want to buy a car.

135
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:27,680
And so I could see like potential for like friends like that or like that.

136
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:35,810
And Jerry's doing co-branding thing with abortion clinics because or abortion funds because if somebody is going to not buy because of that,

137
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:39,600
they're not going to buy that already. So I can see.

138
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,570
Nonprofit collaboration.

139
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:57,680
You may have sort of just said, oh, I hear you here, but I know there are like a lot of companies who are saying, I don't pay for for.

140
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,520
So yeah, like I think there's like grants and stuff instead of just providing for their employees.

141
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:13,930
Nonprofits like this. If people don't have our thoughts, we can go to the second one.

142
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:19,629
So what? I mean, the obvious way to fix all this is to just get ready for shutdowns.

143
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:25,690
Right? But in the absence of repealing those, what else could be done on the advocacy or policy side to help mitigate costs?

144
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:29,590
You know, there's like as you'd find with, like Medicaid, all of this stuff, what else can be done?

145
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:35,110
I mean, this assurance if I, like, improve public transit.

146
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:43,500
Not across the complete state lines, but that would mean it would be something of cheaper access.

147
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:52,420
And I do think it's something that I've been working with about.

148
00:14:52,800 --> 00:15:03,690
I like making contraceptive access like stronger and policy, like protecting it within policy and also like certain,

149
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:08,490
I guess, policies in like laws of the states like don't necessarily like medication abortion.

150
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:17,910
So like I guess trying to protect the other methods that are still possible in order to make reproductive access a choice.

151
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:24,059
But also like to the first question to something that I've been noticing and like meetings or

152
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:29,129
like public events is a lot of people talking about a lot of like science and stuff like that,

153
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:33,060
talking about giving to like black and brown abortion fights.

154
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:40,950
So I think like as. I think those issues become more exposed to the light and stuff.

155
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:45,750
I think people are offering like abortion funds as something that you can view as like a call to action.

156
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:50,880
So I think like keeping abortion balance as a call to action will also help to maintain credibility.

157
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:00,829
I can turn it over. I'd like to ask one follow up question.

158
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:06,620
This is maybe a provocative question for people. Just consider because it relates to our discussion last week or the week before.

159
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:15,559
So if the math continues to look as it does where there's differences between states and if

160
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:22,340
organizations like Cobalt now become sort of this become sort of their model to deliver these programs,

161
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:35,700
what is their incentive? To advocate for those policy changes if their organization is now set up, funded and philanthropically granted to do this.

162
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:41,760
I'm going back to thinking back to Ali's presentation about March of Dimes.

163
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,010
What do we think you should set up to, like do a.

164
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:56,620
Yeah. Like, if their whole system is all set up on abortion funds and travel and they've got people donating and they've got philanthropists,

165
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:59,739
they've got boards, they've got a whole infrastructure built around.

166
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:05,930
This is it. It's. What happens to them if now the law changes again?

167
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:10,990
What happens to that whole operation, to their mission, to their work.

168
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:21,790
Yeah. I don't know. I think I understand your question correctly, but I think regardless of how things evolve,

169
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:28,180
there will always be a need for funds and resources to go towards individuals to get these procedures.

170
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:35,500
So, you know, even if abortion becomes legal everywhere or the opposite happens,

171
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:43,750
there's going to be a need for advocacy and like actually assisting people in getting these resources.

172
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:49,550
So I don't think there will ever be a. A time when they won't be really needed.

173
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:54,210
Yeah. That's something I meant to highlight earlier, too, talking about this for the history books.

174
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:57,860
Yes. Like these have been in place for decades because even when abortion is legal in places,

175
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:02,180
people do still need access, just like financially and everything, regardless of having to travel.

176
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:12,620
I'm like you mentioned like before it before it was like all over the country and then it decided to focus on Colorado.

177
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:17,090
So if something like this were to happen, like it becomes abortion, if it becomes legal,

178
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:23,930
like the immigrants all over the country, still there will be need. So they could legally maybe expand because now it's legal everywhere.

179
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:28,309
But still, people will need some help to, you know, get these procedures done.

180
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:36,360
So that will be. Yeah. And they're all still functioned like this was essentially just narrowly like Colorado branch and then they split off.

181
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:41,030
But yeah, I guess they could. Yeah. Like we have really free join in there if they wanted to.

182
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:49,129
Yeah. Jumping off of like there's always going to be a need for these funds also is they could also just like

183
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:54,500
reposition their programs and how they address that because I think within their mission statement,

184
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:58,690
there's always going to be a need and like most programs and such,

185
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:06,990
ask for a set amount of time to five years and then just pick up and like Donalds change the face of it or whatever and continue.

186
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:13,130
So I think like of these programs as well.

187
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:22,620
Managerial Quest What managerial steps fit the organization take to recognize?

188
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:32,120
What could they learn from our case that we talked about last week with March of Dimes so that they don't just implode.

189
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:37,459
If something should change there.

190
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:41,780
It was based on an exact industry and economics. We call it an exaggerated shock.

191
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:47,360
My economics colleagues would be very cross with me for using that term here, but I'm going to do it anyway.

192
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:56,870
So. So there was a shock in terms of it was a change based on, you know, intervention.

193
00:19:56,870 --> 00:20:03,760
So the vaccine, it worked. It eradicated the disease and now wasn't there anymore periods of policy change?

194
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:13,190
So if everyone's working on the policy change, what can these organizations be doing to both available and providing what's needed now,

195
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:19,010
but also being future thinking about sort of what is the next step?

196
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,540
Kind of thinking about sort of your next assignment.

197
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:30,580
You're thinking about a five year strategic plan for the what what can I be thinking in terms of all of this, in terms of not just being reactive?

198
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:35,650
No, I was going to say, like having a strategic plan in place.

199
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:41,240
I think when you're I think that, you know, I never say this about.

200
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:51,580
They're coming out. Maybe like the good thing about being in a marshall Fund is that it's such a divisive issue

201
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:57,700
that I think just in the last couple of years we have seen like rage giving so many times,

202
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:04,269
just constantly on the Internet. And so I don't think like when they're building that strategic plan,

203
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:08,980
they need to worry about like people not caring enough about the issue to give to them.

204
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:14,180
And so I think when they're building it, like looking at like this is a path forward if like.

205
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:19,240
Dog stays in place as the law of the land. And this is where we could go.

206
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:26,470
If Roe versus Wade is kind of like now, if Senate and House are held by Democrats.

207
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:32,050
And so kind of having like some tiers like managerial it like looking like

208
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:38,350
this is like this is where we are right now and this is where we're heading. But ensuring that something is in place, that if it switches,

209
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:45,990
which are programing to kind of focus on the most need because I imagine like travel is going to always be important.

210
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:54,240
I think New Mexico and Colorado are the only two in the Southwest that have really a lot of protections for abortion care.

211
00:21:54,250 --> 00:22:03,270
And those are big states. So there's always going to be a need for like traveling either within the state or from Texas or whatever it could be.

212
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:12,459
So I don't know that completely. No, no, I so so within that longer setup, you actually just referred to a specific program, which is great.

213
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:17,640
And so so reframing our programing from we're not doing travel across states now.

214
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:21,220
We're making it easier for people to get to within the state.

215
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:27,820
But what if the revenue goes down? What if out of all of this revenue, you all looked at nine nineties.

216
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:32,900
Now think about those nine nineties revenues go up. Dramatically.

217
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:37,400
All these resources are now available. Policy changes.

218
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:42,390
Our revenue changes. People aren't as. Enraged.

219
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:48,970
That's the term we're using today. And what would happen to all those people on staff?

220
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:55,330
What happens to all those people? Where are they? I mean, again, we're thinking about these organizationally.

221
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,730
There are business specific. What?

222
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:08,510
What, um. What happens? If you just kind of think that over.

223
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:18,709
I think that what you've presented for us is a really great example of just that, which is that we're seeing huge changes in policy.

224
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:24,140
So the nonprofits are the ones in many cases where they're benefiting from it.

225
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:28,970
You know, they're they're they're being able to have large influxes.

226
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:35,630
And I'd be curious to see what the what the revenue sort of looked like prior to the to the change.

227
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:46,960
And, you know. We have to make the assumption that there is a there's a mission oriented desire.

228
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:54,849
But we also have to as an as a as a as sort of as a as a group of future managers or group of future

229
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:58,960
leaders have to think about what are the management and what are those leaders thinking about?

230
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:02,350
How are they thinking about their books? How are they thinking about their accountings?

231
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:14,290
What what are they contending with there? We saw some examples of this a bit in 2018, 2019 into many of the civil rights organizations,

232
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:24,670
the ACLU at large influxes of revenue posts, sort of the Trump election or the the administration.

233
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:32,440
So they were running huge surpluses. But then with those surpluses comes the question of is that does that sustainable?

234
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:35,950
Do we put the money away? Is it going into a rainy day fund?

235
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:44,270
Like where where does that although, you know, is it enough to be able to use it right now to have services available for a year out?

236
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:49,159
But then then what? And what happens to all the people in years?

237
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:53,420
Two, three, four, five, six. Who need to need the assistance.

238
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,259
Excellent. I don't need to go down the rabbit hole,

239
00:24:57,260 --> 00:25:03,460
but I just think you've set up for us a really important question and speaks directly to kind of some of these topics.

240
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:46,690
Thank you and thanks for letting me go. All right.

241
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:57,970
I was out there before. And then we talk about parenthood advocates in Michigan and combating the spread of misinformation through education advocacy.

242
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:09,810
So Planned Parenthood advocates and this again is a501 seat for and that is the advocacy arm of Michigan.

243
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:15,330
And what they want to see for they are tactics.

244
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:21,510
So they're based as a social welfare organization, as a threat by the IRS.

245
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:33,030
And they're responsible for promoting social welfare and furthering the common good, which in the welfare of the people of the community,

246
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:46,460
such as bringing about civic betterment and social improvements, pay and I'm going to be short for the law is going to be harder to pass.

247
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:51,870
So it's a fabulous report. There's also a super political action committee or a PAC,

248
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:59,240
and that allows them to work on all levels of advocacy and activism in Michigan for the breakdown of their structure.

249
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:04,480
They're responsible for its direct lobbying with officials, also grassroots lobbying,

250
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:11,220
the community with contacting representatives about which legislation they support and oppose coming up.

251
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:15,600
And also endorsements in the community as well with candidates around the valley.

252
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:19,530
And lastly, they're responsible for power building as well in the community,

253
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:25,319
addressing issues in Michigan and building the support of aides to recruit and retain

254
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:31,470
volunteers and activists across Michigan to uphold the guise of reproductive rights.

255
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,570
So for the mission of pay and.

256
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:44,760
They are responsible for protecting and enhancing the ability of affiliates to deliver reproductive health care services,

257
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:48,900
affecting policymakers through electoral and not electoral activities.

258
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:56,850
They work in conjunction with the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and Planned Parenthood Action Fund at the national level,

259
00:27:56,850 --> 00:28:02,430
as well as their health center education affiliate Planned Parenthood of Michigan, their partner.

260
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:10,170
Also, they work with supporters and patients at the state level to ensure that reproductive health in Michiganders is protected.

261
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:21,770
Next like. So for the girls and they're responsible for educating communities about the status of reproductive rights and health and justice,

262
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:28,880
multiple ways to social media through door to door canvasing and also through advocacy tirelessly before with local elected officials.

263
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:37,400
They also educate the community about the impact public policy, also conservative decision makers on the status of reproductive rights and health.

264
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:41,060
And they drive action and policies. And it is countable.

265
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:46,609
A woman's health and rights lasting and mobilize voters around elections and

266
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:50,700
build lots of power through meaningful engagement of supporters and audience.

267
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:57,640
So let's sit on the right of the slide. We have the organizational staff structure,

268
00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:07,250
the and and it's a little bit different from a traditional 501c3 because they are that social organization that's focused on advocacy.

269
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:10,280
So they have different titles and roles to the organization.

270
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:18,500
And on the left side of the screen, you can see the second director features, of course, her about her stance on Proposal three.

271
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:22,250
And she says that we want to make sure that our voters are able to access

272
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:26,900
abortion and health care that they've been able to access for nearly 50 years.

273
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:37,280
So it's important to sure that they're. And then with PETA, the biggest initiative that they have is Reproductive Freedom for All Ballot initiative,

274
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:43,610
and that is led by Pam and also the ACLU of Michigan, the Michigan Voices.

275
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:52,219
And for this ballot initiative, it seeks to amend the Michigan State Constitution to permanently and explicitly protect reproductive

276
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:57,680
freedom in Michigan and lead us into protecting abortion access with this God initiative.

277
00:29:58,310 --> 00:30:05,320
It also is important to maintain reproductive freedoms as far as the rights of civil,

278
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:11,570
respectful caregivers and also the right to use and refuse temporary or permanent birth control.

279
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:13,849
Lastly, with this body,

280
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:23,530
you should have support in that it provides the protection against prosecutions of pregnancy outcomes such as miscarriage and looks.

281
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:31,399
A lot of you'll see I featured here proposal three which is the direct link is that it's on the electoral ballot.

282
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:38,660
And just wanted to put that here because coming up, I'll talk about all the misinformation that people are stating is on the ballot.

283
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:42,030
It's actually not on the ballot. So we've all seen the Senate because they voted today.

284
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:53,080
I even got it today. But I just wanted to put that here. So for Michigan Proposal three, it's important to understand that any firms.

285
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:58,879
Every person has the fundamental right to reproductive freedom and ensures that everyone has the

286
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:04,190
right to make decisions without political interference about all matters with this pregnancy,

287
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:12,170
including birth control, abortion, prenatal care, lots of childcare and so other benefits of the system here.

288
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,839
But for the kind of event I wanted to talk about,

289
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:22,160
the misinformation that's being spread about Proposal three and what AM is doing to combat that through educational advocacy.

290
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:31,250
And then of course, also the Instagram where they have a lot of social media posts on combined the advocacy through education, the broader community.

291
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:43,590
Okay. So an organization that has been spreading a lot of information as citizens to support women and children for their Twitter bio,

292
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:45,450
a feature that on the right side of the slide.

293
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:51,780
And it says a coalition to oppose the abortion amendment in Michigan so as to protect the rights of women,

294
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:55,170
children, parents and everyone from this radical proposal.

295
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:58,079
They've been spending a lot of misinformation online,

296
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:03,270
such as through their YouTube channels on their website and also on Twitter and Instagram as well.

297
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:08,639
To have advertisers out there that spread the information about a proposal such as that

298
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:13,950
it takes away parental consent for abortion and that it's too confusing and too extreme.

299
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:17,579
And it really pulls at that sense of fear among the public.

300
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:23,639
And I'm confused when it comes to different organizations that are putting out things that are simply not true,

301
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:27,750
that are not backed up by facts or reputable information out there on the Internet.

302
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:33,360
So other YouTube channels that actually feature one of their video descriptions,

303
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:40,320
that proposal three permanently rewrites the Michigan Constitution with extreme ideas taking away parental control,

304
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:49,710
parental consent for abortions and gender change therapies for minors, and allowing late term abortion until birth and invalidating 41 laws.

305
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:53,249
This amendment is too confusing issue for no proposal three.

306
00:32:53,250 --> 00:33:04,800
So that that's the information that's being spread out there. That's not true and not reputable looks like here's a video on channels you in.

307
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:13,300
The facts about abortion in Michigan. Abortion is legal.

308
00:33:17,997 --> 00:33:21,987
Proposal three permanently rewrites the Constitution with extreme ideas.

309
00:33:22,377 --> 00:33:26,277
It takes away parents rights and gender change to minors.

310
00:33:26,577 --> 00:33:31,287
And the last term abortions, up to the time it puts it invalidates 41 laws.

311
00:33:31,347 --> 00:33:36,827
I won't tell you which ones. It's confusing, extreme and permanently in your constitution.

312
00:33:37,737 --> 00:33:40,767
One proposal. Three to choose.

313
00:33:41,217 --> 00:33:47,747
Yeah. It's kind of like, you know, really shocking. And it is the policy is supportive of.

314
00:33:54,827 --> 00:33:58,817
It is a slap. So for people.

315
00:33:59,597 --> 00:34:04,697
They saw this advertisement and they actually the fact took them a part of the education of the community.

316
00:34:05,057 --> 00:34:13,147
So they had links on their social media and an article from the Detroit Free Press that fact checked that advertisement and

317
00:34:13,157 --> 00:34:22,107
also stated what information about proposal three that is actually true and wanted to highlight what it is and what it is.

318
00:34:22,787 --> 00:34:25,817
So with the article from the Detroit Free Press,

319
00:34:25,817 --> 00:34:32,477
the headline is that Fact had Proposal three would not allow Ginger to change therapy without parental consent.

320
00:34:33,557 --> 00:34:37,456
For this article, they talked to physicians and the skin medicine.

321
00:34:37,457 --> 00:34:45,017
They talked to professors at University of Michigan Law, Michigan State, to talk to legal attorneys and medical experts.

322
00:34:45,317 --> 00:34:47,837
And they came to the conclusion that this claim is false.

323
00:34:48,227 --> 00:34:54,347
That if proposal three passes, it would allow children to undergo genetic change therapy without parental consent.

324
00:34:55,217 --> 00:35:00,977
It's those stories that we just saw that's out there that needs to be the part that needs to be fact checked.

325
00:35:01,277 --> 00:35:03,677
And it's important that people and that's doing that work.

326
00:35:04,217 --> 00:35:12,077
And on the left side of the screen, you'll see a tweet that is posted from the citizens to support Michigan women and children.

327
00:35:12,437 --> 00:35:14,507
And it states at the beginning of the campaign,

328
00:35:14,777 --> 00:35:22,977
the authors of Proposal three admitted it ends parental consent and gives children a limited right to all matters relating to ABC family.

329
00:35:23,507 --> 00:35:30,737
And I was pictured says proposal three gender change their view about you can see and that's false

330
00:35:30,737 --> 00:35:37,787
because of the presidential spread and efforts that we know about proposal three and on the next slide.

331
00:35:38,687 --> 00:35:43,127
Here's just a quick summary and say that from the article it says that Proposal three does not

332
00:35:43,127 --> 00:35:48,317
explicitly state the miners have the right to gender affirming care without parental consent,

333
00:35:49,157 --> 00:35:57,367
and says further on the quote that medical experts say that Proposal three does not touch on gender from the care that requires its involvement.

334
00:35:57,377 --> 00:36:04,427
So, again, that ties back into what's in the proposal and what say to them what's not what it is not touch on what is not in fact.

335
00:36:06,337 --> 00:36:11,617
So wrapping up. So what else has been done to educate voters and the community?

336
00:36:11,977 --> 00:36:17,496
They have put in an endorsement guide for voters so they can be knowledgeable about

337
00:36:17,497 --> 00:36:22,627
what it is they should be voting for and what happens afterwards that people.

338
00:36:23,827 --> 00:36:33,126
And also, they had virtual virtual phone banking sessions where they've been training committee members to be supporters of PPA and

339
00:36:33,127 --> 00:36:40,537
encourage electoral participation and provide educational reproductive justice to serve on the ballot this upcoming election.

340
00:36:42,167 --> 00:36:47,237
And they've also been providing a checklist for voters after voting at the polls,

341
00:36:47,567 --> 00:36:51,887
making sure that voters are informed of what they are supposed to that proposal but they're not supposed to do.

342
00:36:52,247 --> 00:37:00,497
And also canvasing the door to door to educate the community on why Proposal three is such a big to vote yes on.

343
00:37:01,857 --> 00:37:08,267
And that means presentations. So for the discussion, Amadeus appeared.

344
00:37:08,607 --> 00:37:14,217
Its aim was to jump into the first one. Has anyone seen any false information about the puzzle?

345
00:37:14,217 --> 00:37:18,147
Three thread online and advertisements are heard in conversation.

346
00:37:18,537 --> 00:37:21,756
And have you noticed any trends of themes above the messaging?

347
00:37:21,757 --> 00:37:23,637
That's well for misinformation.

348
00:37:30,227 --> 00:37:37,397
I can speak to the fact that I've got an insane amount of advertising for the organization you spoke to against Prop three.

349
00:37:37,877 --> 00:37:42,757
And I have to say, I thought there were far, even though the arguments were insane.

350
00:37:42,857 --> 00:37:48,857
I think that the marketing strategy is far more effective than I think the.

351
00:37:48,977 --> 00:37:53,317
Yes, yes. I don't know. I cheat. I had I had a conversation with someone else.

352
00:37:53,317 --> 00:37:56,836
So so I think my perspective is a little twisted because I live within Washington County and I

353
00:37:56,837 --> 00:38:01,246
think they're looking at our roads and wondering if they just didn't send us like at our address,

354
00:38:01,247 --> 00:38:09,137
more of the no doubt we've been using it statewide.

355
00:38:09,137 --> 00:38:12,917
It's been very minimal that I've been reading about this.

356
00:38:13,427 --> 00:38:18,517
It's not I was hoping that the counties that are okay or then in that case I,

357
00:38:19,187 --> 00:38:25,157
I can say it's like Oakland County, for example, has been all over those societies from that organization.

358
00:38:25,457 --> 00:38:29,567
Yeah, I think there's, I think, I don't know if it's like only, you know, planned,

359
00:38:29,567 --> 00:38:34,786
like only this organization to blame or like, you know, that there's really late on messaging.

360
00:38:34,787 --> 00:38:40,397
I feel like I got stuff months before from the other side and then, you know, now with like the signs,

361
00:38:40,397 --> 00:38:48,557
the Prop three signs that they only started having those maps a couple of weeks ago, like unless you had like some, you know, different connections.

362
00:38:48,887 --> 00:38:53,177
So I was really disappointed on just their messages and their their how late they were talking.

363
00:38:54,677 --> 00:39:04,347
Just. This is more of a question but it seems like all the people in the ad for.

364
00:39:05,367 --> 00:39:09,297
Too confusing, too extreme, which is one of the funniest things I've seen in a long time.

365
00:39:10,797 --> 00:39:16,767
It's all up in the side of the road. We were laughing and providing the best time, but obviously serious trouble.

366
00:39:17,687 --> 00:39:23,467
But it looks like you're marketing it to our quiet people because like all the people, the photos were all blown.

367
00:39:24,227 --> 00:39:27,987
Oh, yeah. Obviously they have a target population, so.

368
00:39:29,157 --> 00:39:33,447
I guess the trend or theme, I don't know. That's just what I see.

369
00:39:33,627 --> 00:39:39,087
Or if that's just I haven't seen enough images to catch in the ad.

370
00:39:39,387 --> 00:39:46,287
The video. Did you catch how they referred to the proposal and to the to the Constitution and Michigan.

371
00:39:47,007 --> 00:39:51,507
Whose constitution is it? Not ours.

372
00:39:51,567 --> 00:39:55,797
Yours. Your Constitution. Your family's.

373
00:39:55,827 --> 00:40:02,237
Your your that outside. So back to your question.

374
00:40:02,247 --> 00:40:05,807
My next follow up would be, you know, maybe, you know, you know,

375
00:40:05,937 --> 00:40:10,977
this speaks to what we were talking about last week in our discussion about marketing, communication, branding, all that,

376
00:40:11,577 --> 00:40:18,446
you know, how effective is it if it feels like it's not from the community because not reflective of

377
00:40:18,447 --> 00:40:24,657
the people who actually live there or from their sense of feel over there from the outside.

378
00:40:26,277 --> 00:40:30,567
Ali, I just had a different reaction to that because I heard the rumors also.

379
00:40:30,567 --> 00:40:34,587
But I, I felt like that was to frame it as like.

380
00:40:35,827 --> 00:40:39,037
So the Democrats in charge are the other.

381
00:40:39,157 --> 00:40:44,377
It's it's them versus you. They're going to take away your rights rather than.

382
00:40:44,407 --> 00:40:49,367
Are you saying that it indicates that the organization is from outside of the community?

383
00:40:49,387 --> 00:40:51,357
Demanded the man. I'd be furious.

384
00:40:51,367 --> 00:40:57,127
So that's that's a that's a it's an intentional branding decision or a digital marketing decision that an organization may make.

385
00:40:58,387 --> 00:41:05,367
A because they just didn't think about it or B, because they had done careful study to know that best to look like we're,

386
00:41:05,747 --> 00:41:12,487
you know, an authoritative voice from the outside versus, you know, making it seem like it's one side versus the other side.

387
00:41:12,497 --> 00:41:17,977
You know, we're the ones who are externally sort of objectively reviewing this.

388
00:41:19,677 --> 00:41:27,996
That is a stylistic question. And yeah, I was going to say so this is actually like Tutor Dixon's been coming to Dearborn lately,

389
00:41:27,997 --> 00:41:35,917
and a lot of people are welcoming her and she's kind of like highlighting a lot of this stuff because like,

390
00:41:37,177 --> 00:41:42,757
like and so I guess a lot of religious, like from a religious standpoint, there's like some limitations and abortion.

391
00:41:43,237 --> 00:41:49,237
And so she's like, like touching on that a lot to kind of like get people to listen to her.

392
00:41:49,237 --> 00:41:55,117
And she's been spending it like spreading a lot of false narratives of it that people a lot of people are just.

393
00:41:56,887 --> 00:42:02,497
I think believing what just makes it really hard to like you can try to combat that at all.

394
00:42:02,677 --> 00:42:07,567
But she's just been saying with the gender things she's been talking about and also been saying like all your taking,

395
00:42:07,567 --> 00:42:11,647
they're like taking away your religious rights and they're not giving you this.

396
00:42:11,657 --> 00:42:18,966
Like she said something like, oh, they're allowing other people to send for you.

397
00:42:18,967 --> 00:42:22,416
And I'm just like, I know. It's just like crazy things like that.

398
00:42:22,417 --> 00:42:29,577
And then a lot of people, because religious beliefs are so important for a lot of people, they're kind of just like, take it at face value.

399
00:42:29,597 --> 00:42:36,967
They listen to her and they just will probably end up voting no and will probably end up voting for her, which is just so hard.

400
00:42:37,187 --> 00:42:43,027
It's just a lot of misinformation is getting spread on this and like with everything in Dearborn right now.

401
00:42:43,027 --> 00:42:52,917
So it's not the. I was going to actually say something similar that I feel like from my background was like a nation and also access.

402
00:42:53,307 --> 00:42:55,886
So like if I were to watch the ads from before,

403
00:42:55,887 --> 00:43:02,787
like I was kind of thinking of like people in my church because I feel like they would have voted no for like poverty just based off of that,

404
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:08,307
like how it was presented. First of all, if this is like your first language, you're not going to read the proposal all the way.

405
00:43:08,727 --> 00:43:11,727
And it's almost as if you were going to take it and believe it.

406
00:43:12,117 --> 00:43:16,317
And then not like no one is reading on ballots like your second question. No one's reading the whole proposal.

407
00:43:16,527 --> 00:43:22,937
No one is reading the whole policy. No one is looking up. And it's like every single thing that they ever voted on, ever.

408
00:43:22,947 --> 00:43:29,397
Like no one's like that. So I feel like ads are really where people get like how they feel about something.

409
00:43:29,397 --> 00:43:33,717
So some kind of it kind of sounds like what you were saying that my friend was so late to the game.

410
00:43:33,987 --> 00:43:39,597
So I still have not received like a text or anything over this whole time, but I've received other things.

411
00:43:39,807 --> 00:43:47,006
Like I said, I want to go back to this presentation for a second because I think some of this

412
00:43:47,007 --> 00:43:51,927
is a little bit linked to the question I was setting up at the end there because.

413
00:43:53,957 --> 00:44:01,007
To a certain extent, these organizations are the ones you see that are either advocating or kind of.

414
00:44:02,337 --> 00:44:07,916
Pushing towards the policy changes they can't advocate on behalf of particular candidates.

415
00:44:07,917 --> 00:44:11,337
But when it comes to change in policy, that's where it is.

416
00:44:11,727 --> 00:44:16,257
Obviously, David's presentation, in your presentation, you're focusing on the C forearm.

417
00:44:16,797 --> 00:44:18,807
Planned Parenthood has its own C three arm.

418
00:44:18,807 --> 00:44:24,837
So the C three obviously can't directly lobby, but it certainly can be involved in thinking about it, considering.

419
00:44:25,427 --> 00:44:35,397
So to go back to my other question for 48, 49 years, where Roe was the policy of the United States,

420
00:44:36,117 --> 00:44:42,417
these other organizations existed with the sort of focus of, you know,

421
00:44:42,597 --> 00:44:48,327
advocating against the right to life of Michigan is a is a very well-known organization of Michigan that for many,

422
00:44:48,327 --> 00:44:57,147
many years was very much aligned with efforts to curb and in other ways sort of change policy here.

423
00:44:58,017 --> 00:45:03,567
So my question to all of you, just again, to bring this back to the organizational lens is sort of.

424
00:45:05,487 --> 00:45:10,767
With a policy not being in place to create that emergency, so to speak,

425
00:45:12,057 --> 00:45:20,007
where the organizations continue to have capacity so that when the emergency happens, they're ready to go.

426
00:45:20,907 --> 00:45:26,817
Because what I'm hearing some of you say is kind of where was the communication on this?

427
00:45:27,357 --> 00:45:30,947
And then I would organizationally start to ask, okay, what was their plan?

428
00:45:30,957 --> 00:45:38,937
What was their strategic plan? You know, what was the resource that was on standby to be ready to go if something were to change?

429
00:45:39,627 --> 00:45:45,356
And that's this is again, I'm as many things I say, I'm not making a judgment or saying right or wrong and posing.

430
00:45:45,357 --> 00:45:50,217
If you think about, you know, if you're evaluating organizations and kind of how they make decisions,

431
00:45:50,967 --> 00:45:57,807
where could the organization start to do either different or similar, similar or, you know, why?

432
00:45:57,807 --> 00:46:05,097
Why is one organization seemingly like, you know, like that they were they were out there with ads and ready to go.

433
00:46:05,997 --> 00:46:09,917
Yeah, I think it takes a lot less information to, like,

434
00:46:09,927 --> 00:46:16,227
just inform someone or misinform someone than it does to inform someone and in fact, or what have you.

435
00:46:16,797 --> 00:46:21,596
And so that's like the first thing is like an organization like this,

436
00:46:21,597 --> 00:46:28,077
a rogue one can come in and do this with little and destroy everything because we only one negative thing for us to like.

437
00:46:28,077 --> 00:46:34,916
I think it's just a psychological thing, but I think feel like for a lot of organizations it's like ultimately just like us as humans, like it's who,

438
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:40,137
you know, it's like the network you build and you have like maybe you don't have the capacity,

439
00:46:40,137 --> 00:46:45,627
but you know someone who does have the capacity for the colony. And so Planned Parenthood, maybe.

440
00:46:46,577 --> 00:46:50,817
Should have. Maybe there's other organizations that they've siloed themselves off of.

441
00:46:50,837 --> 00:46:58,517
I don't know. I'm not like I'm not the consultant, but just like who have they over these years?

442
00:46:58,517 --> 00:47:02,007
What have they done with your time? All the networks should be embarrassed.

443
00:47:02,057 --> 00:47:11,357
Like you can't. You can't live in Michigan and not be thinking about this or in the United States about things, about abortion that you like.

444
00:47:11,837 --> 00:47:15,327
I don't remember the time in my life without having to think about.

445
00:47:17,427 --> 00:47:20,817
Well, I think just what's surprising about this to me, too, is like it's Planned Parenthood,

446
00:47:20,817 --> 00:47:24,626
like they're well known and like we've known this is all coming for months.

447
00:47:24,627 --> 00:47:30,147
So like they should have a volunteer base at this point, like just on standby period, given the nature of the work that they do.

448
00:47:30,147 --> 00:47:35,747
But especially in this year, like it's shocking that like that just cause they really did not get it together to organize, volunteer.

449
00:47:35,877 --> 00:47:38,997
I'm sure they had people that were willing and ready to go to do. It's just tech speaking.

450
00:47:39,357 --> 00:47:43,137
It's it's easy to sign up to do that. So I don't know.

451
00:47:43,167 --> 00:47:49,587
That's not really like an answer answer, but it's like but but I want you to you made the comment.

452
00:47:49,587 --> 00:47:54,837
You're not their consultant, but I want you to all talk. And that's okay. I mean, in fact.

453
00:47:54,837 --> 00:47:59,097
Yes, but I want you to all kind of put yourself in that role for a second. What would you do?

454
00:47:59,217 --> 00:48:07,286
You know, you're if you're there with them, if you're sitting there with them and you're no longer you live or future Christiana Refuge or, you know,

455
00:48:07,287 --> 00:48:18,387
like you're you're, you know, a year ago and you can see this coming right where where is what's the strategic planning that needs to be happening?

456
00:48:18,957 --> 00:48:25,536
That it's not a surprise all of a sudden? Christina, you know, you kind of like talked about this a little bit,

457
00:48:25,537 --> 00:48:31,557
the policy for the how like Republicans have been working for years and years and years to like slowly unravel girl.

458
00:48:31,827 --> 00:48:35,547
And I think on the democratic side it's been more reactive.

459
00:48:36,057 --> 00:48:44,667
Uh, so like to me, I think that something that I could have done or like make volunteer or like use their

460
00:48:45,117 --> 00:48:49,297
staff to like house different teams and like have volunteers on different teams.

461
00:48:49,297 --> 00:48:55,377
So like we have one team was actually working on like what's going on right now like in Michigan courts or whatever the case may be.

462
00:48:55,647 --> 00:49:01,136
But then we have another team working on like, like I think one if rule gets overturned,

463
00:49:01,137 --> 00:49:04,677
one, it really doesn't get over time like just having different options on the table,

464
00:49:04,687 --> 00:49:08,487
like different teams working like, um, I guess like different,

465
00:49:08,847 --> 00:49:14,807
different options would make the most sense to me cause this has definitely been unraveling over time.

466
00:49:14,877 --> 00:49:20,787
I think. Like, they've just used all of their resources to like Prop three and stuff, which is good,

467
00:49:21,207 --> 00:49:29,037
but I think it would have helped earlier on to like in Florida, for example, like with the 15 week abortion ban,

468
00:49:29,667 --> 00:49:36,777
I was with my friend at the time and like we just did everything to like focus on that abortion ban specifically and

469
00:49:36,777 --> 00:49:42,987
there was no other team to like see if there was another policy that we can do are like protecting contraceptives,

470
00:49:42,987 --> 00:49:45,117
like there was no other team focusing on alternatives.

471
00:49:45,447 --> 00:49:52,407
So I think like you have to have a strategic plan that takes into account having a base to support.

472
00:49:58,197 --> 00:49:59,947
I think partnerships are really important.

473
00:50:00,487 --> 00:50:09,816
And that's and I've seen a lot of I have probably seen more things about vote yes on all three more than I have like the focus on number three,

474
00:50:09,817 --> 00:50:14,947
like oh yes. And all three of these events. And I'm just like, Oh yes, of course I'm transparent.

475
00:50:15,457 --> 00:50:22,717
And I think that is a really good place that those organizations that are pushing that are really good place for.

476
00:50:24,447 --> 00:50:31,737
Planned Parenthood to make a connection, make partnership, to say like, hey, you are doing that.

477
00:50:31,827 --> 00:50:34,907
We have a mutual interest here. We we want the same thing.

478
00:50:34,937 --> 00:50:39,447
And like, maybe Planned Parenthood doesn't push for and doesn't want it to, if that's not wheelhouse.

479
00:50:39,457 --> 00:50:43,707
But there's definitely a that could be like shared finance and marketing.

480
00:50:44,647 --> 00:50:53,787
To get proposal three passed. That's when, like every one of these projects, I feel like going back to her time,

481
00:50:53,947 --> 00:51:00,607
like Republicans are very good about being in sync on things and having a solid message.

482
00:51:01,467 --> 00:51:06,147
If Democrats are really bad at it and they're generally not very good at like

483
00:51:06,337 --> 00:51:10,297
pulling organizations together in the way that Republicans have been doing,

484
00:51:10,297 --> 00:51:20,437
I think it's a lot more. But if I was in this position, I would be pushing a lot more partnerships between organizations to make that happen,

485
00:51:21,217 --> 00:51:24,907
because I think that's the only way that things will get done in.

486
00:51:26,577 --> 00:51:31,317
So I know today is an election day and we're all very much in the political mindset.

487
00:51:31,497 --> 00:51:36,867
So I want to just kind of keep us keep bringing you back as you're thinking about this again to the organizations

488
00:51:36,867 --> 00:51:44,477
themselves and encourage all of us to sort of keep thinking about this in terms of those organizational decisions,

489
00:51:44,487 --> 00:51:48,476
absent the politics themselves, what those decisions are.

490
00:51:48,477 --> 00:51:50,157
And I'll make great points about it.

491
00:51:50,607 --> 00:52:00,477
I keep thinking about how we apply this back to the organization and what it does, what steps it takes, what strategic goals it sets.

492
00:52:00,477 --> 00:52:02,817
But then also, how is it implementing those goals?

493
00:52:03,477 --> 00:52:08,457
You kind of if you if you'll start to see it probably when you work through that your third assignment.

494
00:52:08,817 --> 00:52:12,567
It's a process that that I'm hoping you're starting to see in terms of the way

495
00:52:12,567 --> 00:52:16,077
that the assignments our course are structured is you've done the background,

496
00:52:16,077 --> 00:52:21,537
were proposing a new program and kind of thinking forward a bit to sort of assess the landscape.

497
00:52:22,077 --> 00:52:26,407
Your next step is going to be to propose a strategic plan for a five year period.

498
00:52:27,117 --> 00:52:31,496
But in proposing that strategic plan, what I'm hoping you'll be sort of in I think these two presentations,

499
00:52:31,497 --> 00:52:34,887
there are excellent examples of it thinking about,

500
00:52:34,977 --> 00:52:42,447
okay, what am I going to do as an organization to be anticipating what happens next so that we're not just reacting?

501
00:52:42,807 --> 00:52:48,267
I heard a few times the comment Republicans, you know, they have an organized or they have what have you.

502
00:52:49,227 --> 00:52:53,517
They're not a they're not an entity. They're they're a collection of organizations.

503
00:52:53,637 --> 00:52:58,016
So within those organizations, so let's take, for example, regulation of Michigan.

504
00:52:58,017 --> 00:53:04,317
You know, what the right to life of Michigan do in a period of time to set strategic goals,

505
00:53:04,317 --> 00:53:10,017
to have resources available, to be sort of taking action in a certain way.

506
00:53:11,307 --> 00:53:15,477
What did Planned Parenthood do? Sometimes it's because the resources aren't there.

507
00:53:16,227 --> 00:53:19,647
But then it also begs the question of if the resources aren't there.

508
00:53:19,917 --> 00:53:28,977
We have to be still thinking about what's next. So I appreciate both of today's presentations because I think they're timely and

509
00:53:29,097 --> 00:53:35,787
they're bringing up a very important perspective in terms of the political part.

510
00:53:35,787 --> 00:53:42,686
But I am an advocate and I also want to encourage everyone to leverage that opportunity

511
00:53:42,687 --> 00:53:47,607
to think about these organizations and sort of where they sit inside of this story.

512
00:53:47,817 --> 00:53:51,327
Because many of them, as you've seen now for AP,

513
00:53:51,927 --> 00:53:59,697
are right in the middle of all this and having to contend with policy changes to figure out what to do and how to respond.

514
00:54:01,207 --> 00:54:11,027
So I think it's really great. I think what I just threw out there was another big ally.

515
00:54:11,587 --> 00:54:15,357
And I'm not this is not me trying to I try to patronize it.

516
00:54:15,357 --> 00:54:19,637
I'm just trying to kind of push us to kind of keep thinking about this through that organization.

517
00:54:19,657 --> 00:54:28,857
Let's go ahead. Was there an article that you had a story early on about like flexibility and adaptability as traits that you see?

518
00:54:30,907 --> 00:54:38,517
Yeah, well, that so this is part of it. Many of the things I keep coming back to that idea of sort of what happens when the funding shifts.

519
00:54:39,117 --> 00:54:49,037
If I build my school operation, the old stable, it means that so, so, so structured in one direction.

520
00:54:49,907 --> 00:54:54,087
Then something changes. I don't have the capacity to accomplish it.

521
00:54:54,837 --> 00:54:58,617
You know, those are the questions that become a better management.

522
00:54:58,917 --> 00:55:05,097
Is it better to have like a gigantic staff in order to run it or better to hold the dollars in reserve and say,

523
00:55:05,097 --> 00:55:10,977
you know what, we're keeping this for a different strategic goal if we don't have to start on it right now.

524
00:55:11,277 --> 00:55:20,457
But rather than just continue to expand and continue to have more and more and more, we have to keep our sort of vision toward where are we going?

525
00:55:20,797 --> 00:55:26,307
And is our vision starting to sort of drift? You know, do we have the ability to pivot?

526
00:55:27,057 --> 00:55:35,817
What can we do if something should go wrong? You saw it quite a bit at the beginning of October of many of the nonprofits just laid everybody off.

527
00:55:37,467 --> 00:55:41,097
Because they didn't have the dollars. The dollars weren't there. They weren't prepared for that.

528
00:55:41,517 --> 00:55:47,037
They didn't like that. They weren't prepared to just change, you know, immediately and flip something different.

529
00:55:49,347 --> 00:55:59,187
Christiana Yeah. I think it's just like challenging for me to think of the question that you're asking in the perspective of the sea for me,

530
00:55:59,577 --> 00:56:04,827
because they are like a political art, so they mostly do like advocacy and like lobbying and stuff like that.

531
00:56:04,827 --> 00:56:11,647
So it's kind of hard for me to think about like what their strategic plan would be outside of policies changing.

532
00:56:12,027 --> 00:56:15,057
So it's like hard to answer those questions. Sure. So I would.

533
00:56:15,177 --> 00:56:18,837
So the flip side of that would be what is the C three doing in the meantime?

534
00:56:19,257 --> 00:56:26,967
So if the Sea four is the activator for the policy advocacy because the Sea three can what is the sea three are doing in the interim.

535
00:56:27,627 --> 00:56:32,936
Right. So that, you know, they're out there gathering volunteers.

536
00:56:32,937 --> 00:56:36,147
So when the sea floor turns on, the volunteers are there.

537
00:56:36,267 --> 00:56:40,557
It's not wait, where are they going to be? How are we going? You know, they're ready.

538
00:56:41,967 --> 00:56:45,537
So that's I mean, that's what what else we think. What else could the Sea three be doing?

539
00:56:48,667 --> 00:56:51,967
I'm talking a lot today. I don't want you all to think I'm telling you the answer.

540
00:56:52,567 --> 00:56:55,597
Go ahead. Just like they could be doing a lot more education.

541
00:56:55,747 --> 00:57:05,257
Sure, sure. And so, you know, we've made the comment, Christiane, you made a great point, which is, you know, real easy to see.

542
00:57:05,257 --> 00:57:13,907
No, no is really easy. But if everybody knows what this is and we don't know yet, we'll see tomorrow, hopefully what the outcome is on all of that.

543
00:57:14,967 --> 00:57:18,337
But everybody knows a certain way.

544
00:57:18,547 --> 00:57:24,757
And are these kinds of campaigns is effective? Okay.

545
00:57:26,197 --> 00:57:30,936
2 minutes, right? I said. 2 minutes. 35.

546
00:57:30,937 --> 00:57:40,764
21. They will come back to next you.

547
00:57:48,926 --> 00:57:55,976
All right. I'm going to start. I think we've had a really great lead in to our.

548
00:57:56,006 --> 00:58:06,356
Oh, yeah. So today's topic related to lobbying, I think our representatives are too excellent being able to really help to set the stage.

549
00:58:06,856 --> 00:58:10,466
And I, I was talking a little, a little bit here in the break. I again,

550
00:58:10,466 --> 00:58:16,916
I just want to kind of come back and sort of reiterate the point that I appreciate everyone kind of giving a

551
00:58:16,916 --> 00:58:23,695
thought to its strategic planning concept and sort of thinking with these cases that we're talking about,

552
00:58:23,696 --> 00:58:28,556
these current events or cases what have you, thinking about it from that organizational lens of what?

553
00:58:28,556 --> 00:58:31,736
Why does an organization make a decision that makes what?

554
00:58:31,886 --> 00:58:36,486
What steps, how many steps ahead is it planning? All right.

555
00:58:36,546 --> 00:58:42,246
So maybe we talked a bit about it today and probably the governmental policy.

556
00:58:42,836 --> 00:58:55,236
Uh, you know, I think the effect of government does, uh, and the idea is providing policymakers with relevant information to reduce uncertainty.

557
00:58:56,016 --> 00:59:01,656
And uncertainty is a concept that we see quite a bit in lobbying, but also in health care organizations.

558
00:59:02,166 --> 00:59:05,826
We talk about how, especially last week in terms of marketing, communication,

559
00:59:06,096 --> 00:59:11,046
uncertainty is something that we have to always contend with in messaging related to health care.

560
00:59:11,676 --> 00:59:19,416
But at the end of the day, our goal with lobbying is to influence government action either through a written or oral communication.

561
00:59:21,116 --> 00:59:29,126
So here I give you four criteria. Lobbying related to government decision making intended to influence public policy.

562
00:59:29,216 --> 00:59:35,666
And we started with government decision making. We might be lobbying associated with what bill we might want to have passed or what

563
00:59:35,666 --> 00:59:41,616
legislation we might want to see changed lobbying for influencing a public policy.

564
00:59:41,646 --> 00:59:43,975
So on the break, we were talking about, you know,

565
00:59:43,976 --> 00:59:49,286
what just sort of building on what we're just talking about, like what the what the C-3 and you know,

566
00:59:49,736 --> 00:59:54,115
what is it doing to influence public policy in the interim when there's not an

567
00:59:54,116 --> 00:59:58,826
actual question on the ballot and there's not an actual candidate standing abroad?

568
01:00:00,266 --> 01:00:04,526
Um, lobbying is practiced by an intermediary.

569
01:00:04,766 --> 01:00:10,736
So someone who is linking citizens with policy makers or interest groups.

570
01:00:11,316 --> 01:00:18,055
Uh, and, and the idea here again, that lobbying is an act of communication, that ultimately we're communicating.

571
01:00:18,056 --> 01:00:21,626
And that doesn't mean we're communicating just through a no on three type sign.

572
01:00:22,136 --> 01:00:29,275
We might be communicating through education, we might be communicating through, um, focus groups,

573
01:00:29,276 --> 01:00:35,426
we might be communicating through town halls, we might be communicating through any type of way to interface to get.

574
01:00:36,866 --> 01:00:41,066
So when we think about lobbying, our first step in the process is to gain access.

575
01:00:41,816 --> 01:00:47,456
This is the part that I think is is really critical to consider here, which is the relationship piece.

576
01:00:48,056 --> 01:00:51,446
We have a relationship with someone. We can't just disappear.

577
01:00:51,926 --> 01:00:56,276
It's not. Hi. Nice to see you. I need your vote on this today.

578
01:00:56,516 --> 01:00:59,126
Bye bye. I'll see you in 20 years when I need you again.

579
01:00:59,786 --> 01:01:09,806
So organizations specifically see threes, maintain very, very good relationships with those who have power to make change in policy.

580
01:01:10,676 --> 01:01:14,456
So the University of Michigan, for example, maintains an Office of Government Relations.

581
01:01:15,026 --> 01:01:22,286
This office is responsible for being in touch with legislators so that when something comes up, it's against the interests of the organization.

582
01:01:22,586 --> 01:01:28,946
It's not just going to Lansing tomorrow to go, Oh, my goodness, I never heard of this before and I haven't talked to anyone lately.

583
01:01:29,366 --> 01:01:33,696
There are they have the people that they know are making the calls.

584
01:01:33,716 --> 01:01:40,106
They're getting in touch with their legislators that they're working with and that there's a process there to interface together.

585
01:01:41,506 --> 01:01:44,596
And so the idea then is that we're gaining access,

586
01:01:44,746 --> 01:01:52,636
sharing that that groups view on an issue with the legislator and then influencing a legislator in the group's favor is the ultimate goal.

587
01:01:54,096 --> 01:01:59,736
So we have direct lobbying for direct communication between an interest group and a legislator.

588
01:01:59,736 --> 01:02:05,166
You might see this when you have an organization, might go in and have a meeting with with members.

589
01:02:05,176 --> 01:02:12,686
So for example, JD, RF for type one diabetes research, they traditionally had what they called a children's Congress.

590
01:02:12,696 --> 01:02:18,996
They would send children and their families to Washington every year, every few years.

591
01:02:19,656 --> 01:02:24,065
And they were doing that because they had relationships with the committee chairs and the

592
01:02:24,066 --> 01:02:29,856
ranking member of the subcommittee that was responsible for funding diabetes research.

593
01:02:30,396 --> 01:02:35,706
So they were there every few years to to testify at a subcommittee hearing.

594
01:02:36,486 --> 01:02:39,606
Was there a piece of legislation that was sitting on the floor?

595
01:02:39,786 --> 01:02:48,755
Not necessarily. But they were there to be in touch, to be continuously communicating about this so that as legislation was considered,

596
01:02:48,756 --> 01:02:54,906
either a pieces of this would get into the legislation or B, once the legislation was up,

597
01:02:55,206 --> 01:02:57,486
they would have the relationships to be able to advocate for it.

598
01:02:58,386 --> 01:03:06,426
So they're providing legislators with background information, influencing on how members will work through a specific bill, etc.

599
01:03:08,886 --> 01:03:11,946
We've talked today quite a bit about grassroots lobbying.

600
01:03:12,276 --> 01:03:21,456
So lobbying aimed at mobilizing citizenry so that their voices will be listened to by legislators and or government officers.

601
01:03:21,576 --> 01:03:27,335
So Coleman says in this article, I'm kind of sharing the point here that there are two purposes.

602
01:03:27,336 --> 01:03:31,086
We're urging the public to share the group's view on an issue.

603
01:03:31,656 --> 01:03:43,236
And the other piece is pressuring policymakers to support the interest groups view on an issue by encouraging those citizens to contact policymakers.

604
01:03:43,716 --> 01:03:52,295
So as Liz and I were talking in the break about sort of what was the strategic plan of Planned Parenthood for one step in

605
01:03:52,296 --> 01:04:00,786
their strategic plan must have been that they had recognized that there might be a change in policy with regards to Roe.

606
01:04:01,086 --> 01:04:04,106
And they were honest, you know, like, boom.

607
01:04:04,386 --> 01:04:07,656
They were ready to go with a ballot campaign initiative.

608
01:04:08,046 --> 01:04:14,136
And within a month and a half or so, almost a million signatures were collected and on the ballot.

609
01:04:14,886 --> 01:04:19,446
The next question then is what was their strategic plan after that?

610
01:04:19,656 --> 01:04:24,695
After we get it on the ballot, did all the resources get used up to collect the signatures?

611
01:04:24,696 --> 01:04:30,846
And, you know, there wasn't enough to think through kind of the next objective, which is OC on the ballot success.

612
01:04:30,876 --> 01:04:36,335
Now, what do we do in August when all these signs go up and all of this information starts coming out?

613
01:04:36,336 --> 01:04:44,886
That's not necessarily connected to what we're looking to do. So that grassroots lobbying piece is a critical part to the lobbying process.

614
01:04:47,046 --> 01:04:53,376
We have electoral lobbying. So this is lobbying designed to change policy by influencing elections.

615
01:04:53,736 --> 01:04:59,376
So it's making contributions to candidates, building good relationships with candidates.

616
01:05:00,286 --> 01:05:06,906
Was the number one senator in the United States who got talked about last year all those negotiations about policy.

617
01:05:08,036 --> 01:05:11,096
Young man, Joe Manchin from West Virginia.

618
01:05:12,356 --> 01:05:17,516
How many non-profits do you suppose were in touch with Joe Manchin from West Virginia?

619
01:05:21,466 --> 01:05:24,736
I don't have enough. A lot. A lot.

620
01:05:26,116 --> 01:05:33,326
A lot of. What do you think was their strategy perhaps in being in touch with Joe Manchin from West Virginia?

621
01:05:35,706 --> 01:05:42,576
My name. Okay. One. What do you. What else do you think? If they can get the outlier that they can get everyone to.

622
01:05:42,876 --> 01:05:47,946
And what do you think their strategy was with him? Who do you think was originally from different?

623
01:05:48,006 --> 01:05:50,706
Who do you think was most successful at having his ear?

624
01:05:53,566 --> 01:06:03,136
Which organizations that you had a preexisting interest in preexisting interest or or and a relationship.

625
01:06:04,016 --> 01:06:10,136
So if you're Joe Manchin and now you're in the spotlight and everybody's aimed at you in terms of saying you're the vote.

626
01:06:12,116 --> 01:06:21,506
Probably likely if we were to dig into it a bit more, that those organizations that had been in touch with him, that had relationships with him,

627
01:06:21,866 --> 01:06:27,676
that had been talking with him, those were the ones that maybe had his ear because there was a trust that had been built up.

628
01:06:27,686 --> 01:06:31,766
It was more of a, Hey, we've been in touch, we've been talking to you,

629
01:06:32,336 --> 01:06:37,826
not necessarily just about giving to their campaign, but we've been interfacing together.

630
01:06:38,156 --> 01:06:46,636
So let's talk about what's going on right now. So we saw this in 2008 quite a bit with the with TARP.

631
01:06:47,416 --> 01:06:50,746
So ancient history 28. Way back in time.

632
01:06:51,136 --> 01:07:00,826
Um, the, at the time of the market crash, um, the banks kind of had their,

633
01:07:00,826 --> 01:07:07,216
their bill that was put together for before what was colloquially at the time of their bailout, you know, to rescue the banks.

634
01:07:07,846 --> 01:07:16,876
And one of the very famous stories about this was that much of the legislation was crafted by the lobbyists who worked for Bank of America,

635
01:07:16,876 --> 01:07:20,026
Lehman Brothers, etc., because they had the relationships.

636
01:07:20,146 --> 01:07:24,616
They were in there. They were talking to the members prior to all of this.

637
01:07:25,006 --> 01:07:29,596
And they were they were there when the emergency happened. And this moment came to be.

638
01:07:29,866 --> 01:07:33,106
That's who those people call, because they're not thinking experts.

639
01:07:33,346 --> 01:07:37,816
These policymakers kind of think you have like an overly encyclopedic understanding of that.

640
01:07:37,816 --> 01:07:41,636
So they they those were the people they knew to call. So in.

641
01:07:42,906 --> 01:07:45,596
What you can do. I don't know what's going on. All right.

642
01:07:45,606 --> 01:07:50,616
Well, I was just thinking, I guess when I said money, I was thinking more like the subject of like.

643
01:07:51,596 --> 01:07:55,666
Is it true that you the do we think relationships trump like funding to the campaigns

644
01:07:55,676 --> 01:07:59,516
like I feel like they're going to listen to you over funded for donating money.

645
01:08:00,296 --> 01:08:04,496
So I think I would ask everyone here to weigh in on that.

646
01:08:04,526 --> 01:08:07,966
I don't know that there's an answer. I would I'd be curious. But what do we think?

647
01:08:07,976 --> 01:08:11,206
What do we think? Relationships are the money.

648
01:08:13,936 --> 01:08:19,036
Or is the relationship gotten for the money? It's not insane.

649
01:08:23,226 --> 01:08:29,886
So maybe we could say that the money is what buys you in to have the access, so to speak.

650
01:08:30,816 --> 01:08:35,436
But at the end of the day, we also have to consider what's the information that we're presenting.

651
01:08:36,786 --> 01:08:44,766
So if I have access to you, but I'm presenting information that maybe is either against your interests or doesn't seem to resonate.

652
01:08:46,176 --> 01:08:49,386
You know, all that contribution didn't really get me much.

653
01:08:50,016 --> 01:08:57,546
And I was going to say personal experience. Like I lobbied basically for like years before starting grad schools like this is just nostalgic for me.

654
01:08:57,786 --> 01:08:58,716
But what would happen?

655
01:08:58,716 --> 01:09:05,246
Because I would do a lot of like the individual I forgot, like what you classify that is lobbying, like just being direct with members of Congress.

656
01:09:05,256 --> 01:09:11,556
And whenever I met with a member who they didn't have an interest like, unlike what I was talking about,

657
01:09:11,556 --> 01:09:15,606
regardless of how it was like I was representing like really strong and powerful organizations,

658
01:09:15,936 --> 01:09:21,936
they just didn't care because like it wasn't an interest for them and there wasn't like a they just didn't care about it.

659
01:09:21,936 --> 01:09:23,666
And so those meetings never went anywhere.

660
01:09:23,676 --> 01:09:28,716
But when I talked with someone who actually cared about like health care because it was about space, it actually went somewhere.

661
01:09:28,716 --> 01:09:35,496
Even if we weren't like financially contributing, we had a lot of like resources that would help them try to take their other members and stuff too.

662
01:09:35,526 --> 01:09:39,776
So I think it's both. You know, I would argue then to your point anon,

663
01:09:39,786 --> 01:09:49,925
it's a strategic again that kind of strategy as is the new movement capacity is strategy as this will be our new our new sort of for the month,

664
01:09:49,926 --> 01:09:52,506
word of the month. It's our strategy that we're using.

665
01:09:52,926 --> 01:10:00,216
So if I spend all my time trying to get the dollars to open the door, but I don't have a message to give when the door is open,

666
01:10:00,666 --> 01:10:05,256
then I lost the relationship because at the end of the day, the door is open.

667
01:10:06,036 --> 01:10:09,996
You sit down and they're going to look at you. They're going to say, What can I help you with?

668
01:10:10,866 --> 01:10:16,116
You got it. You got my time. You have your 15 minutes of my undivided attention.

669
01:10:17,436 --> 01:10:20,466
And my staff's attention work. Yeah.

670
01:10:20,486 --> 01:10:23,876
I was going to say because I used to, like train people on how to have effective meetings.

671
01:10:24,206 --> 01:10:28,945
And part of our training was like, you don't know if your meetings in a trance like thumping in an elevator.

672
01:10:28,946 --> 01:10:32,046
So you have to make it like your demands right off the bat and like, be short.

673
01:10:32,066 --> 01:10:36,146
So there was like a strategy to and how we talked to them to make sure we would, like, grasp our attention really quick.

674
01:10:36,416 --> 01:10:40,066
All right. So Orrin Hatch, very famous example of this.

675
01:10:40,076 --> 01:10:45,535
Orrin Hatch had build relationships with these advocacy organizations that were

676
01:10:45,536 --> 01:10:51,716
advocating in 2006 for changes to laws related to embryonic stem cell research.

677
01:10:52,106 --> 01:11:02,306
This was in 2006, was President Bush's first veto because at the time, the administration had had a full Republican Congress, both Senate and House.

678
01:11:02,756 --> 01:11:08,756
So it was still a full, full Senate, Republican president, Republican Senate, Republican House of Representatives.

679
01:11:09,326 --> 01:11:16,736
And this was the first time that the Congress actually voted outside of the interest of President Bush.

680
01:11:17,606 --> 01:11:27,206
And many had kind of attributed this this this change to the fact that members like Senator Hatch had become personally tied to some of these issues.

681
01:11:27,596 --> 01:11:33,506
They had grandchildren who would benefit, you know, who had certain diseases that might benefit from this type of research.

682
01:11:34,076 --> 01:11:38,216
They had friends. They knew people. The idea is, is that they had an interest.

683
01:11:38,246 --> 01:11:45,085
So this is this is I think it's a great question and I'm glad you raised it, because this is the we hear this term all the time.

684
01:11:45,086 --> 01:11:49,376
You know, it's just the the special interest is the people that give the money.

685
01:11:49,616 --> 01:11:53,786
But there's something that happens afterwards after the money exchanges.

686
01:11:55,196 --> 01:12:03,836
Okay. So what are interest groups? Well, organizations that are comprised of individuals, enterprises with shared points of view on issues.

687
01:12:04,676 --> 01:12:06,656
We hear the term government relations.

688
01:12:06,746 --> 01:12:16,286
So application of a particular communication technique by an individual or an institution to affect specifically the decision of the government.

689
01:12:16,616 --> 01:12:22,076
And that can be at the local, the state, the national or even the international level or some combination.

690
01:12:23,846 --> 01:12:28,016
And we see a lot of different types of government relations, protests being one.

691
01:12:28,286 --> 01:12:38,846
Jeff Flake, Senator from Arizona, if you recall, back to the nominations of Justice Kavanaugh and Justice Gorsuch,

692
01:12:39,486 --> 01:12:45,746
it was more so was Justice Kavanaugh that this was the strategy that many organizations had taken.

693
01:12:45,896 --> 01:12:54,505
It was, you know, find Senator Flake from Arizona and the elevator well and get to him, you know, and you don't have more than 10 seconds.

694
01:12:54,506 --> 01:12:59,906
So hold up signs and talk really loud and try to get his attention.

695
01:13:00,296 --> 01:13:02,846
And to a certain extent, it had an impact.

696
01:13:03,446 --> 01:13:13,046
He was one of the Republican senators who was willing to stop the vote on Justice Kavanaugh at that time to consider a couple of other

697
01:13:13,586 --> 01:13:25,586
elements of what of what had been discussed in the hearings didn't prove to be enough to that to create a failure in the confirmation.

698
01:13:25,856 --> 01:13:28,916
But you could see that that was the strategy that was being employed.

699
01:13:29,426 --> 01:13:34,676
So protesting communication, alliances and knowing you talked a little bit about alliances,

700
01:13:34,676 --> 01:13:40,556
Christiana, you were talking about kind of partnerships, um, fundraising campaigns.

701
01:13:40,556 --> 01:13:43,016
These are all sort of types of government relations.

702
01:13:43,966 --> 01:13:51,195
Now the nonprofit has ac3 as we continue to discuss can't directly advocate but certainly can do things either set

703
01:13:51,196 --> 01:13:57,546
the table for good C for or help to kind of create an environment in which things will be more favorable for.

704
01:13:59,146 --> 01:14:02,955
So government relations is not just about big policy changes.

705
01:14:02,956 --> 01:14:05,866
It's about, you know, finding resolution to conflict.

706
01:14:06,856 --> 01:14:17,026
You know, it's essential to the perpetuation of of a of a societal goal, funneling important information and analysis to government leaders.

707
01:14:17,506 --> 01:14:25,606
The University of Michigan gets a certain allotment from the legislature every year, and it lobbies directly for that.

708
01:14:25,936 --> 01:14:33,136
But its process of lobbying for that is one that's typically built around funneling that information,

709
01:14:33,136 --> 01:14:40,206
making sure the legislature understands, and then creating a system of checks and balances comparable to what we see with the government.

710
01:14:40,216 --> 01:14:46,666
But thinking about competition among these interest groups and having not one sort of have

711
01:14:47,896 --> 01:14:53,236
sort of a hydroponic set of power being that there are different interest groups competing,

712
01:14:54,136 --> 01:15:02,086
different interests sort of working toward either a coalition school or perhaps that one is getting priority versus a.

713
01:15:03,976 --> 01:15:08,866
Your life lay out for you kind of a few different modes of government relations,

714
01:15:09,496 --> 01:15:17,956
the nonprofit and the government sort of supplementing in the left in complimentary to each other in the middle figure or in an adversarial role.

715
01:15:18,316 --> 01:15:23,056
On the other picture, on the right, it depends on where you stand on that particular issue.

716
01:15:24,136 --> 01:15:31,846
So just quickly, supplementary non-profits fulfilling the demand left unsatisfied by the government.

717
01:15:32,456 --> 01:15:40,306
Right. So the nonprofit is filling in a blank. We talked about that in our example today with the organization in Colorado.

718
01:15:40,606 --> 01:15:45,826
And again, what is it? Come. Cool. Thank you. Well, cobalt cobalt is filling in the blank.

719
01:15:45,976 --> 01:15:52,966
It's finding a gap in service and it's unsatisfied by the government.

720
01:15:53,296 --> 01:15:56,686
And so it's looking to try and supplement.

721
01:15:58,816 --> 01:16:05,566
Sometimes the nonprofit is a partner. So in the complimentary example, they're partner to the government, so they're helping to deliver public goods.

722
01:16:05,956 --> 01:16:11,446
What can we think of during COVID? What was what was a complementary relationship with nonprofits and the government?

723
01:16:12,886 --> 01:16:16,966
What kinds of things was that? Were nonprofits any different? Complementary?

724
01:16:22,616 --> 01:16:29,066
Testing. Good testing for COVID. Yeah. The organization that I talked about in my current events presentation like

725
01:16:29,066 --> 01:16:32,846
received money from the government to set up feeding sites to give food to people.

726
01:16:34,196 --> 01:16:36,626
So. Right. So the government wasn't to do it itself.

727
01:16:36,866 --> 01:16:44,176
It was dispatching to the nonprofit that is similar to and I don't want to be have have you feel I'm making

728
01:16:44,216 --> 01:16:51,896
literal examples of caveat but not dissimilar in metaphorically to when you have a corporate entity like say,

729
01:16:51,896 --> 01:16:58,076
Verizon or AT&T and then it has franchises, it's, you know, it's funneling dollars with franchises and basically saying,

730
01:16:58,076 --> 01:17:03,746
all right, we the corporation, we're not going to run all that. We're going to give you the dollars and you kind of decided you will.

731
01:17:03,806 --> 01:17:09,326
Ironic that we have the adversarial relationship.

732
01:17:09,476 --> 01:17:16,616
So the nonprofit prodding the government to make a change in public policy and maintain its accountability.

733
01:17:17,156 --> 01:17:25,735
So we saw this quite a bit during the 2017 to 2021 ish period when we saw nonprofits sort of

734
01:17:25,736 --> 01:17:33,266
acting in an adversarial role to actions that the Trump administration was looking to achieve.

735
01:17:34,856 --> 01:17:42,626
So I'm giving you here just some examples. You could take a look at them when you have some more time and read through them.

736
01:17:42,986 --> 01:17:51,836
But you can see here how we can we can kind of categorize supplementary, complementary and adversarial support with different organization types.

737
01:17:53,156 --> 01:17:57,106
So again, coming back to the question of why, why organizations.

738
01:17:58,196 --> 01:18:02,456
So they might be gaining benefits that are unavailable to the private sector.

739
01:18:02,906 --> 01:18:08,246
I'd be looking to retain or gain an economic advantage in my ability to create a beneficial program.

740
01:18:08,636 --> 01:18:15,265
Or they might be looking to resolve a public problem that only the government can handle, meaning they're not going to be able to do it themselves.

741
01:18:15,266 --> 01:18:21,866
They need the government involved. They need a barrier to be removed, the dollars to be allotted, etc.

742
01:18:23,836 --> 01:18:30,246
I put this slide in here now because we're, of course, focused on hospitals, but we're thinking about health services organizations.

743
01:18:30,256 --> 01:18:38,236
I want you to just be thoughtful of the health care delivery system and sort of the component related to regulation.

744
01:18:38,776 --> 01:18:46,906
So with regulating hospitals and by proxy, start to give some thought to if you're lobbying, if you're a health services nonprofit.

745
01:18:47,236 --> 01:18:53,806
Who is it that you might be looking at? You may not be looking at the EPA necessarily.

746
01:18:54,046 --> 01:18:58,246
You might be looking at, you know, CMS, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services,

747
01:18:58,246 --> 01:19:03,375
as sort of a target where you want to be doing lobbying, where you could see rules change,

748
01:19:03,376 --> 01:19:09,976
where you could see actions that might directly influence so long term care facilities

749
01:19:09,976 --> 01:19:16,845
in 2021 had a vaccine mandate imposed on them by the Biden administration,

750
01:19:16,846 --> 01:19:20,326
and it was a rule that was codified inside of CMS.

751
01:19:20,926 --> 01:19:26,476
So the rule came down. If you work for a long term care facility or if you've run in long term care facility or if you're.

752
01:19:27,586 --> 01:19:31,136
An administrator, but basically all your employees have to be vaccinated.

753
01:19:31,936 --> 01:19:40,126
So, you know, it was up to these facilities to either be the ones advocating or lobbying or that rule or those advocating against.

754
01:19:40,156 --> 01:19:47,296
But the point I want to kind of make here a double underline here is it was that they were recognizing where to go,

755
01:19:47,596 --> 01:19:54,136
where it was that they needed to be channeling their energy and their advocacy energy, knowing what mechanism to take.

756
01:19:54,856 --> 01:20:04,536
So the case that we've talked about today with Proposal three. Planned Parenthood of Michigan and its partners knew that the next step was validation.

757
01:20:04,906 --> 01:20:08,596
They had planned for that clearly, because it was mobilized very quickly.

758
01:20:08,986 --> 01:20:11,206
They knew that that's where they needed to go next.

759
01:20:11,326 --> 01:20:18,956
They weren't going to spend time lobbying the legislature and were going to spend time trying to, you know, it went be the courts.

760
01:20:18,976 --> 01:20:22,066
They were very intentional and they did some in the courts because they were

761
01:20:22,066 --> 01:20:26,535
very intentional about saying we're not going to waste time or waste any cycle,

762
01:20:26,536 --> 01:20:31,946
no time better than the present. We're going to go in and advocate for a ballot initiative now.

763
01:20:32,956 --> 01:20:37,696
And that's what happened. So so knowing who you are talking to is important.

764
01:20:38,476 --> 01:20:43,006
So inside of the organizations that you're working with and learning about study and talking about

765
01:20:43,456 --> 01:20:48,046
the government relations folks are typically relating their typically reporting directly to the CEO.

766
01:20:49,036 --> 01:20:55,966
They're usually dedicating most of their time to government relations activities directly.

767
01:20:56,866 --> 01:21:01,606
But we also have to think about the fact that some of them are integrated into other efforts.

768
01:21:01,936 --> 01:21:04,996
Sometimes government relations might be grouped with philanthropy,

769
01:21:05,296 --> 01:21:11,016
especially an organization that's looking to extract most of its rapid or secure most of its revenue from government sources.

770
01:21:11,026 --> 01:21:20,505
So you can see how maybe those two might be linked together. But most health care delivery organizations and larger health services nonprofits are

771
01:21:20,506 --> 01:21:24,436
going to have some kind of a standalone government relations person or department,

772
01:21:25,186 --> 01:21:33,916
and they're usually going to have a pretty limited staff because there's not a ton for that staff to do.

773
01:21:34,186 --> 01:21:41,176
Aside from that relationship building process and kind of keeping those relationships relevant now.

774
01:21:42,216 --> 01:21:44,106
In talking about strategic planning,

775
01:21:44,406 --> 01:21:50,585
I would challenge that assumption and ask all of you to kind of give some thought to should it be small, you know,

776
01:21:50,586 --> 01:21:56,226
should the organization invest more of its dollars in being a little bit more strategic about having

777
01:21:56,226 --> 01:22:02,856
more people responsible for this process and not necessarily relying on a smaller group to do that?

778
01:22:04,116 --> 01:22:07,736
So that's certainly because many of the delivery organizations are going to

779
01:22:07,736 --> 01:22:12,016
see much of their revenue coming from Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements.

780
01:22:12,026 --> 01:22:18,596
But to a certain extent, you can think about the other organizations that we're studying as being connected to those.

781
01:22:19,016 --> 01:22:26,126
So if a hospital is large or an academic health center is large, all the organizations that may get the patients referred from that hospital,

782
01:22:26,426 --> 01:22:30,356
it may secure services through and referrals through that hospital.

783
01:22:30,626 --> 01:22:36,636
All of that will hinge on a strong delivery system that can really have any effect.

784
01:22:37,766 --> 01:22:40,420
So with that, I'm positive.

785
01:22:45,718 --> 01:22:52,708
Thank you. I don't know if you come.

786
01:22:53,528 --> 01:22:56,908
All right. I'm going to turn it over to our case group.

787
01:22:56,908 --> 01:23:00,868
I ask them to, again, like we did last week, and for the remaining groups, just kind of,

788
01:23:01,588 --> 01:23:05,518
you know, and they've already done an excellent job for practice, not calling them out,

789
01:23:05,818 --> 01:23:10,377
but just to keep you keep keep your mind focused in these presentations and sort of

790
01:23:10,378 --> 01:23:15,538
how can you present the key issues quickly and get to a discussion since everyone.

791
01:23:18,508 --> 01:23:25,977
We're going to be presenting on the website in case. So where are the Saugatuck students?

792
01:23:25,978 --> 01:23:32,348
And if I'm pronouncing that right, it's about 45 minutes west of Grand Rapids.

793
01:23:32,368 --> 01:23:40,378
It's 2.5 miles of shoreline on Lake Michigan, where there's 200 feet tall dunes, there's hiking trails.

794
01:23:40,388 --> 01:23:47,128
There is a dangerous species. I find this really cool because I'm from New Jersey and the Jersey Shore is just something else.

795
01:23:47,138 --> 01:23:56,608
So we don't have anything really like this. So a visit for me and then it is going to be like, it's beautiful.

796
01:23:56,638 --> 01:24:01,048
Yeah, I mean, it's pretty small compared to other days, but it's nice.

797
01:24:03,868 --> 01:24:06,418
Okay. So I'll take you through the background a little bit.

798
01:24:06,418 --> 01:24:13,918
I don't want to revise too much with it because you should have read the case, but this is just it was kind of a convoluted case.

799
01:24:13,918 --> 01:24:19,707
I feel like things were all over the place. So I tried to, in my background, make it a little less confusing.

800
01:24:19,708 --> 01:24:24,267
So this is just a timeline of things and I'll go more stuff about it.

801
01:24:24,268 --> 01:24:33,028
But in 2016, it was founded by Dr. Ansel and Darleen Hightower, and there were three anchor institutions, but now there's six.

802
01:24:33,028 --> 01:24:42,088
So basically two anchor institutions are part of the community and they help give money and provide the services and those institutions.

803
01:24:42,568 --> 01:24:48,508
You guys wrote about it, I don't need to go into it. And then they did listening tours to kind of develop their goals and they hired

804
01:24:48,508 --> 01:24:52,737
staff and they continue to work for their goals until 2020 when the pandemic hit.

805
01:24:52,738 --> 01:24:56,608
And it was kind of like, Oh, what do we do now? Situation. So go further in depth.

806
01:24:57,958 --> 01:25:03,328
Their mission is to build a community health and economic wellness of Chicago's West Side.

807
01:25:04,198 --> 01:25:10,318
But the main goal is to reduce the life expectancy between Westside neighborhoods by 50% by 2023.

808
01:25:12,128 --> 01:25:15,788
And to do this, they were on listening tours. Yes.

809
01:25:15,998 --> 01:25:20,708
Because they wanted to build trust within the community. And that was a big thing that was talked a lot throughout the case.

810
01:25:21,548 --> 01:25:25,838
And they went to a bunch of neighborhoods, ten, to be exact, on the West Side.

811
01:25:26,018 --> 01:25:28,868
And they want many venues to hear what the president had to say.

812
01:25:29,678 --> 01:25:34,688
And they basically came to the decision that they wanted this to be a shared decision making process between the community.

813
01:25:34,898 --> 01:25:43,298
They didn't want the this organization coming in and doing nothing and then doing one thing and then leaving.

814
01:25:44,228 --> 01:25:52,418
And then through the listening tour, as they found out, like what they did, that they wanted a desire for jobs and maybe to become business owners.

815
01:25:53,198 --> 01:25:56,378
And there were also issues of mass incarceration and mental health.

816
01:25:57,738 --> 01:25:59,947
And these are four pillars. Again, I won't go deep into it,

817
01:25:59,948 --> 01:26:06,368
but it's very important because this is what guided all of their goals and the metrics to what they wanted to do before the pandemic.

818
01:26:09,008 --> 01:26:18,218
And this is everything they did pre-pandemic, all the money that they made trying to kind of put it together and not 33 pages.

819
01:26:20,108 --> 01:26:21,128
So yeah, they had it.

820
01:26:21,128 --> 01:26:29,948
Most of their money Medical Center was one of their anchor institutions, which they got all most of their funding from and volunteers from.

821
01:26:30,698 --> 01:26:35,318
They also had a 1000 day plan by me, by consultants, but of course,

822
01:26:35,338 --> 01:26:42,798
animals over in the situation, their governing structure included committee community members.

823
01:26:43,028 --> 01:26:48,158
Like I said, they hired staff and then they partner with CDP eyes,

824
01:26:48,158 --> 01:26:53,947
which are community driven financial institutions which basically help expand the local economy.

825
01:26:53,948 --> 01:26:55,958
And they had four of the partners.

826
01:26:57,308 --> 01:27:03,758
And yeah, this last thing, like I don't really know why they had $2 million to four, the 500,000 and then 3 million again.

827
01:27:04,358 --> 01:27:14,978
Explain that. But yes, and then the pandemic hit and this is my last background side, but this is basically kind of a where we are now.

828
01:27:15,188 --> 01:27:21,728
It's June 2022. And when the pandemic hit, they joined the Chicago mayor and they kind of diverted from their mission.

829
01:27:22,988 --> 01:27:27,547
Instead of focusing on the ten West Side communities,

830
01:27:27,548 --> 01:27:33,968
they now focus on all neighborhoods in Chicago by to find supplies for COVID and small business grants.

831
01:27:33,968 --> 01:27:38,767
And then they also helped Healthy Chicago build Healthy Chicago 2025,

832
01:27:38,768 --> 01:27:45,848
which means it is giving them a lot of traction and attention from community members, which leads us to our situation.

833
01:27:47,438 --> 01:27:56,168
Right. So literally set it up for us. So WSC basically has to make several decisions in order to address their 1000 people.

834
01:27:56,678 --> 01:28:04,868
So that's the situation that we're in. And we started looking for questions that basically City was asking themselves.

835
01:28:05,168 --> 01:28:08,978
So by December they had a goal, which is six months away from that time,

836
01:28:09,278 --> 01:28:15,818
to reaffirm the mission commitments because the senior leadership at the various hospitals and institutions have changed.

837
01:28:15,818 --> 01:28:21,217
So they kind of have to like we sell the mission to them, so make them want to agree to do it again and continue.

838
01:28:21,218 --> 01:28:31,178
So they're thinking through how they do that. The second question is, is now the right time for you to go from a coalition to a 523?

839
01:28:31,468 --> 01:28:37,777
Right now, they have like the support of all the hospitals, institutions once again, but their goal is to become a pilot on security.

840
01:28:37,778 --> 01:28:40,088
So they're thinking through, is this the right tactic?

841
01:28:40,088 --> 01:28:47,228
The third question is, is there anything that they can do about the stalled momentum for the workgroups on priority tasks?

842
01:28:47,558 --> 01:28:51,787
And something important to consider is that they made a big deal about having

843
01:28:51,788 --> 01:28:54,878
the public eye on that when they were starting to get all that recognition.

844
01:28:55,148 --> 01:29:00,097
So they don't want to look bad now that, you know, they got all the recognition and stopped doing commission.

845
01:29:00,098 --> 01:29:07,088
So what can they do to, you know, overcome that all the time or should they even because the pandemic and the last,

846
01:29:07,298 --> 01:29:14,018
they also had a goal by October 1st. This was a specific goal to expand the senior leadership at the school,

847
01:29:14,258 --> 01:29:21,938
because we know that they relied on their community partnerships and stuff like that to do their strategic planning and fundraising.

848
01:29:22,298 --> 01:29:28,888
So Cole is really focusing on building that team within WSU itself to be able to be self-sustainable.

849
01:29:29,598 --> 01:29:37,808
So is that still possible to do? And then these are the questions that we're considering based off of those four questions.

850
01:29:38,168 --> 01:29:42,847
So at the height of the pandemic, these hospitals are all in like disarray.

851
01:29:42,848 --> 01:29:51,638
This is June 2020. How does WSU best use their time and resources to kind of get these deployments going on again?

852
01:29:51,698 --> 01:29:57,968
Like we celebrate because thinking about like how people are overwhelmed with COVID and the senior

853
01:29:57,968 --> 01:30:04,508
leadership is dealing with cope with most of these hospitals not dealing with how to plan that out,

854
01:30:04,688 --> 01:30:09,128
how they also make their commitments a priority to these institutions.

855
01:30:10,238 --> 01:30:16,688
Second is, where would their funding come from if they choose to be a final with PPE is right now they're competing on Rush,

856
01:30:16,868 --> 01:30:21,788
like I said, Rush's gift of $6 million. So if they were to become independent 523,

857
01:30:22,028 --> 01:30:29,588
they'd have to start from ground up pretty much to find their own money at the end or the star momentum for work.

858
01:30:29,588 --> 01:30:33,068
It's hurt the trust that WSU has worked so hard to build within the community.

859
01:30:33,398 --> 01:30:34,958
So like on my side, once again,

860
01:30:35,168 --> 01:30:42,038
they put a lot into like having the community and the decision making process informing what their programing is and all that.

861
01:30:42,278 --> 01:30:46,988
So is this stalled momentum right now going to hurt that trust that they worked so hard to build?

862
01:30:47,438 --> 01:30:51,458
And then something that came up in the case was community engagement fatigue.

863
01:30:51,698 --> 01:30:57,488
So people in the community were talking about how they're just kind of tired of, you know, getting their input and not seeing the input being used.

864
01:30:57,698 --> 01:31:04,218
So is this going to hurt that as well? And how do they continue to work with the community very rapidly?

865
01:31:04,568 --> 01:31:10,688
Because it's not only affecting the community, but also. These workers and the anchor of commitments as well.

866
01:31:10,998 --> 01:31:19,358
And in the last three months, enough time for WASC to expand to get all the senior leadership positions that they wanted to give?

867
01:31:20,908 --> 01:31:28,908
So our hypothesis was to keep telling us, you focus on all of Chicago during a pandemic,

868
01:31:28,918 --> 01:31:35,188
because one thing they had to do with their mission a little bit from the West Side because of COVID and help all of Chicago.

869
01:31:35,488 --> 01:31:40,588
So we thought that for the rest of the year at least, to like December,

870
01:31:40,588 --> 01:31:43,707
let's just focus on all of Chicago, because this is the height of the pandemic.

871
01:31:43,708 --> 01:31:52,678
So it made sense to do that. But second, they should prioritize really trying to reaffirm those anchored mission commitments.

872
01:31:53,338 --> 01:32:01,317
Just meeting around the senior leaders schedule, using the accomplishment metrics that you have on page 26 list of all that they were able to do,

873
01:32:01,318 --> 01:32:06,088
just to kind of use that as like evidence that this is something that you should want to commit to.

874
01:32:06,568 --> 01:32:11,488
And then also phrasing this as the optimal time to continue those impacts because

875
01:32:11,488 --> 01:32:18,028
we're in a pandemic and things are going to kind of get worse from here. So this is a time to reaffirm that, and we commit to what we're doing here.

876
01:32:19,048 --> 01:32:23,818
And then we said that they should wait until they are more stable before they become a nonprofit.

877
01:32:24,448 --> 01:32:28,168
They don't really have the senior leadership to, like, sustain that independent status.

878
01:32:28,348 --> 01:32:35,158
And we also don't know where their funding is. So just kind of finding time to build those senior leadership positions and hire people in those,

879
01:32:35,398 --> 01:32:40,768
and then a strategic plan for how to become a finalist.

880
01:32:41,758 --> 01:32:46,467
And the last just kind of understanding that COVID is affecting everyone.

881
01:32:46,468 --> 01:32:52,378
So maintaining seeing side to side of transcript, communication with community partners,

882
01:32:52,708 --> 01:32:58,617
and then reassessing needs and capacity as the COVID pandemic goes on and they're transferring as

883
01:32:58,618 --> 01:33:06,268
many services as possible to the town to just kind of the standstill that they're at right now,

884
01:33:08,698 --> 01:33:19,928
just for like given how intense or or, you know, comprehensive this case was, it would be good to like back to where they are to a point.

885
01:33:20,098 --> 01:33:26,428
That's why this sort of doing this more analysis. So starting with first one, would you like given the back at all, get ready.

886
01:33:27,148 --> 01:33:31,948
Would you be able to like talk about some of the strengths of this organization?

887
01:33:38,148 --> 01:33:46,778
Do you have an amazing network like now looking out for all of our partners and so many organizations?

888
01:33:48,608 --> 01:33:55,988
Yeah, that so that was my first point, though, that they have like an amazing network of hospitals,

889
01:33:55,988 --> 01:33:59,947
community members and so, you know, banks and local government.

890
01:33:59,948 --> 01:34:04,958
And the important point was that all the activities for whom they were doing the community,

891
01:34:04,958 --> 01:34:10,688
what they were doing, they had to see that and they were part of all the processes.

892
01:34:10,928 --> 01:34:14,408
So they actually had a voice in it and the manage,

893
01:34:14,858 --> 01:34:21,788
the getting what they can and taken seriously and the management, instead of being talked down was bottoms up.

894
01:34:22,058 --> 01:34:27,788
So they actually fell apart of all the things that were going to happen to them.

895
01:34:28,118 --> 01:34:35,258
And finally, of all the pillows, the four pillows that they decided to work on for the community,

896
01:34:35,258 --> 01:34:40,147
for each of them, they had a strong governance system and there was extreme transparency.

897
01:34:40,148 --> 01:34:44,968
So I felt these were the strains of coming to weaknesses.

898
01:34:48,828 --> 01:34:56,738
Mistrust amongst the different leaders and then kind of like disconnectedness in terms of communication.

899
01:34:58,148 --> 01:35:04,758
I think goes bad, especially because the case mentioned when they were working with the government, you know,

900
01:35:04,788 --> 01:35:09,318
every time they would have an election and there would be new people being elected and they would have to like,

901
01:35:09,318 --> 01:35:13,818
you know, like basically make them part of the onboarding process and kind of keep them updated.

902
01:35:15,588 --> 01:35:23,258
So yeah, the first point I thought was they were like extreme dependance on the donation from the Russian system.

903
01:35:23,688 --> 01:35:28,248
So that was a fight. It is a strength now, but considering their future,

904
01:35:28,248 --> 01:35:36,168
what was they would have figured out a way around that and could become a weakness of the game because of the pandemic.

905
01:35:36,228 --> 01:35:41,268
So their budgets and the budgets are already stretched and they are cutting staff as well with that.

906
01:35:41,668 --> 01:35:49,818
And yeah, like the hospitals from when they were getting funding, the six hospitals at the leadership level there was still unusual.

907
01:35:50,178 --> 01:36:00,947
So like as General mentioned, they would again have to be sold on the idea of go of my site to get the continued funding coming.

908
01:36:00,948 --> 01:36:13,758
So fortunately. Opportunities are internal or external service means.

909
01:36:16,968 --> 01:36:22,338
I mean, I could start that give you an idea. I mean, I part this part I could be like, you know, even I'm learning.

910
01:36:22,418 --> 01:36:25,068
I could have missed something or at least something in the wrong.

911
01:36:25,078 --> 01:36:31,707
But you need to connect with what I thought when Opportunity was buying, because during the COVID pandemic,

912
01:36:31,708 --> 01:36:37,998
they did move from their commitment to a bit to their community to the entire the whole of Chicago.

913
01:36:37,998 --> 01:36:42,918
But this could be looked at as an opportunity because it gave them the visibility and the name.

914
01:36:42,918 --> 01:36:48,108
Now, apart from the neighborhood they were working with a who Chicago knew about their work.

915
01:36:48,318 --> 01:36:54,758
So that became like an opportunity for them. The second one I fell about another one more time.

916
01:36:55,248 --> 01:37:00,348
They were working with the other four fellows that they had decided and they had a mission.

917
01:37:00,738 --> 01:37:08,138
But they did, you know. Come with the government to look for other ideas like gun violence.

918
01:37:08,408 --> 01:37:14,168
So that was maybe stretching or going beyond what the strategy was.

919
01:37:14,528 --> 01:37:23,858
And I'm buying the how am I mentioned about the email to the people to get the ideal opinion on what they wanted to do.

920
01:37:23,868 --> 01:37:28,208
But still, there was a lot to learn from these listening sessions.

921
01:37:28,538 --> 01:37:31,538
One thing that had got me out was about the food distribution,

922
01:37:31,538 --> 01:37:38,437
how a lot of food was going to waste because it was not what they wanted and they were tired of eating that kind of food store.

923
01:37:38,438 --> 01:37:48,698
And these new information was still coming out from the voice thought that would again be leveraged to seek new opportunities.

924
01:37:49,178 --> 01:37:54,758
I just want to just a quick point of feedback so meant for folks who are still finalizing their assignment.

925
01:37:55,178 --> 01:37:58,088
So these are excellent examples of opportunities.

926
01:37:58,448 --> 01:38:06,158
The only thing I would revise is just as you as you framed them, think about the external component that you're referring to.

927
01:38:06,878 --> 01:38:12,248
So, for example, in your first opportunity, you pointed out Chicago's COVID response.

928
01:38:12,398 --> 01:38:17,468
That's the external piece versus the organization's role in it.

929
01:38:17,858 --> 01:38:21,008
So the organization's role in the COVID response is more internal.

930
01:38:21,008 --> 01:38:25,628
But the fact that Chicago has a robust COVID response, that's an external piece.

931
01:38:26,078 --> 01:38:31,208
Same with the second one. So it's a coalition. The fact that there is a coalition that this exists.

932
01:38:31,358 --> 01:38:37,298
That's the external. The third one is the fact that the community is willing to engage in listening sessions.

933
01:38:37,778 --> 01:38:40,778
That would be the external. So excellent, excellent examples.

934
01:38:40,778 --> 01:38:47,268
Just make sure when you're framing them that to that. May finally coming through.

935
01:38:48,528 --> 01:38:53,278
Sorry, I lost my idea. And the last one was in the sense.

936
01:38:53,368 --> 01:38:56,928
So this isn't doing that. I misplaced it. But it goes like.

937
01:38:57,588 --> 01:39:02,958
Of like now that it does correlations or if in future they want to become five,

938
01:39:03,008 --> 01:39:08,058
once you five even have to develop a roadmap to do that, like becoming a51,

939
01:39:08,118 --> 01:39:17,508
the three would like meet them independent from the hospital system or that they are a part of and it could bring its own benefits with them.

940
01:39:17,508 --> 01:39:24,468
Survive currently not on plan could in future be helpful address.

941
01:39:31,918 --> 01:39:38,248
I think the threads that I was just going to say, I mean, I think COVID is both an opportunity and probably.

942
01:39:39,098 --> 01:39:43,198
Yeah. Just one more person.

943
01:39:43,338 --> 01:39:47,398
Yeah, but it's a little quiet.

944
01:39:48,778 --> 01:39:52,468
I thought we could come up with a few more threats. Let's help our great group out here.

945
01:39:53,158 --> 01:40:00,658
I really mean being stuck in the silent role. I think the community's frustration with the system is.

946
01:40:01,838 --> 01:40:18,618
And. What else? I guess that it could be a distraction to this this like the opportunity to.

947
01:40:19,758 --> 01:40:26,028
Become a nonprofit could distract them from their original mission.

948
01:40:27,658 --> 01:40:33,018
An external piece, though, that would consist of an internal.

949
01:40:33,078 --> 01:40:42,628
I guess that's a weakness. Yeah. That's a good example of an internal weakness.

950
01:40:42,928 --> 01:40:44,248
I'm just thinking in terms of.

951
01:40:45,978 --> 01:40:51,318
You know, there are probably other hospital systems or single hospitals within the city that are probably trying to do similar work,

952
01:40:51,318 --> 01:40:53,188
and they're doing it better.

953
01:40:53,228 --> 01:41:04,608
And, you know, I think veterans, you losing respect or trust in the community to other organizations that are doing a different or better job.

954
01:41:05,738 --> 01:41:16,638
I don't think about that, but that seems like ah yeah, that is factually correct that we are supposed to know that I am not on the wrong side.

955
01:41:16,778 --> 01:41:24,308
That's okay. This is I want to commend the group, your group for applying what we're talking about in the assignment to your presentation.

956
01:41:24,308 --> 01:41:27,608
This is excellent and okay, that's what we're here for to workshop together.

957
01:41:28,148 --> 01:41:36,068
I think the first one is kind of like third grade than to go with crisis cause you know, the initiatives that they were working on,

958
01:41:36,068 --> 01:41:44,218
it has delayed those initiatives of particularly being the hypertension control and maternal incentive,

959
01:41:44,228 --> 01:41:49,508
and that could lead to like a gain their trust issues from the community with whom they were voting,

960
01:41:49,508 --> 01:41:53,938
that maybe even this organization is eventually turning out to be the ah those like old

961
01:41:53,948 --> 01:42:02,468
promises and leaving us time and and the and the company had to like redirect the grants.

962
01:42:02,528 --> 01:42:04,868
So they have this funding system where, you know,

963
01:42:04,868 --> 01:42:10,748
the members of the community who want to start business but otherwise wouldn't have been eligible for loans,

964
01:42:10,748 --> 01:42:15,758
can get loans through them because of the funding that the site has.

965
01:42:16,628 --> 01:42:19,658
So that funding they had to like, you know,

966
01:42:19,718 --> 01:42:26,768
give it to the other business partners who are currently suffering and that can lead to trust issues from the community.

967
01:42:29,268 --> 01:42:34,438
Yeah. So now the artist is. So yeah, the first one is like, you know,

968
01:42:34,868 --> 01:42:42,008
they go and move on C3 but then they really have to figure out how to get the funding now because they become 522,

969
01:42:42,008 --> 01:42:47,887
they might not continue to have the kind of support they were having from the hospital system and it's become

970
01:42:47,888 --> 01:42:54,908
523 but don't hire the senior management that they are planning to hire because that required expenditure.

971
01:42:55,298 --> 01:43:02,798
And finally, is that going back to the ambition of, you know, working with the site community for the economic development,

972
01:43:02,798 --> 01:43:10,748
the social development, and then maybe in future in the future plan, they can have a component of expanding the whole of Chicago.

973
01:43:10,748 --> 01:43:18,748
But right now, focus on the. And then for our discussion, we posed two questions.

974
01:43:19,948 --> 01:43:26,768
So. First, do you think moving away from their efforts would cause mistrust?

975
01:43:27,098 --> 01:43:30,938
And if you think yes, like how you think, how do you think they need to repair that mistrust?

976
01:43:30,938 --> 01:43:37,808
And if no, so they change their mission. And then secondly, it's kind of like and in hindsight, what would you have done?

977
01:43:37,808 --> 01:43:42,218
Because it's been two years since June 20, 22 and a half years.

978
01:43:42,998 --> 01:43:50,468
So like, what would you have done in that situation, even though like obviously it was one of those like situational decision making type of things.

979
01:43:53,698 --> 01:43:56,728
Why do these as a class or do want to break up? What do you want to do?

980
01:43:57,508 --> 01:44:16,468
It's about fighting like this. I mean, our mission statement has remained the same to close the gap.

981
01:44:18,028 --> 01:44:21,478
That's their goal. Their goal of a different mission yet mission.

982
01:44:22,228 --> 01:44:32,638
I don't think it'll necessarily cause mistrust because community residents might be able to see why they would choose that path,

983
01:44:33,538 --> 01:44:38,308
especially if they can see results at the end of the game.

984
01:44:38,428 --> 01:44:41,788
I think that's the main thing, is the community wants more.

985
01:44:42,178 --> 01:44:49,108
They want more done. And if that takes this organization away, I can see them seeing it as like a repositioning.

986
01:44:51,968 --> 01:44:57,638
I think it depends on a lot of other factors, how the organization continues to train the community members as well.

987
01:44:58,008 --> 01:45:04,948
So. I think it's jumping on that a little bit.

988
01:45:05,538 --> 01:45:06,388
You know, obviously,

989
01:45:06,388 --> 01:45:13,978
they're going to be moving towards in the entirety of Chicago that will still encompass the neighborhoods that they've been focusing on originally.

990
01:45:14,338 --> 01:45:22,977
And as they talked about in the case, the individuals who will be most impacted by this and that we saw in COVID and how they've kind of highlighted

991
01:45:22,978 --> 01:45:31,588
it is the discrepancies in socio economic status and then black and brown individuals being much more impacted.

992
01:45:31,618 --> 01:45:39,838
So I think still, like they get to use what they're doing with the COVID movement here to continue

993
01:45:39,838 --> 01:45:43,678
their efforts within those communities and the neighborhoods particular.

994
01:45:43,678 --> 01:45:51,538
It'll just be kind of a little bit of a shift and broader distribution of their resources.

995
01:45:52,378 --> 01:45:54,868
Do you think they'll be as successful?

996
01:45:59,228 --> 01:46:07,148
Do you think they'll be as successful working with the whole Chicago improving stuff in West Chicago as it would be if they just focused on what,

997
01:46:07,148 --> 01:46:14,967
Chicago? I don't know that it would lead to mistrust either,

998
01:46:14,968 --> 01:46:21,027
but I think it definitely could lead residents feeling left behind or forgotten about more than anything else.

999
01:46:21,028 --> 01:46:25,018
And I think that is just as dangerous as mistrust.

1000
01:46:25,768 --> 01:46:29,188
Because if they're not, if you take care of them, why would they invest back?

1001
01:46:31,198 --> 01:46:36,178
Yeah, that was one of their worries during the listening tour. They didn't want someone to just come in, do one thing, and then leave.

1002
01:46:37,258 --> 01:46:44,308
So it's definitely something to consider. I want to push on a point that you raised your alternatives.

1003
01:46:44,558 --> 01:46:52,678
You made a very interesting observation, which is in your first alternative, becoming a5135 U.S.,

1004
01:46:52,698 --> 01:46:54,938
you would need to solicit strong support for its programing,

1005
01:46:55,178 --> 01:46:59,708
once independent from your support of the receiving through Russia's philanthropy department.

1006
01:47:00,368 --> 01:47:07,658
So one thing I would think about is I'm thinking I would I think I'm thinking about is because Russia's

1007
01:47:07,658 --> 01:47:15,128
philanthropy department then become a competitor to WSU and then does that contribute to potential kind

1008
01:47:15,158 --> 01:47:22,597
of decision making within the organization that maybe takes it away from the community because now it's

1009
01:47:22,598 --> 01:47:28,198
having to think more in its organizational interests as opposed to being able to be more missionary.

1010
01:47:30,018 --> 01:47:35,258
It has to raise money. That's what we were thinking about. It's like Russia gave $6 million.

1011
01:47:35,268 --> 01:47:38,798
So for them to and I think it just made Rush look good for one.

1012
01:47:39,168 --> 01:47:45,217
Like, why should we continue giving? Because they look good. So like now how would they be so focused on their mission if they also have to

1013
01:47:45,218 --> 01:47:48,668
spend so much time finding the funds to continue to do what they were doing?

1014
01:47:49,238 --> 01:47:52,508
Which is to say, that's why we said hold on.

1015
01:47:52,658 --> 01:48:05,987
I said, interesting hypothesis that you proposed, because in essence, you're saying not to become ac3 for a specific set of reasons.

1016
01:48:05,988 --> 01:48:14,317
So I said it's very, very interesting. I mean, think of becoming a 523 cause it creates a lot of work.

1017
01:48:14,318 --> 01:48:20,738
And if they don't have the manpower, the money to do that, especially during a pandemic, how do we do that?

1018
01:48:23,698 --> 01:48:27,698
Right. Said number two about the pandemic.

1019
01:48:27,878 --> 01:48:30,608
What can they do to continue their major initiatives?

1020
01:48:30,988 --> 01:48:37,898
And do you think that they should focus on hiring, expanding or working within like the actual inequities that are going on,

1021
01:48:37,938 --> 01:48:42,288
like the time that the pandemic brought to light.

1022
01:48:42,328 --> 01:48:43,028
And also.

1023
01:48:51,028 --> 01:48:59,638
Part of Evans talk is from yesterday, and they're talking about how like the best way you can help like a population is to help them help themselves.

1024
01:48:59,788 --> 01:49:07,678
So like capacity building expansion, but like having to be from the community and not like people coming in.

1025
01:49:08,518 --> 01:49:15,688
So I think the idea of focusing on putting resources into their desired area of a building.

1026
01:49:18,008 --> 01:49:21,308
But I don't know how you would do this necessarily.

1027
01:49:21,488 --> 01:49:30,998
I'm thinking about it. But focusing on helping, training, capacity building and to address the racial economic inequities would be the way to do it.

1028
01:49:31,628 --> 01:49:36,718
I don't think that there's going to be hiring and expanding, but kind of armed with that.

1029
01:49:36,758 --> 01:49:44,287
I think it's adjacent to and even before there was like this whole analogy about a doctor with like medicine or something like that.

1030
01:49:44,288 --> 01:49:47,768
And that's that's what they wanted to do with this pandemic.

1031
01:49:49,568 --> 01:49:57,248
So based off of like what you are saying about working with all of the back and forth, like working with all of Chicago, still helping Chicago,

1032
01:49:57,488 --> 01:50:01,178
do you think like there would be space within their staff to maybe have someone

1033
01:50:01,178 --> 01:50:07,088
focused on like with Chicago initiatives that are still like substantial.

1034
01:50:11,778 --> 01:50:17,778
I think that would be a good way to like show that they're still really invested in the west side of the city.

1035
01:50:18,768 --> 01:50:24,258
I think only if it's like paired with meaningful, like substantive work.

1036
01:50:24,468 --> 01:50:32,508
Yeah. Not just like someone's thinking about it, but just doing actual initiatives that, you know, residents have expressed would be helpful for them.

1037
01:50:36,928 --> 01:50:37,158
I mean,

1038
01:50:37,168 --> 01:50:46,158
I think that the organizational structure of our country was set up in a way that they have a lot of local organizations from the West Side anyway.

1039
01:50:46,168 --> 01:50:50,028
And so I don't like the fact that that's like incorporated into the organizational structure

1040
01:50:50,068 --> 01:50:54,718
can help them to have like a consortium for people working still on the West Side.

1041
01:50:58,408 --> 01:51:15,038
Sounds good to me. Last comment. I don't think it is our case specifically for helping us to think through this case.

1042
01:51:15,098 --> 01:51:28,958
I think that it is a good one. It presents sort of a choice on what we to consider when advertising is starting out for

1043
01:51:28,958 --> 01:51:33,308
making this decision of whether or not to become generalizations in the final three.

1044
01:51:35,098 --> 01:51:37,418
And you know what what what that means.

1045
01:51:37,418 --> 01:51:49,848
But its implications are and it was a very important point that the age group made excellent, excellent presentation due to their point, you know,

1046
01:51:50,048 --> 01:51:55,298
being able to look at the different sides of this and think about it before, just sort of jumping in and saying,

1047
01:51:55,298 --> 01:52:00,338
yeah, let's just keep going with that and making a decision based on when is the right time?

1048
01:52:00,728 --> 01:52:05,678
What does it mean for them? What implications? So engaging in good strategic planning.

1049
01:52:06,548 --> 01:52:14,498
So we will be back next week for our, our regular time.

1050
01:52:14,948 --> 01:52:18,878
Um, your paper or your assignments due tonight?

1051
01:52:19,388 --> 01:52:23,078
Um, let me know if you get any question.

1052
01:52:23,078 --> 01:52:31,448
Does try to keep my eye on the clock throughout the evening. Um, and then the next week we'll have class.

1053
01:52:31,508 --> 01:52:34,828
The following week will be, uh, adjourned.

1054
01:52:34,838 --> 01:52:40,597
As of Thanksgiving, we will be here, um, and then when we come back and actually have some more sessions.

1055
01:52:40,598 --> 01:52:48,698
So thank you all for keeping keeping the momentum as we continue to move through to the end of the term next

1056
01:52:48,698 --> 01:52:55,568
week I'll set up my expectations are for assignment three and how we're going to approach the slide deck.

1057
01:52:56,228 --> 01:53:00,748
But again thank you to David. Thank you Mr. French privacy decision.

1058
01:53:01,358 --> 01:53:18,588
Thank you to Christiana Une. The case presentation is going to be very brief.

1059
01:53:18,628 --> 01:53:37,597
I really think she has the great things like that.

1060
01:53:37,598 --> 01:53:56,918
We're going to be looking for 2022 like this year.

1061
