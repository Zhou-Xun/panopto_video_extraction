1
00:00:02,147 --> 00:00:05,650
Environmental and Cultural Contexts.

2
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:09,800
This session highlights framework for
consciously incorporating concepts of

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,650
racism into health disparities and
health equity work.

4
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:17,700
The goal is to think about the lived
experiences of vulnerable populations who

5
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:18,880
have no.

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,250
Or limited voice in
influencing the systematic ways

7
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:25,080
in which racism influences health.

8
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:30,450
Consider for a moment what good does it do
to treat people's illnesses, and then send

9
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:40,723
them back to live, play, and work within
the very conditions that made them sick?

10
00:00:40,723 --> 00:00:47,390
Key questions are, what places people at
risk for living in unhealthy environments?

11
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:50,740
And, what social determinants
have implications for

12
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:54,520
facilitating health or illness?

13
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,740
Research has identified
structural racism as a root cause

14
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:04,000
of disparities observed in health between
advantaged and disadvantaged groups.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,420
Public health critical race theory is
one approach used to directly address

16
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:10,670
racism in health.

17
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:13,480
What is Critical Race Theory?

18
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:18,990
Critical Race Theory is an anti-racist
intellectual movement to identify,

19
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:24,640
understand and undo the root
causes of racial hierarchies.

20
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,908
Critical Race Theory for Public Health
is one of several models that translates

21
00:01:28,908 --> 00:01:33,666
Critical Race Theories for
empirical research.

22
00:01:33,666 --> 00:01:37,332
It has four components to
guide its application.

23
00:01:37,332 --> 00:01:41,496
Contemporary racialization,
knowledge production,

24
00:01:41,496 --> 00:01:47,400
conceptualization & measurement,
and action.

25
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:52,218
Contemporary racialization identifies
racism as the predominant force in society

26
00:01:52,218 --> 00:01:54,200
that cannot be ignored.

27
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:59,185
Especially subtle forms of racism
that have been normalized in society.

28
00:01:59,185 --> 00:02:01,810
Knowledge production

29
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:07,780
is an awareness that your study findings
can reflect race related biases.

30
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:11,350
Self critiques are required to
challenge initial understandings with

31
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:16,430
findings providing a voice for
marginalized communities.

32
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:17,560
Conceptualization and

33
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:22,340
measurement consider the role of the
sociopolitical environment and oppressive

34
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:29,240
forces that produce effects based on
the intersection of social identities.

35
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:33,760
Finally, action reflects
disciplinary assessments of

36
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,310
unintended racial influences on
assumptions and methods used in

37
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:43,920
research that examine intersectionality
and give voice to the vulnerable.

38
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,230
And awareness of cultural humility and
self-critique

39
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:52,040
contributes to a better understanding
of how our personal norms and

40
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:57,830
conventions may undermine our
efforts to achieve health equity.

41
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:00,100
Another approach in health
equity research and

42
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:06,860
practice is using culturally relevant
theoretical frameworks to guide your work.

43
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:10,060
As examples, let's review
health promotion frameworks for

44
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:14,660
understanding the health
of Latino populations.

45
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:18,830
Examining racial identity among
Latinos provides a focus on how

46
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:22,870
racial categorization is dynamic,
and emphasizes the need for

47
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:28,290
a life course perspective to account for
accumulated negative exposures about self

48
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:32,650
that can be transmitted
across generations.

49
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:37,557
The family-community health promotion
model suggest the incorporation of family

50
00:03:37,557 --> 00:03:40,252
and cultural health traditions and
values and

51
00:03:40,252 --> 00:03:42,888
to health promotion research and practice.

52
00:03:42,888 --> 00:03:46,904
With an aim of also understanding
lower rates of adverse

53
00:03:46,904 --> 00:03:51,278
health outcomes among some
groups of poor Latino children.

54
00:03:51,278 --> 00:03:57,859
And the Eco-developmental Model addresses
highly prevalent health conditions for

55
00:03:57,859 --> 00:04:04,072
Latinos embedded within structural
conditions that produce risk for disease,

56
00:04:04,072 --> 00:04:10,397
and cultural factors that influence health
at multiple levels of intervention.

57
00:04:10,397 --> 00:04:15,651
Prominent in the application of these
frameworks, is the use of community based

58
00:04:15,651 --> 00:04:20,676
participatory research approaches to
ensure relevance to the population,

59
00:04:20,676 --> 00:04:24,618
and to address issues of
disenfranchisement, isolation,

60
00:04:24,618 --> 00:04:27,347
and mistrust among Latino populations.

61
00:04:27,347 --> 00:04:31,640
Continue to assess which conceptual
frameworks may be relevant to consider for

62
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,372
your final paper.
