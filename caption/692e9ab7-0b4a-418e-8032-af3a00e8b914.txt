1
00:02:14,675 --> 00:02:21,435
Recording in progress. Okay.

2
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:26,205
Do you want me to go over the triangle thing? If you think it was hard?

3
00:02:27,285 --> 00:02:30,855
I posted solutions, by the way. Shall we go?

4
00:02:31,155 --> 00:02:41,895
Okay. So if I find that most people have difficulty with a certain problem or an aspect of the problem, I will basically curb it.

5
00:02:43,305 --> 00:02:46,325
So I won't. Deduct any points.

6
00:02:48,915 --> 00:02:54,555
So the triangle thing. So we had, uh, basically a distribution.

7
00:02:55,765 --> 00:02:59,575
Yeah, right. That had a PDF that looked like this.

8
00:03:02,405 --> 00:03:06,305
So correct me if I'm wrong, because I I'm just using my memory.

9
00:03:08,535 --> 00:03:18,105
Oh, what the problem was. So that's the PDF.

10
00:03:19,745 --> 00:03:32,555
Well. Let's see if it works. So then we essentially specified another random variable that's a function of X.

11
00:03:41,315 --> 00:03:43,955
That means it's defined on the same sigma algebra.

12
00:03:45,305 --> 00:03:52,445
So it's not a surprise that variables defined on the same sigma algebra are functions of each other.

13
00:03:53,135 --> 00:04:10,325
It was a binary function that was one where an X is between zero and E and zero when X was from a two to a right.

14
00:04:11,435 --> 00:04:15,935
So we have a continuous distribution, so it doesn't matter.

15
00:04:16,175 --> 00:04:21,245
But just for purity. So one of the A's needs to be excluded.

16
00:04:21,605 --> 00:04:31,475
Is that it? Is that how it sounded? Okay. So, yeah, and we want, uh, expectation of, um, x given Y.

17
00:04:33,215 --> 00:04:41,345
Now, first of all, uh. Now we know that these in this context, right?

18
00:04:41,395 --> 00:04:48,715
This is going to be a similar function, uh, just like the Y, except that the values will be different.

19
00:04:48,985 --> 00:04:52,165
Right. So that's that's what we.

20
00:04:56,635 --> 00:05:03,205
Because by definition that's going to be measurable with respect to sigma algebra generated by Y.

21
00:05:03,805 --> 00:05:12,985
So Y has two constant values on two different sets, and those sets are defined as X of zero.

22
00:05:15,295 --> 00:05:19,465
So just using our previous annotations.

23
00:05:19,525 --> 00:05:26,994
So this is when Omega belongs to X minus one of the interval, which doesn't matter, right?

24
00:05:26,995 --> 00:05:33,904
So this is kind of. But seeing how the capital on it is defined.

25
00:05:33,905 --> 00:05:49,925
And we don't need it here. But if we want to be expressed, why is a function of Omega rather than the function of x?

26
00:05:49,925 --> 00:05:54,335
So this is how it's going to look like, right? That's an equivalence statement.

27
00:05:55,295 --> 00:05:58,515
So then so we have one value here.

28
00:05:58,535 --> 00:06:01,815
One value here under the same conditions.

29
00:06:01,835 --> 00:06:12,695
Right. X belongs to. Zero a.

30
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:22,015
And X belongs to A to a.

31
00:06:23,905 --> 00:06:32,515
Right. So again, based on what I wrote on the right, this notation X belongs to something is really a set of lawmakers in this sense it.

32
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:44,795
So you could call it set E and set B. So you could call this A, these guy B or a compliment for.

33
00:06:52,735 --> 00:06:54,444
Okay. So regarding values.

34
00:06:54,445 --> 00:07:06,535
So I know that the values of my conditional expectation will be averages over the set of X, over the sets A and A with a bar.

35
00:07:06,805 --> 00:07:12,515
Right. Conditional expectations there. So that's the general statement, right?

36
00:07:13,415 --> 00:07:23,565
So the value. So we need to call this conditional expectation somehow.

37
00:07:23,775 --> 00:07:29,665
Let's let's call it Z. Right. So I will then have two values.

38
00:07:29,695 --> 00:07:37,285
So value of the Z on the selfie and the value of the Z on the complement.

39
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:43,584
Right. So the A is going to be good here and the complement is good.

40
00:07:43,585 --> 00:07:48,865
I go here. Writing to, for example, Z.

41
00:07:48,865 --> 00:07:53,625
A he is going to be an integral role.

42
00:07:53,675 --> 00:08:06,035
So here is the general expression right of x pdf of x the x over.

43
00:08:07,895 --> 00:08:14,765
And this is over the city. And in the girl over the set a f of x de x.

44
00:08:14,825 --> 00:08:18,155
Right. This is what the conditional expectation.

45
00:08:21,655 --> 00:08:31,395
Of X given he looks like great. So this is this structure of conditional expectation of X given the Y, right?

46
00:08:31,935 --> 00:08:35,445
Because Y is discrete, takes constant values, and they.

47
00:08:36,075 --> 00:08:39,925
So those values are the ones that best approximates, uh.

48
00:08:41,225 --> 00:08:51,775
The function y uh, the, the function acts on those sets and these approximating values are conditional expectations for X given they.

49
00:08:53,265 --> 00:09:03,525
Okay. So my e is, uh, from zero to E, so I can just replace it like this.

50
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:17,865
In order to find out what the sea is, I need to find the F of x.

51
00:09:18,265 --> 00:09:26,175
Right. Now just visually, I know that it's going to look like this.

52
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:30,765
So this is my pile right there, and I need to balance it on this sense.

53
00:09:31,605 --> 00:09:36,105
I have two sets, right? I have an E, which is this one?

54
00:09:41,175 --> 00:09:44,695
And I have a complement, which is my second triangle.

55
00:09:45,545 --> 00:09:53,784
Right. And just intuitively so my balance will be not in the middle, but shifted somewhat because the mass is kind of growing.

56
00:09:53,785 --> 00:09:58,465
Right. So this one will balanced my first triangle.

57
00:10:01,415 --> 00:10:06,695
And for the second one, I am actually not interested in it.

58
00:10:10,075 --> 00:10:16,985
Uh. Because my, uh. So let's let's do the first one.

59
00:10:20,725 --> 00:10:27,614
So I need to know. What's this point?

60
00:10:27,615 --> 00:10:31,055
This right to define the pdf, I need the formula for that pdf.

61
00:10:32,385 --> 00:10:41,175
So. And what's given to me? So the symmetric two triangles, if I flip one of them, it's going to make a square.

62
00:10:41,355 --> 00:10:54,315
Right. So this thing is going to be a square with A and B, if I flip one of the triangles,

63
00:10:54,465 --> 00:11:02,175
put them like this right in the area of that square will be the same as the area under my pdf.

64
00:11:09,805 --> 00:11:17,095
So area and the pdf is going to be equal to eight times B, right.

65
00:11:19,485 --> 00:11:24,015
Because of this. That's the area of this square, and it needs to be one.

66
00:11:26,035 --> 00:11:29,785
So from there I'm getting that my BS actually won over he.

67
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:41,205
So I have one over here. So now how is X look like if I have it like this, right?

68
00:11:43,515 --> 00:11:46,545
So I have won over a and I have a.

69
00:11:48,305 --> 00:11:58,185
So the tangent here is what's one over a divided by a.

70
00:11:59,675 --> 00:12:02,965
So that's my. Angle. Right.

71
00:12:02,965 --> 00:12:06,115
And it's one over a square. Right.

72
00:12:07,045 --> 00:12:11,665
Yeah. My function there is linear. There's no intercept because it starts at zero.

73
00:12:12,505 --> 00:12:18,235
So I can right then is x of a square.

74
00:12:26,655 --> 00:12:38,425
Okay. So then I know. So then I need an integral from zero to a.

75
00:12:41,285 --> 00:12:48,665
X times f of x is x over e squared the x.

76
00:12:49,385 --> 00:13:04,875
That's my numerator of this a. And this he's well one over e squared and then I have, uh, x23.

77
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:14,755
All three and taken between zero and E, right.

78
00:13:21,565 --> 00:13:28,015
And that's eas two three or four e squared over three.

79
00:13:32,975 --> 00:13:38,525
This is what he three. Okay.

80
00:13:39,605 --> 00:13:43,415
So then in the denominator I have zero to a.

81
00:13:44,635 --> 00:13:47,815
X over a square Dix.

82
00:13:51,155 --> 00:13:54,815
So that's just the probability, right?

83
00:13:54,895 --> 00:14:04,165
Um. So you could say what this is right away, but we can also take an girl.

84
00:14:04,555 --> 00:14:09,884
So that's six squared over two. Times Square.

85
00:14:09,885 --> 00:14:13,245
It's taken between zero and E.

86
00:14:14,235 --> 00:14:17,625
So that's a square over to a square.

87
00:14:18,015 --> 00:14:23,925
That's one half. Right. And it was clear from the very beginning is we are just.

88
00:14:26,205 --> 00:14:31,904
Calculating this probability. That's the area and it's symmetric distribution.

89
00:14:31,905 --> 00:14:35,355
So this is. Just one half.

90
00:14:35,565 --> 00:14:44,255
Right. And so this means my Z is a over three.

91
00:14:47,115 --> 00:14:50,775
Right divided by one or two.

92
00:14:50,955 --> 00:14:54,545
So it's two thirds of me. Right.

93
00:14:54,555 --> 00:15:02,975
So it's not in the middle. It's it's two thirds. And this is a.

94
00:15:10,605 --> 00:15:24,885
And there is a similar exercise for the other. I don't remember how it altered the solution.

95
00:15:24,885 --> 00:15:26,775
They may have written a zero, but that's wrong.

96
00:15:28,195 --> 00:15:37,195
So there's got to be a simple exercise for the other half because it doesn't matter what the values of Y are when you are solving it,

97
00:15:37,435 --> 00:15:43,525
because what y gives you is just the structure of the sigma algebra and nothing else doesn't matter.

98
00:15:44,035 --> 00:15:49,565
And the conditional expectation is averages of X, not averages of Y.

99
00:15:51,435 --> 00:15:58,455
All of the sets. So the values of why does not. Modify the answer in any way.

100
00:15:58,935 --> 00:16:04,945
Only the sense that. Why generates in the sigma algebra.

101
00:16:06,485 --> 00:16:20,665
The questions. If I made it somehow symmetric.

102
00:16:20,845 --> 00:16:25,255
Right. Let's see if I gave you something like this.

103
00:16:29,395 --> 00:16:33,395
That looks more complicated.

104
00:16:35,605 --> 00:16:46,815
But it's actually simpler. So this is to a this is a this is a over two.

105
00:16:48,225 --> 00:16:56,675
And this is what. Oh, three or four times a year.

106
00:16:56,695 --> 00:17:05,305
Right. So under the same scenario.

107
00:17:05,305 --> 00:17:09,235
So what would be expected value of x?

108
00:17:09,235 --> 00:17:17,325
Given Y? Anybody want to try?

109
00:17:20,655 --> 00:17:25,515
You don't need to take any integrals here because they have symmetry.

110
00:17:26,835 --> 00:17:31,675
It's what? So there are two values, right?

111
00:17:32,565 --> 00:17:37,995
The GM and this one will be when X is between zero and the.

112
00:17:40,335 --> 00:17:46,485
So we're excluding it. And this is it's between a into a.

113
00:17:49,475 --> 00:17:55,955
Eight over two. That's right for this one, because that's the point that gives the balance right for the first half.

114
00:17:56,375 --> 00:18:01,735
And the point that gives balance to the second half is. Three over two times.

115
00:18:01,845 --> 00:18:20,645
He writes, It's immediate. No, no algebra. Okay.

116
00:18:20,915 --> 00:18:34,415
So and I'll talk more. So once I've gone through all of your exams, I'll catch things that present a difficulty and we will discuss them again.

117
00:18:34,565 --> 00:18:38,285
So the solutions I posted that tentative. I will update them.

118
00:18:40,065 --> 00:18:47,685
Correcting both my mistakes and putting perhaps stuff you have in the solution that I did not think about.

119
00:18:52,185 --> 00:19:00,645
Okay. So let's see.

120
00:19:01,185 --> 00:19:05,025
Let's recall. So the lecture before we had the midterm.

121
00:19:06,135 --> 00:19:16,965
What was that about? So we had the monotone convergence theorem.

122
00:19:20,765 --> 00:19:27,505
That was kind of an extension of a calculus result. Then.

123
00:19:27,805 --> 00:19:35,355
So a very important thing on uh, uh, you measurable functions that you can basically.

124
00:19:36,405 --> 00:19:43,785
Uh, treaties, Constance under the expectation sign or pull of them out, the variables that are you measurable.

125
00:19:46,775 --> 00:20:04,445
Then. So we had the properties of uh, uh, finally in the general case, the properties of projection.

126
00:20:04,755 --> 00:20:14,595
So this is not the most general case. So you may have noticed that, uh, so in the context of conditional expectation and also some other stuff,

127
00:20:15,015 --> 00:20:18,135
we are already talking about multiple random variables.

128
00:20:19,145 --> 00:20:33,855
Right. And uh, so the example so far, the practical stuff was when one variable is a function of another, uh, we basically say when X and Y.

129
00:20:37,275 --> 00:20:49,455
So X was measurable with respect to some sigma algebra F and Y was measurable with respect to some sigma algebra you.

130
00:20:50,025 --> 00:20:53,775
And in the practical example, we were thinking that you is part of F.

131
00:20:56,125 --> 00:21:02,385
In practice. Problems so far.

132
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:16,425
Right. So we also had a definition for conditional expectation,

133
00:21:16,905 --> 00:21:26,625
which was that the integral of X over sets a is the same is and then the growth of Y over sets a.

134
00:21:29,485 --> 00:21:35,545
Right. And that was for an A in the you write and the why is.

135
00:21:38,225 --> 00:21:51,275
You measurable. And we're talking about conditional expectations of x given the sigma algebra you.

136
00:21:54,905 --> 00:21:59,135
So it's a you measurable function. Um.

137
00:21:59,915 --> 00:22:08,045
Right. So what do we have here? So we have y, uh, being a you measurable function.

138
00:22:28,545 --> 00:22:31,925
So this was the the definition. Okay.

139
00:22:32,415 --> 00:22:39,615
And so in practice, this does not have to be the case.

140
00:22:41,245 --> 00:22:44,405
Uh, because we had a probability space.

141
00:22:44,415 --> 00:22:51,045
I mean, the if and some measure p defined on that probability space.

142
00:22:51,695 --> 00:22:57,765
Yeah. And up to now, uh, we kind of consider that as a univariate thing, right?

143
00:22:58,455 --> 00:23:05,865
So long ago was it could be a real ly and so f could be a sigma algebra but sets

144
00:23:05,955 --> 00:23:11,055
on the real line that's p is is kind of a probability measure in one target.

145
00:23:11,055 --> 00:23:21,585
Not right. But when we can see the random variables. Um, so in this case it works and I can do with the univariate space is you is just the part of f,

146
00:23:22,575 --> 00:23:30,645
um, but um, so in general, uh, so you could tell me that I can have two arbitrary random variables.

147
00:23:30,685 --> 00:23:33,285
I can define the probability space for each of them.

148
00:23:34,005 --> 00:23:40,935
They don't have to be included in one another, uh, because we know we have joint distributions and so on.

149
00:23:40,935 --> 00:23:45,795
So today we'll talk about the multivariate extension of this understanding.

150
00:23:46,215 --> 00:23:50,385
We won't go again over all the derivations because they are all going to be valid.

151
00:23:51,255 --> 00:23:59,055
Um, with the understanding that our integrals over a will be multidimensional, right?

152
00:23:59,065 --> 00:24:04,455
That I have to run the variables. This would be double integrals as a p.

153
00:24:04,935 --> 00:24:14,355
Uh, so in case I have two variables will actually measure, uh, the, uh, probabilities of rectangles, right?

154
00:24:14,355 --> 00:24:21,945
Where, uh, uh. So it's a product of Cartesian product of two intervals.

155
00:24:21,945 --> 00:24:23,545
So we'll talk more about that. Right?

156
00:24:23,905 --> 00:24:30,835
So we'll extend this setting without changing anything just to endow conditional expectations with a general meaning.

157
00:24:31,165 --> 00:24:35,875
And we'll also use the opportunity to introduce the notion of independence.

158
00:24:36,885 --> 00:24:43,675
Uh, and most of it will be done without proof. Okay.

159
00:24:45,585 --> 00:24:56,535
So in the last lecture before exam, so we proved the general property is the analogy and the minimal distance.

160
00:24:57,255 --> 00:25:03,915
And like I said, they are all going to be valid with the understanding that I may have x y.

161
00:25:05,365 --> 00:25:10,265
Kind of, uh, forming, uh, random vector here.

162
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:14,125
And I have a two dimensional. Probability space.

163
00:25:14,275 --> 00:25:22,195
So that's also going to work. And the last thing we did was kind of a note in passing, um, on the formula for,

164
00:25:22,765 --> 00:25:27,595
of total expectation for the variance rates formula of total variance.

165
00:25:29,855 --> 00:25:40,485
And that was it. Okay. So now after the lecture today, probably the next one.

166
00:25:41,205 --> 00:25:47,205
So we will eventually start looking at convergence. We are approaching statistics more and more.

167
00:25:47,415 --> 00:25:54,945
Right. And for statistics, we have a notion of consistency, of an estimate and strong consistency of an estimate.

168
00:25:55,575 --> 00:26:03,045
So these are essentially statistical names for the probability of a minor.

169
00:26:03,055 --> 00:26:06,135
That's called convergence of sequences of random variables.

170
00:26:07,255 --> 00:26:14,445
Right. And we will have convergence and probability and convergence, almost surely, that are behind those names.

171
00:26:14,475 --> 00:26:24,735
Right. So consistency period is convergence and probability of an estimate to the true value of the parameter.

172
00:26:25,395 --> 00:26:33,735
And almost sure, convergence is convergence with probability one now to a value of parameter.

173
00:26:34,425 --> 00:26:37,725
Uh, so will consider different types of convergence.

174
00:26:37,725 --> 00:26:43,155
And also when convergence is not necessarily to a constant but to a limiting variable.

175
00:26:44,385 --> 00:26:50,205
And that's going to matter for the other part of statistics, because when you have a new estimate,

176
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:55,395
you first establish consistency and then you establish asymptotic properties, right?

177
00:26:55,395 --> 00:26:58,824
The same thing, a distribution like normality of your estimate.

178
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:02,565
So that's also a convergence. And most important one,

179
00:27:02,565 --> 00:27:12,195
there will be not the strong versions of it like convergence and probability and even stronger convergence with probability one.

180
00:27:12,705 --> 00:27:16,545
Uh, but a weaker type of convergence. It's called weak convergence.

181
00:27:17,265 --> 00:27:23,485
Uh, so that's what happens for. Uh, of the asymptotic distribution.

182
00:27:24,265 --> 00:27:33,625
Uh, but in order to establish the connections between different types of convergence, I will need probability inequalities.

183
00:27:33,625 --> 00:27:43,305
And you may remember from 601 that uh, uh, something like a champions of inequality, uh, was used to establish consistency, right?

184
00:27:43,305 --> 00:27:48,385
Or the result that if variance goes to zero, then you have consistency.

185
00:27:51,505 --> 00:28:01,315
So let's briefly look at, uh, the, there's a great number of qualities that are useful in different circumstances with,

186
00:28:01,975 --> 00:28:08,275
uh, just barely scratching the surface on them. Um, this will call improved.

187
00:28:10,875 --> 00:28:22,205
Mark of inequality. And we'll use the.

188
00:28:23,495 --> 00:28:31,575
This result is. Uh, so as a corollary to it, we will have both the microphone, the inequality and the championship for the quality.

189
00:28:31,595 --> 00:28:34,775
There are actually virtually the same thing.

190
00:28:35,465 --> 00:28:42,425
You know, the inequality looks like this. So the probability of x greater equal x.

191
00:28:43,535 --> 00:28:48,275
And so we can do the conditional one because it doesn't cost us anything.

192
00:28:49,325 --> 00:28:59,615
Uh, because all the derivations are going to be similar to the one without the U except that the result is very, uh, is valid, almost truly.

193
00:29:00,665 --> 00:29:05,495
Uh, because conditioning on you makes the probability you have the variable, right?

194
00:29:07,425 --> 00:29:10,815
So it's less equal to expectation.

195
00:29:12,645 --> 00:29:24,195
X times indicator x greater equal x given you and this is divided over x.

196
00:29:36,085 --> 00:29:44,395
So let's move this thing. Let's first show the graph of the indicator function.

197
00:29:46,895 --> 00:29:51,195
That's. I have an x axis.

198
00:29:51,965 --> 00:30:05,345
I have the small x somewhere here. No, my ex greater than the ex is going to be here and my indicator functions.

199
00:30:12,825 --> 00:30:18,465
He's going to be zero until this point and then it's going to jump to one.

200
00:30:20,645 --> 00:30:26,525
So this is indicator x greater equal x, right?

201
00:30:27,005 --> 00:30:33,905
And when my x is equal to the small x, this is actually already one.

202
00:30:34,715 --> 00:30:40,085
So then it's right. Continuous. Just like the CDF.

203
00:30:41,225 --> 00:30:48,305
Okay. So I am going to design a function that's larger than this one.

204
00:30:50,125 --> 00:30:59,725
Because I need to replace x greater equal x by a larger function, uh, to establish this inequality.

205
00:31:00,085 --> 00:31:03,655
And I will do this one. So it's going to be zero.

206
00:31:05,155 --> 00:31:09,265
It's going to behave in a similar way with indicator.

207
00:31:09,265 --> 00:31:17,725
Then it's going to jump just like the indicator. But starting from this point, uh, it's going to linearly increase.

208
00:31:24,055 --> 00:31:34,685
Okay. And then I'll replace the. Probability that I have by the expectation of an indicator.

209
00:31:49,425 --> 00:31:53,285
It looks great. It works. Right?

210
00:31:53,295 --> 00:32:03,495
And then I need the inequality up for the indicator function that will make it generally larger than the indicator.

211
00:32:08,085 --> 00:32:15,705
Right. And like I said, it behaves the same way as the indicator where x is less than the x is equal to zero.

212
00:32:18,245 --> 00:32:22,375
And. So when I have.

213
00:32:25,665 --> 00:32:32,365
It's in the so the this part. Of the line.

214
00:32:32,525 --> 00:32:40,535
I call it the x over x. X divided.

215
00:32:46,025 --> 00:32:51,165
Which one was using? This one.

216
00:32:53,435 --> 00:32:57,155
When X is greater equal x.

217
00:32:58,885 --> 00:33:08,835
This is going to be it. So, yes. So when my X is equal to the small one.

218
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:13,305
Right, I'm getting these points. Uh, x one.

219
00:33:14,375 --> 00:33:23,645
So it looks like what I show on the graph, it starts at the point x one and then linearly increases at the rate of one over x.

220
00:33:25,305 --> 00:33:30,645
So this is one of the angles. Tensions.

221
00:33:33,085 --> 00:33:40,225
Okay. So then the the my goal is to now substituted.

222
00:33:43,875 --> 00:33:47,025
For. They indicate and say that this is less than equal.

223
00:33:47,055 --> 00:34:01,035
I expect that the value of zero x is less than x x x x is greater equal x.

224
00:34:02,545 --> 00:34:08,435
This is giving you. Then.

225
00:34:08,745 --> 00:34:15,145
So how? Let's tidy up this curvy bracket.

226
00:34:15,325 --> 00:34:22,135
Right. So I have x over x, except when my x is less than x.

227
00:34:23,335 --> 00:34:27,625
So I could say that this is x or x and I need to make it zero.

228
00:34:28,015 --> 00:34:31,435
When x is less than x, I can multiply it by indicator.

229
00:34:36,315 --> 00:34:40,335
Um. Yeah.

230
00:34:40,425 --> 00:34:52,525
It's great. The equal x rate. Then when my ex is less than the ex, then indicator is going to make zero value.

231
00:34:52,525 --> 00:34:57,385
Otherwise it's going to be equal to x or y because just like the curvy bracket is C.

232
00:34:59,175 --> 00:35:07,615
Right. So I finally have expected value of x over x times indicator.

233
00:35:08,655 --> 00:35:12,305
X critical x. Given you.

234
00:35:14,475 --> 00:35:19,815
And this is just what we wanted to show because I can take X out.

235
00:35:21,295 --> 00:35:30,055
And. It's one of X.

236
00:35:31,675 --> 00:35:37,525
Expected to value X. Times indicate.

237
00:35:40,525 --> 00:35:47,475
Critical X given you. Okay.

238
00:35:47,835 --> 00:35:54,555
So I called it improved Markov because the usual Markov is without this indicator function.

239
00:35:55,125 --> 00:35:59,865
Now, of course, if I delete this indicator function, I will make it even larger than it is.

240
00:35:59,955 --> 00:36:04,455
Right? So it's certainly going to be valid. And we can write that there's a corollary.

241
00:36:07,595 --> 00:36:15,575
But often times. And it'll actually make the inequality worse if I delete the indicator.

242
00:36:15,585 --> 00:36:18,585
So this is a more accurate one.

243
00:36:18,975 --> 00:36:25,845
And oftentimes it's. This sharpness is just what is needed to establish things.

244
00:36:26,675 --> 00:36:32,975
And I remember. So in our assignments, uh, we will.

245
00:36:34,705 --> 00:36:44,635
Have problems where it matters, right? So where the the traditional markets inequality doesn't do it, but the improved one works.

246
00:36:47,435 --> 00:36:58,525
So. So one is a mark of inequality without the growth part.

247
00:37:09,595 --> 00:37:14,965
So I have x over x times indicator of whatever.

248
00:37:15,975 --> 00:37:22,635
Right. That actually doesn't matter what it is. It's going to be less equal than X over x.

249
00:37:26,305 --> 00:37:35,065
Yeah. I'm from there. I have the probability of x grade to equal x given you it's going to be less of

250
00:37:35,065 --> 00:37:42,085
equal expected value of x given to you without the indicator eight divided by x.

251
00:37:42,805 --> 00:37:49,025
So this is what's called Markov inequality. So Markov is the same guy who.

252
00:37:51,145 --> 00:37:59,494
Gave a name to a mark of processes. No.

253
00:37:59,495 --> 00:38:12,605
The second one. Now the the value of this in the qualities for consistency, convergence and stuff like that is because they, uh,

254
00:38:12,985 --> 00:38:23,235
link the probability of, uh, becoming large or deviating from its mean value if they are linking it to a variance.

255
00:38:23,275 --> 00:38:30,385
And this is what the championship inequality does. So we'll see variance in the formula right now.

256
00:38:30,385 --> 00:38:33,565
Right. It's just an expected value of X.

257
00:38:33,595 --> 00:38:37,945
Now for the variance, we need x squared. So.

258
00:38:39,955 --> 00:38:48,685
And the key to converting this formula, this inequality to an expression that would include variance,

259
00:38:49,315 --> 00:38:56,515
is a consideration that if I act on both sides of the inequality,

260
00:38:57,215 --> 00:39:05,965
uh, here and the probability, for example, by a function that's strictly increasing and not negative, my inequality won't change.

261
00:39:10,385 --> 00:39:18,995
Okay. So. Let's say I have f of x, uh, being non-negative.

262
00:39:21,425 --> 00:39:36,715
It's strictly increased. Then the inequality grades are equal.

263
00:39:36,715 --> 00:39:44,335
X is equivalent to the F of x, greater equal F of the smaller one.

264
00:39:46,905 --> 00:39:50,775
Then I can write the probability.

265
00:39:52,615 --> 00:40:01,515
Uh. So I have. I am replacing the inequality by the one that invokes the function f.

266
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:12,265
And it's less equal. So I have expected value.

267
00:40:13,315 --> 00:40:21,975
So I'm using the marker form here. So without the indicator, not the improved one.

268
00:40:25,145 --> 00:40:33,305
Of F of x, for example. Right then this guy is equivalent to x, greater equal x.

269
00:40:38,455 --> 00:40:41,745
Right. So I can write. It's a girl.

270
00:40:44,455 --> 00:40:54,595
Yes, the probability is greater equal x giving you these less equal expected value.

271
00:40:57,435 --> 00:41:03,465
F of x given you. Of X rate.

272
00:41:07,045 --> 00:41:15,414
And I see that in this expression, I can actually convert the right parts to uh, uh,

273
00:41:15,415 --> 00:41:22,855
generate a variance there if I take, uh, uh, if there's a square with some here, right.

274
00:41:25,345 --> 00:41:31,485
So let's do the third one. And it's what is known as Jeb Bush's.

275
00:41:33,145 --> 00:41:52,225
The quality. So my new X will be my old x minus mil and an absolute value of it.

276
00:41:53,095 --> 00:41:56,215
So that would make it the negative random variable.

277
00:41:59,335 --> 00:42:10,615
Then my function F of x is going to be x squared and I am only interested in x greater equals zero.

278
00:42:11,755 --> 00:42:18,855
So on this uh, x greater equals zero, it is strictly increasing.

279
00:42:30,705 --> 00:42:38,375
Right. So it's just this part of the function. So I squared.

280
00:42:43,445 --> 00:42:53,375
Okay then. So if I go back to the inequality, so I will have what's the probability that my new x,

281
00:42:53,375 --> 00:43:02,435
which is x minus mil, greater equal small x given you it's going to be less or equal.

282
00:43:02,465 --> 00:43:06,815
I expect that the value of so f is x squared.

283
00:43:06,815 --> 00:43:11,225
The x is my new x, so that's x minus mil squared.

284
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:19,675
And divided by. So F is x squared like this, right?

285
00:43:20,935 --> 00:43:26,815
And we just noticed that the thing in the numerator is just the variance of my.

286
00:43:27,945 --> 00:43:32,805
Old X. They should know you.

287
00:43:34,765 --> 00:43:39,715
Over X squared. This is known as the curvature from the quality.

288
00:43:45,115 --> 00:43:56,605
So we now see that if the variance is going to zero, then they need to be shown off from the mean values becoming increasingly unlikely right,

289
00:43:57,355 --> 00:44:00,925
because the right path will be zero and this probability will go to zero.

290
00:44:01,795 --> 00:44:06,955
And it's actually almost the definition for convergence in probability.

291
00:44:07,585 --> 00:44:10,805
Right. We will define it as this thing.

292
00:44:12,065 --> 00:44:20,014
I'm going to zero. Eventually.

293
00:44:20,015 --> 00:44:32,465
So this was the inequalities. They.

294
00:44:32,605 --> 00:44:36,215
And so the next thing is multivariable.

295
00:44:42,375 --> 00:44:43,905
Probability spaces.

296
00:44:52,345 --> 00:45:03,305
In this topic I would give without proof just to spare some time and proofs are fairly technical and belong more to mathematics than.

297
00:45:05,695 --> 00:45:14,415
What we are dealing with right now. Not that it's difficult.

298
00:45:15,145 --> 00:45:21,065
So this is just to save time. For some statistics at the end of the course.

299
00:45:22,715 --> 00:45:26,075
Okay, let's do a break. Five minute break.

300
00:47:39,585 --> 00:47:44,815
Cause. So the way we did it. It's not all.

301
00:47:45,115 --> 00:47:50,495
It's not a wax. It's F of x. See.

302
00:47:51,605 --> 00:51:55,065
Several things. Right? Uh huh. Okay.

303
00:51:55,365 --> 00:52:04,425
Shall we continue? So I corrected my mistake in the solution because I think I originally had it as zero here.

304
00:52:06,195 --> 00:52:12,075
Certainly not zero. So it's another point of balance, but since it's just the flipped picture to the first one,

305
00:52:12,795 --> 00:52:20,625
it's going to be one third here and two thirds here of the cells in is just 4/3 of the.

306
00:52:22,025 --> 00:52:34,025
First one. Yeah. Uh huh.

307
00:52:45,355 --> 00:52:48,805
Of course. Of course. Yeah. So.

308
00:52:48,835 --> 00:52:56,225
So if you remember the well, mechanics of physics and how you find the center of mass by mass.

309
00:52:56,425 --> 00:53:02,275
Right. And if you remember that for a triangle, it's one third of with two thirds.

310
00:53:02,275 --> 00:53:08,825
Right. If this is a triangle with 90 degrees here, then you could just put it in.

311
00:53:08,845 --> 00:53:15,895
Right. I'd be okay if you don't integrate and just show me that this is a point of balance and I will

312
00:53:15,895 --> 00:53:23,435
trust you will eventually be able to calculate it when you refresh your physics every time.

313
00:53:24,535 --> 00:53:30,595
So I'm not after the algebra like this at all for any time after the understanding of basic things here.

314
00:53:33,325 --> 00:53:42,865
So if you write it as an integral and just drop it, that's fine. Okay.

315
00:53:42,865 --> 00:53:47,665
So where is my lecture? There it is.

316
00:53:52,615 --> 00:53:55,915
Okay. Um, multivariate probability spaces.

317
00:53:57,535 --> 00:54:06,685
So, uh, this is, uh, to some extent the repetition of the discussion you had in 601 about the joint distributions.

318
00:54:07,555 --> 00:54:12,595
Uh, but this time with Sigma Algebras and all the bells and whistles.

319
00:54:12,805 --> 00:54:19,765
Right. Yeah. The first, uh, we, uh, define Cartesian product.

320
00:54:28,065 --> 00:54:36,165
Offsets. This is conceptually similar to the outer product that you know from leaving the algebra.

321
00:54:37,365 --> 00:54:40,665
Right. The turns, for example, two vectors into a matrix.

322
00:54:41,865 --> 00:54:48,705
So what happens is that you have accountable set right with a finite set of values, which is what the vector is.

323
00:54:49,185 --> 00:55:02,865
And another countable set with it is a second vector. And when you do, uh, outer product, the, you have essentially, uh, the matrix of values, right?

324
00:55:02,865 --> 00:55:07,424
So we have a much bigger set, a square set instead of a line set.

325
00:55:07,425 --> 00:55:14,055
So here is the same thing. Um, so if I have, uh, I will first define it for pairs.

326
00:55:14,235 --> 00:55:17,925
So let's say I have two sets, e one and the two.

327
00:55:21,455 --> 00:55:27,145
So any $0.02 in any of the context there?

328
00:55:28,085 --> 00:55:31,595
So we define a Cartesian product.

329
00:55:31,595 --> 00:56:00,575
So this is notation. With E two is actually a set of pairs a18 to.

330
00:56:03,795 --> 00:56:08,505
When a one year and a one.

331
00:56:09,405 --> 00:56:13,665
And a two year and a two.

332
00:56:20,175 --> 00:56:23,985
And I'll put all pairs. Right.

333
00:56:24,735 --> 00:56:34,004
So this is how it's defined. It's basically taking all elements from A1 one and each of them combine with all

334
00:56:34,005 --> 00:56:41,385
elements from E two and collect the pairs that are happening in this exercise.

335
00:56:41,715 --> 00:56:43,695
Um, so as an example.

336
00:56:51,225 --> 00:57:04,095
So let's say I have this map, which is an interval from A to B, and I'm building a Cartesian product with an interval from C to D.

337
00:57:06,705 --> 00:57:24,115
Uh. What's going to happen? So if I may have, um.

338
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:29,095
So I will have pairs, right. Uh, from the.

339
00:57:29,105 --> 00:57:39,145
This is my said a one. This is my sad E too, and I can interpret elements of this set.

340
00:57:40,385 --> 00:57:45,995
So these will be a one and e two belonging to these sets.

341
00:57:47,375 --> 00:57:50,585
Right. And my pair e one and e two.

342
00:57:51,545 --> 00:58:07,305
I will consider it as a vector. So I will do these manipulations in order to be able to show it graphically.

343
00:58:08,555 --> 00:58:18,544
Right. So then the Cartesian product is a set of all vectors whose components whose first

344
00:58:18,545 --> 00:58:23,195
component falls between A and B and second component falls between C and D.

345
00:58:28,575 --> 00:58:38,445
So this is the first component. There's a second component of my vectors.

346
00:58:40,275 --> 00:58:49,065
And the first falls between A and B and second falls between C and D.

347
00:58:54,655 --> 00:58:58,375
So the Cartesian product is on points inside the square.

348
00:58:58,855 --> 00:59:01,915
Well, it's not a square rectangle.

349
00:59:08,345 --> 00:59:13,085
Right. So a Caucasian product of two intervals is is a rectangle.

350
00:59:13,975 --> 00:59:19,715
If I do it in a multivariate fashion, right. Do a Cartesian product of more than two intervals.

351
00:59:19,745 --> 00:59:25,955
Well, it's going to be a cube if I have three of them. And the multi dimensional cube in general.

352
00:59:30,505 --> 00:59:40,585
So this definition. These extended.

353
00:59:47,665 --> 00:59:57,315
Two multivariable. Cartesian products.

354
01:00:07,375 --> 01:00:18,785
So it's when I have multiple sets. Right.

355
01:00:19,385 --> 01:00:25,795
So then I will know if my sets are intervals.

356
01:00:25,805 --> 01:00:31,625
I will have. When he eyes.

357
01:00:32,985 --> 01:00:41,225
Uh, intervals. And in that case, I will denote those as, uh.

358
01:00:45,575 --> 01:00:49,435
By I is right.

359
01:00:49,595 --> 01:00:56,095
So I from interval. Then.

360
01:00:57,215 --> 01:01:00,815
So the. Product? I don't know.

361
01:01:00,815 --> 01:01:05,555
I don't have a notation for Cartesian product they'll keep.

362
01:01:07,045 --> 01:01:27,535
Writing it like this. He's a multi dimensional and dimensional, right?

363
01:01:31,365 --> 01:01:37,205
Can you? You are an.

364
01:01:48,485 --> 01:01:53,015
So then. So that's the first extension.

365
01:01:54,005 --> 01:02:11,785
Then can also be extended. 2 a.m. equals infinity, in which case I will have an infinity dimensional cube.

366
01:02:15,675 --> 01:02:21,744
A carrying out of it, but one that is still linked to components.

367
01:02:21,745 --> 01:02:26,545
Right? So elements of that space will be sequences of components, right?

368
01:02:27,115 --> 01:02:32,995
It's just like a vector that has infinitely big dimension, but it still has components, right?

369
01:02:33,025 --> 01:02:36,355
I can say what the third one is, what the fourth one is.

370
01:02:36,835 --> 01:02:41,565
So it's going to be accountable. Set of components.

371
01:02:41,895 --> 01:02:46,275
Right. But we can also extended to uncountable.

372
01:02:49,745 --> 01:02:57,155
So this will be infinite. Dimensional vectors.

373
01:03:00,925 --> 01:03:04,994
In our. Infinitely big.

374
01:03:04,995 --> 01:03:10,365
Great. But I can also extend this.

375
01:03:17,105 --> 01:03:28,645
Two uncountable. Sets of components.

376
01:03:34,725 --> 01:03:46,465
And those are functions. And then we will have a cube.

377
01:03:49,295 --> 01:03:51,005
In a functional space.

378
01:04:01,995 --> 01:04:15,015
I because if you generalize a vector so a vector, you can look at it as a function of an integer random variable with way integer random.

379
01:04:15,015 --> 01:04:18,045
They're not random variable integer variable.

380
01:04:18,255 --> 01:04:26,235
Right. So vector. x1x.

381
01:04:26,235 --> 01:04:31,075
And these. If.

382
01:04:32,335 --> 01:04:37,735
Of X, where x belongs to natural numbers.

383
01:04:40,855 --> 01:04:46,075
And if he is defined. And if his values.

384
01:04:53,455 --> 01:04:57,385
X. On numbers i.

385
01:05:02,385 --> 01:05:10,015
This is a useful understanding. Because you can represent the vector.

386
01:05:10,065 --> 01:05:17,224
So what is this function? So I have one to sew on up to here.

387
01:05:17,225 --> 01:05:21,235
And the graph of this function is something. Right.

388
01:05:23,265 --> 01:05:27,675
And these are values x, y, x to.

389
01:05:30,605 --> 01:05:38,195
This is in the middle is. This guy is x three and so on.

390
01:05:38,375 --> 01:05:51,855
Right. And if I want to generalize it into something smooth and uncountable as we're talking about the domain set for the function f uh,

391
01:05:51,935 --> 01:05:57,574
so we could say it's only natural. Instead of natural numbers, I have real numbers.

392
01:05:57,575 --> 01:06:03,325
Then they will have some kind of a function. That would be a generalization of a factor.

393
01:06:04,795 --> 01:06:10,435
And this intuition is behind the scale of products that we considered, by the way.

394
01:06:10,445 --> 01:06:18,355
So if you remember, so the scalar product of vectors were sums of products of their components,

395
01:06:19,285 --> 01:06:24,475
while for random variables we said that it's an expectation of a product of random variables.

396
01:06:25,255 --> 01:06:32,185
So if you use this intuition, you can see how one is actually a generalization like this of another.

397
01:06:37,995 --> 01:06:40,575
And this understanding is a useful one when you.

398
01:06:42,475 --> 01:06:48,774
Look at the expectations that are an extension essentially of linear apparatus from linear algebra, right?

399
01:06:48,775 --> 01:07:01,495
So in linear algebra we have matrices as linear operators and those are turned into integrals, uh, with this type of intuition.

400
01:07:03,365 --> 01:07:10,324
Okay. Um, and so functional spaces are needed not just for expectations and random variables,

401
01:07:10,325 --> 01:07:15,725
but when you want to characterize, for example, a sigma algebra associated with a process.

402
01:07:16,925 --> 01:07:21,275
So if you observe a stochastic process. So here is another example.

403
01:07:31,635 --> 01:07:41,065
The casting process. So processes are.

404
01:07:42,395 --> 01:07:47,285
Uh, compositions or friend. The variables indexed by time.

405
01:07:47,495 --> 01:07:54,725
Right. And in that sense. So when my time is in some interval.

406
01:07:55,085 --> 01:07:58,085
So this is an uncountable collection. Right.

407
01:07:58,805 --> 01:08:07,475
So I have each point is, is a random variable in itself with some correlation structure to it in general and so on.

408
01:08:07,475 --> 01:08:11,254
But it's not a vector. It's an infinite dimensional object.

409
01:08:11,255 --> 01:08:14,465
So it's actually a function of time, but it's a random function of time.

410
01:08:15,515 --> 01:08:22,865
So each component of this function is X with T D fixed, and that's a random variable in its own right.

411
01:08:23,735 --> 01:08:32,855
So, uh, and the trajectory of the process, well, let's say I have some kind of index of t that's.

412
01:08:36,445 --> 01:08:42,355
Trajectory of that process in general. Right. And I may be looking at, uh.

413
01:08:43,685 --> 01:08:45,275
Some specific points.

414
01:08:45,365 --> 01:09:00,694
T And asking the question, well, I want the sigma algebra generated by the collection of random variables that are x t when t is between zero and t.

415
01:09:00,695 --> 01:09:06,604
So the past of the process and I want to take a conditional expectation of the process

416
01:09:06,605 --> 01:09:11,705
over its future rate while protecting the past and making it a function of the past.

417
01:09:12,545 --> 01:09:17,295
So this is a common exercise. And for example,

418
01:09:17,295 --> 01:09:33,825
a noise process is defined in such a way that the expected value of a change from this point on in any interval after is zero conditional on the past.

419
01:09:34,875 --> 01:09:41,175
So that would be a noise process. And with some correlation structure, it would lead you to market gains, for example.

420
01:09:42,625 --> 01:09:45,835
And there are limits for these processes as well.

421
01:09:47,785 --> 01:09:54,055
So it's just the connection to. And Sigma algebra for them.

422
01:09:54,055 --> 01:10:04,205
Right. Would be generated by a curve. In general between zero and T and that would be a Cartesian product.

423
01:10:05,105 --> 01:10:11,605
Uh. Over uncountable. Uh. Number of members of the product, right.

424
01:10:13,335 --> 01:10:17,565
So it's really a pretty difficult thing to visualize.

425
01:10:19,065 --> 01:10:27,385
Okay. So. Now with this in mind, we can continue to probability spaces.

426
01:10:28,075 --> 01:10:31,885
So I can see that I have Omega.

427
01:10:32,955 --> 01:10:39,495
Defined by Cartesian product of ours, for example.

428
01:10:43,875 --> 01:10:54,045
And the components will be one, two, and so one. So then I'll have a multivariate omega, right where each element of that omega is generally a vector.

429
01:11:04,045 --> 01:11:09,625
But it's it's not a vector. It's it's an element of that multidimensional view.

430
01:11:28,205 --> 01:11:34,295
Q or. Are. Well, I don't know how to do.

431
01:11:39,175 --> 01:11:55,285
So that I can have barrel sigma algebra that is generated by open intervals a b in the univariate sense and I can have intervals.

432
01:11:58,445 --> 01:12:03,185
They are a key the case of each of the components.

433
01:12:03,605 --> 01:12:19,355
I have intervals and these would lead to the Burrell's Sigma algebra that's generated by open intervals related to one component.

434
01:12:22,785 --> 01:12:27,525
And then they can pay. Have the. Uh, BRL.

435
01:12:27,555 --> 01:12:32,385
And which is a Cartesian product of Burrelles.

436
01:12:32,595 --> 01:12:37,335
My Algebra one, three sigma algebra two.

437
01:12:39,535 --> 01:12:44,255
And so what? Where else?

438
01:12:44,645 --> 01:12:57,025
Algebra. And. Right.

439
01:12:57,055 --> 01:13:02,605
You can see how this can work. If I have, let's say, random variables that I am considering.

440
01:13:03,175 --> 01:13:09,975
Each of them has a barrel sigma algebra to it and the one I need for the joint thread.

441
01:13:09,985 --> 01:13:13,405
The variable will be the Cartesian product.

442
01:13:13,425 --> 01:13:29,215
5000. And so you can do it two ways.

443
01:13:29,545 --> 01:13:39,565
So you can construct. It's algebra.

444
01:13:42,935 --> 01:13:56,345
For every component. Or a random variable and then take Cartesian product.

445
01:14:06,575 --> 01:14:12,125
To give up the joint sigma algebra or you can construct.

446
01:14:14,545 --> 01:14:20,115
A joint. Uh, component.

447
01:14:24,365 --> 01:14:27,725
Of Cartesian product of intervals.

448
01:14:41,535 --> 01:14:44,655
And then generate the sigma algebra from those objects.

449
01:15:02,515 --> 01:15:08,875
From those multidimensional. Cubes.

450
01:15:12,755 --> 01:15:18,935
And again, without proof, there's a theorem that both procedures.

451
01:15:24,855 --> 01:15:27,855
Give the same joy and seek my algebra.

452
01:15:46,575 --> 01:15:55,835
Okay. So this is it for today. And next time we'll talk about independence.
