1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,129
So the second major theme I wanted to raise are policy options for

2
00:00:03,129 --> 00:00:04,368
addressing disparities.

3
00:00:04,368 --> 00:00:06,783
What can we do to improve coordination of care.

4
00:00:06,783 --> 00:00:09,354
Before speaking about how to improve it,

5
00:00:09,354 --> 00:00:14,359
want to just explain why fragmented systems of care contribute to disparities.

6
00:00:14,359 --> 00:00:18,594
We actually know if you open a medical journal nowadays,

7
00:00:18,594 --> 00:00:22,478
sometimes even newspapers, online news sources,

8
00:00:22,478 --> 00:00:26,731
you often see really educated, well connected people.

9
00:00:26,731 --> 00:00:30,894
Sometimes doctors and nurses talking about how they never understood how definite ir

10
00:00:30,894 --> 00:00:33,147
was to navigate our health system until they or

11
00:00:33,147 --> 00:00:35,840
a family member has serious health problem.

12
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,095
But typically what we see is these deficits affect all segments of society,

13
00:00:40,095 --> 00:00:44,483
but they tend to be more concentrated and have a bigger impact on non-white and

14
00:00:44,483 --> 00:00:47,840
low income patients for their systems structure.

15
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,426
And what happens is, in these complex systems of care the disadvantaged

16
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:53,208
patients fall through the cracks.

17
00:00:53,208 --> 00:00:58,313
And so we have multi-step complex process like treatment of heart disease or

18
00:00:58,313 --> 00:01:00,361
cancer or kidney transplant.

19
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,830
There's no one step that really explains the whole disparity and

20
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:09,518
from the very beginning of evaluation through the final treatment.

21
00:01:09,518 --> 00:01:13,975
What we see is sort of an accumulation of small disparities sometimes in each step

22
00:01:13,975 --> 00:01:17,800
the way they can choose to this moderate to large disparity overall.

23
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,961
Like we saw with access to kidney transplant.

24
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,721
And another important feature here is that these disparities arise even when

25
00:01:24,721 --> 00:01:26,470
providers are well intentioned.

26
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:31,215
So there's been a number of surveys over the past decade asking physicians

27
00:01:31,215 --> 00:01:35,451
whether there are health care disparities in our system at large.

28
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:41,183
Surveys of the majority now recognised and agreed that those disparities exist.

29
00:01:41,183 --> 00:01:45,360
And then they may be asked are the disparities in the community where you

30
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,940
practise.

31
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:51,032
it might be a bare majority or a little less than a majority would agree with that

32
00:01:51,032 --> 00:01:53,705
substantially lower than what we see nationally.

33
00:01:53,705 --> 00:01:57,024
And then if you ask if there's disparities in the group for

34
00:01:57,024 --> 00:02:01,227
their own clinical practise, relatively small minority, maybe 20 or

35
00:02:01,227 --> 00:02:05,451
30% typically recognise that they might have disparities practise.

36
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:11,101
And yet when we look at the practises and even those positions that don't perceived

37
00:02:11,101 --> 00:02:14,511
disparities, we tend to see them in their practises as well.

38
00:02:14,511 --> 00:02:16,640
That's how widespread they are.

39
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,070
And we can't solve the problem just by educating providers.

40
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:23,749
We have to change the way we deliver care and support care for

41
00:02:23,749 --> 00:02:27,240
some of these disadvantaged patients.

42
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,840
One example of that.

43
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:33,467
One way the solution's gonna come are through local and regional accurately

44
00:02:33,467 --> 00:02:38,350
actually measure and identify and address disparity and this was one example.

45
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:42,356
It started nearly a decade ago in the Chicago area where researchers

46
00:02:42,356 --> 00:02:46,940
within the healthcare system and the health system in Chicago.

47
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:52,023
I started to notice that beginning in 1996, the mortality from breast cancer

48
00:02:52,023 --> 00:02:56,811
amongst African American white women, which was about the same in 1996 was

49
00:02:56,811 --> 00:03:01,822
starting to separate as more effective screening with mammography, treatment

50
00:03:01,822 --> 00:03:07,076
of surgery, chemotherapy and hormonal therapies was becoming widely available.

51
00:03:07,076 --> 00:03:11,019
And what they saw over just a seven year period was that mortality within

52
00:03:11,019 --> 00:03:15,107
the system in Chicago from breast cancer went down by about a third right.

53
00:03:15,107 --> 00:03:19,060
And at the same time it's improving but it got worse by about 10% for

54
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,537
African American women.

55
00:03:20,537 --> 00:03:25,299
And so at the citywide task force came together that included community leaders

56
00:03:25,299 --> 00:03:29,493
close from the public health and health care delivery system as well as

57
00:03:29,493 --> 00:03:34,040
from the political system to say what's driving this difference.

58
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,350
They focused on three major factors.

59
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:39,240
Access to mammograms, quality of mammograms and

60
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,840
then access to effective treatment.

61
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,807
And that was based on data that they collected within the Chicago community.

62
00:03:45,807 --> 00:03:50,042
And then got to work on addressing those mediators of

63
00:03:50,042 --> 00:03:53,808
the disparities of breast cancer mortality.

64
00:03:53,808 --> 00:03:57,259
And as you're starting to see some narrowing of the gap but

65
00:03:57,259 --> 00:04:01,557
they actually found for example that African American women tend to live

66
00:04:01,557 --> 00:04:06,066
in neighbourhoods that didn't have mammography available or the quality of

67
00:04:06,066 --> 00:04:10,364
the mammograph being done in those neighbourhoods were much lower so they

68
00:04:10,364 --> 00:04:15,171
were less likely to be detected in the early stage of cancer so they can't cured.

69
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:19,546
We recently looked more nationally at use of mammography in the Medicare programme.

70
00:04:19,546 --> 00:04:24,235
And this is a somewhat busy slide and I'll try to break it down for you.

71
00:04:24,235 --> 00:04:28,697
On the right inside the slide is traditional fee for

72
00:04:28,697 --> 00:04:34,406
service Medicare or the type that's about 70% of Medicare and

73
00:04:34,406 --> 00:04:41,277
where basically have coverage in just the government pays for service basis.

74
00:04:41,277 --> 00:04:43,718
In that system which is not very well coordinated,

75
00:04:43,718 --> 00:04:47,293
what we see when we look at mammography rates for women in the late sixties,

76
00:04:47,293 --> 00:04:50,340
we have some of the highest rates of breast cancer.

77
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,240
Okay.

78
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,862
White women shown in the grey bars compared to African Americans in

79
00:04:55,862 --> 00:05:00,161
yellow to that of Hispanics in blue and Asian Pacific in pink.

80
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,842
Across the board on the right hand side of the slide,

81
00:05:03,842 --> 00:05:07,334
white women are statistically more likely to depend on mammography in

82
00:05:07,334 --> 00:05:10,140
this age range where it's important to have.

83
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:14,572
And then if we look at Medicare HMOs where the managed care options,

84
00:05:14,572 --> 00:05:18,228
then 30% enrolment issues that they take a much more

85
00:05:18,228 --> 00:05:22,840
coordinated approach to screening services and mammography.

86
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,503
And they're what we actually see it as much higher levels of quality for

87
00:05:26,503 --> 00:05:28,840
both white and minority women.

88
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:32,463
In fact, those five to 8% lower rates of mammography in

89
00:05:32,463 --> 00:05:35,859
the civil service system are actually eliminated and

90
00:05:35,859 --> 00:05:40,614
reversed to some extent where minority women are slightly more likely than

91
00:05:40,614 --> 00:05:44,561
white women in the HMO programme Medicare to have mammography.

92
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:52,496
And the rates are much higher on the order of about 80% for

93
00:05:52,496 --> 00:06:01,162
all the enrollees on managed care side relative to about 60% people service side.

94
00:06:01,162 --> 00:06:08,051
>> [INAUDIBLE]

95
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,520
>> Yeah. And so many of these HMOs for example,

96
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:21,310
Kaiser is one of the major took providers and Medicare HMOs benefits.

97
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:23,720
And I'll show you some data later.

98
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:28,496
Even more reasonable around treatment of diabetes and

99
00:06:28,496 --> 00:06:35,246
high blood pressure than those integrated systems when they're successful

100
00:06:35,246 --> 00:06:40,980
in raising quality also appear to be more successful [INAUDIBLE].

101
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:46,390
So another way we can improve coordination of care is to use efficient navigators.

102
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:50,349
And they can be either health professionals like nurses workers where

103
00:06:50,349 --> 00:06:52,571
they can be community health workers.

104
00:06:52,571 --> 00:06:57,733
And increasingly we were thinking about using trained folks trained from community

105
00:06:57,733 --> 00:07:02,239
who might have a high school degree or an associates degree from community

106
00:07:02,239 --> 00:07:06,892
college health professionals per se and training them to work with people in

107
00:07:06,892 --> 00:07:12,240
their own neighbourhoods and communities navigate this complex system of care.

108
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,723
And so in many ways it's intuitively appealing.

109
00:07:14,723 --> 00:07:18,195
When we go back to thinking about social determinants of health and

110
00:07:18,195 --> 00:07:19,313
community factors.

111
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:22,891
This is a way we can engage people from the community in addressing some of

112
00:07:22,891 --> 00:07:24,417
the health care disparities,

113
00:07:24,417 --> 00:07:29,340
especially in disadvantaged communities where people are living in poverty.

114
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:33,626
Large immigrant populations that may not have a sort of good understanding

115
00:07:33,626 --> 00:07:36,540
the health care system is structured here.

116
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:39,744
But what's important is we need rigorous evaluation to try and build support for

117
00:07:39,744 --> 00:07:40,940
these programmes.

118
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:44,586
I wanted to show some positive results from cancer screening in

119
00:07:44,586 --> 00:07:48,240
Cambridge Massachusetts as well as New York City.

120
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:53,661
This is a spend ideas with colleagues at Cambridge Health Alliance In Massachusetts

121
00:07:53,661 --> 00:07:57,858
where we took patients who were over the age of 50 and overdue for

122
00:07:57,858 --> 00:08:00,540
colon cancer screening.

123
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:04,627
And this is something where the average rates of screening now in

124
00:08:04,627 --> 00:08:07,840
Massachusetts are around 60 to 70%.

125
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:13,519
But there's still, were 40% of people who are eligible for

126
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:19,240
the screening or in Canada work likely to be in my life.

127
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:23,663
So we went into a series of community health centres in the Cambridge area

128
00:08:23,663 --> 00:08:27,075
of Massachusetts that preserving large proportions,

129
00:08:27,075 --> 00:08:32,009
particularly patient immigrants from Haiti as well as immigrants from brazil,

130
00:08:32,009 --> 00:08:33,550
many English speaking.

131
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:38,599
And we recruited patient navigators from those communities who are bilingual and

132
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:41,900
bicultural to work with the patient.

133
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:46,572
And what we found over about a year with this individualised coaching and

134
00:08:46,572 --> 00:08:51,937
navigation, that our screen rates in the overall population increased from about

135
00:08:51,937 --> 00:08:57,940
21% and this was of that 30-40% that night had been screened to about 34%.

136
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:00,110
But in fact that the improvement and

137
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:03,728
screaming is the largest amongst patients where at the bottom

138
00:09:03,728 --> 00:09:09,440
of the slide shows an increase from about 19% nearly doubled up to 40%.

139
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,361
And that was highly significant.

140
00:09:11,361 --> 00:09:16,208
And we saw less of it prominent effect on the English speaking patients amongst this

141
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:17,072
population.

142
00:09:17,072 --> 00:09:21,178
So showing some of the interactions of race and ethnicity with language and

143
00:09:21,178 --> 00:09:24,370
income and how certain efforts like patient navigators to

144
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:27,451
improve coordination and improve access and outcome.

145
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:34,160
And then the example from New York, what's interesting patient navigators.

146
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,100
But they actually had a large public education campaign.

147
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:43,680
This was an example of the targeted to middle aged African American

148
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:49,340
patients first screen and Simpson promoting this.

149
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:52,925
And it was combined with the use of community health workers and

150
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:56,579
navigators to help people understand the screening options and

151
00:09:56,579 --> 00:10:01,244
follow up with the appropriate tests as well as disease registries where they used

152
00:10:01,244 --> 00:10:05,661
more advanced health information systems to track who is do over screening.

153
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:10,840
And this is basically what they found over a relatively short period.

154
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:15,829
You go back to 2003 the racial screening with premium mediocre in all

155
00:10:15,829 --> 00:10:19,858
three of the ethnic groups are cities that are shown here.

156
00:10:19,858 --> 00:10:22,374
Whites just under 50% and black and

157
00:10:22,374 --> 00:10:28,440
Hispanic adults who were eligible are age 50 a little over a third being screened.

158
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,215
And with this comprehensive effort to promote screening,

159
00:10:31,215 --> 00:10:33,941
the rates of screening were raised from all three groups.

160
00:10:33,941 --> 00:10:38,821
And by 2007 the disparity was essentially eliminated where nearly 2/3 of

161
00:10:38,821 --> 00:10:43,440
each of those three groups had been screened appropriately.

162
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,025
And there was an article in the New York Times, quoted then director of

163
00:10:48,025 --> 00:10:53,481
New York City Health Department, the CBC Dr Thomas Frieden, who said his career.

164
00:10:53,481 --> 00:10:57,038
Three things that surprised him how quickly they got tuberculosis centre

165
00:10:57,038 --> 00:10:58,040
control.

166
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,360
They brought them tobacco use in the city.

167
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,561
But most surprising was how quickly they eliminate

168
00:11:04,561 --> 00:11:09,551
disparities close the race and ethnicity gap in screaming.

169
00:11:09,551 --> 00:11:12,479
So showing that this is a tough problem to solve, but

170
00:11:12,479 --> 00:11:16,551
it's not insurmountable if we're developing better system to improve
