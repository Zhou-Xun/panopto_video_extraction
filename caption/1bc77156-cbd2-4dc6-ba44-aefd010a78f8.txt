1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:18,310
I really appreciate you shouldn't be able to talk to me about my condition.

2
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:24,990
That I'd like to be able to talk about money.

3
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:32,810
I went to court today. I wanted to talk about how I could be released free.

4
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:39,370
So hopefully I'll give you my retirement. Nice work.

5
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:47,670
And I also released this. I met instructions for your semester long project up here.

6
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:52,640
I hope you had a chance to review the instructions.

7
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:59,280
As you can see, there are various draft components of this project due throughout the semester,

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,710
which you'll complete as a group and just turn in one and we'll get you feedback and very,

9
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:18,200
very specific instructions around each section and what's expected of you as you've had a chance to go through that.

10
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:24,480
This might be a page document of instructions that are there any questions that come to mind that I can clarify?

11
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:46,990
Yes. But the contract we're having once a signature or everybody has to submit their own.

12
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:53,499
We're working on it together until we submit one each and you work on it together and to submit

13
00:01:53,500 --> 00:02:00,490
one as a group and then designate someone to submit group assignments on behalf of the group.

14
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:10,750
Okay. So one of my goals is to teach you to be concise.

15
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:18,760
So a lot of these components, you don't have a lot of room to go on and on.

16
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:27,210
That might actually make it a little easier for you to just keep it contained in terms of the type of information you're communicating.

17
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:35,020
So each of these sections is, you know, you're not really turning in a whole lot of stuff to not pages and pages.

18
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:45,580
It'll turn into that at the end. But there is quite a bit of thought and work that goes into each section that you'll work on.

19
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:50,940
I see. I can better. Yeah. Can I find this on canvas or was it just email?

20
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:58,540
Um, so it's on canvas on the home page. All the group project stuff is at the very bottom.

21
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:02,110
So you scroll down and you see the links there.

22
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:08,440
Yes. Yeah. So the assignment instructions are there, the groups are there.

23
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:13,900
And then the tips for working effectively in groups are also there.

24
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:26,950
So is this pretty straightforward, the instructions here, what's expected of you?

25
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:33,900
If at any point as you're working on I'm so I feel free to reach out.

26
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:41,890
We're happy to clarify. And again, a lot of what you're working on this semester is turning in their tracks.

27
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:53,379
So perfection is not expected. We want you to be integrating feedback along the way and happy to meet with groups to talk to you about.

28
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:59,020
Various sections are in front of your questions, especially around, you know,

29
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:08,290
your conceptual model as you start to draft a report that drafts and give you feedback and meet with you whatever,

30
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:21,150
looking comfortable to you as you sort of evolve your. And I also wanted to talk to you about your theory assessment.

31
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:28,350
Number one, that's due on Friday. So we opened up after class today.

32
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,800
Then you'll have until Friday midnight to complete it.

33
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:40,050
And I'm not sure we'll get through all of the content that I wanted to cover today, which includes the theory of reasoned action.

34
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:47,820
And if we run out of time, I'll definitely be covering the new model, but we can move that in one day.

35
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,980
If that happens, your theory assessment will be based on novelty.

36
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:57,180
Yes. So you should have all the information you need to complete that.

37
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:03,330
Do we have any questions about what's expected of you to do that assignment?

38
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:12,350
Any advice I can give you? Yeah.

39
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:17,010
What was the citation format that you want us to use?

40
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:22,260
Um, you can just use a may. There are no citations expected in this.

41
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:31,320
This is really just it's a low stakes assignment, and we're not grading around your writing style or citations or any of that.

42
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:36,450
I'm really focused on whether you understand the concepts and apply them.

43
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,820
I'm asking for like an eight 100 word limit, so keep it concise.

44
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:51,430
If you just want to respond and does well thorough, let's make sure you're thorough and responding and that's totally fine as well.

45
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:55,950
We're really just looking for understanding of the concepts.

46
00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:05,290
So keeping that in mind, that's why I'm the first day I said, Don't spend too much time on it.

47
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:10,680
It's open. Know your notes and work with the client if you want to.

48
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:18,270
Um. Again, perfection is not expected just to see that you're understanding the concept.

49
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:29,310
If you are spending feel like you're spending a lot of time on it, feel free to talk to us.

50
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:33,550
We can give you some tips on how to keep this contained.

51
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:40,420
It's really again, most states just want to make sure we have opportunities to apply the concepts.

52
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:53,380
Your world class might be devoted to the group projects outside of the class time be devoted to a group project.

53
00:06:53,500 --> 00:07:00,670
Yeah. So we had several class sessions where I'd like for you guys to work with your group.

54
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:10,510
So, um, on the syllabus you'll see some weeks where it has like a theory that we're going to cover and then some, I call it group time.

55
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:19,180
So we'll devote one of those days to group time and all that, you know, in advance so you guys can prepare with your group.

56
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:24,190
And most of the times you'll be here as well.

57
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:30,460
I want to make sure we're supporting you and there's no expectation to meet here when you have group time.

58
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:35,229
We do want to, you know, utilize that time and we have obviously have this space.

59
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:39,280
So this is a fine place to meet and work on your projects.

60
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:45,490
Um, but you can also work virtually or somewhere else during that time as well.

61
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:55,510
These are questions. Okay.

62
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:59,090
So if it comes out, just reach out to us. Happy to support you.

63
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:05,910
So you have two things to do this Friday. One related to your project and one related serious stuff.

64
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:12,300
So I want to start off by diving into the health relief model.

65
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:23,280
Um, it's one of the most widely used models in our discipline and talked about how I'm not sure it's used that much anymore,

66
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:28,240
but it used to be and people talk about it a lot.

67
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:32,820
So I want to make sure, you know the ins and outs of this model as well.

68
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:43,230
So today I'm going to just walk through the health leaf model and also talk about some complications of the various constructs.

69
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:50,230
So then I hope the leave model is a conceptual model and it's not a theory.

70
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,320
Other theories were actually used to inform this model and its context.

71
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:06,010
So Help Believe model is based on value expectancy theories that were developed by cognitive experience psychology.

72
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:17,290
And so now your expectancy theory is essentially telling us that behavior is viewed as a function of the subjective

73
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:25,690
value of an outcome to an individual and of the subjective expectation that an action will achieve that outcome.

74
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:30,160
So that's a little complicated. What does that mean? So I'm going to state that very simply.

75
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:45,309
What that means is if you value an outcome and there's expectation that whatever we do will achieve that outcome, something will happen.

76
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:49,450
So if we care about it and we expect something to happen, we are more likely to do it.

77
00:09:50,290 --> 00:10:00,460
So if we care about it and then we also expect something to happen, we are more likely to take action engaged in that behavior.

78
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:03,770
So that's what a value expectancy theory is telling.

79
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:13,300
This behavior is viewed as a function of our subjective value of an outcome and the subjective expectation that an action will achieve that outcome.

80
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:19,720
So that was developed by cognitive theorists.

81
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,980
Cognitive psychology is focused on how we think.

82
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,730
That's what cognitive psychology is all about.

83
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:33,729
That's what that discipline is all about. Someone, in theory, is coming from cognitive psychology.

84
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:37,120
It's all about how we think and process information.

85
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:43,480
So the whole belief model is really centered around understanding.

86
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:47,350
That's the core of that model. It's about understanding.

87
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:58,870
And it was first developed to understand preventative health actions that were one time in nature, such as screening or getting a shot.

88
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:09,310
So those are typically actions that people I mean, they may do it repeatedly over time, but typically viewed as sort of one time in nature.

89
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:18,520
And it was this model was first developed right here at U of M by the U.S. Public Health Service during the 1950s.

90
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:23,590
And psychologists were in the know we're in the public health service.

91
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:32,470
We're asked to understand and explain why people were not engaged, people were not going in to get screened for tuberculosis.

92
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:39,400
So and so TB is not as common here as it used to be.

93
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:45,640
But at that time, people were wondering why people were not going in to get screened for TB.

94
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:52,929
So this model has been shown to successfully predict changes in a variety of different health behaviors,

95
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:57,969
like getting flu shots or your seatbelts up and taking medications.

96
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:03,850
And these are the types of behaviors where this sort of model has shown a lot of promise.

97
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:10,150
It really hasn't been shown to explain smoking and alcohol intake behaviors as well.

98
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:16,600
It's mostly been used for preventative and then later on health maintenance.

99
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,800
So really focus on factors that we are actually doing something about.

100
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:32,979
So in a few weeks, we'll talk more about theories and models that are better suited for understanding alcohol and smoking behavior.

101
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:37,330
But hopefully the model isn't as good as predicting.

102
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:42,370
So you said it was created in the 1950s here at Michigan, University of Michigan,

103
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:50,140
and then tuberculosis and windows and with the apartment by the US Public Health Service.

104
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:55,240
So really trying to understand why people were not going to get screened for.

105
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,050
So these are the key constructs in the whole wave model.

106
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:14,360
The model is grouped into modifying factors, individual beliefs and then constructs related to actions.

107
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:20,900
So modifying factors are things that we can were able to.

108
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:27,300
Things that would change our individual beliefs.

109
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:35,459
So things like our age or gender or ethnicity or personality, these are mostly like demographic factors.

110
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:45,010
And then you have knowledge and they're modifying factors and yet just generally a market of factors that typically would change or individual.

111
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:54,330
And then the core of the model are the constructs that make up individual beliefs and what results from that.

112
00:13:55,290 --> 00:14:01,140
So you see here perception a lot of perceived.

113
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:10,620
What does that mean? So perception typically means from the view of the individual, it may not be what's actually happening in reality.

114
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:18,840
So it's people, like I said, value expectancy, theories, subjective views, perceptions.

115
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:22,590
So it's really from the view of the individual, it doesn't necessarily mean.

116
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:24,960
It may or may not match reality.

117
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:33,210
So we have perceived susceptibility and severity of disease, which are two distinct concepts that can be a little confusing.

118
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:38,160
These are talking about two different things. They're not interchangeable.

119
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:45,660
So perceived susceptibility refers to beliefs about the likelihood of getting a disease or condition.

120
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:54,730
For example, how likely does a student think that they're going to catch the flu this season?

121
00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:00,450
That's perceived susceptibility. How likely do they think they're going to catch the flu this season?

122
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:10,490
And then perceived severity refers to the seriousness of contracting an illness or the status quo and not engaging in certain behavior.

123
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:17,130
So how bad will the flu be if I get that's perceived severity, how bad will it be for me?

124
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:27,870
And so, for example, if a student ask themselves, how disabling will it be if I get the flu?

125
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:34,740
Do they think it's going to be for a few days? Is it going to disrupt two weeks of classes and make you bedridden?

126
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:38,370
Those are the range of possibilities with perceived severity.

127
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:47,040
And it's really the combination of perceived susceptibility and perceived severity that is called perceived threat of the disease.

128
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:55,139
So it's the combination of those two that informs our threat of a particular disease or illness and then

129
00:15:55,140 --> 00:16:02,610
perceived barriers or negative aspects of an action that impedes us from undertaking a recommended behavior.

130
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:13,620
So we might want a particular student to get a flu shot, but they don't see how they can get one because they may not have health insurance.

131
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:16,439
So from their perspective,

132
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:23,130
not having health insurance is their perceived barrier or they think they cannot get a flu shot because they do not want insurance.

133
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:30,150
But there are also potential positive outcomes and what we typically refer to as the perceived benefits of this model.

134
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:38,399
So if the student learned that the cost of a flu shot is actually far less than going to

135
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:46,680
the doctor or emergency department or investing in medicines if they do fall sick or that,

136
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:53,640
you know, a pharmacy or a certain group is actually subsidizing the costs of the flu shot,

137
00:16:55,110 --> 00:17:04,290
then maybe the student perceives this situation as that their out-of-pocket costs will be far less than if they actually fall sick.

138
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:13,740
So there are some benefits to getting the flu shot, because when I get sick, it can be more expensive than if I don't ever get sick.

139
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:24,360
So it's used and used to be that perceived benefits and barriers are thought of as some sort of decisional balance, and they work together.

140
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:32,060
And in some cases it might. But studies have shown that they actually operate independently to influence action.

141
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:37,649
So your perceived benefits or even your perceived barriers,

142
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:42,840
either one of the two could have profound impacts on your likelihood of engaging in behavior.

143
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:47,610
So it's not necessarily that they are each other or work together.

144
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,680
They used to be thought of that way, but they can also be working in the committee.

145
00:17:52,800 --> 00:18:03,060
Let me go to to action, which is an element of the model that's not really systematically studied or empirically studied,

146
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:11,639
because it's a little hard to sort of show causality in terms of that is the thing

147
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:16,380
that influenced that behavior in terms of thinking about our methods to do that.

148
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:19,110
But it's something we see all the time.

149
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:28,829
Q Action is something that happens in the environment that leads us to think about engaging in a behavior like a celebrity,

150
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:33,840
endorsing a preventative health practice so that everybody engages with us.

151
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:41,610
So it's just something in our physical or social environment that might prompt people to all of a sudden take action.

152
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:50,490
And then there's self-efficacy, which is the confidence that one feels in carrying out a particular task.

153
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:57,660
Hopefully, if model is not the primary theoretical hope, self-efficacy.

154
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:03,330
Self-efficacy was born out of social cognitive theory, which we'll talk about in a few weeks.

155
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:11,910
But self-efficacy was included in earlier versions of the health belief model, but has been added in more recent versions,

156
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:17,489
really due to the increasing recognition of its role in maintaining behavioral change.

157
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:26,730
So it sort of recognizes this construct in our field that really has profound impacts on behavior and behavior change.

158
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:35,250
So in later iterations they started including self-efficacy and the model which came out of social cognitive theory we talked about.

159
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:44,100
So it's a combination of all of these factors together that really predict the likelihood that individual will change their behavior.

160
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:51,620
Questions about the constructs and how they interact.

161
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:03,329
So this is a summary of action which provides us with a good clue of whether a

162
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:08,040
person will actually change their behavior if they believe they're susceptible.

163
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:14,910
They believe the condition is serious and they believe something can be done to reduce the threat.

164
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:20,190
There are some benefits to taking action, and the benefits outweigh the barriers.

165
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:27,540
These are the facts the likelihood of someone taking action under the Constitution or changing their views.

166
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:39,049
So in terms of evidence from a research and practice standpoint,

167
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:48,160
we want to know whether they could be helpful constructs or associated with behaviors and whether interventions that have been developed

168
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:55,880
and targeted and hopefully model constructs in their programmatic activities are actually effective in changing old behaviors.

169
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:05,660
So the answer is yes to both of these questions based on a review of evidence over the last 50 years, although there's still more work to be done.

170
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:16,370
So so there is evidence behind the constructs in the hopefully model to change behavior.

171
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:21,650
And people have been doing empirical work on this for over 50 years now to show that.

172
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:27,319
So in terms of evidence of individual constraints,

173
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:35,990
perceived barriers is really the strongest people have found that it's the strongest predictor of behavior change in this model,

174
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:47,600
and then perceived benefits and susceptibility and perceived severity actually has the weakest evidence in terms of changing behavior.

175
00:21:48,050 --> 00:22:01,430
And there's just a lack of empirical data really demonstrating in the context of how a belief model, the role of self-efficacy in cues to touch.

176
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:15,440
So this table provides intervention strategies for addressing each of these constructs when developing an intervention.

177
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:24,530
And these are things you can actually do. So you are using the Help Believe model to actually address a problem in a particular population.

178
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:31,640
You can first survey people where the extent to which any of these factors are keeping them from engaging in a particular

179
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:39,440
health behavior and perhaps one or a few of these chronic concerns is most pronounced in your target population of interest.

180
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:45,320
You then use strategies that align with those constructs as part of your intervention strategy.

181
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:57,020
So these are some. This table just highlights the types of things you might do.

182
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:06,250
So as you guys are working on your projects, you might refer back to this table to think about your conceptual model.

183
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:14,860
For example, Tuesday action is something that is really relevant to the problem you're looking at.

184
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:21,920
These are some ways that you might build some strategies into your overall intervention plan to address.

185
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:27,999
To really address that construct very specifically. So with cues to action,

186
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:40,320
we want to really promote awareness and use of appropriate reminder and recall systems to prompt change for perceived severity.

187
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:46,840
For example, you really want to show people the consequences or the risks of a condition.

188
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:52,720
We try to trigger emotions like distrust and regret.

189
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:57,999
That sounds, as I say, a little like, why would you do that to someone?

190
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:04,610
But with the perceived severity, you're really trying to highlight how how bad will it be if I get this condition?

191
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:16,270
So I really want to show people, you know, this is the range of things that could really happen and really get some reaction on that.

192
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:30,069
So like I mentioned on the first day of class,

193
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:38,800
there's no theory or conceptual model that comes back to in terms of explaining the variation we see in health outcomes.

194
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:48,580
And this model is fairly good at predicting certain types of health behaviors, but it's not really good at explaining how behavior change occurs.

195
00:24:52,660 --> 00:25:06,760
So what do I mean by that? So in this model, it's very boxes and arrows and it's really telling you what predicts the likelihood of behavior change.

196
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:11,589
It's your individual beliefs and then competition combined with your modifying factors

197
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:15,910
and cues that action that might influence your likelihood of behavior change.

198
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:29,380
It's very associational. It's very predictive of it, but it's not really explaining how a behavior change process might occur in May.

199
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:37,759
It's really telling us the things that. Would influence that behavior change if are actually trying to change behavior.

200
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:42,220
It doesn't really give us any sort of process overall.

201
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:51,370
In other words, a set of conditions really based on perceived threat benefits and barriers will tell us likelihood of inaction,

202
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:54,820
but it doesn't tell us exactly how action happens.

203
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:58,470
And this is one of the limitations of the whole model.

204
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:04,149
There are other theories and models that actually we will go through that.

205
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:08,290
Tell us how you explain behavior change, how that behavior changes.

206
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:15,250
And this doesn't tell us that the whole belief model is very much a cognitive based model.

207
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:25,030
I remember it was formulated based on value expectancy theories which were formulated by cognitive psychologists and cognitive psychologists.

208
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:33,100
Study how we think. One of the criticisms of this model is that it doesn't consider the emotional components of behavior.

209
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:39,629
So one example is fear in public health.

210
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:46,980
We've seen time and time again that interventions that try to scare people into engaging in risky behaviors.

211
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:53,940
One example that is showing images of black lives in order to get people to stop smoking.

212
00:26:55,470 --> 00:27:02,250
Another example is sexual education that's really trying to convey messages that sex is bad.

213
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:14,700
So despite these messages, we still know that people smoke across the spectrum when people are sexually active.

214
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:19,110
So we have to question whether these strategies actually work.

215
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:27,690
So some researchers have added fear as an explanatory construct when the other constructs in the health belief model,

216
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:32,040
which is shown to produce, has shown to predict behavior.

217
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:37,440
So when fear is actually coupled with enhancing cognitive dimensions of the model.

218
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:46,380
It appears to work more effectively. So with the belief model, you can add in a little fear.

219
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:48,870
But again, this is a cognitively based model.

220
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:58,290
So if you're using strategies that sort of enhance people's perception of their susceptibility or severity.

221
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:06,510
So those are cognitive dimensions alongside fear. Researchers have shown that it actually works a little more effectively.

222
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:12,540
So fear arousal is not a strategy that's totally off the table.

223
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:17,490
I know it's used a lot in our field, unfortunately.

224
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:26,870
I mean, it's not always bad. It works when the threat is significant and we give people some skills or information that helps them with that way.

225
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:34,760
So there are conditions under which it is potentially useful to use an across the literature.

226
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:43,700
The evidence has shown that fear tactics, coupled with a message on some skills or information on how to remove the threat or most effective,

227
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:54,780
and typically one time only versus repeated behaviors such as detection, behaviors like screening or preventative behaviors like getting a vaccine.

228
00:28:54,870 --> 00:29:03,540
So I. This idea of fear tactics with some skills on removing the threat are most effective with one type.

229
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:09,520
So to summarize, it's ineffective to scare people.

230
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:12,580
And as a public health intervention strategy,

231
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:20,770
we know the consequences of engaging in certain health behaviors will result in some pretty serious consequences for people's health,

232
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:31,350
such as death, in some cases, death or other scary messages or something is what you choose to highlight in your event.

233
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:32,200
Intervention.

234
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:39,640
The most effective way to create some behavior change is to really give some people information or skills training alongside with others.

235
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:49,059
So this are key takeaways from the health believe model.

236
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:57,130
The model is specific to health related behaviors. It's not a theory because we don't apply the model to all aspects of human behavior.

237
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:05,019
In, for example, we wouldn't apply the healthily model to academic learning or understanding

238
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:09,280
romantic relationships or some other social phenomenon that's outside of life.

239
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,740
So that's why it's not a theory. The core of this model is understanding risk.

240
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:25,600
This is a risk based model and very much how an individual views the situation that they are, and hence the emphasis on perceptions.

241
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:32,680
And sometimes the barriers that we feel to take a health related action has nothing to do with health,

242
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:36,310
and our intervention need to acknowledge and recognize that.

243
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:52,020
Any questions? Well, we walk through an example. Could you elaborate on the last point that you just made that sometimes tried say, what did you say?

244
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:53,850
They might have nothing to do with health,

245
00:30:53,860 --> 00:31:01,740
but so sometimes the barriers that we feel to taking some sort of health related action have nothing to do with our health.

246
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:10,830
And our interventions need to acknowledge and recognize that it's like a financial barrier or something.

247
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:21,330
Yeah, right. Financial barriers, you know, although it could be directly related to the cost of taking action,

248
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:30,690
that's sort of a bigger sort of element of a person's life that might detract them from taking a health related action.

249
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:35,950
Would like access to like like the news, like paper or television.

250
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:47,790
Yeah. Like relation to it. Like if you don't, if you're not able to have access to what is going on currently or what could be going on,

251
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:55,710
you might not have you might not be aware of how bad things could be or how fast things are going to be something.

252
00:31:56,610 --> 00:32:08,829
Yeah, I think that might fall through my couch that under socioeconomic status, I'm a little more for that.

253
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:13,620
But I could also see an argument of that being touched, a nerve with these barriers.

254
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:22,380
If you ask the individual and that's what they said, like I don't have access to any of this stuff to be able to engage in that.

255
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:31,920
So that's sort of taking two things into account, their more objective situation, which would be socioeconomic status,

256
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:41,670
if that is in fact their situation and then their perception of that situation, which may align with reality in that case.

257
00:32:41,670 --> 00:33:05,720
And that is that. So let's walk through an example how how the model has been used in researching this.

258
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:16,800
So Dr. Nancy Jantz is a retired faculty member from The Age, which is a outfit,

259
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:25,290
and she devoted quite a bit of her career to thinking about the health relief model,

260
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:33,360
its theoretical development and its application to understanding behaviors in the cancer setting.

261
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:40,170
So she conducted a study on understanding attitudes and practices of colorectal cancer screening.

262
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:46,319
And so the goals of her study was to find out attitudes of colorectal cancer screening

263
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:50,280
and what people were doing and whether this was different by gender and race.

264
00:33:52,310 --> 00:34:02,660
So she used constructs from the health belief model and developed questions to find out how susceptible people thought they were to colorectal cancer,

265
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:08,660
how severe they think it actually is, and what benefits and barriers they perceived in getting screening.

266
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:17,780
They also assessed choose to action. So the question they asked to measure cues to action was whether they got a physician recommendation.

267
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:24,740
So for people who actually got screened, they asked them, Did you actually get a physician recommendation?

268
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:27,440
Is that the thing that prompted you to get screened?

269
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:36,420
So Dr. Dance also included a bunch of other questions on our survey tool outside of the home plate model,

270
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:42,240
and they asked all these questions in the context of three screening tests for colorectal cancer,

271
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:49,800
and they gave this survey to middle aged and older adult men and women between the ages of 50 and 79,

272
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:55,140
both African-American and white, who had no prior history of colorectal cancer.

273
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:05,770
And what they found in their study was they're getting a physician recommendation which represented,

274
00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:10,000
again, cue to action was a really powerful motivator to getting screened.

275
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,650
We also found quite a few barriers people were reporting.

276
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:20,650
So across all those three tests they found there was this perception of no need.

277
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:26,320
I don't I don't need this test. And people felt embarrassed.

278
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:29,740
They told to make I.D. around the procedure.

279
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:34,810
And these were typically common problems that were noted.

280
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:43,570
And for serving screening tests, pain and cost were also additional barriers perceived by individuals.

281
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:53,260
They also. We found that African-American females were the least likely to get screened.

282
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:56,830
So when they asked, when they looked at their data by demographic factors,

283
00:35:57,730 --> 00:36:03,620
they found a certain population that was least likely to get screened among everyone survey.

284
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:10,180
So what do you do with this information? You find out what might be people's options.

285
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:14,290
You find out a whole host of barriers that people are facing and getting screened.

286
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:17,920
So what do you do about this? So.

287
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:29,540
So you in general, you want to really identify some of the factors that indirectly or directly connect

288
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:34,450
to the likelihood of people changing their colorectal cancer screening behaviors.

289
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:36,590
I look back at that hopefully model.

290
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:46,600
You saw that cuz that action was directly pointed to likelihood of changing behavior and we also saw perceived benefit barriers as well.

291
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:50,000
These were things we found out in our survey.

292
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:56,450
So you might educate physicians to recommend these screening tests more since we gathered from

293
00:36:56,450 --> 00:37:01,000
the survey that people are more likely to get screened if their physician tells them to.

294
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:16,190
So that's one possibility. And another is really thinking about how to address all those barriers.

295
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:20,190
So people said cost was a barrier. You might offset the costs.

296
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:24,270
People have said fears about these certain types of tests.

297
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:34,200
So you might think about different ways of different sort of counseling techniques or outrage that might alleviate some of those fears.

298
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:36,300
And throughout the semester,

299
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:51,569
we'll sort of talk about different ways to have really different ways of outreach in trying to mitigate people's fears and barriers that have

300
00:37:51,570 --> 00:38:01,560
some evidence behind them and sort of draw from other sort of theories and different sort of social science concepts that we'll be discussing.

301
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:09,420
So so that's one example of just how someone actually applied that,

302
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:16,680
hopefully from constructs to working with a specific population and understanding barriers.

303
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:22,679
And through your theory assessment this week you'll see you'll read a similar

304
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:27,870
study with an intervention that's informed by helpful informal constructs.

305
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:35,270
And we want you to sort of pick out what what sort of these intervention activities, what are they addressing when it comes to people.

306
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:44,990
So you'll see sort of this intervention come to life. Okay.

307
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:56,800
So we have about 10 minutes. And so I'm going to start into the theory of reason, the action, but we may have to go into next week.

308
00:38:56,970 --> 00:39:01,040
Then I'll do a little bit of a recap next week with the first one.

309
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:08,870
So another set of individual level theories, our theory of reasoning, the action plan behavior and integrated behavior,

310
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:16,129
and all of these build off of each other in terms of intentions or certain of constructs.

311
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:23,720
So they're sort of related but different. The theory of reasoned action is also rooted in value expressed can see vary.

312
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:28,850
So again, these come from cognitive psychology.

313
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:32,720
So again, we're concerned with cognitive transitions here.

314
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:42,350
The theory of reasoned action is a theory because it's applied to many different kinds of human behavior and not just related to health.

315
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:50,210
So theory of recent action and health belief model have the same sort of core origin, but they're actually different.

316
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:55,489
The Theory of Reason, Action Plan Behavior, an integrated behavioral model.

317
00:39:55,490 --> 00:40:05,470
So this whole sort of group of theories and models focus on attitudes related to performing the behavior of interest.

318
00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:13,700
Whereas in the health belief model, attitudes are focused more on the specific illness or health condition.

319
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:23,420
So for example, in the health, the lead model is the behavior change of interest was getting by demography screening.

320
00:40:23,810 --> 00:40:31,549
The attitudes in the model would be related to perceived susceptibility and severity,

321
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:39,620
which are focused on the issue of breast cancer and also behavioral eventually getting screening.

322
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:56,630
So say that again is so in the health belief model for behavior of interest might be getting a bit longer, but if that middle area,

323
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:03,770
when we're talking about perceived threat or perceived susceptibility precedes severity,

324
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:10,770
it's not related to getting screened is related to the issue of breast cancer.

325
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,120
So the illness or disease that you're trying to prevent by getting screened.

326
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:28,489
So in the House, in the theory of reasoned action plan behavior, an integrated behavioral model, we're just focused on the behavior of interest.

327
00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:33,120
We don't really nothing is really related to illness.

328
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:43,790
So an attitude toward behavior based on the theory of reasoned action, according to the architects of this theory,

329
00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:53,410
is a much better predictor of behavior than attitude toward the object or disease, that the behavior is directed, indirect.

330
00:41:53,840 --> 00:42:01,040
So they they sort of have come to the conclusion that you really need to focus on screening the behavior itself and our

331
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:11,840
attitudes towards that behavior and not bring in our attitudes around different types of cancer and the disease itself.

332
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:18,450
Any questions about that process?

333
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:23,030
The first, second and. Does that make sense?

334
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:41,580
So in the theory of reasoned action, every construct in the model is focused on the behavior we're trying to perform.

335
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:50,460
So general attitudes and beliefs toward health or illness are not relevant to the likelihood of engaging in a particular disease.

336
00:42:51,900 --> 00:43:00,000
So instead, the most important factor that determines whether it be one engage in a behavior is behavioral intervention.

337
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:04,469
And the theory of reasoned action asserts that it's a much better predictor than our

338
00:43:04,470 --> 00:43:10,150
attitudes related to the general health or illness or the object that we should be to.

339
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:30,760
So what does this word mean? Volitional control. Yeah.

340
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:36,469
Basically, like your will to do something. Exactly.

341
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:44,300
So. Because the theory of reasoned action is really focused on behavioral intention.

342
00:43:44,810 --> 00:43:54,050
That's like the strongest predictor of engaging in a particular behavior or behavioral intention or intention to perform that behavior.

343
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:59,270
The theory of reasoned action is largely predicated on the notion that you have to learn.

344
00:43:59,330 --> 00:44:03,200
You have a lot of control over the behavior we're trying to perform,

345
00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:09,830
and we process information in a rational way, meaning that the behavior is under volitional control.

346
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:15,880
No. It's more like voluntary volitional kind of contact.

347
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:21,299
Yeah. When you've really thought about it a lot.

348
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:31,670
And you know, again, this is a theory developed by cognitive psychologists, so they're focused on thinking and we've really thought about it.

349
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:39,770
And that is why that is it informed our intent to actually engage in a particular behavior.

350
00:44:39,770 --> 00:44:43,190
So there's a lot of reasoning and thought put into it.

351
00:44:44,450 --> 00:44:53,750
So volitional control means really conscious, deliberate action, the cognitive process, and there's a lot of thinking involved in that.

352
00:44:54,700 --> 00:45:02,140
So some behaviors under volitional control do have the potential to become automatic for us through repetitive actions.

353
00:45:02,710 --> 00:45:06,960
But behaviors that are non volitional are ones that we don't really have control over.

354
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:15,360
So some behaviors that become habitual that we can't exercise control over can become non volitional such as addictive.

355
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:20,730
But we won't be talking about addictive behaviors in the context of this.

356
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:26,200
I'll talk about that. This is another category of behaviors that requires its own discussion.

357
00:45:26,650 --> 00:45:32,260
So we'll talk about that when we talk about some other sort of theories and methods.

358
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:44,830
So what do you think of this idea of volitional control? It's like perceived.

359
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:51,870
Let's say their perceived control like how you singular you have.

360
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:59,120
How much do you think you. So volitional control is a good conscious, deliberate action.

361
00:45:59,130 --> 00:46:02,580
So you really thought about something.

362
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:09,390
But you're right. There's a perception of how much you you have a will,

363
00:46:09,930 --> 00:46:15,960
how much will you exert over that behavior and that situation, which leads how much you have thought about it.

364
00:46:18,390 --> 00:46:25,260
So does this happen all the time? Like every decision you make every day and every behavior you choose to engage in.

365
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:29,430
Have you sat down and really thought about it before you've done it?

366
00:46:37,610 --> 00:46:41,450
So volitional control is interesting. It's.

367
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:49,360
I think. Well, we'll sort of see the limitations of this.

368
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:52,990
I mean, it is one of the biggest criticisms of this model,

369
00:46:53,420 --> 00:47:00,880
that it's predicated on the fact that many of the behaviors have to be under volitional control.

370
00:47:01,810 --> 00:47:09,490
So the theory of reason to action is really insufficient to predict behaviors where volitional control is reduced.

371
00:47:10,390 --> 00:47:14,320
And it tends to assume that people are rational actors.

372
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:21,760
And the data retention approach typically provides a framework for discerning and understanding

373
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:30,070
the reasons or beliefs that motivated behavior of interest for a particular population.

374
00:47:30,610 --> 00:47:34,810
So it's not there are some benefits to it.

375
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:43,750
So it does help us really understand people's motivations, their beliefs, their attitudes around engaging in a particular action,

376
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:48,220
which is really helpful to understand if you're designing an intervention.

377
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:59,139
But, you know, one of the largest criticisms of this model is this idea of, you know, it works best under behaviors that are under volitional control.

378
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:04,510
And I think that's not a lot of behaviors anymore.

379
00:48:05,130 --> 00:48:06,880
We're going to need coordination.

380
00:48:19,510 --> 00:48:30,310
So these are some behaviors where people have tested the theory of reasoned action constructs and where they seem to show some good evidence.

381
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:40,570
So smoking and alcohol use, but not in the addictive sense of addiction, is, again,

382
00:48:41,830 --> 00:48:49,450
different from this context in which there has been evidence generated around the theory of reasoned action.

383
00:48:50,650 --> 00:48:59,560
Health Services use, exercise, sun protection, breastfeeding, HIV tie prevention consent,

384
00:49:00,010 --> 00:49:07,510
contraceptive use, cancer screenings, helmet use and sort of nutritional choices.

385
00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:15,700
Donating blood foods that are pretty controlled settings where you try to generate evidence or

386
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:25,810
look to see if these different constructs are actually predicting real life behaviors in practice.

387
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:40,510
You know, we can all argue you can argue that many of these can be put into a volitional control situation to be able to generate evidence.

388
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:49,600
So this is a visual depiction of the theory of recent action using some sort of like boxes and arrows format.

389
00:49:50,470 --> 00:49:54,310
So just want to work our way from right to left with the theory.

390
00:49:54,310 --> 00:50:00,340
So behavioral intervention is the strongest direct predictor of the behavior of interest,

391
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:11,590
and our behavioral intentions or intention to perform a particular behavior is determined by our attitude towards the behavior and our

392
00:50:11,590 --> 00:50:20,650
perceptions of the social norms regarding the behavior and other factors play into our attitudes and our perceptions of social norms and all.

393
00:50:21,130 --> 00:50:24,190
I work with you guys, unpack that.

394
00:50:24,190 --> 00:50:31,290
So I want to start with attitudes. So attitudes can be positive or negative towards that behavior.

395
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:38,080
What determines a positive or negative evaluation is our behavioral beliefs in our valuation of our behavior.

396
00:50:39,430 --> 00:50:46,900
So what this means is that we have to make an evaluation of both the behavior and the outcomes that result if we perform the behavior.

397
00:50:47,350 --> 00:50:57,190
So take, for example, the idea of exercise. My attitude towards exercise would be by some evaluation of the act of exercising.

398
00:50:57,250 --> 00:51:04,100
I don't like it or I dislike it and would also evaluate the outcome that would result if I engaged in the B.

399
00:51:04,450 --> 00:51:09,849
In this case, my evaluation might be that it helps me lose weight.

400
00:51:09,850 --> 00:51:15,909
There's a particular outcome that comes out of the both of these are positive responses.

401
00:51:15,910 --> 00:51:32,140
Therefore, my attitude might be positive towards. And then there's objective norms and normative beliefs.

402
00:51:32,150 --> 00:51:39,879
So we know that from our readings that normative beliefs are whether people in our lives approve or disapprove of the behavior,

403
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:42,130
in other words, what they think of their behavior.

404
00:51:42,550 --> 00:51:49,300
So motivation to comply is whether an individual is motivated to meet the expectations of those normative goals.

405
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:53,330
Our subjective norms comprise both of these factors.

406
00:51:53,330 --> 00:51:56,120
And then again, they can be positive, negative or neutral.

407
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:05,030
So our subjective norms can be neutral when our normative beliefs show some sort of approval for behavior.

408
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:10,640
But we don't want to combine positive and negative or neutral.

409
00:52:11,390 --> 00:52:15,470
Neutral means less motivated to comply with those normative.

410
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:32,420
Let's talk about the theory of behavior. So the theory of planned behavior was developed out of the theory of reason and a realization

411
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:36,560
that we sometimes don't have control over our behaviors and our ability to perform them.

412
00:52:37,730 --> 00:52:45,140
So theory or reasoned action was a little more, again, focused on very controlled behaviors.

413
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:56,060
And then the theory of planned behavior evolved that to say, hey, we don't always have control over behaviors and our ability to perform them.

414
00:52:56,750 --> 00:53:02,280
So in the theory of planned behavior, three things determine our intention to perform.

415
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:11,540
Essentially, the theory of reasoned action with some conditions with the yellow boxes.

416
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:18,170
So we have our attitudes, our subjective norms that we just talked about.

417
00:53:18,210 --> 00:53:21,570
Then a third factor or perceived control over the heat.

418
00:53:22,310 --> 00:53:25,780
So these two things feed into our perceived control over behavior.

419
00:53:25,790 --> 00:53:31,910
One is our control beliefs, which are really the presence and absence of facilitators or barriers.

420
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:36,920
And this construct is very similar to perceived barriers in the health belief model.

421
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:42,080
What are what do I perceive as stopping me from performing a particular behavior?

422
00:53:42,710 --> 00:53:48,320
And it could be that there are a lot of factors that went into our control over particular behavior,

423
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:53,390
but certain ones are more salient, which is what perceived power is.

424
00:53:54,680 --> 00:54:06,260
So let's say, for example, exercise against one's work schedule can be perceived, can be a perceived barrier to exercising.

425
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:11,470
And the perceived power of their work schedule is that it restricts their time to exercise.

426
00:54:11,510 --> 00:54:20,450
So in this case, perceived control of exercising is pretty low due to time, and this will lower behavioral intention.

427
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:27,500
There is a barrier to performing the behavior, which is time, and it restricts our ability to exercise.

428
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:42,760
So we're not as likely to. And control buildings, identify a barrier and then proceed.

429
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:52,390
Power is really sort of what is our perception over the barrier and our ability to exercise.

430
00:55:02,790 --> 00:55:10,019
So the theory of reason action plan behavior really provides a framework to identify key behavioral, normative and control.

431
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:19,379
Beliefs affecting behaviors and interventions can really be designed to target and change these beliefs or values that are placed on them.

432
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:28,080
And that can therefore affect our attitudes, subjective norms and perceived control and lead to changes in intentions and behaviors.

433
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:34,860
So the relative importance of each may really vary depending on the population and problem.

434
00:55:35,250 --> 00:55:38,959
So what I mean by that is relative importance of attitudes,

435
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:47,540
subjective norm and perceived control really depends on the issue we're looking at, the population we're working with, but really need to.

436
00:55:47,910 --> 00:55:52,530
One of the first steps is really to figure out the degree of influence and then target

437
00:55:52,530 --> 00:55:58,799
accordingly and theory of reasoned action and really focuses on cognitive factors,

438
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:07,060
beliefs and values. And then we have the integrated behavioral model and other factors affecting

439
00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:11,920
determining if behavioral intervention can really result in our behavioral performance.

440
00:56:12,610 --> 00:56:15,910
So your textbook calls it a model. I would argue that it's a theory.

441
00:56:16,630 --> 00:56:26,680
But I just wanted to be consistent with your book. And this is something you could apply across different behavioral domains.

442
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:34,300
So what the integrated behavioral model tells us that even if behavioral intervention is really strong,

443
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:43,240
you need you need other factors at play to actually engage in a particular behavior.

444
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:48,130
So you need knowledge and skills.

445
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:54,910
You need to have few environmental constraints. The behavior needs to be salient to the person.

446
00:56:55,870 --> 00:57:03,340
And if the behaviors have been shown for that particular person, intervention becomes less of an influence over behavioral performance.

447
00:57:03,550 --> 00:57:09,700
So what we've been talking about so far is very, very individual level behavior.

448
00:57:11,050 --> 00:57:15,010
I haven't talked about anything related to the environment until now,

449
00:57:15,850 --> 00:57:26,830
where we see that the environment does have some influence on our health and there's a lot of evidence to support that.

450
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:34,650
And the integrated behavioral model they finally have, you know, through this one,

451
00:57:34,930 --> 00:57:40,509
have indicated some of those other levels of the social ecological model that we talked

452
00:57:40,510 --> 00:57:46,120
about last week that might influence someone's ability to engage in their behavior.

453
00:57:47,470 --> 00:57:54,459
So a couple of other things that are a little different about the integrated behavioral model is that attitudes

454
00:57:54,460 --> 00:58:01,780
are now broken into emotional and cognitive dimensions now labeled as experiential and instrumental attitudes.

455
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:07,330
So experiential attitudes are really are an emotional response to performing a behavior.

456
00:58:07,340 --> 00:58:13,810
How do we feel about it? And instrumental cognitive response.

457
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:20,890
So similar to the evaluation of behavioral outcomes and the theory of Action and Plan B,

458
00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:28,330
so integrated behavioral model is bringing emotions into this,

459
00:58:28,810 --> 00:58:38,740
finally addressing that aspect of influencing behavior in terms of the especially as it relates to the attitudes that we perform.

460
00:58:40,030 --> 00:58:47,710
And then perceived norms are also broken out or geared to include subjective norms and descriptive norms.

461
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:58,360
So injunctive and subjective norms are kind of used interchangeably.

462
00:58:59,290 --> 00:59:05,110
So this means normative, but it's the same thing as normative beliefs of the theory of reasonable action,

463
00:59:05,710 --> 00:59:10,450
why important people think one should do, and the motivation to actually comply with them.

464
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:15,310
And then a descriptive norm that's different and that's new to this model.

465
00:59:15,670 --> 00:59:20,890
When people in the social network are actually doing what is their actual being?

466
00:59:21,130 --> 00:59:29,470
So there can be norms, things we think people are doing, but descriptive norm is actually getting in reality.

467
00:59:29,470 --> 00:59:31,990
What are people actually doing in the social norm?

468
00:59:34,750 --> 00:59:42,970
And then on your personal agency, perceived behavioral control, what makes it easy or difficult to perform the behavior and then self-efficacy?

469
00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:45,850
Again, not a theoretical whole,

470
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:53,350
but integrated into this model and then confidence in performing a behavior in the face of various obstacles and challenges.

471
00:59:56,840 --> 01:00:01,310
So that integrated behavioral model is really maximized under the following condition.

472
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:08,780
Maximize in terms of behavior change, we have a strong intention to perform that behavior.

473
01:00:09,350 --> 01:00:16,280
We have the knowledge and skills to do so. There are no serious environmental constraints or behavioral performance.

474
01:00:16,790 --> 01:00:21,770
The behavior is salient. The person has performed problem behavior previous.

475
01:00:22,430 --> 01:00:29,120
Now some of these criteria for behavior change being maximized is very similar to the social ecological approach.

476
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:36,110
So I would say these this is the integrated behavioral model, the social ecological approach,

477
01:00:36,620 --> 01:00:46,250
not synonymous, not the same thing, but tend to incorporate some similar sort of principles here.

478
01:00:49,190 --> 01:00:54,290
So all theories have limitations, and the theory of reasoned action can be very integrated.

479
01:00:54,290 --> 01:00:56,990
But your role model all have limitations as well.

480
01:00:57,980 --> 01:01:06,620
Some of the main criticisms of this model are that or this approach is that it's too parsimonious for a theory about volitional behavior.

481
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:15,710
And many people don't like the exclusive focus on rational reasoning, especially for the theory of reasoned action.

482
01:01:16,810 --> 01:01:22,850
And there's a lot of criticism around the minimal role of emotions and influencing behavior.

483
01:01:23,210 --> 01:01:29,630
So we saw incorporated into the integrated behavioral model go with your reasoning, action and behavior.

484
01:01:29,630 --> 01:01:35,880
You don't see as much of that. It doesn't really account for inclined abstainers.

485
01:01:36,350 --> 01:01:46,200
So people who intend but failed to act, they integrated behavioral model got closer to that.

486
01:01:46,220 --> 01:01:53,420
Great. You can still have a lot of intention and there could be many other factors beyond what the

487
01:01:53,420 --> 01:02:00,670
integrated behavioral model is integrated that can prevent people from taking actions where people.

488
01:02:05,130 --> 01:02:08,190
So this doesn't mean we don't use these theories.

489
01:02:08,190 --> 01:02:13,919
They're key mechanisms that may be really instrumental in these theories of models to

490
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:20,280
understand a particular health problem that you choose to focus on for your projects.

491
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:25,180
And there may be relevant constructs here that you draw from as you develop your own models.

492
01:02:25,180 --> 01:02:36,030
So depending on the issue you choose to focus on, maybe attitudes or norms are really critical drivers of that behavior or that problem.

493
01:02:36,930 --> 01:02:48,120
So there there may be elements of these theories and different constructs that you might integrate into buying into very specific issues.

494
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:56,040
So any questions about terminology of the elements of these different theories we covered today?

495
01:02:57,390 --> 01:03:10,610
So you've played super crash course in some of the most prolific individual level theories that have been highlighted in our.

496
01:03:15,390 --> 01:03:25,260
I'm very literal for a reason because, you know, with these different theories, definitions become very important.

497
01:03:26,460 --> 01:03:34,050
And that I would take your models and give you feedback, and I'll be asking you to define a lot of things.

498
01:03:34,050 --> 01:03:37,440
And you know, when we say things like attitudes or norms,

499
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:43,230
what I really understand for what do you what do you mean by that as it relates to that feeling?

500
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:10,450
So. Was this helpful in terms of giving you an overview of your readings?

501
01:04:10,740 --> 01:04:17,400
What was actually explained in your chapters? Simplified it hopefully simplifies it a little bit for you.

502
01:04:17,790 --> 01:04:22,860
I post the slides before class, so I definitely go back to them.

503
01:04:23,340 --> 01:04:29,220
There's no expectation that all of this just clicked in your head between reading at this lecture.

504
01:04:30,290 --> 01:04:34,350
You know, I want you guys to be applying it. You're going to go back to these notes.

505
01:04:35,130 --> 01:04:41,700
And hopefully by the end of this semester, many of these theories and their concepts will start to gel.

506
01:04:43,260 --> 01:04:49,559
So if you're sitting here a little confused or it's like, What do I do with this?

507
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:58,410
Don't worry you for both of these kind of types of theories that we talked about.

508
01:04:58,680 --> 01:05:03,330
They're they're like projective that are not necessarily how you would change behavior.

509
01:05:03,780 --> 01:05:11,000
So is that different or so? Well, we went through the examples where for actual screening, they were able to remove some barrier.

510
01:05:11,010 --> 01:05:19,810
It's like, is that not considered changing behavior or is it like an exception to like what it means like change behavior versus just like predictive?

511
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:26,340
So that is changing behavior. But the health belief model didn't tell us to do that.

512
01:05:26,670 --> 01:05:33,860
It didn't tell us to like when you when you looked at the models, the people who designed that theory,

513
01:05:33,870 --> 01:05:49,110
they didn't tell us that using the role model for someone in the Thornton position would prompt someone to get screened.

514
01:05:50,010 --> 01:05:55,110
There are other theories that tell us that that sort of position or figure or.

515
01:05:55,650 --> 01:06:02,480
Or. A method of getting someone to act has some basis to it.

516
01:06:04,130 --> 01:06:08,840
And what we're going to talk about right now, believe model is intelligence.

517
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:12,190
When you look at all the models.

518
01:06:12,190 --> 01:06:19,559
So if you're with your behavior, would you have to look to add to subjective and perceived control to really predict behavior?

519
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:22,680
Do people ever just focus on like one of those branches?

520
01:06:24,350 --> 01:06:27,530
So you can focus on one of those branches.

521
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:32,810
And next week, we're going to talk about building conceptual models.

522
01:06:32,910 --> 01:06:42,440
That's a great Segway. And to dissect that in terms of how do you take a piece of this to apply it to this

523
01:06:42,620 --> 01:06:46,159
conceptual model that I'm going to put together around this particular problem?

524
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:49,970
We're only we're I only really want to focus on attitudes.

525
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:53,510
So the different linkages do matter.

526
01:06:53,510 --> 01:07:05,690
You want to think about empirical support and theoretical justification to the different relationships that lead to your outcome of interests.

527
01:07:07,010 --> 01:07:18,049
So I'll walk you through some examples of how you actually do that versus just randomly, you know, attitudes here and perceived barriers here.

528
01:07:18,050 --> 01:07:22,280
And it's like, how do they connect? So there is a method to the madness.

529
01:07:33,180 --> 01:07:38,070
Professor. Yeah. So one of our readings. Great. The time to retire the TPTB.

530
01:07:39,510 --> 01:07:46,889
So great in that article. And again, it's just the one article they talk about how the TPV accounted for only 19.3%

531
01:07:46,890 --> 01:07:51,240
of variability in health behavior with intention being the strongest predictor.

532
01:07:52,380 --> 01:08:03,900
So if these theories are so limited, what are the advantages of of looking at them and kind of using them as application if they are that limited?

533
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:10,960
So they were used a long time ago going feel dizzy, feel back.

534
01:08:11,100 --> 01:08:19,280
But I feel a responsibility to teach you this stuff because if you're an internship and someone's talking

535
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:25,669
about the hopefully model and theory of planned behavior and you have no idea what that is or how it works,

536
01:08:25,670 --> 01:08:30,920
or you can engage in that conversation in a constructive way.

537
01:08:31,310 --> 01:08:40,270
I have not seen my job. So so part of this is I want you to sort of get an understanding of how the field evolved.

538
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:42,469
But to be honest,

539
01:08:42,470 --> 01:08:55,610
it's not by it's really not used as much anymore compared to many of the other things we're going to talk about when we're doing our projects.

540
01:08:55,610 --> 01:08:58,190
We really shouldn't focus on this. Is that what you're saying?

541
01:08:58,700 --> 01:09:06,319
So what I don't want you to do for any of your projects is to just take like the health beliefs model or the theory of plan behavior,

542
01:09:06,320 --> 01:09:09,920
piece of action, or any theory we talk about in this class.

543
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:23,030
And just like use like the diagram and then put in code red for cancer screening or whatever behavior you're going to focus on.

544
01:09:23,540 --> 01:09:27,710
I mean, just pop it in there. That's not what this assignment is about.

545
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:37,820
You're really going to develop your own model that really, really clearly shows the different determinants of that outcome.

546
01:09:38,330 --> 01:09:45,889
Behavioral, social, structural. And you may draw from some of these constructs from these models.

547
01:09:45,890 --> 01:09:50,300
So maybe you're going to be focused on something that's a risk behavior.

548
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:56,600
It's considered a risk behavior. You might draw from the health leaf model in some way,

549
01:09:56,600 --> 01:10:04,879
but it may not be it may not look exactly like the whole model when you have when

550
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:08,210
you're thinking about all the things that are very specific to that problem.

551
01:10:08,660 --> 01:10:13,970
So next week, I'm going to show you some examples of conceptual models and how you might start

552
01:10:14,270 --> 01:10:21,440
and go about evolving your thinking and where you might end up going with it.

553
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:25,940
So I think next week I'm coming to life a little more, but that's a great question.

554
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:28,739
If we do,

555
01:10:28,740 --> 01:10:40,410
can we have more like short videos just to see like kind of because I'm just trying to use like it's helping but just to like see to I need them help.

556
01:10:43,350 --> 01:10:45,720
So videos to see. Yeah.

557
01:10:45,730 --> 01:10:54,510
Like just examples are like see how you can interplay that thing like seeing having a visual and it will cut out any animals or anybody else.

558
01:10:54,900 --> 01:11:02,490
I'm a conceptual model of like the different like models that we talked about today, healthy belief model, etc.

559
01:11:06,830 --> 01:11:12,640
So I'm just trying to know. And so having a visual of them.

560
01:11:12,670 --> 01:11:15,680
Yeah. Okay. So posted the slides.

561
01:11:16,570 --> 01:11:20,990
Um, so you will have, you have access to this.

562
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:29,450
So I would, um. Some of these are straight from the textbook, some of my recreated because they don't give a visual.

563
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:35,270
So I just, I put it in a format that you can sort of see how they're related to each other.

564
01:11:35,690 --> 01:11:44,420
So it definitely encourage you to, um, you know, put these sideways, like pull them out from the different slides.

565
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:49,370
And um, yes, that's helpful to use just seeing them visually.

566
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:59,460
Um, I'll, I'll do that for a few, many of the different theories we talk about where there isn't a clear sort of visual.

567
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:04,750
I'll put one in a slide and you can consider that a nice depiction of what the.

568
01:12:10,570 --> 01:12:18,010
Yeah. Is there somewhere where we can see, like, a pros and cons list of, like, using these models?

569
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:23,560
Because I feel like without completely understanding them, it's going to be really hard for me to apply them.

570
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:35,860
So in each of the chapters in your textbook, they do a really good job of highlighting the pros and cons, um, towards the end.

571
01:12:36,730 --> 01:12:39,790
So I would encourage you to refer back.

572
01:12:39,790 --> 01:12:45,130
That's one of the reasons why I have three editions of this book and keep all of them on my bookshelf.

573
01:12:45,550 --> 01:12:48,830
It's something we constantly refer back to.

574
01:12:48,850 --> 01:12:51,360
So again, no expectation of memorizing them.

575
01:12:51,370 --> 01:12:58,120
But you know, when you're thinking about these different theories, the things you should try to take away to figure out,

576
01:12:58,150 --> 01:13:01,590
like, how am I going to apply this to the thing I'm working on right now?

577
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:09,969
Like knowing that like the whole belief model is really focused on risk or theory of plan, behavior and reason or action.

578
01:13:09,970 --> 01:13:17,000
This is really a cognitive based model and the situation I'm working on really a cognitive issue.

579
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:25,120
So it's sort of so not it's not that one is better than the other, like the integrative behavioral model.

580
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:28,300
Is it better because it includes more factors?

581
01:13:28,720 --> 01:13:33,100
Yeah, this is all great. Everything we're learning in this class is going to be very great.

582
01:13:33,490 --> 01:13:37,000
So definitely not like one is better than the other.

583
01:13:37,050 --> 01:13:41,650
And in a few weeks, I'm going to show you the holy grail of changing behavior.

584
01:13:41,950 --> 01:13:45,219
I don't have that. I don't think our field has that.

585
01:13:45,220 --> 01:13:50,709
But I'm going to be showing you the different theories, the limitations,

586
01:13:50,710 --> 01:13:59,230
and some things that are probably a little outdated but not used in the way they used to be.

587
01:13:59,470 --> 01:14:02,830
So hopefully model. It doesn't mean we just like throw it in the trash.

588
01:14:02,830 --> 01:14:08,500
Like there are a lot of different things that came out of that model and it's important to understand that model.

589
01:14:08,980 --> 01:14:17,049
I still have a lot of colleagues who, you know, they may not have a theory background or a social science background,

590
01:14:17,050 --> 01:14:21,880
but that is the thing they pull out when they have to incorporate behavior into their work.

591
01:14:23,290 --> 01:14:28,059
But, you know, for us, it's helpful to understand the limitations of that.

592
01:14:28,060 --> 01:14:40,540
So we can engage in that conversation in ways we can actually use more evolved methods to really solve 2022 problems.

593
01:14:50,090 --> 01:15:03,140
Excellent question. Anything else coming to mind? I think that's good enough for me.

594
01:15:03,750 --> 01:15:12,350
I mean, you have planning to do your theory, assessment and use your notes, books, talk to your friends.

595
01:15:13,640 --> 01:15:23,300
And what do you guys think you should ask me?

596
01:15:23,450 --> 01:15:27,919
I just lights out your names. I found here in Italy, a party is here.

597
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:31,910
Can she come see me? She says, Yeah.

598
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:37,460
You know, you can bring your name plates down here as usual.

599
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:41,930
And if Leah Harty is here and she come see me, you can do that.

600
01:15:45,320 --> 01:15:56,640
So I. I love my car.

601
01:16:00,730 --> 01:16:09,760
And so I chose a restaurant I lot of my.

602
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:24,420
It's been since I've been here.

603
01:16:24,930 --> 01:16:56,040
I struggle to make money. I didn't want to be like, Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

604
01:17:01,160 --> 01:17:13,020
I know you need to be like, Yeah, but there's a lot to talk about.

605
01:17:19,140 --> 01:17:30,580
Strong yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah oh, yeah.

606
01:17:31,070 --> 01:17:48,040
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

607
01:17:48,420 --> 01:17:52,950
It's not your number three I think.

608
01:17:52,950 --> 01:18:09,270
Yes. Because I want to get him out because in the beginning this question was about and I just heard.

609
01:18:10,440 --> 01:18:13,979
Yeah, you know what I mean. Yeah.

610
01:18:13,980 --> 01:18:22,940
And you know, I don't really know how I yeah.

611
01:18:24,730 --> 01:18:38,950
You know, so I don't know what, what we talked about it or I think it's more like discuss things together and I said, no, I don't really agree that.

612
01:18:38,950 --> 01:18:59,070
I think that's why I was like a lot of questions like how do you like group chat?

613
01:18:59,690 --> 01:19:02,760
And I'm not sure, are you free?

614
01:19:02,850 --> 01:19:19,590
That's probably because a friend of mine should be more popular, you know, with me too.

615
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:26,350
But what you're saying also makes us it's a lot like, oh, yeah, I think, you know.

616
01:19:26,620 --> 01:19:38,270
Yeah, I mean, I get this every day and I'm like,

617
01:19:40,470 --> 01:20:02,880
I need to use this research just because I know writing about the issue, sometimes I feel like I have.

618
01:20:03,450 --> 01:20:15,779
So I just feel like it was it was all right.

619
01:20:15,780 --> 01:20:25,270
Well, I have a number of things in life name, but I'm not thinking about that.

620
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:35,129
I'm just get stressed out about it now because I'm not ready that I know exactly.

621
01:20:35,130 --> 01:20:39,700
They just to see that you're on some sort of right track.

622
01:20:39,870 --> 01:20:51,720
And I know 49 out of 50 not friends and I'm like they don't st they seem to like the other

623
01:20:52,290 --> 01:20:57,100
application ones like you understand what I'm saying for and I think I can do authoritatively.

624
01:20:58,260 --> 01:21:04,190
Thank you. Yeah. Yeah. I want to try to balance as well.

625
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:12,320
I think it's just I think that I would say also I think you're supposed to.

626
01:21:16,410 --> 01:21:24,150
You can write not to say she says her name, but that's simply saying those things, that spiral.

627
01:21:26,010 --> 01:21:39,350
So I was like, you know, I just got here.

628
01:21:40,030 --> 01:21:45,560
I got this. I'm like, Oh, her name was No, no, no.

629
01:21:45,690 --> 01:21:52,170
That was my advisor. I mean, do they care about like because the things I'm in, she said.

630
01:21:54,260 --> 01:22:04,380
I even if I would like know, I just read so close to the reading.

631
01:22:05,340 --> 01:22:09,600
It was just I looked it up.

632
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:16,229
Wasn't always like this because I can't I don't want to just sit there all day reading.

633
01:22:16,230 --> 01:22:23,670
There's nothing I've said it has to. I have to play. That's my expertize that maybe that's how I feel like.

634
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:27,450
All right. Yeah.

635
01:22:27,510 --> 01:22:30,920
Like or they can just, like, is just sitting there and just like.

636
01:22:31,260 --> 01:22:38,400
Yeah. As much as how much reading this class was, one that ended up in the papers do on the back of a zoom call.

637
01:22:38,760 --> 01:22:42,299
And then we turn around and how far do you get?

638
01:22:42,300 --> 01:22:46,130
That's fine, but I'm just trying to tell you the ground. I suck.

639
01:22:46,140 --> 01:22:54,670
I'm going to sit here. Which is. What about that? I don't do it. So. And I think we all have to take on a whole new life.

640
01:22:54,750 --> 01:22:58,010
I like it.

641
01:22:58,380 --> 01:23:07,370
So that's a speech I like. I like to write things down saying that I can still get across to this.

642
01:23:07,740 --> 01:23:08,280
In undergrad,

643
01:23:08,280 --> 01:23:18,780
we had a lot of literally I guess it's funny but I do like will try to talk to you guys all these readings but you can engage in your reading

644
01:23:19,860 --> 01:23:31,860
however with the reading in the class and then we would like I'm sure I'll be like you just gave me a super duper anyway that it would be worse.

645
01:23:32,130 --> 01:23:36,260
I hope you come up with it. I'm like, Oh, I'm so glad I have other going.

646
01:23:36,450 --> 01:23:39,170
And he was like the head of public health like, and I'd like that.

647
01:23:39,240 --> 01:23:42,870
But without, you know, schools at work or we don't have your, you know, they were hard.

648
01:23:42,900 --> 01:23:49,350
Yeah. Because he was like, you know, those people are like you got like, I can't even finish reading 5 seconds.

649
01:23:49,830 --> 01:23:53,440
Like there was one person who would you want to take? I don't want to pull up.

650
01:23:54,360 --> 01:24:00,320
Don't look, I must tell you, the most would be crazy.

651
01:24:00,550 --> 01:24:11,570
I mean. I mean, if that were to go, oh, and your name is up there and everything like that usually.

652
01:24:13,160 --> 01:24:20,070
Right. I would watch things or emails are on that one.

653
01:24:20,460 --> 01:24:26,460
Oh that's the one that had all our group names whenever it has all of our e-mail.

654
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:33,010
Or does it like the left to the readings I'm going to give?

655
01:24:33,090 --> 01:24:43,380
I'm so glad they're not doing it. Plus, oh, it's not about access to or discussion about yeah we were here on into oh that's what about this is

656
01:24:43,780 --> 01:24:51,720
everybody's perception so we talk about here like I see I think you're like what are you looking at like?

657
01:24:52,440 --> 01:24:58,501
And then I go to the discussion boards and somebody else, the segment and I thought everybody really?
