1
00:00:31,790 --> 00:04:41,880
Oh. That.

2
00:08:50,520 --> 00:12:34,750
For. No.

3
00:13:26,520 --> 00:21:48,260
I'm sorry we're running late. Yeah.

4
00:30:55,410 --> 00:32:51,290
Do. Yeah.

5
00:33:56,890 --> 00:34:04,510
I like you will be easier for me if we go out to have dinner.

6
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:09,560
So you're not my, are you?

7
00:34:12,690 --> 00:36:29,690
Okay. You're my savior. Yes. They?

8
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:56,670
Yes. Good. I think that, you know.

9
00:37:56,980 --> 00:38:02,140
Yeah. Last year.

10
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:13,500
So we now know that.

11
00:38:45,640 --> 00:39:41,380
They? Yeah.

12
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:48,400
Yeah. And.

13
00:41:16,500 --> 01:04:57,040
I think you. Good idea.

14
01:05:02,360 --> 01:05:07,870
And. But you've just got to think about that.

15
01:05:08,710 --> 01:05:13,190
But I think there's a lot of interest. But I think we very.

16
01:05:18,210 --> 01:05:23,750
Never say never again. Mean.

17
01:05:27,630 --> 01:05:30,880
There has been a tragedy.

18
01:05:33,940 --> 01:05:54,850
Oh, yeah. N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A.

19
01:05:57,410 --> 01:06:01,670
My wife and I have a lot.

20
01:06:05,190 --> 01:06:08,190
And then I.

21
01:06:15,290 --> 01:06:19,440
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah.

22
01:06:19,670 --> 01:06:27,500
Yeah, I. I think we're going to have.

23
01:09:15,310 --> 01:09:30,880
Although. I.

24
01:12:20,990 --> 01:12:25,940
Oh. And more.

25
01:37:40,870 --> 01:44:47,920
Yeah. I.

26
01:48:33,520 --> 01:48:55,450
And. We'll do a lot more you that.

27
01:51:58,860 --> 01:53:05,950
What? No.

28
01:53:52,840 --> 02:07:40,350
Yeah. You're going to have to go back to 1970.

29
02:11:42,190 --> 02:11:49,820
Yeah. Yeah.
